The hotel staff who used to be friendly, warm and welcoming have become distant, cold and arrogant. I'm talking about the front desk staff. Not at all helpful. Not at all concerned about the quality of interaction or serving the customer. The room was not at all acceptable: slow drains in the both the sink and the tub. Uncomfortable bed. HVAC system not yet set to air-conditioning so even the \"coolest\" setting pumped out heat. We had the windows open 24/7 during our visit but the room was STILL like a sauna. I stopped by the front desk the morning after checking in and asked if the drains could be snaked. I was assured this would be taken care of, but it was not. That evening, I asked if we could be moved to another room because of the standing water in the tub and the sink AND the sauna-like conditions of the room. \"We'll get back to you\" was the reply. Never heard back. I avoided the restaurant completely as I remembered the $35 breakfast buffet from my last visit. Too many good breakfast options within two blocks to pay that kind of money. Noise. I realize that NYC hotels must cater to groups in order to fill rooms, but the noise in the lobbies from the hundreds of kids swarming the place was just wrong. There was never an attempt to control this hysteria. On the way out this morning, one of the concierge staff members followed me across the lobby trying to get me to accept the \"offer\" of a car service to the airport. He kept insisting that $50 was the same price as a cab. Ha! I'm not some first-time tourist to NYC. Finally I said, \"Does that include tip and tolls, and will the driver accept a credit card?\" \"No, no and no\" was the reply. Yea, right. I ended up at LaGuardia with a $30 trip charge and $5 toll charge. With tip: $42. I know that extra money is a great motivator, but having the concierge staff pimp for the car service drivers is an annoyance, not a service. On the good side, the housekeepers are wonderful. I need to find a new Times Square hotel. As I say in the title, I felt like I had revisited an old friend/relative who had suddenly stepped over that line into a death spiral. I can't help but wonder if the Park Central is spiraling down. It had been such a reasonably priced hotel option with decent service and a good atmosphere.

Our room was tiny and had absolutely no worthwhile facilities unless you were prepared to pay extra for them, like wi-fi, which the world and his wife provides either as a component of a package, or completely free as most other places in New York do. Park Central want an additional $14:10 per day for this, but it is completely free at Starbucks next door but one, free at the Flatiron, (on the street) free at the apple stores on either 5th Avenue or at Grand Central station and many other locations throughout the city. The room itself was tiny, had a strong smell when you walked in (like cat pee) and had torn/frayed carpets and blistering paintwork. It was also dark as the only window was obscured by another part of the building which jutted out, the bath was tiny, only allowing for sitting in, it was incredibly shallow and the pipe-work for the taps which were on the wall were loose and ill fitting. On our first night there was a fire in the hotel at around 3AM, albeit a very, very minor one which was of such low significance and was already under control by the fire department, but nonetheless the tannoy in our room woke us up as some muppet (the concierge) in charge at reception, chose to alert everyone in the hotel that there was a fire, but asked that everyone remained in their rooms and did not panic, as the fire was very minor and was under control. As you would imagine, panic followed as everyone tried to leave the hotel, but the lifts had been suspended, so everyone was attempting to use the stairwell which had an acrid smell of smoke, which furthered the panic. The concierge was still using the tannoy to tell everyone to go back to their room and not to panic as the fire was minor and was under control, but as it was also said that the Titanic couldn\u2019t sink, this had little effect at subduing the panicking masses. In the event, the fire was so minor it was hardly worth mentioning and the resulting panic was as a direct result of the announcement that there was a fire and as the initial announcement (at 3AM) was to let the residents know that the fire was minor and that everyone should stay in their rooms. After a very broken night\u2019s sleep, which followed a day of travelling which lasted 11 hours and the 5 hour time difference, we were awoken at 8AM by the fire alarm, which after frantic dressing was followed by an announcement from the concierge that the alarms were being tested. This continued for around 45 minutes, with the concierge constantly \u2018counting\u2019 through the tannoy, the alarm sounding again and the concierge announcing that the alarm was fine and if it sounded again, it was because there was a real fire! Of note, the alarm never sounded at all at 3AM, just the announcement that there was a fire, but that everyone should stay in their rooms and not panic. There was no need for panic, which was only caused by the concierge announcing that there was a fire but no-one should panic, so if the announcement hadn\u2019t happened at all as most people were asleep in their beds, there wouldn\u2019t have been any panic, or even any knowledge that there had been a fire at all, which raises the question of whether the initial announcement was even necessary? On the day of checkout, our flight wasn\u2019t until 8PM, so we asked if we could leave our luggage at the hotel as we would be coming back for our transport to the airport, which was possible, but at a cost of $7.50. We stopped at Trump towers in Chicago last year and at the Roosevelt New York at two separate occasions before and have never been charged for holding our luggage, so this was yet another arm to the contemptuous profiteering that is evident at this dreadful hotel, where it is more than apparent that the residents are treated as cash-cows rather than valued customers. Of note is that wi-fi access was also free at Trump and the Roosevelt and Trump also provided coffee and tea making facilities in the room. If repeat business is the key to success, then this hotel will never realise its full potential as I am certain there are many more like me, who would never put another cent of the money I work hard for their way. Yes it is a very busy hotel and I am certain that they make lots of money, but if they treated their customers better and concentrated on short term investment to improve the rooms, they would make even more money and earn a better reputation. It is true that a negative reputation will work so much harder for you than a positive one and I for one would suggest that people should walk a country mile and spend their money elsewhere before stopping at the Park Central.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cThe Way It Is Supposed To Be!\u201d", "Author": "Michael B", "ReviewID": "UR127164078", "Content": "I've gotten to the point where when traveling, I really don't expect much.

Enjoy complimentary high speed internet, breakfast and a $50 Amex Gift Card with this package. When we checked in reception was not at all friendly, barely spoke and pointed to the elevators, without explaining the way they worked, which is actually quite odd. You go down a hallway and turn left and the 3 elevators are there, but to use them you first go back in the hallway to a console and press your floor number and THEN go to the elevator. A little help from the front desk would have been nice. After our third day there, a console was put in front of the elevators which of course was a good thing, except all the elevators were shut down {without warning ) and my husband and I got to walk down 23 floors. Later found out this is not uncommon and when I asked at the desk when they would be fixed and that we had walked down 23 floors the gentleman merely shrugged his shoulders. Back to the special. I was not given any of those items at check in and so after dropping of the luggage we return to the front desk and were told \"we do not offer the breakfast anymore-haven't done that since February\" but after some while was given the 50$ gift card and they acknowledged the free internet. Since I had my reservation info printed but not with me, we later brought that to the front desk and were given 4 breakfast coupons. Again not any of these people were at all pleasant. The free breakfast is very nice and all the employees in the restaurant were excellent but you know what? Every single new customer that came in to breakfast was asked \"do you have a coupon?\" And most did. Hey I thought they didn't do that anymore! It is still on their website. On checkout day our bill was put under the door and everything was AOK so we checked out. The printed bill however was not what they charged my credit card...they added almost 90.00 dollars. I called and they said that was for BREAKFAST and then said it was a glitch and I could call Juan on Monday as this was Friday and so nothing could be done. Of course Monday I could not get any further and was then told to email them. Honest that is what they said they were told to do in this type of situation. So anyways I emailed them and called my credit card company and disputed the \"glitch\" and have yet to hear from Park Central. I really don't understand why they did not want to honor a special they are clearly still offering and why the front desk staff are so unhappy. The reason for our trip to NYC was our 25th wedding anniversary and my sister had called Park Central to have a bottle of Champagne put in our room. After talking to 4 people they said it could not be done unless she faxed her card and id to them. My sister was not near a fax machine so too bad! In some of these reviews I read about their friendly service and I guess they must of all been on vacation or different shifts. The maids were friendly as was all the bar and restaurant personnel. Our room was clean, they were plenty of towels and I noticed some reviews said there was no refrigerator but the king concierge room does include one as well a a coffee maker. The bed was very comfortable, the walls a little thin but even though I am a light sleeper I slept great. Park Central has an excellent location with questionable elevators (I really do think they are trying to update them, but be prepared) so as long as you pay attention to your credit card you could consider this 4 stars.

The hotel is situated around 57th and 7th which is a 5-10 minute walk to Central Park and 10-15 minute walk to the heart of Times Square (where the NYE ball drops) and 30 Rock. Check in is pretty sternly between 2-4. We flew in the morning and arrived at about 10:30 at the hotel and our rooms weren't ready. They have a service at the hotel that will hold your bags for $3.50 per bag, But that's not too bad and safer than a bellman's closet that you get at most hotels. The elevator system is really efficient since you choose the floor before you get on and it keeps things running smoothly. The rooms are nice with very comfortable beds and lighting. The towels aren't rough and coarse like most hotels, but the water pressure leaves a lot to be desired. The beds have one size of pillow and that's large and thick like a down pillow. If you like thin or fluffy pillows, bring your own. They also add a 3 foot small body pillow which is a nice touch. Housekeeping does NOT knock. We experienced this every morning. they simply use their card and come in. 3 mornings in a row there was no knock. We bolted the door after the first occurrence. But they are efficient and passed the \"loose change\" test. We weren't setting them up, but everything was accounted for after they were finished. The hotel is very quiet, but it is off of 7th which is the main street that goes down to Times Square, so there may be occasional fire trucks, ambulances and such that you'll hear. The curtains are very thick to block out light and we slept soundly every night. Nice places to around the hotel also including Fluffy's across the street which is a good place for breakfast as is Cafe Metro (both under $6 for a decent meal). There is a good spa a lock away for manicures and pedicures as well. Lindy's is a good dessert place which is across the street and 1 block away is the famous Canegie's deli which is an absolute rip-off. Sandwiches are $20 and they charge for everything from lettuce to condiments and drink refills. Order only one sandwich and share. They are that large and I'm a big guy. All in all a good hotel. If you want the hotel to be a major consideration for your stay, I give it a 3 out of 5, but if you just want a nice place to sleep and keep your stuff while you enjoy NYC, it gets a 4 out of 5.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Verona, Italy", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel Experience with a plus\u201d", "Author": "frapan65", "ReviewID": "UR126480152", "Content": "I have been for three days at the Park Hotel and the localtion is wonderful, rooms are very nice and large.

I wanted somewhere reasonably central, but not so busy as Times Square and its immediate vicinity, whilst also being in close proximity to Central Park. In this respect it ticks all the boxes - you can walk to Times Square and Cental Park easily, whilst there are subway stops nearby and reasonable quality diners for those nights you don't fancy venturing out! The staff were also good - check in and check out were quick and requests for ironing boards etc were dealt with efficiently. The rooms are also above average size for NY and I didn't feel claustrophobic living in one for a week (although obviously I didn't spend a lot of time there!). Unfortunately though, that is where the praise ends... My first complaint is minor and forgivable given that it is such a large hotel and therefore hard to maintain - wallpaper peeling off the walls in the bathroom, slightly ripped curtain, other minor aesthetic things. The room was clean though so I don't hold this against them too much. The lack of free wifi was disappointing. I know other hotels in a similar price range do provide this. $14 per day to access the internet is ridiculous - you are better off buying a coffee in the starbucks next door and logging on for free! Next, my room safe wasn't working. Admittedly I didn't mention this to the front desk, and if I had, maybe they would have given me a new room, but I was already unpacked by then. Finally, and most annoyingly, my room (and the whole building for that matter) was SO hot! It was early March, I had both windows open as much as possible and the temeperature at the lowest setting possible and I was practically melting!

As for the room itself, we were greeted by a freshly cleaned floors, surfaces and bathroom and beautifully made bed (important after nearly 24 hours plus of travelling from Australia). During our week, the room was always well maintained by the housekeeping staff, who would always greet us with a friendly service and a good morning every day. The hotel is in perfect location for Midtown - within walking distance to what many travellers come here to see (Times Square/Central Park/Broadway/5th Ave etc.) and should your visit to NYC include trips further afield then what more could you ask for than the 57 st subway with entrance literally beside the hotel (handy for Downtown/Brooklyn & Queens) and several other stations servicing other nearby locations in the area. When we first chose the Park Central for our first visit to NY on 2009, I have to admit that the price was a deciding factor, however in both of our visits we have found that it is the excellent service from staff (from housekeeping, room service and not to forget reception (ask for Ellen) that truly make this hotel stand out from the crowd.

It was my first trip to NYC along with a friend. The location and exterior of the hotel is amazing, especially for the price! Looks amazing at night. Upon checking in and getting to our room, our special requests had not been implemented, but that was absolutely fine and understandable as we knew they're not guaranteed. We had a decent sized king bed room. Bathroom is quite cramped until you get used to it, then it's not so bad. Clean but not spotless. Lots of different sized towels, all replaced daily. Water pressure in shower could be better. Anyway, from the moment I stepped into bed (I had the window side half of the bed) there was a very strange, unpleasant smell. I couldn't tell where it was coming from, but it was so bad that I had to block my nose to sleep. When I woke up it was the 1st thing I smelt, and I was revolted. I don't like to complain so I ignored it and got ready for a fun day of sightseeing. That evening when I returned, it became apparent that the stench was there to stay, so I informed front desk who sent up several people who just opened the window and sprayed freshener near th bed area. This helped for about 5 minutes. Then the stench returned. It was becoming unbearable. Someone came up to look at the hearing system as they thought it may have been from that, but it wasn't. And now the heating system was blowing out cold air. So we complained again. They sent up an electrician to sort it out but his attitude was quite rude and I don't know what he done but he said hot air will begin circulating within 10 minutes. But it didn't, and we were too tired to complain again. The next morning I woke up to the horrible smell and my friend woke up ill. We were both furious as this made us waste a day of our 7 day holiday. Not acceptable. Phoned front desk demanding to be moved and they said that's fine. Got a key to another room. Got to the door and noticed it was a handicapped room, not great but not a big deal. But once inside we were very angry. It was a very small double bed room. We had paid for a king room, so what made them think we'd happily move to this one? Complained again. My friend was furious so the lady who I believe was a manager gave us a suite with two double beds overlooking Times Square. This room was much more pleasant, although it still had that horrid smell in the living room by the desk. Upon reading reviews it's apparent this is a problem at the Park Central, although the manager denied she'd ever come across this before... Anyway, the last few nights were much better and we appreciated the upgrade. The hotel overall is great. Elevator system is quick and easy, somewhat fun.

I've never come across this before as to my mind this is part of what you pay a hotel for, and to pay a total of $21to leave 4 bags on arrival and again between checking out and going to the airport simply makes you feel ripped off. I also felt this on realising that to use wi-fi at the hotel was $14.50 a day. In this day and age when you can get free wi-fi at most cafes, this seems pretty steep. Having said this, the room was spacious and light, with decent furnishings and amenities (although ours had a somewhat musty smell).

Long check in line and very mixed bag of people. Front desk looked like it was a 'front' with horrible long black curtains masking something in the background. Upon getting into elevator could not push button for floor. Others in the elevator explained that you have to push the floor button outside of the elevator to access floor. No one at the front desk bothered to tell us that. In addition for such a large hotel it did not have enough elevators for the many people. We had to wait for the two elevatosr to return to the lobby 3 times before we could board it. Room had no radio/clock (which should be a basic feature), no coffee maker (should also be a basic feature), and faced a dark courtyard (so you couldn't really tell what time of day it was). Mattresses were lopsided, pillows were lumpy and sheets were bordering on coarse. On our 2nd day (which was also thank goodness our last day) there was one towel, one hand towel and one washcloth for two people in a room with two beds. Guess housekeeping can't count as it was obvious two people had slept in the two beds. Guess I expect too much common sense. The carpets in the room and hallways were filthy and didn't appear to be vacuumed too often. The walls are paper thin and we could hear every door slamming in the hall way and loud voices projecting through the walls. As well we could hear the tv next door through the walls. The water pressure on the 5th floor was weak. The bathroom is so poorly designed that you can not fully open the door as it hits the toilet! Finally the room was very overheated. We tried regulating the dials inside the radiator turning one to the coolest setting and the other to fan and received hot blowing air. My husband who is usually cool or comfortable turned off the regulating dials as he got nauseated from the uncontrollable heat. We tried opening the 'key locked' window in the room to no avail. We frequent NYC regularly and this was a spur of the moment reservation made because of the location. After all this is NYC how could a hotel offer such low standards and still be in existence? We won't assume anything in the future and let down our guards. Spend the extra money and stay somewhere else that at least offers clean rooms, basics such as a clock radio and coffee maker, and boasts of comfortable beds and pillows. We were never so happy to get out of there on the morning of our departure at 6 am and make ourselves more comfortable at the La Guardia terminal which is not great, but at least it's cleaner than the hotel. Flying home on a small plane I was able to take a nap which provided some decent sleep which I was not able to get in the hotel.

Had a hard time figuring out the stairs - we were on the 5th floor and the elevators took forever as they were on a log in system, and when we tried the stairs, it took us to a service area rather than the lobby. Wish they would have been marked better - we were not the only ones who were getting lost on them! Hotel is within walking distance of so many attactions - if you are willing to put on the miles, it you can save alot on taxi $$. Great pizza places, delis, and bakeries next to hotel, very safe part of town. We had an afternoon flight out, and when we talked to Elizabeth at the front desk, she was kind enough to let us stay an extra hour past checkout so we wouldn't have to pay the baggage fee to keep our bags in the lobby while we got breakfast and walked around Central Park.

First timer in nyc ! Because of the low season, the price we payed was quite low (little more than 100 bucks a night) and we were even upgraded to a better room on the concierge floor. This is why it was good value, as the price payed was lower for a better room. The room was/had : a nice view on nyc, quite (cause at the end of the hall, and on 55th), clean but not that young, the bathtub was small but shower worked perfectly. The only bad point came from the A/c first it is automatic and you cannot choose the temperature, second it had some trouble staying at an average temperature and was sometimes too hot or too cold (sweaty one night and cold another). Location is the best ! it is close to everything and at the same time not in the middle of agitation. The metro stop at the entrance of the hotel is a real plus. I have red lots of bad review about the staff, for me, only the concierge wasn't friendly at all, it's a shame because the maids and the people at the front desk where all friendly and helpfull. Finally i would say it is not a great 4 stars hotel but still a good hotel. It has no major bad points (only the a/c) and the location is very good. We had a great stay and for the price we paid i suppose it would be difficult to do better in midtown. I can't say if it would be true without the upgrade. We didn't use the gym neither the hotel bar or restaurant, so can't say anything about that.

We got a good deal on expedia for this hotel, 114$ with a continental breakfast included. It's located in a good area, 2 blocks from central park and carnagie hall is almost in front of the hotel. It's about 10 min walk from Times Square, and took us about 12 minutes to come back from the phantom of the opera (Majestic theater) so very convenient. There is also a convenience store (Duane Read) two blocks from there and if you want to take the bus tours, they can drop you near the hotel, you will see people selling tickets for grayline tours and city sights. (They are both the same price, and go to the same places but the people working for grayline are much nicer and explain more what you get, I don't remember the exact price, but it's around 53-54$/per person) The lobby is quite large and very modern, lots of couches to sit, and a small bakery if you need to grab a muffin and coffee, it's a bit pricey but it's expected since it's inside the hotel. No problems to check-in, the man in the front desk was very quick and friendly. When I arrived at our room, I was a bit disappointed, it's ok but we expected a bit better. It's a very basic room, it's clean but it's nothing great, looks a bit old and the hallway really needs renovations. There's a bed, TV, iPod dock, safe & basic amenities in the bathroom (soap & shampoo). Don't expect little extras & frills. I was surprised there was no coffee machine, since I really like to have a coffee before I leave, I found that odd but I guess it's just a detail. What I found sad, is when I checked out, the girl in the front desk told me, there was no complementary breakfast included, we booked this place because we thought it was a good deal with the breakfast. Since we booked with expedia, the girl told me there was nothing she could do. I didn't make a big deal, but I was a bit sad, if I had known breakfast was not included, I would have booked one more night at the hotel we stayed before and at least I would have had a good night sleep before the long drive back home. Also, they charge a 50$ deposit on your c/c for any damages (standard for most hotels in NYC) but it takes about one week to be refunded, longer time period compared to other places. Personally I would not go back, I had better better experiences in other hotels in NYC for almost the same rates. Good: -Nice presentation, large lobby and very quick check-in ( I did not have any problems) -Lots of towels in the bathroom -room is clean Bad: -No continental breakfast included, yet it was suppose to be included. I blame this on expedia for false advertising but also the girl in the front desk, she did nothing about it, did not speak to her manager, at least they could have given us a complementary coffee -the walls are quite thin, I stayed on the 17th floor, and could hear lots of noise from the hallway. Unfortunately, there was a couple fighting on the same floor, yelling almost all night so doesn't help when the walls are thin. -$ to use the internet -expensive to park near, 50$ a night, that's 20$ more than the other parking and not worth it.. (I'm not sure if that's with a discount or not if you stay at the hotel, I called the hotel to ask before we move the car from the previous parking -bed is not very comfortable, a bit hard, although my husband found it ok. I did not get a good night rest, with all the noise, yelling outside and uncomfortable bed, I barely slept. -finally I have to include that there is no coffee maker & coffee..that's bizarre in my opinion, at least offer complementary coffee in the lobby...", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aspen, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Service\u201d", "Author": "julie l", "ReviewID": "UR124665783", "Content": "Just wanted to write a note and say how well I was treated my several staff memebers at the Park Central Hotel.

We come regularly from France to visits NY's rich cultural life, restaurant scene and we're known to do \"some\" shopping.

On a longer stay (ours was six nights) you can have a room according to your wishes (we always receive a quiet room, at the back). We heard that the hotel is getting completely renovated next year. Let's hope they do not \"renovate\" the rates. i'm curious to see the result. What can they (definetly) do better?

He had already greeted me & assisted with checking us out & validating our parking. When I questioned him about my car, he called down to the garage right away. When I further explained how long I had been waiting he actually ran outside to the garage itself to personally straighten things out. He came back, told me what had happened, apologized & made sure my car was then next one out.

When I checked in, I was greeted warmly but felt a bit disappointed from that point forward. When I told the front desk clerk that I was hungry and asked if the restaurant was open, he/she said the restaurant was closing within 10 minutes but I could try to order before then. I would have preferred a list of options for delivery in the area as an alternative to a closing restaurant. Instead I had to use the Yelp app on my phone. The room itself was average size and the bathroom was very roomy (a huge plus for a girl!). The counter space by the sink was great for spreading out my make-up, etc.. The water pressure in shower is also great (a big plus!) but I was a little put off that every time I sat on the toilet the whole toilet seemed to detach from the wall. Clearly the room has not been maintained well. Add to that that an outlet cover was missing from the wall in the bathroom and I was getting the impression that my low room rate was due to poor quality, not low season. The thing I hate the most about this hotel was the elevator system. There is a large podium monitor system in front of the elevators. You have to press the floor you're heading to before you get on the elevator or the elevator won't take you to your floor. For instance, if someone presses Floor 4 and you get on the elevator with them hoping to get to your 5th Floor room, you're out of luck. The elevator won't take you any further than the 4th Floor so you'll have to go all the way back down to the lobby level and call an elevator for Floor 5. Once I did make it to my floor, the carpeting near the elevator was stained and shabby looking. It was a bad first impression upon arriving to the hotel. I had dinner in the restaurant one night. In fact, I spent several hours doing work on my laptop while dining. I was so frustrated at how slow the service was considering that I was one of maybe 4 other people in the entire place. I had to flag down a waiter just to get a second glass of wine. Totally unacceptable. As for the food, I had the lobster bisque which was just 'ok' and a warm chocolate cake dessert which was rich and yummy. I used their valet service for a car I rented the last day in town. The front desk made me late for a meeting in Brooklyn by giving me a hard time about my room bill upon check out and therefore delayed me getting my car. I was SO aggravated. The location of the hotel is great; there's no doubt you're in for a treat with all that's within walking distance. But the hotel is shabby and not well maintained. Spend your money at a nicer hotel elsewhere in NYC and enjoy a better experience. Also, it's a little suspicious that 4 recent reviews are by reviewers who have only reviewed one hotel (this one) and have nothing but wonderful things to say about the hotel and mention employees by name. I would be leery about trusting these reviews; they seem fake and planted by people who might be associated with the hotel.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waterford, CT", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Room and Friendly Staff\u201d", "Author": "dewisun", "ReviewID": "UR123986298", "Content": "I stayed at the Park Central Hotel for a night of city fun with my girlfriends!

First time visit of this amazing city. The plan was to use this hotel as a hub as we were traveling between the two states (CT and NY) from Sydney hence the use of JFK in NY. Sydney to NY is a 23-24hr journey, you would feel the full impact on your fatigue as soon you're sit down on your first mattress in a full day. To give a fair and balance feedback I will approach my review using the following simple vectors. 1. Location (Accessibility and convenience) For NYC first timer, budget and reason of travel to explore the city then this hotel's location is PERFECT! located on 7th avenue which 10min radius to the novelty time square, 5th avenue (tiffany and co) and all the goodies (lateshow dave letterman studio etc) plus less than 5min to reach the big apple especially the ice ring. So proximity is a winner with this hotel. Taxis are easy to find as 7th Avenue is a 4 lanes rd and one of the busiest rd. Service Utterly non existence! from check in to check out it almost feels we're bothering the staff. I don't actually have anything good to say about this area.. its that bad! Room (condition, cleanliness and amenities) Room is muggy, dark and old and smells old too. No amenities such as coffee and tea maker let alone minibar. No ventilation in bathroom, dangy, musty and moldy. Shower curtain is almost black. soo big eeew in room. Towels are old and simple amenities such tissue box looked like it came out from a $2 shop~plastic. Houskeeper at least turndown room once a day. Food Once you checked in, experience the room and service we decided to take our business elsewhere. We feel 7th avenue have lots of better option than the restaurant or room service. BTW the cafe right next to the hotel is excellent in my opinion the only american joint that can do proper cappucino and understand the term 'flat white' and I'm not referring to Starbucks-also right next door. Value We paid 130USD/night... now the price speaks for its self. For a 'full service' hotel + location value is their only draw card! it is cheap for any standard even if you compare with YMCA Other tips with this hotel 1. To store you luggage will cost you $4/piece - pathetic 2. The porter/bell man is out there to scam you. with Gimmick like: \"Sir i can give complimentary luggage service if you book an airport transfer with us which cost$65 only..\" Since I've done my research prior the cost of yellow taxi from anywhere in Manhattan to JFK is a flat $45 it is even plastered all over the taxi panel... so i told him why would i spend an extra $20. Mind you NY Taxis are the best! the pick you up anywhere anytime to whatever from the shortest distance less than $3 trip to $100 or more they are upthere with London's black taxis. Conclusion Stay if you're no fuss kinda traveler and utilize the hotel jst as a hub to sleep and refreshh Big no no if you're looking for a picturesque, good service and ammenities hotel.

First of all the room stunk of cigarette smoke and the sheets on one bed had obviously not been washed from a previous guest because they too stunk of smoke and being a non smoker this was a foul way to have to sleep at night. The room was stifling hot with no way of actually turning the heater down so we resorted to opening the windows. The morning after we arrived we went out to explore the city making sure to leave the do not disturb sign on the door as we are always security conscious. When we returned to our room in the afternoon the door was clearly open and therefore had not been locked! The cleaners were no where in sight. I rang downstairs to which the staff tried to blame us, the housekeeping manager came to our room and did exactly the same. She said to me extremely rudely that if the sign was on the door then no one came into our room and that obviously we had not locked it. This really infuriated me as the beds and room had obviously been cleaned and we sure as hell didn't spend our weekend away cleaning a hotel room! When we checked out the \"manager\" did exactly the same thing as the other staff. Not once was anything offered to make up for their major security breach, they blamed it on us and treated us like we were scum. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT STAY HERE!

Admittedly we staid at this hotel because of its bargain basement price ($129 a night). It was the weekend after new years when Manhattan is quiet and all the stores are having big sales. Here\u2019s all the positives about this hotel. Location, Location, Location. It\u2019s a stones throw from Central Park, Times Square, and 5th Avenue. There is a subway stop down the street, a Starbucks on the corner of the hotel and the Carnegie Deli across the street. Here\u2019s the rest: the hotel\u2019s lobby is nice, but was always busy. It reminded me of an airport terminal or train station, a lot of people running around speaking several languages. Our room was disappointing. It was 1924, a king size room on the 19th floor facing the interior court yard, meaning there was no view, only of other hotel rooms. The room was clean and small. The room had a flat screen TV, king size bed, chair, closet and desk. It was not luxurious to say the least, but it was livable. The bathroom was tiny. There was barely enough room for two people to be in there at once. In fact the toilet was in the center of the bathroom in front of the door, so if you tried to open the door while someone was sitting on it, you would take off their leg. One of our biggest complaints about the room was it is dark, even with all the lights on it was almost cave like. We had several bad experiences at the Park Central starting with the fire alarm going off the minute after we checked in. It was a false alarm but it kept us in the lobby for sometime because the elevators would not run as a safety precaution. The safe in the room broke, so we had to carry all of our valuables down to the safe deposit boxes. Those boxes are narrow and will not accommodate an iPad, so we had to store them in the managers safe. Then we had some foreign kids prank call our room about a dozen times. It was about 9 in the morning, the phone would start to ring and when we answered a heavily accented voice of a child would say something stupid and hang up. We finally unplugged all the phones and went to complain to the manager. He was very apologetic but expressed that it was out of the hotel\u2019s control. The last thing the hotel could not control is the room temperature. It\u2019s one of those old builds that has a/c in the summer and only heat in the winter. During our stay Manhattan was usually warm, so we decided to turn on the air. When hot air started blowing out we called down to the front desk and asked them to fix it. They told us the building only has heat this time of the year and suggested opening a window. You would think that by opening the window we would be subject to all of New York\u2019s street noise, but since our room faced the interior court yard it was very quiet. We slept the whole not without hearing one siren. Unfortunately we woke up to our room reeking of onions. We think it was from the food carts on the street below.

In the first few hours after checking in I went out with friends and went shopping. Each time I returned to my room my key did not work. Three times in total. Each time I had to go to the lobby, wait up to 10 mins in line and ask for a new key. The first time I had a problem the woman behind the desk told me that many stores will demagnetise the key when I walk in/out of them given their security system. (Really? No other hotel has such problems with their keys). The second time it happened I was served by the manager on duty, Fransciso who said 'it is due to a computer problem. He barked at me and snarled indicating he really wanted to tell me to 'get ------\", but chose his words wisely.He was incredibly rude. The third time it happened a man behind the front desk told me I must have demagnetised the key by keeping it near my credit card. Strange how that can happen as I keep my hotel key always separate to my wallet. The man from the front desk gave me a new key and said to ensure the key works he said will send security to meet me outside my room and they will access the room if my key fails. As expected, my new key failed. While waiting in the corridor outside my room for the security man I saw a mother and 2 kids sitting on the floor at the end of the corridor waiting for the husband/father to return from the lobby complaining of their key not working! The security man, Leon, arrived at my door, played with the lock for a few seconds and finally placed the security tag in the door and yanked the handle UP (not down as is intuitive to most folk). VOILA! It worked! The door magically opened! Leon stated that there are many doors in the hotel that operate trouble free if the handles are yanked UP. I thanked the kind man for his demonstrated competence and fine manners. Without his help I\u2019d have trekked to the front desk a 4th time! Very late that night I was so DISAPPOINTED with my experience I went down to the lobby to complain. I spoke to a guy at the desk whose name I recorded, Emanuel, and told him the story. I mentioned that from the folk at the front desk I was not offered an apology for this fiasco and not offered any compensation. He asked me to wait while he went to the back office to talk to Franscico. I told him just how Fransisco treated me a few hours earlier. Emanuel returned and printed out a complimentary b/fast voucher given the problems I had. I said to him I was so fed up I was going to write up a negative review on www.tripadvisor.com but given the voucher, I will not do so. I thanked him for the comp b/fast voucher. And until now I kept my word in not reporting my awful time at the Park Central on tripadvisor.com. What changed my mind? The fraudulent behaviour of the hotel did. Today on my credit card statement I find a charge for USD 43.36 (AUD 44.07) which is clearly for the breakfast and the tax and the tip, EVEN though I received a complimentary b/fast voucher (which included the USD 35 b/fast and taxes and tips). It said so on the voucher. Being Australian (a nation of people unfamiliar with tipping and added taxes) I confirmed with the front desk that the voucher included these items and was assured it did.

Leave yourself lots of time. Hotels Rooms: Nothing special, spacious, cleaner than not, we had a King room over looking 7th Ave. and almost a view of Central park which was nice.

What a dissapointing experience. We chose the hotel for Christmas weekend. It was a great location. I wish I could say one other thing was great. The lobby was great! ... okay that's it. The staff could take some lessons from the Sheraton, or the Hilton, or the Motor Inn in Queens. The staff was so blas\u00e9. Even with the 'warmth' of the holidays, they were just short of grinch worthy. I've felt more welcome at McDonald's. I expect more from a staff in NYC. My mom requested information about St. Patrick's Cathedral, location, times, etc. and they suggested she walk there and find out. Thanks. The woman at the desk 'upgraded' my senior citizen parents to the 25th floor, without informing us quite how the elevators worked. So we looked like fools, and frustrated with the elevator. Again, thanks. The room was an okay size. No mini fridge, sort of a boring room decor, and overall 'eh' condition. One little trash can. When we got to the 25 floor, the window was WIDE open. No screen, I guess incase the staff drove me to jump, I could. We thought this was weird... BUT then we figured out why. The heat was broken. Our steps: Let's call the front desk, our room is a sauna. Pick up the phone, call down, get hung up on. Call down again, say hello, here hello back, say our heat is broke, here hello again, then get hung up on. Call a third time (my dad sounds crazy now) they say hello back and forth while I wait for him to be hung up on again and I call with my cell phone. The operator asks me if I've called the front desk, if I dialed zero, if I spoke to the operator. I tried VERY hard to keep my patience. I'm not sure what it was about \"our phone is broken\" that she didn't understand. When the point was made, I said, \"I do not care about the phone. Please send someone to fix the heat!\" We braced ourselves for the wait. Put the TV on and ate soem peeps. A Christmas miracle- in the form of Stanley, the handy man? He came in about 10 minutes. He also pointed out that we had two phones... WHICH we felt silly about BUT we laughed we probably have 2 because the one doesn't work. Stanley asked if we had turned the heat off... I stared at him and refused to answer his question. My mom laughed. Stanley realized he insulted us and laughed. After observing the heater, He told us that side of the hotel was always hotter because of the water heater... but had nothing to say about the fact that it was still emitting heat. Stanley was nice and found us a fan to put infront of the window- which kind of grossed me out (NY Smog). But thank you Stanley. At least you tried and gave us service with a Smile. Stanley, Thanks. The day we wanted to check out, the maid stopped by our room 3 times. Our check-out was 1pm. The maid did not understand this. The third time she came, thankfully we were packing up and she could come in. We used our 2nd phone to call down to the valet and have our car brought around. They said 15 minutes. We went down to get our car exactly 15 minutes after our phone call and even the Valet had an attitude. He let us know, \"I've been waiting a long time.\" My step dad appologized and he just put his hand out for the ticket (or a tip? for being so kind?) Thanks.

Overall the hotel is exactly what you need, but nothing more. I swore I read something that denoted the Park Central as a 4-star hotel and that is what i was expecting. This hotel is NOT a 4-star hotel. It's a 3-star. Some people complained of long lines at check-in; however, i did not encounter that. We were quickly greeted and got a free room upgrade to a higher floor (must have been the 'conceirge floor' b/c we had a coffee maker). The front desk agent was awesome and recommended a fabulous local, sit down pizza place (Angelo's-it's next to the Late Show w/David Letterman Theatre-you must go, it's amazing!). NOTE: we purchased the \"bed and breakfast\" package which included a buffet breakfast. DO NOT DO THIS. the spread included bacon/sausage, eggs (they did not taste like real eggs to me, perhaps they were fake/dehydrated eggs), potatoes, french toast, fruit, meat/cheeses, waffle maker, cereal. sounds lovely, right? The issue we had was not that there wasn't enough food, but the quality and the temperature of the food. we ate there 4 our of our 6 days hoping it would get better-it didn't. the bacon, eggs and potatoes were cold/not hot on all four days. One day my friend tried to eat cereal; however, his milk was spoiled and literally had lumps pouring out of the milk carton. there are a zillion food choices literally right outside the door, i would not recommend eating breakfast at the hotel. The room: it was very spacious for a NYC hotel. the bed was comfortable and the pillows were awesome. It had a nice flat panel TV (which we watched only a few times when coming in from being out all day/night), a desk and a fairly spacious closet. Issue: there did not seem to be any heating or airconditioning. there was what appeared to be a radiator by the window; however, there was no way to turn in on. The window only opened 6 inches and on some night did not provide enough fresh air. Additonally, we were on the 19th floor facing 7th Ave and it was noisy. BRING EAR PLUGS if you plan to get any sleep with the window open. srsly. The bathroom: small and outdated. the shower head needed to be updated and the tile in bathroom/bathtub was somewhat old and could use a good scrub. Some parts of the grout were recently filled, but with a different color. The electrical plugs were mushy and out dated. When all is said and done the bathroom provided the necessities and nothing more. hot water, towels, shampoo and soap. note to women (and men with long hair!): bring your own conditioner as the hotel only provids shampoo. they do supply a decent, small, travel blow dryer. Housekeeping is decent. during our stay they only \"tidied\" up the room once and did not dump out the remaining coffee from the coffemaker. Seems all they did was put new towels out and make the bed. also, i had brought up 3 coffee cups from the cafe from breakfast and left them in the bathroom when i was done and they only rinsed them out. they didn't take them away or sanitize them. that's not sanitary, so i would not drink from any other cups in the room. glasswear must be sanitized not just rinsed out. Overall i was satisfied with the hotel; however, if you require quiet when you sleep do not ask for a room that faces the street(s). i know it's NYC and it's loud by nature, but hearing sirens and honks throughout the night made for rough sleep until i wised up and bought some ear plugs!

The bed was very comfortable, the rug was begining to show it's age. The size of the room was bigger than I expected. We stayed on the 24th floor with no view (that costs more). The great thing about our experience was not the $43 to valet our car (hey it's New York), but we asked the reservationist at check in if breakfast was included (knowing it was not), and she kindly printed a voucher for a complimentary breakfast for two! KUDOS to them! The breakfast was a buffet and pretty good. The best thing about this hotel is the location (near Time Square and accross the street from my favorite Carnigie Deli). You can walk to everything. I would stay here again, but not for $500! I know that they are offering a deal now for $99 per night through the holidays. Take advange of this deal. On the downside: The house cleaners did not clean out one of the dresser draws and we found dirty clothes, condoms and other ucky stuff.

When he arrived, he immediately told me that this safe was broke, and to phone down to change rooms. I did as he said and was told that there was no king bed but we could have a double. Fine! We gathered up all our bags and 2 large cases. We were then given the key to another room. Soon as we walked in we were hit with a strong smell of urine. The furnishings were very old and tatty. The lampshades had stains on them. I phoned again and was told to get another key. I was not too happy by this stage. Carting bags up and down long corridors and up and down floors was really annoying! Our next room once again had no working safe. The man came up again and told us that it didnt work in that room!!!! I was furious by now and went down to reception. When we got to the desk the receptionist said shall I get you the manager before I had even opened my mouth. He was a very quiet, unapologetic man. He gave us another key and off we set, bags and all! My husband tried the card in the door, it wouldn't open? After 2 or three attempts a women opened the door to ask us what we were doing? We had disturbed them in bed! As you can imagine I was now ready to blow. When we got there we asked to see him. \" is there a problem\" he said. We told him somebody was already in the room! All he said was \" oh somebody must have forgot to book it out\" and proceeded to phone the room up and check all her details, leaving us still with out a room!

Once we got to the hotel, it had a very nice view and the room size was decent. I went to check out the bathroom and the toiletries. The shower curtain had boogers with blood stain on it. The toiletries were \"formulated in Switzerland\" and they were really made in China!

Within 5 minutes I had a terrible migraine from the mold/mildew. Immediately I requested another room; rather than meet me at the room with the keys I was told I'd have to go back to the lobby and wait in another line. I finally made it to the next room, which seemed fine, if not what I expected from a 4-star place. As I started to settle in I realized nothing but the TV was plugged in-- I had to go around plugging in nearly every light and the alarm clock. Not a huge deal, but it should have been done and set correctly. I was pretty grossed out by the immense amount of dust on the lampshades, but not as disgusted with that as I was the reddish-rusty colored stains on the desk lampshade. I had to convince myself it was rust, but I do think it was blood (ew). The only window looked out onto the hotel's generator or heating system, so it constantly sounded like a jet engine was revving up under my window. And what passed as curtains (falling down in both rooms, mind you) were sheer white and did not close all the way so all night I had a massive spotlight from across the street shining directly into my face. Needless to say not the best night sleep. I got ready in the morning and went to check out-- the front desk manager approached me and asked how my stay was. I was very honest and said it was not what it should be, I was disappointed, and thought other than the location the place really needed some work. He assured me he would contact me by email/phone later that day and would try to make things right. By about 11 that morning I started itching all over my legs-- badly. I had at least a half dozen red, welt-y, blotchy bug bites!!!!! Immediately I called the hotel, and the \"only\" manager on duty was less than helpful or remorseful. Of course they'd say they never had a bed bug or any bug problem, but I did not have these bites until I stayed there. According to the manager, I needed to take this up with security and file a claim. Once on with security I was told I had to fill out some paperwork and there would be an investigation. Once they've determined if there is anything in the room I would be notified. I still have not received a refund, and I am not sure they plan to.

It is an amazing city with great shows, restaurants, shopping, night life and friendly people. Whenever we opened a map on the street a local would stop and ask where we were trying to go. Can't wait to go back. Unfortunately our stay at the Park Central was very disappointing. When our flights were changed we ended up arriving a day later than expected. I contacted the hotel via email through their website and advised them of our delay. Since the room was prepaid for the entire stay I inquired at check-in if the unused night would be refunded. At minimum I asked if a credit for this amount could be applied to the room during our stay. We were flat out refused any type of assistance by the agent at check-in. Further our check-in was delayed when the agent said they didn't show a reservation for us. Eventually the agent was able to locate our reservation and we proceeded to our room. Before leaving the front desk the agent said the hotel manager would be calling us to discuss our concerns at check-in. For the record, we did not receive a call from any manager or any staff at all during our entire stay. Our disappointment continued upon arriving to our room to find we had a lower floor room, with no view, right at the elevator. From the website it sounds as though this hotel offers beautiful views and quiet rooms. This was not the case for us as we heard street noise, elevator traffic and a view of the building across the street. This hotel advertises refridgerators available for your room. Upon arriving at our room we realized there was no fridge and called the front desk to request one. We were told one would be sent up. After returning to the room a few hours later after purchasing some snacks for the room we realized there was no fridge for the room. I called the front desk, again, and inquired when it might be delivered. I was told there were no fridges and would I like to be on a wait list? I said yes and asked if my previous request hours earlier constituted the same 'wait list' request? For the record, no fridge was delivered during our entire week long stay. I should add that each of these calls to the front desk was an annoyance as none of the buttons on the phone worked. For example, pressing 'front desk', 'concierge' etc or any of the speed dial buttons did nothing. Whenever you wanted to make a call you had to dial the operator and ask to be redirected to the appropriate department. Oh yeah, even better there was a 'lock' on our phone. Even though we had put down a credit card at check-in there was a restriction to placing out going calls from our room. We couldn't even use a calling card. I'd like to say this was the extent of the problems we experienced but it gets worse. The safe in our room was broken. There is no info in the room to tell the guests this. The check-in staff aren't telling the guests this. And why are broken safes left in the room anyways? By broken, I mean that the safe appears to be working. Only after trying to retrieve your valuables from the safe do you realize this can't be done. You need to call the operator, ask to be transferred to hotel security and ask them to come and open the safe for you. Too bad we wasted time like this in our hotel while visiting one of the greatest cities in the world. You should also be aware that there is a time-share style kiosk near the elevators. It is very annoying to be hit up by these staff every time you want to go up to your room. If you tell someone clearly the first time you are not interested in their pitch do not continue to harass the guests every time they go past. The final nail in the coffin was the day before check-out we had to go down to the front desk to have the lock removed from our phone as we needed to place some calls. We were asked by the agent at the front desk how we were enjoying our stay? I said, honestly, that we loved NYC but were disappointed in the hotel and we look elsewhere next time. We were then offered breakfast the next morning and internet in our room for our troubles. Really? All of our troubles, inconveniences and wasted time was worth some bacon and eggs and an internet connection? When you spend over $2300 on your hotel stay I consider this cheap and insulting. For the record, we were still billed for the breakfast and internet at check-out. Although I went up to the front desk to have them remove these charges they still appeared on this month's credit card statement. I sent a letter to the Park Central on October 25, 2011 documenting all of these issues and requesting a refund or renumeration of some type. As of today November 12, 2011 there has been no reply.

It's like she was trying to use \"the force\" on me by saying it so nicely and matter-of-fact-ly. I said \"No, I reserved and paid for a king bed and that's what I expect to get.\" So they magically found us a king room for that night. But the next morning we had to pack our bags back up and take them downstairs and check them into storage. We went out and wandered NYC for the day. When we got back that evening, we were sent to a room for the night. We got our bags and headed to our room only to find that it had not been cleaned since the last occupant. So we headed right back down to the front. They were apologetic and sent us to a different room - this one clean and ready for us. All we were offered was free \"wi-fi\" for the evening (thanks, but my 3G tower connection works just fine). I think that when I book a room for 2 nights, I reasonably expect that I will have the same room both nights and won't have to repack my bags. I think the most appropriate response would have been an upgrade to a room that was available both nights. Now, having said that, the location is quite good.

There is a Starbucks with FREE wifi right next door on 7th & 55th street. FREE!!!! Remember that! The outside was nice, had nice signage to let you know where you are, huge lobby, lots of seating areas. The lobby was huge, was a little impersonal but a great place to meet if you were traveling with a big party. Different elevators served different floors; however, the guests did not seem to grasp this concept. You had to push the floor you wanted and it would indicate what elevator would be yours and it would ONLY go to the floor you pushed. Seriously, people had a hard time understanding this. We had many people get on the elevator and start getting upset that it wouldn't stop at their floor. The elevators were not working when we were there and people were trapped in one of them.

I traveled the week of 9/11/11 though, and with room rates upwards of $600 a night, I tried Priceline and was able to book this hotel at about a third of that. Since I did the name your own price, I didn't have a choice in this hotel, and after I read the reviews, I really started to get worried. NY has had an epidemic of bed bugs in the last year, and any hotel that says they haven't had any is probably lying. But still, there were so many reports at this hotel I began to get worried. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I took all the standard precautions in room 944, stripped the bed (the mattresses are now encased in a zipper, which is standard practice for preventing the spread of bedbugs) and I pulled the headboard off the wall, turned over the upholstered chair, etc and didn't see any signs of them. Other than a lot of dust (the room could use a spring cleaning), I didn't see anything bad. I took precautions by keeping my clothes and stuff off the floor, and I didn't bring anything home either. The room was fairly comfortable, and it was definitely quiet. The air conditioner worked fine. The elevator system is a little weird, but you get used to it quickly. This hotel could improve quite a bit by taking some small steps: recarpet the hallways, don't store the maid carts in the hallways, don't charge for internet access (really this is stupid that any hotel charges anymore), add a small coffee maker to the rooms, and don't charge $3.75 per bag for luggage (again, just unnecessary). The lines at checkout were long, but because my room was pre-paid through Priceline, I had no problems at all. Fixing the kiosk in the lobby would be a great help in cutting down the line. The location was excellent; right near many good restaurants, and right on top of the NQR subway line (which is a major artery to Times Square, Herald Square, and pretty much anywhere you want to go in NYC). So... definitely not 3.5 star, more like 1.5 or 2, but a decent stay if you can get it at a good price.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ann Arbor, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cgood location, clean and comfy\u201d", "Author": "triplovee", "ReviewID": "UR118136822", "Content": "we stay here almost every time we go to NYC, about twice a year.

The window coverings were disgusting and falling apart, in the shower there was another person's pubic hair, and caked up toothpaste in the sink. I went to the front desk to complain about the quality of the room and the Front Desk Manager kept telling me that she would be with me in just a minute. After twenty minutes of waiting she finally came and spoke with me. She spent less than two minutes talking to, seemed put off that I was even requesting a room change. When I told her the bed didn't seem like a standard king, her response was \"well it is.\" And another lady walked up next to her and rolled her eyes at me. They moved me to another room, and it was very clear that someone had smoked in this room. While it is suppose to be a smoke-free hotel, it was very obvious that smoking had taken place in this room. When I called the front desk, they were put off, all they wanted to do was spray the room, despite my telling them I have severe allergies and this would trigger them. They finally moved us again, however, the room was still less than standard. There was sticky parts to the floor, we no longer had a view that had been requested instead were looking at the interior 4 walls of the hotel. I requested on Saturday night an extra blanket, and it never showed up. I'm a teacher who was looking at a nice last weekend before school started in NYC, instead this hotel all but ruined my time.

My review might be a little biased because I got engaged there but I'm sure I can find a helpful comment or two about the hotel! Unfortunately our welcome wasn't the best as when we arrived in the morning we were not able to check in until 4pm. This is normal in most hotels but I would normally expect to be reminded beforehand if we've just come from a long haul flight...also this isn't really what my boyfriend wanted to hear when he was carrying around a diamond ring! Perhaps it was the lack of a warm welcome that put us on a bad start, I do understand that it was a busy time to arrive but you would still expect a happy face behind the desk. Anyway, when we did check in later that day we were sent to a room with a broken safe. This seemed to take a long time to sort out as we had to wait for maintenance to attempt to fix it first. It would have been far better if they had just moved us to a new room (note to hotel manager). I wouldn't let the above put you off (just remember you can't check in until late afternoon). So here are my positive thoughts....once we settled in and the room was sorted the hotel was perfect for us. We absolutely loved being so close to the park! It was snowing when we went but they seemed to do such a good job of clearing the paths and roads you hardly noticed the snow on the ground! The hotel room was really good value, very clean and had lots of room. I found the bed very comfy which is very important for us! The room was bigger then what we have experienced at the W hotel.

Better than what I expected CONS: * Service was hit and miss. Some were really nice while others had an attitude. It was strange. I called down for a blanket and toothpaste that was supposedly \"on its way\" but it never showed up. I called back and finally they sent it, but the little things matter. * Cost for saving my luggage. Not a big deal, but it seemed a little tacky. I arrived at the hotel and 1p and they couldn't give me my room, but they said I could save my bag. I didn't realize they'd charge. Again, its the little things. * I brought my own MIFI card, so I can't comment on the Internet access. But - I suspect - they charge for it in the room. Again, its a pretty good hotel provided you get a good rate. If not, for the price I'd recommend a Holiday Inn Express or a Hampton Inn in NYC.

We chose this hotel in spite of the reviews in tripadvisor because of the price; most of the hotels we checked had much higher rates that week. Check-in and check-out were quick, there were no long lines. We booked a room for a week through Booking; to our (unpleasant) surprise as soon as we checked in they charged our credit card for the whole stay. The rooms are rather old but not too bad for NYC. It was a cold and rainy week in May and the air-conditioner was on, even when we turned it off, it still blew some cool wind into the room. When we complained we were told it can't be turned off completely. However there was an electric fan on the floor of our, so perhaps someone who had previously stayed at the room found the air-conditioner insufficient in the hot and humid NYC summer; that's just conjecture of-course, but I think those planning to stay there in summer might want to look into this further. The elevators to the lobby in the morning required a very long wait, partly because by the time they reached our floor they were very full. One morning we waited over fifteen minutes. We finally understood that at times like that it's much quicker to take the elevator up (they are empty then) and come down again with it. The same is true in the evening when many guests are going out to dinner or the theater. We were told that they charge for wi-fi per device, so if we wanted to connect our two smart phones to wi-fi we will be charged for each one seperately. There is a nice coffee shop next to the hotel, with good coffee, tasty sandwiches and pastries, good wi-fi, polite and efficient servers.

The rooms themselves need a desparate overhaul, both for appearance and cleanliness purposes. The carpets were dirty, the A/C system was very outdated and it seemed like it was either freezing or hot in there.

Do not believe all the negative reviews on this website the hotel was excellent.I have very high standards and had stayed at the hotel Sofitel which is 5 star at London Heathrow Airport the night before my flight to NYC. When we arrived at the Park Central Hotel check in was easy and welcoming by the staff at the desk. Staff were friendly and were lovely to chat to. The room itself was lovely. We had two double beds in our room which were very comfortable and bedding was clean and fresh. The room i found was big, roomy and bigger than other hotels i had previously stayed in, in New York. The room in the Park Central contained plenty of storage space which was very handy for clothes and shopping. I also thought it was excellent that the hotel room contained a safe which was free of charge as other hotels i have stayed in, in NYC have contained no safe or other hotels have charged me for this service. The bathroom in our room was also very nice, clean and the shower was excellent. Clean extra towels were given to us each day which was great. The elevators in the hotel were also amazing very up to date and modern. I liked the fact that on every floor there were vending machines with a selection of drinks which was so handy. The lobby itself was contemporary and stylish and the staff in the lobby were very helpful in providing us with transport to JFK airport on the last day. Generally i felt very safe in this hotel and the location was excellent. Being next to two subway stations transportation to everywhere in New York was easy and it was nice being in the centre of everything yet at the same time being next to Central Park. I would definantly stay at this hotel again. The hotel provided me with an excellent base and was the best hotel i have stayed at out of four that i have been too in New York. I would say the only thing that the hotel could provide to improve service would be to have a tea/coffee making facility in the room and maybe a fridge for storing bottled water otherwise everything else was perfect.

I was in town with 15 colleagues in January and we had gotten a great group rate to stay at this hotel, including upgraded rooms (which should have been the same room type I stayed in back in November). The hotel has a great location near our office and with hotel rates so high in NYC, we were happy to find an affordable option, especially one I could recommend firsthand from my last stay. Unfortunately it was an absolute disaster. I arrived at about 1am Monday morning, got checked in, went up to a room and straight to the bathroom only to find it had not been cleaned (see photo). Whatever was in there had been sitting for a while and the bowl looked all around. There were also hairs on the bathroom floor, several, which just made me feel that the room had not been cleaned. I immediately went downstairs and said that room was not acceptable. Btw, the room size and quality was MUCH worse than what I experienced in the upgraded room before. I was given another room, no apology for the problem in the first room, although I was told to call downstairs to let them know if the room was okay. But that point I was exhausted and just needed to get some sleep, so when I got in the room and the toilet was clean (although there was still a hair on the bathroom floor), I just made sure to check the matress and sheets for bedbugs (no signs of everything) before going to bed. Overall, both of the rooms were smaller than I had been in and overall looked very dingy, old and in general like they need a good cleaned (for example, don't lose the remote behind the nightstand, it's filthy back there!, I didn't want to walk on the carpet barefooted). If it was only me, I probably wouldn't stayed in the second room without an issue. I have never changed rooms for such a problem in the past and I spent more than 50 nights a year in hotels of all star levels. I was mortified when I got to work though and heard that nearly every colleague I was staying with had had pretty bad problems. I couldn't believe this had happened after my good stay before! I took notes of all the problems and called my hotel contact at lunch to say we all needed to be in better rooms or we'd be checking out. Here are the problems that were shared with me: toilet wouldn't flush (2 people, one it was fixed for), shower wouldn't drain (several people), hair on the floor, generally not up to a clean standard, phone was broken, remote was missing from one of the rooms, sheets were dirty and had to be changed on one room. I was shocked that there were such problems. My colleagues and I have reasonable expectations of having a clean room where things work -- nothing fancy, just that. When I called, and all throughout my dealings with the hotel, I really don't have many complaints. They seemed shocked to hear about the problems and really tried to help. While it did take a bit of back and forth, and it still wasn't great when we moved rooms, I have to say that they handled it pretty well. I first talked to my contact who I had negotiated the rates with. I found out that only a few of us were in the negotiated deluxe rooms -- i said we all needed to be in the rooms and she said that she could upgrade me to a suite, but they were sold out of deluxe rooms... what?! that's what we PAID to be in! I told her she needed to refund our entire bill and we'd be moving hotels... well, then the GM called back and said he would move us all Not sure where the rooms magically came from. I got put in a nice suite, clean, good size, I had no complaints. Some of my colleagues were fine with their new rooms, although there was still a handful who said there was no apparent difference between the Deluxe room and the other room they were in (no cleaner, no newer, no bigger, etc), although at least everything worked in the room. This was pretty disappointing. I met with the GM and we did work out a better deal, but overall it was such a disappointing experience that the hotel just was not up to a good standard. If it was just my room that needed to be changed, that would be one thing. I know things happen, but when 90% of my group was appalled by their room, had to change rooms up to 3 times, that's just unacceptable. It's too bad b/c I need to plan a lot of trainings in NYC and we're not taking any chances this time and staying at the W instead. Even in the suite I was in, there was a dull sound of a dishwasher/washer just outside of the back corner of the room (24th fl). If my husband was with me, he probably wouldn't have had any problem sleeping, but it was obnoxious to me and I had to wear earplugs. Overall, I feel that once the issue was elevated, they were trying to help and were quick in responding and trying to find a solution. Definitely made concessions that helped but at the end of the day, we weren't in the rooms we were supposed to be in, and even when we were, there were problems with them, even several days in and after talking to everyone. Management has to clean up for poor front desk and housekeeping staff. checkout was fast and were able to stick to what they promised. bottom line, really depends on the room. i've now stayed in two very solid rooms for the price, but also saw 2 that were unacceptable, along with all those that were unacceptable to my colleagues.", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis, USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, good price, good value for money\u201d", "Author": "EduTravelerMidwest", "ReviewID": "UR94093634", "Content": "For the price, I think this hotel is a good deal.

I stayed at the Park Central this week for a business trip and was disappointed (and pretty disgusted) on every level.

I later took a shower and the drain was completely plugged, causing the tub to fill to the brim with filthy water from the pipes. There were dark, curly hairs all over the room - in the sheets, on the floor, in the sink, in the tub - so it obviously hadn't been cleaned before I got in. There was dirt in the corners of the floors, stains on the furniture and lamp shades and missing light bulbs on the lamps. I finally packed my belongings on the second morning and requested a room change. The reception desk did not apologize for the errors, nor did they offer me a new room. After much convincing, the guy at the desk told me they \"might\" have a new room available later that night and that I should store my bags. I went into the office that morning to find that all 12 of my colleagues had experienced similar problems - dirty sheets, dirty bathrooms, stopped-up toilets and clogged showers. Needless to say, the sanitary conditions of this hotel are no where near adequate for the price they charge. All that said, the hotel manager offered to move the entire group rooms to \"upgraded\" rooms (which ended up being the same exact room on a different floor). While my second room's toilet worked, it smelled like someone had chain-smoked in there for a week (this is a non smoking hotel) and I had to sleep with the window open each night. Our further complaints to the manager about these issues were disregarded and ignored. After surviving four nights here, I couldn't be happier to leave.

Well, all the bad reviews must have stayed at a different hotel, it was perfect! i was hoping as it was the christmas period the hotel would have festive decorations, and whilst walking into the lobby it had several false xmas trees with white lights very cute :) due to BA loosing our bags when checking in we asked the person at the desk to keep a record and they should be getting deliverd later on in the evening she did ask if we needed any help with our bags atleast 3 times but we just laughed it off she may of had a long day.

After reading about bed bugs we checked everything, it was fine, spotless, big television coffee maker, desk, 2 telephones, armchair, 2 bed side tables and lights, and the bathroom was spotless (made sure to check for instant hot water) all park central complimetary things around the room, a walk in (kind of) closet with a safe, coathangers, iron, and 2 extra pillows and a little quilt, the bed had about 6 pillows on it though and it was very comfy to lye in, my boyfriend did complain however he woke up in the night quite cold and had to turn the heating on which was simple anyway.

Because of the luggage still missing the front desk where very helpful by ringing jfk and also leaving our room phone messages of any progress, the doorman (big Al) greeted you every morning asking if we needed a cab he then recommended us to go get breakfast in the brooklyn diner (everyone go its really good and will fill you up all day - ask for pink lemonade its the best). One night we arrived back around 2am and where greeted by a very much alert member of staff saying good morning yet the bar was closed drinks could be brought up to the room haha! As for the staff's manners they where so polite and helpful we booked a shuttle to get from the hotel to JFK no problem with it and it was very cheap, we paid $5 to hold our luggage for an hour and 1/2 and after a trip to carneige deli (cheescake!) we where allowed to check out at 1pm instead of 12. It was a perfect trip and the location well, that is one of the main reasons we chose this hotel and around the christmas period with all the street decorations its loverly, not to mention the christmas cottage directly oppostie the main entrance, its a must if your bringing back trinket things. Times square is like 5 minutes away yet you cant hear anything at night nor in the hotel, we enjoyed it that much were already looking to go back and we may ask for the same room! :) It wasnt just look at getting the room all in all the hotel was brilliant along with the staff and also the little corner shop located by the lifts and back entrance the man working there was so helpful in advising on medicine for my boyfriends fever - advil.

So, we couldnt check in (and she had no words of wisdom or no helpful advice!!) Ended up having to pay for a phonecard to ring home - called my dad who had to go through the palarva (excuse the spelling) of scanning his credit card and drivers license over to the hotel via email so my dad had to foot the bill & me pay him back. FINALLY got into our room - was very spacious and clean, brilliant sized bathroom and they had a safe!! The TV was at the end of the bed and we were able to watch Family Guy and Criminal Minds (my 2 fave shows) Bathroom had a large sink, a bath & shower and a wall length mirror above the sink - there was also a mirror on the bathroom door which helped me get up close to do my eye make up! We had an issue with the coffee pot - it was in the bathroom (electrics & water do not mix) me, being British had no clue how to work the coffee pot, i managed to spill water and coffee in the bathroom and was too scared to turn off the electrics so we ran to reception and asked for help. They swiftly sent up a maintenance man who sorted it out within seconds and a fantastic maid who replaced our coffee and condiments and who also we had to force her to take our tip. She was amazing!! Was a club opposite the hotel - didnt hear a peep from it though. No smoking in the rooms either, it was a long trip from the room down to outside for a cigarette oh and the lifts are rather confusing - odds and evens more or less!! When we stayed there, there was scaffolding all around it, didnt bother me, i was hardly there. Location wise it was good - subway right on the corner - took us to statue of liberty and Soho. Round the corner from Carniege Hall and we walked it to 5th ave and Madison, however, we made the mistake of walking to find Forever 21 & ended up by Macy's (Macy's was like lower down manhattan!) On our 2nd day we walked to Natural History Museum - we took the route past Columbus circle and straight down past Central Park (i had to stop on the way back to gawp at the Dakota building - amazing!) Central Park itself is HUGE, we couldnt get around it, so we went to Whole Foods at Columbus Circle and picked up sushi and sat in the park to rest our feet. You can also buy a metro card and i think its for 5 days (i forgot, dont quote me) on the subway which is soooo worth it, get one on the first day!! I have relatives who live in Lower East, we took a cab there, cost next to nothing! All in all, i love New York City, if i had the money, i'd move there.

Regarding the hotel, my mother and I shared a room with two double beds on the foruth floor from 19th to 23rd December 2010. It was very clean and the beds comfortable however there was no facilities to make tea or coffee in your room which is disappointing. It's not the Ritz but it's not tragic either and for the price in central New York I think it's excellent. It was noisy with a lot of traffic etc from the side-street we looked out onto so I do reccomend bringing ear plugs. One other area we were very disappointed with was that we had requested that we NOT be given a room with one of those (locked) interconnecting doors which lead to another room however this is exactly what we got and had to put up with the couple in the next rooms spoilt child acting up when we were trying to sleep, however as we had been so anxious on arrival to check the beds for bugs we had already wrecked the beds by the time we noticed the door, and finding no bed-bugs decided we had better leave things well alone! Regarding customer service, we found the cleaning staff to be very friendly and helpful, much more so than some of the young female front desk staff who (with the exception of the ladies at the tourist/theatre booking etc desk) seemed to forget that they wouldn't have a job if it wasn't for hotel customers. Someone did charge a days worth of meals to our room from the hotel restaurant to the effect of an extra $100 however the male frontdesk staff member did not argue with us regarding this and amended the bill.

At a time when NYC hotel rates were through the roof, I was happy with the price I paid, although it's still ridiculous compared to other cities. Based on another reviewer's advice, I recommended a room on a high floor which worked out very well. These rooms must have been renovated and I'm not sure if I got an upgrade or not, but the room was huge by NYC standards. It was right across from the elevators which I didn't really like, but it ended up being okay. There was a decent size closet when you enter the room, with a safe, then the bed which was pretty comfortable, but very clean (3-piece sheets, etc) and then a fairly spacious sitting area with the desk and TV. The bathroom was fine, not fantastic, but plenty of counter space. My main complaint about the hotel is that the air is impossible to find. After calling down several time with them giving me detailed info, I finally found the little slot that you have to touch just right in order for the top to pop up to allow you to change it. I was freezing when I woke up the first morning (I had arrived very late at night so didn't fully explore the room) and after pulling back the curtains, I realized that there was a full door to the outside of the building that wasn't locked and therefore was cracked just the slightest bit open, letting in cold air. This is extremely dangerous regardless and I checked each night to make sure that door was secured, but I'm surprised they can have that on the 21st floor to begin with. I had trouble getting the internet to work and later learned it was an issue with my laptop, but there is an outside number to call and I've never had such helpful service. The location was perfect, a short walk to Madison and 5th avenues and although a bit farther, walking to Times Square isn't out. I was there for business so I didn't get to see actual distances to other places. I know it's very near to Central Park as well. I didn't eat or drink at the hotel - although they left water by the bed which was a nice touch, but there were plenty of places to choose from just outside the hotel. For the price I got during an otherwise expensive time, and the size and quality of the room, I would definitely consider this hotel again and recommend it to others.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quebec City, Canada", "Title": "\u201cThe mushroom room\u201d", "Author": "souris87", "ReviewID": "UR84151336", "Content": "We stayed in this Hotel for a few days in the summer of 2009, and everything was fine, enough for us to go back at this same Hotel on the summer 2010.

What I got was a single room with two double beds. Additionally, the rug was dirty, the TV did not work, the curtain was wrinkled, the light was out by the closet, there were no additional blankets, the shower curtain rod was sagging, the shower curtain was cut, the shower head was loose and sprayed the bathroom, and the hair drier would cut out after only a few minutes.

The next day (Monday) my wife went down to speak with a manager and was told there wasn\"t one available!!!! However, one of the staff (I think her name started with a N) listened patiently to our problems and had us moved to room 2240. OK this was better but it still wasn't what I reserved and confirmed by Ms Narine YOUR reservations clerk. Additionally, the TV did not work, the alarm clock did not work, the safe was in a locked position and the curtains in the room were wrinkled.

Worst hotel I've ever stayed in!\u201d", "Author": "Travelergal022", "ReviewID": "UR76841300", "Content": "I saw photos of the website and thought this looked like a nice little boutique style hotel to stay in, right near Central Park. The ONLY good thing about this hotel is the location 2 blocks south of the park. However there are many other hotels in the same area that are a thousand times better like the Sheraton NY. This hotel looks old and is very depressing. The service is the worst I have EVER had and I would tell anyone reading this to run as far as you can from this pit! The service at this hotel was so bad, I am having trouble remembering ALL of the problems. Here are a few: 1. Upon check in -no one smiles and the ladies at the front desk are rude. Evelyn was so rude, that my extremely mild-mannered colleague about flew off the handle. 2. Every day after the room was \"cleaned\" we had to call to get towels, toilet paper, kleenex and glasses. The only thing they did was make up the bed. And often had to call up to 3 times, waiting around and they never came up with the missing items. 3. Went to change rooms because ours had so many problems and was on one of the lowest floors, which are usually the worst. After being told it was no problem, went downstairs and Evelyn said it would be $3.50 per bag to store our bags until the new room opened up...first of this news. Later when we returned, NO ONE blocked a room for us and stuck talking to the awful Evelyn again, she said they didn't really have double beds above the 8th floor - YEAH RIGHT! New room had barely working AC. 4. We were there for a trade show and the staff had never heard of it (the biggest of its kind in the country) and finally we saw a sign about it hidden in the back alley that gave the wrong location for shuttle pickup. 5. HERE's the topper.... We reserved a house car to get to the airport on our final day. They said it was all set for us and they take credit cards. Next morning, we went down and it was not there for 25 minutes. Then the driver who finally showed up got into a car accident on the way. A car hit the side right next to me. The driver NEVER apologized or asked if we were okay. It took over 45 minutes for a replacement to show, who also never apologized. We were almost an hour and half late to the airport, shaken from the accident, and still no apology...and they had the balls to charge us for the trip! Best part - the guy insisted we go inside the airport to get cash because he wouldn't take a credit card!! After they assured us they would. Then he finally said he would for a 10% fee!!!! One closing word, if any manager from the hotel reads this - you MUST talk to your staff about service...it is appalling. Also, what is with the elevator assignments ---what is the point? There are only 2 elevators for the lower floors and it doesn't know how many people are boarding it per floor, so it doesn't help. In fact, every single time I was on there, multiple people couldn't get off at their floor and didn't know why. The small sign explaining this procedure, that offers no value, was in English and most of the customers are European...think about it!", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Compton, California", "Title": "\u201cService so bad - I walked out before I even checked in\u201d", "Author": "Fred32242", "ReviewID": "UR76568841", "Content": "The worse bullying hotel management I have even seen.

In addition, the air conditioning did not work properly and the room and hallways had a mildew smell and the toilet had to be flushed a number of times to work properly. The hotel gym looks impressive but the A/C was not functioning and most of the equipment was inferior quality and in need of repair.

I travel a lot with my company (we had 3 rooms at the hotel for 5 days each) and have rarely had such a negative experience.

None in my room, and I was there for 5 days. Here's the thing to keep in mind about Park Central: I had a two-bed hotel room for just over $200 per night--a deal in NYC near Central Park. It's not a 5 or 4-star hotel; it's a 3-star which is fine if you go there with that expectation. My room was clean and fine for the stay. If you're used to being catered to, it's not for you; if you're able and prefer to haul up your own bags to your room, you won't care about not being fussed over. If you want a view, you'll probably pay more than I did so keep that in mind as well. Internet: Don't buy it from the hotel; go to Starbucks or Tisserie (or sit in the hotel lobby and also log into those same networks for free.) Staff wasn't honest about that when I asked what people in the lobby were logging into. so that's a minus. Also negative; my room was one of those adjoining ones with a door; fine if you have quite neighbours, not if not. (Comfy beds btw.) On the plus side, very helpful concierge service. Also a plus, location. But don't buy food at the hotel or at the tourist restaurants if $ is a factor; buy breakfast from Sbux or Tisserie or Europa Cafe, or one of the many convenience stores that ring the hotel. For lunch and dinner, walk a couple blocks away from the main Times Square streets and find a non-tourist restaurant which will have better prices and superior food.I recommend Iguana's, just around the corner from the David Letterman show a few blocks (to the west of Park Central and on 8ave and 53rd or 52nd if I recall correctly).

It was plugged into my car with wires and everything, what a disgusting hotel. So I called the parking service, and explained my story and they lied to my face, saying that they will file a report and start an investigation, without taking my name down. I asked for the manager and he said that he was on vacation, asked for the supervisor and he said he was on vacation. Anyways, the details are not important although I have told you most of them.

Disgusted, we grabbed a few photos on my phone and we went down to the front desk. The night manager was retrieved and repeatedly told us he had never heard of bedbugs in his hotel and didn't believe us. We asked for a refund, and he said he would refund the week, but charge us for this night. We told him that was unacceptable. We told him the room was inhospitable and he kept repeating, \"there are no bedbugs in this hotel.\" We offered to show him the room, he refused. We offered to show him my photos, he refused.

Close to everything! Subway entrance right at side entrance. Check in was quick and efficient with a very polite receptionist. Whilst we were early, a room was immediatly made available. Must agree with other reviewers on their comments about the drab rooms. Our room was large and spacious but lacked a fold out suitcase stand and armchair that other rooms on our floor appeared to have.Note: the room does not have tea/coffee making facilities or bar fridge. Ic e is obtainable on each floor, although for the duration of our stay, the ice machines on our floor (10th) and the 9th were out of order. The furniture whilst appearing to be fairly new, was scuffed with chipped paint and appeared to be be in need of of some maintenance. My wife was appalled at the state of the shower curtain badly stained with mould; a phone call to guest relations resulted in a new curtain 4 hours later. Wish the same could be said with the other problems in the bathroom: mould in the grouting surrounding the bath and a light above the bath/shower that was inoperative from thesecond day of our stay and stayed that way until checkout on the fourth day. The light over the sink was a dull cold fluro. Their maintenance program really does need improving. Other than our initial contact with reception, there was no interaction with the staff, except on our final day when we again checked out - although their preferred method appears to be an automated machine. Upon checking out the in room menu, wa samazed to see a glass of wine was $13 plus tax, plus gratuity; this was fairly indicative of the absurd prices this hotel charges. $19 for two beers in the bar!!!

The bar was ridiculously overpriced even by NYC standards and you will be charged to store your luggage before or after your stay. We were here for a small conference and honestly the 'ballroom' was dated, dirty, poorly lit and in a sub basement. The restrooms were about one notch above a gas station (in the woman's room only one door had a working lock). They were obviously not updated with the rest of the hotel. Not an inspiring place to learn something new! If you needed a place to stay centrally for a night or two, this would be okay, but with all the lodging options in a city the size of New York, I'd look elsewhere first. But note that I think the concierge service is a third party service not connected to the hotel so don't expect the staff there to even be able to tell you where things in the hotel are located.

Starting out with the trash behind the dresser (which was not cleaned up until 9pm that night after three calls to housekeeping and an eventual call to management). Mildew in the shower (which was eventually worked on however the stains remain which is a sign of inadequate upkeep). In the morning we thought there was an eclipse of the sun because our rooms were so dark however since we had interior rooms it turns out there is no natural light in the room. This is not disclosed on the website when booking your room-we eventually called our rooms the \"batcave\" because you would have to turn on most of the lights in your room during the day to see anything. We booked the rooms for five nights and paid over $2000 to the hotel and thought the service would be better. By the third day our room keys had expired because the desk personnel could not figure out how to program our keys for the entire five day stay. This was very inconvenient since we had arrived back at the hotel at 11pm and could not get into our rooms. After calling to the front desk they said security would have to come up to let us in (which was to be about 5 minutes). Waiting 20 minutes we were still not in our rooms and had to go back to the front desk to get the keys fixed. Considering we were traveling with an elderly parent this was very frustrating. Although the location is nice and we were eventually offered a slight adjustment (and I mean very slight) to our account there are much better options if you want to stay in this area of NYC. The Sheraton Towers are right down the street and have nice room with actual daylight. The Park Central clearly needs some major upgrades to the rooms and full disclosure on their website about what rooms you are booking (obviously exterior rooms have daylight). I would pay more for nicer rooms that had natural light and no mildew. Management is very good at saying \"I'm sorry\" however the follow-up is lacking. All I can say is that I'm sorry I stayed at this hotel....pay a little more and have a much better experience at a different hotel.

I would believe this would be plenty of time to have the room ready.

Empty Macy's bags on the bed, hand written notes on the dresser and side table, disposable razor and used toothbrush in the bathroom, long black hair in the tub, etc. I spent the first part of my night filling both Macy's bags with the trash I collected throughout the room, and the second part of my night trying to get to sleep after that very unpleasant experience. First thing in the morning, I brought it down to the front desk. They apologized and said they would have someone re-clean the room right away. I don't believe the maid came to my room once for the rest of my stay there. Which is actually fine with me because I was not about to leave a tip for the initial awful service. The Front desk asked if I had breakfast and I indicated I had not but that I had to get to work. He said that was too bad because he was going to offer me some complimentary breakfast. Apparently I could only be compensated for my troubles that morning and since I was busy I just lost out on it, even though I was staying in the hotel for another two nights. I mean come on, you can't offer me a voucher for another day? Do I really have to ask you to do that after the awful state of the room I had found? The quality of the room and the initial trash cleaning I had to do totally soured the whole stay. And there were other issues with the room as well. The cord for the side lamp was stretched across the corner of the room to the outlet which seems like a safety hazard. There is no temperature control on the unit by the window, so i was either freezing or too warm most of the time. The curtains were pretty see through and the heavy curtains don't pull closed so there is nothing to block the lights from outside. And since all the glasses had the covers off them, I didn't dare go get ice so I could even have a glass of water before bed. There was mold/mildew growing on the lip of the tub. It's like they spent a lot of money to make the lobby and lounge look great, but the rooms were like staying in a cheap motel, not a nice hotel.

The first thing we did when we walked into our room was go into the bathroom and turn on the shower - hot water right away. That eliminated our first concern. Our second concern was the bed... Previous travelers noted that the beds were rock hard. Not the case in our room - we slept like babies the entire time we were there... The one complaint we have is that the heater in the room did not work. We were chilly one night and turned it on. It pushed out air, just not hot air... other than that night, we didn't need heat... and it wasn't a deal killer for us. The hotel staff was overall helpful.

You won't get that here - you get what you pay for - which is a very fine 3+ star hotel. First the room - we reserved a 2 room suite for a family of 4 - great rates made this a good NYC deal at 40% off rack room rates. Not sure I would pay normal rates for the suite, but it was very nice. The separate bedroom and living room were perfect for us as we were traveling with 2 teen boys and needed the extra space. Queen bed was extremely comfortable, sofa pullout was fine for the kids, and the 2 flat screens were nice. We had no issues with an cleanliness - the rooms and bathroom were cleaned appropriately throughout our 3 night stay. Extra pillows, bedding and towels were brought up within 45 minutes our our request. Wake-up call was provided as requested. There is a large volume of people that stay at this hotel so the hotel lobby/elevator area can seem busy at times. However, I never waited longer than 1 minute for an elevator at any time, the concierge desk was helpful (and genuinely interested in helping), and the bellman notified us when our car arrived (we had arranged for a town car in advance - I suggest you do this too if you are concerned about what some of the other reviewers mention about deals between drivers/bellmen). The proximity to the subway is unbeatable. Literally you walk out the door, and the subway entrance is right on the corner. It provides access to the N-R-W-Q lines, which can easily connect you to any other lines you need. Nice cafe across the street for breakfast - Park Cafe - quick service and great food. Also appreciated the Subway (sandwich shop) located across the street for the late night munchies of teenagers. We did not utilize any of the bars or restaurants in the hotel. Didn't use the fitness facilities either but they are large and very nicely stocked with mulitple treadmills, elypticals, etc. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to others. We had NO issues with noise whatsoever - either from outside or other rooms. Also, appreciated the ability to open the windows a bit (hard stop at 3-4 inches) to allow fresh air in the room. This was a great value for the money (mind you 40% off rack room suite rates), and we would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cTurning into a dump.\u201d", "Author": "Aupoil", "ReviewID": "UR60434413", "Content": "I used to love this hotel but now it is turning into a dump.

I didn\u2019t originally want to stay at this hotel but was running out of time to book it and this was the only one within my price range as they had an offer on. It was the best choice I made as all the others I was wishing to stay at turned out to be awful and the Park Central was great. It\u2019s only a couple of blocks from Times Square and everything is within walking distance. The exterior display looks quite posh at night when all lit up and the lobby was really clean and elegant. The staff were really helpful, especially the concierge who helped us find shops and other attractions nearby. We didn\u2019t have to wait anytime at all for check in but they told us we could have an upgraded room as no non-smoking rooms were available, or wait 45 minutes for the standard room. Obviously we took the upgrade. We had two double beds and it was a generous sized room and bathroom, much nicer than the ones I had been looking at before booking it. I found the hotels d\u00e9cor all quite contemporary as well which I prefer, unlike most of the other hotels. Our safe wasn\u2019t working so I called reception who sent someone up straight away and fixed it. I was a bit disappointed with the view from our room but to be honest unless you pay for a Times Square view room you won\u2019t be able to see much in any hotel in New York. The room was cleaned everyday while we were out and fresh towels left. As we were here for Christmas I was glad the staff were all festive and friendly. They had a piano player some nights in the lobby which was nice also and I just generally found the hotel brilliant, especially as I was so dubious at staying there. I recommended it to a friend when I returned home who then stayed there and also loved it. I\u2019m going back to New York next year but as I booked through Virgin and they don\u2019t offer this hotel I\u2019m not staying there again, although I do want to, I\u2019ll have to see if the next hotel is as good. I would definitely recommend the Park Central as you get good value for money when comparing it to other same rating hotels, plus for the price you won\u2019t find a better place for location. Whatever you do don\u2019t get a shuttle to take you to the hotel, was the worst part of any holiday I\u2019ve ever had. The drivers changed twice, drove like lunatics, kept swapping people around, stuffed about 9 people in one shuttle, and it took two hours to get to the hotel. We got a hotel town car on the way back to JKF and it only took 45 minutes and was as cheap as getting a taxi. If going around Christmas make sure you go ice skating in central park, it was amazing and really festive. Also there is a Jekyll and Hyde restaurant nearby that put on a show while eating and is great fun. All the waiters/waitresses are in character and come round while you eat. We actually ended up going here for Xmas dinner \u2013 very untraditional but it was good.", "Date": "March 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cPERFECT LOCATION\u201d", "Author": "Pat2Glasgow", "ReviewID": "UR57467599", "Content": "This hotel is perfect for Central Park, shopping 2 blocks away with all the designer stores and times square a 5 minute stroll.

Third-party prices fill rooms, and provide the business with opportunities to sell services and win future customers. My advice: pay attention to reviews, articulate your needs clearly (both in advance and on arrival) and speak directly and immediately to management if your expectations are not met. If basic room needs are unmet, ask management for adjustment; if unresponsive, tell the 3rd-party vendor in writing; use snail mail to the company\u2019s street address and direct to Customer Service VP. I\u2019ve found them responsive. Talk to local management directly and pleasantly: they value meaningful guest feedback and often can use information you provide to correct persistent problems. Whatever rate you paid, be courteous and civil to a fault: it never helps to be confrontational. Commend with care what is commendable.] This is a Priceline 3.5 star and cost me about $95: 7 months in advance, probably would have been less 4 or 3 months ahead. COMMENDABLE: Smooth check-in, beginning with a Pre-check at noon, assignment of room at 2 PM, polite employees. Ellen was exceptional. Fresh apples at check-in. Luggage stored 12-2 for a fee per bag, discounted at checkin. King bed, wonderful bedding. Quiet interior room. Expensive ($14.04) but flawlessly operating internet service, wireless in room. GREAT midtown location. Lincoln Center and Fordham are six blocks; Carnegie Hall is across the street. Theatre-close. Simple amenities in bathroom, but clean with a working tub and shower, good hot water. SLPPY, TROUBLING and MAYBE FIXABLE: This is a huge hotel, 1000+ rooms. Elevators work on N side to 8th floor only, S side 9-25. Logic to this? Not explained at checkin, but it could be. Elevators controlled (sometimes) by touch-screen system outside, not by buttons inside, obviously confusing to many guests. Not explained at checkin, but it could be. My room was as far as it was possible to be from an elevator, possibly troubling to a customer who had difficulty walking. Cell phone signal reception allowed text messages but voice reception sloppy on interior rooms, fine in the lobby. That\u2019s a structural problem of the hotel\u2019s interference with voice data. Lobby is large, often filled with guests and luggage awaiting rooms or to depart. It\u2019s noisy already, and piped in rock and pop--everywhere-- adds badly to the already-confusing din. Very expensive on site restaurant, but many options close by: all-day breakfast diner at 58th and 7th, Cosmic Diner at 8th and 52nd, Great American Health Bar (Fab) at 6th and 57th, all reasonable. Subway on corner of 55th. Starbucks on footprint, access from outside and crazy crowded, normal for a NYC Starbucks. Phone rates not published in room. Business center up stairs from lobby, difficult for a handicapped customer. 35c a minute, $5 minimum. JUST TROUBLING: A restaurant server engaged me in a verbal battle over a simple order: I just wanted fruit and two scrambled eggs. Not skillfully, he tried to blame the computer for not being able to take such an order and led me to the buffet, which I did not want. I can be told NO but battling a hotel guest is not acceptable.

The Park Central was nicely located for what our main reasons to visit New York this Christmas (2010). Central Park being right there, walking distance to the National History Museum, Rockafella and Times Square. However - if we're being honest, within reason everywhere is walkable in Manhattan. I'd recommend avoiding staying within 5th to 8th Avenues as you'll struggle to get a taxi to take you all the way back at the end of a long day - most offering at best to drop you 2 blocks away - Not alot much after 10 hours on your feet it would be a nice little luxury to get dropped at the door. The hotel itself - For our $1000 (3 nights) we got a small room (with no heat control), narrow corridors, smoke smelling bathroom and elevators that didn't work. The latter meaning taking the graffiti stairs including something resembling a dinosaur cross reindeer with big bright red genitals..... very nice. We got room service once and had to send it back as it was missing items and was cold. In fairness the hotel did replace and didn't charge us for it without us even suggesting. Actually the staff themselves we're friendly and helpful, especially those on the front desk. The breakfast is ridiculously over priced at $25 for basically scrambled eggs, sausages bacon and juice. A quick walk and you'll find plenty of cafe's with better deals.

After working for a week in LA, I went to New York for a bit of a break before heading back to Melbourne. It has been 13 years since my last visit there. After reading the many negative reviews, I prepared for the worst. I entered this large hotel and found the reception area nice, clean and spacious and the reception staff were very courteous and welcoming. Could this be the same hotel I was reading about on Tripadvisor? They gave me my room key for the 17th floor and I was very nervous as I entered the key to open the door. I thought, how bad can the room be? To my shocked surprise, the room was bigger than what I thought. The king size bed was massive, the widescreen TV was great and the room smelt nice. One last check was the bathroom and, lo and behold, not once trace of fungus or odour and, for New York and for a single, it was big enough. I will definitely be staying at this hotel again but I will be sure to get the same room as I heard other rooms on the lower levels may not be as nice.

The boots have not been found and we all know those boots didn't walk out of that hotel alone. It is a shame that I was not transferred to Hotel Security when I first called because perhaps they could have reached the person responsible for cleaning that room sooner. Four different occasions I called this hotel over the course of a week and no one ever returned the call. It is a shame there aren't measures in place to ensure that items left behind aren't returned to their owner. A pair of boots can't be slipped in to anyone's pocket and they didn't go down with the laundry. Additionally, they could not have been taken by the next guest in this room as they were left by the closet door where someone would have vacuumed. I have asked for reimbursement for my boots. A check for the purchase price of the boots is all I want and I don't think unreasonable to ask at all. The hotel should have security measures in place that eliminate the chance staff can walk out with guest items.

The bed was comfortable the pillows soft and it was absolutely SPOTLESS, I'm talking about the edges of the floor where the carpet met the wall. It looked brand new!. Also, the acid test for me is to walk around in a pair of white socks. That will tell you how clean a room is and trust me this was immaculate after 3 days the socks were still white. The bathroom was like new, no mold no dirt at all just shiny and clean. When ever we travel and get to a hotel room, my husband always says to me first thing \"before I unpack are we staying?\" Because if there is anything not right i always insist on moving and trust me its happened A LOT well within 10 seconds I had started to unpack. Another reviewer complained about the curtains not closing but if they had looked behind the sheers they would have seen the thick blackout shades which pull across and block out all the light. The windows have double pane glass so if you are up higher it is silent from street noise and that's something for manhatten. If I were paying the regular rate of up to 300 dollars a night then I would expect a fridge in the room and free internet but for the price I could live without.

The hotel was booked via Expedia. We found this hotel to be absolutely the worst value for the top dollars they are charging. I have found better service at 1 star motels charging $ 40/night than this place.This was the worst hotel experience we ever had in our life with some of the following issues : - Overflowing toilet : On our last day in the morning, the toilet started overflowing with dirty water spilling all over the bathroom floor. Despite repeated calls, nobody showed up at the room for almost 40 minutes. After 40 minutes, the plumber who showed up simply plunged the toilet but nobody came to clean the bathroom. Finally, the house cleaning showed up after another 30 minutes but did not carry any cleaning supplies. Since we had to catch the flight we simply had to pack up and leave the room without stepping into the bathroom. While I can understand that plumbing can malfunction, the management's response was absolutely pathetic. Manager and front desks simply did not want to deal with the situation in spite of repeated calls. - The hotel has benches between the lobby and guest elevator. We found that people were simply sleeping on these benches during the day and we had to pass them while going to our rooms. The people who were sleeping were NOT tourists or hotel guests but looked like homeless people from street who simply wanted to rest on a nice benches. It was evident that nobody from the hotel management was bothered about these sleeping people. We are paying top dollars for staying at a good place but the area looked more like an old Greyhound station. - When we checked in, the receptionist simply told us that there are no non-smoking rooms available. When I explained that they need to figure out how to provide me a room, the receptionist simply went inside and came back and gave us a non-smoking room. It was clear to me that the hotel had non-smoking rooms but the receptionist simply wanted to dump a smoking room on us. While the location for the hotel is good, the place has too many problems- non responsive management, lack of customer service, very small rooms. Please avoid this dump in NY at any cost. It simply not worth it- especially with the price you are paying.

If you're travelling to the airport, my only tip would be check with the cars outside the hotel before getting the concierge to book the shuttle bus, which is much more expensive if there are a few in your party.

When we arrived we noticed that the lobby had been completely redone, very nice, however it did not make up for the a**hole we had to deal with at check-in. We asked if our other family members had arrived and were told that was a security issue and he couldn't tell us. After a long arguement he did call their room and said there was no answer so either they hadn't checked in or they were out. ** We found out later our family had left an important message for us at the desk which we received they day we checked out!** We were told we had to return at 4 pm as our room wouldn't be ready until then but we could leave our bags in the \"secure\" area, however the FEE to do this is $3.75 per bag. I'm thinking with the $200+ per night per room (plus extra for internet) we were paying this was a bit ridiculous. We ended up having to speak to a manager and she put us in a room that was ready (not the original one intenede for us) so everyone with us stored their luggage there. The room smelled bad, the bathroom was moldy, the shower handle was broken, the tub plug didn't work, the sink plug didn't work. The room was tiny and the King bed didn't quite look big enough, The view was the other side of the hotel - brick with windows all around and an empty \"pit\" in the centre. I asked the cleaning staff to please exchange the feather pillows for foam, I was told to ask the front desk, which I did. We were there for 4 nights - I NEVER got a foam pillow (I exchanged one with other family) nothing ever gets fixed and it is very annoying. The only thing that was good was the breakfast, hot and cold choices but expensive at $35 each.

But beware even with a huge long reception desk there is always a long queue, standing in line and having opened ears you hear pretty amazing things and many many complaints by guests. My room was ok, on the 24th floor, fabulous view!!! I wouldn\u2019t exactly call it a birds eye view, If you tilted you head you would see a bit of the upper east side other than that your direct view was another building! The room was known as a large Concierge King a disabled one I might add, large and just renovated. I paid between $300 - $599 as the price was different each day. Some of the lamp sockets were broken which was already known by the technicians and receptionists but yeah the still decided to stick someone in there and plus the shower holder was broken so having a shower in one hand and a soap in the other wasn\u2019t very practical!

There is a business centre so you can email, book and print your own stuff i.e. shows on Broadway! Concierge was also ok; they do their job but charge high prices doing it. The lifts always get stuck so if you are afraid of small spaces maybe its best you should book on a lower floor.

As soon as we got there, we did notice that the scaffolding on the outside was still there but it really didn't obstruct our view of the hotel and if anything, it was nice because it provided some cover from the rain while we were there. The lobby is bright, air-conditioned, and clean and no matter what time of day we came and went it was never crowded. We arrived just after 4pm, and there were a few people ahead of us checking in but we didn't wait more than a minute or two before they opened up another desk to help us. I had booked a Superior room with a King size bed through Expedia because the room with the double beds was going to be an extra $150. I asked if they had any rooms with double beds available and was upgraded at no extra cost, with no hassles. Everyone greeted me by name, and they were extremely friendly and helpful. Now, the elevators, they are a major pain in the butt until you figure out how to work them. There are two bays of elevators at opposite ends of the lobby, one serves the lower floors and the other is for the higher floors. You have to select your floor from the touchpad at ground level, and the computer will dispatch an elevator to you. HOWEVER, that elevator is not necessarily going to be the fastest one. You CANNOT hop into the next available elevator and press the buttons from inside because it will NOT work. You MUST summon the elevator using the touchpad. It is annoying and very slow, but it's better than taking the stairs (which you can't even do because the door is locked at ground level). The room itself was beautiful. Standard size for hotel rooms, and quite large for your typical NY hotel room. We had a large flat screen tv in the room with HD cable. There were no large bath towels in our room when we arrived, but someone came by to check to see how we settled in and they sent up some towels for us immediately. The AC in our room only had one temperature setting - COLD. We turned it off before going to dinner so it was pleasant by the time we went to bed. Not a big deal, it's better than no AC at all. The beds were comfortable, rooms were kept VERY clean. There was always hot water no matter what time of day we showered, which was nice. The drain in the tub was a little sluggish. The water was definitely hottest in the mornings though. The blackout curtains in the room were great to keep out the morning sun for the days when we wanted to sleep in. The room was also amazingly quiet for being on the 4th floor. We didn't have a great view (we could see Hooters and the parking lot next door, that's about it) but who wants to sit in their room and stare out their window all day? We used our in-room safe for our valuables, it is available free of charge. They also have more safes down at the front desk. The safe did get stuck once, inexplicably, and security was a little slow getting back to us but they had it fixed in no time. They were very friendly and apologetic. INTERNET, well, that was a royal pain. It is very expensive ($14.04/day). You can choose between LAN or wireless internet, neither of which are very fast or reliable. I wouldn't recommend paying for the internet, trust me, it's not worth it. You'll spend half your time hitting refresh, and the other half the time screaming at your laptop. There is a business centre available if you need to print or fax anything, but internet there is $0.30/minute with a minimum charge of $5, and printing/copying/faxing is $1/sheet. Not worth it! I didn't use the gym but my brother did, he said it wasn't half bad for a hotel gym, had a few treadmills, elliptical, weight machine, bike, etc. Lastly, our package was supposed to include the buffet breakfast at the hotel restaurant. I believe it was called the Park Cafe? It is right in the lobby. Not very big, so would be very slow at peak times but it opens at 6:30am and goes until 11. We only ate there once, but the food was quite good. Service is slowwww but it was free, so whatever! They did charge the meal to our room ($61!) but when I checked out they reversed the charges for us with a smile and a big apology. Speaking of check-out, in order to speed up the process, they slip a copy of your invoice under your door the morning of your check-out and if everything is in order, you can actually check out using your television. In the menu there is a guest-services link and if you follow the prompts not only can you check on the status of your account throughout your stay, you can quickly and efficiently check out from the comfort of your own room. All in all, the positives outweighed the little negatives and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice place to stay while visiting NYC. Make sure you visit the Carnegie Deli right next door for the best deli sandwiches and cheesecake in the world! Just don't go at peak hours or you'll be waiting in a line that goes all the way down 7th Ave. It's open from 6:30am-4am daily.", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "CT", "Title": "\u201cMy birthday and America's too!\u201d", "Author": "July1Ct", "ReviewID": "UR33928866", "Content": "We arrived early and were able to check in at 1:00!

Please read on before you make any booking with this hotel. Their service is definitely a huge disappointment - right from the moment we booked the hotel room. We booked through their on-line system for non-refundable special rate. The booking went through but they claimed that AMEX payment was declined so they cancelled the booking without first checking with us, and then asked us to give them our credit card details within 48 hours to reinstate the booking. I would have thought any decent hotel would have the courtesy to check with their customers before cancelling the booking? Anyway, we went ahead because it was getting close to the time of our trip and we couldn't be bothered to check out other hotels. The room is a bit old and run down, water pressure from the shower was quite low, but given the special rate we got (USD 162 tax inclusive), we can live with that. High speed internet in room, but at a charge of USD14.99 per day. Storage of luggage at USD 3.75 per piece per day - even for same day pick-up within 2 hours! We stayed in the hotel for one night, left for Canada for 5 days and then return to the hotel - that costs us USD18.75 already! Expensive - but we accepted that's NYC. While we appreciate hotel is after all a money making business, we were truly annoyed when the hotel staff made money by deceit. When we asked for directions to Newark Airport, the front desk staff told us that we can't take yellow cab as the airport is in New Jersey. He said that we MUST book a car to the airport and he can arrange for that. The car hire costs USD$85. We later found out from yellow cab driver that yellow cab can take us there at flat rate of USD65 plus toll of USD8! I can accept that car hire through hotel will be more expensive, but to lie about yellow cab not allowed to go to Newark Airport is absolutely not acceptable. The hotel staff has no integrity and is simply ripping tourists off! As if that's not enough, when we returned from Canada we asked for late check out at 12:30 (normal check out time is 12:00, so we were only asking for 30 mins extension), we were bluntly turned down. Just another 15 mins? \"Absolutely NO, our hotel is FULLY booked!\" So much for their quality service they claim they are offering their guests. Then we asked how much is the approximate charge of yellow cab to JFK terminal, the front desk staff told us that we need to book a car and it would cost USD85. When we returned to our room and checked on the internet, we found out that yellow cab charges a flat rate of USD 45 plus toll of USD5. We tried to call the front desk from our room to cancel the booking. Neither the operator nor the conceirge picked up the phone, it took us 45 minutes to finally get through to the front desk. The lady said their concierge closes at night and therefore no one would pick up! I told her that we want to cancel our car booking, she said she couldn't do that because the bell man would call the driver direct to place the booking. She would need to track down the bell man to cancel the booking. She asked me whether I know the name if the bell man - I told her that we place the booking with front desk not the bell man, how would I know his name???? I ask her to put one of the bell men on the phone so that I can leave a message for the cancellation and she again said she can't as there is only 1 bell man on duty at night. uhhhh???? If there is only 1 bell man on duty - how difficult would that be to track down the bell man who placed the order in less than an hour ago? This is just incredibly illogical?!!!!! Anyway, I told her to leave a message to the bell man to cancel the booking. When we left the hotel the next day and tried to get a yellow cab, a bell man asked us where we are going and we told him JFK. He asked whether we have booked a car, we said we did but we had cancelled the booking the night before. He said the car had arrived and he offered to cut the price from USD85 to USD 55 right away ( I guess the $30 is how much he or the hotel made out of our booking!) I insisted on taking yellow cab and the bell man started to yell at the cab driver for taking away his business, and then came the bodily contact! Another incredible demonstration of their service - bell man picking a fight with cab driver right in the face of a hotel guest!!!! Several other cab drivers stopped by to offer support to my cab driver. The bell man continued to yell and scream as our cab pulled away from the hotel. Our stay in the hotel was a terrible experience - worst that I ever had! We have black-listed this hotel and will never go back again. Recommend a friend to stay there? NEVER!!!!!!!!!!!

We got a really good rate on the hotel so I was expecting a pretty small, somewhat dingy hotel (as we had stayed at a 1/2 star lower hotel a year ago and it was small and dingy). It actually turned out to be a very nice hotel w/a beautiful lobby, okay excercise room and very clean rooms. The photos make the rooms look old, but actually it's more modern looking in real life. The room was not super big, but there was a king size bed, 2 chairs, a desk and flat screen tv and we didn't feel overcrowded... plus, this is NY and if you've ever seen most people's apartments in NY, you wouldn't think this was that small. The location is great, I used to work a block away and this is centrally located. W/in blocks are Central Park south, Carnegie Hall, the Time Warner building, Times Square, 5th Ave shopping. 2 downsides: no in room fridge, it's $25 to rent a crib, they charge by the hour to hold your bags. Carnegie Deli is right next door, famous for it's delicous, huge deli sandwiches. Yes, the sandwiches are $15, but the portions are huge. Btw, we walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and ate at Grimaldi's Pizza, it's the best pizza you can get. Totally worth the trip to Brooklyn. Instead of spending $40 from JFK to the city ($70 from the city to JFK, yes it's higher going to the airport), I would recommend taking the AirTran from Penn Station. It's easy and so much cheaper.

We had a bit of trouble operating the safe but we rang reception about this and within minutes a very nice and helpful secruity gaurd arrived at sorted us out. The room was a brilliant size. The beds were a nice size and comfotable. There was a nice size closet with the safe (which you dont have to pay to use like some hotels in Europe). The bathroom was also a good size. The room was extremely clean and I have high standards. We had no problem with the lifts never waited more than a few minutes which i think is more than understandable for a hotel with 20 odd floors. All the staff we spoke to were very friendly and helpful. We spoke to a few of the housekeeping staff who were friendly and liked chatting to us. The hotel is in the best location possible. Most tourist destinations are either a short walk or a subway ride away. There are subway stations located close to the hotel depending on where you want to go. Times Square is about 10 minutes slow walk right out of the hotel. Broadway is behind the hotel. Fifth Avenue is just a 10-15 min walk. As is Rockerfeller Centre which by the way is a big must. Get the sunrise and sunset ticket for just $10 more than a normal day ticket it is well worth it. You get the most amazing views of manhattan. And you have two days to use the sunset ticket. It was the best thing we did. We heard from other tourists that the view from Rockerfeller is better than Empire state and much less busy. There are so many places to eat around the hotel although the closer you are to Times Square the more expensive it is.Apparently there are some great places to eat along 9th Avenue although we didnt eat there. We found a great deli to the left of the hotel (opposite Carnegie Hall) on the last day. It was much cheaper and had better produce than the ones further right of the hotel.

I booked our rooms online through the hotel website with the early bird special ..which included breakfast for 149.00 per night. Wow...what a deal...last year we paid 300.00 a night along Time Square. When we first arrived, they gave us a room on the fourth floor. We told the African American gentleman that we wanted double beds instead of the super king that was reserved and that we would like to check the room. We went up and the room stunk and looked well used....so we immediately went back down and told a nice young lady that it was not going to work. Then we had room 1508 which had a view of the lights on Time Square. We thought OK ..this will work. The first night my husband wanted to hook up to the internet and the in room wire connection would not work. We were afraid to do anything online with the wifi. Also, the air conditioner/heater unit did not work...and the lamp on the desk did not work....and no fans in the bathrooms. The window, however, did open...but was too noisy at night. We called the next morning to tell them of the electrical problems and that we wanted another room. She told us to check back with them at 4:00 pm to see what rooms were available. She wanted us to check our bags in at the desk but I told her that we would just leave everything by the closet door. We went down to eat breakfast and it was scrumptious!!! It made up for any problems that we may have had. An American Breakfast Buffet with Fruit!!!! We got back at 6:00 pm and the same lady gave us room number 1602 (a large handicapped room). It was very clean and quiet. It seemed the higher that we went the better it got. We did not have a view in room 1602 but it did not matter...because it was so clean and quiet. I would give the hotel 5 stars....if we did not have to go through the first night and the fourth floor dump. I will have to say this...when we went to check the room on the 4th floor...we waited forever... for the elevator...I went downstairs ....while my spouse...waited...by the time that I went to the desk...changed keys...I noticed no spousey...so I hit the 4th floor button.

Back to the lobby we went; we were told the hotel was full, sorry for the confusion, and were given a regular King room on the 10th floor and had a view of a brick wall. Oh well. Our room was clean, the bed comfortable, the housekeeping staff very nice. Our room was in need of a some maintenance; the hairdryer was off the wall, one outlet was off the wall, one of the lamps was really hard to turn on and off, and the clock radio didn't work at all. Cosmetic things, mostly, but a little disappointing that they would be left like that. Considering I got the room for $118 US/night and it included a full buffet breakfast for both of us (which we really enjoyed), I think it was worth it. The location is excellent; Times Square is just a few blocks away (walk within 10 minutes), you can see Central Park from the front of the hotel, and Seventh Avenue is quite lively in the evening. We felt quite safe the entire time. A subway stop is right by the hotel. I can usually overlook the little things, like broken clocks; however, no matter how nice the hotel or good the deal is, when I feel as though I have not received what I booked and/or paid for, it makes it hard to give the hotel a great rating.", "Date": "March 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "scunthorpe", "Title": "\u201cenjoyed every minute of stay\u201d", "Author": "ScunthorpePhil", "ReviewID": "UR25827875", "Content": "enjoyed every minute of my four day stay.the hotel was clean ,service excellent,staff very friendly and helpful.the hotel is ideally situated for Times Suare,broadway and central park.close by are shops and dining establishments.Many other points of interest were in easy walking distance.A good all round location.There was no noise disturbance in room.phil &Lorna ,Scunthorpe,UK", "Date": "March 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new brunswick", "Title": "\u201cThrough the snow to an amazing vacation.\u201d", "Author": "travelingwhilbury", "ReviewID": "UR25802467", "Content": "I'm not going to spend much time elaborating on the location of the Park Central.

The shampoo arrived on the 3rd day, after we'd bought some) and the hairdryer is very dated and cuts out when it gets hot, so bring your own.

The breakfast was expensive so we avoided it, but we ate there one evening and opted for their set menu for the night which was a lot cheaper than chosing from the menu. We had steak for the main course which was the best steak we've eaten, especially as it would have been the cheap cut.

We did not have a remote though and couldn't be bothered enquiring about one. Everything seemed clean (except for the pair of undies under the bed) and the bed was so soft - better than home. The bathroom was functional, but the staff seemed to have trouble replacing the shower products, as we ended up woth 4 body lotions, so I suggest taking your own. There is an ice machine on each floor (no fridge in room) and a drinks vendor, but wasn't working. The elevators here are terrible, out of the 4 available maybe 2 were working. Sometimes it could take 5 minutes to get one from your floor. From the lobby they have a silly system whereby you press your floor and get told which one to go to - ignore this and just get in the next one available. The bar/restaurant attached is expensive ($9 for a bottle of Bud) and the bar makes final call at midnight. The concierge office was quite helpful for us. This hotel is all about price and location. we originally booked about August 08 for about $135 a night, but realising a week before we left the price was only $100, we cancelled (allowable free up until day before) and rebooked at the new price - a saving of about $200. I think I overheard the price if you were to show up on the day was still only $109. Dont forget to add all the taxes to these prices (and for NY accomodation there are a lot). The location is on 7th between 55th and 56th Streets. Upon leaving the front door - looking right you can see the ball they drop in times square on New Years Eve on 43rd St, and looking left 3 blocks away is Central Park where the horse and carriage rides go from (The south end is close to the ice skating too). Across the road is Carnegie Hall and on the next block is the \"worlds best\" Carnegie Deli where many famous people are pictured and they sell a club sandwich with a pound of meat for about $22. We would have gone but the queue was always very long when we were in the area. The closest subway station is next door, but if you walk 2 blocks south to 53rd St the E line subway goes towards JFK airport (change at the stop before Jamaica and follow signs for Airtrain). The Airtrain is $5 and the subway $2 - takes just over an hour and very cheap. If you have heavy luggage there are stairs at 53rd st station though. There is also a stop for the Citysights Hop on/off bus 2 blocks north which we did, and other local buses I assume.

I was very angry at this...why would I want twin beds when we are on a romantic weekend!?! The member of staff said room type is never guaranteed and therefore we will have to have a twin. I was not having any of it, and pointed out we had booked a double and we would not accept a twin under any circumstances... After much huffing from the member of staff he said he would get a double room cleaned and that we would have to wait two hours or a room. I'd like to point out that we were checking in at 7pm! He said we could leave our bags but it would be $3.50 for the two bags. We did this reluctantly and went for a quick look around Times Square which is literally 5 minutes walk from the hotel. Went back to the hotel at 9pm and was checked into our double room with no aggravation.

JFK to Manhattan is a flat fare $45 plus tolls (~$55 including tip) The trip back to JFK is metered not a flat fare so the chances of the meter ticking over while we sat in NYC traffic would add to the cost.

We were early, and she told us a room was ready. About 10 seconds later, she said that one of her fellow clerks had just booked it, so it wasn't. ...OK. Strangely disorganized. Then, she said she could check us in early. I asked how that would help (as in, if the room wasn't ready, what would it matter? simply curious, not rude at all) and she barked, \"I'm TRYING to help you!\" She then insisted that I remove my ID from my wallet, though I was struggling to get it out, because she HAD to have it on the desk next to her rather than look at it through the plastic window. Doesn't seem like a big deal, but I've stayed at a lot of hotels, and it was odd. We were guests, and she treated us like our presence was a massive inconvenience. A woman we spoke to later, whose name I didn't get, also needed to see ID but didn't seem to care that it was in my wallet. We went to drop off our bags since we were going out for the afternoon and the room wasn't ready, and were told we had to pay to have them held, though we were guests at the hotel. As my husband said ... it's just \"chintzy.\" It just seems like they go out of their way to nickel-and-dime the guests. The room was fine. No coffee maker, tiny shower, no extra blankets, etc. Completely bare-bones. The elevators creaked - loudly - all day and night. Also, as other reviewers have stated, a 10-minute wait for them is more common than not. When I entered the hotel one day, someone was stuck in the elevator and maintenance was trying to get her out. A few other things. As we were waiting for the elevator (as usual), two employees were arguing loudly right next to us. Just very unprofessional in front of paying guests. The soda machine didn't work. Many of these things wouldn't be a big deal on their own, but combined, they just left a bad taste in our mouths.

The purpose of the trip was to celebrate a friends birthday. 10 couples stayed at PCNY. After reading some reviews I was nervous. the planning phase of the trip was rocky as the rates we were quoted changed 3 times.The second time we never received a confirmation so we had to rebook...at another rate. The service during the booking phase was far below par for any hotel. When we checked in we were told that we had 2 seperate reservations....both at different rates. We took the cheaper one and the guy behind the counter was nice about it. The room itself was small but cozy. Bedding was good and the maid service was prompt. The location of the hotel is its best feature. The mid town address is really close to everything. It was always easy to get a cab and there are great places to eat very close to the hotel. There is also a Duane Reed (SP??) Drug store about a block away so we stocked up on Diet Coke and water at the store rather than pay $6 for a diet coke in the restaurant. Our floor did have a vending machine but it did not work. My stay was pleasant but I did see some things that I must warn about. First off...the waitress in the bar was horribly rude. apparently you cannot take a cup of coffe or a bottle of water into the bar area or she will be fired...or so she said in a sharp tone. The concierge was less than friendly but it think she was over worked. One day I left the hotel at 8 am and she gave me quick directions. When I returned that evening around 6 she was still working. This hotel looked like it was popular with large groups. The groups really kept the concierge very busy. Fortunately we traveled with people who were familiar with the city so we did not really need the concierge services. If you will need Concierge services be VERY aware that this may become an issue for you. The elevator comments you may have read are factual. The room temprature comments are factual...but we found the outdated AC/Heating system was OK to control. And last...our room 2027 had no view but it was VERY quiet. We were happy with this trade off. Overall I would give this place a 6.5 out of 10. I would stay here again for what we paid...which was $169/night the first time we booked...then it went to $98 per night...and the final price was about $112 per night.

Park Central seemed to be a perfect match to my needs, and with an advertised online price of $99, how could you not love that, right? I had read reviews on Hotels.com and although some thought that the rooms were a bit small, everyone reviewing kept raving about the location, and the value for the price. Well, none of that matters when the reservation you've made is not honored. Upon arriving at the front desk around 2pm on a Friday afternoon, the front desk clerk asked me to step out of line and walked me down the hallway to the manager's desk where there were two men and a woman waiting in front of me. What we were all being told is that there was a problem with the hotel's website when the reservation was made and that the hotel was oversold by 80 rooms. They had made arrangements for us at another hotel in the city (The Carlton on Madison Avenue - a BEAUTIFUL hotel, but certainly NOT anywhere near the locations listed above that were central to our trip), but after parking in a garage next to Park Central, the hotel only offered us $20 to get our vehicle out of the garage and NO transportation to The Carlton. The attitude of the employees of Park Central seemed to indicate that this was not out of the ordinary for this hotel, and although apologies were offered for our inconvenience, I think you can understand how disappointed we were to not be staying where we had a reservation, but also to not be notified that there was a problem BEFORE our arrival. The hotel had both my cell phone number and Email address and no attempt to contact me prior to my arrival had been made. I would gladly have driven to The Carlton instead, but to park in a garage in Manhattan and only be offered the $20 to get the car out (what we would have been charged for our half hour at the garage) is completely unacceptable. I wish I could give you details about the room as Park Central looked to be an older yet beautiful hotel, but we never got to see the room. When you're staying at a better hotel while on a trip for pleasure, I think that the hotel's service is every bit as important as its physical attrbutes, but when a hotel can't live up to its end of the bargain, the very least a hotel can do is to own up to its mistake, Park Central failed to do this.", "Date": "January 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cPark Central - A Good Stay\u201d", "Author": "PosseSF", "ReviewID": "UR23168904", "Content": "My buddy & I spent 6 hrs. @ our local coffee house reviewing hotels on various sites for our trip to NYC. My friend & I booked a 6-day stay (12/17-12/22) at the Park Central; many reviews were great, other were hate, but we'd give it a shot. We arrived, we're greeted by Saleem, a friendly counter clerk. He was fast, polite & answered all our questions. We got to our room (#1029), (2) double-beds, facing the dreaded center core of the bldg. (no view which is often the norm in NY from what I'm told) & the faceplate on the closet safe had been torn off; so couldn't use the safe, which we needed. I called & spoke to a rep, requesting another room due to the safe issue; she said there weren't any. My friend called & spoke to a man who understood the problem, he patched us thru to Customer Manager. My friend explained having to use the Concierge safe was impractical. The CM said they did have another room; come down to the desk. We did & Wa-lah, Saleem had us in another room (#1119) in a New York minute. We get to our new room; again double beds, slightly larger with a view of the city, a fridge & a safe that worked. We discovered the TV did not work. We called & in 5 minutes a maintenance rep showed up & fixed the problem in a jiffy; back plug was out of the set. Each day our room was cleaned & all our questions were answered by the staff. They were all polite to us. I needed to print some itinerary stuff & they promptly directed us to the Business Center. We'd leave our room and the housekeepers were all smiles and wished a good day. The one draw back is the new elevator system; you enter your floor on a keypad & it assigns an elevator. One problem, it doesn't ask the # in your party, so as folks arrive to the elevators, everyone is assigned the same one. You'd have 20 folks to one elevator which doesn't work out well. We had one overloaded and it ground it's way to the lobby. They are still working the kinks on this. As we reached the lobby one morning, there were some suits standing & chatting; turns out the elevator company. Having experience in Risk Management I later contacted the hotel on my return home and spoke to the manager who works with the elevator service. I identified some flaws in the system; that while it was great to push your floor and be assigned a particular car, everyone was being assigned the same car, out of 4 elevators. Additionally, the same keypad is out in the front lobby, allowing bored kids to push buttons, or adults to push their floor, but then be side tracked and not use the elevator. Once a floor is picked on the keypad, it automatically lights up the button in the elevator. So, if many folks don't show up, the remaining passengers are left to stop on floors where no one is getting off. Since the system doesn't ask for # of passengers in your group, the Hotel is overloading the elevator. From a Risk Management point of view, were they prepared to be sued when one elevator, being overweight, snaps free or just shuts down trapping folks. You could hear a pin drop. The rep actually heard what I said, took notes and asked if it was okay to contact me for follow up questions or thoughts. Hey, sure, why not. The Park Central is not the Ritz Carlton, which I have stayed in other cities, even here in SF, and was not impressed. Now, the InterContinental impresses me anytime. But anyway, The Park Central is and older hotel, but I found it clean, remodeled on our floors, the Business Center, Gym area and others. The lobby was nice and truly everyone was pleasant to us and accommodated us quickly. Don't eat at the hotel restaurant; THE LINE IS JUST TOO LONG FOR AVERAGE FOOD. Go over to the Brooklyn Diner or Europa down the block, great food and good prices. Another tip I tell all; TIP YOUR HOUSEKEEPER DAILY. Don't assume you have the same housekeeper each day. Many folks tip the last day or when they pay. You're assuming the HK getting all the tip on the last day will share or even if that HK was the one that cleaned your room all week. Plus you assume the Hotel will pass the money along to housekeeping. I was given this tip years ago and it has resulted in; returning in the evening with the bed turned down and chocolates on my pillow, larger towels, a bath robe, better toiletries, extra blanket, flowers on the table, and my belongings always stayed put. I even once found my dirty clothes laundered. This trip, we tipped each day, and we'd return to Thank You notes, wishing us well, thanking us for our generosity & with God Bless, and we got newer larger bath towels (though not necessary as we opted for the clean choice; same linens for stay to reduce water use) These folks don't get paid well and they do a lot, so return the favor and ensure your HK get's their tip.

The breakfast was in their cafe and had a variety of food but they \"accidentially\" charged me for my breakfast because they had a \"glitch\" in their computer. Their buffet breakfast charge was $61 for 2 people! Unbelievable! They then wanted to charge me $5 to print out my reservation on their computer as my proof of the free breakfast. I refused and they were able to \"waive\" the charge. I usually don't check out because of the lines at the front desk but this time I did via the phone and went down to the desk to get my receipt and there was the charge for breakfast again!

However, upon checking the HOTEL'S OWN WEBSITE, it appeared there were many rooms available. I booked directly online and then went back to the front desk with the reservation and asked to keep the same room. They did not apologize for the mistake and it took a long 10 minutes of persuasion just to be able to keep the same room. Clearly, this hotel has some major organizational and service problems. Secondly, the power went out during the last day of my stay and the staff was quite rude and unhelpful about resolving or explaining the problem. They were strict on check out times despite the fact that it was impossible to see or take a hot shower. Finally, I have never been allergic to anything but after staying a few nights in this hotel, I had to go the emergency room because of a severe allergic reaction caused by something I came in contact with in this hotel, the doctor said it was most likely dust mites.

We did pay a high enough price for staying a week, but we had looked around a bit and most others seemed to be along the same price and i would have rathered stay somewhere a friend had recommended and get somewhere decent. When we arrived we checked in no problem. The original room we were put in was slightly cramped but nicely furnished and most importantly it was clean. There was a slight glitch as the air conditioning was broken, but we phoned the front desk and they immediately gave us the room next door, which was a lot more spacious but had the same amount of furniture in it, just a different layout. Both the rooms and bathrooms were clean and we never had any problems with how the housekeeping was done. The only problem we encountered during our stay was with they key card for the room. On 3 seperate occasions they key stopped working. The second time it happened i was advised this was because of the fact that i kept it in the same bag as my cell phone and credit card, which i found hard to believe considering most people staying in NYC are going to be carrying either both or one or the other, and also this had never happened in any other hotel ive stayed in! Also, on the third occasion it stopped working we had kept the key in the bottom of a suitcase while we went on an overnight trip, so it hadnt been near either a phone or a credit card! Apart from this minor problem i would certainly recommend the hotel. From other reviews maybe it is a bit hit and miss, but if you are on a sightseeing holiday (i have no idea for business trips!) i think its a great place to stay.

Then an internal lobby with writing desk, leading to the enormous bedroom, with windows on 2 sides, and marvellous views of the surrounding skyscrapers. Another TV in here for watching in bed. Finally, the bathroom, which was really very nice. It obviously wasn't especially new, but it was in excellent condition, with clean grouting, nice marble surfaces, and a big bathtub / shower over, with plenty of fluffy towels. The aircon worked well - I blasted it during the day to keep the room cool, then turned it down at night as it was quite noisy. The windows were double glazed, and kept out almost all the traffic noise - you would never know you were in central NY, it's the first hotel in NY I've ever slept in and not needed earplugs. We did have breakfast in the hotel one day - it was nice, with plenty of variety, but the cost was extortionate. I'd recommend going just down the road for pancakes and eggs instead. Check out was also slow, as you have to nip in between the big groups, but again, the staff were friendly and helpful. My only niggle was with the lifts - they were quite slow, and there didn't quite seem to be enough of them, so it was a few minutes wait around breakfast time to go up and down. But this was a minor issue, and I thought the rest of the hotel was fine. It isn't perhaps as nice as some other nearby hotels, but it was much cheaper, and to be honest, I prefer that. For the price we paid, I'd definitely use it again, because the location is superb.", "Date": "September 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "moveleft", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, TERRIBLE hotel\u201d", "Author": "moveleft", "ReviewID": "UR20386834", "Content": "I recently stayed here for four nights while on a business trip to NYC. When you have to wait almost a half hour to check into a Manhattan hotel at 11:30 PM, you know you're not in for a great stay. I am convinced that those who gave this hotel positive reviews either have very low standards or have never stayed anywhere else in NYC. First, the place is no bargain. When room rates start north of $400/night, I expect better than a 30 minute wait, outwardly surly front desk staff and a claim that the room type I selected (and they confirmed, with a late check in guarantee) was no longer available. After refusing to accept a lesser room (without a reduction in the room rate), the manager (who I requested complete my check-in after the shoddy service from the clerk) suddenly \"found\" the proper room type for me. Of course, it really didn't matter. While the rooms are a bit larger than the norm for NYC, they are spartan, poorly decorated and not in any way set up for business travel. There are no amenities to speak of, terrible bedding, rough towels and an all around \"rough around the edges\" feel to all the furnishings. The housekeeping staff could use a refresher course in the fine art of housekeeping. The outdated AC units rattle all night and the curtains never quite close enough to shut out the morning light. Hotel staff runs the gamut from incompetent to indifferent to outright rude. If you need internet access, head to the Starbucks on the corner. The \"wi-fi\" is so slow that it made me long for the days of dial up...yes, it was that bad. While the location is great, there is nothing about this hotel worth the price.

We were quite impressed when we walked into the hotel lobby, but were quickly unimpressed by the front desk guy who acted as though we were bothering him by checking in. out of about 4 front desk workers i spoke to over the duration of our stay, 1 was pleasant. The room did not have a coffee maker or anything extra to make the stay more welcoming. just shampoo and soap, not even a shower cap. but that isn't a big deal, but when you pay $400/night, you think you'd be getting the best of the best..but i guess it is New York after all and it is waaay more expensive. What was a big deal, was our first day of housekeeping, someone went into my suitcase and stole my favorite skirt! i didn't notice until the next morning when i went in to get dressed for the day and realized it was gone. We searched every inch of the room for it. We contacted security who was really friendly and said that this does happen. I had my suitcase closed, but not zipped...so be sure to zip and lock it! i've traveled all over the world and stayed at all levels of hotels and never experienced this. we kept the room locked and security ensured that no one would enter our room without a supervisor. we asked that we not have our room serviced again. well the next day not one, but two people tried to enter our room while we were in there! I told front desk who didn't seem to care. In the end all we got was $100 off our $400/night room for a \"guest complaint\". they wouldn't even comp the one movie we rented on the tv. terrible! barely covers the cost of the item that was stolen. i'm just glad more wasn't taken from me or my mom. On a positive note...Conceirge was AWESOME!!! which we later found out were not employees of the hotel, but a hired company placed in the hotel. they were FANTASTIC!! best service ever! heck i'd go to the hotel just for info! definitely not to stay. Room service was crazy expensive. so we never ate at the hotel so i can't judge the food, but it must be good for that price!

Wasnt until after booking it that i read the reviews and started to worry, it really isnt written up as a great place on here. Boy was i to be surprised! We arrived at 1930 on a thursday evening, walked straight up to the front desk, no Q's and checked in. This took less than 3 minutes. Then we were pointed in the direction of the lifts, and within 4 more mins we were in our room, number 738. The lifts had signs up saying apologies for delays but they are renovating them, and i have to say, we didnt wait once for a lift, pushed the button and one arrived pretty much straight away. We soon found that there are a couple of elevator shafts in this hotel and if you have your back to the reception desk, then take the corridoor on the left and follow it round, that lift section is really quick. The room itself was a quad room, 2 large double beds, a bathroom and a huge cupboard. the bathroom was big, a full size bath, big sink and a toilet. It was cleaned daily, as the bath took a little while to drain when having a shower, (approx 3 mins after getting out and tunring the water flow off) and fresh towels put in the room each day, altho they do ask you to reuse them, but if you dont want to, just leave them in a heap and they get changed daily. The comlpimentary toiletries were replenished each day too. There were 2 plug sockets in the bathroom and a hairdryer. Be warned with the hairdryer, if you have anything longer than eye level it will take a while to dry it with this. Mine is shoulder length and very thick, but with the humidity out there it frizzed very quick anyhow, so only used it to dry off the excess water! So nothing wrong with the bathroom. Enter the bedroom. There are no ceiling lights, only stand alone ones, 2 taller ones and 2 table top ones on the bed side table. These created plenty of light. There is a closet in the bedrooms, and to describe the amount of space, i would say you could easily get approx 15 fully grown adults in it! It was huge. As there were 4 of us sharing a room, i actually used it to get changed when the bathroom was being used, and i had more than enough room! There was an ironing board and iron in it, a safe, and two hanging rails with hangers. There were also spare blankets and pillows in there. Perfect. There was a large flat screen tv in our room, and it had a lot of channels, we had no probs finding anything to watch!! There is an ice bucket and glasses on the desk too next to the tv, but no kettle or tea/coffee/biscuits in the room. If you are there on business, there is also another table with chairs there you can use. The air con, a lot of people on here have complained about it, i really dont see why. We were in NYC while outside temps were in the late 30's, and we put it on high while out during the day and when we came in, it was nice and cool, we turned it down a bit while in the room as it became a bit nippy and if you are in the bed next to it, can be a bit blowy! (but as i wasnt in that bed, it really didnt bother me at all!!) The unit itself was located under the window, and certainly done waht it was there to do, cooled the room right down, so no complaints at all about it from me. The beds. they were lovely. The pillows so comfy, i slept nearly as good as i do in my own bed, and if it hadnt been for the other 3 in the room snoring, id have slept better! The sheets were changed every 2 days, and were all lovely and clean, there was a small burn mark, but nothing to complain about as i know that those sheets are done in bulk and can burn slightly when dried if not done properly, and the throw they put over the bed covered it anyway! You cant get under the bed, so im not sure how people have said that they are disgusting, and to be honest, why would you want to look undera bed in a hotel??? It also appeared to be hoovered every day, i didnt once find crumbs or mess on the floor. After all the previous reviews on here, i can understand why someone would be so worried about it, but dont be, this hotel is perfect, and for the price, i was so impressed, i even tipped the maid!!! The staff in the hotel were very kind, we only really interacted with them 3 times. Arrival, which the lady was very pleasant, then to check check out time (12pm, but we managed 1pm at no extra cost) and to actually check out. All the staff we saw were very nice. Our homeward flight wasn't until 2135 on a tuesday evening, so as we had managed to secure a 1pm check out for free, we then stored our bags in their luggage store at $3.50 per bag. The hotel arranged a taxy to take us to JFK later that night and that cost us $65 with a $20 tip on top, which i didnt think too bad as there were 4 of us, and on previous visits to NYC, had paid over $80 in a yellow cab to get to the airport! If you want a late check out, between 12pm and 3pm is a $75 charge and any time after 3pm they charge you a whole days rate, which i think is a little excessive, but thankfully we didnt use it! The lobby of the hotel was very clean and tidy, we sat there for a couple of hours before our flight as we were so tired and worn right out from a very action packed holiday and no one asked us to move or questioned us. There are comfy sofas to sit on and a shop if you want anything. Can not fault this hotel at all, loved it. Please dont worry about staying here, its all you could want and more. We didnt use the internet service, or either of the 2 restaurants that are in it, but they all looked and sounded great! We ate a a few of the nearby delis and cafes. Cafe metro is great for a quick brekkie, and the deli on the corner by the hotel does really good cooked food and lots of little snacks and drinks that you can take back to your room. There is a subway opposite the hotel and a christmas shop! Central park is 3 blocks away, and times square is a 5 minute walk away, you can see it from outside the hotel! There are always taxis waiting outside if you need them, and concierge is there to help at all hours, with special deals on theatre tickets! Would i stay here again, definately, and i would really look forward to it! Any questions, please dont hesitate to ask, but if you have any doubts about this hotel, them put them aside, im a fussy person, and i cant fault it in any way shape or form.

The fitness center got raves from my wife for being clean and equipped with new machines. Personally, I never made it down to the fitness center, but did walk over to the Park for some very pleasant early-morning jogs. I booked through the hotel's website and got a discount for staying more than 3 nights, which made the average rate very competitive.

I'll be honest after reading the latest reviews about this hotel I was TERRIFIED to stay at Park Central. I even looked into changing hotels the day before we left. Ultimately, I am glad that I didn't spend more money to stay somewhere else. We have stayed in NYC several times all in different hotels. We have stayed in one that was worse and stayed in better. I am a bargain vacation planner and I got a good deal on this hotel through Travelocity. If I had to do it again I'd probably try to find somewhere else for a similar price **only if** the location was as good as Park Central. This hotel is average. Our room wasn't as bad as some of the other reviews but it wasn't amazing either. The upside is that it really is in a GREAT location. If you go to NYC to spend time in the hotel I suggest staying somewhere else. If you want to go to NYC to be out and about in the city then this might be the place for you. The room provides an OK bed and decent size bathroom and room. Apparently, we were lucky and didn't have trouble with the elevators or maid service. The hotel served its purpose for our trip: somewhere to sleep, shower and get ready. I never felt uncomfortable or unsafe. If you can get this hotel for a good price I'd say go for it...if not then try to find another hotel. We had good luck w/ the staff as well. We only had one employee that was rude to us. She was at the concierge desk and got VERY SNIPPY when I asked about tours at Ground Zero. It obviously hit a nerve with her. Her response was offensive to us because the 9/11 attacks effected all of us not just New Yorkers. She told me there are \"no tours and nothing to see there\" she told us that it was \"just a construction site\". I thought it was disgraceful for her to say that because that site will never be 'just a construction site\". FYI: There are walking tours provided through the 9/11 museum called \"Tribute\" .

I would like to let you know why..... We arrived earlier than anticipated and bell hops were outside ready to help with luggage, but without any small bills to tip, we declined, no probs, we were not hassled. The entrance foyer and lounge was spotless and smelled so good! - over the weeks holiday we realised they must have had some kind of aroma pumped through the air con. The air con worked fine. Yes the staff were a bit frosty, but this isn't Disneyland, its a busy hotel, they were polite and professional, just didn't have wall to wall grins, but thats ok. The downside was the 4 pm check in, but we knew that in advance, and they have a secure area for luggage so fine, we went out! We booked two rooms with twin doubles for our family, we have two 16 year old boys, and the rooms were spotlessly clean, fresh towels, modern, full air con and a safe. No probs. Beds made, bathrooms cleaned every day. The rooms were a good size and great TV channels too. The bathrooms were also a good size and stock contantly stocked up daily. Yes, the 4 lifts only have two working in each bank of 4, and the strange thing is that the apology sign is screwed to the wall...a bit permanent we thought, but don't let this spoil your holiday. We took the stairs down and the lifts up, just you wait a bit longer sometimes. Not as long as the hour..oh yes...an hour, just to go down in the lift from the top of the Empire State! so the hotel we got used to, far less a wait I can tell you. We asked for a fan for our boys room and within 30 minutes we had it. The drinks machine took my money and no coke, within 15 minutes a drink was delivered to me to replace it. The hotel is in a brilliant spot, near to subway, cabs, central park, etc., but thank the lord a walking distance away from the noisy and smelly Times Square. Stay here and don't let slow lifts ruin your holiday. We had a fantastic time and would definately book this hotel again, it was good value for money. You want 5 star? book it and pay the price. Any problem we had or query was quickly answered and found the staff helpful. The security staff there are fantastic, all the staff very smart and professional. If you don't like your room, tell them and they will do everything to move you if they can, we know, we saw it happen. This is a good hotel. Their website does not do them justice, search the net and find other photos and reviews, its a big hotel, with a nice modern interior. Many we passed in NY made us glad we had booked at this hotel.

This is usaully not me as I am only interested in the consensus which appeared to be, on the whole it was a good hotel. Here is my balanced and accurate review of the hotel. As others have commented the location of the hotel is perfect, there is a subway right outside the hotel and from there you can get anywhere. Also, as it is on 7th Ave its easy to get a cab. The hotel is within walking distance of most of the sights i.e. Empire State Building, Rockafella centre and as the name suggests very close to Central Park. It also is located near lots of restaurants, deli's and bars. The reception area is immaculate and very smart looking, wer checked in quickly and fine at 4pm, your room may not be ready before then. The room was perfect in size and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in on my travels. This with the huge flatscreen TV was more than acceptable for what we paid. The bathroom was fine and the maid service was very good too. We were never disturbed by the maids and they were always quick to tidy the room up if we had slept in and gone out later. The a/c was bit old and a bit noisy but really not a big deal as it worked and the room was cool. I did notice the comments about reception staff being rude or 'less than friendly'. Well to be honest people need to get over this and stop being so picky. YES I have been in hotels where the staff are more friendly and YES there was the odd member of staff on the reception who could have been more polite but this is NEW YORK for goodness sake - most people you speak to are very direct and 'to the point' -thats just the way they are in NYC. If they were 'direct' with me I was 'direct' with them. In essence most of the bad comments aimed at reception are clearly down to just two guys who out of a team of 10 people work daily - they just need to cheer up and smile a bit but thats really all there is too it- its no big deal. The rest of the recpetion staff were fine. The hotel is fine, really. Its only a base and a place to shower/sleep for gawd sake and a hotel in NYC and should be nothing more than that in this great city - the less time you spend in your hotel the better- there is too much to see and do to waste time moaning about the hotel. If there was something really bad about this hotel I would have spotted it but I think some people are just too fussy sometimes when writing reviews! The Park Central hotel does have faults if you are picky enough to look for them but if you want a good hotel, thats clean, well positioned and comfortable this place is fine for what you pay. You can pay a lot more if you want the best but whats the point. Again, this hotel is FINE. PS Refuse offers of 'taxi's' from the hotel staff as they are just trying to get you to take an expensive limosine run by the hotel to wherever you want to go. Just insist on a yellow cab and you'll be fine.

We were told several times that it would be fixed soon. I had an IV in my arm, so I went to talk to customer service. They sent a fan up to my room a few hours later. The fan helped a lot, but it still wasn't air-conditioning. The third day we spoke to the manager, who was very polite and being bombarded by several people, including us. I wrote a long letter to her and suggested how they should handle the situation. That night the air was back on. The rest of the stay was great. I don't think it was as dirty as people said. The cleaning ladies were really friendly. They did run out of small towels at times, but there were a lot of people there. We just helped ourselves to the linen closet in the hall and grabbed whatever we needed. A bellhop was also available to take our things upstairs when we got there. He was very friendly also. I didn't encounter anyone being outright rude, but I did feel they should have communicated better right from the start of the air-conditioning problem, and I told them that. After searching for hotels for a long time in NY, you have to expect that you won't get as much for the money as somewhere else. That's just a given. Overall, it was a good experience. The room was a fair size, compared to many others that are incredibly small. I felt the staff was friendly. The restaurant there is way too pricey, as well as the room service. The location is wonderful. It's close to Times Square, but not too close to be uncomfortable with all the noise and crowds. It was so close to Central Park. We also liked that we could walk easily to Columbus Circle where there's a Whole Foods Store in the Time Warner building. We bought some groceries there for lunch to save money. It's also right next to the subway, so it was easy to go anywhere. The only problem is that the city closes some of its entrances on the weekend--that's irritating. The best part was when we checked out. We asked for a later check-out and they let us check out at 3:30 without paying anything extra, probably because of what we had been through with the air-conditioning. They also took off about $400 from our bill. I think when you're faced with a problem in the hotel like that, you need to be persistent, but still controlled. They responded very well to us. In the end, it paid for us to sweat out the three days. The rest of the time was great!

There were several hundred people (performers) in this hotel during this week stay. Some travelers were very fortunate and left for other better hotels in the immediate area. Our groups could not leave due to the number of rooms required to accommodate everyone. The bedroom carpet in the Presidential Suite was soaking wet and was unable to be walked on. After three calls over a four hour period a maintenance worker finally showed-up with a mop instead of a wet-vac. The carpet remained soaked for three days and the smell of wet, soggy & moldy carpet was beginning to become unbearable. Most of the front desk personnel were extremely rude, condescending and belligerent and continually displayed an \"I really don't care\" attitude. \"You want to stay here, then this is the way it's gonna be\" Room service dishes and restaurant catering dishes/trash were left in the room for three days without being removed.

I booked a concierge room with a king size bed from Wednesday, June 11, 2008 - Monday, June 16, 2008. From the pictures on the website, the hotel looked comfortable and clean. When I arrived at the hotel, it seemed hot in the lobby but I figured that it was just me because I had been walking with all of my luggage. When I got to the room, I realized that it wasn't me. The air conditioning was out in the room. The fan was on in the air conditioning unit, but it was blowing out air that was room temperature (which was easily 90 degrees). I spoke with the lady at the front desk about the lack of air conditioning in my room and I asked her if I could be moved. She stated that the air conditioning was out in the entire hotel so it would do no good to be moved. I asked her when the air would be fixed and she said that she had no idea. She went on to say that the air had been out for over a week and they are just taking it day-to-day at this point. The temperature in the hotel was the topic of conversation for every guest that I encountered in the elevators and the lobby. People were checking out of this hotel as quickly as they could. Although I was uncomfortable, I tried to make the best of it and see if I could sleep in the room. Due to the high temperature and the fact that there was absolutely no air circulation, I was not able to fall asleep for hours. I lay in bed most of the night sticking to the sheets, tossing and turning in vain to find a cooler spot. By the next morning, I realized that I was not going to be able to stay in this hotel for 4 more days. So, I checked on the Wellington Hotel across the street. They had air conditioning that worked and the rooms were clean and comfortable and they were over $100 less per night than the rooms at the Park Central New York. So, I checked in at the Wellington on Thursday, June 12, 2008 and checked out from the Park Central New York on the same afternoon. When I told the gentleman at the front desk of the Park Central New York that I was checking out due to the air conditioning, he said that he understood. Then, he told me that the hotel would be charging me for my entire reservation with the exception of Sunday night. My original reservation was for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I was checking out on Thursday afternoon and the gentleman at the front desk actually said the hotel was going to charge me for 4 nights that I was not sleeping in the hotel. I couldn't believe it. I demanded to speak to the hotel manager and stated that I wasn't going to be paying. The gentleman at the front desk went back to speak with his manager and then came back to tell me that the hotel would not charge me for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night. However, they were still going to charge me for Wednesday and Thursday night. I still couldn't believe that they were going to charge me for a night that I had not stayed. Then, I saw the rate that they intended to charge me. They were charging me $400/night. When I had booked the room on the website, I had booked a concierge room. The website has a promotion where you get 20% if you stay for 5 or more nights. The total reservation came to $1,700 for 5 nights. I could not understand how the hotel was now charging me $853 for just 2 nights. I told the gentleman at the front desk that I was not even given a concierge room with a king size bed as I had requested in my reservation because one was not available when I checked in at 7:30 PM on Wednesday night. He went back to speak with his manager about my rate and stated that they would take $100 off of my charge for Thursday night. So, my final bill for staying in this hotel for 1 night in a room that was not air conditioned and did not have a king size bed as reserved and was not a concierge room as reserved was $753. This is complete and total highway robbery. I would also like to mention that the wireless Internet in the room I stayed in was not working and neither were 3 out of the 5 lamps in the room. I would also like to mention that the linens on the beds were stained with what looked like dried blood. There was no bellhop to assist us with our luggage when we checked in either. The elevators were extremely slow, but the hotel has signs up that say that they are renovating the elevators. From the dust on those signs, I would say that they have been up for months. After having such a bad experience with the Park Central New York, I contacted my parents and my sister and her husband who were planning to check into the Park Central New York the next day. I told them to cancel their reservations immediately because the hotel had no air conditioning and because of the horrible service. They cancelled their reservations 24 hours before they arrived, but the Park Central New York still charged them for their entire 2-day reservations. My family is now going through the chargeback process with their banks to have these charges reversed. I would like to mention that I checked into the Wellington Hotel across the street from the Park Central New York hotel on Thursday afternoon. The room there was extremely clean and comfortable, my room was larger, had an Italian marble bathroom, a walk-in closet, an incredible view of Times Square and my total bill for a 4 night stay was only $1,052. It is hard to believe that the Park Central New York would act like they did and charge what they did when there is a better hotel that costs less money directly across the street. Frankly, I'm surprised that the Park Central New York hotel is even still in business. My advice to anyone who is planning on staying at the Park Central New York hotel is to stay at the Hotel Wellington. You'll be much more comfortable there and pay less money for your stay and there is absolutely no difference in the geographic location since the hotels are across the street from each other.

Park Central is central to some of New York City's most famous locations. It is just a few blocks from Times Square, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Ed Sullivan Theatre, Broadway theatres, and Carnegie Hall. In addition, the double-decker sight seeing busses have a pick-up location right outside of the hotel. There is also a subway stop just outside of one of the doors. The area is nice and my husband and I felt completely comfortable walking late at night. The lobby is nice, as are the rooms. The rooms are good sized, by New York City standards, and are tastefully decorated. The bathrooms are plenty big enough. The bad: The elevators are PAINFULLY slow. It seems to be more of a problem when going down than when going up. I have no idea why, but that was our assessment of the situation. HOWEVER, they are supposedly upgrading their elevators and we did see a crew doing what appeared to be some signficant construction. So maybe this situation will rectify itself soon. We were only on the 6th floor, so we often took the stairs down, which really wasn't a big deal. If you plan to use the Internet, plan again. It is expensive, and like the elevators, painfully slow. The ugly, and I mean ugly: When we arrived to the hotel on Saturday, we checked into our room and turned on the air conditoning. When we returned late that night, the room was defintely cooler, but not the frigid cold that you often get when in hotel rooms that are cooled with individual units. We noticed this, but proceeded to bed. When we woke up Sunday, the room felt somewhat cool, but the unit didn't seem to be pumping out cold air. When we returned that night, it was obvious that the air was not working. We called the front desk, who told us that indeed the air was not working and that they were hoping to have the situation resolved soon and asked for our patience. My husband and I understood and dealt with the situation. Needless to say, the next morning, the room was VERY hot, as during our stay New York City was having record heat. We got ready for the day and were confident that all would be resolved when we returned that afternoon in order to freshen up for dinner. No such luck. It was still hot and now humidity was starting to settle in. Again, we inquired and again were told that it was broken, being repaired, but they believed that it would be on when we returned for the evening. We we returned from dinner, still no air. By Tuesday morning when we had only gotten about 2 hours of sleep because of the heat, I demanded that something be done. I talked to a manager named Denis who became loud during our conversation and attracted the attention of others checking in. He told me to call Orbitz and that something would be worked out, but he was pretty rude about it, even though I felt that I was being pretty courteous and polite. We did call Orbitz and they managed to get us $422 refunded, which apparently is the equivalent of 50% off of three nights of our stay. Many people have complained about the staff being rude; however, with the exception of Denis, my husband and I never found this to be the case. We always made it a point to great them by name and ask how they were before starting into our conversation. All in all, because of the location, I would consider staying here again, particulary if I knew that the temperature would be controlled.", "Date": "June 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cPark Central Hotel terrible management\u201d", "Author": "vernette", "ReviewID": "UR16876329", "Content": "The first night we arrived and came back to hotel, room door ajar, radio blaring and showerhead sitting on side of tub.

I eventually gave up and went to a local pub and hooked into someone's wifi. (I think it was called Rumors? Good pub.) The shower drain was too slow and so the shower would fill up with a few inches of water at every shower. So we asked for a new room. They asked we bring all our luggage back downstairs to storage so we could be \"checked out\" before we get checked \"back in\". Well we got the new room 15 minutes later and took all our luggage back up to the same 4th floor. And yes, the shower was still the same problem.

There was no apology, conciliatory gesture, welcome or smile and we were extermely taken aback by her rude manner. We had emailed days days before from England to request a non smoking room with a good view and noone had replied, and we had then called the hotel and been told our rquest had been noted but when we asked the recpetionist she did not seem to recognise this and said we had not been allocated a room and she could not promise anything because rooms were allocated first come first served after 4pm. Adding to the bizarre first impression, the lobby was filled with totally inappropriate techno-pop music relayed at ear splitting volume which did not lend itself to a relaxing environment and created a sense of impersonallity and discomfort. We had to take our luggage to a store room ourselves and had no option but to go out and try to fill time until we could check in.

Around 2.30 pm we were dropping with tiredness so we decided to go back in hope that a room might have come up. We queued for a receptionist for about 10 minutes - people around us were getting very edgy and there was an atmosphere of stress all around. Finally we got to the front and a man told us again we could not check in till 4. We collapsed in the terrible hotel bar balring TV and loud music and an indifferent waiter. Finally at 3pm we asked again if a room had become available and this time were told one had, again with no smile, apology or welcome. When we opened the door to our room on 12th floor we were very relieved as it did turn out to be fine - ok view, quite large, modern style. However the cleanliness was not really up to scratch - the carpet hadn't been vacuumed and there were a few small hairs in the bath. Room service was overpriced even before taxes and extra charges and wifi was slow.

The lifts were really slow and on one occasiona taxi driver purporting to work for the hotel fleeced us into using his cab instead of a yellow taxi, promising it was the same rate, but it turned out to be about 50% more expensive.

It said they emailed all guests after their stay to check they were happy but we are still waiting.

Few min walk to Times square or Central Park, 5th avenue and all the major attractions. The booking desk was very helpful, even booking some restaurants for us and answering our questions and suggesting things to do. There is a Starbucks right next to the hotel and a subway across the road, plenty of other places to eat a few feet from the hotel.

Our room was non-smoking but smelt of smoke as you walked in - not enough to be a problem though unless you had an allergy to cigarette smoke.

We chose the Park Central purely due to its close proximity to our destinations. And while the location DID prove to be perfect, the hotel does have several drawbacks: -> ROOMS are decent size and yes, we also got a lovely view of a brick wall, but hey...it's New York, not Maui! Thought the mattresses were good and we all slept well. We also noticed it got a bit stuffy the last night, but you can always crack a window open for some fresh air. -> SERVICE was not really good at all. We waited forever to check in. We also found the maid service to be poor. The first morning, they did come in, clean up, make the beds and provided new towels. Day two...zip! They emptied the one waste basket in the bathroom and that was it! The beds were not made and we did not have any clean towels. -> NOISE levels were also a concern. We had an adjoining room and the walls seemed paper thin. The family next to us were very loud and had a boisterous toddler. Thankfully, they seemed to retire early. But if you were stuck next door to a late night party crowd, you'd be in bad shape. ->PLUMBING was terrible. Our sink did not drain well and the last day our toilet backed up. NOT GOOD! -> ELEVATOR service was bad. They have just two elevators servicing seven floors and they were jam packed all the time. Half the time we ended up taking the stairs. Imagine the remaining floors experienced the same trouble. -> GLASSES! Several weeks ago, a friend forwarded me an undercover video showing maids at a big hotel chain washing glasses with glass cleaner or worse, just rinsing them and wiping them with dirty rags. I was sickened to see that the Park Central still has glassware. Although it may very well be 100% cleaned, I still wish I had brought some plastic cups along just to be on the safe side.

Did not eat at the hotel but nearby dining options are too numerous to mention. No problems at all with check in or check out. Room cleaned every day without any specific request.Luggage stored for free on check in day and for a small fee at check out.

This hotel is so convenient to everything...we did the carriage ride (a little pricey but definitely a must-do at least once), we used a car twice (drivers both very friendly), cabs a couple of times, (some cabbies would not take us where we needed to go for whatever reason), saw GREASE (wonderful!). Overall it was a very nice couple of days with my daughter and we walked many miles. I would recommend the Park Central during special offers (for those on a tighter budget), and I would book here again on a future stay (during a price special). The flat screen TV was nice, the shower was weak (needs more power) it took a long time to wash hair, toilet seat needed repair, and hair dryer was broken off the wall (I used my own that I brought anyway).

Great little bar/restaurant (french themed) one block over for martinis at 6/57th.You can walk everywhere from here. The hotel smells great the moment you slide through the revolving door. Clean and busy lobby. Service was completely fine for me at the front desk. In fact I made a joke about the comments on this site and they were aware and appeared to be taking the issue seriously. There was a problem with another client's luggage being lost at the baggage check, but the fellow made such a scene that security was called. The baggage check is run by a separate business, so just be aware of that. We had no problems- well taken care of. The room was clean, spacious for NYC standards and the bed was just perfect after a long day of siteseeing. The water pressure in the shower was a bit light, but passable. The maid I believe stole some hair product I left on the counter. This was very odd to me. She took nothing of value- just that. Perhaps she accidently threw it out???? Anyway- hide your hair products! Elevators- just a bit slow, but I have seen much worse. Overall, this was a great place to stay for the price.

I had forgotten a toothbrush, but when we returned to the hotel that night the front desk brought a complimentary one up to my room (when I answered the door the person just handed me the toothbrush while talking on his cell phone and walked away.. usually I would tip for a delivery like this..). When I went to wash my face there were no face cloths. My mother said there were also no face cloths when she had stayed the year before. I called down to the desk, and the front desk agent seemed quite annoyed that I was calling with another request.. but after a large sigh said he would send them up. They never came.... until 9am the next morning. The second morning of our stay, the used face clothes had been taken away, but never replaced... at this point, we just decided to use the handtowels as face cloths. The Park Central and its team definitely failed my expectations but the hotel itself and location were good, other than the feeling that we were staying at a hotel that could care less about their guests... (maybe because this is a high traffic hotel and they are not concerned with encouraging repeat guests or bad reviews).

Tip: if you are going to be going to LAG airport, the Park Central offers a car service that is approx $45 including toll charge, tip, etc. Taking a taxi will work out to be almost equivalent, minus the better car, air conditioning, etc.... so opt for the car service!", "Date": "July 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Innsbruck", "Title": "\u201cminimalist\u201d", "Author": "AlfredAustria", "ReviewID": "UR8240842", "Content": "I spent 8 nights in a not too big room with an acceptable bathroom.

I/we, travel a lot, but what seems to be important or irritating to one person, may not matter to another. The Park Central is located in a lovely section, near Central Park, Columbus Circle & Carnegie Hall. In hearing this, I assumed it would be more upscale & the service would have been outstanding. I was wrong. The website does a wonderful job of supplying an interactive map for your navigation to various sights & sounds of the area. The hotel staff, however doesn't really care if you have enjoyed your stay, or if you need any help. We arrived early, about noon, which we knew we would, but that was out of our control. The lobby was full of people waiting to check in or waiting on transportation from checking out. The lobby actually looked like it was being used as some type of refugee shelter due to the number of people waiting with all of their luggage. There wasn't anywhere to sit, or really stand comfortably. We were told that our room wouldn't be available until 4pm, which in itself is rediculous, but what can you do? They stored our luggage for us, and we headed out to investigate the area. My husband has been here for business a number of times. This the first time for myself & my daughter. We window shopped up & down 5th avenue for 4 hours, then headed back to the hotel to check in. We were tired, (had been awake since 3am to travel) and wanted to freshen up & change our clothing. Again, we were told that our room wasn't ready. It was now after 4pm. The three of us sat in the lobby lounge waiting. After about an hour of waiting, and of course a beverage, because \"you cannot just sit there, you have to order something\", we were told our room was ready. We went up to our room, which was nothing spectacular. Our \"view\" was of a brick wall for the neighboring building. The closet door couldn't be opend all the way, as it would hit the bed. The bathroom was roomy, but offered nothing in the way of vanity space, I had to shut the lid on the toilet & use that as a holding place for my facial cleansers & cosmetics while getting ready. We went back out, enjoied our time, then went back to the hotel to sleep. The heat/air conditioning was not working properly. The room was very stuffy, so my husband looked at it and discovered the filter was so clogged that no air could flow. He removed the filter, set it off to the side, and we had air flow, and some comfort. After traveling & staying out as late as we did our first day, we didn't wake up early. At 10am the cleaning staff would have barged into our room if we hadn't had the latch flipped, which is interesting to me since I had to wait until after 5pm the night before to even get into a room. They didn't knock on the door or anything. I am accustomed to a knock or tap on the door, someone saying that they are from the cleaning staff or something, and waiting for a response. Not at Park Central Hotel, they just barge in, unannounced. When I got to the door I appologized and said that we were still sleeping. She snapped at me & said, \"You are supposed to put the \"thing\" on the door. I have to make a report of who is in & who is out!\" I apologized again, put the do not disturb on the door, told her we didn't need anything or cleaning for that day. So, we got up and started our day. When we returned to the hotel, they had been in the room!! Even after the conversation earlier, they still went in our room. It wasn't cleaned though. The trash hadn't been emptied, the filter for the heating & air was still sitting right in front of the unit & the coffee supplies were not replentished, they had even left a 1/2 drank coffee on the desk! The next day we went out, specificly said we wanted our room cleaned, and again, only half done, no coffee supplies, but they had cleaned the coffee area & coffee maker, air filter still in the same spot as before. Our last day, Monday, my husband had his meetings, & our daughter & I were on our own. She & I headed off to Chinatown & Little Italy. It was rainy that day, very rainy, the entire day, but we weren't going to miss these shopping opportunities. Spent our day out, got back to the hotel about 8pm, to find the air filter still in the same spot, the coffee supplies not replentished, and the trash very very full. We wanted to order \"New York Style Pizza\" & stay in for the night, getting ready to leave in the morning. So I called the consierge desk, which ony has 8-5 hours and it was about 8:30pm. So then I called the front desk to get their suggestion on where to order from. I waited on hold for 5 minutes, the lady came back on & gave me a name & number, I thanked her, we hung up. My daughter & I discussed our days events for about 15/20 minutes then decided ro order our pizza. The number the front desk gave me had been disconnected. SO, not too much help thier either. This was the only time I called the front desk our entire stay, so they failed completely. The cleaning staff didn't fail completely, but they did fail, in my opinion. Remember, this is only my opinion, someone else may not even mention some of what I found to be bothersome. It is all perspective. Would I stay in this hotel again? I don't know. This was set up for us by the company my husband had meetings with. The city is wonderful, there is so much to see & do, literally never sleeps. One other thing I would like to mention is that I have always heard how New Yorkers are rude. This is completely incorrect. At least from the experience I had. The people we encountered that were rude were the other tourists. This was a very interesting discovery to me. Every New Yorker that we encountered, outside of Park Central Hotel was polite, helpful and at least smiling & cheerful. I didn't encounter any gruff persons, other then inside the hotel. As far as getting my \"New York Style\" Pizza, we had pizza, but I am not sure if it was a classic noew york style, you know?", "Date": "July 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cDisgusting\u201d", "Author": "ChloehAustralia", "ReviewID": "UR8219371", "Content": "I am a frequent business traveller to NYC and I was booked into this hotel by our travel agent.

I was slightly apprehensive as although I usually find US hotel star ratings to be better than their equivalent in the UK ( e.g. a US 4 * will be more like a UK 5* ) we did have a dreadful experience last year of a Washington 3* hotel that I am sure would not merit any rating whatsoever here in the UK! However I need not have worried. We got what we had requested - 2 double beds in a non-smoking room. It was not on a high floor but I had not asked for it to be as I didn't intend to fly across the Atlantic to spend a weekend staring out of a window! The room was large, clean and in a good state of repair. Some people seem to expect hotels to re-decorate a room especially for their visit. True it wasn't ready for us on arrival at 2pm which would have been welcome as we were just a little tired and grubby but it was ready at 4pm as we were promised. The first night we were disturbed a bit by what we later found to be the metal plates on the road as vehicles passed over them but that cannot be blamed on the hotel. When we stayed at the Park Central there were lots of teenage American youngsters staying ( I believe there was a choir competition at Carnegie Hall ). On our last night a group of them gathered in the corridor talking and laughing until nearly 1am. I'm pretty sure they were not drunk but simply in high spirits and with young abandon did not realise they were creating a disturbance. Again this was not the fault of the hotel. However I phoned Reception who apologised and said that they would sort it. Within 5 minutes we heard a Security man politely point out to the youngsters that they were making too much noise and they immediately disbanded. My only bad thing to say is that when we were in the lobby with our suitcases having checked out we were approached or should I say pestered by several of the hotel's porters offering to get us a taxi to the airport at prices that I knew to be far in excess of the official Yellow Cab rate. They tried to tell us that the fixed fare only applied from JFK, not to it. To be honest they were a real nuisance and the hotel should 'rein in' their employees who are obviously out to fleece the hotel''s guests.

That being said, I thought it was imperative that I share this recent stay at the Park Central NY with all of you. My co-worker and I recently traveled to New York on a business trip and ended up booking a room at the Park Central. We frequently travel to New York on business and it presented a great location close our business in midtown Manhattan. That was about the only positive that I can associate with this hotel during my trip. Upon arrival, we come to find out that our reserved king/non-smoking rooms were given away to another party and that all they had available were twin bed non-smoking rooms. Of course, these rooms were located in the construction zone on the lowest floor possible. There was only one working elevator in this section and it took us about 15 minutes just to get up to our floor. First, my co-worker entered his room and it smelled like someone's dirty sock. It was also very small and dirty. My room was a little cleaner so I promptly went to sleep. Waking up in the morning presented little surprises...many of them. I got up out of bed, turned on the light in the bathroom, and roaches ran like lightning. I immediately went downstairs and reported this to the staff who magically had a king non-smoking room appear in the new tower (this of coarse wasn\u2019t available 5 hours prior) which immediately which I moved to. The newer room wasn't as bad as the old room, but if any other hotel had availability in midtown, i would have immediately left. We both paid over 400 dollars a night to stay here. That will never happen again. I hope this helps you select your hotel when traveling to New York.

But we put our baggage in the starage room, (which by the way if you wish to do so after check out there is a charge per item), and went exploring.

I felt a bit cheated. When I say superficially cleaned, the surface was clean but the room was grubby, dust settled in areas and marked walls etc. The other complaint I had was on the morning of check out the maid was knocking on the door from 9 am, (despite check out only being noon) reminding us that we were checking out that morning! However I didn;t complain about the damp and I suppose if I had of done the hotel would have changed rooms.

My folks booked rooms for us at this hotel, and since they were paying, there was not much choice in the matter. Truthfully, the location was ideal. Close to the theatre district, close to Times Square, right next to a major subway line, and very easy access to taxis. Our first impression was good. The doorman took care of our luggage and whisked us to the front desk. We were greeted with a smile and checked in quickly. We had asked for two adjoining rooms, which they did not accomodate, but we were only 3 doors away. The Bellman escorted us to our rooms. Neither room had card keys that worked, so the Bellman let us in with his Master key and went back down to get us proper key cards. The rooms were OK. Reasonably spacious for New York, with two double beds (we asked for that), a view of the street, decent bathroom, decent closet with a safe and a flat screen TV. The decor was tired, and there were some stains and marks on walls and in the bathroom. But no real big problem. Other issues: One of the elevator banks was under repair, so it took a while to get an elevator. My in-room phone's handset was broken, so I had to communicate exclusively by speaker-phone. The room rate was $250 which I gather is cheap by NYC standards, so I suppose you get roughly what you pay for. The lobby was nice, although constantly busy, and on our departure day, they charged us $3 per stored bag until we had to leave for our flight home. We had a nice weekend and did not spend much time in the room, so it was not a hardship, and the location was really ideal.

My choices were limited as there were very few available hotel rooms in New York for that evening.

And now for the negatives\u2026the room I was given was in a section of the building with bad signals for my cell phone/blackberry. I was forced to go down to the lobby to get a signal and make my calls from there. Perhaps the hotel isn\u2019t to blame for this, but obviously this was not very convenient for me. The room was very dark and depressing and in some serious need of updating. The paint was chipping on the floor boards and the shower had mold growing in it as well as other people\u2019s hair left all over. The lighting at the sink/vanity area was very poor. The drapes had stains on them. However, despite of all of the obvious aesthetic weaknesses of the property, the most disturbing part of my experience was dealing with the customer service. I only stayed one night (thankfully), but as I was leaving my room I realized that they did not slip the invoice under my door for an expedient check out process. I was forced to do an old-fashion check out at the front desk, however, there was a line with about a dozen people in it at 7:30 AM and I needed to get to my meeting across town so I could not wait in the line.

We booked the rooms (Superior King) in January directly over the hotel's website as not only did we get the best rates, but we were also able to add specific requests such as a room on a high floor etc. Then the panic began to set in. True, there are plenty of excellent reviews on here, but you seem to be swayed by the negative reviews for some reason. The video of the overflowing toilet posted to youtube really scared me! If I was going on my own, I would not have been bothered but was booking on behalf of 5 others and I didn't want any trouble landing on my lap! Given the price, we decided to stick with the Park Central. Location was the overiding factor and you can't get much better in NYC, especially at this price. For \u00a380-100 per room per day, the hotel easily surpasses anything you would get in London or any other major world city. Checked in at 3pm with no problem and no queue. This on a weekend just after Easter and also full of choirs performing at Carnegie Hall across the road. Many have complained about the check-in procedure, but it was civil and quick and I would have expected a much longer wait for a 900-room hotel. As for the comments about the New York attitude by some of the staff, you have to realise you are in New York; it goes with the territory and believe me you get the same 'tude' in Macys, Barneys and the Russian Tea Rooms! Best of all, because of my special requests via the hotel reservation site, all 3 rooms were upgraded to Concierge rooms above the 18th floor (many thaks to Savio the Reservations Manager for being true to his word in keeping to my wishes); the view of Times Square from the room window more than made up for the 7 hour flight from the UK. The rooms were clean, well decorated, clean and fresh bedding, and quality towels. If I had a couple of slight niggles, they would be the lifts that seemed to take an age to arrive in the lobby (one was out of action for renovation) and the lack of a lobby scene. The lobby could be made use of for socialising and the drinks in the hotel bar bordered on the expensive side. Saying that we didn't come to NYC for 5 days and nights in the hotel, but its nice to meet up with fellow travellers every now and again. Subway entrance is right next to hotel and the Gray Line sightseeing bus stops moreorless outside. Breakfast places on your doorstep (I'd recommend the Stage but leave enough room for the Pancakes!). 'The Irish Pub' across the road on 55th was a great place for a drink into the small hours. So was in I in the right hotel? Given some of the negative reviews, I don't think I was.

I had been worried about the bed configuration since the booking site we used would not guarantee it (I think Expedia but do not remember.) The room was very large so that we had plenty of room even with the rollaway bed. The bathroom was also large. Everything was clean and comfortable. The bed and linens were very comfortable, although the rollaway was not. I had a few other very minor irritations: *The sink and tub did not drain adequately but this seems a common problem for hotels. *The airline had delayed a piece of my luggage. I had to ask if it had arrived, and go to get it (10PM). Then I was told that it was in luggage check, and they charged me $3. They said luggage storage was a separate company and not complimentary. I've never been charged before for retrieving luggage an airline delivered, usually it just appears in the room; this seemed odd and unbusinesslike. *One of the concierges we dealt with was rude and arrogant (but the others were fine.) Overall I give this hotel good marks for a comfortable family stay. We were always happy to get back there at the end of our long walks. There is no coffee pot but there is a Starbucks next door.

But with so many hotels in NYC midtown, I'd stay away from this one at all costs. You can get a great location at too many other places to bother with this one. If pricelining, be careful to avoid the region this falls in (if it is still on priceline). When we arrived, around 5 pm, our room was not ready. We had a prepaid room and I had already called a number of times to confirm arrival time. Little effort was made for the room to be made ready in a timely fashion, and in fact we did not get in the room for another three hours, along with many other guests hanging out in the lobby - waiting. We were told we could not leave our luggage there while waiting (so we could go get something to eat) unless we paid! The attitude at the desk throughout all this was amazing. It was as if we had inconvenienced THEM. The idea that they promise a 3 pm check-in and are not at all perturbed that they have forty guests hanging out waiting for rooms to be cleaned was reflective of their attitude toward guests. The dirty room we got (carpet had spills all over, bathroom was not clean, dust everywhere) did have its bed made the next day, but shampoo, soap, coffee were not replaced. What is more, we no longer had towels in the room. They forgot those. Getting some towels to the room took four phone calls and a couple hours wait, because noone at this hotel could be bothered to deliver anything to the rooms. I know one can't expect much for service in NYC, but this hotel is deplorable. Stay at the OMNI, or Millenium Broadway, or Hilton Times Square when staying in Midtown.

We arrived at the hotel at approximately 2:30pm. The lobby was bustling with people. We approached the check in desk and Fred the front desk agent checked us in finding us a room although a little skeptical at first he would find us one. We were treated to a room on the 18th floor and although I thought we would definitley be high enough to get some sort of view it turned out that we had a view of the courtyard. The room itself was \"large\" by New York standards. There was a desk which had a coffee pot, telephone and directory on it. Beside that was the bureau with an ice bucket and flat screen television (husband loved it!). There were some scuff marks on the walls probably from suitcases, but no markings anywhere else in the room. The bed was such a comfort especially after spending the day walking around New York City. There were four pillows on the bed and a lovely duvet. Definitely the best part of the room. The bathroom was a bit cramped, but was clean and mould free. We had lots of clean towels, and there was shampoo and soap available to us. We had lunch in the hotel restaurant. I had the hamburger and my husband the turkey sandwich. The service in the restaurant was good - but nobody followed up to make sure our meals were ok, and it took forever to get the bill. The food was ok - but we could have gone out and had a better meal somewhere outside the hotel. The hotel itself is a short walk to Broadway theatres and shopping. David Letterman's studio is literally a two minute walk from the hotel. We only took a cab once and that was to get to Littly Italy - other than that we walked everywhere. We felt extremely safe. The nice thing about the hotel is it's just outside the hustle and bustle of the Broadway crowds, so it's really quiet at night. Restaurants near by we tried and liked: Breakfast - Junior's, Maison and Park Cafe Supper - Angelo's Pizza, Sardi's, Olive Garden The only complaint we had about this hotel was the concierge service. We spoke to one (Eastern European woman) and she was so unhelpful! She actually gave us the wrong directions to one place.

It was warm the first day and the ac only blew warm air, but we kept a window cracked and it was fine. The bed was huge, but not that comfortable. The sheets had a couple of holes in them and the comforter was a little worn. I've paid less for better beds in Marriott and Hilton/Hampton properties. The location was great. Subway on the corner, Starbucks next door and close enough to walk to plenty - Central Park, Times Square, Rockafeller Center, 5th Ave, etc. Plenty of food options nearby as well. Most of the staff was less than responsive. The lobby is always busy and any time I spoke to a staff member they had an attitude of indifference. They seemed bored, which may explain why the lobby was always busy - it got backed up becaue no one was in a hurry to get things done. When our driver dropped us off on arrival, the doorman ignored us until we had unloaded everything and were wallking in the door. Our driver, who we have used before and will use every time we come to NY said they usually ignore you unless you use a driver they booked. I called for an additional pillow at 11:00pm and it took 3 calls and 40 minutes to get one. I asked the concierge if he had heard about a walking tour that I had read about and he basically grunted \"no\" and turned around leaving me standing at the counter as if I were bothering him. One morning housekeeping knocked on the door (in spite of the Do Not Disturb sign) to ask if we wanted service today. On our last day I called at 11:00 and asked for a 12:30 check out and at noon someone knocked on the door wanting to know when we would be checking out.

We were also given a 1pm checkout for which there is no extra charge other than $3 per bag for storage. As previously mentioned, the location is exceptional. Starbucks is very convenient, however, the little local delhi over the road is mint!! You can get anything for a quick breakfast/coffee to start your day for a fraction of the price. We paid for the bus loop ($39 each for 24 hours). We found ourselves wasting valuable time waiting for the very busy buses so decided to yellow cab it for the rest of the stay. Much quicker, less hassle and very cheap.....even with a tip. $9 to Greenwich Village/Chelsea and about $6-8 for running around the city shopping!!!!!!! We tried the subway for an experience (and a laugh) and the staff directed us perfectly for this cost effective and insightful journey. We booked the Empire State Building on line as it said you don't have to queue with pre-booked tickets. WRONG!! We still had to join the back of the 3 hour queue so don't fall for that one! (And that was on the official website). However, do pay the extra for the Skytrain as it was such fun and very informative.

When I pointed this out, the night manager came out and said they could move us to one of those rooms the following day. (He was very apologetic - I get the feeling the staff knows the place needs work.) Still, I'm not a big fan of packing up and moving rooms, and I was offered a lower rate for that night - but had I not pointed out the descripancy myself, I'm sure I would've paid for the higher level room. However, upon being brought to our room, I quickly started calling other hotels. The entire hall and room smelled strongly of mold and mildew. Inside the room, which looked at a grey wall and had no light whatsoever, the fabric wall covering was lifting off about a three foot section of the wall. The paint was badly chipped and peeling, especially around the vent by the window, and the bathroom was, wel, rickety. We couldn't find another hotel for that night, but we booked one for the next nights of our stay and went to sleep. I will say that beds were very comfortable. But it was in the morning that we discovered the worst feature of this hotel - absolutely paper thin walls. We heard our neighbor's entire phone call, flipping channels on the TV, using the blow-dryer, etc... all as if she was IN OUR room. It was that loud. There was no way to continue sleeping. Yes, it's true you get what you pay for, and it's possible there are some nicer, non-mildewy rooms elsewhere in the hotel. But sometimes it's truly worth paying a bit more.

They were apologetic, couldn't do enough for us and let us see the new rooms before we took them (at that point we realised the couple in front of us changing rooms as well were the people who arrived with us the previous night). The concierges were extremely helpful with tips and advice and it's worth getting them to book your transport back to airport - we saved money and travelled in style! Despite the 1st night disaster, I would stay in this hotel again - the new rooms (922 and 862) were lovely and clean with fresh sheets, sinkable pillows, fresh towels and shampoos every day with pleasant housekeeping staff. I would just make sure I arrive for a 4pm check-in! Maintenance dept could do with pulling up it's socks along with the night staff but other than that, can't find fault with rest of stay and hotel is in fabulous location - opposite Carnegie Hall, on 57th St Metro station and Carnegie Deli is just next door.

The check in staff (with no queue!) searched for my friend's room, and confirmed he was staying there, and then allowed me to check in my bags into storage while I waited for him. They ordered me coffee (I'd been on a horrendous flight!) and allowed me to charge it to my room when they could ascertain what name I'd been booked in under! The staff were, at all times so helpful... I couldn't see any sign of that notorious New Yorker dismissal, and my room was cleaned every day. Admittedly, some days it was cleaned better than others, but on the whole, it was far better than I could have done in the time they have available! The lobby was always a hive of activity, with plenty of comings and goings, but was always clean and tidy. The concierge were amazing - they booked us a table at a great Chinese restaurant that they had recommended, and were even able to tell me where to buy some candy I'd been trying to find for a gift. There are two great deli's across the street, we preferred the Benash deli... wonderful pancakes!

Location: very good, near subway, Broadway, in fact everything you can walk. We dit this one day and take the subway for the other days to visit Brooklyn, Coney Island etc. Ofcourse lots of things to visit: shopping, NBA store, 5th Avenue, Staten Island ferry (free), Empire State Building, the tragedy you feel on Ground Zero, unbelievable and unforgettable, China Town for watches and handbags :) , SOHO, the financial center, Colombus, so many things. We don't used breakfast or dining in the hotel because there are lots of restaurant for breakfast, fastfood and dining. Disappointed things of the hotel: Check-in; everything went wrong at checkin. I give my vouchers but that was not necassary. Later at checkout the troubles begin. The rooms were on 10th en 15th floor. The room on the 15th floor has no view except agains a wall. I think that the hotel has a poor service in cleaning the rooms. In the 4 nights stay we had three times trouble. 2nd night: Room was not cleaned, beds were not done, towels were still on the floor, no clean towels. Because we were going out again they had the time to clean the room, making the beds and clean towels. When we came back it was done, except the towels. After a call they brougt clean towels. 3rd night: no towels , after another call new towels 4th night: exactly the same as mentioned at 2nd night, but because we visit a Knicks basketball game we came back late and the room was not cleaned, no towels etc. After 45 minutes (it was night-time) somebody was checking my complain. I asked the manager to come up but he refused, and in fact i was very p... I ask the manager what he was thinking about to solve this: he offered me a breakfast. That was no option, we were with 5. Then he offered a compensation for $ 30,00. At checking out there was a another problem. The reception want to charge my creditcard but i know for sure that the payment was done by the travel agency. Somebody else told that i must pay the bill and must declare the costs at my travel agency and walked away. Because my state of irritation was high i asked very friendly ofcourse ( Excuse Me) the person to come back and explain better or find a solution. Then the manager was on the reception and with some clicks he showed the personell that the payment already was made! Strange. Ofcourse I told the manager about the complains. Well he knew the situation and the 30 dollar compensation. (per day or for the whole period is not clear and i don't care) Now i'm waiting for this refund; will it come or not?? I already informed my travel agency. I think that a huge hotel is not working anymore with little hand-written papers what the cleaners were using. The lady who inspected the room wondered that the room was occcupied, because the litte paper says: not occupied. Ok, this is my review. Don't forget and i realize: this are incidents. But very irritating when you think staying in a nice hotel. It not so difficult to solve this, motivate your people. Wait; i remember one other thing: From JFK Airport to the hotel: there is no shuttle-service, but you can take a yellow cab, fixed costs: 45 dollar. When you go back one of the doorkeepers asked if we need a taxi. The answer on my question how much it was: 80 dollars. I told him that i paid 45 dollars from JFK to the Hotel. That was too much money i think. An other doormen asked me the same question: I asked how much: he said 65 dollars. An other option is to take the subway en the jfk train. We decided to go for the 65 dollar cab. After waiting for 10-15 minutes the waiting was not soo bad; because we did not get a yellow minivan cab but a very nice white stretched limo!!!! So now i know that a stretched limo is not only for the rich people. This was a very nice ending of our stay in Amazing New York", "Date": "January 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "alb1pgs", "Title": "\u201cLoved it\u201d", "Author": "alb1pgs", "ReviewID": "UR6611366", "Content": "My husband and I have just returned from a 4 night stay at Park Central.

I can now honestly say some people must expect way to much. The room was clean, spacious enough for the two of us, large king size bed, large bathroom, lotsof towels. Just lovely. Everyday when we returned to our room it lovely again, there were clean towels and it looked as it had when we checked in. We did not use the restaurant or the gym so I cannot comment on these. All of this we good but the best bit was the location. We did not have to use a taxi the whole time we were there and the only time we used the subway was to go to the statue of liberty.

We were very pleased with the Park Central. Our experiences with staff were consistently friendly and helpful - everyone from the front desk personnel, to the door men, to the cleaning staff. They truly went out of their way to try and be accommodating. Only the bartender in the hotel bar seemed grumpy, but she may not even be a hotel employee. And, our room was well-sized and well-cleaned during our three day visit. Everywhere in the hotel seemed clean, in very good condition, and well-equipped to handle the huge amount of guests they welcome on a daily basis. Also, we used the hotel's shuttle to LaGuardia Airport when leaving, which cost $45 and offered a much more comfortable experience for two couples to ride in a spacious, comfortable SUV rather than a cramped cab. I only offer two ideas of where the hotel could have more greatly met our needs/expectations. First, we arrived into the city several hours before check-in. They didn't have our room ready, which we absolutely understood. They do offer a luggage check room for $3 a bag, which seems fair and we had no problems with using it. However, the other couple in our party, who arrived two hours after us, were offered a voucher for free luggage check for their bags. We were under the same reservation (though in separate rooms), so I have no idea why our friends received this perk and we did not. But, when inquiring about checking in early, definitely ask the front desk if they can offer you a voucher for free baggage check if your room isn't ready. It would have saved us $12. Second, I am usually a great sleeper but had difficultly sleeping in the hotel for two reasons. First, I believe our room was near some kind of generator or water pump station for the hotel, and there was a regular mechanical noise throughout most of the night that kept me up. Second (and I realize this sounds silly), but the hotel beds have the noisest sheets I have ever experienced. Every little move my husband or I made was well-amplified because of these sheets. Otherwise, the bed was quite comfy. And, I would definitely stay in this hotel again.

The front desk staff were very helpful and gladly allocated us another room on a different floor. The room itself was modern and elegantly appointed, with an extremely large, clean, comfortable bed with new bedsheets and large LCD TV. We would guess that some modernisation has been carried out in the last few years. The room was serviced daily and plenty of clean towels provided. The sheets were always clean and crisp with not a hole in sight! The location of the room was also really quiet as it was in the middle of the building away from any traffic noise (which we would choose again over having a room with a view). If we visit New York again, we would not hesitate to stay at Park Central Hotel, and will be recommending this place to our friends. Yes, the room service is pricey, but you don't have to have it as there are plenty of reasonably priced deli's and cafe's on the doorstep for breakfast you'll be spoilt for choice!", "Date": "November 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland.", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Lousy Customer Service/Staff\u201d", "Author": "TracieHu", "ReviewID": "UR6155690", "Content": "You cannot beat the location of the Park Central.

Having said that..... the staff are deplorable! They made a mistake with our booking - we were booked in from the 11th to the 18th November. They were expecting us on the 1st because of a clerical error. Luckily I had brought all the confirmation emails etc with me, otherwise I'm guessing we would have been out of luck. They had charged my credit card $407 as a penalty before we got there and it took us the entire week to get it back. Their 'Guest Services' was a complete joke. We were ignored, fobbed off, blanked, talked down to... they had an envelope for us at the desk for 4 days and nobody told us until we went to them!!! Everyone else we saw at 'Guest Services' or at the check in desks seemed to be complaining about a problem with their booking. The Concierge was awful. We gave us asking them for advice on getting to the airport and sorted it out ourselves. And finally the room service is a rip off. We were charged over $20 for a bowl of bran flakes with milk. If you stay here be prepared for the complete lack of anything resembling service or friendliness from the staff and you won't be disappointed.

What a waste of time no funny smells, 25 curtain rings (yes we counted them) abundance towels (everyday I might add) extra shampoos etc enough for a family of 20 to be precise and fresh crisp clean sheets and not a hole in sight. there where 4 of us in our room and although we couldnt do the conga around it we found it spacious enough, very clean and just what we needed. I dont know what these people had to complain about. We checked in at 4p.m in super fast time with welcomes from everyone, so we where quite nervous about going up to the room we thought they where trying to hide something evil and murky about where we where staying, we where very pleased with everything about the hotel, from porter to concierge to room service to reception and the bar staff where very efficent and seemed to love there job and couldnt do enough for us. the only thing we would of loved in the room is tea making facilities, but we found a phone call and 10 minutes later we had the best cup of tea of the day.... As for the location we couldnt have picked a better place just a few blocks to the left Central Park then a few blocks to the right Times Square. If you want the best breakfast around go to Brooklyn Diner 1st left out of the hotel we loved it and returned 3 times the food and service is excellent a bit pricey ($66) for 4 of us but well worth it mmmmmm..For a cheap and cheerful brekky turn right out of hotel and 2/3 blocks down theres the 810 Deli the food here is great too and sooooooooo much to choose from ($38) for 4.... For meals in the evening we loved The Castle which is across the road and about 2/3 blocks right (round the corner from the Irish Bar ) the food here was scrumptious. Just be careful at all places you eat, they sometimes add the tip onto your bill, so just check before leaving a tip. So many things to do in just a short time, you should really go on the tour buses we booked 2 day passes on our 2nd day, they take you all around Manhatton and you can hop on and off everywhere, the buses run every 15 mins so you never wait long for 1 to come along. I f you love shopping your in the right town, we had to buy 3 extra cases,thats all our xmas shopping done... When you go to Macys go to customer service and ask for discount card if your from out of the country your entitled to an 11% discount on most items in store its great.. woodbury common is a must, Timberland boots for adults and kids are $40. Juicy Couiture jogging suits for $180 and lots anlots more, when we arrived at the bus station on our return we had no joy with cabs so hopped on a rickshaw back it was great we where all wrapped up and where home in no time. Then to 5th avenue where all the great names are, go into Tiffanys the decore is amazing. For make up and perfumes SEphora is the shop to go,they sell Dior, Clinique, Mac etc and there nearly all half pice compared to the UK, I drove my family mad, as I couldnt walk past 1 without buying something. We didnt visit the top of the empire state as 2 hours was just too long to waste so we went to the top of the rock wow wow wow its fantastic the views are unbelievable, we went as the sun was setting amazing... If you like a little more adventure you really must go on a helicopter ride we only went on the 7 minute ride but wished we had gone on the longer 1.. For those who like easier rides jump on the Statton ferry its free and takes about 40 minutes there and back you get to see the empire state with amazing views behind her...

Take the Staten Island Ferry, its free & you get a great view of the Statue of Liberty along with the skyline of Manhatten., takes about 40minutes round trip. Use the yellow cabs and don't be fooled into using any hotel private cars, even if they tell you your ride back to JFK will be metered - it is, but shouldn't cost any more than the flat rate on the way to the hotel.

I almost locked a few in my safe to make sure I had extras in case I needed them. The ammenities for shower are very subpar (soap are the HOJO kind and the combo shampoo/condit bottle is sad). 2) The shower has a fair amount of mold/grossness in the tiles - needs to be regrouted.

Sounds like a jackhammer or airgun in the stairwells? It got me me up every day. No need for an alarm clock at this hotel. 4) No room service menu in room, no room service after 11:00, no bottled water in room, no minibar, burned out bulb in bathroom, very weird throw pillows (plastic-y) 5) Very nice theater ticket agent desk in lobby 6) NO snootiness - like I see in lots of other NY hotels - maids and bellmen were nice - albeit a bit clueless about etiquette and did not let you go in the elevator first as they jammed their carts in, etc. They seemed to be hungry for tips everywhere you looked but I did not overtip cus I hate that! 7) No coffee/tea in room - so you were running downstairs alot and it is a HUGE hotel. 8) GREAT location So ---- if I were paying my own way I would NOT pay more than $170 a night for this hotel (watch out for all the taxes as it really jacks up the price) - the location is really good if you like to walk in the park and go to shows - and that is the only reason I would ever go back.", "Date": "October 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, KY", "Title": "\u201cEarly morning construction\u201d", "Author": "ssim228", "ReviewID": "UR6021228", "Content": "Hotel had a construction crew start jack hammering before 8:00 am.

We have stayed in many NYC hotels, and this is the first one we would never recommend. Check in took about 20 minutes and we were given a room that \"for some reason won't come up on the computer\". Bad sign. We walked miles to our room because they had recently stopped sending the near elevators to our floor. Every employee we encountered begged us to complain to the management about this problem. The room was fine at first glance. A nice flat screen TV and a bed that had spotless white linens seemed welcoming. The general appearance of the room, though can best be described as shabby. Nothing seemed fresh. The curtains only covered the 2/3 of the window, leaving thin sheers in the center which did nothing to block out the bright city lights for a night of restful sleep. The biggest shock was the bathroom. One tiny bottle of shampoo/conditioner was the sum total of \"ammenities\" and the curtain over the bathroom window consisted of an old shower curtain hung sideways and cut in half, held up by bent coat hangers. The first full day of our stay we left the room at 8 a.m. and returned at 9 p.m.to find the room had not been touched by housekeeping: The bed still unmade, the towels still on the bathroom floor. We immediately called the front desk and they promptly sent up a surly housekeeper who was furious at having to make up the room at that hour. She literally kicked our sheets across the floor and glared at us the entire time she was there. Meanwhile, we had complained about the makeshift shower curtain drape at the front desk and they did not seem to understand why this was a problem. It was a weekend and they shrugged and told us to tell a manager on Monday. When we returned to our room the next night we found someone's rubber cleaning glove had been left in our sink. I guess we should have just been happy that housekeeping had made an appearance, but it was not pleasant wondering how many toilets that glove had cleaned before coming to a rest in our sink. Again we approached the front desk, and again, they really did not care. The only positive comment I can make about the room is that the bed was very comfortable.

Since the reviews seemed somewhat mixed, I took a step out on faith and made reservations at this hotel...BAD DECISION! I stayed over Labor Day weekend and since I had a late flight did not arrive until approx. 1:30 a.m. To my dismay there was a large group of people seated in the lobby with their luggage when I walked through the door. Upon walking up to the reservation desk to check-in I was instantly told that there was a problem and the manager would have to speak with me before I could check-in. After watching him sashay back and forth on his cell phone for about 5 minutes, the manager finally walked up to the desk to assist--only to walk away 30 seconds later to do something else!!! The situation really became outrageous however when the manager issued hotel keys to a couple who had walked in an estimated 15 minutes after me despite the fact that I had been waiting patiently. Of course, when I interjected he had the nerve to react toward me as though I were the one who had committed an offense. He claimed that he didn't know the reason I was standing at the counter despite the fact that he has just walked away minutes earlier and I had told him I needed to check in; then upon giving him my name he claimed he didn't have record of my reservation. After pulling out my confirmation, he miraculously located the reservation, but then claimed that the computer didn't have me arriving until the Saturday. Considering the fact that is was 2 a.m., it was Saturday, but he had the nerve to get snippy and say that check in wasn't until 3 p.m.--which was irrelevant since the confirmation was printed in black and white and clearly indication that I had made reservations for a Friday arrival. Furthermore, upon issuing my key, Mr. Personality put me in a room with one double bed, despite the fact that I had paid extra for two, and it was not dependent on availability at the time of my check in. When I complained at this point I was told that there were no more rooms with double beds and I would have to take the issue up with Hotels.com. Upon question however I was advised that I could change rooms the following day, but Mr. Personality made sure to NOT notate my reservation to make sure that I would be able to do so with ease. After finally getting a room, I did find stray hairs in the hotel bathroom and there were holes in the bed sheets, but after switching rooms the following day, the remainder of my stay went pretty well--and I agree that the location is AWESOME. I guess that give the hotel an advantage in terms of serving up horrible service whenever they feel like it. In hindsight, the rest of the staff seemed pretty gracious, but first impressions are lasting impressions and I don't think I'll be staying at the Park Central again. If I have to pay extra money to receive more commendable service, then so be it. P.S. Turns out that since it was raining (remnants from Tropical Storm Ernesto), several of the rooms were leaking and the people who were seated in the lobby upon my arrival were graciously waiting to be moved to new rooms. The manager never did personally relay any of this information to anyone while they were checking in, despite the fact that they were using a system where the agent at the desk was instantly advising everyone that there was a problem in the hotel and the manager needed to have a word with them. I just happened to overhear the agent relay this information to someone in the line behind me.

If you go right out of the main entrance, it is a 10 minute walk to times square. If you turn left, you can be to Central Park in 5 minutes. There is not a better location than the Park Central. You can walk to 5th avenue shops in 15 to 20 minutes and Rockafeller Center is only a short walk as well. There is a Starbucks right next door. There are tons of great places to eat near this hotel. I have been to hundreds of restaurants in new york and have found a few to be the very best. 810 Deli and Cafe on 8th Ave. between 40th and 45 St. is excellent. It is quick and cheap, but the food is fabulous. If you are looking for somewhere good in chinatown, XO is probably the best general Chinese restaurant. It is run by a Chinese couple and although they don't speak much English, it's easy to order and the food is wonderful and very authentic. Check in is not until around 3:00, but they keep your bags for only $3 a bag, which is cheap for nyc. Also, if you want to see a Broadway Show, especially if it is your first time I highly reccomend Hairspray. It is fabulous. It is by far my favorite one and i know people of all ages love this for the costumes and music. I hope this has been helpful.

When we asked for them to change the bed sheets they didn't come. When we complained to the manager they finally did come and put 4 sets of sheets on, including on the pillow cases. We assume this is for their ease when we check out - they can just remove the top sheet and viola'...clean sheets for the next guest. Disgusting.

Times Square 5-10 mins the other direction.

The first night, we had a room with a wonderful view on the 17th floor like we had asked for and yes, the plasma TV is nice. But the room was HOT! We fiddled with the air and cranked it down as low as it would go...barely a breeze blowing out. Wake up all through the night in puddles of sweat. Call front desk next morning to request it to be fixed or have a room change. On hold forever, finally told that they would send someone up. Nobody comes. Call again, finally a maintenance man comes up who doesn't speak English. Fiddles with it for about 30 seconds, tells us to close the drapes and let it run and then leaves. We go out and come back in the evening to a room just as hot. Call front desk again, getting more frustrated now looking forward to another night of this. Am told to open the window. I said for $550 a night, I'm not opening a window...it's JUNE! Another maintenance man comes up, says it needs an overhaul, nothing he can do. He calls the front desk and tells them how hot it really is and that the only thing opening the window will do is let out any little bit of cool air the unit might be blowing out. Told, sorry, hotel is booked, nothing we can do. I charge myself down and find a manager. Explain to him the situation and that I have been asking for a room change since that morning and it shouldn't have taken all day to get to this. In addition, I explain to him that my daughter has severe allergies and breaks out in itchy hives when she sweats. Magically he finds another room. I ask him about compensation for all of this and he says \"you booked through an online service so I can't do a rate adjustment, I don't even know what your rate is\". And not at all apologetic. So we drag our bags and our two sleepy little ones at midnight to another room which was not serviced by the same elevators. In other words, we had to get on one set, disembark on floor 3, travel across the hotel, get on a different set and go back up to floor 6...huh? New room is cooler but now we have a view of 4 walls that made me feel like an enclosed prisoner. Seriously, I almost felt a panick attack in there. And gone was the nice plasma TV. And gone was a vanity in the bathroom. Now what we had was just a sink...a freestanding one...with no counter at all. And a broken drain in the bathtub. Oh, and when housekeeping came, they removed all our towels and left us with NONE. No towels at all. Oh, and when I went to ask the concierge for some assistance, she was in the middle of what was obviously a personal call and as I was standing there, gestured with her hand for me to wait without even looking up and making eye contact. I finally had to give up and walk away. When we were in upstate New York earlier in this vacation, we stayed at a $90 a night motor inn that treated us like royalty and we wanted for nothing. Here for $550 a night you get treated like a nuisance and don't even get the bare necessities.

Checking in was proficient, extending my stay by a further night took 15 long minutes by an employee who initially approached me when I was queuing up - 10 out of 10 for courtesy; 5 out of 10 for making the extension. I don't expect much in a New York hotel room. Having stayed in W Hotel (Lexington) and Sherington Manhatten (for which I consider to be equivalently priced), the room was reasonably sized. The hotel booking was made at the last minute, hence I got a building view with two queen sized beds. I couldn't be bothered to stick them together to make them a super super king size one, but the potential was there. There was a nauseating smell in the corridors. The maid did a lousy job (I just didn't have the right denomination of dollar bills, I promise). She kept on replacing my dirty towels...with my dirty towels. A soap bar and little else in the way of complimentary toiletries. TV was alright, with enough pointless channels to pass the time by. The dinner menu was missing from the booklet and besides, the kitchen closes at 10pm I later found out - wouldn't you think they could profit from making it 24hrs like most of the city is open for? Dry cleaning did the same day service for the price of overnight, which was a pleasant surprise. The ironing board/iron was handy and there were enough wardrobe space and drawers to even accommodate my wife should she have accompanied me - to put her clothes in... I only had breakfast at their cafe each day. One is seated reasonably quickly and the buffet is small, but very tasty. So far I have not been impressed with New York hotels. It's like they've spent all their money on a plush lobby and failed to deliver on the rooms (the place you spend most of your time). The maid service was terrible - ok i failed to tip - but folding my dirty towels for me to use again day after day is not on and the decor needs modernising.

I was skeptical. Any hotel near all the \"Hot spots\" and fancy items is going to cost more and have less to offer, but surprisingly this hotel offered more at 139 dollars a night than I'd ever expect. Although, my experience is unique they treated me right. Firstly, we got in very late so they overbooked the room we were in, I became nervous, she gave us keys we went upstairs...not realizing that we were going to a suite, we now got to stay in a 399/night suite for 139. It was clean, goregous view (22nd floor), clean, and clean again, trust me some NYC hotels no matter the price are dirty, lovely clean white linens, huge bed, and two televisions, LCD large. I hear the internet was a rip off, I didn't bring a computer, I was on vacation and avoided the internet at all costs on this trip, but if you're looking for free internet, you're not going to find it at this place. The second best part was leaving, only because we had planned to take subway to airtrain for our flight, but the head bell hop I believe? he managed to get us a sweet ride for under 50 dollars, to JFK and let us stop two places on the way! Mind you this was during rush hour/shop time and should have cost at least 75-90 dollars. Now, some may think these reasons are not satifactory...given the fact that I'm a punk rock girl traveling with her punk rock bf, and we look less than professional and financially stable, we were not discriminated against at all, problems I've always had at hotels, even though appearance is quite opposite to my bank account. I felt as if I was treated as a guest/customer and not some urchine they wanted to usher out of the place quickly and quietly.

I couldn't have asked for a better location! To the left (4 blocks) was Central Park where I took a great horse and carriage ride. To the left was Times Square. Right outside the hotel was a subway system which was very convenient. I wouldn't recommend taking the subway too often, as you will miss some great shopping and woderful cafe's. I have only a few negative things I could say about Park Central. First, I was in a smoking room. As soon as the elevator opened on the floor, I could smell it. It smelled like a club, no ventilation in the hallway so no way for the smell to escape. But, hey, I asked for a smoking room so my fault entirely. The room did not smell of smoke, thank goodness. Second, the housekeepers put the heat on full blast every time they cleaned the room, so it was very hot. Thankfully, I could turn it down (I read that a lot of rooms in NYC don't have this). The windows opened so I could cool the room down a bit, so I'm not really complaining about it. Third, the ironing board was broken and it took quite some time for a new one to be delivered. I would recommend checking it out before you really need it, because the replacement iron was also broken and I had to wait again, just as long for a new one. Forth, check your bill. I had two rooms booked for myself and some family members. Both rooms were charged for long distance calls we didn't make. The check-out desk took the charges off without a problem, but if you don't know to tell them to, you will get stuck paying them. The concierge desk had several staff members. One was very helpful and the other acted like I was bothering her. But, you can get tickets for the theater and many other attractions from them, at a discount. Remember that, because they don't advertise that, you just have to ask. When asking for a good restaurant, I was surprised that they didn't mention their own hotel restaurant, so I didn't try it. Lindy's was a great cafe but a little pricey. I paid $23 for a piece of cheesecake and a cup of coffee (with free refills). Be aware, a lot of places in NYC do not give free refills on any drinks, and at $3.50 a glass, it can add up quickly. I have to say, I had a great time. I didn't encounter too many rude New Yorkers like I expected. Most of them were very helpful and friendly. Even at the airport when everyone was busy, before I even had a chance to read the signs to find my way, 4 different people asked me where I was going and pointed out the way. Very friendly.

My family and I spent 3 nights here. The location was perfect for going to a Broadway play or going to Carnegie Hall. I agree with past reviews the lobby of the \"luxury\" hotel is impressive enough but as soon we went up to the room floors you notice that the wallpaper is peeling off, the carpets are shabby, and all the paint work leaves a lot to be desired. The hotel rooms and hallways look nothing like they do on the hotel website. The only thing that looks like it does on the website is the lobby. The Good Points The rooms were a nice size for New York rooms. The beds were comfortable and I really appreciated the bedspreads were white so you would notice dirt right away. The Bad Points The ceiling plaster in the bathroom was molded and the wallpaper was peeling off. The bathroom was tiny. The room were also very stuffy. The hallway needed to be upgraded badly the rugs were extremely old looking and the walls needed a new paint job. The second day we were there we found a huge insect in our room. After killing the bug with a towel we pushed the towel into the hallway and walked down stairs to speak to the Hotel Manager. He apologized for the problem and advised he would send up someone immediately to check out the problem then he offered us a free breakfast. This is where the hotel really starting going down hill, if I found a bug in the room chances are there may be bugs in the kitchen which my cousin pointed out. To bad we had eaten there the night before after the bug problem we were happy to eat somewhere else. Later that day we saw another bug and asked to be moved to a different room. The second room was better but we still had issues with the bathroom, the inside of the shower curtain looked like someone had thrown up on it and the tub looked very outdated with mildew in surrounding spots in the bathroom. Once again management moved us to a third room the last room was fine. Final Points This hotel would be ok to stay at if they worked on painting the hallways, changing the hall rugs and make sure there was no mildew in the bathrooms. The hotel needs a face lift in all the rooms we viewed. On a scale of 1-10 this hotel is a 4. Due to all the problems we had at the hotel I would not recommend it to anyone.

On arrival we were met by the sight of a queue from the desk to the (distant) front door and a sign saying check-in started at 4. There were 2 (sometimes 3) check-in staff at 6 available terminals and a number of management types standing around or chatting with the check-in staff. One did manage to offer us gingerbread men but we would rather they had instead checked us in. We eventually checked in at 4.45 and took our keys up to the room where we discovered they did not work. I took the keys back down, queued for another 10 mins, was asked a series of questions about which lights flashed on the lock and finally had the keys reprogrammed and handed back to me. One of the first problems we noticed with this hotel was the lifts. You could easily wait 15 minutes for one at peak times (about half the day) and they seemed to have some weird car preference setting which meant that being on the 6th floor you rarely got a look in as the single occupants of the top few floors whizzed past in glorious solitude. In the room we finally worked out how the curtains worked after initially assuming there was no need for curtains as we had no light being at the bottom of the central well with a lovely view of the ventilation system. There were no tea/coffee making facilities, no mini-bar and the bath was dirty with some bedraggled looking hairs stuck to various parts of it. Sitting in the bath was uncomfortable due to the gritty residue of whoever had used the room before us. The next morning we awoke to the sounds of loud bangs as the hotels tarted some work on the xterior and then we were kept awake by the combination of loud radio and loud conversation from the maids who seemed to be holding a meeting outside our door this and every morning of our stay. We did get our room cleaned on all except one day, when they didn't bother, but the bedding had a disturbing tendency to fall off the bed during the night. On New Years Day, rather than brave the queues of New York diners for our brunch we noticed that the hotel restaurant was fairly empty so we decided to eat in there. We waited to be seated whilst the waiter finished his conversation with a couple in the restaurant and then we were shown to a table where we waited patiently for the menus. We waited some more. We read our paper as we waited. A number of waiters wandered in and out of the kitchen looking confused so we waited some more. Finally we stood up and went to the front desk to complain. The lady on the front desk asked me to wait while she got a customer services manager. He came over and took us to see the restaurant director as it was \"really his problem to deal with\". The restaurant director told us that it was \"just one of those days\" and he had \"spent all morning apologising to people\" and offered to reseat us. We decided to risk the queues elsewhere having now worked out why the hotel restaurant was empty today (and for the rest of our stay). As our flight was later on the evening that we checked out, we asked if we could have a later check out. We were told that we could pay $75 for 3 hours extra but that we would only actually get one hour extra as they wanted us out by 1pm.

HOWEVER, when i went to park central with my girlfriend, in all honesty, it was definitely a thumbs up. Of course, it's no trump tower or marriott for that matter, but then again, when comparing the price, thank Goodness for that. The point of New york city is the city - obviously. A tourist will not go there to stay in the hotel. Park central is at an EXCELLENT locatoin, walkable to all the main attractions because it is right downtown. walking distance to - times square, rockefeller center, serendipity III, bloomingdales, etc. a bus or taxi is required to go to ground zero, and financial district further south. Positives ---------- - In terms of the hotel itself, it was very clean - the concierge is very friendly, as well as most of the staff. This is definitely a plus considering the usual rude personalities of most of the locals. - no problems with the phone, t.v., AC/Heater, etc. (everything worked fine) Negatives ---------- - Had to ask for a pull in bed for my sister 3 times until it came (the third time i went to the front desk myself) - Our neighbor ordered room service, put their tray outside their door, and it wasn't picked up for the entire duration of our stay (4 nights) - styaed on a high floor even though i requested a low floor. very bad window view, we faced a wonderful wall and had to crouch down, and look up to see the sky.

When I returned in the afternoon between meetings to check in, the lobby was full of people everywhere, unbelievably busy. It turned out they were having some computer trouble and check-in would be delayed. I waited and was able to check in, finally, around 5pm. The wait for a bellman was estimated at 30-45 minutes, (!!), so I took my bags upstairs after a long wait for an elevator. The room was another story...it was very cold. The rooms are old, out-of-date, and not very clean. The bed linens are worn, furniture shows a lot of wear, and paint peeling on the walls/ceiling. The window was open; I couldn't shut it. I called downstairs and was told maintenance would be right up to help me. In the meantime, I went on the internet (not free, or reliable) and started some work while I waited. Two hours later when no one had come, the room was freezing. I called downstairs again, and was politely told maintenance would be right up.

We kindly requested a non-smoking room with king size bed and she yell out loud \"I'm checking, I'm checking\" overriding what we're trying to tell her. At the same time, another guest came down to talk to the clerk next to ours. He was extremely angry at the hotel for giving him an unacceptable room following by a room key that doesn't work. He said he had wasted over an hour. FIRST EXPERIENCE - the room was very old on the tenth floor (out of 24, I believe). Our ceiling peeled out and many pieces of them recently fell on the floor. Restroom was extremely small. The Zenith TV in the room was quite small and extremely old - the quality was so poor that we didn't bother watching much. The AC/heater unit was also very old. It had unidentifiable nasty stuff inside and quite loud. The knobs on the unit were all gone, but we could still adjust thing through the little metal toothpick sticking out. SECOND DAY - after one night of staying in this hotel, I started coughing. Not too sure where I got it from, but having that old and nasty ventilation unit in our room surely didn't help. The toilet now started to show up some flushing problem. But still was not clogged. THIRD DAY - more things to complain, but let's concentrate on the most important one. Today our toilet finally gave out and clogged. We called the hotel operater and forced to put on hold for a while. Finally someone picked up the phone. She told us someone will be on his/her way. We believed her and waited, waited and waited until exactly one hour had passed, so we called her again (follow the same process of getting put on hold), then asked the new guy how much longer we have to wait. It seemed like he didn't even know that a service request was made (I had to appologize to my wife for clogging up the toilet 'coz at this point, she had to hold it for a long time). After about 15 minutes, a guy came to our room with a plunger. Instead of plunging the toilet, he stupidly flushed the toilet, causing the nasty stuff to overflow all over our restroom floor. He then left the room and called for a \"back up\". Before he left thr room he throw all the towels on the floor to clean up (yes the very towels that you and I use after shower). After another 30 minutes, the new guy came in and cleaned up the mess. I requested new full-size towels, the same size as ones that were thrown on the floor by the previous guy. He was quite rude to reject it, so I went outside and asked the housekeeper person. She was equally rude saying that \"it's not easy for me\" - I was shocked! But at least now she gave me ONE small little towel. I was extremely unhappy, but at least now my wife wouldn't have to hold any longer. CHECKINT OUT - we didn't do the express checkout in hope that we can ask someone to compensate for our discomfort. Sure enough, we were rudely rejected again. She said that since we prepaid for the hotel (through online booking), the hotel can't do anything. I was like are you joking me? So despite all these, if you'd like to stay in this hotel - DO NOT PREPAY for it. I didn't ask to speak with the manager because I was too sick to fight over it (I officially had a cold, making my NY trip the most horrible vacation trip in my life). So I asked the checkout lady for something as little as a free bag check (cost $3), she said no but dismissed us like we were flies (yes she did the hand thing like we were kids). So we went to the bell desk, and the guy tops the chart in the rude-meter. My wife asked that we went to check in our luggage, he repeated with the rudest tone: YOU-WANT-TO-CHECK-IN-OR-OUT?

The city was incredible, and thank goodness, because it took our mind off of our terrible living conditions. All of my fears came true after getting this room through Priceline, then reading all of the reviews. I suppose if you are lucky enough to get a renovated room, it would be OK because the location is superb. But DON'T be willing to take the chance. If you get the room like we got, you will be VERY disappointed. There is NO WAY that this is a 3-star hotel. The room was tiny, with no decor what-so-ever. There were no bedskirts on the beds...you could see the stained box springs even when the bed was made. The ceiling was completely falling down in our room. I had a huge chunk of the ceiling in my suitcase one morning when I woke up. The bathroom was maybe 4ft by 4ft. There was no vanity other than the bathroom sink, and imagine that with 3 girls! That was also the ONLY mirror in the room. The TV was maybe a 15\", and didn't work part of the time. There was only one chair to sit on with a very tiny round table. Also, no coffee pot in the room...don't know about anywhere else in the country, but in Texas, coffee pots come in even the cheapest of hotels! The linen service was very poor...only towels or washcloths, but not both! Elevators were a nightmare!!!! Too slow, and not enough of them. Also, below our window every night around 12:30, there was a garbage truck that parked and made an enourmous amount of noise for 45 minutes to an hour. Honestly, I cried when we got there Christmas Eve night. I felt bad for my kids having to wake up Christmas morning in that room. We called to change rooms, but the front desk said that all of the rooms were the exact same, and they had all been renovated already! (not a chance!) It was 6 miserable nights! It was a dump, and I want my money back.

I got this hotel through a bid on Priceline before I read the reviews here and I was very nervous about it as a result. I believe what others wrote but I think that the hotel's worst crime is to be inconsistent. My experience was good because I was given a large corner room on a high floor whereas other were given smaller rooms that have still to be renovated (someone has to stay in those rooms if the hotel is full, I suppose). I had very little trouble with the linen service. We had sufficient towels, although washcloths seemed to be in short supply since ours were sometimes taken away without being replaced. We found an offensive looking stain on the down comforter that was between the topsheet and the coverlet. We left a note with the housekeeping about it and it was removed but not replaced by a clean one. That was alright, because we were glad to be rid of it and we just cranked up the heat. We didn't use any of the services mainly because we didn't require it and also to avoid ruining our experience if anything were to go wrong. We did pay $9 to store 3 bags, but that was after a cost/benefit analysis that found it worthwhile for us to pay to store them rather than lugging them around with us on our last afternoon in NYC. Lord knows $9 was nothing after all the expenses we racked up that week. All in all, it was a decent experience. I probably won't stay there again only because I would want to try a different hotel. For those of you who are thinking of booking here, you might want to assess whether the price you are paying is worth the risk of getting a bad room. I'd say that anything less than $175 is a fair value. For those that have already booked and are now spooked about staying here, I say that you should prepare to be disappointed but you may be pleasantly surprised. Also, it helps to be polite and friendly to the check-in clerk, they're the ones that assign the room. :) I made sure to take pictures of the entire room.

The lobby was draped in plastic & blue tape, with 2 of the 4 entrances closed, forcing all guests to come & go through one revolving door while staff shuffled bags through the one door that opened. The frontdesk staff was surly & abrupt. The 4pm check-in was later than any hotel I've stayed in. The $3/ bag charge to store bags until you can get into your room was ridiculous. No other hotel I've ever stayed in, in NYC or elsewhere in the world, has ever charged guests to store bags. The elevators were exceptionally slow. Thankfully, we were on the 3rd floor so we took the stairs twice- not a side of the hotel we were meant to see!

I went inside to the front desk to find out about having our car parked after we removed our bags and we were told to talk to the doorman. I went back to the car, and I guess I was expecting too much, because the only person we saw in front was a scruffy looking guy without a hat or name tag in an unpressed black coat with the collar turned up that looked like an old US Navy peacoat. When he approached, he said that he would take care of my car or I could park it myself, at which point my wife and I looked at each other, wondering if this guy was even legit. We honestly thought that maybe the car would wind up in a chop shop if we left it with him. Another trip to the hotel bellman inside, and he confirmed that this guy was really the doorman. We removed our bags and did receive a check ticket for the car, and that part of the check in went according to plan. The front desk then informed us that check in time was 4 PM, and that we could leave our bags in the check room until that time (for a fee, of course). We elected to carry our bags into the lobby restaurant and have a light lunch, as a few other couples who could not check into the hotel had also done. We received our first room key, and my wife and I proceeded to the room. The room was about 80 degrees, reeked of stale cigar smoke, and the air conditioner did not work. (We had specified a non-smoking room). I left my wife there with all our bags while I went back to the front desk to request a different room, and then went up to check it out. The air conditioner in room #2 did not work either, and the heat/cool thermostat contacts were locked on in heat mode, so basically heating would have been on/off with no temperature regulation. Again I went to the front desk, now got a key for room #3, and stopped in room #1 to tell my wife what was happening. She had attempted to watch room #1's TV while I was changing rooms and had found out that she couldn't even change channels with the remote - she showed me that the photo diode on the front of the remote had been removed. Room #3's air conditioner also did not work, but at least the thermostat for heating appeared to click on and off, so the temperature could be regulated. We decided that since this was our third room, we would attempt to make the best out of the situation because in all probability, we wouldn't require the A/C in October anyway. Going into the bathroom and turning on the lights, we found the shower light bezel hanging down and the other light over the sink had one of the flourescent tubes burned out with the other bulb being close to end-of-life with blackened ends - really dim. I fixed the shower light bezel myself with my \"30 years of road warrior experience hotel engineering kit\" - (Don't leave home without it). We then attempted to put my wife's jewelry into the in-room safe. Following the instructions repeatedly gave \"error\" in the display. I contacted security, and they said they would send someone right up. 40 minutes later, no one had showed, and my wife and I went out for dinner that night. The following morning, I went to the front desk and again requested that someone from security come up to check out the safe problem. This time, a security person did show up, and after checking out the safe himeself, he verified that it was in fact defective, and that they would have to contact the safe company. I was to tell the front desk and they would let us use a safe deposit box in their office at N/C, which they did. While the security man was there, I asked him why I got both a green AND a red light when I used my room key card. He said not to worry about it, that the lock had to be \"upgraded\". I thought - OK, and so. . . After a day in the city and an early dinner, we decided to go back to the hotel and watch TV, since the NY weather had turned nasty. The TV was an absolute disaster. Even though the on-screen text showed many different channel names, many of the same channels were duplicated 2 to 5 times as one surfed up or down (different in either direction), and many channels were missing as a result. If I attempted to access the hotel TV's \"menu\" (movies, guest billing, etc.), it locked up and had to be powered off to be able to do anything. These problems were present when using either the remote or the TV's front panel pushbuttons. Yet another trip to the front desk, and they said they would send up an \"engineer\" to look into it. I went back to the room before he arrived and removed the defective flourescent tube in the bathroom sink light so I could request a replacement when he arrived and get that problem resolved. After spending about 10 minutes checking out the tv and changing the batteries in the remote (obviously not the problem), the \"engineer\" stated that the problem was probably caused by the bad weather outside. He had no explanation for the lockup problem, however. Seeing the futility in getting the TV fixed by him, I gave him the defective bulb, told him the other bulb should probably be changed also, and he left to fetch two bulbs, which he replaced. Ahhh! Decent light in the bathroom at last! The next morning, on our way out, I went to the customer relations desk in the lobby, told of the problem with our TV, and was told \"yes, I seem to remember there being problems with the TV in that room in the past\". He made some notes on a pad, and assured me that it would be looked into and a voice mail message would be left for me on our return that evening. That evening - no voice mail message had been left, another trip to the customer relations desk, another \"engineer\" sent to our room, and this one at least acknowledged that the problem could be in the hotel's central TV system, possibly a bad addressing PC card, or the TV itself. No resolution was suggested by him, that was \"how it is\". My 30 years of troubleshooting experience as an engineer would have been to swap out the lousy TV with a known good one and at least rule out the TV as a potential problem even if I didn't have sufficient experience with the central TV system somewhere in the bowels of the hotel. I casually asked another guest on our floor if his TV was functional, and he said he also couldn't get many channels. When an engineer sees this many problems with completely disassociated systems such as air conditioning units, lights, safes, door locks, TV's, etc., it points to only one thing - poor maintenance practices, both preventative and corrective. My impression is that the hotel management thinks that most people are just going to be in and out for a brief conference or stay, and they can let all these problems \"slide\". I'm sure that the management would shake in their boots if they knew that an engineer was checking into their hotel, because an engineer tends to see many things that a less technically oriented person wouldn't even pick up on. Due to the fact that there is such a high guest turnover rate at this hotel, it may take quite a while before the lackadaisical attitude of the hotel management towards resolving internal problems catches up to them, but sooner or later, it is going to show up in their P & L statement. While we were staying there, the Park Central was undergoing a massive facelift in the front entrance and the signs were touting their \"new look\". Very frankly, it will take more than a new look for my wife and I to ever consider ever setting foot through their doors again. When one spends an average of over $300 a night for a hotel room, the least that one expects is for everything to be functional or an honest effort made by hotel staff to make it so. What this hotel needs is a strong manager to go in and \"kick --- and take names\" to clean up this hotel's image.", "Date": "October 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chippenham, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel in excellent location\u201d", "Author": "bcfcfan", "ReviewID": "UR4071849", "Content": "We stayed for five nights (22nd Oct - 26th Oct) and found the hotel to be excellent and in a wonderful location close to Central Park and Times Square.

I thought it was going to turn out to be a disaster. It couldn't have been further from the truth! We arrived on Saturday around 1:30 p.m.. As we pulled up, I was already impressed with the location, which is great. There was no line for check-in. The woman at the table was very nice and polite...she did inform us that there weren't any rooms ready, but that wasn't a problem for us. If they allowed everyone to check in that early, check-out would have to be at 9:00 a.m.!! We put our 2 bags in the bag-check (which did cost $3.00 a bag...but having to pay $6.00 was not going to ruin our time!). We stopped at the Concierge Desk and got tickets to the Sunday night show of Chicago. The Concierge could not have been nicer or more helpful (and we ended up getting FANTASTIC seats). We walked around Times Square for a while and had lunch, and then came back around 5:00 p.m. to check-in. Again, no line at all. We were checked in without incident and then went to the elevators. I was prepared for a long wait, with what I've read here, but I can honestly say...during our ENTIRE stay and many elevator rides, we never waited more than 40 seconds!! We entered the room and I can't tell you what a relief it was....it was very clean, with what looked like a new carpet, very clean bedspread and sheets and a VERY comfortable bed. The room was more than big enough for the two of us, and had a city view with two windows that opened all the way for fresh air. I entered the bathroom tentatively, afraid I would find no towels and who knows what else! The bathroom was very clean, and we had a 2 person supply of fresh, clean towels. (I will say that I did request a \"renovated room\", which meant that the carpet/mattress and linens had been replaced)..at some point they will get to all rooms, but until then, maybe anyone who is booking here should request the same). The only complaint at all was that the bathtub drained very slowly...BUT...we never called maintenence, because it wasn't too bad, and we were only there for 2 days. On our second day, housekeeping came and cleaned the room and left us even more clean towels! We proceeded to have a fantastic 2 days in NYC...They allowed us a late check-out at 12:30 and checking out was very simple, we just did it electronically in the room. If you want a receipt, however, you do have to go to the front desk. There were a few people ahead of me in line, and it moved VERY quickly. The man checking us out was very nice, and he asked me if I would fill out a survey, which shows that they are working on customer reviews. We never ate in the hotel, because there is way too much in the city to do...but everything else was just great. This hotel is such a great value with it's incredible location..it's in walking distance of everything you'd want to do....but just outside of the action enough that you don't feel the craziness of it all in Times Square! My best guess is that all of the problems written about on here were either a case of when the management changed last year, there was a period of confusion when all the \"kinks\" weren't worked out, so that is unfortunate for those people who stayed there during that time and were dissapointed. OR, people are looking for a 5 star hotel, which this is not...but you also can't get a 5 star hotel for what you pay for the Park Central.... BUT, if you want a good, nicely sized, clean room with a location that can't be beat and a helpful staff for a reasonable price, this is the hotel for you. I would without a doubt stay here again.

After sitting in the room for over an hour, the roll away bed arrived - a single. When I said we needed 2 singles for my 2 boys, the manager said that this was against fire regulations. Now this is the crux of the matter - the manager said that although I had a confirmed booking for 2 double beds (Through British Airways) this was only on the basis of a request and that we were not entitled to 2 double beds! Once I had discussed this at some length with the Manager, I finally got what I wanted, after being told that no such room was available in the hotel. .............Be Warned. Apart from that, the hotel was just about ok, it could really do with a bit of tender loving care and more pleasant staff.

I have travelled extensively but this was my first trip to NYC. We stayed at the Park Central May 19th to the 23rd because one of the group had stayed there before and insisted on staying there again. Why I cannot comprehend. As a new trip advisor member I had checked this place out and was very much afraid of what we would find on arrival. Anyone reading this review, pay heed to any negative reviews on the trip advisor as they are very accurate. Most of everything negative I read about, I suffered on my trip. On arrival, we were lucky to come at a time when there was little lineup at the check-in desk so that part was quite prompt. The wait for elevators to get to the room was long, due to the fact that several were out of commission and during our entire stay that was true every day. I noticed every time the elevator stopped that the hall area of each floor was dirty and shabby looking; wallpaper peeling, stained dirty carpet and worn out looking mouldings. On opening the door to one of the rooms (we booked two double rooms), my first impression was WHAT A DUMP! The room was okay in terms of size, but that was the only good thing about it. The carpet had several large stains and was very dirty looking. The furniture looked like it had endured several decades of use, scratches, dents, and looked very worn out. The decor of the room was dark and very shabby. The bathroom had mildew and mould in the bath/shower area and several tiles looked like they might be in danger of falling off. The tub and sink had some rusty looking spots and there were only towels for one, despite that this was a double and could sleep 4. The best part was turning down the bed the first night to discover the sheets on my bed were ripped! and I had this happen two other nights. The second room we booked was no better. Check-out was painful as the lineup was so long, it took an hour wait. The only thing for which I am grateful is that I did not see any bugs in our room as another reviewer did. For any who think I am too fussy or overly critical, let me say I am a very well seasoned traveller as I like to go to a different place each vacation and have seen all of Europe and Canada, and most of the USA, Mexico, and the Caribbean, so I have had my share of bad choices in the hotel department and stayed in a few dumps in my years. But I have never stayed in a dump and paid such an exorbitant fee for doing so. Thank God the city was so friendly and fun that it made up for the lousy accommodation otherwise my trip would have been ruined. Do yourself a favour and stay away from this hotel.

Obviously I was outraged, even in my many trips to this city, I have never come across something as crazy as this policy. I told them I was not about to pay the $75 when he told me \"uhhp, we DO have a room open.\" I accepted the room. I was later billed $75--but not as a fee, rather as a \"occupation of room charge\" wherein they can they freely tax (city, state, hotel (18.5%), and convention center). This \"discounted room\" ran us $249.00. ARE YOU KIDDING? We also had to switch rooms twice. The first room had no drapes. I don't mean it had a valance and no drapes-- nothing.... with high rises all around, no drapes. We were also conveniently placed above the mechanical units of the hotel which were very loud. After asking two seperate people to move our room, and explaining WHY, we were relocated to one floor down in the EXACT SAME SPOT. My husband and I are pretty young and we just sucked it up. However between no lightbulbs, no pulls to open the armoire and the toilet overflowing twice, we left that room,too. Luckily we weren't disappointed in the THIRD room where the ice machine outside our room sucessfully formed a lake soaking the carpet and, by the time we left, began molding.

The service of towels (which don't match--and in our last room was only 2), toilet paper, etc. that we called for was swift however. The mopping of the overflowing toilet was not.

Apparently the previous guest left his phone in the room and, thinking it was empty, was asking a hotel employee to get it for him. I found the phone and said they could have it if they came up right away. Didn't sleep well after that.

Since they didn't start out charging me and I didn't know why I couldn't get on, I called tech support three times.

We booked two rooms one with any type of bed the other with twin beds. The four night break cost more than $2000. When we arrived we were told that we had been allocated two one bedded rooms. We queried this and to cut a long story short the lovely check in clerk called the front desk manager and after quite a wait a portly man popped his head out, tapped a few keys on the keyboard and in true Little Britain style said 'The computer says NO' well actually he just said NO. In fact he said we don't actually have any twin rooms in the hotel- none at all, not none available, none at all. So I asked why had they had accepted our booking when they couldn't fulfil it and he just shrugged his shoulders. I said to him that it was showing as a confirmed booking for twin beds and he said that no beds are guaranteed until check in. I asked him to refund our money so that we could find a hotel with twin beds and he said No - we had made a confirmed booking and it was non refundable!!! We were allocated rooms on the 25th floor, one was quite large the other very small. In the small room they added a rollaway bed - all this money and one guest gets to sleep on a rollaway.. It could have been worse as when we were checking in a couple with two strapping teenage lads were also told that their room would have one kingsize bed and a rollaway. I wonder how Dad got on sleeping with his lads. The largest of our rooms seemed to have a bathroom designed for disabled access. The bathroom was approximately 10' x 8' and one third of this was tiled with a shower. There was no curtain and the floor was very uneven and cracked. When the shower was used it flooded the whole room and from the skirting board and carpet in the bedroom it was clear that it had flooded reqularly. The shower was really weak and very disappointing. In addition to the shower there was a sink and toilet, no shelves, no counter, no cupboards in short no where to put a toothbrush or toiletries. There was no where to put this in the room either so it was put in with the television as this was the only place with a shelf. The room itself was comfortably furnished and on the surface clean but the maid service was lacking - no towels, no coffee, windows left open on cold, rainy days. The small room had a very small bathroom but it was fully functioning. The room was also very noisy - we turned our air conditioning off but it was still really noisy, it sounded like an aeroplane going over head and there was constant traffic noise. The smaller room (very small) was at the back of the hotel and much quieter. This is my fifth New York visit and this was definitely the noisiest hotel. We were on the 25th floor and the lifts were hopeless it took about 15 minutes to get a lift and there were often long queues with lots of queue jumpers. There was obviously a leak from the ice machine as there was a wet patch on the carpet around four feet wide around the machine. This got larger over the time we stayed there. Room service seemed very expensive - french toast was $18 plus 18.5% tax plus $3.50 delivery (plus gratuity?) and omlette was $20 plus the tax and delivery. I thought that this hotel was over priced and the useless front desk manager who's only function seemed to be to tap the keyboard and say 'The computer says no' was a definite negative.

If you can get this rate, book it! It is simply hard to beat the Park Central's location. It's right on a Subway line and just far enough from Times Square to be away from the chaos, but close enough to be there in moments. I've stayed in a few New York hotels. I found the room to be quite large for New York. I think many of the reviews on this site are by people who do not understand what to expect from New York hotels (or by competitors trying to make it look bad). The rooms are typically smaller than anywhere else as space is at a premium in NYC. I found the room size to be more than comfortable. Yes, the rooms showed a bit of wear, but that's to be expected in a large city - certainly nothing to be concerned about unless you're paying over $200 (which I wouldn't pay for the Park Central). Here are a few other observations. Room location. Make sure you ask for a room away from elevators. Our first room was on the other side of a bank of elevators and it sounded like roller coasters passing by. I called the front desk and they accommodated me with a room change immediately. Front desk. We had no wait at all. I found it to be a pleasant experience. Again, your dealing with New Yorkers who are down to business types, so don't expect Southern hospitality! Bathroom. I found it to be the largest bathroom I've had in NYC - not huge, but certainly adequate. Water flow was rather low, but that's typical in hotels. Location. Again, it simply is hard to beat the Park Central's location. That is by far it's best attribute. There is absolutely no reason to be afraid of this hotel. Understand that you are in New York! The Park Central doesn't fall into the Deluxe or Luxury categories by any stretch, but it is certainly more than adequate.

As mentioned in a previous review, the faults are almost too plentiful to mention. A few details: 1. Check in. When we arrived at 10:00 a.m., we were told to come back at 2:00 p.m. for a room. We returned at 2:00 to find no rooms were clean yet. The desk clerk said to wait 30 minutes. We waited 30 minutes, then another, then another. Two hours of our first day in New York was spent waiting in a lobby with too few chairs, before we were let into the dingiest room in New York. We arrived on December 27th, a very busy day. But I've been in New York on busy days before and NEVER had to wait so long for check-in. The hotel's web site doesn't mention the 4:00 check-in anywhere, nor does Expedia. 2. Room: I had purchased a room in advance for four people through Expedia. The first rip-off was the additional $35 per night for each person exceeding a party of two. We were crammed into a two-person room with two soggy beds practically next to each other. No desk. Tiny TV with a remote that didn't work. Torn rugs. Mildew on the shower curtain. No shampoo. Two towels, total, for four people. A heater with a broken knob. 3. Elevators: This was mentioned before, but plan to wait for an elevator for at least ten minutes. And if you're on a low floor, don't expect to take the stairs. Both sets were closed for painting on the day we tried to take them. At least there wasn't a fire. 4. Service. Rude check-in people, maid entered twice without knocking, the garbage cans were not emptied, on the second day she still left two towels for four people. I've stayed in at least ten hotels in New York City, and this is by far the worst. And one of the most expensive.

We checked in after 11:00 at night and there was a 10-minute wait. Not a good sign. When we got to the room, which looked nice enough, I noticed that the bedspread looked too taught, as if there were no padding underneath. I should say that I never think of testing the mattress when I check into a room since, in the era of the \"Heavenly Bed\" when Westin and Sheraton are advertising how luxurious their bedding is, even 2-star hotels have decent mattresses. To my dismay, when I pressed down on this mattress, I was shocked to find that I could feel the coils! My colleague's room had the same problem. I called the front desk and asked them to change our rooms and was told that the hotel was completely booked that night, but they would be glad to change my room the next day. Easier said than done. So, even though I have arthritis that I knew would be aggravated by the awful mattress, I had no choice but to wait until the next morning, when I awoke aching all over. The next day, I asked 3 different members of the hotel staff about changing my room. They all told me that there would be no problem, but that I would have to wait until all the rooms were made up so that could try to find me a better mattress. This was not promising, since that meant there were no renovated rooms that they knew had better mattresses. They all assured me that they were putting 2 rooms \"on hold.\" I left the hotel feeling confident that my request would be honored, but I called at 5 p.m. to make sure. I was told that there was no record of my request, so I asked to speak to the manager. The manager told me that while he would make sure that our rooms were changed, he could not assure me of better mattresses. So, in the end, they did change our rooms, but the mattresses were no better.

That was ok for us. The desk clerk was very curtious as was the gentleman in bag check. We went out for lunch and shopping and came back at 4 to check in again. We were originally told that rooms were still not ready, but after seeing our tired faces, we were given a room with two double beds that just came up on the computer. I think if you ask nicely they are very accomodating. I will reiterate those who have said that the elevators are slow. I suggest going up and then down. It was the only way we went down one night. The rooms are small, but for NY they are pretty big. We had a nice room and a great view of 7th ave. The bathroom was huge and worked great. Our blowdryer broke. We called down and a new one was delivered within 15 minutes. One downside was that Friday night it was very cold and rainy. We could not get a cab.

I stayed with my daughter at the Park Central from July 9-14, 2004. We stayed here because we were referred by the Broadway Dance Center which is 2 blocks away, where my daughter was taking a summer intensive program. The rate we received was a special one arranged between the dance center and the hotel so it was a very good one. Now the location is excellent. The lobby of the hotel is nice and we were greated by a full door/bell staff upon arrival and given immediate assistance. However, when we got to the front desk, our nightmare began. The agent was new (I imagine) based on the fact that he didn't know what the hotel/occupancy tax was on the room and when I asked for the total amount for the 5 nights he told me just to leave my credit card and I would receive a receipt at the end. I told this gentleman, I want to pay in full now. I don't want you to swipe my card. I want to know what the total is for 5 nights plus tax now. He told me he couldn't do that. I told him to go in back of the \"MAGIC\" wall and find a calculator or his manager. I am a front desk manager and his behavior was absurd. Since when can't you tell me what my room/tax charges are in advance and allow me to pay them at check in? He then quotes me a price about $500.00 more than it should be because I am fully aware of what it should be. He is now multiplying with a pad and pen. I said again get a calculator. He said he didn't have one. So at this point I am doubtful of what to expect from this hotel. The alledged manager who came to assist who was not wearing a name tag, came and resolved this issue. He gave me a wonderfully mediocre room on the 3rd floor facing the roof. How nice. You would think after being at the front desk for 30 minutes and being a hospitality pro. myself, he would have given me a better room with a nicer view. Now the room itself was ok. So now the 3rd night we were there they did not replace our towels which I couldn't understand. So we called 3 times and even when out to dinner. So after a total of 6 hours, we still did not have towels delivered to us. So they gave us free breakfast. We go to the restaurant and they employees were very attentive and it is a pleasant atmosphere but the buffet is less than great. But it's free so who can complain after all, I felt really sorry for the people who were going to pay $20 a person and get at best, scrammbled eggs and pancakes. I've seen better buffets at my Son's school. Also, there is no On-Command system of movies or any entertainment in the rooms. Makes for very boring late nights. So to recap, this hotel is great for it's location. The bellstaff and restaurant staff are pleasant. The front desk staff is the worse I have even seen. Rude, unattentive, untrained and clearly don't appear to want to help their guests. I probably will not stay there again.

It was a business trip and my employer (the owner of the comany) was coming with us. After looking at our options, I chose Park Central because of the location, some reviews, and the style of the hotel and the amenities it offered. When most of us arrived that morning we knew it was likely too early for checkin. We had our car take us there to check our luggage. I inquired about where to go to check the luggage (most hotels I've stayed in NYC have doormen to take them or direct me) but I had to go to the front desk. She was terribly rude and told me that I needed to come back later. I reitterated that I needed to check my luggage, so she pointed where I should go...way down the hall, to the right and down another hall. We left and went to take care of some business matters. Another member of our party arrived at 11am and was told to try back at 2. We went back after 2 and was told (same rude woman) that they were all taken and to come back at 4). I asked why we couldn't go ahead and use our reservation information to check in and come back at 4 for our keys. She refused. Knowing this could happen all over again, I waited and then approached another lady who soon checked us into our rooms. I should note that by this time (3pm) they didn't have any doubles left, which was what two of the rooms I'd reserved were...and they didn't have any left because others had \"already taken them\". Without going into all the details, you get the point of the difficult check-in for six people who'd had reservations for two months. The first night was just \"okay\" and the rooms were decent. Nice bathrooms with black stone counters, elegant wallpaper, nice towels. I soon found out that my employers room was NOT so nice and they had to be moved. For one thing, their bed was made but didn't have any sheets on the bed, just the spread! Neither of their two rooms ever had a coffee pot or wash cloths and were still not they type we had reserved 60 days prior to the visit. By the end of the four days, we'd had multiple daily battles to just get wash cloths for our bath. One day we had to use hand towels just to take our baths...and this is after repeated phone calls (so called \"housekeeping\" that the front desk transfers calls to never answered after 15 minutes of rining) and actual trips to the front desk to request and complain. Each time we were told they were sorry and that someone would be right up to take care of it...which they never did. After the first day we didn't get any more soap or replacements for the used toiletries, no more coffee packages, no ice buckets in two of the rooms...you get the picture. Being in charge of all the trip accomodations, this has really placed me in a bad position. My employer trusts me to make sure the everything is taken care of and done nicely. Their shoddy service reflects on me. I pity anyone in the same position. If that is you, do yourself a favor and book elsewhere. If you want a soft, comfortable bed, you'll also need to look elsewhere. We stayed in a room in their top three floors (the nicest ones, supposedly) and it would be a real stretch to call that a mattress. Slighlty padded box would be more appropriate. The TV is a small 13\" set, not something you can watch a movie on and be comfortable. As a point of reference, we have stayed at the new Hilton on 42nd, the Hilton near Rockefeller, The Algonquin, Crowne Plaza, The Roosevelt and others, just so that you understand my frame of reference for Manhattan hotels. If you do stay there, be forwarned! They put a $19 bottle of wine on our bill from the mini bar. We never used the mini bar and the wine was still in it when we checked out.

The smell was not too bad while the window was open, but got quite cool during the night and the window had to be closed. I will have to say the bathroom was good size and the shower worked well.

Our room was spotless, bathroom clean with daily fresh towels and rooms cleaned on a daily basis. In this day and age you get what you pay for. You want marbled bathrooms; Egyptian cotton sheets etc go elsewhere. If you want a comfortable room, with a great location at a good price that will allow you to spend more money on other things stay here. P.S. one piece of advice always display the \u201cDo not disturb sign\u201d Housekeeping staff start early!!

But after staying at this hotel I can honestly tell you that I would highly recommend it and would stay there again if I got the opportunity. It was very easy to get a cab from LaGuardia to Park Central, the bellhop was very helpful, check-in was kind of slow and we could not check in until 4:00 but the hotel offered to hold our bags while we out to see some sights and get something to eat, the room was not huge but was big enough, the room was clean, bathroom was clean and spacious, and the a.c. was cold. The bathroom tub stopper was broken but was not a problem because I only take showers. I could see where this might be a problem for a guy traveling with his wife or girlfriend though. The staff was courteous and answered all of my questions about bars and restaurants and helped us with directions to Yankee Stadium for the game Saturday against the Red Sox. The location relative to everything else was tremendous. Short walk to Times Square, Broadway, numerous bars and clubs, restaurants, and shopping. I am telling you ... you really could not ask for a better location unless you stay at the W Hotel in the middle of Times Square. The entire trip with the ballgame, city, hotel, and everything else I give a resounding A+.

For five days we stayed in a standard non-smoking room with two double beds on the 3rd floor, was very clean and everything was in working order (the safe, the iron, the lights). Our only little complaint was that the room was a bit chilly because they closed off the building heat.

Following this discovery, the PC offered to put us up for the night in a dingy, rent-by-the-hour hotel, the premisis of which managment had never set foot on. Long story short, we spent the night in a PC conference room on thirteen cots, with no bathroom. The next day the PC tried to make amends by placing us in upgraded rooms and not charging us for out night spent in purgatory. However, promises were made and retracted several times and our overall experience was one of shoddy service. The one bright spot of our stay was a wonderful gentleman in customer service, Kurt. Efficent and willing to bend over backwards for us, Kurt was a ray of sunshine on our dingy, depressing excursion. Sadly, his superiors did not see things the way he did.
