The room, in my opinion, was decorated nicely. I loved the vintage desk, end tables and chandelier. It caused a cool effect on the walls. Basic cable and decent internet. The bathroom was very clean. Very hot water. We're from Florida, so it was a little cold for our blood. We had to call the front desk to ask if the heater was on when we got back to our room after a full day of sightseeing. They said it was central heat and would check on it. A little while later we could hear the sputter from the furnace. Didn't have a problem the rest of our trip. Very friendly service. The bed was on the very firm side, but the linens were clean and the pillows comfortable. Overall, it was a great stay for my first time in NYC.

The bathroom was 2/3rds the size of the room with a bath tub! The elevator was a bit slow and real small but never had a problem with not being able to get on it everytime. Love the free coffee, hot chocolate machine down the reception area. Friendly staff. We stayed 2 nights and the location was just great especially since we take the subway a lot. Lots of restaurants around the area. While going down the elevator one time, stopped at a floor where renovations were ongoing.

The desk clerk, who never identified himself to me, pointed me out the door and said \"you need a business center for that. Internet is provided as a courtesy\". I lit out to Starbucks and send my necessary file just prior to business close. When I returned I tried to re-engage him as I now had the luxury of time. His comment: \"you behavior was inappropriate\". WRONG. THINK AGAIN. Try competing in midtown without internet. Internet was de-facto unavailable. Never mind that the hotel maintainence staff earlier, even tried to move the cisco router down on the wall so that the antennas would stand upright to optimize signal. I went downstairs to the lobby at 11:45 PM to respond to the last emails of the day and I could hear the same clerk/owner/whatever saying \"he was upset earlier today\". I sure am.

Everything was beautiful and clean and the bed was a decent size for two people. The reason I marked this hotel low is the beginning was awful and after already forking out quite alot of money to stay here we still had to pay additional money to get a bed that we fit in and besides Alicia who was great the other staff appeared clueless and were unhelpful to us.

Housekeeping gave us loads of towels and they are changed every day. The heating in the room was nice and hot when it came on - you can't control it though, so it must be automated below a certain temperature. The bed was firm, comfortable and totally clean. Plenty of furniture to store stuff in, few more hangers wouldn't have gone a miss, I'm sure reception would probably supply if asked - we requested and were supplied with a fridge and hairdryer for our stay. The staff are lovely \u2013 very friendly and always there to greet you with a smile no matter what time of day. The hotel lounge is warm and inviting \u2013 the complimentary hot drink supplies were a bonus and be sure to check out the reading material available. The corridors and general fascia of the hotel are OLD - but it gives character, we actually preferred it to a more modern looking place. If you get hung up on little superficial things (or perhaps you\u2019re in your hotel room for too long in NYC?!) then maybe you shouldn't stay here. We stayed for two weeks and it was a pleasure coming home to this hotel each night. You will massively appreciate the location when you stay here \u2013 so many cafes, bars, coffee shops and much more on your doorstep.

The hallways were in pretty rough shape and there were huge holes in the walls around the electrical panel.. a little sketchy. I felt pretty dirty touching anything in the hallways.. again, once this is renovated and cleaned up, all of these errors will be fixed. The service at the hotel was quite good.

We chatted and he showed us around the renovated part of the hotel, which is lovely the rooms finished to a high standard, he has started at the top and is working down. We then upgraded to a renovated room for a greatly reduced rate than if we had booked one in the first place. We also came back to the room the second night and a complimentory bottle of wine had been put in our room along with a mini fridge. The manager also told us that he was at present struggling to promote the hotel due to the big divide. my only gripe on the new rooms is that they lack any safe boxes. The lift up to the room was also very hot and had no air conditioning. His plans are to renovate the front lobby area next then to carry of with the rest of the rooms. He also advised us to contact the hotel direct if we ever planned to return for a more favourable rate! My advice would be that if you want a trip down memory lane to youor student days then a budget room will do however the renovated rooms are worth the extra.

We had a shared bthroom compared to a private one, but for the extra it costs for a private one have a shared, they are clean and modern and unless its busy time of year chances are you may be only sharing with a few people.

We were offered a Military rate and quite frankly we were very satisfied we got a good bang for our buck! The hotel itself is certainly older (not quite as old as the city) but in a true NY way. Hotel desk clerks were very pleasent and informative. Room was clean - no smoke smells only noticed a slight 'granny's attic' musty smell. Linens were changed every day. Saw no bugs or creepy crawlers anywhere. Bathroom was clean and 4 bath towels were placed out every day All bathroom items worked fine. Only hint is to get Hot water we had to let the Hot water run 10-15 min before showering but then it was wonderfully hot. There was a small fridge and tiny coffee maker for snackers. TV had cable but limited chanels (maybe 20?). The best part was being within walking distance of practically everything (times square/grand central station/mood fabrics/bryant park/empire state bldg/rockefeller central/broadway). Every morning we had breakfast for 4 (Myself, a muffin type and 3 military men appetites) in various cafes & delies in the surrounding neighbor hood. We came on the train and walked from Penn Station to the Seton no problem. Only time we cabbed it was to the Statue of Liberty ($18.00 one way for all 4 of us). And then back from the Statue to FAO Schwartz ($25.00 one way for all 4 of us). We were trying to see a much as humanly possible of NYcity during our stay so we only were in the hotel from 11pm - 7am for sleep. Never had a safety issue either in the hotel or on the streets around it. Only missed internet but we did find several cafes with internet in the area so we could surf. We would stay at this hotel again as we are a Military family trying to see the world on a shoestring budget and would recommend it to anyone in the same situation. However, if you tend to be in your room as much as you are out of it and need lots of ammenities this may not be the place for you.

When we saw the very small reception area and narrow corridors we became worried. What a pleasant surprise when we entered the Queen room, it wasnt enormous but New York doesnt do enormous rooms! ample size for 2, bathroom was very modern and clean, small fridge and coffee maker perfect. Room was extremely hot !! but that was easily rectified. Only slight problem was the length of time it took for the shower to run hot but when it did the shower was great. Staff were very polite and helpful. We felt very safe as there was a door between the reception area and the access to the rooms which was kept locked from early evening. Our bedding and towels were changed every day!! room was very clean. We would most certainly go back, it was excellent value for money and the location was brilliant !!!

Booked the property for the price - an awesome price for New Years Eve! Room was clean, the furniture was worn - there were no bathroom issues - got in and out as needed. We had a double room (single bed) with the shared facilities. I would do this one again! On the second day we had another couple in the room next to us and you could hear their TV. Ohh yea the TV - it was one that I remember as a kid, this one had a remote control - it was full color and worked well - we had cable - I was impressed with that for some reason.... A little secret - no need to use the elevator (it is slow) their is a set of stairs at the end of the hallway. Staff was polite - they buzz you in at night so it is secure. Starbucks on the corner!

I stayed there with my sister and we booked a private double/double room, which meant that we had our own bathroom.
