As with most places there are positive and negative attributes. Let's start with the positive! The Hotel location worked out fine for us. The bakery on the corner and the grocery store across the street were convenient but I do wish the bakery had coffee. We got coffee on a tray from the hotel bar and it cost 10E. I also liked that it was a residential neighborhood so we could get a feel for everyday parisian life. There is a school and park close by too.The walk to the Eiffel Tower was just 10 minutes and nice to stroll through the park around it. We did rack up some high taxi fares though to get to and from parts of the city but I'm not sure any other hotel would be different. We liked the L'Open Bus Tour which left from the Eiffel Tower. The exterior of the hotel was beautiful and our room (#406) was clean and efficient. We always got good service and it was quiet. The negatives were the room size, a bit small but fine for three nights.

After reading the reviews on here I wasn't sure what to expect. I agree with some but then I disagree with others. We stayed 3 nights and I thoroughly enjoyed it! This hotel is in a great location to visit the monuments/land marks you would want to see in Paris. The walk to the Eiffel Tower is literally 5mins. There are m any places to eat along the main road the hotel is just off of. A great bakery on the main road, on a corner. Definitely would reccommend! It has pink decor and pink chairs outside...look out for it. The breakfast is from 7:30-10:30am which is great as one day we woke up early and could go and get breakfast and then another day we woke up later and relaxed in bed for a bit and still had time to go and get breakfast. There's a selection of meat, cheeses, bread, crossants and cereals. Our breakfast came with our room as we went through a site that done a package deal. The room was a decent size, quite big I thought. Comfy beds, lots of space in the wardrobe. A safe that you choose the code to store your valuables. Clean room. The cleaner that cleaned the rooms everyday was very friendly and kind even though we spoke little French. You get lovely white towels supplied and dressing gowns and slippers. The only thing that wasn't as good as I thought was when we arrived, our room wasn't ready, we arrived at 5pm and check in was meant to be any time from 3pm. The lady we checked in with was friendly but the other man wasn't and complained about us in French as our room was made up as a twin room when we asked for a double. They just said to push the beds together which meant it was easy to fall down the middle and we had two single duvets. In the morning we asked if we could change rooms, the man on the reception desk was very lovely and said that was absolutely fine and apologised. Problem was solved and our next nights sleep were very comfortable. I would recommend this hotel. I wouldn't quite say it was 4 star but it is clean and comfortable and the majority of the staff are very friendly and so helpful.

We booked straight from the hotel website and got a 50% discount. Parking was possible in a nearby supermarket parking for 15 euro per night (which in Paris is good value). Note: per night means only after six o'clock at night you pay another 15 euro. As we stayed one night we could leave the car parked until far in the afternoon which was enough for us to explore Paris a little more. Now the hotel itself is nicely decorated and I would say a four star boutique hotel. We did miss the bathrobe and the tea and coffee making facilities but then again this is continental Europa :-). We booked a classique room which was on par to Parisian standards: small but large enough to not feel uncomfortable. The tv was good although it had a mostly French channel selection (we didn't mind that). The hotel offers breakfast, roomservice and a minibar but we didn't make use of it so it is hard to rate (prices are what you can expect in a four star hotel in Paris: on the high end). The staff was friendly and helpful although there was only one staff member who spoke well enough English. She also helped us making reservations for a restaurant. The location is good and actually although we have been many times to Paris we never stayed in this part of the city. We liked it a lot and next time we will book a hotel (perhaps this one) in this area again. The metro stop is just a five minutes walk away from the hotel. Around this metro station there are many interesting shops, restaurants and bars. Also (at least one sunday) there is a lovely market.

The room was larger than expected given the reputation Paris has for small hotel rooms. Our room had a little balcony facing out to the front of the hotel, no great view but still felt like a nice feature. The toiletries in the room were L'Occitane, and if you are a beauty product fan like me you will know this is top quality stuff! I was quite excited about this...not everyone cares about these things I understand! If you\u2019re a girl like me you might ;-) I have to say I\u2019m a little puzzled by the previous review regarding the bathroom as I thought ours was quite modern and there was certainly nothing to complain about. Maybe other travellers are used to staying in the Ritz or some other mega fancy place but by our standards Le Marquis was pretty plush. Breakfast was buffet style, with a choice of your usual continental fayre but there was also bacon, sausages and scrambled eggs and a choice of making your own boiled eggs. The croissants, pancakes, pain au chocolat etc were all yum. A great way to start your busy day sightseeing. The one drawback is that there is no tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms, however if you fancy a cuppa when you get back to the hotel the reception staff are more than happy to make you a fresh pot to either have up in your room or in the lounge.

The \"reception\" of the hotel was basically an office desk manned by a very studious-looking young man who was so absorbed in what he was doing, he failed to even greet us when we first walked into the hotel. Overall, I think the staff should have been more friendly and welcoming. Despite this, the service provided was generally very good and I really enjoyed my stay here.

All I ever here is people complaining about the size of the rooms... unfriendly people... noisy locations. Ignore them! France is about busy nights, lots of bed wrestling and eating nice food/getting tipsy. People who are looking for a hotel to spend the whole holiday in are insane! ~Rant over Hotel~ Booked this hotel with the misconception it would be 'run-down', 'manky' etc. but on arrival it was beautiful. Very clean. The staff were helpful, although they are quietly spoken. I took my own case because i am not an invalid or royalty. We got to the room and were suprised at how nice it was. It's got a nice low light that gives a nice atmosphere. It is small. Bathroom is nice, the bath is small however and could fit me and my lass in but it we're below 6ft. The bedroom was cleaned thoroughly and it was refreshing every night we returned. We did not have breakfast or do any room service because we're penny pinchers. Location~ Nice quiet location, supermarket. Cafe's all over the place which aren't too pricey. Eiffel tower is walking distance (7-10 minutes). Holiday~ We pre booked Eiffel tower meal \u00a3150 i think. Really worth it, gorgeous food and champagna ;-). Girlfriend liked it, got engaged and everything. We took a bus tour...expensive but worth it to get to the most important parts. You must check out the 'latin quater'- might not be called that. We also did an evening bike tour with 'fat tyre tours' or something sounding similar. I thought I'd be gay doing cycling but it wasn't at all. Part of a group, seeing a lot of France and guided by friendly Yankee doodles. They take you on the river with complimentary wine. Overall it's really best for couples, short breaks (not a fortnight...unless your bill gates). We couldn't of have a better time. Always tell the irritating beggars to bog off. There's annoying gypsy women that winge at you and black geezers that try to sell bric-a-brack. Girlfriend paid 10 euro for a string braclet- she's not the street wisest of cats lol. Last advice..book everything with the likes of Thomas cook, France Airways etc. The shuttles ran perfect! We did not have one single hick up.

I did not have any trouble with the lift size, but then I did not take huge suitcases.4 average sized guests can fit in it. Sure, it is not massive, but this is an old building, so you cannot expect an industrial sized lift. The only negative point; walls are quite thin-take ear plugs if you have amorous neighbours!

The level of noise was high: we could hear people parting in the room across the hallway at 3 a.m so clearly that we had to complain to the reception about it, the second source of noise was a dated air conditioning system that produced a very annoying burping sound every second minute.

The rooms are spacious, and are decorated in a contemporary style which I found to be very pleasant.

On the ground level there is a small bar which also serves breakfast (not included in the room rate. but not excessively expensive by comparison with the prices in nearby cafes). There is also a lounge with comfortable chairs and even English-language newspapers. The hotel is situated just next to the Village Suisse, an antiques center well-known in Paris, and about a 5-minute walk from two metro lines and two bus lines. It is also about a 10-minute walk from UNESCO, the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization. The rue Dupleix is a quiet side street, and consequently, even the rooms on the street side of the hotel are quiet at night. There is a supermarket just across the street where one can find fruits, beverages and snack items without having to deal (in French) with the local merchants.

The hotel is in a central, yet quiet district of Paris right by the Effel Tower - offering a modern, contemporary styling combined with an artistic touch. It is fair to say the central location of the hotel is perfect for sight seeing tours of most of the Paris tourist spots as well as going further afield to Versailles or Disneyland. The hotel is literally 3 minutes walk from the foot of the Eiffel Tower and only a couple of minutes from a main Metro interchange station. Best place to explore for evening meals are down Rue Suffran towards the Metro station (Motte) away from the hotel as the prices increase as you got towards the Eiffel Tower... There is a very useful mini-mart supermarket opposite the hotel to stock up with provisions and drinks if you need to.

First night I was charged 250 Euro (about 340 USD), and the other two 225 Euro (about 306 USD). The other 3 nights I was charged 150 Euro (about 204 USD) for one and 130 Euro (about 177 USD) for the other two. The grand total was 1,935 Euro (about 2,635 USD). Positives: A lady at the front desk at check-in made sure I had reservations taken care of and everything was fine going forward with my stay in Paris. The same front desk person made all my reservations that I asked for and then some. She was tremendously helpful on all accounts of making sure I got things reserved that I wanted reserved and even suggested other places to dine or take into account. Front desk staff was very helpful calling for taxes if need to be picked up at the hotel. With only 35 rooms it feels more like an apartment then a hotel. Very personal touch to the hotel which you don\u2019t get at the bigger named hotels. Good size bed and overall felt pretty comfortable. The bath soaps and creams and what not were the brand L'Occitane which I thought was a nice touch. Room was cleaned everyday. Overall very clean looking hotel.

One elevator shared by all so some delay time some of the time getting from floor to floor. The location is great for the Eifel Tower (walking distance) but it is on a one-way road and in a weird position so taxis find it really hard to drop you off. But for some reason they find it to pick you up just fine so go figure. (Note on taxes. I traveled with four people so in Paris they charge for an extra person and also when you call for a taxi in Paris the time it takes them to get to you to pick you up they charge you for. Also taxis hate picking up four people. So this hotel is in a weird position so sometimes the charge is already at 6 to 8 euro before you get in it. My suggestion is take a stroll down to the street and hail a taxi unless you don\u2019t care about 6 to 8 euros). Charge for breakfast.

We were staying in room 304 and it looked like any hotel room in Paris (with 2 furry cushions!) The photos on their website are a little misleading. It's actually more modern than you might like.

This would have been so bad if he had not used the hotel's toilet facilites while we waited in reception and our meter was running outside. We were stunned, but didn't want to cause an argument as were running short on time. The taxi driver explained that because the hotel booked the taxi by phone that morning, the passenger must pay for the cost of the driver getting to the hotel. An opportunity for ripping people off if you ask me, it was already on 10 euros by the time we got in the back seat.

We loved the hotel for the following reasons:- - Small boutique hotel - Secure parking just across the road for \u00a310 per night (a definate bonus in Paris!) - Very clean and modern, beautiful decor and sumptious bed linen (very nice pillows!!) - Very Very quiet and in a great location just around the corner from the Eiffel Tower Our room was a superior room but was still quite small however we were really pleased with it (401). It was so quiet (we did have a room on the back of the hotel but it would still be quiet on the front) There was a little seating area and a dressing table plus a wardrobe but no drawers. The bathroom was compact but again everything was so new and clean that it didn't matter - the toiletries are fab! You even get robes and slippers - just remember to ask for them and they send them right up. We loved it and would definately stay there again.", "Date": "September 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery Good Hotel, location not so great\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3925210", "Content": "I paid 150 euros for a superior room, the room was big considering Paris hotels, very clean, nice decoration, great bed with not so great pillows, my room had a dvd player in the reception you can go for dvd at no cost. The bathroom was big although it didnt had a curtain but aside from that it had towel heater and was very good. The lobby offered good magazine aswelll as internet service ( 8 euros for 1 hour). the staff at the hotel were almost all the time very helpfull but one time that i asked for a taxi and it had arrived ten minutes eariler and they didnt bother telling me that the taxi had already arrived, generating 15 euros of a taxi i hadnt even taken. The location isnt the best for walking since its in calm residential area, theres not much to see, but you have the lamotte piquet metro station 3 minutes away, which is good or you can take a taxi for 6 euros to champss elysee, just remember the important streets suroounding the hotel because no taxi knows rue dupleix where the hotel is located, tell them to take you to lamotte piquet and suffren, then you guide them. Overall i really liked this hotel.", "Date": "September 20, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Le Marquis", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d290384-Reviews-Hotel_Le_Marquis-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$185 - $353*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">15 Rue Dupleix</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">15th Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75015</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "290384", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/5c/4e/5c4ea5121374ab5486e30e5215d992ee2large.jpg"}}
