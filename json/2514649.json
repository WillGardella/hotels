The bed however was extremely comfortable with lovely white linen and big fluffy white towels and our room including the bathroom was newly refurbished with a lovely power shower as per the pictures on their website. There was free wifi which was invalualbe to us planning our first NYC visit (me and my 16yr old daughter) from the comfort of our own room on our laptop. The only negative about the room apart from the size was the lighting. 3 side lights with no main lighting and a small window, made the room very dimly lit, although the bathroom lighting was very bright. Our first impression of the hotel was that it was smaller than we imagined and the reception area is pleasant although the corridors and the lift areas are in need of refurbishing but who sleeps in the corridor? There are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room and there is no on site restaurant for meals, snacks or room service although there is a Sushi restaurant within the same building. The staff were very friendly and accommodating and we took the hotel car back to the airport for a cost of $60 (inc toll) which was slightly more expensive than a cab but convenient as the hotel isn't on a main taxi route.

The location and price were my main reasons for choosing it, and it could not have been more convenient to my business needs (all in midtown) and to restaurants. There is a subway stop (blue line) just around the corner, plus red, yellow, and orange trains within 2-3 blocks' walk. Plenty of eating and bars extremely close by, and the price (in January) was fantastic. However, the overall quality could improve. The room was very small, which didn't bother me, but also very dark-- no overhead light, only two small lamps. The bathroom had ample light, and I often left the bathroom door open to better illuminate the room. Wasn't working in the room, so again, not a huge issue. My room was on the third floor facing the street, and on one night, there was significant street noise from a bar opposite. Drilling in the street directly outside starting at 9am on several mornings-- annoying, but not severe, since I was getting ready for work by then. Bed was great, very clean and comfortable. Bathroom amenities excellent. Soft towels changed daily. No intrusive housekeeping service, but always efficient. The hotel advertises a 24-hour fitness center, but half of the equipment was busted and unusable. Lock to hold the seat in place on the exercise bike was broken, and the treadmill had an out-of-sort, \"sorry for temporary unavailability\" sign on it for my entire stay. Were they making an effort to get it repaired at all? The free weight bench was not broken. Room was a bit cold the first night, but fine all the others. The staff were very friendly, helpful, and efficient. On the whole, I would stay here again if the price were in this range. Next time I might personally change the lightbulbs to make the room brighter, and I'll hope that weather permits exercise in the Park.

Rooms were nicely decorated though very small. There was actually no room to walk around the room with 2 luggage bags sitting together, the bags had to be opened on the bed. There was no minibar (switch I needed to store medication). A major issue with the room was the fact that we couldn't control the temperature. We were there in the middle of winter and had to leave the window open to cool the room down. It would be -10C outside but 40C inside. We complained to reception about it but there was nothing they could do as there was one control for the whole hotel and the hotel was completely booked out. Bathroom is also small with only a sink, shower and toilet. I found it a little hard to wash my hair because the shower was so small as I lifted my arms I'd hit the side of the shower. This hotel is in an excellent location and is walking distance to Times Square and a lot of other tourist sites. When we book our room we also bought vouchers to get breakfast every morning.

I stayed in two rooms during my visit due to a problem with the heating, so I think the rooms size is based on which side of the building you are on. If you are book in a room to the right of the front desk, that appears to be an older tower, so tiny rooms and tiny bathrooms. To the left of the front desk the room was much bigger, closer to standard size, as was the bathroom. The bathroom in the room on the left tower also included a jazzuzi tub. I did enjoy my stay at this property, they had thick bath towels, nice bath products, clean rooms and contemporary design. The staff was very accomodating, especially when we got back to the room at 1am and the heat seemed very low. They immediately came to fix it. When it was 2am and getting colder we called again and they brought a space heater to fix the situation and then called me back in the morning to advise that they were going to switch us to a new room because of the issues with the heater. Nice follow through, I didn't have to call to remind them. The location is perfect, a ton of great restaurants on 9th street and of course Time Square on 7th.

Best homemade Italian food I've had in a long time. Ate every bite! Overall, this hotel is clean, you get your own bathroom (you never know in NYC), and the beds are pretty comfy. The rooms are small, but we weren't picky about that at all. We were barely in the room anyways. The only gripe we had was that it was warm in there and the blinds would not stay up. But we cranked the AC or opened the window and it was fine. I thought the staff were nice. Valet parking is questionable. I say this only because I got my car back and it appeared that my radio had been played with. The time and settings were off. I didn't like that very much, but still not a huge deal. It also took them a while to bring my car to me when we checked out. However, I was glad to get my car back damage free.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cSmall Wonder\u201d", "Author": "2SunSisters", "ReviewID": "UR121101864", "Content": "I stayed at the Washington Jefferson Hotel for 3 nights for business. It was a great location because it was near my work location, Times Square, the subway and there were several restaurants and bars literally all around it. The hotel is a boutique hotel and the young woman at the front desk was a little cold but professional, so this was more than acceptable. She told me I was upgraded from the standard queen I booked and as you can imagine I was delighted. I proceeded to the old elevator and found it charming to watch the gate open and close. I exited on the 3rd floor and proceeded down a narrow hallway. I am no stranger to small spaces because I lived in NY for a decade, but was shocked when I entered my room. The door almost touched the bed when I opened the door wide enough to get my suitcase through it. The space was well used as there was a queen size bed, desk and mini wardrobe in a very tight space. The flat screen tv was mounted on the wall behind the door. I swear, I had a minor attack of claustrophobia so I decided to go the store and get some staples then return. On the way out, I asked the cold front desk clerk about the square footage and she told me \u201cthis is a boutique hotel\u201d. After I confirmed I was aware of this, she told me the square footage was 260. I told her there was no way and asked her to find out before I returned. Upon returning, someone from facilities told me it was 180 square feet. That seemed more like it. After I returned to the room and checked out the rest of the room. The bed was chic looking but it was very hard. There was one mattress and there was no real cushion, but I must admit I didn\u2019t really have a problem sleeping during my stay. The highlight of the stay was the bathroom. It was beautiful. Definitely, well designed, beautiful tiles and surprisingly quite spacious. I suggest they start showing pictures of the bathroom on the website, because it might make the stay worthwhile. I also want to note that the only cold person was the young lady who checked me in. Everyone else was very friendly throughout the stay.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jakarta, Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "Bellesister", "ReviewID": "UR120572348", "Content": "This is my first trip to New York city and I didn't really know the areas well but from the reviews that i read about this hotel, it has a good location and quite good priced at that time so I chose this hotel.

I was however left disappointed on arrival. There were some positives, but many negatives which were almost entirely borne out of an expectation set by the hotel, and avoidable. Positives - (these will be les detailed than the negtives, but not because they are less important) - Location was great. Only 10 mins from Times Sq, probably less, similar to Columbus circle and Central Park, and close to 2 Subway lines that both go all the way to the financial district without changing. It was far enough off however to avoid a lot of the noise and allow for a good night sleep. - Close to lots of little diners, some restaurants of all standards, coffee shops, and the house of brews for a last drink on the way home. - Rooms cleaned and re-made everyday with nice bathroom toiletries Negatives - The staff were very friendly in themselves, but their service was not as professional as it could have been. For example, on check in our room wasn't ready (at 3pm), and after 5 minutes waiting to find out how long it would be - so we could nip out for coffee - it suddenly was ready. This was a needless situation for a customer to see. This theme continued throughout our stay. - The lift had a heavy iron door on, like something out of a warehouse. I expected a cage lift to appear the other side. - There were office spaces to the left of the recpetion that was not sympathetically designed. Not a problem in itself, but not what you expect from a 3 1/2 star hotel. They have tried to retain some NY feel, but there are obvious areas that have been saved on. - No hotel bar, almost inexcusable, but no tea/coffee facilities or water in the rooms which is inexcusable. - Radiator with no function to turn off. I understand it is winter, but to have to use Air Con (that smelled like it had not been used/serviced) to cool down an artificially heated room seems ridiculous - Room was small and again whilst not in itself a problem, is only really suitable for 2 nights due to storage. - Furniture looked old and dated. This is one of the areas where i feel something had to be saved. In general, this hotel appeared to shoehorn in all the requirements to get its star rating - it has a 3 piece suite in reception a hairdryer and a bag to send laundry out for example. I just question what would have happened if i had actually used the bag. I get the feeling it was there for the star - but they hoped no-one would use it - and if they did it would be a clunky process. The problem is possibly within the rating system itself. There is a perception of 3 star, the decor, the greeting, the service, none of which can be measured and therefore the actual star is given on other things that can be measured. This hotel has either a) got it horribly wrong and believes that it has created a 3 star environment or b) done everything to get the 3 star and not concerned itself with what is perceived to be 3 star. There are other hotels around that are better at the same price point or similar but cheaper. I would not recommend this hotel unless you get a much better rate. I paid $250 per night (as part of a package) and consider this much too expensive. Overall, the trip was good and the hotel did not detract from this, but i wont stay there again. I apologise for the lack of any photo's, this was the first place we've ever been where there was simply no point in taking any. These are only my opinions, so please take them or leave them - i've only talked about things that are important to me as a customer and been as honest as I could.

They were very attentive at all times, and even gave us a late check out when we told them our flight was mid-afternoon -Price, pretty reasonable for the location Negatives: - Room size, our room was pretty small, but this was because the bed was a King size and so didn't leave room for much else! Let's just say we had to be creative to get our cases open - Street noise, the air conditioning unit is attached to the bottom part of the window by way of a plastic screen where the glass should be. This means that street noise gets in very easily. The noise bothered us quite a bit on the first night, but we began to get used to it. If this is likely to bother you, I would ask for a room that doesn't look out onto West 51st street Overall, if you're the type of person that prefers a modern hotel with amenities etc then you should probably look elsewhere.

Enter the reviews of the Washington Jefferson Hotel in Manhattan, New York. We booked this Hotel for a seven day stay in the Big Apple recently largely based once again on Trip Advisor reviews of the property. As I \"escaped\" from this dreadful establishment after 24 hours, going to a nearby property that was actually slightly better value and as different as New York is from Kabul, that action will probably give members some idea of what awaits them in this establishment. When one arrives you are met with the Reception area. This contains several sets of some of the dirtiest net curtains I have ever seen anywhere in the world. Ok the Reception Staff are friendly enough but why should they not be when one is paying approx 370 US Dollars a night to stay in their shoeboxes of rooms. We opted for a standard room and realised that in New York that meant a small box with bed but we could not believe our eyes, when we actually arrived in this bijou space. There is a cheap bed surrounded by approx a 1/2 metre wide path over an old and dirty piece of carpet. One side of the bed would be within a half metre to the small window which looked out onto an internal courtyard which reminded me of some pictures I have seen of old Victorian jails. The air conditioning unit was emitting an awful noise and we complained within seconds of being shown to our cell, sorry I mean standard room. The unit was surrounded by one of the cleanest things in the room, which was a white tea towel, which appeared to prevent rain from seeping in the space that was present should the towel have been removed. There was a \"wardrobe\" which was approx 2 metres in height and may have allowed one guest to hang up a change of clothes for a one day stay. It looked as though it had been built by a small child. But wait, nothing could have prepared us for the racket the air conditioning unit made all night long which prevents the notion of sleeping entirely. We complained but nothing could be done. In fact we complained to the Management within 30 minutes of arriving as I could not believe that even in New York someone could have the audacity to charge 370 dollars a night for the pleasure of squeezing into this tiny space and not being able to sleep a wink all night. Now several other reviewers have mentioned the well appointed slate walled bathroom. The shower seals were covered in mould and it had the added design facility that when one was standing in the shower and was male by gender it would have been possible to use the faucet without moving out of the shower. The image on Trip Advisor does not in my opinion portray the condition of the actual room you have the pleasure of paying nearly 400 dollars per night to inhabit. We were offered the possibility after two nights of moving to an \"upgraded room\" with the added cost of 70 dollars a night for this dubious pleasure. We lasted one night and made our farewells deciding that we would rather cut our holiday short and fly home than spend one other night in this absolute rip-off of a Hotel. The reviews suggest that this is a dated but budget priced Hotel. Well I can assure anybody else that there are several 4 star Hotels within a 1/2 mile of this establishment that offer luxury accommodation for the same price and I would not recommend this Hotel to anyone unless they obtain a rate of less than 150 dollars per night. If this place has been updated I would hate to have seen it in its previous incarnation. I find it difficult to be objective in my description of this place. For the rate being charged it is an absolute disgrace and my sympathy goes out to anyone else who has the misfortune to have been duped by both the images and description of this establishment.

This was no problem for us. The bed was comfortable and we had no issue with noise at all, which, along with cleanliness, is the major issue when we book a hotel room. So, on the noise and cleanliness scales, we were pleased. Location-wise, well, very close to Times Square if this is what floats your boat. Times Square holds no particular interest for us and the food options within this general area are touristy, however, it's a central area and easy to get anywhere, so again, not a bad area at all. Speaking of food, we enjoyed going to a BBQ restaurant called Daisy May's and this was absolutely brilliant. In fact, the BBQ food was as good, if not better than some of the BBQ places we went to in the south of America, later on. Interweb was free too...so, that was great.

The purpose of our trip was to vacation in New York, taking in the sights and attractions. This hotel is in a great location and lends itself to doing a \"little bit of everything\" included Times Square, Broadway, Central Park, and is on the major route of the hop on/hop off bus tours which I recommend as a way to see the rest of New York. First of all, it's important that I mention how I came to book this property. I used Hotwire and was near confident I was getting a Hilton property but ended up getting this one. After reading up about the hotel, including numerous reviews on this sight, I was expected an average hotel, small rooms with good service. For the most part, that is what I got, but I should point out the following. This hotel is in need of some work, particularly in common areas such as hallways, elevators and stairwells. We checked in and inquired about an upgrade and was told they were giving us a \"premium - which was very nice\". I didn't recall premium being listed on the WJ website as an option. We took the elevator to the 2nd floor which is what I would describe as 30 year olds and in need of replacing (see photos). When we got the second floor, it was clear that the place needed some work (again, see photos). When we got into our room, I was shocked. Picture a queen bed, and picture at most, 1-2 feet around the bed and that was the perimeter of the room. VERY small. The biggest issue with the room was the way the air conditioning unit was installed. It was installed in the window, and on either side of the unit there was cardboard/paper which basically meant it was exposed to the outside. This meant the room, which faced 51st street was VERY noisy. We did not sleep at all. The following morning, I done something I have never done before and asked for a new room. I have to say, the front desk staff were very helpful and when we returned home from a day out, we were given a room on the 4th floor which did not face 51st street. This room was more spacious and acceptable for a week's stay. The only issue with this room was that the air conditioning unit did not work at all. It was a very hot and humid week in New York, so our room was like a SAUNA. However, again, when this was pointed out to hotel staff, it was fixed within a day or so, and we were given a special gift in room for our trouble. In closing, if you are looking for a low priced hotel room which is centrally located, this may be an option worth exploring. However, have a look at my photos so you'll know what to expect in terms of the room and the property overall. The lobby is really nice. The rooms are average, with little storage space for a long term stay. I would compare the size of the rooms to that of a cruise ship. The main issue is how dated the rest of the hotel is, including the stairwell and the elevator. With all of the available options in New York City, I would have to say I would not stay here again.", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value!\u201d", "Author": "Snapplegirl68", "ReviewID": "UR108213098", "Content": "I stayed at this hotels recently, as I was going to see a Broadway show.

We were given a city guide and a recommendation for where to get a light dinner.

We asked for extra pillows and were given them immediately, the reception staff were helpful on the few occasions we needed assistance. Would highly recommend this hotel to people coming to NYC for the fist time, or who want to be close enough to Times Square to feel involved but not too close to have it impact on your sleep.

Positives: 1. The location is unbeatable. -Times Sq is a short stroll from the hotel -There are great restaurants/Cafes on 8th & 9th Ave' sat the end of the street. - Subway is literally a minute walk from the hotel, but we rarely used it anyway finding it easy enough to walk most places despite the snow! 2. Staff are very professional and helpful. A shout out to housekeeping who do a brilliant job. 3. Price was reasonable for its location and time of year. Negatives: 1. HEATING!! This was our major downfall. The heating is centrally controlled and being on an upper level our room was absolutely boiling at night so much so we had the bedroom and bathroom windows fully open, despite it being below freezing outside. Very dehydrating! 2. Our bed was rock hard, it was literally a mattress on what looked like a plank of wood. Weird at first but after a long day sight-seeing we soon learned to zonk out on it! 3. Pillows were hollow and lumpy offering no support. (I should have probably asked for different ones). 4. Rooms were on the smallish side but not as bad as people have spoken about on here - its New York you make do!! Overall I would still recommend it. We had a substantial stay at the hotel and I was a little disappointed we didn't get any sort of recognition of that in terms of additions/specials.

The bad points: - Rooms are TINY. - Beds are hard. - Rooms at the front of the property are VERY noisy due to poor sound proofing from the street. - The first room we were in was too warm, and we had no control over the heating. - No dining facilities on site, so you have to go out for breakfast. The good points: - Location is good - close to Times Square, but not so close that it's a nuisance. Also very close to a subway station on the A, C and E lines. - Staff were helpful in moving us to a slightly larger room that was quieter (near the back of the property). - Relatively cheap. Overall, we expected better, and I wouldn't call this a 3 star hotel. A little more detail: On the first night, we asked to be moved to a larger room, and for some padding to be put on the bed (it was like a plank of wood). They said they couldn't do anything until the morning, as the house keeper had gone home and there were no larger rooms available until the next day. In the morning, we checked with them and they said they had a larger room available (at the expense of having a smaller bathroom), which was also quieter (we complained about the noise in the morning, having been constantly woken up in the night be people & vehicles outside). They moved our stuff whilst we were out for the day. The second room we were in had a bit more space, but the bathroom was tiny (barely room to dry yourself). Happily though, it was away from the road so much quieter, and they'd put a bit of padding on the bed so it was slightly more bearable. The radiators weren't on in the room for some reason, so it was also a more comfortable temperature. I certainly wouldn't recommend this hotel, as it's pot luck which room you end up with.

The location as others have said is perfect for getting around the city and with the Theatre district on the doorstep you can take good advantage of the TKTS in Times Square for cheap tickets. I recommend Rock of Ages, a great show in an intimate theatre with a great company. We ate in the Cosmic Diner and Ellens Stardust Diner and found both to be reasonable value ( for New York! ) but for a blowout lunch head to the Dallas BBQ on 42nd Street ( Opposite Ripleys ) excellent value and a bucket of drink for the price of a normal glass.

THE ROOM: We stayed in Room 231 - Superior King - with jacuzzi. I have attached a couple of pictures of the room. I requested a quiet room and it was quiet. Room 231 faces the inner courtyard. We heard no traffic noise, but once in a while someone would be in the courtyard talking on their cell phone...and we could hear their end of the conversation clearly, even with the windows closed. The room was spacious and clean. It had a love seat, desk and chair, nightstand, flat panel TV and a real closet with real hangers. The closet housed the small room safe (big enough to fit our netbook). We used the Ipod docking station. Bed linens were clean & inviting. The love seat had a fold out bed, although I don't think there was enough room to fold it out without having to move furniture around. We did check for bedbugs near the headboard and in the drawers of the desk & nightstand. None found! We had no problems with the mattress (we like a firm mattress).

There were enough electrical outlets in the room so that we could charge batteries to our 2 cell phones and 2 cameras all at the same time. THE BATHROOM: I have attached a picture.

There was plenty of room for us to place our toiletries on the shelf below the sink. We did not use the Jacuzzi. There was a phone & hair dryer in the bathroom also. SERVICE - the front desk was friendly and efficient. The lamp on the nightstand was broken. Without being asked, they fixed it the next day.

The room was very cosy for two people with two suitcases. The washroom is petite but the extras were amazing! Flat screen tv on the wall, iPOD docking station/alarm clock, desk, small armoire, comfy bed and extremely comfy linens and an AC unit!!! We absolutely loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Be warned it is an old building so the hallways are narrow and the elevator is TINY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I mean two people and two suitcases (max) tiny!!! It is a short walk to Times Square and there is also a subway stop not even a block away (right at 51st street and 8th ave). If would like to get some wine for your room, there is a liquor store on 8 avenue south of 51st street on the east side of the street. Warning: If you are Canadian, they don't sell beer / liquor in the same store. Wine and liquor is sold in the \"liquor\" store and beer is sold in the drug stores and other pharmacy like places. Duane Reid is the big chain and if I remember correctly there is one close to the hotel. If you want some nice little eateries, walk on 51st over the 9th avenue. Both ways (north and south) there are lots of great places. For a quick and cheap breakfast go to Renaissance 99 on 9th ave north of 51st street. Word of advice - if you want to really see NYC without 100's of people in your way - DO NOT GO AT THE END OF AUGUST!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have been to NYC two other times - once during the month of May and once during the month of September - both better times to visit! TIPS FROM MY EXPERIENCES IN NYC: 1 - The subway is a fabulous way to get around the city! It is a bit scary the first time you attempt to figure out where you are going but once you do = look out! It is amazing! It is $2.00 a ride but you get can ride cards from the machines inside the station. Also, take the time to figure out what line and what train to be on. We learned this the hard way. There are 'express' trains and 'local' trains. The express train only stops at certain stops even though it lists all the stops and the line map. 2 - Want an amazing mexican restaurant and an amazing experience? Check out La Esquina in SOHO. 3 - Times Square - Great for photos and to experience it but it is way tooooo crowded and frustrating with all the people! 4 - Look at the crosswalk signs before crossing the street. People don't seem to wait until the light changes in NYC. They just walk across the street - it is a drivers worst nightmare. You can easily get caught in the flow of the crowd and you are so busy looking around you don't realize you are walking thru moving traffic!!!!!!!! 5 - Don't take the HOP ON/HOP OFF red bus by Grayline. A waste of money when it is busy. If you get on for a loop, make sure you have LOTS of time AND you don't plan on hopping off b/c if you start with a top level seat you won't get one again after the first stop! Horrible service and if you are on the bottom level it isn't worth it! Walking/subway is a better way to get around! 6 - Taxi's - take them! Super cheap and super fast!!!!!!! 7 - If you don't know the city, make sure you get a really good map of the city. We had to ask a few new yorkers how to find subway stops and liquors stores and they couldn't tell us anything!!!!!!!!!! 8 - Century 21 - if you have lots of patience and time to stand in crowds, do it but otherwise it is a head ache. 9 - Magnolia Bakery (from SATC) - ok cupcakes - not that great and after the bull&#(% you go thru to get into store and get your cupcakes really not worth it! You have to stand in line to get in and then once you get in, the area where the cupcakes are is about 6'x6' and women turn into monsters when they are in there! We ended up getting pushed around and getting covered in icing b/c we were being polite and standing to get our cupcakes in the same order that we entered the store - UM NO! It seems it is a free for all to get cupcakes once you are in!!!!!!! 10 - Check out greenwich / soho / west village area - great art vendors!!!!", "Date": "August 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando", "Title": "\u201cBad room, Worse Management\u201d", "Author": "zzzchase", "ReviewID": "UR18507545", "Content": "Got to the room and the WINDOW a/c unit, (yes they have window units!) wasn't working.

We have stayed at the Washington Jefferson three times w/ 3 different room types. The standard with a queen bed is very small, so I would spend a little more for the deluxe. If you are going cheap, you can't complain if you end up with a small room. We have also stayed in the 2 twins which was big enough for my husband and I. We booked a deluxe w/ 2 twins, this last time, and found once we arrived that we had been upgraded to a deluxe with 2 queens (room 336) which was very roomy. The rooms which face 51st are kind of noisy, so you may want to ask for a room on the back side. Although, keep in mind you will only have a view of the other side of the building. The hotel is a block from the A,C,and E line which will just about take you just about anywhere (Central Park and Time Square are one stop away). You can also take this line to Canal Street and South Street. Rockefeller and St. Patricks are 3-4 blocks away. The E line will also take you to Jamaica Station which is linked to JFK by the airtrain. Found that we could get to and from the airport in 45 min for $14 a piece rather than around $60 by taxi. The hotel will also hold your luggage if you arrive before check-in at 3, or after check-out at 12. The beds aren't like home, but I haven't stayed in that aren't that comfortable.

Also, despite the hard mattress, the soft headboard made sitting on the bed a little more tolerable and the blankets and sheets were of good quality. Other small complaints are that our headboard was right against someone else's door which slams uncontrollably, waking us up multiple times throughout our stay. The window had a view only of the brick wall of the next building, and the air conditioner (which wouldn't have to work too hard to cool such a small room) is right at the foot of the bed, making it a little hard to regulate the temperature while sleeping.

So we decided to book a hotel within walking distance to the Gershwin Theater. We were tired at staying at all the chain hotels, so we decided to book this independent one, It ws fantastic. First off, After I had booked it, I needed to contact the hotel via email to make sure the reservation i made on the hotels website went through (a step I recommend for anyone booking any hotel)I had an instant email back with my reservation and a personal message welcoming me, I had asked about the complimentery wireless access, as even though on vacation i had to work :(. they explained that the hotel did have wireless, but if it was slow, there was a backup T1 line if needed. Awesome, After a cabbie ripped us off, charging 25 dollars from NY Penn station to 51st, we were in no mood for trouble, Well, when we checked in the Front desk agents were professoinal, nice and very efficient at their job, we had room keys in 3 minutes. We had come up from Pennsylvania by train, during the first major snowstorm of the year. and i had the flu.they understood we were cold, wet, tired and aggitated at the aforementioned cabbie, that we were able to check in early. The room was beutiful, we booked a Superior King with a jacuzzi, the room was NOT small at all, it was very clean, nicely decorated with fine lines and a fresh rose on the nightstand. the bathroom was beautiful, all travertine tile and a platform jacuzzi was just what i needed, in the desk drawers there was plenty of information on what to do in the city, they even printed up the hotels own book about where to go and eat and what to do, it was awesome and very hepful. There is the cosmic diner accross the street, went to run a jacuzzi bath and my girlfrend ordered me some chicken soup at the same time, the diner delevered it even before the tub was done filling, thats how fast they were. We ate at the hotel restaurant schmizu that night, top notch, awesome service in this small, quaint restaurant. I highly recommed the prix fare dnner! Afterward we spoke with London the Concierge about what to do in the nighttime, he not only recommended some hot spots, but sent us to Coyote Ugly and the village, we had a blast, he really knows his stuff! Seek him out at all costs, he even wrote down more ideas for us and delevered them right to our room! We ended up renting a limo for the night to see the town and do the things he recommended. The next day we walked the few short blocks to the theater, enjoyed Wicked and then walked around a little, THIS HOTEL is SO centrally located, you can walk to almost everything in the Theater District and Times square! Basically, I know this is a lot of ranting and raving, but ignore most of the other neg. reviews, true, walls are thin as it is an older hotel, but it was worth every penny and the staff was great and should be commended for their professionalism for 2 girls, one very sick, for the duration of our stay, I will be back to stay there again, you can bet on it!!!

And initially, the size of the room didn't seem to be an issue because we didn't plan on spending much time there. However, after a few days, it was pretty inconvenient not to have a place to just sit down and chill out (not to mention the fact that there is basically nowhere to put luggage/clothes except for a tiny bedside closet). The other major inconvenience was the noise level at night, which consisted primarily of garbage men throwing and breaking glass. The room was clean and the linens were nice but not enough to make up for the lack of sleep or space. The icing on the cake was finding out after checking out that our room rate would have been hundreds of dollars cheaper if we had made our reservation over the phone instead of online. Even so, it was cheaper than most other hotels in the area but you should at least know why before booking! One more thing, the room didn't have an adjustable thermostat and got VERY hot, had to keep the window open or cracked most of the time.

There are lots of really good reastaurant within walking distance from the hotel that are really good value Our room was small however it wasn't an issue as we didn't spend much time in the hotel only to sleep. However there was a horrendous smell in the corridor outside our room which seemed to come from the rooms down the hall. There appears to be people living in the hotel which was very strange!! and one of them liked to play her music a full volume late at night We tried to use the internet from our room one morning and it wasn't working properly and was incredibly slow so we reported it to the reception and asked them to have the connection charge removed from our bill. We had to deal with 3different people before this charge was removed as the initial two staff refused to remove the charge as they said that their records said that we were connected for 30minutes. We found the staff to be extremely unpleasant when dealing with this issue and their customer service skills are rubbish The room itself while small was nicely decorated and had a flat screen tv on the wall. The bathroom while also very small had a good power shower. We also selected this hotel as it advertised that it had a gym however this consisted of a tiny room with a treadmill and little else....so not my definition of a gym.

We paid $177 a night through Priceline. The hotel is located on 51st St between 8th & 9th Aves which is a great location, there are many delis, Duane Reeds (NYC drug store) & restaurants with in walking distance; Times Square is about a block or 2 away. There is also a subway stop one block from the hotel. The front desk staff were professional & friendly; they offered us a map of the area & a complimentary copy of the New York Times upon check-in. I\u2019ve stayed in many NYC hotels & I must say this was probably the smallest room I\u2019ve stayed in yet. However, it was clean with modern d\u00e9cor & fine for me & my husband. The room had a nice flat screen TV on the wall, a desk, & a mini armoire/closet which also contained a safe, an iron & board, & 2 shoe mitts. The queen size bed was comfortable; however the outside noise level was very high. Our room was facing 51st street which provided a nice view of the quaint street below, however, due to the window mounted air conditioner, it sounded like a window was open but they were all closed. This wasn\u2019t a big issue to us because we\u2019re used to city noise but for those who are not, it will probably be a big issue. A few of the nice room features were an iPod dock on the nightstand and copies of New York IN magazine & Time Out New York magazines which list all of the goings on for the week in NYC. Complementary in-room internet service was also provided. Wireless was supposed to be available but every time we tried to connect to the wireless we had problems logging on, we even asked the front desk who referred us to the service providers customer service line which was unable to help us. We were however, able to connect using the wall connection cable in the room (cables are in the desk drawer in the room). The bathroom was VERY small, but again, it was clean with modern d\u00e9cor. The stand up shower had good water temperature & pressure. Complementary bath products included Gilchrist & Soames Forest Essentials shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, body wash, facial soap, oatmeal bath soap, shower cap, & a little kit containing cotton balls, q-tips & a nail file. I found the sink to be a bit awkward; the faucet was rather large & right in the middle of the sink so it got in the way when washing ones face. The Washington Jefferson hotel is a nice hotel in a great location however, due to the small room size I most likely would not stay there again or recommend it to others (unless the price is right). While in NYC I would recommend having lunch at S\u2019mac in the East Village (345 E. 12th St between 1st & 2nd Aves) it\u2019s a terrific neighborhood restaurant that serves different versions of mac & cheese.

I would describe it as a boutique hotel, but I was still pleasantly surprised when I arrived. The hotel is on 51st, between 8th and 9th in NYC. Before going to NYC, I had booked dinner reservations for each night at a few of my favorite restaurants. I knew I would have good karma for this stay when my driver pulled up to the hotel and I saw Maria Pia, my favorite Italian restaurant, right across the street. I had read reviews and expected a small room--what I always expect in NYC--but I had called ahead and upgraded to a deluxe room (at the nominal rate of $20 per night) so my room was quite adequate. (Come on folks, how much time to we actually spend in the room when we're in a city with so much to see and do!) Our king sized bed was firm and the bedding was extra nice. I wanted to take the duvet home with me! The bath was small but had everything I needed during my stay, including a window ledge to store my toiletries. Even though I did not have a tub (which I would have loved to soak my feet in at the end of a busy day), I did have a nice, hot shower with great water pressure. The linens were replaced every day, and the bathroom was always well stocked. While I didn't have much drawer space (just 4 small drawers in the desk), I did have a good sized closet, and I used space under the bed to store shopping bags and suitcases. I was most surprised at how quiet the room was. Our room overlooked a very clean \"courtyard\" which was formed by the shape of the hotel. When all was completely quiet, we could hear an occasional horn or siren from 8th or Broadway, but when we turned on the widow unit, we heard nothing. When it was too cold to run the AC, we simply turned on the fan and slept like babies. The hotel desk help was exceptional. We didn't stop by often, but when we did, we were always treated with respect and good humor. One morning when we were looking for a leisurely breakfast, we asked the doorman, who recommended the Sortie, right across the street. I highly recommend the restaurant with its quiet ambiance and wonderful crepes--both sweet and savory. I also have to mention the location. Just one block from a major subway line and two blocks from another, all of NYC is closeby. For those who don't mind walking, Penn Station, Central Park, and the Javits Convention Center are all within walking distance. (I actually enjoyed my walk to the Javits Center through Hells Kitchen.) When I showed my friend the city, we took the subway with its quick and easy access. At the end of each day--we were there 5 days--we were happy our hotel was so accessible since we had often walked miles in our excursions. Most theaters conveniently went on strike two days before my trip, and I was a bit apprehensive that my visit would be spoiled. But it wasn't. I simply regrouped and did new and interesting things that I would not normally have done--Radio City Music Hall's Christmas Spectucular, a walking tour of Central Park, a comedy club on the upper east side, Zabars on the upper west side, shopping in China Town on Saturday afternoon. NYC was as exciting as ever! If I get the chance to return to NYC, I will definitely stay at the Washington Jefferson again, especially if I get a Hotwire rate. (Hotwire often gives enough information for me to figure out where I'm staying. Just read between the lines in the reviews.) I hope you will, too.

Not at all large but, even with a king bed, roomy enough for the two of us to move around without a problem. It was also impeccably clean when we arrived and stayed that way. The amenities are fine and the internet access is highspeed and easily accessed. It's not a perfect place... the elevator is small and a little slow. The bathroom is proportionally even smaller and might not be comfortable for plus-size people but offered no serious challenge to my six foot plus/190 pound partner.

The sushi restaurant is also quite good (despite being a little expensive but well it's NYC...), so if you are looking for a great base to explore Manhattan this is your hotel!!

Imagine yourselve to be in the world stage of dialogue between all the World like you see it on your TV... - Statue of Liberty: Another extraordinary sight, just worthy of cruising by and taking loads of picture from Manhattan Island skyline - Brooklyn Bridge: Cross it by day and by night, to find the magic in Manhattan skyline that you only see in films - Grand Central - Beautiful Station, Incredible architecture - St.Patricks Cathedral - An oasis of spiritual peace and excellent architecture among hundreds of skyscrapers - Chinatown- An enriching in China away from China (great place for bargains). Unforgivable to miss it by daylight. - Wall Street: NYSE, Charging Bull, George Washington Museum, Old Church... a place with so many great landmarks - WTC - You can't help getting emotional in this tragic place, specially after visiting the small church near it... Finantial center views are outstanding from current construction site. - 5th Avenue & Broadway & Greenwich Vilage- Shoppers paradise!! BroadwayTheaters are very good but very overpriced... unless you love musicals!! - Times Square - The Jewel of the crown where you could spend hours and hours admiring all that nightlife: Hard Rock, Planet Hollywood, M&M World, Virgin, Gift Shops, Everything is there My final ecommendations are: - Have a minimum of 6 days to visit all of this and a few more if you like just to walk around - Invest in good restaurants (40-50 USD) 2 nights - Don't invest on city tours- Walk a lot and use a Metro system - Buy a Citypass to spare a lot of money for main attractions - Buy your gifts in Chinatown or Greenwich Village, much cheaper!! - Buy food in one of the hundreds of delicatessen shops to spare money to invest on the best attractions... quality is excellent! - Beware of all neighbourhoods at night, namely outside Manhattan... don't risk too much walking.

Because of this it was not sealed, and facing the street you can imagine the noise. I immediately called reception and asked to be move due to this air conditioner and the noise it allowed in from the street. They said they couldn't (it was only about 2 or 3pm, so I didn't really believe them). They called me back after about 10 mins and offered us a room facing a 'courtyard' on the ground floor. It was high enough above ground level not to concern me. The bathroom was nice (shower only but with a rectangular tray and sliding door) and same nice decor as previous bathroom. The room was still tiny. Had no wardrobe, just a little rail in the corner in a tiny 'alcove'. The safe was on the floor of this alcove with no fixings and had no power. It was actually just switched off (a switch inside it)..so this was rectified although I though it should have been fixed to something. The bed was against one wall, then bedside table at one side. This bedside table was our only drawers. One very small top drawer, then a deeper drawer with a huge phone book in it. Needless to say we couldn't really unpack and had to just keep a case open. I thought the wallpaper was dirty. It was nice modern wallpaper, and it was embossed but I thought it looked like there was dust in the embossed squares! The carpet wasn't very nice either. The bedding however was nice. And as I said the bathroom was nice (although tiny!). I would probably not go back to this hotel as if I had to stay in the first room I know I couldn't sleep....and this type of room would always be a possibility!", "Date": "June 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Laguna Hills, CA", "Title": "\u201cLocation and service trump all\u201d", "Author": "Roskolnikov", "ReviewID": "UR7854009", "Content": "We were the proverbial hard luck pair arriving at this hotel: coming off a red-eye at 7 AM, arriving therefore when there was nowhere to put us but a room only one foot wider than the queen bed was long.

However, when you\u2019re lucky enough to find a perfectly located hotel AND one with high standards and cleanliness, you are really lucky! And this is the case with the Washington Jefferson! When I emerged from 42nd street station (on the E line (blue) from Jamaica) I thought I should just catch a cab as this was the first time visiting this hotel and I had no idea where it was. The taxi driver hadn\u2019t heard of it either but after showing him the address, took me straight there. The ride was quick, costing just $4.50 I was too early to check in (as check in is 3:00pm and it was only 12:00pm), but the very friendly front desk staff looked after my bags. This was a perfect opportunity to do a bit of sight seeing and \u201ctop of the rock\u201d was top of my list. The Rockefeller plaza is only a 10min slow stroll away! This was a fantastic experience, but as I did so much in NYC I cannot go into great detail. I will write reviews for the sightseeing experiences I encountered (some good and some not so good) in separate reviews on Trip advisor! When I returned to the WJ I was given the key to my room. I had previously requested a room on a high floor as this should reduce noise pollution from traffic and air con. The room was nice and NOT as small as I had expected. I was very pleasantly surprised. I\u2019m guessing this room was unique as I was really expecting a shoe box after reading previous reviews. I took pictures with my mobile phone so when I figure out how to post them, I\u2019ll put them up and you can make your own mind up. Rooms The rooms are very well equipped with a docking station for your I-POD (which also works as a radio), a large wall mounted TV and in-room complimentary safe. I was on floor 6 (top floor) and although the elevator waiting time was a little on the slow side, it was definitely a floor I would recommend. Now, with regards to noise. Although I was on the top floor, there was a considerable amount of noise pollution, but not from traffic. The room overlooks a kind of square shape and at the bottom of the shaft is the air con system. Because of the square shape, the noise echoes up and is very noticeable on some nights and this is from the 6th floor so I imagine the noise must be a real nuisance if staying on a lower floor. Apart from that, my only other complaint was that the carpet in the room seemed a little on the old side and I counted 2 large stains. But really, this is a MINOR complaint. The rooms are spotless and replenished on a daily basis. The hotel is excellent and connected to a sushi bar and although raw fish is not my thing, you cannot smell any unpleasantness from the restaurant. The location is superior. Overall, this has been a bloody good find! FOOD If, like myself, sushi isn\u2019t your thing, there are some of the finest food establishments on your doorstep. The WJ is situated in an area known as Midtown or Hells Kitchen and the \u201crestaurant row\u201c. Although I never bothered with restaurant row, I will recommend Rays Pizza (around the corner from the hotel) as this was the best pizza in Manhattan and they knew it. And at $2.99 a slice (Massive slice) I was more than impressed. They also sell subs, pasties and lots of other tasty NY grub! Also, I cannot recommend the Cosmic Diner enough for breakfast. I ate here every morning and it was really cheap. It was difficult to spend more than $10! I ordered scrambled eggs, pancakes with syrup and refillable coffee and I think it came to about $7. The pancakes were huge and the coffee was probably one of the best cups I\u2019ve had in a while in NY (better than Starbucks and cheaper!!). The portions were so generous, I couldn\u2019t finish them and I can eat for England! This is on the same side as Rays Pizza but about 5 shops down. Opposite Cosmic diner but a little further down in the direction towards central park was a Bagel place. I cannot remember the name, but the bagels with cream cheese were mmmmmm! NY cuisine is personally my favourite, but not for the weight conscious\u2026 FINALLY If the size of the room is the only thing putting you off booking this hotel, you\u2019re crazy. I stayed in the executive room at the Hilton London Kensington this Easter and this room was smaller than the room at the WJ! What do you need your room for in NYC? Sleep and shower. If you plan to spend long periods of time in you hotel room, then maybe New York is not a city you should be visiting. There is SO much to see and do in this city that any time spent in your room is wasted time in my opinion! I am a frequent traveller and I\u2019m very critical, but I WILL definitely return to this hotel at some point. I would give this hotel a well earned 8/10.

I was so afraid that the room would be castrophobic (after reading all these TA reviews!) that I called in advance to make sure we got a room that at least had a tub in the john. (Some of the standard rooms have showers only and no tub). Must have called there about 5 times before I ever was able to talk to someone live and in person before we arrived. We got the room with the tub just by asking. Once we did arrive (at 9:00AM), the concierge was very helpful about taking our bags (and laptop) into a locked area until we could check in at 3:00PM. The hotel location is marginal at best. The House of Brews with 80 beers from around the world is a few doors down...and a couple higher-end restaurants are across the street. What I wanted and needed was a self-service laundromat. Was Very grateful to find one on the same street and just a half-block up towards 9th Avenue...but that place is closed as of this past Saturday (another story). Too bad because I paid only $15 to have 18 lbs. worth of laundry done at that place! I have no clue what the hotel would have charged to have our laundry sent out...but after being burned on a cruise back in 2000 with a $100 laundry bill...I didn't want to repeat that mistake in judgement ever again! If you walk up the block, you end up on 9th Avenue where a lot of various Hell's Kitchen restaurants and bars are. If you walk down the block, you end up on 8th Avenue which doesn't have much in that immediate area but a Rite Aid store (for pick up pop/juice/munchies). No room service at this hotel by the way. It is attached to a sushi-type restaurant. Didn't go there, but it appeared high end. The hotel room itself was small. As in I'm on my side of the bed and can reach to touch the wall small. My daughter was with me...she could do the same on her side of the bed. No place to hang clothes...no drawers...no nothing except two very small nighstands on either side of the bed...and the t.v. (as has been mentioned here before) up in the corner ceiling. T.V. went out after the first night. Manager said they were having problems and it'd be corrected by that evening. Thank goodness it was corrected because no t.v. to watch in a room that small would have been a nightmare! Keys to get into the room is another story. Got 3 or 4 replacement card keys while we were there; mine never did work to get into the room all week long. Bedding was o.k. I don't know why there is such a big deal made about down comforters or pillows, etc.; the mattress is on a wooden platform and all I know is that my back was killing me about every morning when I got up! The bathroom was small (what else did you expect?) and the soaps/shampoos/body lotion wasn't anything special. Not Molton Brown...not organic or fancy-schmancy...just boring and somewhat stinky to boot! Elevator went out one day; very bad since that was the day I took the laundry out in my 20 lb. huge suitcase...and down 5 flights of stairs by myself. YUCK! Good news! New York Times everyday...but you have to get it yourself by asking at the front desk where the papers are held on a back countertop. So---what grade do I give the WJ (Washington Jefferson) overall? For $125 a night....a C maybe C+. I've been going to Manhattan for the past 20+ years and have stayed everywhere from the Kimberly to the Beacon from the Sheraton Towers to the Olcott to private apartments. The WJ is just o.k.

My name is R.C. I stayed at the Washington Jefferson in MidTown Manhattan, from Tuesday, March 14, 2006 till Friday morning, March 17, 2006. Where shall I begin? Aesthetically, it was a pleasing place. The decorating in fine, the outside exterior was okay. It doesn't have a rundown look by any means. The hotel itself is an old building that was reconfigured into a hotel, obviously. Having said that, by converting an old building into a hotel, they obviously were not able to have more space in particular rooms. I stayed in the least expensive room (for NYC standards). I'm not a tall person (almost 5'9\"), but goodness gracious, the room seemed to have been built for a Munchkin (i.e. the movie, the \"Wizard of Oz\"). There is VERY little surface space to put store/place things. The bed size was okay. The combination comforter/bedsheet was soft, but kind of bulky. I would have preferred a standard hotel bedsheet. At the end of the bed, there was a tiny bit of space, where you could place your luggage, but two pieces at the most. The small closet dresser was average. There was a tiny bit of surface space on top, but not much at that. Inside the closet, you have a small iron and ironing board. (I didn't use it, because I had no way of knowing if it would sputter on my clothes or not.) The best feature of the entire room was the security safe. It is the type where you punch in four digit numbers to open and close the safe. THAT I liked. The door of the dresser/closet is quite close to the side of the bed. Can we talk about the bathroom? It has a nice decor. If you were thinking of taking a bath, fuggedaboutit. There is a stand up shower, with surrounding glass, all around. The water pressure was fine and the water nice and hot, as you prefer. The vanity/sink? Oh my!. Once again, a Munchkin would have LOVED that one. It has a tiny sink, with the spigot protruding about three quarters of the way into the middle of the sink. If you want to splash your face or what not, then you have to be careful about splashing water on the floor. They do include some tiny little containers of soap, conditioner and body wash and a few little grooming kits. (Of course I took them home with me.) The lobby: Very nice, with cushioned seats and sofas here and there. Glass entry doors. There are usually two gentlemen who are there to help. The normal check in time is 3:00 p.m. (which is usually not mentioned in the online sites). I got there around 12:30 p.m. and managed to check in around an hour later. The hotel itself is divided into two sections, with each section having its elevator. I had a room on the second floor, so I could either walk up to my room or use the elevator. Aside from the room safe, the best thing about this place was the location. Since I had a ticket for \"Wicked\", the Gershwin Theatre was only a block and a half away. There are plenty of places to shop and eat. Around the corner, there is a Rite Aid (pharmacy / store). I loved eating at this place called the Cosmic Diner, located at 888 8th Avenue, at the corner of 52nd Street. The prices are reasonable, plus they're open 24 hours a day. There is a subway/Metro station located on 50th Street, close to the hotel. I only used the subway during my brief stay, no buses or taxi cabs. I paid $7.00 for single day card (good till 3:00 a.m. the next day). It was quite useful. In conclusion, if I ever go back to NYC, it will not be at the Washington Jefferson. Although I'm not claustrophobic, I feel a bit constrained inside my room. Nearby, there is a Hampton Inn on 8th Avenue. I may check them out next time. I think I'd rather pay a little more $$$ to guarantee a room with a more comfortable size. The W J is okay, but I'd rather have more space. Speaking of safety, the hotel is located in a safe area. There was a bit of garbage bags waiting to be picked up. Also, if you're out and about into the wee hourrs of the morning, then expect to show your room card to the hotel personnel at the door. It makes sense.

The room was about 100 degrees and you can't adjust the temp. If you open the window you will hear the neighbors all night long (I was lucky to have someone next door coughing until 1 a.m). The room itself was dirty - stained carpets, lampshades. The remote control didn't turn the TV on so you had to climb on top of the bed to do that or to adjust the volume. The bed was uncomfortable - super hard. I asked to move my room twice and was told i could pay $50 more for a different room. I booked through orbitz so I had pre-paid (a LOT comparatively) and I didn't have much leverage.

But, upon arrival I was delighted. Located at the edge of Hell's Kitchen (P.C. renamed \"Clinton\"), this hotel was clean and in a great location. We had EASY walks to Rockefeller Center, Times Square, and a longer, but enjoyable walk to Central Park and on to the Met. Restaurant Row (W. 46th Street) was a boon! Excellent Italian and Thai food just around the corner. Check our pre-theater price fixe menus. Coffee and bagel shops all along 8th Ave. That's the location. The public spaces of the hotel were clean and nicely furnished. Free NY Times. There IS a restaurant in the hotel now--a sushi place. There is only one elevator, but the marble steps are easily managed. We stayed on the 6th floor. The room was exactly as found in the photos--nothing more! The rooms are small, but there is space to walk around, put your bags, and not be cramped. Bed was comfortable. Not noisy (we were on the back side of the hotel), but the usual noises--street noise, some doors. The bathroom was spotless and the toiletries were very nice. Remember, this is an OLD building. Spaces are smaller than your average American hotel, but that doesn't mean it isn't nice. If you've ever been on a boat, you will appreciate the efficiency of this room! I also noticed bathrooms in the hall that I think may be there for rooms without baths or for handicap access. I would stay here again. I wouldn't pick this hotel if I were staying for a week, just for a weekend or so. The smallness might start to wear on you. Our price was much less than other hotels nearby and I can't think of anything we lacked because of it.

Yes, the room was small but we could fit 2 suitcases in without falling over them and we did do alot of shopping so that meant that we had a lot of bags, but still we had room to store them. The beds were comfy and I slept everynight really well, with the window open a little. The bathroom was nice and clean, and I found the inhouse movie service great, perfect for when your resting your feet! I would recommend this hotel to others. People have to remember, this is New York, a city that never sleeps! As long as your hotel is clean and comfy, which I found this one to be, then you shouldn't have to worry about the rest. There are plenty of restaurants close to the hotel so it's not like your going to starve because there's no restaurant in the hotel, you can also order room service. I would go back to this hotel in the future, it's clean and comfortable and it has a great location.", "Date": "December 20, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cThe WJ was FANTASTIC!
