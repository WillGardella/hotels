{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good value for money, fantastic location! I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights while I atteneded a congress in Frankfurt. The location was great, as it was less than 5 mins by foot from the contral train station. I walked to the exhibition center everyday, as it was just 15 mins away. It was one stop away from the main shopping street (i think it was called Zeil). I loved the breakfast, although they didn't serve a massive variety, all foods were very tasty - the sausages, bread, eggs and homemade yoghurt, which I loved most. The staff were always friendly and helpful. The room was very basic but spotless, super clean and warm (I went there in winter). I enjoyed Frankfurt very much partly becoz I had great sleep every night.

Here is my opinion....In favour:-Fabulous Location, come out of the central station, its right opposite you, cross the road and the tram line and your in the lobby !-walking distance for shopping, restaurants and sightseeing. Superb location no doubt !-rooms were very comfortable. I got one on the 6th floor. Quite spacious and comfortable.-polite reception staff -rooms have tv, minbar, safe and I had a balcony overlooking the central station too.-very good breakfast-tea/coffee free during the day until evning at the reception.-free use of the internet to check your mails for 20 minutes each day.-brochures, sightseeing details, maps available at the reception and the staff knowledgeable.-great food available at the food stalls in the station, very reasonably priced and just 30 seconds from the hotel. So no problem what so ever for food.Not in favour:Not much against this hotel, but I should mention a few that I personally felt irritated me...1.The shower cubicle in my room was very small, and had one sliding door missing which meant I had to be careful how I used the handshower orelse Id have water all over the floor.2.Being on the top most floor, the balcony was lined with red lights. This was very very irritating because when you decide to go to bed, the whole room is filled with a red glow. Well, we were very tired, so it didnt matter much.3.Pillow was very very soft.4.Repair works taking place of the 5th floor which was very noisy. But I guess it must be over by now.Other than these, which aint major, I think the Continental is a great place to stay in. I dont know if the sizes of the rooms vary, but check your room out first before you unpack.", "Date": "Nov 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR395881786", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "vinn_2k"}, {"Content": "Good Deal!
