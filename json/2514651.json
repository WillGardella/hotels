We flew the redeye and as Marriott members with significant status asked repeatedly if we could check in early - as early as 8 am after our flight landed. We were never given warm or receptive answers over the phone, at all. People weren't persay rude, but certainly weren't going out of their way. Fortunately we had a friend's couch to crash on for the morning. My wife was able to leave bags and check in at 1 pm. So yes, I guess 1 pm is considered an early check in....... They even told her that she could have actually checked in hours earlier. It would have been nice if they could ahve called to tell her since we asked repeatedly for an early check-in.

While I normally don\u2019t mind street noise as I feel it\u2019s part of the overall ambience and experience of a new place we were woken up on night two to the sounds of what sounded like a very serious argument on the street between two gangs.

From the moment we arrived there we felt as though we were putting them out, and their go-to phrase the entire weekend seemed to be, 'there's nothing we can do'. My fianc\u00e9 and I and a friend of ours stayed recently for the New Year's Eve weekend. We had booked far in advance through hotels.com (which we discovered later did not help us receive help when we arrived) for a room with two beds. We were immediately downgraded when we got there because families took precedence. They put three of us in a room with one king-sized bed and did not bring up the roll-away cot we were promised until FIVE phone calls and 24-hours later. Two men above six feet tall had to share a bed with another woman, also not exactly short. We found out after the fact that breakfast was not included as it usually is, nor was internet. When we asked if they could provide the internet in lieu of the inconvenience with room change, there was 'nothing they could do.' We purchased internet there for 24 hours at a rate of $17--and only received 7 hours use. Again, when we approached the front desk and explained, there was 'nothing they could do', but we were more than welcome to use the WiFi in their lobby for a fee of $7 per half hour, or something ridiculous. The following day, on New Year's Eve, we found discovered a glass of orange juice, to be brought to our room, was no less than $11.74. It cost $4 for someone to push a button and come up an elevator with the glass, and they expected a tip! The following morning, after they finally brought us a roll-away (too late) we were given our bill. They had charged us twice for internet use we were barely afforded, and a $3.50 occupancy fee, which was downright embarrassing. We phoned well ahead for the valet to bring us our car, clearing stating 11 30. When we were promptly at the front desk for the allotted time, to our surprise we were informed the car had actually been brought up for 11am and had been taken back. We complained to the front desk, at which time they blamed any inconveniences on the fact we had booked with hotels.com (essentially, they didn't get the cut they usually do at a high-traffic time of year and couldn't guarantee anything) though they still took $50 off our $120 parking fee because my fianc\u00e9 was polite with his complaints. Overall, the experience with Marriott east side in no way ruined our trip, but was a complete let down. The best service I had there the entire time was from a bar-tender who didn't even work for the hotel.

Close to train stations. Walking distance to Times Square and other attractions.

Get a room overlooking the street on the lower floors and there are chances that you may hear traffic, if you are a light sleeper. -This is a historic hotel for history buffs. Georgia O'Keefe, the famous American painter, lived here with her husband, Alfred Stieglitz, when the hotel was called The Shelton and created many of her well-known works here. The Minor Idiosynchracys -There are two sets of elevators. One for ground floor to 16th and the other from 17th upward. No problem, except if you want to use the health club, it is on the 35th. To get there, you take an elevator to 32nd floor and then another elevator to 35th floor. -The rooms tend to be smaller (I think) than the Marriott Marquis, which is in Times Square.

There was no firm date for release so I had to book hotel rooms at the last moment. After staying at four hotels, I finally checked in to the Marriott East Side. I had a series of one night reservations so that I could cancel and leave with only a day notice (reservations required cancellation the day before arrival.) Some of the nights used Marriott Reward Points and some were paid. The stay extended into the weekend of the New York Marathon so hotels were full or very expensive. When I arrived at the Marriott East Side, all went well. Check-in was easy and I mentioned that I had a series of one night reservations. No problem or so I was told. My room was exactly what I had requested. Since this would be my home for the next several nights, I unpacked and was relieved that I\u2019d not need to pack/move/unpack again. I had done that four days in a row and it gets old. As an elite member of Marriott Rewards, I enjoyed a visit to the Concierge Lounge before departing for the hospital to visit my friend. The next day, I returned in the afternoon from a hospital visit and found that my key no longer would open the door. I went to reception to get new keys and was informed I\u2019d have to change rooms. At check-in they had forgotten to block me into the same room for all of my reservations. They had already blocked my room for another arriving guest so I had no choice but to move. I don\u2019t know what they would have done if I had not returned until later that evening \u2013 my stuff was in the room. So, for a fifth day I packed and moved to a new room. Now the problem began. I could not get WiFi reception in the new room. I called and was connected to their technical support service who seemed to know about the problem. They said it was most likely the router on the floor and they\u2019d have that reset. However, the next morning I still could not establish a connection to the Internet. In the hallway, I had no problem establishing connection but my room was a dead spot. On my way to the lounge, I saw another guest sitting in the hallway with his laptop so I\u2019m guessing the problem occurs with more than one room. That\u2019s inexcusable for a business hotel. I thought I would simply use the computers in the lounge or at least connect to WiFi while in the lounge. I then learned that the lounge would not be open after breakfast hours on Friday until Sunday evening. In other Marriott properties, you can at least access the lounge even if there are no other services available in the lounge. Not at this property! When the lounge is closed, no one can access the lounge. I asked about breakfast on weekends for elite guests and was told there was no option. That was a surprise and I learned a \u201cloophole\u201d in the Marriott Rewards program. If a hotel does not have a lounge, certain levels of elite members are given breakfast in the dining room. If the hotel has a lounge, you\u2019re given access to the lounge instead. If they have a lounge but it is closed, you\u2019re simply on your own for breakfast. After complaining, I was comped breakfast for the two days the lounge would be closed. I was very surprised to learn the lounge would be closed on the weekend. The hotel was sold out and they were charging premium prices due to the marathon. Seems to me this would have been a good weekend to keep the lounge open. Even though this is an older property, they do have the new Marriott beds and they were comfortable. Housekeeping did a decent job of cleaning the rooms. Water pressure and temperature in the shower did vary a bit during a shower but not enough to make me get out of the shower. There was very little counter space in the bathroom. Wake-up calls arrived on schedule. Overall, the hotel and rooms feel older, dated, and occasionally shabby. Internet service was spotty as mentioned above. Even when I tried using the wired computers in the lounge (when it was open), the response time was terribly slow. There frequently was a line at reception but my waits were not overly long. Maybe I was being overly critical because I was preoccupied with my friend\u2019s hospitalization. My stay in New York had become unexpectedly extended and I really needed the Internet to keep up with issues at work. This was a time when I needed Marriott to come through and provide the services I\u2019ve come to expect. Usually that happens, but it didn\u2019t happen at the Marriott East Side. On Sunday (the day of the marathon), I was happy to check out and move next door to the new Hyatt Lex58 . But that\u2019s another review\u2026. Overall, I was disappointed in the property, their handling of my reservations, and the awful state of Internet service in the hotel. I\u2019d certainly encourage others to look elsewhere at this price point and in this neighborhood. There certainly are plenty of other options within several blocks.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lexington SC", "Title": "\u201cGreat Visit and really nice people!\u201d", "Author": "cleanfreak56", "ReviewID": "UR121437873", "Content": "Just returned from a four night stay at this Marriott.

The windows did not open very much so you could not get much fresh air into the room. The bellmen were very helpful with the luggage & taxis - all with a smile. The lobby has been updated and very trendy and inviting as you enter the hotel. The bar area is new and has a nice upscale feel to it. As platinum members we had access to the concierge lounge which was one of the better lounges that we have visited. They have morning breakfast of eggs and some starch, cereal, fruits, and beverages. There is no sausage or bacon - just cold cuts on the other side if you want something to go with the eggs. During our stay we were fortunate to have the pleasure of meeting Kendra, one of the concierges in the lounge. Once she found out it was our anniversary she surprised us with a wonderful bottle of champagne and dessert. She really made our stay a pleasant one and we felt like we gained a very nice new friend at the hotel. The location of the hotel is within walking distance to Grand Central Station, bus stops, Times Square, Rockerfeller Center and 5th Avenue shops.On a previous visit we stayed at the Marriott Marquis in Time Square.

A hotel from its inception, it was cared for by one family until it was converted to a Marriott. The rooms are \"old\" style with high ceilings and small dimensions, but what this property lacks in size, it has in character. Understand this is not the Marquis or Downtown Financial District Marriott, but it has charm and the lobby is beautiful. The rooms are adequete for couples or for a solo trip, would not recomend with a family. The bar is something you need to enjoy while on property and the location is top notch. Right in mid-town, the name East Side does not do it justice. Would have stayed all four nights, but the rate doubled half way through our visit. I was able to get a rate for less than 200 a night and this property for that price is worth it, better than most for that rate in NY.

The check-in was fine and quick, and in fact the bell-hop was extra kind, holding an umbrella over my head and telling me, \"let me just make sure you're safe and dry and I will bring your suitcase in just a moment,\" which was a really pleasant way to be greeted. Reception lady was charming, and I got my preferred room, huge and very nice and clean. They've done some \"soft\" refurbishments, although the old furniture is still pretty much there. Access to the lounge was just fine, and I even had breakfast there. My only small ding, they give you hot scrambled eggs, but no bacon or sausage. Would it really be too much to ask for some breakfast meat? I mean, my corporate rate was over $400 a night so this is not a cheap hotel... Hmmm... Other small ding, the lobby concierge was gone by 8:30pm, which I think is a little harsh. I needed some help, and had to get it elsewhere. I'd expect longer hours from this property. Finally, lobby rennovations are going forward full-steam ahead. The lobby bar is now cut off from the lobby, and the lobby desk has been traumatized. I'm not really sure why a rennovation is necessary - it was absolutely fine and charming \"old school\" previously, and I really think they should have kept it the same way. This is probably due to some new young whippersnapper at corporate saying, \"let's see, we need to be more cutting-edge, let's re-do everything!\" Well, guess what, when you have something that works well, why tinker with it?

Lots of yelling across the room as cabs are arranged, etc. Location- Excellent. Located close to many attractions, places to dine, shopping, and a safe part of the city. Rooms- I have good and bad things to say about the room. I will start with the good: it was clean, and we had a room in the corner, which was larger than most. Beds were extremely comfortable and I slept like a baby all night, despite the street noise, which I will get to in a minute.We had a long hall way to the bathroom, which added space and privacy, with marble countertops and an updated feel, plus an area for our closet that was generous. One other thing that always scores high points for me is the mini fridge, apparently in all rooms. Wireless worked great and is free for rewards members. Otherwise it was $17. Ok, the bad. The air conditioner was an old wall unit and it sucked. It worked good as far as producing cold air, but it was VERY annoying because it whined and rattled really loudly. So we had to shut it off at night to sleep, of course making the room stuffy. We called maintainence and he came while we were gone, but I saw little to no improvenent. Also I could hear the people next to us through the walls. Especially in the bathroom. The street noise can be loud...we faced Lexington and we were on the 18th floor. At times it was quite loud. So ask for an interior or high floor room and I'll bet you will be ok. Other than that...we had no issues.

Every other hotel was a minimum of $100-$150 more per night!! Check-in was quick and easy, and although we arrived at noon and planned to leave our bags at the desk while we began touring, our room was already ready and we were able to go up and settle in early. I didn't have to request this, either, and in my past experience most places will just not permit check-ins early, certainly not 3-4 hours early! The rooms were comfortable and though ours (with a king bed and a rollaway) was on the small side, the other room with two doubles was much roomier. The beds were very comfortable and I'm picky about beds. Everything was clean. Housekeeping was also very helpful and prompt for forgotten items or extra pillows. The location is perfect for visiting Rockefeller Center (easy walking distance) or Times Square (also walking distance but a bit further, probably 15 minutes or so -- unless it pours while you're there like it did for us and forces you into a cab instead!). Not staying in Times Square ended up being a HUGE blessing -- I haven't been there in many years but don't remember the absolute CRUSH of people we encountered there. It was so bad that you literally couldn't move on the sidewalks at certain points, and you just had to put your shoulder down and force your way through the loitering crowd. The sidewalks for 10-15 people deep in many spots. We did visit on the first weekend of April school vacation, which I'm hoping accounted for some of the crowds, but I don't know.

On arrival we didn't have to queue to check in and although our allocated room was nice and clean, it was very dark as we were directly facing a brick wall. I rang reception to ask if it was possible to move to a different room as it was a special holiday for us and we really wanted a room with a view. This was no problem and we were allocated a corner room on the 8th floor, it was so much bigger and brighter than the first room, so if you don't like your room for whatever reason it may be worth asking to move. The location of the hotel is good, about 15 minutes walk to Times Square. However, we did find the resturants were more expensive as we were staying in more of a business area than a tourist area but this was fine as I felt the service at the hotel was better because of this and we soon found some good places to eat within a short walking distance. There was also a shop nearby called Duane & Reade which sells snacks, drinks etc and there is also a Starbucks within just a couple of minutes walk. I wouldn't recommend buying anything from the hotel shop as this was very expensive. We found an Irish bar called O'Neills (about a ten minute walk from the hotel) which was really nice, the staff made us feel very welcome. One night they had live Irish music so if you like this kind of thing then it's well worth a visit. We also ate there one day for lunch and the portions were so big I didn't need anything to eat for the rest of the day! Good prices too. We ate in Ruth Chris' Steak House one night which is just off Times Square - highly recommended. You also decide on the tip you want to leave as this isn't added onto the bill like many places do. The staff at the hotel were more than happy to book this for us and arranged a cab for us too. We did all the usual tourist things and found it very easy and safe to travel around on the Subway but as the weather was so nice while we were there, it was nice to walk as often as possible as the hotel was in such a good location to Grand Central Station, Public Library, Central Park, Fifth Ave etc. When we left the hotel arranged a taxi for us to take us to JFK Airport, this was a huge private 4X4 type vehicle and was much more comfortable and cleaner then the yellow cabs. The price quoted was $55 including tolls and tip which was really good value and we would definately use this service again. We were also able to use the internet service free of charge in the Business Centre to check-in for our flights.

We've stayed at the other two Marriott hotels (Marquis, Renaissance) but decided to go for the East Side Marriott this time. It proved to be a right choice.

We parked there and just walked around the corner into the hotel lobby. -Liberty Deli Cafe on 49th St. (2 blocks west from hotel) offers good varieties of food/drinks with good prices. The meals are sold by portions not by weight. For our family of 2 adults 2 kids it cost $18 for dinner, including drinks. -Shin Wong Chinese restaurant on 48th about 4 blocks to the West has the most authentic Chinese food around Times Square. We had 3 dishes for dinner for $23. Their soup noodle with wonton is very very good. We had 3 meals there and saw local people eat there too. -Variety Deli and Cafe almost next to Shing Wong is not so good. Food is not so fresh. They sell food by weight so a box of lunch can be more expensive than you thought. We walked to all the theatres of the shows we saw on this trip. ---the good: Phantom of the Opera (good as always), The 39 Steps (very good comedy), South Pacific (good musical) ---the bad: THe Gazillion Bubble Show (totally not worth the money in my opinion, even my 5 yr old was not thrilled, and we were sitting in 2nd row) Overall, we like the Marriott NY East and would love to stay here again.", "Date": "April 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "nj", "Title": "\u201cWill never book here again, they make you wait 2+ hours after check in time\u201d", "Author": "mktrip1", "ReviewID": "UR60601262", "Content": "And the rooms are tiny too.

He was so pleasant and helpful. We had room service one night as we could not walk any more after our day shopping. The food and service was great and only cost $70 for dinner for two with beer and tea included. Never again will I stay in hotels close to Times Square, I'll be staying in the Marriott. The concierge was great and organised a 'town car' for us to go the airport in and it only cost $75 including tolls and tips - again this is the cheapest fare we have ever paid to the airport from a hotel in NYC. This is my seventh trip to NYC and would have to say the best trip ever by far and this was all down to the fantastic hotel that I stayed in.

I've stayed at several Marriotts before in the UK and Europe and have found them to be to a good, high 4 star standard. We booked a twin room (2 double beds). On arrival (late at night after a very long flight..) we were told sorry, we only have a room with one king bed for you. The hotel had overbooked on its twins and as a late arrival we were the unlucky ones. The receptionist agreed to put an extra bed in the room (you'd think they might have had they initiative to do this before our arrival given that a twin room had been booked!!). After much prompting he eventually said he'd try and move us to a twin the following day. Fine said we. The whole process seemed like trying to pull teeth, he clearly seemed to have no interest in us at all. After being given no info about the hotel amenities, we asked when breakfast was and were told until midday. Shame we came down the following morning to discover it was finished at 11. No-one we spoke to seemed in the least apologetic that the room type we booked wasn't available. Maybe this seems a small thing, but part of the reason we chose the hotel was to have a reasonable size room with 2 double beds, which few hotels offer. The room itself was very small - and i mean small. I am used to London hotel rooms which can be truly box like - in America you expect something larger! We had a panoramic view of a building site (drilling commenced at 7am) and a large brick wall. The website said the hotel had been recently refurbished but the only signs i could see of this in the bedrooms were the flat screen tvs. The carpet was tatty and there wasn't even a mini bar. The room felt stale and there was a rather unpleasant musty smell through the hotel, even in the towels. The bed I must admit was very comfortable (the king bed not the camp bed!). Next day we were told there would be no twin rooms available for the duration of our stay. After much probing for some kind of acknowledgment of the inconvenience caused to us, the staff eventually said they would move us to a larger room (still with king bed and camp bed style arrangement) and offered us a comp breakfast. That room must have been about 2 sq foot larger than the first. The view of building site remained, albeit a less noisy side of the site! On checkout, the receptionist charged the bill straight to my card without even showing a print out first - (this is just common politeness?!) I then had to ask them to refund the complimentary breakfast - which they had charged us for !! - back on to my card. The biggest issue for us was the lack of service offered. I understand that hotels get full and don't always have the right rooms, but not once did anyone apologise for this or offer anything as a solution - i had to push all the way for a room move. I work in the hotel industry and know what is possible with a tiny bit of effort and a smile. When travelling to America, with it's famous friendly service we expected better. Maybe this hotel does too well purely just from its location and feels that service is not necessary. I was really disappointed - I would have expected much better from a brand like Marriott.

The NYC pocket maps at the hotel were a godsend. The room was for 3 people and there was more than enough room for all of us. It was very clean and obviously refurbished recently as it wasn't as dated as some of the other hotels we'd checked out in Manhattan. There was a huge king-sized bed (which I guess is Superking in the UK) and even the fold-out bed was comfortable. The bathroom was a decent size - it wasn't huge but had a bath and shower (which was great). We also had an ice machine right outside our room which came in useful! Checking in and out was painless and when it came to arranging a late check-out, there were no issues whatsoever.

The real view was from the health club on the 32nd floor- I could see the backs of the building's gargoyles and the East River. The health club was well-equipped and uncrowded at 6:30 AM on a Monday- everything had a TV screen and earphones you could use if you didn't have your own. My only complaint was the radio they also played in the health club. Why do you need that when you have your own TV and it competes with the pounding of feet on the treadmill? They charged $15.95/day (plus tax) for their \"wired for business\" package, which is what you need to get on the Internet. This is extortion. A huge % of their target customers wants Internet access. Why not build it into the rate?

I was a tag along like the other spouses and children who just came in to enjoy the city. The hotel did a wonderful job hosting the meetings and providing private breakfasts, lunches and a Sunday brunch for our group. The hotel's location is very convenient for sightseeing, yet removed from the bustle/bedlam of Times Square. Unlike the Hilton which is a few blocks away, this Marriott has the feel of a boutique hotel. The valet service was quick to park our car and check-in was super fast. We had a nice refurbished room with 2 super comfortable double beds and a nice marbled bathroom. Our towels were fine so they must have upgraded. On the top corners of the headboards they've mounted small reading lights so you can read in bed without disturbing the other person which can often be a problem in traveling. I also found the room very comfortable temperature wise. So often hotel rooms can be very stuffy and you spend the night playing with the thermostat because it's either too hot or too cold. Even though the hotel has down comforters, there is a nice chenille throw on the bed that you can use as a light blanket if the comforter's too warm. Women of a certain age will get what I'm talking about. Our group was booked for a dinner cruise on the Bateaux which was something we normally wouldn't have done but it was really nice to see the lights of the city from on board a boat on the Hudson. We got really close to the Statue of Liberty and it's a beautiful sight lit up at night. You don't have to take the Bateaux as there are other tour boats that do night cruises and I highly recommend a relaxing cruise on the Hudson when the sun goes down. If you avoid the subway like I do, let me just give you a bit of advice about the cabs that I found out about on previous visits to the city. The cabbies change shifts at either 4 or 5pm depending upon what time they started in the morning. After 4pm it gets increasingly difficult to hail a cab unless you catch one dropping someone off at a hotel, etc. By 5pm on a business day, it's near impossible. If it's raining, forget it. So unless you plan to walk or take a bus or subway, keep that in mind and head back to the hotel before then. Also allow time to get a cab in the evening if you have dinner reservations too. This Friday evening some people were waiting about 10-15minutes for a cab around 8pm at the hotel. If you want to try to get reservations to popular restaurants, I suggest you make reservations days ahead of your arrival or else try for an early time. We've always had luck with that.", "Date": "April 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manhattan Beach", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay at the Marriott East Side!\u201d", "Author": "beach567", "ReviewID": "UR14722719", "Content": "I stayed at the Marriott EastSide for a girls shopping weekend Mar 27-30.

I must say that we will by any means necessary avoid Marriot hotels in the future. We had been recommended your hotel by a friend who actually works for Marriot in HK. Right from our arrival, unhappiness was caused: - We had an early flight in from Vegas, so we requested for an early check. No rooms were available, and a lady staff told us that. I persisted to ask if \"it was at all possible\" and \"what if we upgraded to another better room\", and \"nothing at all, are u sure?\" - BOTH ladies at your front desk reacted defensively, with one even telling the other that \"I was already telling them that no rooms were available\", and \"No, sir, it is just not possible, if we had we would give you the room\". Their tone left much to be desired. Next, after checking in, I dialed \"At Your Service\" for slippers and toothpaste. The At Your Service button wasn't working - so I tried the operator (and note: nothing indicated that the button zero was operator) and had her redirect me. The guy At Your Service was disbelieving when I told him the button wasn't working and he protested \"But you are now speaking to At Your Service\". I had to take pains to explain to him what happened. could i possibly have anything to gain from making up such a story ? Next, it took FORTY minutes for the staff to come to our room and ONLY with toothpaste. By then my wife and I were already trying to sleep due to jetlag. The slippers - which I had emphasized more heavily - were forgotten/missed. It took another 10 min for him to come with the slippers.

It was very clean, nicely decorated (especially the bathroom), and it was nice having a flat-screen HD television in the room. As members of the Marriott Rewards club, we got an added perk of access to the Concierge Lounge with free water, sodas, snacks, breakfast, etc. We took advantage of that every day.

Our room on the 15th floor was relatively spacious with a king bed with great beddin, a 37 in HDTV and a small but adequate bathroom. Now mind youit was January in New York, yet we had to keep the air conditioner runing to maintain a decent temperature. When we got to the room the thermostat was set to 68degrees yet the HVAC unit kept blwing in cold air. We changed the setting to 72 and after a 1/2 hour or so it started blowing cold air again. We turned the unit off and by 2:00AM the romm temp had climbed to 78. By then we were happy to turn the AC unit back on. In the morning my wife used the hair dryer which was hidden on the top of the closet. It kept turning off and then shot aparks out. A wet head in NYC in January isn't fun.

There were a numberr of people who came in around midnight to learn that they could not sit in the bar or have a drink. We did have breakfast in the restaurant. We did the buffet for $21.00.

This hotel is across the street from the Waldorf. (this hotel is also a short walk (four or five blocks) from Rockerfeller Center and Time Square/Broadway, fyi). At check-in we were greated very warmly by the front desk staff. We mentioned that this was our first time to NYC and she provided us with a welcome bag comprised of a book on 1001 things to see in NYC and some other welcome gifts...free. We were also granted our request for a high floor (NYC street noise is bad...unless you are used to it) and we were even provided a corner room, no extra charge. Again, I used reward points, but we were not given a broom closet, we actually received a great room on the 30th floor. This is a very nice hotel and I strongly recommend it for anyone visting who needs a good base from which to explore the city. There is a subway stop two blocks away, and it is a breeze to use and very safe. This is a 4 star hotel with more than adequate services. Since we were sightseeing all day, we were not in the room very much. However, the hotel has an excellent fitness room on the 35th floor (no fee) complete with all you need for a workout (unless you have walked all over Manhattan, of course). There is one restaurant, which is standard Marriott fare...nothing to write home about. This is New York and one should dine out off-property anyway. We found this Marriott to be clean, with a nice lobby, helpful and attentive staff, and updated and modern rooms (37\" LG flat screen TV). One word of caution, there appeared to be a time-share rep for a property in Florida based in the lobby, but they didn't bother us too much. For a ride back to the airport, the hotel has an arrangement with a limo service that will take you back for $40 cash payable to the driver. We expected a sedan, but I guess it was unavailable because we received a white strech limo...for the $40 rate. Nice way to end our trip. I recommend this hotel, and would stay here again. NYC is expensive, and if you get a good rate this is a great choice. If you want to spend $1000/nt and up, there are plenty of properties to take your money.

MTA bus M101 downtown, stops a block away from the hotel. Also taxi cabs are parked outside the hotel's main entrance. Rooms: My family & I stayed here last year before the renovation began, and thankfully went back again last month after the re-do. The changes: Carpet - brown (dull, old, boring) TO red - (w/ swirl prints, modern and vibrant looking) Hallway - used to be dark w/ less corner lamps- NOW, much better lighting fixtures plus more wall frame decors. The big mirror fronting the guest elevators w/ black chest adds to more sophisticated feel of the hotel. We had a room on the 27th floor. King sized bed, w/ a sofa bed. 3 windows, 3 side tables, a ref., flatscreen tv, a/c, coffee maker (3 decaf, 3 regular, 4 condiment packs, 1 set of tea) BED: 3 shams, 3 feather pillows, blanket, duvet (white sheets) plus a red bed scarf. It made the room look much brighter. The wall paper was beige which is way better than the brown one the hotel had. The bathroom was almost the same. (marble tiled floors) except for the addition of the bigger mirror and new shower curtain. B/R Amenities: Bath & Body works products. (small sizes) 4 towels, 4 handtowels, 4 washcloths, 1 bathmat. hairdryer, 2 laundry bags, iron, iron board (inside the closet). FITNESS CENTER: its located on the 35th floor. Go to the 32nd flr. to connect to another elevator at the back to get to the FC. They have new exercise machines. Earphones are provided. Most machines are equipped w/ tv screens. There's also 2 flatscreen tv sets in the FC. A rack of handtowels. Water dispenser. Bathroom. CONCIERGE LOUNGE: access depending on the room level and membership. Its open from 7am-10am..for breakfast...1pm drinks... 5-9pm for light snacks.... its closed on the weekends though. SERVICE: our housekeeper was kind & anticipated our needs. We had extra towels in our room & bathroom amenities. ****Needs imrpovement: The front desk staff. Unprofessional and loud in dealing w/ guests. (basing from our obeservation on how they handled the other guests' reservation queries.) ****FOOD: Best tip, eat out. The Room Service menu didn't impress us. We had a good breakfast at Cafe' Metro 2 blocks uptown by the 6 train station for half the price. *****being a Platinum member, i expected that the renovation would also mean providing a fully stocked mini bar. But there was nothing. Also, amenities like a Robe or slippers would have been nice... even a bath gel or mouthwash should be standard in ALL rooms. After paying $400++ / night, those \"little extras\" would be appreciated. ******TIP: request for a turndown service. they offer sleep oils and chocolates. ******use the door sign for housekeeping cleaning. To avoid being disturbed by the loud knocks at 8am on a Saturday morning. *******choose rooms such as 6,7,8, on the high floor. We were told that those rooms are quite spacious plus they have sofa beds... btw, those are rooms w/ king beds. *******This is a NON-smoking hotel. I was informed that when housekeepers find cigarette's in the rooms (or proof thereof) that the guest/s are smoking in the room, they will call the supervisor, to inspect the further, then bill the guest $250. So think twice if you feel like smoking in your room! For convenience, we'll defintely come back. For business travelers? Yes i would reccommend this hotel. but for families? we were able to see a few rooms that are rather small to accommodate a cot... but if you don't mind the overcrowding, then this hotel might be right for you. ;-)", "Date": "August 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cLocation is great, room updated, but watch out for noise on lower floors\u201d", "Author": "anm123", "ReviewID": "UR8208193", "Content": "We have stayed at the Marriott East Side several times over the years as the location is perfect for us. At first I was impressed with the room makeover, but after the intial impact I realized there are a few things that aren't right. First off the closet is very small. It is New York, but it is the smallest closet I've ever seen, it looks like a broom closet. To add to it, they have placed the safe on the floor, so there is no room to leave your shoes in the closet, let alone your luggage. They have several items they also store in the closet so it really limits you in what you can store in there. Yes there are 3 large size dresser drawers, but I prefer my clothes to hang and my shoes to be kept in the closet. The bed is very comfortable, but they have overdone it a bit with the number of pillows - no place to put them when you go to bed at night so we kept throwing them on the floor. The big problem for us was the noise. We were on the 6th floor, Lexington Ave side and the street noise at night was awful. My husband and I lived in New York for years, so we're use to city living, but I couldn't get over how loud it was. We did not sleep well that night at all. Upon check-out the front desk agent said that since it is a historic building they cannot sound-proof the windows.

I fully expected that our room would not be ready - I was correct. I also learned that my request for two double beds was not confirmed (only requested) when I made the reservation. They said that they could give me a king room with two roll-away beds. I pre-registered for the room (this meant that they would take my CC info and put me into the system. All I needed to do now was pick up the keys.) They also said that the room would be ready at 12:00 noon. We checked our luggage and went to explore the city. We returned to the hotel at 1:00. The room still wasn't ready and wouldn't be ready until 3:00. So basically, requesting early check-in meant nothing. Both times, as I waited in line at the front desk, I overheard quite a few conversations of guests that were in the same situation with the beds as we were. This hotel needs more double beds! OK - finally about 3:20 our room was ready! Once we arrived at the room, we discovered four large containers of some very disgusting Chinese food that was obviously overlooked by the housekeeping staff in the cabinet next to the refirgerator. Now this food wasn't just missed that morning. This food had been there for a few days as it was growing mild and was very obviously spolied - YUCK!!! As promised, our roll-away beds arrived but without blankets and pillows. One roll-away was broken. We dealt with it the first night and used pillows and a throw off the king bed and a blanket that was found in the closet. The hotels location is within walking distance to Rockafeller Center, St. Patrick's and even Central Park. There's a subway station nearby for anything else not close to the hotel.

We only paid 199 dollar for our room which at the time of booking was a NY promo for Marriott Rewards members.

The rooms obviously need an upgrade as we saw some falling debris from the ceiling. The fridge in the room was empty and was noisy during the night so I had to switch it off..

When we arrive we are always greeting with smiles and hello's. The hotel guest relations coordinator Kenda remembers us everytime we go (about 3 times a year). This particular stay we reserved a Jr Suite with a pull out sofa for our children. When we got to the 6th floor room it smelled of smoke (non-smoking hotel) and the tub was clogged. I called down to the at your service desk and requested a change of rooms due to the fact of an asthmatic child. We were not given the same room but instead the Ambabassador Suite on the 33rd floor. The hotel staff could not have been more helpful. My profile with Marriott states that I have an asthmatic child, however I don't feel that this is why I was switched to such a large suite. I believe it is the relations that the staff tries to keep with it's guest. I have never experienced a rude employee at this hotel. Having stayed here about 3 times a year for the past 5 I find that quite amazing. Not sure if everyone knows this, but JW Marriott is the parent company for the Ritz Carlton. As a frequent guest of the Ritz in Boston as well as the Ritz Beach Resort in Naples FL. It is easy to compare this category 7 Marriott to the Ritz. For anyone who expects a LARGE hotel room in NYC should do somemore research, most that I've stayed in have been quite small. I'm sure do to the fact that the city is so populated. Paying over $500 a night was completely fine for what we got (even if our room hadn't changed) Location, just blocks from the best shopping and sites in NYC. The easy highway access and the fact that you are in such a large city and yet at this hotel you get the feel that you are in a neighborhood.

The reception was dark, dull, and smelled a sort of \"moldy\". My room which included a very comfortable bed (and that's important), was quite small, and very simple. It seemed quite worn, the carpets were stained, the bathroom OK, but with no warming so everything I put there got quite humid. The people at the frontdesk (reception) seemed a bit rude to me. They did not say hello or velcome when I arrived, and not goodbye when I left. They just replied yes og no shortly at all my questions, and they never gave a smile. As my first impression of USA in my whole life, I wondered were I had landed. After a while I still found this very strange because all other people working at the hotel were so nice, velcoming and polite. The same good impression I got of all other people I met in NY, both in business and leisure situations, during my stay. The manager which desk was right beside them also was very polite nice and helpfull. The concierges as well! What was great with the hotel were two things: The location was just fantastic! In walkingdistance to almost everything, I just loved it! And since the UN General Assembley was gathered, the traffic was a big mess, and then it was lovely just to walk the distances. And I loved the Starbucks on the next corner. The other great thing with the hotel was the fitnesscenter in 35 floor. I just loved it! Morningexercise with a great view all over The Big Apple, I cannot believe how lucky I was!!. I did just visit the restaurant for breakfast. which costed 25$. Quite expensive, but then you could eat as much as you liked and the variation was great, even though I just ate fresh strawberrys and toasted bagles everyday. Well I have to admit I was quite disappointed about mye hotelroom.

In addition, the air-conditioner in the room was noisy and turned on/off all night long.

We arrived on a Friday at 6pm to find that there were no rooms with two double beds available, that we would be put in a room with a king bed and a roll-away bed could be provided. Our reservation clearly stated our request for a double-double and we felt this was necessary for obvious reasons. Now I understand how the request process works, but there should be a policy that allows a person to guarantee a room with two double beds or allow them to look elsewhere. I realize that Marriott's cancellation policy is extremely generous (allowing cancellation up to 6pm the day of arrival), but I would be perfectly willing to be on the hook for a night's room rate with a guarantee that the bedding preference is honored. If you want to take a chance your request might not be granted in exchange for the generous cancellation policy that's fine with me. But if the request can't be guaranteed we should have an opportunity to look elsewhere for other options, not find out at 6pm on a Friday night that I have to sleep in the same bed as my father! It's just too expensive to not get the product you paid for. To her credit the front desk clerk handled the situation in a reasonably friendly manner and upgraded us to a junior suite to placate us. Other reviews have mentioned the elevator. The elevator situation is truly a horror show. It takes way too much time to get an elevator, particularly during the crunch hours. Plus, it does not engender confidence when the elevator acts a bit quirky during operation. Several elevators made odd sounds and would lurch a bit during transit. I ended up taking the sta most irsof the time. The bathroom had no vent, the TV was placed in such a way that you could not see it fully from either the bed, or the couch. Good luck finding out how to get the fitness room on the 35th floor (hint... it takes at least 2 different elevators). The sheets were nice, high thread count variety and comfortable. The room was mostly clean, although there were some beard trimmings around the sink when we checked in. The breakfast included in our room rate was reasonable. The breakfast buffet had a nice variety. Several times we went to seek the advice of the concierge and they were not stationed at their desk. The seating arrangement in the lobby bar isn't thought out very well. We also noticed the next night that the people who were riding up the elevator were eating fresh chocolate chip cookies. We asked where they got them and they said they were given out during check in. No cookies for us during our check in process. Guess that's the way the cookie crumbles.

We arrived at the hotel around 10am and the front desk wished us a happy anniversary right away, which was really nice. They were very friendly but said our room was not ready yet. They then said that we were in an excellent room so come back in a couple hours to check in. The bellhop stored our bags and we came back a few hours later. When we checked in a couple hours later and got to our room we were overwhelmed. I have stayed in a number of Marriott Hotels and was quite pleased with the room that we were given even in relation to other newer Marriott properties. It was a corner room with views of Rockefeller Center and Lexington Ave on the 23rd floor. It was huge -- much larger than an average king room at other newer Marriott hotels that I have actually paid more per night for. They gave us extra towels and pillows just like requested, and within fifteen minutes of our arrival brought up the fridge we requested as well. The room was just like brand new, the bed was amazing, and even the bathroom was wellsized with a great shower head and marble all around. Overall we could not have been more impressed with the room -- way more space and much nicer than we even expected (especially considering how little we paid)! We had turndown service every night and no street noise at all. Overall the room was top notch. I am sure that people at nicer hotels in NYC have paid much more for much less room. Other hotel services we used: -Business center was very friendly and helpful, though a little overpriced for internet at 30bucks an hour. -The bar in the lobby was great -- good drinks and friendly service. Not a trendy or hip place by any means but a good spot for a quick drink before going out. For an even better bet try the W Hotel next door, they have a bar called Whiskey Blue that is terrific. Really, our only complaint about the hotel was the concierge. If you see Michael Herbanski (sp?) behind the desk, don't bother. He was rude and unhelpful to say the least. The concierge named Topher (don't remember the last name) was much more helpful. One more great thing about the hotel was the location. You really can't beat 49th and Lexington... just a few blocks from Rockefeller Center, the theatres and Times Square. Overall, I'd give this hotel great marks for an excellent stay at a great value. I do hear that the rooms vary widely in size, so calling ahead after making a reservation might be your best bet for a good room. All in all, when we go back to the city, we will definitely stay at the Marriott East Side again!", "Date": "December 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cExceeded our expectations\u201d", "Author": "TripAdv100", "ReviewID": "UR4160889", "Content": "After reading so many negative reviews of this hotel posted at this site, I was seriously concerned about staying here during our first visit to NYC.

Had a coffee maker, shoe shine machine, beautiful terry cloth robes and lots of towels and comfortable sitting/desk area. Water pressure was a bit less than hoped for in the shower, but good for the upper floors and the age of the building. Far enough away from the elevator to not listen to folks coming up and down. There is a fair amount of waiting around for the elevators and they are certainly pokey. If you have a meeting or an appointment, factor in an extra ten minutes in case you get stuck waiting or you hear the elevator speed past your floor even though you are standing with the call button lit. Restaurant service was a bit pokey, but when we informed them every morning that we were in a bit of a hurry, they accommodated well. Food was average, but good for a hotel.

On the Sunday, one was out of order, another one stuck between floors and the queue to go up was silly ----no member of staff seemed bothered.

Eventually someone took us up to our floor in the service lift but that was only because our friends had a two year old in a pushchair. The rooms are very dull, the bathroom towels look as if they need washing before you've used them and our friends actually had damp towels placed in their room as fresh.

I stayed in three different \"king\" rooms and question whether any of the beds were actually kings (mostly queens, circa 1960!). Rooms are very small (even for NY), and are run down with carpets dirty and furniture badly in need of replacement. Bathrooms are tiny. Basically, this is one of those few Marriotts that will give you a bad idea about the chain (which is unfounded, most Marriotts are excellent). Elevators are old and slow, lobby space is unimpressive, even the gym could use new equipment. You are FAR better off at the other two Marriott mid-town locations, which are on the west side (Marquis and the Renaissance Times Square). Both of those hotels offer modern room and nicer accomodations for the same price. Even the Courtyard Marriott on the east side, with its new room renovation, is a much better choice. I will say the staff does its best in light of the unfortunate surroundings. If you are a tourist and get a great deal, maybe this is the place for you.
