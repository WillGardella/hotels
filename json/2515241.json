The hotel had a nice breakfast with excellent croissants, breads, cheese, meats, yogurt and fruit. This hotel also offers free wifi, which is not very common in France. The rooms have safes, which are part of an ongoing upgrade plan. The staff is very friendly. The hotel is a half block from the 8 Metro. While it is great to be near a Metro and a number of cafes, the street is noisy. Rooms in the front of the house have to deal with street lights on all night and car noise. Those in the back of the house appear to be smaller rooms. The lift is microscopic, with barely room for two, let alone luggage. I was not overly impressed with the luggage storage, we arrived hours prior to check in time, the hotel agreed to hold our bags until we checked in after 2pm, though our bags were simply stacked in the corner of the lobby.

It is down to the excellent staff and management that made our stay so wonderful, we were made to feel very welcome from the moment we arrived by the hotel manager Ylli and his assistant Ismael. Our room was a reasonable size and more than adequate to meet our needs. We had a lovely Queen Size bed, a very large LCD TV, antique wardrobe, dressing table, Desk, occasional table, two bed side cabinets and two arm chairs and still had plenty of room. The en-suite was fully tiled and contained a full size bath with over head shower, WC, wash hand basin and large storage cabinet. Both rooms were decorated and furnished to a high standard but for me the crowning glory had to be the two pairs of French doors leading out onto our private balcony overlooking the charming cafes, bar\u2019s and bistro\u2019s below. The area has plenty of restaurants and bars with every kind of food, from a take away pizza to a more formal dining room experience. Whether traditional, Brazilian, Chinese or gastronomic, there are an abundance of restaurants only a short pleasant stroll away. I would also recommend taking advantage of the hotel breakfast at least once, a truly charming and possibly unique experience. We felt very safe walking around this area at night. The Eifel tower, Grand Palais, L'HOTEL NATIONAL DES INVALIDES or the Place de la Concorde are all within easy walking distance. In our opinion this is a four star hotel with 5 star service. One example of this, Is when I bought my wife a bouquet of flowers and realised we didn\u2019t have a vase to display them, Once again Ismael came to the rescue and delivered a cut glass crystal vase to our room.

The neighborhood has many street cafe's, pastry shops, small grocery shops, and souvenir shops for your convenience. The rooms are quite small and housekeeping only average, but the service from the guys at the front desk was outstanding. They went above and beyond to try to help you with your needs. On a side note, if you need washrags, bring your own. Not one hotel we stayed at in London or Paris supplied wash cloths. If you stay here you will pass a street called \"Rue Cler\" between the hotel and the Eiffel Tower. Take a stroll up this street and you will find a section about 3 blocks away that is for pedestrian use only with all kinds of shops and eating places.

The room was faultless, clean, well decorated and had everything we needed for our short trip. Coffee and biscuits were provided.

We did get such a room - it made our stay more memorable as we could enjoy the early morning and late night street life in La Tour Maubourg. This is a more quite street, though! If you seek vivid night life it is not the place to go! The windows and thick curtains shut out most sounds from outside. We even slept late because of the curtains shutting out the early morning light. Being able to leave our luggage at the hotel on the last day of our trip allowed as to fully utilise the day without the burden of taking our suitcases along! The hotel is near the Eiffel, Metro and close to some shops and restaurants. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel but enjoyed croissants from a nearby pattisier.

After deciding to go for a five-day city break with my boyfriend, we read a lot of reviews and spent a lot of time choosing a good hotel in a good location. I am sorry to say I was incredibly disappointed, I feel very ripped off for the price it was and indeed the hotel had such a negative effect that it ruined my overall holiday experience. The Best Western is in a great location, but that is where the positive ends I'm afraid. We stayed on the fourth floor, with a double bed made of two singles pushed together. The room was clean and the bathroom functional and I could have lived with it, had it not been for the very high levels of noise. The hotel has a lift running up its centre, which slowly squeaks its way to the floors each time it is used. The bedroom doors are in many cases just inches away from each other and closed by a strong hinge, causing the whole room to shake each time anyone used them on any floor. Even ear plugs were no match for the lift or the very loud door bangs - so much so it made no difference at all having them in. There was also a periodic down-pour of vast amounts of water at random times of the night from the floors above. The whole air conditioning system had also been turned off by the hotel, so with the stuffy heat you had the choice of putting up with the stiffling heat or adding even more noise by having to open the window to the road noise below. On a city break you go to sight-see, do a lot of walking and generally just rely on a hotel as base to sleep in. For 157 euros a night, I expected even at the most basic of levels to be able to sleep - but it just proved impossible here. After a couple of nights of hardly any sleep I was feeling quite ill and this took away from my enjoyment of being in a place as wonderful as Paris! Other things about the hotel to note - The internet is only free if you bring your own laptop with you. Otherwise it is a mindblowing 7 Euros for 15 minutes to use it! We were told that the air conditioning was not available as this time, as they have turned the whole system off. Not a major thing, but one of the reasons we chose the hotel was because it marketed itself as having fully airconditioned rooms. I would strongly recommend other travellers to avoid this hotel. There are others in an equally good location but with better prices and service. I didn't have high expectations, but even my low expectations have been far exceeded.", "Date": "April 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, NC", "Title": "\u201cGreat room, location and price!\u201d", "Author": "etbwatson", "ReviewID": "UR23902562", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 nights.

When I arrived at my hotel on the first day, I found couple of tea-bags, coffee sticks and sugar sticks waiting for me on a hospitality tray in my room. I used them very quickly and was dissapointed they hadn't been replenished afterwards. I had to go to the reception desk and ask about some more tea-bags and sugar sticks TWICE during my 4-nights stay, though they shoud have paid attention to that after my first visit (?). When I asked about more tea-bags for the second time I was handed 1 (ONE!) tea-bag, although there was two of us - my and my girlfriend - in the room. When I asked a receptionist about ordering a pizza for me, he told me where the pizza-house is and send me there myself!!! There was an information about possibility of ordering a breakfast to the room. I tried to be nice and not bother anyone of doing it - therefore I decided to go to the dining room myself and take the breakfast upstairs, as my girlfriend wasn't feel well enough to go for breakfast to the dining room herself. When I was filling the tray with baquettes, yoghurts and another stuff, the \"breakfast lady\" who was in charge of the place came over to me and informed me that in fact I am not allowed to take the breakfast upstairs to my room, but she lets me do it this time!! And last thing: I needed to organise a transport from the hotel to the airport. I came down to the reception and give them all details about where and when I need the transport. The receptionist wrote down everything and then he made a call. Unfortunatelly there was no-one to answer, as it was evening time. The message from the answering machine said in english: \"Please call us tomorrow, we are open from 7 am\". I asked the receptionist if he can do it tomorrow or if he could hand it over to someone who would be there tomorrow to sort the thing out. Surprisingly the receptionist told me to come down to the reception myself tomorrow morning and ask about it once again to his collegue, just like he wasn't bother to deal with it. The knowledge of english language among the hotel staff is just satisfactory, but I also had to deal with one person who didn't know a word in english. The breakfast itself was very poor and there was not a big choice of what to eat. The breakfast lady would stand nearby and watch me when I was filling my breakfast tray, apparently not very happy if I took too much in her opinion, making me feel stressed and guilty at the same time. Apart from all above, the time spent at the hotel was good. If you can cope with situations like the ones described above then you will enjoy it.

For the price, we thought it was a good deal. Room was a decent size. The location was the best part about the hotel. There were a lot of nice restaurants on the streets surrounding, and a few good breakfast spots. The walk to the Eiffel Tower was not too long. And it was very close to the train and subway stations, which made it extremely easy to get around. The elevator was very tiny and slow, only 2 people with luggage could fit in it. But overall, the location was great, and the place was clean. I would stay here again (unless I win the lottery before our next trip to Paris :) )", "Date": "January 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cA very enjoyable stay\u201d", "Author": "MrsCunnie", "ReviewID": "UR6541433", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and enjoyed the experience. The location was great, the metro being just down the road, however we did notice another Best Western on the Champs Elysees which in our opinion would be a much better area to stay in should we visit Paris again. The rooms were excellent, very clean and comfortable, very much to my standard, although a little small, they were adequate, heard no noise and got a good nights sleep. My only concern was on arrival, the receptionist remained on the telephone for over 20 minutes without acknowledging or at least apologising to us, this, my husband and I found very rude. However when she did finally replace the receiever, she was very polite but the 1st impression of her had already been shown! Overall I would recommend a Best Western Hotel should they all be like the one we stayed in.", "Date": "January 2, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "BEST WESTERN Tour Eiffel Invalides", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d228704-Reviews-BEST_WESTERN_Tour_Eiffel_Invalides-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$159 - $292*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">35 boulevard la Tour Maubourg</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">7th Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75007</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515241", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d5/dd/d5dd14d0099c4e70caff03f67770bc8c1large.jpg"}}
