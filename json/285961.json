What a fantastic little place, really unique and stands out from the crowd. I stayed for three nights this past week and have only positive comments about the Weber.The room was very spacious and everything was in perfect condition. The flat screen TV and free wireless internet access were a real bonus.The small fridge was stocked with prepackaged ham, turkey, and cheese, as well as butter, jam, and nutela. In the morning they would leave fresh-baked breads and croissants at around 9AM. Since I had to depart at 8AM for my meeting, they left bread at night, but did not include croissants. While they forgot to leave the bread one night, it was no big deal as there was plenty of left-over bread from the morning before.The bathroom amenities were from Rituals (shampoo, moisturizing cream, body wash/gel) and the towels were thick enough and new looking. There was no convenient place to leave the soap or shampoo at arm level, so had to leave both on the floor; obviously just a slight inconvenience.Along that line, the stairs are very steep and I was in room 5, on the 3rd floor. If I had a really large or heavy suitcase, it would not have been fun to head up or down with the suitcase. Certainly if you are a wheelchair user or have trouble walking this is the last place for you.Room 5 was on the opposite side of the Weber bar which is open to 4AM. I could very faintly hear the music on Wednesday (I stayed Monday and Tuesday as well) and it did not bother me at all; I'm a light sleeper.Highly recommend it; I paid EUR95 the first night, E80 the following two nights (plus 5% tax). A real bargain price and surely they could charge double during summer.The location by the Leidesplein was perfect since several tram lines stop there.", "Date": "Nov 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR735657525", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "LIVEINHOuSTON"}, {"Content": "All positive but at a price Stayed 3 nights for my husbands birthday. We've been to Amsterdam on several occasions and have yet to find a hotel that we would want to return to. The city is wonderful, romantic and fun. The Weber is located on a busy road but we requested a high room at the back side which we got and so we had no problem with noise, I wouldn't like to stay at the front.The room was large (unusually so for the dam) clean, modern (really nice lights), nice bathroom and toiletries and had a fridge stocked each day, breakfast was ideal for us. I guess my only negative is the price as it's more a serviced apartment block than a hotel and you are completely left on your own. This suits us fine, but we weren't even told how to operate the coffee machine so service wasn't great. 150 euros a night is expensive (especially with the strength of the pound at the moment), so I guess a few extra touches would have been nice. The towels aren't great, and perhaps a beer in the fridge would have been a nice touch as no hotel bar or mini bar.I would have no hesitation at staying here again, but feel the price should be nearer the 100 euro mark.Plus if stairs are a problem, stay elsewhere!My hunt for the perfect hotel in the perfect city continues, does that mean I have to go again.... gutted!", "Date": "Nov 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR508641297", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "burroontour"}, {"Content": "Amazing Place!

The reviews on Tripadvisor were favorable and bang on the mark. It's location is right around the corner from the Leidsplein and just a short 10 min tram ride from Central Station (Tram 1,3 or 5 - Pay on the tram).To get in you have to ring the buzzer on arrival and climb the stairs (How Steep!!) to reception. We were a little put out that the girl on the desk had just given our room away but another was arranged without fuss. Maybe worth an e-mail the day before to confirm your arrival time!!The room was a good size - large by Amsterdam standards and although we booked a twin room, we got a double - I guess because we had the wrong room. However the beds were parted and made up to a twin without fuss. We were at the back of the hotel on the 3rd floor - less noisy and with views over a canal and other peoples apartments. Earplugs were provided as others have complained about the noise but being at the back we bearly heard a thing. The two huge windows and high ceiling lent the room an airy feel and coupled with the wooden flooring and cool prints made you feel like you were indeed in a quality, boutique establishment. The huge LCD TV had BBC1/CNN  Discovery along with the usual EuroSat stuff and the fridge and coffee machine were as mentioned in other reviews. Loved it. Coffee was good and fridge filled daily with Ham, salami, cheese, pate, yoghurt and OJ. Fresh bread arrived each morning and was more than ample for the two of us. The bathroom was very nice too with wetroom shower and large vanity.The next time I come I'll be staying here again - it's popular for a good reason so be sure to book early. If bar noise bothers you ask for a room on the 3rd + floor at the back. Lots of people outside at the front chatting till all hours.. One other note - I left my iPOD lead in the room which was posted back to me without fuss - Many Thanks Hotel Weber !!", "Date": "Oct 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR266277893", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Tony321"}, {"Content": "Loved this hotel We loved this hotel - don't go there if you like a corporate, modern place. it is very quirky - steep steps not for the infirm.We were in Room 2 which was directly above the bar and yes I used the earplugs!

I stayed here with my boyfriend for 1 night. When we arrived at 2pm the room was not ready so we went for a quick walk. The stairs where amazingly steep, you literally had to walk with you feet sideways up them. We stayed in room 2, the room was modern and clean, the animal skull above the bed was a bit scary, I was a bit worried that there were no ear plugs next to the bed as mentioned in previous reviews, but as it was Wednesday thought nothing of it, how noisy could it be?We went out around 8pm and the bar below the hotel was dead so we thought we were safe. Arrived back at half 11 to very crowded street, bikes everywhere. My boyfriend passed out so was unable to hear the noise of the music and drone of bass, by 2 am it was unbearable and I was unable to sleep, longing for 4am when it would stop.

It was an extremely pleasant experience and I definitely became a fan of the interesting accommodation concept of this hotel: make yourself at home. FROM AND TO SCHIPOL: From Schipol the cheapest and very easy way is just catch the train to central station (tickets are in the luggage rooms, you may do it while you wait for your luggage) and from Central Station the Tram 1-2-5 go to the corner of Marnikstraat at Leidsplein and from there is a 1 minute walk to the door of the hotel. LOCATION: The location is excellent, within the cool night district of Leidsplein were small trendy design bars are populated mostly with 20+ (year old) customers; the hotel itself sits above the Weber bar were the decoration concept one can find in the rooms is extended to the next level. In spite the location within this known night-life district the neighbourhood is very quiet and depending on your room, if you open the windows in the most busy nights you may perhaps hear some noise but that really didn\u9225\u6a9b disturbed us; they have disposable ear-plugs on the night-stand in case it gets to bother you. For who wants to visit the city the location is no less then excellent since it is within the Southern Canal Belt, from where you do your errands around the city heart by foot (or bike or boat if you will) and get everywhere in a 10 minute walking distance. STAFF: People are not always in the reception but from your room you can dial and the calls are redirected to the staff mobile phone which is usually 5 minute away and happy to help you. Cards for the rooms and main door are given and because breakfast are eaten in our room you likely go by days without seeing no other guests or staff. It is basically like being in an apartment but rooms are daily cleaned and refreshed and always spotless.THE HOTEL AND ROOMS: As I read in Lonely Planet, once you accepted you are going to stay in a small room for a lot of money you are ready to stay in Amsterdam, rooms are small and often even cramped. These were very spacious for what I could understand. Each room is different! They are plain but stylishly decorated in a minimal style with some oriental / ethnic and baroque notes. Loved it! The bathroom has a curtain shower and no stand, is just the plain floor. Hygiene products are, as advertised in hotel website from Rituals Home; they have hairdryer. At least our room had a small balcony with 2 chairs where after firmly closing the door to avoid the smoke to enter the room (this is a smoke-fee hotel!) we\u9225\u6a87 sometimes enjoy a cigarette; otherwise there is a retractable wooden bench in the street at the window of the bar were you can have your morning coffee (see ahead for the coffee item) and smoke. The bed is very comfortable and rooms have security safes. In each room, a small sink with and an electric cup where you can make tea available also from Home Rituals. The best to me was the BREAKFAST concept. Under the sink there is a fridge where breakfast items are available in a tray and replenished each morning: milk, yoghurt, orange juice, cheese, sausage or nutella spread, confiture and honey, a few slices of cheese and ham. Additionally there is cereal and some waffle small cookies to go with the coffee I guess, they offer it everywhere in the city. A delicious fresh bread assortment is put at a stand in a basket outside your door each morning! I think the whole ideia is is great because at night I am always hungry and usually have to buy something to keep in my hotel room. In this case, because except for bread, breakfast is already there, I feasted myself and more than enough (+ bread) was still available for a copious breakfast in the morning. The COFEE: In Portugal, my home country, coffee means expresso and nothing else. It is good (as in strong, flavoured and well extracted from well calibrated machines in the great majority of places), cheap (0.40 \u9225?1\u9227? and available everywhere. Ducth espresso was available everywhere and was very good but most definitely not cheap (2.25 2-75\u9227? even if within European standards. There is a Nespresso machine in each room with 4 daily doses available which for me was the final magic touch which lead me to fall in love with this charming little hotel. I could enjoy my espresso right after breakfast before beginning the day program, on the room, balcony or on the bench in the street looking at bikers passing by.Above all in this hotel you see in practice that stars mean little but that some standard facilities are available: concept and detail here is everything and less means more.
