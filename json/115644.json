We parked our car in their offsite garage and hauled our luggage through the rain to the hotel - I suppose it should be expected that parking is, of course, off site.

The location is excellent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is central to many sites/areas and not far from transportation. There are many great restaurants nearby. And, on both trips, I have found the staff to be super friendly (actually, all of the service we had in San Francisco was excellent). Also, the room was very clean, which is one of my most important considerations. The room isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t large, but it was fine for the two of us. The bathrooms have those deep bathtubs, which I love. Although the hotel was renovated a few years ago, it is an older hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning, if you like things modern and sleek, this probably isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the hotel for you. Our room, on the eighth floor, faced Powell Street. Once the window was shut, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too noisy. I could see noise being a problem if you stayed in warmer weather. Since the hotel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have air conditioning I imagine you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to leave the windows open. Also, oddly, the windows (ours anyway) don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have screens, so I think bugs could be a problem in warmer weather. The tv channels are limited and the cost of movies are (I think) outrageous - $16.95! \u00e2\u20ac\u201c maybe that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standard, but I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay it. Internet if free (yay!), but $10/day if you want to be able to access if through the tv. The hotel provides free coffee/tea, cold water, cookies and apples throughout the day. All of these were much appreciated for quick returns between destinations. However, the coffee was lukewarm on several occasions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c maybe it would be worthwhile to invest in better carafes?

It's a small place, only about six or so rooms on a floor, and the rooms are small but user-friendly and comfortable. We never had to wait more than a minute for the elevator. The people at the bar and downstairs restaurant and very accommodating and the restaurant is good value compared to other places around there. Their eggs Benedict was supposed to be the house special, but because I'm a vegetarian the waiter offered to make it Florentine and very tasty it was! The bar also has a decent happy hour. The only drawback was our room didn't have a very good view -- maybe a room higher up (we were on the 6th floor) and/or maybe facing Union Square (but then you might have more noise). And it didn't have a fridge. The location is superlative, half a block from Union Sq., the Powell/Hyde cable car goes right past, and a lot of great restaurants and watering holes are within walking distance. One day we walked all the way to Pier One of the Embarcadero and then along the waterfront up to the Powell/Hyde cablecar for the ride back. A long walk but lots of fun. It was very brisk weather while we were there so we appreciated being able to duck out of the hotel and to have a choice of places to go within a three-block radius. While you're there check out the little concierge/gift stand in the lobby.

There were 2 adults in our party and we booked a room with 2 twin beds. We absolutely loved this hotel. Our stay @ the Chancellor came at the tail end of a nearly 10 day trip to the Bay Area so we were looking for clean yet comfortable accommodations. We were very happy that we chose to stay @ the Chancellor. First off, the location cannot be beat. If you are a tourist looking for a good home base in city from which to start your exploration and site seeing, this is a wonderful spot. The hotel is centrally located to NUMEROUS modes of public transit - i.e. the Powell-Mason cable car line stops in front of the hotel, it's about a 5 minute walk to the Powell Street BART station (goes directly to SFO which is approximately 40 minutes away), the Market and 5th area is a cluster for many buses and street cars, etc. It's so easy to get around from here. And please do not think that it'll be noisy in your hotel room given that you're so close to all the action. Our room overlooked the front of the hotel -Powell Street - and I was amazed at how well our window blocked out the sounds of the people, of the cable cars, etc. I was so impressed with the sound proofing of the window. SIDEBAR: A helpful note to 1st time travelers to SF: the city has an impressive web of mass transit. However, unlike NYC where all the city buses are all with the MTA, SF has multiple transit agencies that oversee its public transportation and they don't necessarily cross honor each other's tickets. So the best route is to purchase a Clipper card from a Walgreens or similar retailer as that is card is rechargeable and accepted by all the transit agencies (BART, MUNI, etc.). It is also worth noting that steps away from the hotel is a Walgreens pharmacy and 7-11 (which surprisingly sold deliciously fresh glazed donuts - so good that they rival NYC's beloved Krispy Kreme). There's tons of other shopping near the hotel - Macy's, Sack's Ross, etc. Second, the staff was very pleasant and helpful. They were always friendly and willing to answer all our questions. Third, the Chancellor has the wonderful feel of a boutique hotel without the designer price tag. I myself am not a big fan of the gigantic convention center-esque hotel experience. The Chancellor feels so intimate. The hotel was originally opened in 1914 and the decor is reflective of that era. So though the lobby may not be flanked with flat screen TVs and sleek modern furniture, the property appears to be well maintained. My friend and I did quite a bit of research before booking here and found that the prices of the Chancellor were some of the most affordable in the area. Having now stayed at the hotel, we know that we didn't sacrifice any quality for the price. Fourth, the hotel is clean with comfortable amenities. I do want to caution folks that in a dense city like SF or New York, your typical hotel room will tend to run pretty small. The size of our room at the Chancellor was modest, but we never felt like we were on top of each other. It was definitely a plus that our room came with a walk in closet. The bathroom had a glorious classic bathtub that's perfect for soaking. The room came with free WiFi internet as well. There were also wonderful little perks like free coffee and tea and cookies in the lobby throughout the day. If we had to, one SMALL issue we did have was with how the elevators (of which there are 2) were rather slow at times. And even this was not a big issue at all. All in, we loved our time in San Francisco and loved our time at the Chancellor hotel. We would definitely return to the Chancellor and would not have any qualms in recommending this place to friends.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachussetts", "Title": "\u201cLocation and price point is great, BUT.......Not a hotel if you need real internet\u201d", "Author": "tman12", "ReviewID": "UR122847120", "Content": "I agree with every other review about location....couldn't be better and price is good.

It was wonderful. I picked based on trip advisor. I don't know how anyone has ever had a problem with it - it exceeded my high expectations. I cannot really add much to what has been said. Rooms are perfectly adequate in size. Bed, television, chairs and a little room for your suitcase. They're not big, but if you've been to Europe, they're bigger than that. I requested a view of union square up high - was aware i might get a little noise but the windows block a lot out (except for the San Francisco noises you want to hear, like cable cars and soft bugle playing!) and this stopped by the time i was headed to bed. I had a lot more noise on the out skirts of New York. Also the view of Union Square was wonderful, and I loved knowing where I was. I was on the 11th floor but up higher might get an even better view. The quality of housekeeping and furnishings is excellent. For the price I was blown away by what we received. The service from staff was the best I received from our stay. Check in, check out, porter, tour desk, everything was great. Yes the bathroom is small, but I don't know who wants to spend time in their bathroom. I will stay here again in a heartbeat and recommend it to anyone who wants somewhere clean, central, not too expensive and focused on making the experience great for guests. Location cannot be beat. Public transport in SF is incredible. I was able to shop as a young female on my own into the evening because we were so close to the stores and a lot of foot traffic around. Really hope that the Chancellor doesn't change - the price, the quality of service and the rooms are everything I hoped for. Tips: 1. We requested a fridge as soon as we arrived and it was delivered promptly. What a great free service! 2. The tour desk sells MUNI passes - we got our moneys worth as the hills of SF are killer, and sometimes it's very easy to hop on a bus/trolley. 3. The cable car stops basically outside, but at peak tourist time (or at least when we were there) the line up to get on them is insane, so we didn't try to use it. 4. You can catch the BART to Powell St station for $8.10 from the airport - pretty cheap if you're on your own or in a pair. That said, it's about a 7-10 minute walk up a gentle-moderate slope with tourist traffic and lights. It is certainly doable, but I had 2 suitcases so it wasn't a stroll in the park.

Open windows were a plus since we don't like it too warm at night. Loved the green accent wall, the rubber ducky in the bathroom and very nice shampoo/conditioner/lotion (organic no less). Loved the bar and bartender Rory, where we took advantage of a two-for-one coupon and happy hour to have a relaxing drink - Rory was very friendly. Hotel is 1/2 block from Union Square, which was alive with people, ice skaters, music, performers, a giant Christmas tree and the lighting of the first Chanukah candle on a giant menorah. The shops were decorated, Macy's had a wreath in every window. We walked all over. In the morning, Sears Fine Food is just up the block, a famous breakfast somehow I've never sampled.

You'll be proud of yourself for being so smart. Friendly, smiling and helpful staff throughout the whole hotel - Voula, Olga, JeSara, Rory, Karla, Harris, Alicia at the bar, Mao in the restaurant, as well as our housekeeper, and the engineer who got the heat going nicely in our room. We hadn't been to San Francisco in 2 years, but Rory and Alicia remembered us! The rooms are beautiful with very comfortable beds and pillows, flat screen tv's, roomy closet with a safe, and an umbrella to borrow in the case of rain. Bath salts are provided for soaking in the huge bathtub after a day of enjoying the greatness of San Francisco. I'm kicking myself for forgetting to bring home my rubber ducky from the bathroom to commemorate my birthday trip and great stay! The lobby is cozy, with delicious cookies and coffee available throughout the day. We had breakfast at Luques twice, and it was very good. Our waiter Mao used to live in my hometown - small, small world. We had an especially good time with him. This location is absolutely excellent. Cable car a few steps from the front door. Great shopping in Union Square a few steps. 24 hour Walgreen's a few steps. Chinatown just 3 or 4 blocks. At the tour counter in the lobby, be sure to get your Muni pass for unlimited rides on the city's great transportation system including cable cars, buses, and streetcars. Great bus routes and the F-line streetcar are quite convenient to the hotel. An e-mail to the wonderful Mr. Wes Tyler prior to my birthday visit last week resulted in an unexpected upgrade to a 2-room suite on the top floor, with a view of Union Square, as well as welcoming gifts in the room - a birthday card, a picture frame, champagne and flutes. So thoughtful. So gracious. Wow and double wow. San Francisco is wonderful, and I look forward to many more visits. I use the word great many times in this review. This hotel, the city and its people deserve all the \"greats\" I give to them. And I'm so grateful to tripadvisor and fellow travelers for helping me to find this gem of a hotel. If a clean, cozy, charming older building with beautiful rooms, modern amenities, dedication to service and a great location appeals to you, you're home here. It's 5 stars in our book.

The valet parking worked well, as long as you remembered to request your car 25 minutes or so in advance. The only complaint was trying to find the right temperature for the rooms.

It's also nice to be able to hit Happy Hour at your own hotel before heading to a show. While it's not a large hotel, it gives you more of that feeling of going back to your own apartment at the end of the day than that sterile feeling you sometimes get from a larger property. It's not unusual for me to get tired of a hotel after a few days, but that did not happen at the Chancellor. It's in a perfect location when you are using public transportation to get around. Same as last time, all the employees I came in contact with were friendly and helpful. I asked for a refrigerator this time and it was very handy to have.

We were given Room 1509, a corner room at the top floor, in the back of the hotel. While the view wasn't spectacular by any means, we appreciated being able to keep both windows open without the noisiness of the street. The room was small, as expected, but with a large walk-in closet so that you could maximize what living space you do have by stowing your things away. The room was updated with newer decor, furnishings and electronics, but since it is an older hotel, it was only slightly rough around the edges (wall, window, older bathroom). The hotel offers a cute pillow menu, which we didn't take advantage of, unfortunately. The bed was a little stiff for my liking, but my husband had no problem with it in the least. There is an adjacent restaurant (which we never used) and a tiny bar where we shared a drink and watched a football game. The tour desk was helpful in providing us MUNI passes, information regarding booking a rental car (we decided against it in the end), maps and brochures for area attractions and securing a limo for the ride back to the hotel. The most important thing, however, was that it was very clean and comfortable and of course, in an excellent location off Union Square, near all the shopping and dining you could want and across the street from Starbucks (bonus!) and a few doors down from Walgreens (when your feet and back are dying for Advil after a whole day of climbing hilly streets).

I also knew that there was no AC, so I can't blame the hotel for this. We had a high room with an Union Square view, and had no problems sleeping at night. Location is superb. It's a block from Union Square, right next door there's a great breakfast at Sears Fine Foods, across the street there's a great restaurant called Scala's Bistro, and a 24 hour Walgreens on the same block.

Back to the hotel to checked in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c got high floor, room-facing Powell St.(requested in advance thru email which was responded promptly). Found a bottle of wine and small box of chocolate on the cocktail table \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nice touch, thanks! Room has 32\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd flat tv on top of dresser with a marble? top. Next to it is a table/chair with lamp (with a/c outlets) and telephone. Chairs are on each side of the cocktail table by the window. There are end tables with lamps on each side of the queen bed-one with a clock radio. Pillows and bed were very nice and comfortable. Ceiling fan produced enough circulation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c vibration/noise is noticeable at top speed but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the preferred setting anyway. Noise from cable cars, construction (Stockton & Post) and everything else going on (Powell/Union Square/HVAC of the building across the street) is on a medium high level with the window in full open position. I could not close it fully as the room gets too hot for our taste. Although, I think the noise level will be much better when the road constructions are over. Bathroom size is fine, the only really complaint is how close the potty is to the door. Wi-Fi signal was very good and VPN connection worked properly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for free! Closet has iron/board and a safe big enough to fit a 15.6 laptop with plenty of clothes hangers and an umbrella too (came in handy for a few rainy days/nights). The Icebox is nicely hidden inside a closet by the elevator. The elevators are quick and seem to handle the traffic very well. Hotel is central to all public transit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cable car at Powell, buses at Post, Sutter or Stockton. I believe BART is a short walk as well. Muni passport can be bought at the tour desk. Hotel is practically next door to major shops \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Saks, NM, Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Bulgari/Tiffany, Uggs and more. Ditto for different restaurants/bars. Only used the hotel restaurant for breakfast (3x) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c food was very good with great service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with 20% off for conference attendees. There is a small bar by the lobby where the free coffee is (didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t particularly liked the flat taste/flavor), but has very good selection of tea bags. On several occasions, the thermos for coffee or hot water ran dry, although they were replenished quickly. There were also free cookies and fruits available for guests. All the staff seems genuinely friendly, from the front desk, bellhop, tour desk, restaurant wait/help, maintenance & maids. Normally, there will be staff(s) that are indifferent but not at this hotel, at least not the ones we encountered in our 6 nights stay. The hotel is a very good (4.5) 3 star property.

The hotel itself is nice and a perfect location if you want to be in Union Square. The rooms are small but well designed and really clean. Although the walls are paper thin so just hope you don't get noisey neighbours! The concierge was very helpful with organising tickets and shuttle buses. I even heard him helping other guests to try and get sold out alcatraz tickets. He really seemed to try hard to accommodate. The free tea, coffee and cookies somewhat makes up for there being no breakfast but sure there are pleanty of places around to grab breakfast. Our only complaint during our stay was the bar. The barmaid appeared to have some friends in the bar one of the nights which actually drove us out of the hotel for the evening. They were so loud and obnoxious that we left to get a drink elsewhere.

We did a lot of research before hand including for bedbugs and we are glad we had picked this hotel. Chancellor Hotel is not the best of the best; however, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the worst either. Location was good and the price was decent. PARKING: If you drive here, parking in SF is NOT free; $29/night PLUS tax, which I thought was ridiculous with the tax. Chancellor hotel will have complimentary cookies, water, apples, maps, tea and coffee in the lobby all for FREE! SERVICE: The staffs here were nice and friendly. The tour desk guy was really helpful with info about places to go and how to get there. Our room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a fridge, we call and requested one and they brought it up to our room right away at no charge. BEDROOM: The bedroom is exactly like what you see in the pictures. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small but cozy. If you can take advantage of the pillow menu, I suggest you should. I had forgotten about it; therefore, some nights I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep on their pillows (the fabric makes too much noise). The room has no air condition, but a ceiling fan. They also have free Wi-Fi, a flat screen TV, closet, umbrella, a safe, and an ironing board. BATHROOM: The bathroom was small but decent. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like how the toilet paper was right against the wall on top of you. You have to actually twist your back around to get it. They should have placed it on the wall in front of you (near the towels) instead of on top of you. That was a disadvantage for me. We had stayed in a remodeled room but my bathtub didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look like it was remodeled at all. The paint had peeled off and you will see paint holes in your tub. LOCATION: You will find lots of shopping places and restaurants right outside of Chancellor. Chancellor is near a lot of the popular attractions like: fisherman wharf, Chinatown, Lombard St, etc. The cable cars are right in front of the hotel so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very convenient to go to these places. You can buy the Muni pass right there at the tour desk to try it out. Some of the farther places like the Golden Gate Park, GG Bridge, and Palace of Fine Arts were better off if you take your own car. The cable cars don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to these places. Waiting for the Muni buses will waste a lot of time and they are always full. We drove instead of taking the buses and were glad we did. HOUSEKEEPING: Everyday cleaning lady always cleaned our room. She gave us extra soap and towels, which was nice of her. NOTE: There will be plenty of homeless people everywhere you go including right outside of Chancellor Hotel. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry because Chancellor is located where there are lots of people around you so you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be alone, kind of like being in New York. We even came prepared with pepper spray just in case, but never even use them.

Although, I did not hear noise from the neighboring rooms, the noise from outside the hotel was unbelievable. I checked the windows twice to make sure they were closed. It sounded like the street was running right through the room. The windows are not double paned and they are useless in blocking out noise. I felt like I should tip the street musicians on Union Square since it sounded like they were playing in my room. Powell Street is very busy and the noise did not diminish all night. There is no air conditioning and the evening was quite warm. I thought I would be saved by the ceiling fan. In theory, this would provide some cooling air and some white noise. However the fan was so poorly mounted to the ceiling, that even at the lowest speed it shook so badly I was certain it would fall out at any moment. Further it had a noisy and irregular rattle that added to the general cacophony. I would suggest that future guests insist on a room away from the street and check out the ceiling fan before settling in.

We stayed there 3 nights and walked down to Powell and Market St. to catch the bus towards Embarcadero/Ferry Building. (We came back on BART to test the subway. TIP: cheaper to pay Bart $1.75 than the $2 bus fare.) We also got on the 38 bus that rides out west on Geary Ave. The central location also puts you in the heart of shopping action, many stores within a 3 block radius. We wanted to try Sears restaurant next door for breakfast but the line was too long, so we took out from Starbucks at the corner of Powell and Sutter. At the opposite corner, there is a drugstore to pick up beverages, snacks and other conveniences. Our two best meals were at Slanted Door (Ferry Building) and Empero Taste on 42nd St. near the Golden Gate Park. We tried Fino Ristorante in Andrews Hotel on Post Street \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but it turned out not so fino. Back to the Chancellor Hotel. Overall, we were satisfied with the room for the price we paid. We had two twin beds in a very small room that also included a desk and chair, flatscreen tv on a bureau of drawers, and two more chairs around a small \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coffee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd table. I was put off by the poor lighting in the bedroom; you have to turn on all the lights to see properly. Fortunately, with all lights on, it was adequate. I laughed at another reader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comment that the closet was larger than the bathroom. True! Actually, we had to keep closet closed at all times (losing the use of the full-length mirror on the door) because of the horrible odour. It smelled like 1864 in there. The bathroom could use some design tricks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one skimpy towel bar to carry six towels (2 sets of towels) was not wide enough to hang used towels\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Why not install a pivoting towel bar on the wall? Only one short hook on the back of the door\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Why not install a double hook? Hardly any counter space, certainly not for two people. The best thing in the room was the bed linen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pillows and duvet. Sadly, the same could not be said of the bed mattresses, which sagged in the middle. There is no a/c in the small room, so fortunately, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need it. If you go in months hotter than Sept, you may want to find another hotel. Such a small room without a/c can be claustrophobic. In the hotel lobby, you can do web check-in for your flight boarding pass. Very handy. While not the best hotel experience, other hotels were charging $20-40 more per night for about the same quality.

I did quite a bit of research before deciding on The Chancellor. For the price it was perfect. There are lots of high end hotels around it, but for comfort and value this can't be beat. The hotel: very clean public areas, very friendly staff. My room was still being cleaned when I arrived so went and grabbed a bite and came back. Very friendly bellman retrieved my stored luggage and escorted me up to my room. NOTE: I was impressed with the elevators. There were only two and I was staying on the 13th floor, and they always arrived promptly and moved quickly. The rooms are small but comfortable and nicely appointed. I was traveling alone so the smallness didn't bother me as much as if I had had my wife along. The closet was HUGE. Lots of hanging space with safe, ironing board, umbrella and portable heater all inside with still lots of room for my luggage to sit on the luggage rack. I agree with several reviewers that you should request a high floor. It can get noisy, especially the cable car bell that dings constantly. And there is no A/C, but the open window and ceiling fan keep the room cool (and I was there during a SF \"heat wave\": 80 degrees! Location is fantastic. 1/2 block to Union Square with shopping and dining galore. I walked the neighborhood and found tons of restaurants, both chains and independent. Scala's is right across the street who's chefs were both on Top Chef. I just ordered a takeaway margarita pizza and it was delish. Transportation is easy to secure. The SF MUNI system is very efficient. While there is a cable car stop right out the hotel door, by the time it gets there from it's origin at the base of Powell street, it was always full. I did catch it early one morning around 8:30 and it wasn't bad. Walk about 2 blocks and you can catch a trolley car to Fisherman's Wharf. The trolley cars are old restored trolley cars from various cities. The city name is printed on the side. I rode one that was from Milan, Italy and still had signs in Italian. They literally are \"museums on wheels.\" And BART line is right there as well, which you can take to and from the airport. I also rode it into Oakland to go to a Rangers/A's game and it was great.

The hotel itself is right on Union Square so is good if you are wanting to get onto transport or tour buses. There are trams right out front and the tour buses all line up outside Macy's across the road. The hotel itself was nice - while we were there they were re-painting the lobby. The hotel style is sort of like the old victorian style buildings so don't expect modern or sleek at this hotel (not in a bad way). The roooms were tiny - probably the smallest rooms I've ever stayed in but I hear this is normal for San Francisco, especially if you're on a budget. The rooms were clean and tidy, the bed comfy and they had a pillow menu which we didn't use but I thought was a great idea. The bathroom was even smaller and the thing I found funny was that the closet was almost bigger than the bathroom. I would prefer a larger bathroom than some closet space as I just leave my stuff in my suitcase when I'm at hotels, but that's just my opinion. We only went to the bar for an hour or so one night and it's really small so it's not really designed for if you're looking for a night out. There was a market a couple of blocks away from the hotel where we were able to buy beer, toiletries and general stuff. We asked the concierge where we could eat - we aren't foodies so we generally look for averaged priced restaurants, nothing fancy. We were advised that there was a pizza place a few blocks away that was good. As we had spent the whole day travelling to San Fran we weren't looking forward to the hike up the hills to find this place and as we stood outside we noticed right next door a place called Sears Fine Food. After looking at the menu this is exactly the place we were looking for. Reasonably priced food - steaks, pasta, that kind of stuff. The food was great we ate here for dinner twice and breakfast twice. I have no idea why the concierge didn't tell us there was a restaurant right next door. We also used the concierge to book a hop on hop off tour and a city. We are usually the kind who likes to explore on our own but as we only had two days here we wanted to get the most out of the two days. The hop on hop off wasn't worth it. They were meant to loop around ever 15-30mins and we got off to look at the crookedest street and we waited over and hour for them to come back, in the end we rang the tour company to find out if they were going to come back for us! They did come but it was annoying because it took precious time from our schedule. In saying all this, this was nothing to do with the hotel itself. All in all a nice hotel and one of the cheaper around San Francisco.

I picked this hotel from the fantastic reviews from other travellers in Tripadvisor. There is no regrets thereafter. From the moment I started making reservations, the manager, Wes Tyler has been very very very helpful. As we have driven in from LA, we had done a lot of shopping along the way and one of the purchase was a Tumi luggage which we have ordered in Carmel and to be delivered to Chancellor in SF. So i wrote to the hotel informing them that this luggage might be delivered even before our arrival. One of the reservation officers Kevin Vossen responded to my mail and said he has contacted Tumi and has been told the luggage will arrive in a few days time. It is really nice of him to take the initiative. They also took good care of our luggage when we were away for a few days (we went to vegas). And during those few days during our absence, the stuffs we ordered from Amazon were delivered to the hotel and were delivered to our rooms the moment we came back. There are several big hotels around Chancellor but I love the personal attention given by small boutique hotels. The rooms are beautifully furnished. The bed is very very comfortable and they also has a pillow menu. When we checked in, there was a bottle of champagne and a box of chocolates welcoming our arrival. On the second checked-in, there was a photo frame, with a bottle of champagne too. The frame is a very nice momento from the hotel and It is now sitting on top of my study desk :) The location is fantastic, right in the middle of Union Square and within 10mins walk to Chinatown. Taking the cable car was no hassle at all and all there are tons of shops like Macy's, H&M, Gap are all within 5mins walk! There is also a Victoria Secret beside the hotel. It is also a very centralised location for taking cab everywhere. We joined Dylan's tour and the pick-up point is just around the corner. There are many restaurants in the area so food is not an issue. As we are from Asia, we missed asia food after 2 weeks in the states and we found 2 very good thai restaurants there!

Next the rooms are great, very comfortable bed, pillow menu with a choice of a dozen pillows. All the usual room amenities tv, iron, safe, toiletries, rubber duck, ceiling fan. We were there during the height of summer and didn't need any air con, the ceiling fan was more than sufficient. Also noise was not an issue as some other reviews have stated. As we were on honeymoon we even received a bottle of champagne, chocolates and even a photo frame as a present. The hotel bar is great for cocktails and Rory the bar tender gave us some fantastic recommendations for restaurants. Scala the Italian across the road is very good. We also ate at a plae called First Crush which was a few blocks away and very good too. The coffee, cookies and popcorn available in reception all day every day is a lovely touch.

I had emailed the hotel and requested a room on a higher floor on the backside as some reviews said it could be very noisy. We had room 1505 and I had no problems with noise. There aren't rooms on either side so we didn't hear anyone else at any time. The only noise we heard was from the ice machine which was on the other side of the shower. ( No big deal ) At night, as we were facing Union Square, it was quiet as long as we had the window closed. We ate breakfast in the hotel one morning, it was good! Our waiter was hilarious and the food was really good, and a little cheaper than other restaurants in the same area. For the price the hotel was perfect, the hotel was awesome the staff was great, not single complaints here! It was really nice to have the pillow menu, they have... 8, 10? on the menu that you can chose from, that was a really nice added touch. A few recommendations... The hotel is walking distance to the Wharf, Ferry Terminal and all the touristy spots. It took maybe.. 30? 45? minutes to walk to the Wharf, but is a beautiful walk. You can walk through China Town to avoid the hills if that's easier for you. When you arrive you get a package, there's a $5 off coupon for Bike and Roll bike rentals. We rented our bikes from there for $27, other places were a bit more expensive ( up to $35 at some places) I would definately recommend biking from the Wharf over the Golden Gate Bridge and into Sausilito (sp?) The ride isn't to bad ( a few hills ) and beautiful views of the bridge along the way. Riding over the bridge is just something you need to do, it's a great fun experience and a beautiful ride ( my bf even proposed while we were stopped on the bridge :) ) I would also recommend walking to the Ferry Terminal and buying fresh bread and cheese and having a picnic where you can find a spot. The ferry Terminal has awesome shops and restaurants that you shouldn't miss. All in all, San Francisco is a wonderful city and the Chancellor Hotel is the perfect place to spend your vacation.

It is a city centre location so expect a little noise, but it wasn't any more than we expected and we were never very disturbed by it.

On our last day here we discovered that if you go up the little spiral staircase from the lobby there is a tiny lending library just outside the bathrooms, nice touch! We only ate breakfast once in the hotel restaurant, it was nice (kinda hard to screw up scrambled eggs too much) and the prices what I would expect in a hotel. We'd recommend walking a couple of minutes up hill to the next block and eating in the diner, great prices and great breakfast. Also, don't miss out on a piece of decadent cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory on the roof of Macy's. Great views of Union Square from here too. Highly recommend the night-time tour of Alcatraz island too, it was one of the best tours I've ever been on.

The character of the hotel was evident and we appreciated that, no problems with elevator waits that sort of thing. Check in went pretty smooth, but I must say we got lucky I believe because I was able to get a parking spot pretty quick for the unloading of our bags, this could be a issue for sure if you had to circle block. I drove to the parking garage myself easy just around corner and from there its a valet service so if you have a valet key, bring it. The small lounge in the hotel was nice to use on occasion, and the complimentary cookies,coffee,tea, and papers were appreciated. The restaurant in hotel we only went to once for breakfast so sorry not much info there,we also requested a fridge for our room and got that at no charge. Overall we were happy with our stay, with the high price of parking in the city the ability to stay right down in Union Square was wonderful for us, this was our 3rd time in S.F. and the first time we stayed close to the square, very safe. We also might recommend for people that sleep in a king bed at home, getting the twin option might be the way to go by know means the hotels fault because there is no space but queen beds are a little lacking, pillows and bedding are very nice. Check out was easy but again I recommend a early start on the day if driving as traffic heading out of town is minimal, and be warned depending on what time you drive into S.F. it can be very busy at tool booth, so plan accordingly. Check out Sears Diner next door, as well as the places in Little Italy, lots of great food.

The thin walls weren't a problem, either.

My 80 year old father joined us for the last night. Everything about it was good, from the check in to the rooms and most definitely the location. In fact we raved about it to fellow passangers on the cruise. We decided to stay the one night back in San Francisco after the cruise before flying out to Honolulu and booked it through the hotel. However...................... we arrived at 9.30 am to a very surly welcome by the two gentlemen on reception. I won't mention their names but I am sure if the management is remotely interested they can check on 14th June. The rooms were not ready which is absolutaly fine as we did not expect them to be. We left our luggage in storage. We returned at 11am as we were to meet some old friends there. My father asked if there was any indication of when rooms would be ready and was told again, \"check in is at 3pm\" and that maybe, maybe by 2pm. We returned at 2pm as Dad was flagging. He was given his room but in a rude and unhelpful manner. We asked for our bags as there was nobody to get them despite the two gents and no other customers just 1 meter from luggage room. Eventually I asked them to call the porter who came. We helped Dad up to his room and returned to the lobby. Now this is not a large area. We sat directly opposite the front desk on one of the two sofas, used the computer behind the desk and waited, and waited. These two gents knew we we were waiting to check in. People came and went, a lot of laughter and chitchat went on. Eventually the shift changed. They avoided any eye contact. There was no hand over, it seemed, to oncoming shift. Eventually at 1545 I approached one of the the new team and she seemed surprised and said the room had been ready for sometime and was an upgrade to a suite. I was very annoyed as I got the distinct impression that this was done on purpose. We were tired and fed up and I do realise that the rooms have to be cleaned ect but it was like checking into two different hotels on each visit.

The room was tastefully decorated, but you should be prepared for not too much space. We where given a room overlooking union square which was really nice. The check in staff where really helpfull with dining recommendations and car rental enquiries. This is a great base for getting around the city. We only had 2 nights but we stayed midweek and got a great rate of $125 a night for this hotel. That was a bargain for a hotel in this location of this quality There are many many great restuarants close by, but Sears next door is excellent and famous enough for its brekfast that is has lines out the door for half hour or so!

Did consider asking if we could swap, but my wife (typical Englishwoman!) did not want to cause a fuss so we stayed put. In the end the room was fine and we were out exploring most of the time anyway so it was no big deal. Didn't visit the bar and restaurant as there is so much choice locally, but all the staff were friendly and helpful. It was our first visit to San Francisco and we loved the city - so much to do and see, we could have stayed a week and cannot wait to go back again one day. If you want a base at a reasonable price in a great location, then I would recommend The Chancellor, just don't expect The Ritz or Vegas size suites as you will be disappointed! p.s.

The Chancellor met and exceeded all my expectations! We loved the historic charm, comfortable room, location, view of Union Square, friendly staff, and on-site Luques Restaurant. Definitely go for the restaurant gift card as it's worth it for breakfast and/or lunch (and their staff is so friendly! We loved Mac...I think that's his name). For lunch--order the house-made chip as your side--deliciously crispy! Nearby, our favorite restaurant had to be Uncle Vito's--a local Italian joint just a short walk up Powell (a friendly Chancellor maintenance man recommended this). Right there on the Powell line, we opted for the 7-day Muni pass, which we certainly got our money's worth out of by riding cable car, street car, and bus (works for subway/underground rail too, but we didn't use that). To get to this awesome hotel from airport, I highly recommend using Go! Lorrie's Shuttle. $15 per person, make reservations ahead of time, and easy pick-up. Chancellor hotel tour desk has $1 off discount coupons for your trip back to the airport using Go! Lorrie's. Other recommendations: enjoy the sounds of street performers and special events in Union Square by having your window open. Makes for a nice breeze, too! We loved our stay here, and given the opportunity, will surely come back. There is so much charm to The Chancellor. I could tell that from day one upon my friendly greeting in the hotel lobby and once seeing the infamous yellow rubber duckie waiting for us in our bathroom. Too cute!

Our preferences for a quiet room were fulfilled perfectly - top floor, in the back. No view but good protection from street noise. Not perfect, but you'll never get country quiet in the middle of a city. Actually, we could hear the clang of the cable car over the general (low-level) noise. This was cool - a frequent reminder of the great city we were in. Yes, the room was small, especially the bathroom. However it somehow didn't feel that small. My wife loved the mirrors all over the bathroom (including a magnifying one) that made it feel bigger, but also was great for checking out her hair from all angles. And the room itself seemed to be set up quite efficiently. Maybe the high ceilings also give a sense of more space. Didn't hear any noise from other rooms or the hallway. But then, things were built a lot more solidly a century ago. One neat thing you should take advantage of: they have a big selection of specialty pillows you can try out for free. A big surprise was the restaurant. We had an excellent breakfast there a couple of times. This is a city of good food, albeit a bit pricey. The hotel restaurant gave quick service with quality food at prices below the other nearby places. We stayed seven nights, giving us time to check out the ins and outs of SF, not just the major tourist trophies. In that time, we could not think of a single complaint in the Chancellor. (Okay - just one: the wireless internet was abysmally slow.) If we return to SF, there's no question the Chancellor will be our first choice of hotel.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cwould stay here again\u201d", "Author": "georgeybaby", "ReviewID": "UR103462664", "Content": "initially i got off on the wrong foot with this hotel. we arrived early (2 hours before check in) but were told no rooms were avaliable yet. i was so tired from jet lag and had an upset tummy that had been bothering me for days, i looked like death warmed up, all i wanted was a place to rest and a shower. in the end our room wasn't even ready at check in time. my husband went to the desk to repeatedly check on the room status and in the end the front desk lady had to go to find the cleaners herself to check if the room had been done. my husband said to them, give us any room please, we really just need to rest, meanwhile i'm just about asleep on the lobby lounge and asking to use their bathroom every half an hour (which requires a key pass) and other people checking in after us got rooms before us (and as far as i know, all the rooms are the same). now i KNOW that check in time means check in time, but many other times when we have travelled, if we have gotten there early, and the room is not ready, we get the response of 'the room allocated to you is not ready but if you would like the same type of room on a lower floor/different view/whatever we can give that to you'. i was REALLY hoping this was the case as i seriously just wanted to walk out in front of a bus at high speed i felt so crappy. but it was not to be! however, once in the room, the room was great. clean, fresh, housekeeping was great, internet adequate (sometimes very slow), view was nice (looking towards macy's) and as it was our wedding anniversary they left us a nice bottle of wine and some (wierd fruit) chocolates and a card, which was nice. we also got a $75 card for the in house restaurant which covered 3 of 4 meals for us, AWESOME! check in aside, this hotel was great. i would still stay here again. i think it was alot of bad timing and circumstance that we had an initial poor experience. any other time i would have been happy to dump luggage and toddle off to have a look around. by the end of the trip i felt much better though. and i fell in love with san franscisco. do mr toads tours (3 hour tour) and check out the haight ashbury district for vintage shopping.", "Date": "April 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cChancellor Hotel in a great location!

Our rooms are perfect and I make sure I get the large walk-in closet for plenty of room to store my acquired \"treasures\". The most perfect touch is the rubber ducky....my daughter has collected every one I've taken home, noting date and occasion on the bottom of each.

Front desk was professional, helpful and competent. Soda, water and snacks were available for a reasonable price, and there were ice machines on every floor. The hotel feels classy and refined, with lots of brass and glass. Classic and tastefully understated decor. I rearranged the chairs in the room to give us a little more space -- but everyone says the rooms in SF are always tiny. Our room was small but not tiny. The bed was very comfortable. I didn't realize that they didn't have king beds, but the queen room we had (for a very reasonable price) was more than adequate. Great mattress and pillows. We didn't feel cramped. We are average sized people. If you are larger, you could request room with two twin beds and possibly put them together for a king?

In all cases the Chancellor delivered which is great. Spent 10 nights here back in December, Christmas season which is a great time to be in this area. Having never been to SF before I didnt really know where to stay, was attending a conference at the Moscone centre so somewhere around Union Square made sense. The Chancellor is an old hotel, and one thing old hotels usually have going for them is Location, as they were there first. As such the location is great, for a tourist couldnt be better. So close to Union square, cable cars, shops and the like, I caught the train in from the airport and its a 5 min walk away which is very convenient. For me its probably as far from Moscone as you would want to be walking anyway but no problem. There is a mountain of stuff nearby, ranging from a walgreens nearly next door to fine dining, entertainment and shopping. I was on business so it wasnt really a choice, but if i wasnt I would imagine there is a choice, do i stay here in union square or down by fishermans wharf. Having been there, i would say union square is a better choice - its easy enough to get down to waterfront be it cable cars or buses or whatever, but there is more stuff around and happening at union square in my opinion. The room was not big, but I have been in a lot smaller, I was slightly horrified when I saw it was on level 3 initially due to potential noise, but my room was at the back with a stunning vista of some air conditioners and a wall. Saying that, I could care less about the view more about noise, and apart from a slight hum from said air conditioners there was none so that suits me grand. The bathroom was fine and it had a bath and the provide bath salts which is a nice change. I actually quite liked the look of the room, it was sort of older styled but was quite nice, had a desk to work at and a nice large lcd tv. The lobby is small, and somehow pretty cluttered with a lot going on, they offer free cookies an apple bowl, and tea and coffee all free, which was nice. I didnt really have a lot of opportunity to interact with the hotel staff to much, so cant really comment on them or the bar etc, although the bar did seem to be busy at times so must have been ok .. A couple of points that were not so good. 1) The wireless internet, its free, which is great, problem is , in the mornings and evenings its slooooooow you get time outs in webpages let alone trying to use something like Skype. There is no option to pay for a better service so your pretty much stuck if you need to do some work. From time to time I was there during the day and during the day it was fast and good, so clearly an overloading problem . Ironically, I could get a very strong connection in my room from another hotel which was also free (The Inn) and it worked a lot better so used that most of the time in the evenings. 2) It wasnt a major, but when first checked in and saw it was level 3, enquired about perhaps a higher room (before i knew it would be quiet) and got a strange semi snide comment about if you book through expedia, you should expect a cheap room . Sort of second class citizen thing, which was weird, in my case it was booked for me, so I had no idea what we paid so was a little miffed and not a great way to start. In the end no matter, but perhaps keep it in mind if you book this way.

The location could not be beat. My husband and I were both born in San Francisco and he has lived there on and off much of our lives. This hotel reminded me of the old Victorian we lived in on Haight Street. The hotel is housed in a wonderfully old building that is loaded with charm. The lobby's ceilings have that beautiful detail found in Victorians; the rooms have high ceilings with exposed fire deterrent piping; the bathrooms have large old tubs; absolutely homey. I felt as if I was in my sister-in-law's guest suite in the old farmhouse that her and her husband restored. I loved it! As other reviewers have mentioned, the room and bathroom were on the small side. My husband is 6'4\" and about 220 and he had to adjust to the small toilet. However, the room has everything you need or could want. The soap, lotion, shampoo and conditioner were of good quality. The rubber ducky was a fun treat as was the jar of mints and other goodies. The staff was extremely helpful. We had dinner reservations and needed a taxi. The valet/bell staff literally spent at least 40 minutes out in the rain trying to hail a cab. The hotel bar was a fun hotspot for happy hour. The room service was prompt and delicious. Also, please remember that this hotel is located in downtown San Francisco. With the windows open in the room, you will hear the sounds of the city. However, we had a room facing Powell Street and with the windows closed, you could not hear a thing! This also means that you likely pay for parking. We used the valet service and had no problems.

Great location, in the heart of everything and right outside the cable car stop. Personal and friendly hotel, rather than a big chains, I can not fault any of the staff, Alisha behind the bar was amazing, giving us local recomendations of restaurants and bars, a wealth of knowledge of local places rather than touristy ones. She also helped us source some wines they sell from a local off licence, even calling ahead to ensure they had them in stock. She was fantastic!! So much so that on our last night we enjoyed her company so much we did not even make it to dinner!! Bell Boys also great, giving us more advice and help. Rooms were great, ample room for us, but I know that in the US you probably may think them a little small, bathrooms a little tired but quite possibly the best shower I have ever had. Little touches in the hotel, make this stick out....umbrella in room, sweets in room, pillow menu and the tea and coffee was great to get you going in the morning. Be sure to pick up all the local maps, they have great discount vouchers on the back, including the one behind the bell boys desk has a 2 for 1 wine tasting voucher at the wine collective at Fishermans wharf. A great escape from the rain for a few hours!! All in all a fantastic hotel that I would not hesitate to recomend to anyone, thank you to all at the Chancellor to making our trip to San Fran amazing!!

I would absolutely tell anyone looking for a hotel in San Francisco to carefully research the area and the specific hotel.

Book first, and ask questions later (seriously). Just to clarify, I got this room for a fantastic rate ($75 on Expedia.ca), so my review is coming from the perspective of someone who paid a very decent price for this hotel. PROS: +Awesome location: Everyone mentions this in their review, but I'd just like to reiterate what an amazing location the Chancellor is located in. Close to EVERYTHING, including Union Square, cable cars, food, shopping etc. You seriously can't do any better than this when it comes to staying in SF (Fisherman's Wharf is only about 10-15 mins away on the cable car) +Very, very clean: The housekeeping staff does a great job cleaning your room, and overall the room was very well maintained. (although the bathroom could use a slight refresh; no biggie though) The housekeeping/maintenance staff are also EXCEPTIONALLY nice. Can't say enough good things about them. Very polite, asked me how my day was etc., and were SUPER fast when I had a few things that I needed (phone wasn't working, requested a fridge and white noise machine) +The Pillow Menu: The Chancellor offers a \"pillow menu\" which has at least 8-10 different pillow types you can request - including pillows I had never even seen or heard of before. Definitely worth trying out if you're staying for a few days or longer +Not noisy (really!): A few reviews mentioned that the rooms tended to get a bit noisy at night time with all the traffic and all that. I slept with the windows open, and my room was facing Powell Street - and I slept like a baby (although maybe my 18+ hour sightseeing days kind of exhausted me as well!). A little tip: the hotel has some white noise machines which really help, so don't hesitate to request one of those. +Other pluses: A few things which I found useful: 1) There isn't really a gym in the hotel, but they do have an agreement of some sort with a full-sized gym (\"Club One Health Club\" if you want to Google it). It's literally a 5 minute walk away from the hotel (Mason & Sutter), and it has everything you'd need. I think it's a great idea, since most hotel \"gyms\" usually consist of 2 treadmills and a few free weights. This gym was great, and the staff there is nice too (tip: take your hotel card & one piece of ID with you...lockers w/ locks are provided) 2) Safe is included, as well a heater (not really sure when you'd need that in San Fran!) Oh, and including an umbrella in the closet was also a nice touch. 3) Mini-fridges aren't really included in the room, but you can request one without any problem 4) Great channel selection on TV: Didn't watch much of it, but they had all the useful channels (at least to me), including CNBC, CNN, ESPN and all the other good stuff. 5) Tour desk is staffed with a great lady (sorry, forgot her name!), but you can book everything through her (or at least get some info) - and muni passes are available from her (DEFINITELY get the muni pass if you're staying for longer than a day or two) 6) Can't forget the almost-famous rubber ducky in the bathroom ;) DEBATABLE: +/- Room temp: I went during January, and the weather was picture perfect (22-24 degrees Celsius, sunny all day). However, I DID notice the room was slightly warm during the afternoons when I came back to change clothes or something. There is a ceiling fan which helps, and you can open the window all the way. But honestly, I don't know how bearable the room would be in the heat of the summer. The hotel DOES NOT have A/C. Not really a big deal, but if you're going in the summer and absolutely NEED the A/C, then you may need to think twice. CONS: -Wi-fi Internet: Wasn't AWFUL, but it wasn't very speedy during many times. For some odd reason, the best wi-fi reception I got was in the bathroom (don't ask me how I know this :P) -Front desk staff: The staff is \"pleasant\", but honestly I did not find them particularly engaging. There was one particular woman at the front desk in the afternoon who was pretty stiff. I asked her how to get to the gym, and she rolled her eyes at me like I was bothering her or something. And when I got to the gym, the guy at the front desk said that guests need to bring a piece of ID with them - something the lady at the front desk didn't mention (luckily the staff at the gym are very nice, so I was able to slip through). Another gentleman at the desk, who I think is the supervisor/manager (young-ish looking guy) also didn't really seem to go out of his way to engage with people at the front desk. Not really a big deal, but kind of blemished the otherwise great hotel OVERALL: The hotel definitely made my stay in San Fran (which is an awesome city, btw) a bit more memorable and tension-free overall. Apart from the few slightly negative \"cons\", I wouldn't ever hesitate to give this hotel a second chance or to recommend it to someone else. I just hope the front desk staff can be a bit more consistent in their customer service so they don't tarnish the reputation of this otherwise amazing hotel.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and Price\u201d", "Author": "timmytichi", "ReviewID": "UR96073243", "Content": "this was a hidden gem.

The bathroom was quite old and small but clean and functional. There was a huge walk-in wardrobe which allowed us to get our luggage out of the way. The beds were comfortable and there's even a pillow menu. My only concern about the room is that there is no air-conditioning which for us travelling in winter wasn't really a problem. However, we couldn't sleep with the window open due to the degree of street noise and we slept with the fan on even in December to get enough cool air circulating in to sleep comfortably.

There is a place right in the lobby of the hotel that you can buy a MUNI passport at, and you can also get an airport shuttle there for just a few dollars more than the BART, and it is a much more comfortable and convenient ride. 3. The young lady at the front desk printed out our boarding passes for us - and she was happy to do so! 4. The cute yellow duckie in the bathroom was too cute! And the bath salts and deep bath tub were a plus - they helped soothe my aching calf muscles after walking up hills in Pacific Heights lol. 5. The food at Lucques was delicious! Everything was very fresh and cooked to perfection. I recommend the breakfast burrito - YUM! 6. We were greeted EVERY day by someone whenever we came and went from the lobby- we felt like royalty. 7.

I corresponded a little with Wes Tyler, the Chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manager, after we made our reservation. He was extremely pleasant and, when we arrived, our room was exactly as we requested. We had a room on the front of the 13th floor; we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize until the 3rd day that the window was slightly open, but we had no trouble with noise before that and no trouble with temperature after closing it. The ceiling fan was more than sufficient for cooling (and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m extremely sensitive to heat when sleeping). One caveat: because of the size of the bathroom and the placement of the toilet, larger persons might have difficulty getting comfortable on it.

In addition, since this is in the news quite a bit at the moment, I am happy to report that there are NO BEDBUGS! A sign in the room asks that tips for the housekeeping staff not be left in the rooms; however, tips are welcome (and deserved), but the front desk will provide an envelope for your tip at checkout if you ask for it.

We requested a quiet room and were put on the 14th floor in the front of the building. The room was quite small but cozy. The bed was queen sized and for the most part comfortable. My husband did not sleep as well as I did, but he is picky when it comes to beds so I can't fault the hotel. Thankfully the room had a ceiling fan because the room did get a little warm. We slept with one window open and the ceiling fan on which worked well at night. They also offer additional fans if needed. Even though we were on one of the highest floors we could hear traffic noise and trolleys (drawback of being in the middle of Union Square) and although this did not interfere with our sleep it might be a problem for light sleepers. I would recommend for those who need absolute peace and quiet to request a room on the back side of the hotel.The room was tastefully furnished with a decent sized flat screen TV, a small desk, small coffee table with chairs and two night stands. The bathroom although small was adequate. I did feel that it could have used a bit more counter space. There was plenty of hot water with good water pressure. The following is just a minor issue but my husband usually uses the body wash and shampoo supplied by the hotel rather than packing his however we both found that the body wash supplied had an very unpleasant scent so he wound up using mine. We were happy to see that there was a safe supplied in the large closet. They did have an iron and ironing board however my husband found that the iron was a bit old and did not work very well. Although breakfast is not included there is a restaurant in the hotel where we would have breakfast for reasonable prices. The hotel can't be more conveniently located. We come from New York City and I am positive that for the price, location and condition of the room and hotel that it is a great bargain! The location of the Chancellor in SF would be equivalent to being around Herald Square or Times Square in NYC however, in NYC one would never be able to find a hotel that is as clean and comfortable for the price and location without it being a roach motel.

As we were flying domestically (and we're from the UK) the Hotel also stored our main luggage for us so we could pack carry on bags for the internal flights (Thus saving us around $120 we would have paid by checking luggage into the hold). We asked for the quieter rooms at the back and we were given these on all 4 occasions. There is very little difference between the rooms. The rooms are a good size and include a desk and chair and also 2 other chairs and a table so not as small as you would imagine reading some other reviews!

I think that house keeping could perhaps take a bit more time to ensure this wasn't visible. - Small rooms", "Date": "September 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sussex", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel in great location - loved SF!\u201d", "Author": "Anderida", "ReviewID": "UR81086848", "Content": "We used this hotel as our first base in SF to San Diego road trip.

Perfect location - hotel not luxurious - in fact a little tired - but staff were friendly and we are very comfortable. We asked for a quiet room - we are very light sleepers. Room initally allocated was on the 2nd floor at the rear but dark and quite noisy due to aircon units on neighbouring buildings. Were moved to a much lighter room on 9th floor by very helpful and understanding receptionist. Still some aircon noise but would be fine for most \"normal\" sleepers! Would consider hotel nexttime and would recommend. We didn't eat at the hotel but ate for 3 nights in Scala's just across the road which was excellent (do book first if pos)! NB booked car thru Alamo via Trailfinders for our departure day - they are very handily located for Union Sq (there are other hire firms nearby) and despite the perceived nightmare of driving in central SF it was very simple to get out of town heading south (towards Monterey) using their directions and satnav/GPS which would highly recommend (about \u00c2\u00a320).

The valet parking was easy and convenient and well worth the cost. $29 I believe. Allow 30 mins. for your car to be brought around. Well worth the value and convenience, since SF is a terrible parking city. The cleanliness of the room was exceptional each day. I can't say enough about this. The linens and douvet are very nice and the pillows are extremely comfortable. I cannot say enough about what an outstanding hotel the Chancellor is.

When I needed some leftovers reheated for dinner, the bellboy took my food back to the kitchen and returned it to me on a tray complete with linen napkin, silverware, glass of ice water, and a fresh-baked chocolate chip cookie on the side.

And there were flasks of complimentary coffee available on the ground floor near the bar area, with cookies and popcorn also.

The first evening we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really eat much as it was around 3-4 am in the morning on our UK time, so we felt a bit spaced out.

There is a computer (behind the front desk-off to the side) guests can use, and there is about a 20 minute time limit, if someone else is waiting. There is also another small desk/concierge area, that also sells common items and snacks etc. The parking garage is located nearby, and whenever we wanted our car, it was there in front within 5 minutes. We only got it out twice during our 5 night stay. Location-simply cannot be beat. Right in Union Square, across the street from a small park, and the major shopping venues like Macy's. There is a Walgreen's 2 doors down for any items you may need. Several restaurants within a short distance. Public transport is either right there at the front of the hotel, across the street or down a block or two or three. The hotel is on a slight hill. The restaurant located in the hotel is excellent. Small. Very friendly, professional waitstaff. Very clean. The food was excellent. We were full and didn't need to eat lunch at all. Nice decor. Our room: we were on the 15th floor, which I had requested. It was very quiet, we NEVER heard anyone in the hotel close a door, walk by our room, nothing. The rooms are small. But the huge walk in closet more than makes up for it. We had a queen bed, which was comfortable. The linens are very decent. We asked for and got our extra pillows. They have a menu of like 15 different kinds of pillows. 2 nightstands, each with its own lamp. Alarm clock/radio. One drawer in each nightstand, as well as an open area under. Ceiling fan. Two chairs, and though they are OK, not the kind you are going to stretch out in and be comfortable for any length of time. A table between them with a silver tray with a dish of candy (peppermints, etc.), an ice bucket. Very nice desk with chair. A couple drawers in desk. 3 drawer dresser with TV on top. The closet: LOL. Loved it. Safe and iron/board in here. 2 luggage racks. Plenty of hangars, ask for more if needed. Extra blanket and pillow on top shelf, which extends length of closet. More than enough room to hang all your clothes (bring some of your plastic hangars from home), stash your several pieces of luggage, dirty clothes bag and still move around. I stashed all my shoes on the top of the safe, they were out of the way and off the floor. Umbrella provided. Full length mirror, I think.....! Bathroom: Deep, old cast iron soaking tub with your very own yellow rubber ducky. You can take this home, they want you too. :) Good water pressure, several different types of flow. One sink, large mirror, small shelf. Toilet. Wastpaper basket. Very nice towels. Nice bath products. Hairdryer. Everything worked well-lights, plugs, TV, remote, hairdryer, safe, alarm, locks, water pressure, iron. Like many if not most hotels in SF, this one does not have A/C. It was warm in our room most of the time, though we had the ceiling fan going all the time. We opened the window, which opens a whole 3 inches or so. Now I do not know if you are suppose to, but guessing not, we got the bolt out and were able to open the window all the way. We felt much better with the air blowing in. We also bought a small fan at Walgreen's, though I sleep with a fan on, and it was originally meant for that purpose, but had it going all the time, also. Though we heard all the city noises with the open window, we didn't mind. We closed it when we went to sleep and when we were gone, of course. You can still hear sirens, loud yelling from the street, whistles, and maybe the Cable Car clanging, but it never bothered us and I am a very light sleeper. We loved our view of Macy's and the park. Checkout was just as quick and friendly. The concierge is nice and helpful, though we got some short answers from her. We chose a different tour company than she suggested and she didn't say one word about them. I was left stammering some sentence, I felt like I had to appease her. But I just thanked her and walked away. We took one taxi, and they had it arrive in 5 minutes. We never used the evening bar area. We did get coffee though, and it was OK. They also had hot chocolate if I remember correctly and it was very good. Very happy with our stay, and with the price paid.

The fact that the rooms were adjoining ment we could circulate between them without having to go out in to the hallway though. The Hotel provided a rollaway bed for one of our sons which made their room a bit of a squeeze and we were told that they were phasing them out but it meant not having to pay for a third room for the 5 of us. We found the staff very pleasant and helpful and the reception area had nice settees with a large bowl of fruit and a breakfast bar beyond which we did not use. We had picked up a hire car from the airport and used the multistory car park in Sutter Street which the Hotel has an overnight arrangement with. Be careful though, the car park is a little difficult to find and we heard one couple complain that they had used the wrong park and had been charged the full overnight rate. The proximity to the Powell and Mason Line enabled us to see most of the city very easily using the day pass which I think was about $20.

If you stay here, and you certainly should, just ask for a room on the back side of the building, away from the street. Aside from that, our only complaint was the size of the rooms - since its just two of us, and didn't spend a lot of time in the room, it was just fine. The bathrooms are VERY small though - the kind where you almost have to stand in the shower to shut the door, because the toilet is in the way. Again - just fine for us. And we're average sized people. But they're definitely smaller than average (its a historic property). Room was terribly comfortable though - and their pillow menu was really cool. We sampled two, and I may even buy myself a buckwheat pillow now. I slept like a baby. Very comfortable bed as well (including the standard pillows). They had lovely relaxing bath salts along with the standard shampoos, etc. SPECIAL TOUCHES: The front desk staff routinely gave us easy bus directions and great maps to help us out. We also arrived on our anniversary, and the hotel left a bottle of sparkling wine (Napa) and some truffles in our room. The cable cars stop DIRECTLY in front of the hotel, and the F-Tram line is a few blocks down the street. We used the city bus system mostly, and several lines stop within a block or two. Its location on Union Square makes it an easy crossroads for transportation and shopping is great. Several restaurants in the area as well. We didn't eat the hotel restaurant though, so can't include that in the review. Hint - there's a Borders a few doors down, and they have hot breakfast sandwiches and lovely pastries with their Seattle's Best coffee, for much less money than the local restaurants.

Always nice to get off to a good start. CHECK IN - smooth and efficient and we were allocated a room on a high floor as requested. Reception staff were very helpful and very happy to offer directions when asked. The only irritation was with the tour booth lady who jumped on us before we could get to the lift and thrust leaflets in my hand trying to sell tours/bus passes etc. I told her we'd take a look, but had already booked a couple of tours online to which she made a face and promptly grabbed them back. Quite amusing really, but it did put us off approaching her again for a couple of days, although I must add that when we did she very efficiently arranged our transfer back to the airport. ROOM - our room was very well furnished, spotlessly clean the whole visit and the jar of sweets was a nice touch. As mentioned in many previous reviews they're not huge, but considering the extremely reasonable cost not really a problem. We were only staying for 4 nights so didn't want to fully unpack and therefore found it quite difficult to fit both cases in, but again a minor problem which we managed to get round. The bathroom was very small and did feel a bit cramped, but again spotlessly clean and for a short stay quite adequate. FOOD - we only ate in the hotel restaurant for breakfast on our third day as we were usually out early for tours. The food was very well cooked and reasonably priced, but the waiter although very efficient wasn't particular friendly - just going through the motions would be the best description. LOCATION - very central with easy access to the cable cars. Particularly good if you like to shop - not really our thing so no reflection on the hotel, but we would probably opt to stay on the Embarcadero if we visit again. OVERALL - we very much appreciated the complimentary coffee and cookies in reception, especially when going off at silly o'clock for the tours. Also the free WiFi in our room.

There is a closet big enough to haul 2 luggages in there, with room left for walking space or even setting up an ironing board. Location wise : just 1/2 block away from Union Square, and 2 blocks down from Market Street. This makes the location very centralized yet not overly crowded and noisy. Borders is just next door, and 24-hour pharmacy Wal-greens is just round the corner. If you are taking the BART, it will be a slight up-slope walk from the station to the hotel, but a rather leisure one.

Not only did they squeeze us in but when we arrived they had managed to juggle things so that we had the same room for our entire stay. We even got a small discount! As we had requested upon booking we were put on a high floor (luckily the top) and had cracking views over Union Square. The room itself although slightly on the small size fitted us and all our rubbish in comfortably. Nice tall ceilings and quality furishings welcomed these weary travellers. Thoughtful little touches such as the personalised rubber duck and the jar of sweets made you feel that the staff genuinely were pushing the boat out to make your stay special. Another plus that we hadn't yet encountered on our trip was the kiosk in the reception where we were able to seek help on all things SF and touristy!

The room was a bit on the small side, but comfortable enough for the little amount of time we actually spent there. The bed was so comfortable, and they have a pillow menu. That's right. A whole list of specialty pillows to choose from for your stay. I went for the magnetic therapy pillow, but there was also memory foam, body pillows, buckwheat pillows, down, etc. Pretty neat amenity. Our only complaint about our stay at the Chancellor was the pushy woman in the lobby selling Muni passes. A word to the first-time vistor: the Muni pass she's peddling will NOT work on BART or Golden Gate transport. We were told that it would work on \"any\" bus, train, cable car, etc. Not being from the area, we of course didn't realize Muni was separate of BART or Golden Gate. Also, she delayed us from getting up to our room by pushing herself into the elevator to pretty much attack new guests with her sales pitch, keeping the door held until she was done.

The plus sign is that you are able to get free wi-fi which is easily accessible in your room should you need it.

The location is excellent - cable car exactly opposite the hotel, and not only that but you are about 30 seconds away from union square so if you are a tourist you can easily catch any of the hop on hop off bus tours, which for anyone staying in the city for a week or more may find it useful to know that for about 40 dollars you can go uptown or to fisher mans wharf over and over again. The main benefit of this is that you won't need to waste money on taxis. The tour guide gave us a whole week of travel and we literally covered the city centre,north beach, china town, fishermans wharf, golden gate bridge, sausilito, golden gate park and more for two people. Basic advice? Ask for a bargain and you will get one. Hotel room was excellent. Emailed manager to ask for room high up and it was provided. Don't know why some reviews say the room was so small. Our room had a queen size bed, large tv, walk in wardrobe, drawers, two chairs and a table, as well as a full en suite bathroom. We got all of that at a bargain rate of just over 110 dollars plus tax per night. I don't know anywhere you can get that much for so little. Hotel is so clean. Annie and Maria cleaned our room to a very high standard and the entire hotel is immaculate so it gets a ten out of ten for that. Breakfast was fairly good with excellent service every day and again all food served quickly and everything was very, very clean. Susan on the tour desk / gift shop was very helpful and efficient and the front desk staff were good too. Free coffee and cookies as well as newspapers available in lobby every day, Susan always willing to assist with everything and this is a hotel I would most definitely be staying in again. Susan arranged bike tours as well as airport transfers for us so again worth her weight in gold. Bad points - nothing for the price. Not one bad remark I can say about this great little hotel to be honest. Suggestions - might be nice if coffee was available in the room - that's the only suggestion but it's not the end of the world as it is provided, but it's the only thing I felt would be a convenience. Other than that? This is a brilliant hotel and yes it's not the ritz but if you want clean, stylish with good service, a central location and something above and beyond a soul less travel lodge this is the best hotel of it's kind in San Francisco.

I was able to walk to Fisherman's Wharf, AT&T Park, the Ferry Building, and got the bus to the Golden Gate Bridge. The rooms are small as advertised, but if you've ever stayed at a not-outrageously-priced hotel in New York or Europe, you'll be amazed by the comparative opulence of the Chancellor. There is certainly room to walk around between the bed and the wall. My sister joined me for a couple of days, and there was plenty of room for two of us. I didn't miss having air conditioning, as I always wake up with a sore throat when I sleep in a room with AC on. The ceiling fan and having the window open a bit made the room plenty comfortable. It was cool at night in April anyway. I knew about the free chocolate chip cookies, apples and coffee/tea in the lobby 24/7, but having the clock radio with an MP3 player attachment so I could listen to my own tunes earphone-free was a great surprise. I enjoyed having a big flat-screen tv and the large walk-in closet too. My laptop fit perfectly in the room safe. The hotel restaurant was amazing. I ate breakfast there every day, for free because of the dining credit, and everything I had was great. The different varieties of Eggs Benedict are all fabulous, and the Greek yogurt was the best I've ever had. I'd love to know what brand it was. I even had dinner there one night, and it was actually one of the best meals of the trip. The day I walked across the Golden Gate Bridge, they also packed me a sandwich to go. The only glitch was that somehow another guest's breakfast wound up on my room charge, but when I reported it to them, they researched it and responded immediately. Because of my business/personal trip split, there were some minor issues with which card they credited, but everything worked out pretty promptly and politely. If the Chancellor could somehow be cloned and put in every place around the world I hope to visit someday, I would be one happy traveller. I would only hesitate to recommend the hotel to someone elderly, only because the extra-deep tub requires you to lift your leg kind of high to clear it when you're getting in and out of the shower. I didn't have a problem, but I'd be worried about someone prone to falling. Helpful hint: I used Google Transit to figure out where to catch public transportation, which all worked great. I found that if the stop was listed as the corner of Street A & Street B, instead of being exactly at the corner of A & B, you had to cross Street B, and the stop was actually about 20-25 feet further on Street A.", "Date": "April 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel\u201d", "Author": "manyhappydays", "ReviewID": "UR61953903", "Content": "I would highly reccommend the Chancellor Hotel on Union Square to anyone visiting San Francisco.

If you like to run laps around your room, this is not the hotel for you. The building itself is old. The elevators are old and slow, but the Chancellor provides the sort of mix of modernity and timeless elegance that really appeals to me. The furniture in our room was new and modern, but maintained the aesthetic of a European boutique hotel. The mattress and linens were top-of-the-line. I always travel with my own pillow, but the pillows were so nice that I was tempted to sneak one of them into my pillowcase, on the way out. There was even a request sheet for specialty pillows (i.e. a body pillow or between-the-knees pillow). We didn't need any, but I wish we had tried them anyway. The bathroom was tiny and a bit older looking, but very clean and functional. Only one person will fit in there at a time and there isn't a huge counter to pile your toiletries on. Again, if you and your companion need a lot of space, or you're not fond of pedestal sinks, look elsewhere. High-end toiletries are provided and the rubber duck was a thoughtful touch. The location is very central. I would NOT recommend driving around San Francisco, but you can travel just about anywhere from Union Square, by Muni. We picked up a 3-day pass for $20 and it took us everywhere we needed to go. The Caltrain station to San Jose (where we went for a hockey game) was a 10-minute ride away. On a nice day, you can walk to a number of spots, if you're willing to dedicate a few hours to meandering around. One thing of note about Union Square is that it is in the downtown core. There were homeless people roaming around the neighborhood and one perched directly outside the hotel door, on one occasion, but I did not feel unsafe at any time. No in-room coffeemakers were provided, but complimentary self-serve coffee and tea were available in the lobby. Valet parking is offered by a third-party company, for a reasonable fee (given the location). If you need your car for any reason, you must provide 20-30 minutes advance notice so the hotel can contact the valet company. Keep this in mind, if you're on a tight schedule when checking out, or if you're the sort of person who accidentally leaves things in your car, like we did. Two things prevented my stay at the Chancellor from being 100% perfect. Firstly, the Wifi was terrible. We planned on going online to look up addresses and transit schedules, but it was often too slow to be functional. On the bright side, it was complimentary, so at least we weren't paying extra to be frustrated. We were also on the very top floor. Depending on the location of the hub, I wouldn't be surprised if the connection would have been better elsewhere in the hotel. There also wasn't a fridge in the room. Fortunately, we were traveling with a cooler and there was an ice machine nearby. If you enjoy having snacks in your room, this is something to note. All in all, I thought the value was fabulous, for the area and the quality of the accommodations.

We decided on the Chancellor hotel based heavily on T.A. reviews. I booked through expedia.com.au . Our group consisted of six young adults. The accomodation more than met our requirements. Each room had enough wardrobe space for our belongings and the bathroom facilities were adequate. The bedding and pillows were comfortable (you can order special pillows at no extra cost, check the hotel guide in your room). The bar on the ground floor is very convenient if you want to throw back a couple of martinees before heading out for the evening, even better during happy hour! The guest lift is small, just like you would find in some traditional hotels in Europe. If you plan to stay at the Chancellor and you have many large bags you might need to make a few extra trips up the lift or if you're lazy just ask the front desk fro help. Each room had ceiling fans but no air con. We were there towards the end of the North American winter so air con was not required, but this could prove to be an issue in the hot summer months. You can open the window which I think is a real plus, not just for the fresh cool air but I thougth it was nice to stick my head out the window for a look or have the window open to listen to the hustle and bustle of Union Square. Location is great, if you havent' been to San Fran before do your research and look up Union Square, you'll find that it's a real central location, great for shopping! As suggested by the Hotel we booked GO Laurie's Shuttle for transport to and from the airport. It worked out around AU$90 in total for the private van each way. Susan at the tour desk in the lobby was fantastic, nothing was an issue for her, she booked everything for us with pleasure! The Chancellor Hotel ended up being a memorable part of our San Francisco experience. We were more than happy with our stay. All the employees were very friendly and accomodating at all times and the hotel itself has real character. Dont' expect a big modern fancy lobby or hi-tech lighting and electronic mod con devices in your room.. if you want that then go somewhere else.

You will notice that many( but not all ) have untreated mental illness. I learned from speaking to a reporter doing a story on this problem that many other californian cities will purchase bus tickets for their homeless to go to san fran. Once they arrive there is no help, they need to wait up to 7 years before receiving medical treatment for their illness and assistance. There are very few mental health hospitals. When they say they are hungry they probably are. I gave away lots of garanola bars, and found out what fast food places were in the area and purchased lots of 5$ gift cards and handed them out so they could at least get a sandwich. I do this anytime I travel to cities with high homeless populations. These folks are always very thankful and friendly.

Cable cars stop directly out front of the hotel and every other mode of public transport is within quick walking distance. You are also within easy walking distance for great shopping (which may or may not be a good thing). The hotel was clean, the staff were helpful, unnecessary but nice touches in the room (such as the rubber duckie, jar of lollies and biscuits) and the room size was more than adequate for two of us particularly when we were only sleeping there. Speaking of sleep - the Chancellor has the most comfortable bed and pillows. We got an amazing rate on line which included parking at a parking station just around the corner. The price could not be beat. It also included free wifi in the room. Would definately stay here again when we go back to San Francisco. If you are going to be travelling on many and varied modes of public transport throughout your stay, get a MUNI pass. They are accepted on all public transport and valid for the whole day or 3 depending on what pass you get. A cable car is $5 one way and an all day MUNI pass is $13 - you very quickly get your money's worth out of it.", "Date": "March 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ventura County", "Title": "\u201cCharming, clean and affordable.

Location wise, the Chancellor was absolutely fantastic. Just minutes away from the main shopping area and with the cable car stop right outside, we were able to get to most of the must-see destinations and do our shopping easily. Even when we needed to take the buses, it was very convenient as the bus stops were within walking distance (five minutes on average). However, do note that as the hotel has rather thin walls so you might occasionally be awakened at night if other guests return late at night and make lots of chatter in the common corridor way. We were aware of the thin walls from previous reviews so we were prepared for it. There were a few nights when other guests came in late at night and we were woken up by the chatter. There were previous reviews about the room being small but it was good enough for us. The closet room was big enough for 2 our big suitcases. There was a safe deposit box in the closet room as well. Hot coffee, teas and cookies available 24 hours at the lobby. The tea selection is quite good. For those who want to explore the city and beyond, you definitely have to speak to Susan from the Tour Desk. Susan is a GEM! She is a friendly lady who always smiles and greeted us everytime we passed by her when we headed out. She is very knowledgeable on the tours and will help you to book tours to Monterey Bay, Yosemite, Napa Valley and many others. We signed up for almost all the tours available and had a fantastic time. The customer service at Chancellor Hotel before we arrived were splendid. My gf keyed in the wrong expiry date for our credit card during reservation and Mike McConnell (reservations agent) helped to rectify it very quickly. As we were staying for more than 10 days, we requested for a high floor room with a view of Union Square. Mr. Kevin Vossen (reservations manager) was superb in answering all our enquiries via email before our arrival and did helped to arrange a high-floor room with excellent view of Union Square for us! Unfortunately, our final day stay was marred somewhat by some hiccups. We were woken up at 7:30am twice by phone calls from the front desk who mistook us as the ones who had an airport pickup at that time. We checked with the front desk after we woke up and found it strange as the guest who arranged for the pickup had a totally different surnname from ours. We were quite disappointed as the staff didn't make any apologies for their mistake. This is strange as they are in the service industry. A second hiccup followed later in the afternoon. We had earlier twice informed and confirmed with the front desk during arrival and also the day before our check-out that we will be extending our check-out time to 4pm and were well aware that we will be paying extra for the late checkout. While we were catching on our sleep (having been woken by the front desk in morning at 7:30am), we were woken up again at 2pm by the front desk telling us it's time to check out. These are just minor issues but it's good to note as guests will still review the hotel based on overall experience. Other than this, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Chancellor and will definitely recommend this place.", "Date": "February 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cdon't stay anywhere else\u201d", "Author": "bam1748", "ReviewID": "UR57031046", "Content": "Have stay in plenty of downtown hotels, the Chancellor is at the top of the list.

Initially I booked for $149 a night on the hotel website, but a couple of months out I found a better rate ($89 a night plus taxes) on Expedia, so I took that rate with a smile. I arrived at 2pm but my room was not available until 3pm, no problem - they took my bags and I went for a walk. They gave me a room on the 12th floor in the corner looking out over Union Square. It's a small room but it has a walk in closet, and its very well furbished. The bed was a little hard the first night (I have a princess and the pea back) but the next day they put a egg-crate foam topper on the bed and that made it incredibly comfy. There is the full complement of toiletries - shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soaps, plus cotton buds and tips, shower cap - and your own take-home rubber duckie. Mine came with a mobile phone and filofax! There is no mini bar but when I realised this, I asked if it was possible to have a bar fridge brought up and it was delivered within the hour. There is a Walgreens on the corner to buy milk etc - I prefer to have cereal in my PJs - can't handle company before breakfast! The room has a desk, chest of drawers with a big flat screen tv, table and chairs, and lots of lamps. Nice heavy curtains keep out the neon lights from the Square. I only realised it on day 3 but my window was open about an inch which was why it was so noisy - when pulling the curtains on the morning of day 3 I noticed curtain billowing outside and followed it back to the source; once I closed the window it was really quiet and peaceful! Nice carpet, nice soft towels and flannels etc. There is a pillow menu with 12 different types of pillows but I just stuck to the down pillows. The location could not be better; a 5 minute walk down Powell takes you to Market St, and the cable car stops just outside the hotel so you can shoot up to the tourist sites without having to queue down on Market. Get a Muni Pass if you are visiting - 3 days for $18 compared to $5 per trip on the cable car; I estimate I would have 'spent' $15 a day on local transport without the pass. Tea and coffee are available all day in the foyer, along with REALLY yummy cookies and fresh apples. There is a tour desk down there too - the woman behind the counter has a lot of zeal! They can book you on the airport shuttle for $14. The front desk staff are incredibly helpful and friendly - even with my extra demands (fridge, bed) they didn't blink - and they lent me packing tape and scissors when I decided to see how much stuff I could pack into one of those flat-rate boxes the USPS the sells ($56 to Australia, up to 20lbs - I managed to get 17.5 pounds in there!). The rooms and the foyer are all wireless - and its pretty high-speed for wireless too. Plenty of power points throughout the room and the bathroom - and the light switches are night lights which is cool because the bathroom is a step-up and the light always reminded me. There is a restaurant downstairs for breakfast and lunch, and room service is available until 9pm.

The hotel is in the heart of Union square - a busy shopping district in the centre of town. The area is also very pretty at night (around the holidays there's a massive Christmas tree lighting up the square). - Price. I booked the room for $100 per night - very low for a decent hotel in San Francisco, so excellent value for money. - Comfortable rooms. Great beds, free wi-fi in the rooms. Lovely (walk-in) closet. - Friendly and welcoming staff. Cons: - Room size: the rooms are comfortable, but small. - Slow (free) wifi. Good for surfing the web, but too slow to stream video. Tips & tricks: - Guests have complimentary access to a great health club just around the corner. Or you can just get a room on the top floor and walk up the 15 floors of stairs instead of taking a lift. :) - Delicious coffee, tea (and biscuits in the morning) are available in the lobby around the clock and free of charge. - Because of the lack of AC, the bathroom window needs to be opened regularly to avoid getting mold spots on the mirror and walls. - Room doors have standard locks, but no door chains - a first among dozens of hotels I have stayed in and should be trivial to resolve.

The hotel itself: It is a boutique hotel, which is of course a difference from a large chain such as Marriott or Hyatt, but the experience was great. The hotel staff were polite and helpful but not intrusive. A few notes about the building: it is older; less space in the staircases/elevators; no A/C in the rooms (ceiling fan present) but SF doesn't get that hot/cold during most months. Rooms are cozy, but furnishings were functional and in good condition. Inside the room: flat-screen TV, free wi-fi in the rooms and in the lobby, no coffee maker (but you can place a request), free coffee and cookies in the lobby, free access to the Club One gym a block away (no fitness center inside the hotel), well organized walk-in closet, comfortable and clean bedding, all light fixtures were in order.

We were gifted with a 2 room/2 bathroom suite on the top floor overlooking Union Square---ooooh! Last week, I e-mailed Mr. Tyler again just to ask a couple of questions; did not mention my birthday. Imagine my surprise and joy when we checked into the room and found a nice card with birthday greetings for me, and a gift certificate to the wonderful Luques restaurant in the hotel. I honestly don't believe that would have been remembered at very many, if any, other hotel anywhere. And I'm sure Mr. Tyler ordered the rain and cold just for me during our visit, just as the topping for my birthday visit. Chancellor is rated 3 stars technically, but in our book, it's a 5 star, beginning with the eager-to-please and always smiling staff. Rory, Zach, Shamina, Harris, Nate, Mike, Johnny, Alicia in the bar (who remembered us from LAST year!), Yesmie in the restaurant, the lady at the tour desk (I forgot to get her name.), the housekeepers, the maintenance people - honestly, every single person wants to be sure you're happy. The hotel is small, which adds to its appeal. You're greeted not only with a smile, but with your name. Cookies and coffee are always available in the lobby. The rooms are very nice. If you need great big suites, and huge bathrooms, go elsewhere. We're out and about a lot, and don't need a large room to sit idle during the day. If you want a beautiful room with a very comfortable bed and pillows, flat screen tv, walk-in roomy closet (not all rooms, though), very nice bathroom amenities including bath salts, come to the Chancellor. I even like the green walls and chairs! And a hot soak in that deep tub with the wonderful bath salts after walking those hills - my goodness. I now have 2 Christmas rubber duckys (duckies?) - another nice little gift touch from your bathroom, and I hope to acquire many more from future visits. Breakfast at Luques was wonderful - uncrowded, quiet, great food, great service. Try the eggs benedict, French toast, Chicken California sandwich. All were delicious. And finally, the proximity to the cable cars, bus routes, Union Square shopping, Market Street, Chinatown - just more and more reasons to make your home base the Chancellor while in San Francisco. The only negative is that we don't live closer, and can't visit more often. I am so grateful to fellow travelers who take the time to write reviews, or the 3 stars may have prevented my ever giving the Chancellor a try.

I usually prefer business hotels and tried to find another place until the last minute. However, this hotel seemed to offer best value for money and we decided to stay there. This was a good decision. Having read all the great reviews about the service in the hotel I was disappointed at first. I felt that we needed to make the initiative to get the service, i.e. ask about everything as nothing was explained in the beginning (coffee, breakfast, bar, fridge in the room..). However, as soon as we did this, it was apparent that the reviews we correct. We got very good and personal service. Everyone working at the hotel was very polite and easy to approach. The tourdesk downstairs is the best. You can book tickets, buy Muni Passes and get all tourist information you need. We stayed in the hotel on two different occasions during our visit to SF. Both times the rooms were clean and nice with good pillows, flat screen TVs, good sized closets and best of all free internet. Rooms don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have air conditioning, but this didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us at all. Open window and a ceiling fan did the job. Bathrooms were a bit on the old side, but perfectly usable (and clean). As said earlier, this is not a standard business hotel, but a hotel with character. One negative aspect was the noise from a room next door on our second stay. Our first room was very quiet but in the second one we could hear our neighbors talk and at night, snore. It felt as we were in the same room. The noise coming from the street didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us at all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was nice hearing the streetcars pass by and ring their bells. We had breakfast on four of the six mornings we stayed downstairs in the Luques Restaurant. It cost abt 35 USD (tip and tax included) for 2 and was definitely worth it. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the point in going to the restaurant next door as they pretty much had the same menu and prices. Service at the Luques was very good and friendly. Location of the hotel is perfect, right next to Union Square. In addition to the shopping and restaurants, it is an excellent place for public transportation. You can hop on the cable car to get to Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf or walk down two blocks to Market Street and hop on a tram/bus to get to Ferry Building (or if you go the other way - to Castro District).

After driving across the country from Chicago and staying in various different hotels along the way, the Chancellor Hotel felt like an old-school Hollywood hotel of which we got a great rate on. Everything was so authentic and unique throughout the entire hotel from the lobby with extremely personable staff to the room which was cute and well furnished. It looked and felt like one of the older buildings in San Francisco which added a very nice feel to the experience of our trip. However, they are very well kept with modern features like a flat screen TV in the room, high speed wireless internet and the options to choose a dozen different types of pillows! The best part of the hotel was the location. You're in the heart of San Francisco and the trolley really does stop right at the Chancellor's doorstep. Everyone was very helpful in helping out the \"out of towners\" get around and navigate the public transit system (which was fairly simple if you're familiar with riding buses and trains in a major city). Overall, I would definitely stay at the Chancellor again. We even spoke to a gentleman in the elevator who said that he's stayed across the street at a different hotel for 20 years and decided (opting for a better rate) to stay at the Chancellor this particular weekend. He said that he was happier with this stay than in the 20 years he's traveled to San Francisco. Only drawback was parking, we got a deal where our parking at the Valet Garage around the corner was included with our room rate. It's downtown San Francisco so there's not much room to park anyway. It was a small price to pay for an amazing stay in a beautiful city.

No air/con but I guess you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need it in San Francisco. When I was there it was veeery hot, but it was unusual for the city and the fan was ok anyway. I have one complain about Luke restaurant which is inside the hotel. My partner and I had $25 credit so we had breakfast there. Omelette was good, but my fried eggs tasted like pancake! I think they cooked them in the same pan where they had just cooked a pancake! I had it changed but the potatoes (terrible they were\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) had gone cold and the bacon too. The next day the special was steak\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6come on! You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have steak in the morning! I asked for pastry but they had none even if on the menu\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..so the set was yogurt (in a bowl\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.) juice and white toast\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6all for $7.50 which I find expensive\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.I also ordered fruit aside as it was not included in the set\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother eating breakfast at Luke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and go somewhere else!", "Date": "September 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Mass", "Title": "\u201cFABULOUS HOTEL AND STAFF\u201d", "Author": "chaquitaBoston_Mass", "ReviewID": "UR39802601", "Content": "I loved the Chancellor hotel in Union square.

I booked this hotel online, through the Chancellor Hotel website, and I selected a daily rate that included a food/beverage meal credit.

First of all, this hotel couldn't be in a better location! it is right on Union Square, the cable car goes right in front of this hotel. There is shopping and dining everywhere. It is very easy to get to the Fisherman's Warf etc. The room I have (9th floor) was exactly as I saw the photos on the website, right down to the paint color. I have a room with 1 double bed. I think most people consider this room to be small ONLY because it has 1 bed, and not 2 beds. I guess its kind of small, but certainly not uncomfortable. I take cruise vacations all the time (2 or 3 times per year) and this hotel room is HUGE compared to a cruise cabin! ha ha I have plenty of room here to get around, there's even a nice desk where I work at my laptop (I also LOVE that there's free WiFi here - which is one of the reasons why I selected this hotel to begin with) and a lovely sitting area with 2 chairs & a small table. I haven't heard any strange noises, am not kept up at night and I wouldn't even know that there were other people on my floor unless I saw them on the elevator. I got great service at the front desk. I think the breakfast food in the Lougues restaurant is great, although the first day I ate there the service was VERY SLOW but that's only because it was busy. The lobby lounge is only open 5pm to 930pm, which isn't very long opening hours, but I managed to find a nice lounge close by to enjoy after dinner drinks with friends.

The hotel did not have many rooms per floor and felt a little claustrophobic. I did appreciate the art deco-influenced styling.

Disadvantages The main problem for my husband and I was the noise. Directly outside of our window (3rd floor) was an air-conditioning/water unit for an adjacent building. I have attached a photo. The noise was really loud. My husband and I have backpacked around the world and both of us can sleep anywhere - but we really struggled to get any sleep at the Chancellor. No-one should have to put up with this kind of noise in a hotel. Obviously in a city you expect street noise - but not industrial noise non-stop almost 24hrs a day. No air conditioning. In San Francisco this should not be a problem. The weather was COLD when we were there - but the room was HOT HOT HOT. And we couldn't open the window as this made the noise from the industrial unit even worse. No fridge in room. I asked when I checked in if it was possible to have a fridge in my room. I was told it was possible for a fridge to be moved- but no fridge arrived. I did not ask for a fridge again as once we arrived at our room it was so small we could not see where the fridge could possibly fit - together with our bags. However it would have been good service to get an explanation as to why we did not get the fridge we had asked for. Bathroom. The bathrooms are TINY- very little room for washbags. Also the state of the tiles in our bathroom was terrible. I have added a couple of photos. The bathroom in our room was certainly in need of freshening up. Food. We only had 1 meal at the hotel - we had breakfast from room service but this was enough to put us off. I had homemade granola and rye bread toast and both were disgusting. First of all the granola contained loads of pine nuts. Now I love pine nuts - but in savoury dishes - it is just wrong eating them for breakfast. Also the rye bread was unlike any rye bread I have ever seen or tasted. It was basically white bread with a very strongly tasted herb. I think this may have been cumin - it was certainly not rye - and again it was totally unsuitable for breakfast. Advantages Great location Main bedroom was clean Comfortable bed Fantastic Italian restuarant across the road Handy for the tram Parking I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who likes to sleep (due to the noise).

My wife and mother-in-law tagged along to do some sightseeing. Being from rural Pennsylvania, we weren't quite sure what to expect, but we were pleasantly surprised by every aspect of this hotel. Rooms: The rooms are tastefully decorated and cozy. The bathrooms weren't as small as I expected. The flat screen TV was very nice and there was a small desk for me to set up my laptop. Our room was very clean. It was also very quiet considering that the hotel is in the heart of the city, the cable car runs right in front of the building and we had our windows open the whole stay. When we checked in, I asked for a quiet room and the staff delivered. Our room was on the 15th floor and at the back of the building. I do have to remind readers that this hotel doesn't have AC. We didn't need it since the high temperatures each day never got past the low 70s. However, if you're one of those people that has to have AC, this isn't the hotel for you. Service: Everyone was very friendly and helpful, from the bell staff to the cleaning service. We arrived in the city early and our room wasn't ready, so we left our luggage with the bellman. Once our room was available, the person at the front desk said that they would bring our luggage up. I figured we would see it in about a half an hour, but to my surprise the luggage was brought up about two minutes after we stepped into our room. The cleaning person on our floor was also very friendly. We opted not to have our room cleaned every day, but whenever she saw us, she asked if we needed any additional towels or toiletries. Finally, I'd like to mention Susan at the Tourist Desk. She's one of the hotel's stars as far as we're concerned. She booked tours for us, gave directions, helped us with transportation and was just a wonderful, friendly person who always said hello when we walked past and asked us how our day was going. She helped make our trip enjoyable, since part of the fun of travelling is meeting new people. Value: Considering the location, the room rates were quite reasonable.

The entire place is non smoking, which is a plus for us, the room was very nicely decorated, clean, had nice touches like the flat screen TV and the little jar of candies that awaited us when we got there. The beds were comfortable and everything was just perfect. The only thing I would mention that maybe some people should consider is that rooms that face Powell st. might be a little noisy due to the cable car passing by, and also, don't expect a huge room, the rooms are cozy. But again - we loved the room so non of the above applied to us. Other great things besides the room - complimentary coffee, cookies and newspapers in the lobby made our day each day, and since we travelled sans laptop - the free internet in the lobby worked well for us. Can't write a review without mentioning the great location - lots of good restaurants around, shops, attractions, easy access by public transportation to all parts of the city nearby. The hotel staff are so helpful, useful, smiling people we just enjoyed approaching whenever we needed something. I'm sorry I don't remember the name of the specific receptionist who assisted us, but they were all equally nice.

The hotel was a short walk to great shopping and a quick Muni ride to my son's apartment. We were pretty centrally located for just about everything.

No complaints and we would never hesitate to stay here again. I'd recommend it to everyone. The staff was very nice and very helpful. For me, the free coffee and cookies were the best part- I drink a lot of coffee, so it was great to grab a cup in the mornings, or when we got back after a long day. It was good coffee, and the cookies were so yummy! We didn't eat in the restaurant, but we were under-whelmed with the breakfast we ordered from room service. The bar makes great drinks though! And the woman at the little shop was a wealth of knowledge. Our room was on the 13th floor and very quiet, and the ceiling fan was more than enough to keep us cool. The bed was comfy and the room was spotless. The bathrooms are small and older, but clean and simple, and the bathtub is huge. They offer a pillow menu, which is a nice touch, and so was the flat screen tv. The rooms are also on the small side, but we didn't have a problem. They are decorated nicely, very modern, and we had plenty of room for the 2 of us. The location can't be beat- right in the heart of Union Square. Sears Diner is right next door, and I recommend the Daily Grill for a nice meal, which is one block down on Geary. The shopping in Union Square is amazing too! The cable cars stop right at the hotel, and the walk from the BART station to the hotel is quick and easy. Definitely take the BART from the airport, its the cheapest and easiest way to go.

From the reservation process right through to checking out, everything was just perfect. The Chancellor, in my opinion, excel at every turn. Above and beyond the physical aspects of this fine hotel, the service the staff offer is the best we have ever seen. Why? - because they genuinely care about their guests. Nothing else is more apparent. Now to the basics - I'll follow the TripAdvisor criteria in order: 1) Cleanliness Room and all public areas absolutely spotless. So fresh and clean and well looked after. We stayed a number of nights, and the standards never slipped once. Perfect. 2) Location The best location in the city. Right on Union Square, right by the cable cars, right by the best of everything in the city. We have been to San Francisco a number of times and would never stay anywhere else. As a tourist in the city, the two main neighborhoods you tend to consider are Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf. In my opinion, Union Square wins hands down. The Wharf is a bit too tacky, a bit too touristy, and in general, a bit overpriced (restaurant wise). And it tends to die a death at night. Eerily quiet. Union Square has great places for breakfast (World Famous Sears is right next door, Lori's on corner of next block), and loads to do at night (very near cinema's, theatre district (Wicked recommended). During the day, go shopping crazy. Borders Bookstore is right next door as well - and is open seven days, never closing before 11pm - a nice little excursion in the evening. And Walgreen's is on the same block as the hotel - for all your snacking and pharmacy needs... 3) Rooms Beautiful room. We stayed in 905, and would recommend it to anyone. Side view over Union Square, nice modern decor, flat screen tv, perfect bathroom with lovely big bathtub. Dreamy bed. Great storage space. Lovely desk. Awesome extras in room such as umbrella and iron/ironing board (neither of which you get at the Westin next door!). Safe, WiFi internet etc etc etc. Perfect! 4) Service Above everything else - this is what will stick with me. The staff is friendly, polite, professional, and - like i said before - they care! Other little service touches such as the rubber duck in the bathroom and the awesome pillow menu, all add up to a memorable, unique hotel experience. 5) Value Best value I've ever encountered in a fairly pricey city. Dollar for dollar you will not get any better. Even the parking charges (garage just round the corner) were good. I highlight this as SF is normally a nightmare for parking! When I think about it, I'm amazed - We were sitting in a gorgeous hotel in the heart of the city, looking out over the wonderful Union Square, and enjoying the first class service provided by the Chancellor staff. If I could have shouted over to a guest in the neighboring Westin St.Francis, and asked them what they were paying, I'm sure it wouldn't have been $85 a night... (we payed between $85 and $125 per night in April. Incredible value - and I'm Scottish!!! (yes, we're renowned for being a little too careful with our money...) Other Chancellor stuff... free cookies at reception! - nice touch. The legendary Susan at the bookings desk who got us a car when there didn't appear to be a spare one in the whole of the city, complementary newspapers, lovely bar and restaurant with quality food!, the wonderful surprise in our room for our special occasion!, Barbary Coast nights on Fri and Sat.....oh and so much more............ A very big thank you to everyone at the Chancellor. You all made our stay in San Francisco the best ever, and we can't wait to come back and enjoy your hospitality again in the future.

Union Square is the place to be if you want to be central. Tram stop right outside the door! Staff were very friendly and helpful. I would say that Susan (works on the tour desk in the hotel reception) may come across abrupt, but she is a lovely lady and will get you pretty much anything you need. You can book all your tours through her and she will call the relevant companies while you wait to make sure that you are confirmed. The tour desk doesn't open til after 9am but is open well into the evening (I think as late as 9pm). The room we had wasn't as small as we were expecting. Very clean, nice decor and a VERY comfortable bed and great pillows. They even have a pillow menu and you can choose from a number of options but we thought the standard ones were perfect! Free tea and coffee with cookies in the hotel reception too and free internet access!

Want to see the Wharf--challenge yourself up Powell and then it is all downhill to the wharf-- then take a right(all flat) and run the piers to return via Market--about 5 miles. Early morning is best, you have the city to yourself! As for the Chancellor--quiet, clean and terribly friendly. I requested late check out and was surprised by the generous time allotted. My room was cleaned one day by Lina--oh my, she is a tidy one--so thorough! The room was more than manageable--the bathroom brought back memories of an apartment I used to occupy built during the same time --very quaint!

My wife and I stayed at the Chancellor on holiday in April 2009. We generally agree w/ the reviews we read. The location is perfect and the value was great. For a three day stay midweek WITH parking, the rate was $106/day. Similar hotels (or, perhaps better according to the rating guides) were available for similar prices, not including parking, which is usually another $20-50. And, the amenities like the free wireless internet were a nice touch. With the current economy, it is possible to get good hotel deals now in San Francisco--just watch the different websites and don't hesitiate to call the hotel to negotiate. Here's the quick run-down: -Great value! -Location on Union Square is great -Front-desk staff were attentive and very helpful. -Rooms were clean, seemed to be recently remodeled with decent furnishings, paint, carpet, flat-screen TV, etc. While not large, they are spacious enough and the building does not necessarily show its age. -Housekeeping could be better [One day we returned about 16:00 from a day of walking around the city and the room had not been serviced. When brought to the attention of the front desk, somone was at our room within 20 min. While this was not a disaster, we did not expect to find the room unmade at the end of the day, when all we wanted was a few hours to relax before dinner. Also, there were some minor clean-up things that were not attended-to over the course of our stay.] -Cookies and pillow menu are a nice touch. With the combo of location, good price, decent amenities and wonderful staff, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Chancellor to friends and family. In fact, I suggested it to my mother.

Susan, who works in the gift shop/tourist information was fantastic giving us advice on how to make the most of our short stay in SF. She pre-booked Alcatraz for us and the City Tour. Using her advice we purchased a MUNI pass (three day pass for $18) giving unlimited transport on the trams, street cars and buses. Their transport system is brilliant. We made great use of these passes. One day we used the passes to cross the city to the Pacific for a paddle, then back to the Golden Gate Bridge. We walked across the bridge and down the hill into Sausalito, had a lovely afternoon and got the ferry back to Pier 1! We were also up and down Powell Street to Fishermans Wharf on the cable cars all the time, great fun - even for a pair of 50+ year olds! Taxis from the airport appear to be quite expensive so we used the BART (rail system) to get from the aiport to Market Street/Powell Street (cost about $5.35 each one way). Very easy to use. Get off at Powell and walk about six blocks up Powell Street to the Chancellor. Returning to the aiport we used the shuttle service recommended by Susan for $14 each. Well worth it - knowing we had a full day travelling home ahead of us. There are a few homeless people around Union Square, apparently they filter in from the Tenderloin area (about 4 blocks behind this hotel) but we didn't have any problems with them at all.

I wish I could remember his name! He was off on the Wednesday and Thursday mornings and I really missed his big smile and friendliness. The food was scrumptious!!! The banana pancakes withe the praline syrup was the best meal I had during my entire trip! Lawrence the bellhop was a sweetheart as well. I told him that I would post a review on Trip Advisor and mention how cute he was. :) There was also a very kind electrician working at the hotel and we had a lovely conversation about the Ferry Building. I was travelling alone and it meant so much to be surrounded by so many wonderful people. The bottle of wine, 2 glasses and the picture frame were such lovely gifts. Thank you!

I had researched extensively on trip advisor and chose this hotel based on the reviews plus the hotel's own website. Our TA booked it for us, at a cheaper rate than we could, so that was a positive to begin with. On our last trip to San Francisco we had stayed at Fisherman's Wharf, but wanted to stay at Union Square this time. We were extremely pleased with everything about The Chancellor. The room size was fine, especially after having spent some time in Europe, where rooms can be very small. The bathroom may have been small, but had the requisite bath (and a nice deep one), shower over it, washbasin, toilet and a shelf for toiletries, so what more do you need? Not to mention the rubber ducky and the toiletries. I enquired whether the ducky was complimentary - not only was it, but I was given another (better) one as well. The body lotion is lovely, and there was also shampoo, bath salts, shower cap, cotton balls and cotton buds. The bed was extremely comfortable and the pillows were fine. We did not avail ourselves of the pillow menu, but there was enough there for the fussiest of sleepers. While we were there, the TVs were being changed for flatscreens. We had plenty of space in the wardrobe to hang things. We left one suitcase in it on a stand, and had the other one in the room. There was also an in room safe, which we used, an iron and ironing board, which we didn't use and an umbrella which, thankfully, we didn't need. We availed ourselves of the tea and coffee (and the occasional cookie) in the foyer, but do prefer to be able to make our own in the room. However, again it was better than the hotels where we stayed in Europe, none of which had any free tea or coffee, in the room or elsewhere. We ate breakfast in the hotel twice, and found it to be tasty and filling, and cheaper than other places. It was actually the only time on our holiday where breakfast was not provided, so found this additional meal to be an expense we'd rather not have (the Australian dollar had dropped dramatically in value while we were away, so everything became much more expensive than we'd anticipated). Our room was on the 3rd floor at the front of the hotel, so was noisy with the windows open. However, when we wanted to sleep, we just closed the windows and used the ceiling fan for cooling. And I did enjoy hearing the city noises, anyway, and at least we had a good view. The staff were always friendly and helpful, although I never did see Wes, the manager. I had enjoyed reading his trip advisor posts, both in the review section and on the San Francisco forum. We were able to leave our bags at the hotel on our departure day, which was helpful, as we had a 10.30 pm flight (all 14 and a half hous of it) home that night. A 12 noon checkout was also good - it gave me time to pack and rearrange our luggage that morning. For the price we paid and for the location I highly recommend this hotel.

Fine wines at the bar (don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember his name, but the barkeeper knew his job \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and as a Frenchman, i know a little about wines...) So, a really GREAT stay at the Chancellor for my wife and me. We definitely recommend this hotel. ... And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m now sure that Wes Tyler does exist... Thanks to him.

Check in : Easy and a friendly. We had requested a refrigerator in the room (based on one of the TA reviews\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it really was very useful) Room: Really comfortable for two people. The walk-in closet really expanded the space so that you could store your suitcases and not bump into anything. We had asked for the topmost floor overlooking the Union square, based on TA reviews and were glad for the choice. We weren't bothered by traffic or noise, and in fact found the music filtering in every evening from the Union square really charming. The sound of the cable cars and fire engines wasn't bad enough to disturb our sleep. Bathroom: Slightly on the smaller size, but big enough when we used it one at a time. Wished we had used the comfortable bath-tub (and the rubber duck). Lobby : The hotel lobby is intimate and cosy enough that you welcome coming back after a cool and tiring day. The freshly baked cookies with different types baked everyday (chocolate chip, raisin etc), coffee and apples were appreciated. Infact after the first day, when we had Starbucks, we didn't really feel the need to have any coffee elsewhere. ( I usually obsess over my coffee, and I really liked it). Location: (I hate saying \"location, location, location, location) Great. Just right next to Union square, a hop across to cafes, diners, small bistros, delis, a cable car stop right across, and very convenient for our conference also- just a block across. Staff: Rory, Steve, and the other guys at the reception- very helpful. Any question we had, use of the business center to print our boarding cards, picking up a Fedex for us and calling us up when it came- very helpful. Luques Filling breakfast with cheerful staff (especially Nancy). We had breakfast a day before the conference and it was really good. Bacon usually is too salty to eat, but even an occasional non-vegetarian like me enjoyed it. My wife had the veggie menu and felt her breakfast was ok. Smell: I know somebody had mentioned some smell in the lobby. I didn't really notice any smell except the nice smell of popcorn. There was however some funny smell in the passage outside our room. Just a minor point, and not really a big issue, as the room was comfortable, (non smelly) and the location cant be beaten. Would we come back here- Yes! in a heartbeat..

We were able to check-in 3 hours early, which was handy and were given a quiet room on the back of the hotel, which meant we never heard any street noise (just next door's TV!)

Things did not start well. Arriving in San Francisco at 5pm is not a good idea, especially for someone unfamiliar with the area. Having done several tours of the block trying to find somewhere to park and unload, eventually one of our party went into the hotel for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcguidance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as our tour of the blocks continued. Should have done that sooner! The Bell Captain came out and sorted us out, showing us where we could park and unload and helping us to unload. Check-in was efficient, if somewhat \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsterile\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and a smile or two would not have gone amiss, perhaps it had been a long day, especially as the hotel seemed very busy with the Oracle conference being in town. They explained the options for car parking as, like most city hotels, they have no attached car park. We chose the $22/day self parking option, which was a multi-storey a couple of blocks away, we just drove there and the attendants did the rest. As it turned out, this was a good option as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpublic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 car parking was more expensive and this allows as many in and outs as you like, although the public transport is so good and cheap, we just left the car in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 during our stay. The hotel itself is a (relatively) old building, built in the early 1900s so is classed as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchistorical\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and the decoration and style reflect this. Our room was on the 9th floor, not much of a view but then we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect that in any city hotel. By US standards the room was small, but very clean and tidy and well decorated. We were a bit concerned about there being no air conditioning as it was a warm day and opening the window allowed in all the San Francisco noise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c however it turned out to be part of the charm listening to the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcting ting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the street cars, the general hub hub of city life and of course the wailing sirens of police cars in the distance ! There was a ceiling fan which we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at the end of the day this was down to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcuser error\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by me. You are even offered a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpillow menu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 here to choose from a range of pillow types but the ones supplied as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstandard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 were more than adequate to complement the large, comfortable bed. Despite the local noise (with the window being open) we had no problem sleeping and it was lovely to wake up to the sound of the street cars going by. Although no coffee/tea making facilities were in the room, coffee was available in the lobby and again it would seem that most city hotels do not provide these room facilities. The strong point of this hotel is its location. Plenty of shops, diners and restaurants in the immediate locality and a two minute walk to the cable car stop \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which you just have to do ! We chose to eat out and had breakfast at Lori\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Diner a couple of blocks away \u00e2\u20ac\u201c highly recommended, we even had the two \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccops\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the next table enjoying their pancakes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just like TV! We had an evening meal at a nearby baseball themed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccarvery\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which was excellent value for money. As we already had a trip to Alcatraz booked (a not to be missed trip!) and with only one full day available, we tried to cram as much in as possible so we spoke to Susan the hotel concierge who was very helpful. She sorted us out with day passes for the public transport and booked us a three hour bus sightseeing trip of the city. We chose to use the streetcar down to Pier 39 area and benefited from a commentary by the very friendly \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbrakeman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at the back of the car, pointing out local sites and interests. Both the Alcatraz and bus trip were very good, certainly whetting the appetite for a return visit and a longer stay at the Chancellor. So all in all, a very pleasant stay at the Chancellor and we would have no hesitation in staying there again. As a footnote, I left my glasses in the hotel room, only realising later as we were on our way to Yosemite.

It was on a high floor to avoid the traffic sounds but still had a partial view of Union Square and Powell Street.

The Tour Desk booked us a nice wine tour so that I could drink before starting to self drive. The rest of our time was spent revisiting our favourite locations, travelling by cable car or local bus. The Chancellor's location is ideal for starting such expeditions and, in view of this and its many other charms, it is very reasonably priced.

The bathroom is also tiny, but well decorated in small tiles and a deep soaking tub. The place overall was extremely clean, and so relaxing and charming (it is a very old/historic hotel).

The cleaning crew cleaned in the afternoon unless you put a sign up requesting early cleaning, which was very nice. Although the place was wonderful overall, it was slightly noisy since you are right in Union Square, and during our stay there was some construction right across the street. We were never bothered by the noise, though, unless the windows were open. The walls are slightly thin, and although not generally a problem because it attracts a pretty quiet clientele, we did have to ask the person on his cell phone next to us to keep it down at 4 a.m. The bathroom is not well-ventilated, so they ask that you keep the window open while you shower, which is slightly awkward to get to and has no curtain. The window is small, however, and tucked back over the toilet. There is also no heat in the hotel, so you must use a stand alone radiator, which works okay, but not great. This was only a problem a couple nights since we had unusually cold weather. The lobby also smells slightly moldy, which several people noted during our stay.

Not to mention there is a world of amazing shopping at your feet when you step out the door! Any questions we had were answered courteously and promptly, and the valet process was great. If you have any questions at all, do not hesitate to ask any of the staff - I was in a state of disbelief with regard to how consistently friendly, cheerful, and helpful every single member of the staff was. That alone makes this hotel a standout, but it is an exceptional hotel for so many other reasons as well! If you have forgotten anything or need anything, there is a Walgreens nearby. I went into the Borders next door to the hotel to pick up a local magazine. Cabs were plentiful and easily found just outside the hotel at any time of day or night. The Chancellor is officially the only place I will stay in SF, and I will recommend the hotel to anyone and everyone without hesitation. It is truly a gem of a hotel in the heart of SF. Thank you, Chancellor and Wes, for a unbelievably wonderful and pleasant stay.

I had read the reviews and chose the Chancellor because of location primarily. We were checking in after three nights in the Bellagio in Las Vegas so I wasn't sure about how the kids would react after all of the flash and grandiosity of the previous hotel but they loved the Chancellor as did I for several reasons. First, of course location, location, location. So close to great eats (Sears was awesome for dinner and breakfast), great shopping, parking (reasonable), drug stores, transportation whether you want a quick ride to the Wharf on the F line or a thrilling ride on the cable car. It was warm in SF when we were there but we opened the windows and everything was fine with very little noise. Because the hotel is small and we saw the same employees (who would quickly recognize us) over and over again, the children were able to be a little more autonomous than usual so they were allowed to go downstairs alone to get the complimentary popcorn, apples, and cookies. My son used the ethernet connections in the lounge with me in the evenings and everyone was so friendly to him. My debit card was lost at one point and I called the front desk to ask about the location of a Wachovia bank in SF. They called around and found one that was open that day, a Saturday, called the bank to confirm the hours, mapquested the directions, highlighted the route and sent me on my happy way. I think that the age and size of the hotel give it a unique and friendly feeling that really makes you feel a part of SF. My 10 year old daughter took the yellow duck she was given at the Chancellor into every hotel pool we visited on our way home. I watched as it floated around as she was playing and on several occasions adults picked it up and read the inscription on it and asked my daughter about it and that began a lengthy and colorful conversation about her \"awesome\" trip to SF and her stay at the Chancellor.

Maybe they were for American standards but they were a normal size compared to European standards. The beds were super comfortable. I loved being able to open the window too. I prefer fresh air to air conditioning where possible. The bathroom was nicely stocked and I thought the rubber duck was a great touch. The deep bath was fantastic and not something I have found much in hotels. We had breakfast at the hotel most mornings and it was great everytime. The coffee and cookies were also a great touch.

First, as a family of four, we knew we are not the ideal customer for the Chancellor, which only has small queen or twin/twin combination rooms. But the location, service, parking option, and price were right so we went for it. The central location just off Union Square and on the cable car line is perfect. Our visit didn't get off on the great start because a really expensive two-bottle pack of wine (from our Sonoma Valley winery visit) was inadvertently left on the sidewalk outside. Matt apparently got everything except for the wine and we didn't notice until we were in the room. It was just as much our fault for not making sure we had everything before we headed up. Well, by the time we realized the wine was missing, somebody was probably already enjoying some great wine! With all that said, Matt was friendly, helpful and informative (and later apologetic about the wine). Check-in was very smooth. The hotel uses a parking garage a block over and, with the in-out privileges, it was very convenient whenever we needed to drive somewhere. Another nice thing is that the Chancellor lets you leave your car in front of the hotel while you check-in and get your stuff upstairs. As other reviewers have already pointed out (and we well knew), the rooms are on the small side and don't have AC. However, the high ceilings make the room \"feel\" bigger and the ceiling fan helps cool the room even though we were in SF during an unusually warm week. Despite the tight space, we packed our family of four in and still managed just fine. One unique thing about the Chancellor's rooms are that they each have a small walk-in closet. My 7 year old son liked sleeping on the closet floor so we all had enough room to sleep and get around! The beds were comfortable and we all slept well. The room had nice little touches like free candies, wi-fi access and an in-room safe. And unlike the vast majority of hotels who can't be bothered with it, they recycle! Also, we liked the fact that they only launder and replace towels that you place on the floor, and not all towels each day. On the downside, there was a step up into the bathroom that could pose a tripping hazard, the toilets are very loud (loud enough to be heard in adjacent rooms at night) and there was no refrigerator. Also, our third-floor room only had a view of the back of an adjacent building 10 feet away. We forgot to ask for a view. Oh well.... What separates this hotel from the average is the exceptional staff and thoughtful touches around the hotel. Everyone we encountered was very helpful and friendly. Cookies, fresh fruit, coffee, iced tea and ice water were plentiful in the lobby/bar area. We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant, Luques, several mornings, and we enjoyed the pancakes, waffles and french toast! Overall, it was a great stay!", "Date": "June 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Customer Service!\u201d", "Author": "martini", "ReviewID": "UR17227735", "Content": "We stayed at the Chancellor from Jun14-17 and absolutely loved it. The location was great, right beside Union square and near all the shops. Ton's of restaurants in the area within walking distance, sushi, pizza, chinese, all american, whatever you are in the mood for. It was easy to get to, we took the BART from the airport, took about 25minutes to get to our stop, just followed the directions, cost was $5.35each one way, walk to the hotel from the BART stop was slightly up hill along Powell, Cable car line, approx 4 blocks or so, took us maybe 10mins. Lovely reception area, check-in could not have been quicker, staff at front desk were very friendly and welcoming. They gave us a package at check-in giving us a discount for the dining area as well as 2 for 1 drinks at the hotel bar. We also received a coupon for the 11% discount at Macy's given to foreign passport holders. Now to the room. I had done my homework and was expecting a smaller size room based on everything I'd read and yes the room is smaller than some, however it is not the smallest room I've ever stayed in and I have travelled a LOT. The room was efficiently layed out, with nothing in the way of the other and SPOTLESSLY clean. I loved the rubber duck in the bathroom and the bath salts that soothed my aching blistered feet. There was more than enough room for two girls who planned on shopping and bringing takeout back to the room. The closet was huge, walkin with a safe in the back, iron, ironing board and an umbrella, just in case, I love it! There was a jar of candy on one of the tables, mint, butterscotch, cinnamon, Jolly rancher, nice touch, we had several. Room service was available, not particularily expensive, however we did not order anything becase coffee was always available and freshly baked cookies as well as apples. We would grab a coffee and cookie in the morning as well as a complimentary newspaper . As mentioned in previous reviews, there is no air conditioning, but the windows in the bathroom and the room open, allowing for air to circulate and there is a fan overhead if you need it, but I don't think you will, average temp during summer is in the mid 70's and it cools down at night. We did not use the fan. We had two single beds and covering up with the lightweight duvet was more than enough to keep us warm or cool at the same time. The bed was extremly comfortable. There is a tour desk in the lobby. They will make arrangements for any tour you like, pick up from the front lobby. We took a day tour of the city, highly recommend it, it took us to all the spots you must see, first time in SFO. If you don't want to book a tour, from this location you are within blocks of China town, taking you maybe 10-15mins to get there. We walked from the Wharf back to the hotel, took us 45 minutes, most of it uphill. No problem. Now to the part that made the biggest impression on us, the hotel staff. It wasn't just the staff at the front desk that were friendly but everyone that worked there said hello to us and smiled. Once we were getting into an elevator and the bellman who was already in the elevator got out to allow us to use the elevator first. He insisted, even though we told him we'd wait. The employee's all seemed happy to be there and ready to work, no private converstaions going on that you fear interrupting or conversations that continue while you wait for someone to notice you are waiting to ask a question and that means a lot to me. I hate feeling like someone is doing me a favour by answering a question.

I had read nearly every review listed on Trip Advisor, and I felt secure in my decision to book my room. I was not disappointed! Our experience began with being greeted curbside by Matt, the Bell Captain. He was so nice, and helped us with our suitcases and shopping bags. Check in was quick and easy, and we were off to our room within minutes. I had previously requested a room away from street noise, based upon some of the reviews on Trip Advisor, and that was a great decision. Our room was on the back side of the hotel, and we heard very little noise. I also had requested a small refrigerator to be placed in our room, and within minutes of us arriving and settling into our room, the refrigerator was delivered without any problems. (And without a reminder about it!!) The parking garage the Chancellor uses is literally a block away, and even the fellows in the garage were very kind. Our room was adorable! The color scheme was up to date, with a vibrant kelly green and off white paint, with coordinating carpet and furniture. Our room was cozy, and was just perfect with two twin beds, perfect for my Mom and I. We had no issues whatsoever with not having air conditioning, as there was a fully functioning ceiling fan, and that combined with the open window allowed for adequate ventillation. (AND...it was in the 70's each day of our stay!!) Every member of the hotel staff was friendly, especially Matt, as previously mentioned, as well as Michael, who works at the gift /transportation counter. One evening, I even went down to see if someone could \"cook\" some microwave popcorn for us so we could watch one of the in room movies. Michael was happy to do so, and came back in two minutes with my bags of popcorn for me. He was very friendly and informative regarding the location of Chinatown, and the cable car system. It was such a nice feeling to walk into the hotel each day, and have someone recognize us each time we came out of the elevator. The day before we left, I asked about using a computer to print our boarding passes, and the gal at the front desk simply said she would take care of it for me. Within a few minutes, I had my boarding passes in hand. Finally, on our last day, another bellman helped us with our bags to the lobby. While I went to pick up the car, he was summoned elsewhere. Not to worry though, as Michael came from behind his counter, and helped us load up our bags into the car. All in all, not only would I recommend this hotel to anyone who will listen based on how we were treated, but also because of the location! We couldn't have picked a better hotel! Everything we needed was within walking distance. We only drove our car from the airport to the hotel and back! The cable car line goes right in front of the hotel, which takes you right down to Fisherman's Wharf. Chinatown is about 3 1/2 blocks away, as is Macy's, and other wonderful shopping. We never did eat in the hotel restaurant, however, Sears Fine Foods next door was delightful, with their delicious Swedish Pancakes. Lori's diner was 1/2 a block away, and the convienence of having a Walgreen's just up the block made the microwave popcorn a reality. I want Wes, the hotel manager to know what a great hotel he has, and he should take pride in knowing his staff is truly amazing. Each person loves their job, and I know I wouldn't get that feeling from the people at the \"Big Name\" hotels down the street. This really is a \"Botique Hotel\", and I couldn't even make up something poor to say about this hotel.

We were also in SF for a family wedding at the ritzy St Francis across the street. After studying the different Union Square hotels, we emailed the most promising, requesting a special extended stay quote, and then wrote the Chancellor, asking could they improve on the best offer received, which they did. We were able to stay for 9 nights for less than $1,500. They even had a card & anniversary gift for us. My son and daughter in law also reserved for a shorter stay. They were also delighted & kept saying what a charming hotel (how did you ever find such a gem?). All in all, it was better than we had anticipated. Kudos to the fine staff, who responded promptly & courteously, even providing a small fridge on request. Susan, who effortlessly handles gift shop and concierge duties, arranged for terrific sightseeing trips: wine country, the redwood forest, Monterey and Carmel, Yosemite Natl Park, city sightseeing.

The Chancellor exceeded our expectations within 10 seconds of check in as we were upgraded for free to a suite, which had two full separate bathrooms, separate living room, fridge, and the all important tea and coffee making facilities. We had requested a room on a high floor with a nice view if possible our suite didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a view so perhaps they we unable to give us a normal room with a view so they bumped us up to the suite? This was just my thinking anyhow and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have taken the suite over a view anyhow!! We have very little interaction with hotel staff in general unless we have a problem-we had no problems in the Chancellor so our interactions were limited although all the staff were warm and friendly from the cleaners to the front desk staff.

Having visited many properties I think they are too modest to call themselves a \"3 star hotel in a 5 star neighborhood\" I think they are a solid 3 1/2! We are a family of four. We took two adjoining rooms which I recommend for a family group. This is not the Four Seasons or the Ritz Carlton. If you are looking for a pool and a spacious modern room then you should look elsewhere. If your tastes are more modest the courteous staff from the attentive front desk to the chamber maids makes this hotel a good choice. The hotel was built in 1914 and sits right on one of the main cable car lines adjacent to Union Square. It's a great location if you are looking to travel around and see the sites in the City. The only downside to the location is if you are a light sleeper this is near SF's theatre district. When the bars close at 2am you can hear folks milling around at street level. We were told that the hotel had completed a renovation in the last year where the guest rooms were upgraded. The beds were comfortable and the furniture in our room was new, one comment here is larger TVs in the guest rooms would be a plus. When on vacation with the family we are not looking to lounge in our hotel room during the day. We were in town to visit family and travel around the area. When you left in the morning or returned in the evening you could take a apple and a cookie from a display in the lobby. At the end of the day during happy hour there often was a popcorn wagon set up near the bar which the kids (and adults) enjoyed.

With its Union Square location, the Chancellor Hotel is surrounded by many great restaurants, high end shopping and of course, the cable car line which runs directly in front of the hotel. China Town is also within walking distance or a quick cable car ride up Powell Street, then down into China Town. We had a rental car and used the off-site parking garage for $22/night. The parking garage is located on 450 Sutter Street and is only about a block from the Chancellor. The parking garage is open 24 hours a day and is staffed by valets who bring you the car so you don't have to worry about parking or retrieving the car. We had our reservations for about 4 months and requested a high floor room with a view and also a refrigerator. As we checked in, the front desk staff was friendly and helpful and offered to have our luggage taken up to our room. The hotel lobby is small, but tastifully decorated and very clean. The hotel also has a small, yet cozy little bar with a few tables and a TV. The Chancellor also has a tour desk with a knowlegable staffer to help you with directions, reservations etc. As has also been mentioned by many others, The Chancellor provides complimentary cookies (penut butter, oat meal etc.) coffee and tea in the lobby for use by its guests 24 hours a day. My wife and I often took advantage of these amenities after a long day of exploring San Francisco. Our room was on the 14th floor and had a nice view of Union Square and the Sir Francis Drake Hotel across the street. We could also view a small portion of San Francisco Bay, which was an added bonus. The rooms were very clean and well decorated. Our queen sized bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. We also enjoyed the large walk in closet so that we could hang up our clothes and store our luggage. In the closet was an extra blanket, ironing board & iron and a heater, if needed. The TV worked well and had many cable channels. Next to each bed was a night stand with a lamp and one of the night stands had a nice clock/radio. The ceiling fan in our room was also a nice touch, as it really moves the air in the room, as the hotel does not have air conditioning. The windows can also be opened too, which we did when we were gone from the room for the day. The bathroom was very cute, functional and more than adequate for our needs as we were well aware that the hotel was built in 1914. Some people have said that the rooms are small and I tend to disagree, as the rooms, while not spacious, are more than adequate for 2 persons especially if you consider the large walk in closets. I would not recommend that more than 2 people stay in a room, as it could get a little cramped for space, but the hotel makes that point perfectly clear on its website. We really loved our stay at the Chancellor Hotel and would highly recommend it for any couple wanting a very nice, clean, affordable hotel with a friendly and knowledgable staff in arguably the best location in San Francisco. For us, the Chancellor Hotel was a grand slam and everything we hoped it would be.", "Date": "February 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin,", "Title": "\u201cI Loved this Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Dub_Travaller", "ReviewID": "UR13616069", "Content": "I loved this hotel.

The hotel is beautiful- although it's old, it has been fully refurbished and is absolutely pristine. The guest rooms and the lobby are filled with character. The rooms are beautifully furnished and they are absolutely spotless. I'm a slob and the maid removed all evidence the mess I created every single day. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the free in-room WiFi was icing on the cake. I was most deeply impressed by the staff of the hotel. I didn't catch names, but every person who helped me was oustanding. I was amazed when my breakfast was brought up to my room and the person who delivered it started asking me how I like the room and then explained how it had been completely redone. This was a great indication of the pride this person felt in the Chancellor- if you're going to engage me in a chat about how the room was redone while you deliver my breakfast, you're obviously pretty proud to be working there. That sums up my experience with the Chancellor- everyone seemed to be proud to be there and the ruboff of that pride was excellent service all around. It was so great to get to experience a city like San Francisco while staying in a hotel like The Chancellor. I am now looking to return to San Francisco with my wife and family for leisure.

We had a midweek matinee and a good parking deal at the Chancellor, so we decided to go back, which I had hoped to do anyway because of all of the wonderful recent reviews and I wanted to see the room refurbishing. We decided to make it a two night stay. There are two main things which impressed me, especially as compared to the myriad hotels in San Francisco that we have visited over the years. The first is the staff. I swear that the general manager, WesTyler, must have trained this staff in customer relations. Or else they are just genuinely great people...they don't ACT trained, it seems genuine. The front desk clerks are smart, efficient, friendly, and alert. The bellboys keep track of when your room is ready if you arrive early and efficiently keep track of various people's luggage. both checking in and checking out. The woman at the Tour Desk (which we did not use) is available for questions and help...she is probably the equivalent of a 'concierge' in a larger hotel. (She will also laugh with you when you come in from the rain soaking wet.) The staff in the restaurant is not only efficient and attentive, but cheery and fun. They really seem to enjoy what they are doing and always wish you a good day when you leave. If you run into a member of the housekeeping staff in the hallway as you are entering or leaving your room, you can always count on a greeting with a smile, ...\"good morning\"...for example. The refurbished rooms are delightful, with a classy decor, beds and linens and comforters you wish you could take home with you. SO....this is an older hotel, brought up to boutique/charming style. Don't expect 300 square foot rooms, air conditioning, huge modern bathrooms. You may find a welcome walk-in closet. You will not have air-conditioning, but you will have a window which opens and a ceiling fan to circulate the air. Actually, you will need not to worry about A/C at all in SF. You will need to worry about heat, if you are in your room during the day on cold days. The hotel has an efficient way of turning on the heat at about 5 o'clock in the evening and turning it off later in the morning, but if you are in your room during the day and get cold, look in your walk-in closet you will find a modern electric 120 v \"radiator\" which you can trot out to warm your toes. It is not really a problem, just a caution for extra cold days if you plan to \"stay in\". OKAY, Wes.....your turn. But please share what I said about your staff with them.

When I checked into the Chancellor yesterday, it felt like coming home. This is probably my 10th trip to this hotel, and I would never stay anywhere else in San Francisco. One of the many reasons I enjoy this hotel is that it is a true San Francisco style hotel. It is not a large, boxy, giant roomed modern hotel. Why come to an interesting city like San Francisco and stay at a place like that? You might as well go to Vegas if that's the experience you want. This is is quaint, cozy, old school San Francisco. If you've ever looked at any of the houses or flats in the City (and I have, since I lived here for 20 years), you'll see the same sort of architecture. Things are compact here in San Francisco with interesting little touches, and that's what you'll find at the Chancellor. Yes, the rooms are small. That makes them cozy and sweet. Most of them have a gigantic closet to store your things which more than makes up for their compactness. Staying here actually makes you FEEL like you're in San Francisco. Add to that the sounds of the City floating through your room and you have a complete San Francisco experience. I can't believe someone complained about the Chancellor's decor in another review. Clearly that person should have stayed at a giant no-personality chain hotel. The Chancellor's decor is old school SAN FRANCISCO, which is what makes it so wonderful. It's also hard to believe someone would complain that they have to sign and initial the check in form! Being a hotel owner myself, I realize the need to point things out to people personally and to actually ask that they initial something to confirm they've read the point in question. Plain and simple, all of those items are important, and many people just don't take the time to read details. To the hotel, it's good business practice. To the guest, it takes an extra 3 or 4 seconds, if that. The kind of person who would take offense at that probably should have just stayed home. My husband and I have been coming to this hotel for almost two years. In that time, the faces at the hotel haven't changed a bit -- we see the entire staff time and time again. To me, that's the sign of a great establishment: essentially no staff turnover. They have always been courteous and friendly and ready to help with any request given them. We love the breakfasts in the restaurant and believe it is probably the best breakfast in the City. And the hotel prices are fabulous compared to other hotels in San Francisco. I personally can't believe they didn't win a 2008 Travelers' Choice Award this year, after having won one in the past (for Best Bargain), but then it appears that many hotels that have won awards in the past didn't win them this year. They will always be THIS traveler's choice. Keep up the great work, Chancellor. You're doing everything right. I'm here at the hotel now and will be back again in a week.

The room was quiet, clean, newly decorated and the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was reasonably priced and tasty; service was cheerful and professional. In fact, all of the staff was courteous, knowledgable and helpful (e.g., they take it as a challenge to get you online via their WIFI system, which I am finding is difficult to do with Microsoft's Vista software, but they persisted in helping me -- and succeeded, more than I can say about the other, much more expensive, hotel where we stayed on this trip).

A tip - if you want a really quiet room, ask for one at the back of the hotel above floor 10. We took breakfast every morning in the hotel's restaurant, Luques. Excellent food and service and great value. Try the scrambled egg with greens! We also liked their \"Protester\" breakfast - juice, coffee, fresh fruit cup and wholewheat toast - and there are other options. We would definitely stay here again.

I bought tickets for two Giant's games and wanted to find the perfect little hotel for us to stay in. Location: I've been to San Fran many times before, and I love Union Square... so, this hotel couldn't be more perfectly located. Right on Union Square with a Cable Car stop right out the front door, with very easy access to public transportation (we bought a 3 day muni pass for $18 dollars, a great deal because PT in this city is very convenient), and LOADS of shopping nearby. Cost: I wanted to go on the cheaper side for hotel cost, since I had just spent a bunch on baseball tickets, so you really cant beat the price at the Chancellor. I did a ton of research on TripAdvisor and other hotel websites, and I knew that this was the place to stay. I got a great rate of around $100 per night, and I had origianlly only booked one night at first. After arriving at the hotel we realized that we had found a true gem and we immediately called the front desk to see if they could accomodate us for another night. The front desk was more than helpful in extending our stay and also made sure we wouldn't have to move our stuff into another room the next day. Simply flawless and friendly service. Room: I requested a room that was on a higher floor, newly renovated and facing union square. When we checked in we got a corner room on the ninth floor overlooking union square. Perfect. Bed was very comfortable, bathroom was small but very functional. This is an older building so it has it's quirks and imperfections, but that all adds to the charm... so just keep that in mind. From reading past reviews, it seems that they are very good at accomodating every guest's requests... but I'm sure that there will be times when people's requests can't be met, but thats just how it goes. This hotel really goes out of its way to make their guests happy, so no one should let a little thing like tat ruin their stay. Service: Again, the service here is fantastic. The woman at the front desk was so nice and helpful, and make checking in a total breeze (we even arrived several hours before normal \"check in\" time, but this didn't seem to be a problem in our case). The bartender was also quite friendly and mixed some good drinks. Overall, you get great value for the money you pay. In a city like SF you can expect to pay tons of money at any hotel, so paying the rate you pay at the Chancellor, its almost like robbery! Simply cannot say enough good things about his hotel.

These touches require a certain obsession with being the best hotel possible, within the limits of the hotels architecture and age. This commitment to excellence, perhaps commonplace when the Chancellor was built, has become a rarity in our time. The hotel is old but is by no means rundown. The paint our room was fresh and the carpet was new. Furniture has been updated. But it is not the Marriott or Ritz Carlton. As Wes frequently writes...do not stay here if you are looking for a luxury hotel. Rooms here are adequately sized but not spacious. Our room featured a queen bed, writing desk, small end table flank. The walk-in closet was huge. Since we were able to place all of our bags in the closet, we had more useable space in the room itself. Bathrooms are charming but not very large. There is no air conditioning. Do stay here if you are looking for lots of value for not much money...an immaculate room....and welcoming staff....and lots of little touches..... The Chancellor is rated by TA readers as one of the best value hotels around. Given the prices for other hotels in the heart of SF, we wholeheartedly agree. We spent more for dinner for two than for our room! Wes, thanks to you and your staff for helping to make our trip special and for a reminder of the real difference a commitment to excellence can make.", "Date": "October 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, N.Ireland", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "KC-belfast", "ReviewID": "UR10425330", "Content": "We stayed here for two nights a few weeks ago.

You need to do the rooms justice! From the site I thought the more basic rooms would look like the homepage pics but they don't which is a good thing! Couldn't really fault our stay - loved the room - must have been done up recently (again, does your website make this clear Chancellor Hotel?) in a very funky but restrained way. Felt like a retro, botique style and not stiff, prim or chintzy like so many overpriced supposedly up market places. Bed was fab - good mattress, choice of pillows. We overlooked union square but despite that, not too noisy (12th floor) Bathroom could be a little too 'retro' for some people - think the fittings are the same as before renovation and looked a little old but spotlessly clean so who cares? If you are fussy about your bathroom this could be an issue but all we want is enough space and a decent shower and for it to be clean to it ticked all our boxes there. No fridge in room which seemed odd at first but didn't really miss it and you can get ice down the corridor. Breakfast room service was OK but never been over impressed anywhere so can't fault the effort. Staff were great accross the board - friendly and helpful at desk and in the bar, prompt room service. Gave the place a really pleasant atmosphere. I asked for a room that I saw on the trip advisor site and got it which i hadn't expected and it was my girlfriends birthday - they supplied a card and bottle of good, red wine which was a really nice touch. Thanks Chancellor! Location is very convenient. We weren't that keen on Union Sqaure area itself but if you want to shop - this is the place to be. Best things going for location are the cable car right outside to take you to more interesting areas such as North Beach, Russian Hill etc. Unless you are taking a boat trip, advise staying well clear of Fisherman's Wharf (although sea lions are great fun!) as its tacky, packed and doesn't do San Fran justice - much better to hang out in funky neighbourhoods or go to Golden Gate state park. Ferry to Sansaulito highly recommended - pretty little town with great eating options over the bay. China town, city lights bookstore, north beach cafes and bars all an easy walk away - these were our favourite places to hang out and wander and Chancellor was the perfect place to come back and chill after walking around all day.

I decided to give the Chancellor Hotel a try due to it's reviews. Hotels as a whole are expensive in San Francisco & this one seemed to be a bit more moderately priced. My expectations were not high but my hopes were. As we entered the lobby my heart sank as it is drab, dreary & dull! We continued up to our room in one of the tiny elevators. Following the narrow hallway to our room, it made me think of historical hotels we've stayed in in NYC & Europe. We were pleasantly surprised when we entered our room! Although the room was very small (no room for a roll away), it was tastefully decorated. It's bedding was excellent. It had 4 pillows (you can request a variety of options), a fiberfill mattress topper, as well as 2 duvets with excellent linens. The carpet was newish with a tasteful plaid. The windows had sheers plus black out drapes which allowed sleeping in. Ours looked out on Powell & since we were on the third floor, when the window was open, it was very noisy. However, when closed it was very quiet & did not cause us any problem. ( They should do commercials for the effectiveness of their windows.) You would not be able to sleep with it open due to the noise, however. The hotel is not air conditioned but a ceiling fan was very efficient & served our needs. The bathroom is so tiny two people can't be in it at the same time, unless one wants to stand in the bathtub. However, it has a nice makeup mirror, good shower head, & plenty of lighting. In the room we appreciated & took advantage of the suitcase stands & safe & ice machine down the hall. In the lobby we enjoyed the gratis coffee, cookies, apples & newspapers provided. All the staff we met were pleasant & accommodating. We were very impressed with Susan who books tours, etc, as she seems to work at least 12 hour days in little more than a closet.

I booked the trip as a surprise 40th birthday present for him but we decided to travel in September to coincide with our wedding anniversary. Like many other people I had emailed Wes in advance and he pre-allocated us a \"nice room\" (room 1003). It was a corner room with a side view of Powell/Union Square and we couldn't fault it. The decor was lovely, the bed was nice and comfortable, the bath amazing and the power shower was an added bonus. Unlike some people we didn't find the room small - it had a Queen bed, dressing table, coffee table, two chairs and two bedside tables. The closet is massive & you can easily store your suitcases out of the way. The bath is also huge and you can actually fit two people into the bathroom fairly comfortably. In addition to our great room we also received a load of gifts from the hotel in recognition of both my husband's birthday and our anniversary - whilst we really, really appreciated this it is not the free stuff that sets the hotel apart from others, but the attitude of the staff and the absolute attention to detail. Everyone we encountered was professional, helpful, happy and keen to help. The free cookies and coffee are welcome (and delicious) but the hotel breakfast in Luques is also really good. Portions are huge, service is great, there is a wide range of choice with daily specials and the prices are reasonable - we dined there several time and it was always great. In addition to Luques we also found two really nice restaurants - Scalas, directly across the street (beautiful Italian food & great service) and Colibris on Geary Street - if you do go there the guacomole is a must. It is made fresh in front of you and is delicious - and the creme brulee is even better. The things we enjoyed most in SF are as follows: A trip to Muir Woods and Sonoma Wine Country. We booked with Extranomical (as recommended by Wes) and it was a fantastic experience. This company showed us 3 different wineries and also lots of the sights & history of SF; A trip to Alcatraz - we took the evening tour, which is really atmospheric but you must book in advance if you want to go; A bike ride over the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito & then the ferry back. Sausalito is well worth a trip but note some bike companies will only hire if you have photo ID - Blazing Saddles does not ask for photo ID; The Musee Mecanique at Fishermans Wharf is a \"museum\" dedicated to old arcade games & attractions. Everything works and only costs 25 cents to play - it's a great laugh. Our Top Tips - If you plan on riding the cable cars, buy a MUNI pass. You can get 1, 3 or 7 day passes for various sums.

Needed a hotel within my employer's rather stingy daily limit. I was somewhat familiar with the Union Square area but would not have found the Chancellor without the great reviews from the TripAdvisor community. My first use of TripAdvisor for business travel but it won't be my last. This is a great property for business travelers. The room and queen bed were totally comfortable. The decor (see traveler photos) is warm and welcoming. Loved the high ceiling and ceiling fan for that at-home feel. My room had a walk-in closet with two luggage racks. Plenty of hot water in the bathroom. Staff friendly and not intrusive. No problems checking in at 10:30pm. Very quiet within the hotel. There was some city noise coming from Union Square but that's probably true of many area hotels. Overall a very clean and updated room yet the old-time charm of the building was still present. Wireless internet service free, fast, and reliable...encrypted with a separate network per floor. Two AC outlets on the desk. Really important features for those who need them. I did not try the on-site bar & restaurant but did see a couple of guests taking advantage of their restaurant table to review business plans. There is access to a nearby gym if you need it (I didn't have the time). Staff was helpful arranging shuttle and holding my bags after checkout while I spent a final day touring sites I never reached on previous trips: marina district, Palace of Fine Arts, Presidio/GG Bridge, GG Park, Haight-Ashbury, Alamo Square, and a sunset cocktail at the Top of the Marks (Intercontinental Mark Hopkins hotel, the view is well worth the cost of your drink). Get a muni pass and get going! The Chancellor is directly on Powell Street cable car line and you can board about 30 yards from the front door towards Sutter Street. I won't bother posting my photos as those from other travelers are quite accurate.

This was our second visit, and part of an anniversary trip, so I contacted Wes the manager before we travelled and he helped me to arrange a special treat for our arrival. Not only did we find a bottle of wine and a special gift for our anniversary, but some beers and nuts for my husband (he is a simple pleasures kind of guy!) The hotel room (1103) was great - we had a corner view of Union Square, and although we could hear the cable cars quite clearly, they just added to the experience of San Francisco. We purchased a pair of MUNI passes from the tour desk and made full use of them during our stay. We travelled regularly on the cable cars (which were quite busy, but another part of the San Fran experience). We also walked down to Market Street and caught the F Line historic trams, which go all the way along the Embarcadero to Fisherman's wharf. Top tip - take the $20 trip across the Golden Gate Bridge - it only takes 1 and a half hours, but you get to stop off at the Palace of Fine Arts and take pictures of the city from the other side of the bridge. We also took a $10 sunset cruise under the bridge, which was well worth the money, if a little chilly!! Anyway, back to the hotel - I didn't get the chance to meet Wes in person to thank him for his help in making our stay special, but I didn't really have the need to speak to any of the staff apart from at check-in, as we had no problems the entire duration of our stay. That said, whenever we made our way through the entrance foyer, we were always hailed with a greeting by whoever was on the check-in desk. Little things like that, along with the jars of sweets and rubber ducky, made our second stay at the Chancellor just as good, if not better, than our first.

Though, please note that the Chancellor is not a 5 star hotel - my review is based on the fact that for what we paid for the room (some 130 USD per night) the hotel was more than fulfilling my expectations. This hotel was the best value for money that we got during our whole month long stay in the US, and I highly recommend this hotel to others too. The only negative I have is that we took the valet parking which was rather expensive, and when we got the car back it was covered with seagull [--]! Not nice.

The hotel staff were very friendly and were more than happy to assist us with information and even gave us a list of hotels to book on our last night because the Chancellor was full. The parking is literally only a 2 minute walk away and was well worth the additional money we paid to know the car was safely stowed and yet we could get at it for a trip to Berkley at the drop of a hat.

This was our first trip to San Francisco and I don't think it will be the last - for all subsequent stays we will choose the Chancellor. Location: You couldn't be better placed to explore the city. The hotel is right in the middle of Union Square, giving you easy access to great restaurants, shops and bars. We found it very easy to walk to all the key areas including Chinatown, Nob Hill, Fisherman's Wharf and the financial district and if we didn't feel like walking, then the cable car and cabs stopped just outside. Room: Was exactly what I expected. Bearing in mind the price, you aren't going to get 5* luxury but I am exceedingly fussy when it comes to hotels and it ticked pretty much every box for me. The room was adequately spacious with nice furniture. The bed was very comfortable and they offer every type of pillow you could possible imagine. The bathroom was fine too with a great shower and free toiletries. The room was cleaned daily. It could get a little warm from time to time, but I found I was cold a lot outside so it was a relief! A tip though, I would request a room away from Powell Street as it could get noisy with the cable car right outside. We were relieved to have a room at the back! Food: We ate at Sears for 3 mornings running which I can highly recommend. However, we ended up using the hotel restaurant for the last 2 mornings and I have to say that I wished we had gone there every day instead! The food was very good quality, a great selection (from unhealthy to healthy), reasonably priced and the staff were very helpful. Staff: The reception and restaurant staff were exemplary, particularly Rory who was very helpful with directions, change and advice for exploring the city. The tour desk lady was also good, although a little abrupt at times. We found ourselves using the reception staff more as they always had a smile. The bar is serviced by their 'employee of the year' who was good but didn't seem to favour the tourists so much, more the regulars! If you want really friendly service I would go elsewhere. All in all, this should be your No.1 choice for a hotel whilst staying in San Francisco! A couple of other tips for the city in general: - Book a night tour to Alcatraz - easily the spookiest way to explore the former prison and escape a majority of the crowds - A wine tour to Napa is well worth it - we used San Francisco Shuttle Tours and it was a brilliant day out with a very helpful tour guide ([--]) -The bay does get cold so bring warm clothes and sensible shoes for all those hills - If you get time, hire bikes from Blazing Saddles and head over the GG bridge to Sausalito which is a beautiful little riverside town - very picturesque. - SF doesn't seem to have a late night life - we headed out for a drink at 10pm on a Friday night and everywhere was shut!", "Date": "September 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canton, MI", "Title": "\u201cI have recommended The Chancellor to friends\u201d", "Author": "MIRay", "ReviewID": "UR8655198", "Content": "We found the Chancellor Hotel on Trip Advisor - and were very happy we did.

I had found the Chancellor on Trip Advisor and booked two rooms for my Father -in Law and my husband and I .

The rooms are very small but it reminded me of European hotels but this one is much nicer than what I stayed at in Paris. The rooms were newley refirbished and very very clean and fresh. Very tastefuly decorated and we loved the curtians that keep out the early morning light. The hotel offers several types of pillows you can chose from if you do not like the ones in your room and its Free !!. Think of Down, hypoallergic, scented and many more. The beds have tailored bedding with down comforters. The room has no A/C but a celing fan and the windows opened up to let in lot's of air. You do need to close them at night as the city is loud, unless you like that. Yet, when they are closed you don't hear a thing. Impressive windows. The room has a safe, iron & board, soaps, shampoos etc and the signature yellow rubber duck for the bath. We were well taken care of and I would highly recomend the Chancelor... as long as you don't need a large room and like spotless and cozy comfort.. We did. They may have larger rooms I didn't ask but I am sure the excellent staff at the chancelor Hotel would be happy to help. They also offer portable spas for your in room bath. They charge a small fee but I am sure after a busy day in the city a little in-room pampering at such a reasonable fee is worth it. On another note, the Cable Cars pass by the hotel and you can purchase a day pass for $11.00 vs. $5.00 per ride. The hotel offers valet parking and they had our car back to us very quickly in the morning.. Thanks.

By the positive interaction I had had with Wes Tyler, who is the hotel's general manager, and his staff prior to our vacation, I was already certain we were going to have a wonderful stay at the hotel. We rode BART from SFO to the Powell St. station. We had a bit of an uphill walk on very crowded sidewalks to get to the hotel but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too bad. Upon check in we were delighted to hear that we had been upgraded to a Romance Suite. This was a wonderful start to an amazing vacation. The lobby of the Chancellor is very lovely. Be sure to check out the elaborate crown moldings. The girl at check in was very welcoming and told us our room would be ready shortly. The delicious cookies I had read about were awaiting us in the lobby so I used our extra time to try one out-Yummy! We also bought our muni passes right there in the lobby. Soon our room was ready and we rode up the elevator to room 1502. I want to add here that contrary to some of the posts I had read, although our room was on the 15th floor ,we never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for an elevator. We were pleasantly surprised again by the Chancellor with a wonderful collection of gifts including a lovely wooden picture frame, chocolates, champagne, glasses and a thoughtful card congratulating us on our 20th anniversary (Thanks Wes!). We were so touched. The suite was two adjoining rooms that seemed to have been two identical regular rooms at some point. One had a sofa bed, two chairs, a desk, TV, and a full bath. The other had a queen size bed, armoire, a 2nd TV, side tables and ANOTHER full bath! Upon entering the room with the bed, we felt as if we had tiptoed into the twilight zone. It was so bizarre; the bed had our same Croscill bedding that we have at home! What are the chances? Besides this, the print behind the bed is the exact one that I have in my living room here at home. The armoire was also strikingly similar to ours. I guess Wes and staff really wanted to make us feel at home but I must say it was a little freaky! It is an old hotel with lots of character. I loved the enormous arched windows in both rooms as well as the crown moldings and walk in closet. There were also hard candies and magazines provided in the room which was a nice touch. Both bathrooms had a slight step up to them as well as VERY deep bathtubs. Although the tubs had handrails, I could see where the bathrooms could be very difficult for anyone with mobility impairments. The bathroom amenities included swabs, cotton balls, soaps, shampoo/conditioner (bring your own if like me, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the mix), lotion, bath salts and an adorable rubber ducky (the ducky can go home with you, I asked!). The hotel also offered free wireless service in the room which my husband was very happy about. There was also free internet use in the lobby. In addition to the cookies, there were apples, coffee and fresh hot popcorn provided each day. There was also an extensive pillow menu that you could choose from with magnetic, snore stopping, bath and a variety of other pillows. We found the ones on the bed so comfortable that we didn't feel a need to try any others. The bed was also quite comfortable. Between the armoire, nightstand tables and the deep closet, we had more than enough room to store our belongings. There was also a safe in the room and a radio with an MP3 hook up. In the bathroom, there was a spa item menu that you could rent items from. Everything had to be returned by 12:00 the next day. There was a foot massager, bubble pad, a whirlpool machine and a variety of other items. I rented the whirlpool machine for my aching legs but it didn't seem to work very well, maybe because the tub is so deep. I let the girt at the desk know this and although I didn't ask for it to be done, I noticed I wasn't charged for it when I checked out. As we entered through the door of our room after exploring the city the first day, there was a strange intermittent blinking red light greeting us. Could it be that we had truly entered the Twilight Zone? As it turns out, there is a very large blinking neon sign for Harry Denton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Starlight Room at the Sir Francis Drake right outside our room! We pulled the curtains shut which obliterated all but a slight twinkling rosy glow and fell asleep to the ding of the cable cars and the music of the night. We didn't find the light or the outside noise bothersome. We did have the window closed every night but the ceiling fan provided sufficient cooling. In case you don't already know, there is no air conditioning in the hotel! The trolley does stop right outside the hotel, but during our summer stay it was very busy unless it was early in the morning. There are many bus stops nearby and Chinatown, Nob Hill and North Beach are an easy (although sometimes hilly) walk. There are also lots and lots and lots of stores withing walking distance. We had a view of many of these as well as the square from our window. We did have the pleasure of meeting the celebrated Wes Tyler during our stay. He was as nice in person as he seems to be in his responses in the TripAdvisor forum. There was a fire drill planned at the hotel later in the day and although he seemed busy, he still took the time to meet with us. We thanked him for our spacious room and the thoughtful gifts that were left for us. All of the staff at the hotel were very friendly and personable throughout our stay. Check out was very simply and quick too. If you are expecting a luxurious, modern, state of the art hotel you will probably be quite disappointed here. If you are expecting abundant smiles and pleasant service, thoughtful (and quacking) amenities, wonderful architectural details in a historic building, and a fantastic location, your expectations will be exceeded!", "Date": "August 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cservice, service ,service!\u201d", "Author": "chicagosuburbanite", "ReviewID": "UR8274393", "Content": "We read about Chancellor on Trip Advisor and decided to give it a try.

This year, we stayed six nights at the Chancellor Hotel after reading many excellent reviews of the property on TripAdvisor. The hotel far exceeded our expectations. We stayed in Room 1000, requesting this particular room after reading reviews indicating how nice a room it was. The hotel graciously granted our room request. The room overlooked Powell Street, and on a clear day, we could see the Ferry Building Clock Tower. The ceiling fan combined with an open window provided more than adequate air circulation. The sounds of cable cars and street traffic were all part of the SF experience and were welcomed by my wife and me. Many people have noted the excellent location of the Chancellor with respect to shopping, tourist attractions, restaurants, etc... All of this is very true. We used mass transit (cable cars, streetcars, Muni trains and buses) to go wherever we wished to go. This was very economical (7 Day Muni Passport) and convenient. We took advantage of the Giants baseball package on two of the days of our visit. This not only allowed us to have terrific field level seating for the baseball games, but also provided us with food/beverage credits in the hotel restaurant and bar. We ate breakfast in Luques Restaurant (within the hotel) on three different mornings. The food was excellent (especially the French Toast) and the restaurant staff very pleasant. In fact, the entire hotel staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and \"at home.\" Our room was more than adequate in size for two adults. The safe within the room was a very nice feature as was the extra large closet, and the housekeeping service was excellent.

We nearly starved in the morning by their non-existent breakfast, cookies and coffee only! To top it all off, we were harassed by a vagrant outside the hotel! OK, none of that is true. Did I trick you Wes? I read every single review before visiting this hotel and researched the hotel's web site and others. I got exactly what I expected and we had a great time. I am always hot, but there really is no need for a/c in SF. We actually closed the window at night because it was a little chilly. I can't see a need for anymore than 2 elevators? We never had to wait more than a minute or two for it to come. The rooms were a bit small compared to other hotels I've stayed, but we spend only sleeping time in the room. Even if we spent more time in the room, I don't believe I would have a problem with the size. Yes, when the window is open, it is very noisy outside, but I enjoyed it. I live in a quiet suburb and it was exciting having the business of the city right outside. When I did want it quiet, we closed the window and hardly heard a thing, we were on the 6th floor not the 15th. I'm not sure what people are talking about paper thin walls. Our walls in room 600 were solid masonry. Maybe we didn't have any neighbors during our stay, but I couldn't imagine it being noisy still. The hotel never advertised any breakfast of any kind, so this was not a shock. But the cookies were delicious and we had one everyday, I'm not a coffee drinker, so that didn't bother me. Sears Fine Food next door has a great breakfast. And yes, there are homeless people and street entertainers on the streets of San Francisco that will ask for money, but I don't know if there are any hotels in SF that can say this won't be the case. Overall it was a great stay and like most people have said, the rooms are clean, the staff is helpful (all of the staff I encountered spoke English very well), it's a great value and great location.

It is a nicely sized room for a boutique hotel of its vintage and quite honestly still comparable to many rooms that are much much newer. Bless you all that read and post on this site but I think too many of you, especially those of us here on the West Coast have been spoiled by the luxury SUITES in Las Vegas and compare those to regular hotels. Remember, those are suites and they're primary goal is to get you into their hotel so that you gamble and leave all your money behind. That's not so with this hotel. I found the staff to be extraordinary, they never tried to upsell me anything, whether it be tours, upgrade rooms or even their room service or restaurant. In fact I asked several of the staff for advice on numerous things and they always suggested what would be the easiest and cheapest way of doing things. I found that very refreshing. They spoke to me as a friend and not some pre-rehearsed routine like so many of the big hotels do. They weren't trying to take my money, they were trying to help me enjoy my whole San Francisco experience. I'm not sure what General Manager Wes Tyler puts in their water, but whatever it is...it works. They entire staff has bought into it and the funny thing about it is, I think he's told them to just be themselves and not worry about impressing the guests...BUT I AM IMPRESSED.

I chose the Chancellor because of location, price, and most importantly, the rave reviews on Trip Advisor. Not only was I not disappointed, I was totally blown away by the high level of service I received from the entire staff. This was my first time traveling a long distance alone with my 15-year-old daughter (we're from the east coast), and I was pretty anxious about the trip. My daughter has type 1 diabetes and is insulin-dependent. She is also a typical teenager. Having read about the small rooms, I was somewhat concerned that we would drive each other crazy. I requested a quiet room on an upper floor and a refrigerator for my daughter's insulin. We were given a corner room on the 14th floor at the back of the hotel. I found the room size to be perfectly fine. It was very clean, bright, and not crowded at all. As others have mentioned, the closet is very large. We had room for all of our stuff, and knowing how changeable the SF weather can be, we brought enough clothes for a month-long stay! The room was extremely quiet with the windows closed. However, our location was perfect for leaving them open and enjoying the sounds of the city without being overwhelmed by the noise. I can't speak about thin walls because the room beside us was empty during our entire five-night stay. The central location is excellent. We went all over the city and only used public transportation (get a Muni pass!) and foot power. Exploring SF this way really enhanced our experience. I cannot speak highly enough about the staff. One incident will stand out for me forever. The refrigerator in our room froze several cartridges of two types of insulin, and they could no longer be used. My health insurance company refused to allow me to use a co-pay when replacing the insulin. The total out-of-pocket cost was over $350! I was very shaken and upset. When I spoke to hotel staff, they immediately offered to buy the insulin for me. A member of the desk staff, Mike, walked with me to Walgreens, waited with me while the prescriptions were filled, and paid the pharmacy for the insulin. While we waited, he was very kind and reassuring. He told me over and over that I should not worry about anything and should just enjoy my trip. I am a single mom on a very tight budget. This meant the world to me. I will never forget that kindness. I get teary-eyed just thinking about it. Wes has stated over and over on Trip Advisor that if you need something, just ask. My experience is proof that he means what he says. I wish I could give the Chancellor more than five stars because they earned it. Wes, I know you read all of the reviews here.

This was our first trip to this wonderful city, we had all kinds of recommendations on where to stay.

We made a wise choice, the location of this hotel is excellent for a tourist and the price was about average for a room in the city. Located right in the middle of the retail center of the city, the are many retail stores, restaurants and local pubs to chose from. Do NOT rent a car when you go. When we arrived in the city, we took the BART train from the airport to the Powell Street station, which put us four blocks from the hotel. Only cost us $5.15 each for the train to the Powell street station. To get around the city, you can use the Cable Cars, which are right out front of the hotel, or catch one of the city buses which can get you to just about anywhere in the city at $1.50 a trip. However, you can purhase in the Hotel Lobby a Muni Pass which gives you unlimited access to the cable cars and buses during your stay. As for the hotel itself, it was very nice, it is an old hotel but has been well kept and is in great shape. The staff was very friendly, they were more than willing to help us with our questions and directions to various places in the city. In addition to purchasing your Muni Pass for transportation, you can also book all of your tours in the lobby at the same prices you would pay anywhere else. Very convenient. The only negative we have for this hotel, and it is not a big one, was the bed was pretty hard, took a few days to get used to.

We like to walk the city so we actually walked from the hotel to Fisherman's Wharf on two occasions, and also to and from the Embarcadero, North Beach and locations in SOMA without much difficulty as long as you choose your hills carefully. The room was clean and quiet. We were on the back side of the hotel on an upper floor so we got very little street noise.

Union Square is centrally located and a great place to stay if you want to explore other areas of the city. I saw the many reviews on here and emailed the Chancellor's GM, Wes Tyler, to let him know we were celebrating my fiancee's graduation. He put us in a newly renovated room (see the pictures I've uploaded) and had a bottle of champagne waiting for us in the room when we arrived. The bed was luxurious, with plush covers - we found ourselves sneaking a daytime nap more than once. The room was light, very airy, cool (but not cold) during the day and night. Even though we were facing the main street (Powell), there was virtually no noise. The room had a large closet in it (room for suitcases, safe, and ironing board) which greatly helped. Service was excellent throughout and all the staff were friendly and accomodating - Miguel at the front desk really helped us late one night by printing out a bunch of paperwork and faxing it for us. A few tips for SF travellers in the Union Square area - the service at Lori's Diner a short distance away was terrible, avoid it if you can. Also, although Union Square itself is nice, if you walk too far in the wrong direction you can find yourself in a pretty shady area. Of course this is no reflection on the hotel, which is in a nice area. Chinatown is the perfect place to find tourist souvenirs for family and friends. You won't find better prices anywhere else, and Chinatown is five minutes away from the Chancellor. Once again, stay at the Chancellor.

Was a little disappointed that we were not told there was complimentaty choc chip cookies and apples and popcorn at the lobby. Guess we should have kept our eyes open. Didn't realise it until the last few moments when we were waiting for our shuttle in the lobby. Would have been nice if the front desk mentioned it to us upon our check in. Would have made our stay a lot more fun - to come back to this wonderful hotel and grab a cookie on the way up to our room :) But nevertheless, great hotel with a more-than-fair price. The so-called noise din't bother us at all.

Due to the late arrival and that we were travelling with an 18month old, we took a taxi straight to the hotel, which was probably the best option at that time. The taxi didn't have a car seat and we didn't travel with one, but it is up to the parent to choose to travel as such on vehicles like buses/trolleys/taxis. The taxi was a small SUV style and the driver was conscientious. The hotel staff was always professional and helpful. They were able to accomodate a small fridge for our son's food/milk even at the late hour of arrival (12:30am). We only ate at the hotel restaurant one morning but the food was good and the staff was very nice. Susan at the tour desk was always helpful with info and booked a Muir woods/Sausolito tour for us along with a rental car reservation for later in the week. The hotel location was excellent with the trolley being right outside. The rental car facility was about 3 blocks away. They picked us up at the hotel, but we returned from Napa Valley late, so I parked it in the garage above the rental facilty and walked back over in the morning to return the car. We enjoyed San Francisco very much. I recommend if you do the Muir/Sausolito tour and want to stay longer in Sausolito, just stay and take the ferry back to San Fran. In addition, we toured Napa and Sonoma and afterward drove straight west and came down the coast. This added a few hours to our return time, but if your not prone to car sickness it is definitely worth it. On our last day, we had a midnight flight out, so we left our luggage with the front desk for our last day of sightseeing. On our return to the hotel, we decided to take the BART to Oakland Airport even with our little one and 4 pieces of luggage. Matt at the front desk took the extra time to help us with our luggage to the station, which was a huge help, and we had a nice inexpensive trip to the airport on the BART and Air BART.

We were wrong. We were surprised and delighted by the Chancellor Hotel. We live in Mexico now, where we own a hotel ourselves. When we knew we were going back to San Francisco to visit family and friends of course we turned to tripadvisor, where we saw that the Chancellor had been named a Travelers Choice Best Bargain (like our own hotel!), so we booked it sight unseen. It was absolutely perfect. The location is great. Right in the heart of downtown San Francisco on Union Square, it is walking distance to plenty of fine shopping and restaurants. The Powell St. cable car line goes right by the front door of the hotel and will take you over to the Wharf area in a few minutes. Or, make the walk to either North Beach, Fisherman's Wharf or Chinatown--all are an invigorating walk and part of the fun of being in San Francisco. Our room overlooked the street with a view of Union Square. At night we would open the window and listen to a street musician\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s saxophone echoing through the Square accompanied by the occasional clang of cable car bells. The faint sounds of Disney music coming from the Disney store a couple of doors away also made us smile during the day. The slogan on the Chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comment card is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A three diamond hotel in a five star location.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Perfect description! San Francisco, as can sometimes happen, was in fine form the week we were there. As if to beckon us back home, it was absolutely seductive with sunny but breezy days and crisp nights. The comfort of the Chancellor really added to that experience. It made us very homesick for our City by the Bay! The Chancellor was built in 1914 and is a San Francisco classic. Rooms are small but very clean and comfortable with 40s/50\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s style furniture. Bathrooms are also small but modern. Each room we stayed in had a huge walk in closet, so despite the fact that the room was rather small, our luggage and clothing were completely out of the way in the large closet. There are great little touches like hair dryers, umbrellas (it is SF after all!), bath salts and powders, free dependable wireless internet and a pillow menu from which you can select from several types of pillows. When we checked in, we were even given a discount card for shopping at Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, which was a nice treat, since we had planned to do some shopping while in the States. In the lobby you will find free cookies, apples and coffee 24 hours a day. We only had the cookies once a day. Really. :) Even parking, which is always a headache in San Francisco, was made easy by the Chancellor. We had a rental car, and parking was a breeze at the garage just around the corner. Our room rate included the cost of parking there. We could have paid a few dollars extra for valet parking, but being from the City, driving and parking there is second nature to us, so we just parked & picked up our car ourselves. We stayed several days at the Chancellor and then left to visit family in Sacramento. When we returned to the hotel two days later we were treated like old friends and even given gift cards good at Luque\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant, enabling us to eat breakfast or lunch each day for the rest of our stay. As they said at the front desk, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We like to take care of our return guests.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (We did have breakfast at Luque\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one morning, and it was great. Even better than the one we had at the legendary Sears Fine Foods just next door.) On our last night we were up late packing, as we had to leave at a ridiculously early hour for the airport. As we were trying to guess if we were within the 50 pound limit for each of our bags, on a lark, we called the front desk to ask if they had a scale. They did!! They think of everything at the Chancellor. The staff was wonderful. From Kevin in reservations, to the front desk receptionists, to the people who brought pillows to the room on request, everyone was friendly and helpful. And the price was excellent. This hotel is truly a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Best Bargain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can probably find similar prices in modern box-like structures on the edges of the City. However, the Chancellor is a true San Francisco experience that allows you to be central to and part of one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greatest cities for a reasonable price.

It is charming with an intimate feeling, small enough to feel at home but right in the heart of The City, accessible to everything. The staff was friendly and welcoming, informative and efficient.

Ammenities such as comfortable beds, a pillow menu,ceiling fans, a walk in-closet with with a safe, a portable heater, iron and ironing board and an umbrella, plus ample room for hanging clothes as well as storing luggage . The bathroom had a soaking tub complete with bath salts and fine toiletries(as well a a rubber ducky!).There were sweets and coffee in the room as well as delicious Italian Roast coffee,cookies and apples in the lobby, along with free newspapers and WIFI computer access.

Upon arrival in the bright elegant lobby, the very pleasant and efficient check-in clerk welcomed us an assigned us a room on the seventh floor. Unfortunately when we arrived the door was open displaying electrical tools on the floor and cables which meant that someone was working on something in the room. We returned to the front desk where apologies flowed from the clerk and a new room was immediately assigned to us at the back of the building (blissfully quiet!) on the 2nd floor. The beds were very comfortable (single twins),l the room small but elegantly furnished and the bathroom also small spotless with a jet-flush toilet and a shower with superb water pressure. My friend immediately remarked the similarity of the Chancellor to the Algonquin Hotel in New York without the exorbitant cost (our rate was $92.75 a night) or the pretentious attitude. Little luxury touches abounded such as the free Wi-Fi for your laptop (there is also a terminal in the lobby for guests with a printer that's free to use) the jar of candies on the table, the excellent first rate bathroom toiletries,the safe in the closet,the ceiling fan, pay for play movies that literally were still on at the theatres when we were there(Dreamgirls,Children Of Men..etc), the pillow menu,the free coffee and tea and cookies and muffins (all wonderful if you are not a big breakfast person as we are not first thing in the a.m.) and a choice of free newspapers. All of the staff without exception were courteous,professional and knowledgeable. In fact the sign of a good hotel in my estimation, is one where you actually look forward to returning to at day's end earlier rather than later. The little bar in the lobby is a good place for an aperitif before going out for the evening and just as nice for one's morning coffee while poring over that day's paper. The location of the hotel is unbeatable. On Powell Street at Union Square, it is a five minute downhill walk to the Powell St Bart and Muni transit systems and to the terminus of the cable cars that everyone should travel at least once on. As we were there for three days we bought Muni Passports for $18.00 each and good for three days. Seeing that a single ride on a cable car is $5.00, we saved a bundle as we travelled the very user friendly transit system constantly. Also at Union Square is the half-price theatre ticket booth where we got tickets for Beach Blanket Babylon, the hysterically funny musical revue that is an institution in San Francisco. It is not to be missed! Restaurants abound in the area, however a lot of them seemed to be designed for tourists. We avoided them and had some wonderful meals off the beaten path but never more than a ten or twelve minute cable car or bus ride away. May I wholeheartedly suggest the laid back and casual North Beach Lobster Shack (532 Green St) where we had delectable Maine lobsters (two 1 & 1/4lb lobster dinners for $50.00), the amazing Swan Oyster Depot on Polk and California for lunch (not open for dinner) where the cracked crab, shrimp and oysters are the freshest anywhere and scrumptious (be prepared to line up as it only seats about twenty people at a counter but it is worth every minute of the wait), Brandy Ho's on Columbus for excellent and inexpensive Hunan style chinese cuisine (their dumplings are wonderful!) and The Zuni Cafe (another San Francisco gourmet institution) on Market and Gough for a high end smart casual lunch or dinner. They are famous for \"chicken for two\" which is roasted chicken with a bread salad dressing and which is jaw droppingly delectable.. A dinner for two with appetizers, main course and drinks and coffee (no dessert, as we were full) came to under $100.00.. Within an eight minute walk from the hotel, we also discovered a wonderful Indonesian restaurant on Post St, aptly named The Indonesia where everything we had was very delicious. We had a wonderful experience in one of our favorite cities and it was in no small part to the charm and comfort of the Chancellor.", "Date": "March 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location Great Value\u201d", "Author": "AdaptableAnn", "ReviewID": "UR7147425", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for three nights in March 2007 after reading reviews by others on Trip Advisor.

A few weeks before our trip, I emailed Wes Tyler, the General Manager, and told him we were coming for my wife's birthday and asked if we could have a room on one of the upper floors with a view of Union Square.

Got a package deal through Expedia and saved about the cost of one night's stay. The GM seemed quite responsive to questions and requests, so I thought I would drop him an email and find out for myself. I received a prompt response and got exactly what i requested (high floor room with a bit of a view, and breakfast recommendations). So many people have already said great things about this hotel, so I'll probably repeat a few here. This is what stood out for the hotel in my mind -- some stuff might seem minor to most, but it's little things we sometimes take for granted: -- Polite, attentive staff: Everyone always said 'hello'. -- Elevators: My wife doesn't like elevators that feel cramped and old. These ones got my wife's approval. And not only that, they were fast, and there were two. -- TV: Reception was perfect, and included HBO. The last two hotels we stayed at had issues, and it's always nice to watch a little television after a long day on your feet. -- Free coffee in the lobby: not only free, but always hot! I've stayed at hotels that offer free coffee, but don't keep it very warm after hours. -- Free newspaper: always a nice touch. -- Location: Maybe the most ideal location in Union Square if you really want to be picky: For example -- 12 minutes by foot to Moscone, 15 minutes by foot to House of Nanking in Chinatown, and neither involve a big uphill walk! If anyone is interested, our room (1403) was relatively quiet (the only thing you ever heard was the fire truck or police sirens), very spacious (for a boutique hotel), and had an OK view of the Square. What has been a bit of a tradition with my reviews is some tips that I could share that may help some fellow travellers: - Lori's Diner: Nothing special, but the food is priced well, especially since their website has a 20% off coupon. Google it and print a few for your trip. - Sushi joint: my favorite is Sanraku on Sutter. Sit at the bar, chat with the chefs, and watch'em work! - Chinese food: House of Nanking on Kearny. They rush the patrons a bit, but so what? The food is great and two people can leave with full tummies for $20. - Pub crawls: Thirsty Bear and 21st Ammendment are quite good. Try the watermelon wheat beer at the '21A'. The 21A is a bit of a walk from Union Square, but it is doable. Google for them both to check out the menus and exact locations. - Out-of-town excursions: If you are an Apple-fan, head south to Cupertino to see the Apple Campus. If not, head south to Palo Alto and have lunch at Stanford University. Free shuttle around the campus. We ate at Ciao! in the Terman Engineering Complex. Good food for a great price.

A few \"non hotel\" tips which other guests may find helpful- * Always book your Alcatraz trip in advance * If you are in town for any length of time buy a MUNI travel pass. * A matter of taste of course, but think it is better to stayhere rather than Fisherman's Wharf - more central for everything. * Suggestions for eating - \"Loris\" for breakfast which is just nearby. \"Mortons\" for steak-it is just around the corner. As a lot of other contributors have mentioned the main difference with this hotel - it is the \"customer service\" ethos of the staff, We found everyone helpful and friendly, especially the bar staff. I think this service level is epitomised by Wes Tyler himself. I contacted him prior to arrival as it was a special trip for my girl friend's 50th birthday. On arrival there was a gift in our room along with a voucher for the restaurant - how thoughtful. Wes also helped us with \"tourist information\" before our arrival. Fortunately we got the chance to meet him and thank him in person. I am sure if you let him have any requests before you arrive he will do his best to help. All in all we had a great time and delighted we consulted Trip Advisor and selected this hotel. We would say you definitely get what you pay for - and then some!! As a general point, I am very surprised that other hotels do not respond to customer feedback in the way the Chancellor does - it seems a strange omission to me in a service environment. Once again, thanks to Wes and his staff for a great stay in San Francisco.", "Date": "November 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockport UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "EricC01", "ReviewID": "UR6141335", "Content": "Having studied the reviews of the hotel on this site i was confident i would enjoy my stay at this hotel.

I have stayed in Fisherman's wharf and you somehow feel safer on union square as well as having more to do and see within walking distance of your hotel.

From the moment of our arrival the staff made us feel welcome. I'd e-mailed Wes Tyler the week before to ask for a room with a view and also mentioned it was our honeymoon. The room we were given on the 13th floor had a great view over Union Square and we were also provided with complimentary champagne and a Chancellor Hotel photo frame which was a nice touch. As other reviews have stated, the rooms are fairly small, however I've never understood why anybody needs a huge hotel room. I go on holiday to see places not stay in my room! The room was cleaned meticulously every day and had all the facilities we needed. The location of the hotel could not be better - accessibility to all the attractions is great due to the cable car stopping right outside the door and all the other MUNI links being accessible from the bottom of Powell Street. My only advice is that if you need a taxi I wouldn't ask the bell boy to hail you one. When we asked him, he told us that we basically had no chance at that time of day because all the taxi's coming down the street would go straight to the hotel opposite (where the bell boy had a whistle to flag down cabs). He did try though. Eventually he advised us to stand in line at one of the larger hotels a couple of blocks down the street as we'd be more likely to get a result. This should not be taken as a criticism in any way as I'm sure the larger hotel was much more expensive than the Chancellor and was able to employ someone to spend all day hailing cabs!! When I'm next in San Francisco I'll definitely stay at the Chancellor again. Why do I say that this hotel offers 5 star service?

I was very tired when we arrived and the first night I slept until 5 am when I was awakened by an irritating hummng noise but I didn't worry too much since it went away at about 6 am. However, the next night I was awakened in the early hours by the same noise and we got little sleep for the rest of the night.

Again it went away at 6 am. I would have asked for a room change but we were leaving that morning. At departure I mentioned our bad experience to the staff and they said they would certainly have given us a room change, but I am sure they were aware of the problem with that room. As for the rest of the hotel I can say that it was satisfactory: our room wasn't particularly small, and the decor was OK except for the carpet which had seen better days and which had some strange white marks on it as though someone had tried to clean it with bleach. There were no coffee making facilities in the room but coffee was freely available in the lobby. The location of the hotel was wonderful. My only other gripe is that about a month before our stay I tried to book a room online using the hotel website but I was told that there were none available but because of the reviews the hotel receives on Tripadvisor I persisted and I obtained a room through an agent but this may have increased the cost - the Chancellor was the most expensive hotel on my recent visit to California.

We just got back from out trip and spent 3 nights at the Chancellor 9-14-06 to 9-17-06. Everyone on the list was right that Union Square is the best area to be in. We visited Fishermans Wharf but way way too crowded. This was our first trip to San Francisco and we are so happy that we went with the Chancellor. All the reviews were wonderful and Wes Tyler is the best General Manager I have ever worked with. Unfortunately we did not get to meet Wes in person though I feel like I know him already from this list. He is always so helpful and never pushes the Chacellor. If someone seems to want something different he will recommend other places. That impressed me. When we first pulled up to the Chancellor I thought this area is really old I hope I didn't make a mistake. Even though it is very old, it is so unique and does not look old inside or smell old like some places do. It is very clean, very elegant but in its own way. The rooms are smaller but not that small. We had a bed (which I slept great in which is unusual for me - the buckwheat pillow I picked from the menu helped!! I'm buying a couple for home). We had the usual dresser, desk, tv, side tables, 2 chairs and a table by the window. We also were able to put 2 of those fold up suitcase holders in 2 corners of the room for our suitcase. So to be able to do that it can't be that small. He put a couple nice extra's in there for us plus their usual amenities, jar full of hard candy, umbrella (thankfully we did not need it), iron, ironing board, safe, qtips, cotton balls, shampoo, lotion, bath salts, and shower cap. Also a pillow menu and menu with massagers too if you want to use for a small fee. The bathtub is unreal. You can be on one end and try your hardest and you cannot touch the other end. It is that long. And deep.....I was trying to fill it up but after half hour finally gave up and took my bath,,,,,I think in a half hour I did not even get it half full. Yep that is how deep it is. We asked for a back room so it would be quiet. Well it was not totally quiet but that was a good thing. We went to sleep with the faint sound of a jazz horn playing. HOW COOL IS THAT?? I wish I were bak there now....it seems so long ago, not just a week. My big worry was air conditioning...I am an air conditioning addict and was so afraid it would get hot and stuffy. Was I surprised. Its nice to have the window open and small breeze, no bugs or anything to worry about there. But at night it actually got so cold we had to close the window and turn the paddle fan off. Believe me I was most surprised by that. Though the streets and muni system did confuse us a bit, I do think that the Chancellor is a good central location. We could walk 2 blocks over and 2 blocks up to Chinatown,,,that was fun. Everyone working at the Chancellor is extra nice . You can tell it iis not just a job but that they really take pride in working there and its as if they are welcoming you into their home. I will always highly recommend the Chancellor to anyone going to San Francisco. I'll put a trip report on the San Francisco Forum within a week or so. Oh how can I forget the most important!

I booked with the Chancellor primarily because of the reviews on Trip Advisor, and I wasn't disappointed. This is a great hotel. I requested a room with lots of light and a view if possible, and I received it. The staff was incredibly helpful and the food (I only had breakfast) in the restaurant was very good. As for the room (I was in 1003), it was on the small side. For one person it was quite comfortable but probably not what you are looking for if you want a romantic getaway. I loved the bathroom with the huge soaking tub and the window that looked out onto the fire escape. There was wonderful natural light in the bathroom which is something you won't find at other hotels. I could picture Sam Spade crawling out the bathroom window and escaping down the fire escape when the person he was investigating arrived back at his room. There was a big window in the room which i always left open a bit. You could definitely hear the street noise, but I got used to it quickly and it created a feeling that i was really in the city. The flashing pink sign from the starlight dance hall across the street softly flashed through the window at night. Someone might find that irritating, but I found it charming and it didn't interfere with my sleep. The free wireless worked perfectly for me. The bed was very comfortable. The closet was spacious, but the drawers on the chest under the TV did stick , and I figured out I couldn't close them all the way. The staff were all sweet, solicitous, and polite. I was only there for a few days but they recognized me and treated me with familiarity. The lady selling the tours I would call the \"Tour Nazi.\" She's very intimidating, but I think she is an independent contractor with the hotel. HOWEVER, the assistance she did give me was right on target and just what I needed. Just be prepared for her firm, no-nonsense manner. Unfortunately, I had to cut my stay short in San Francisco and at the hotel. I had to check out earlier than planned. I gave the front desk the appropriate notice, and they didn't blink an eye about it or give me any grief. I could go on and on about the hotel. I would definitely stay there again.

Shops, bars and restaurants are all on the doorstep, and Sears Fine Foods is next door. This is a perfect place for breakfast or brunch. - The price is very competitive. - Free tea and coffee is a bonus although once I had to wait for fifteen minutes when the bellboy went and restocked all three flasks. Cookies are very tasty. This service may only be available because there are no facilities in the rooms. - The free Internet is great and the two times I used it I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to queue. Note there is only one PC for guests to use. - The reception staff were friendly and helpful. However, there are a few things that all potential guests should be aware of: - The bedrooms are described as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcEuropean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcboutique\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.

We then just used the stairs and still had time to pour ourselves a coffee before the lift finally made it to the lobby! - Our room was not spotlessly clean as so many guests state. In fact, it was not clean at all. The skirting boards were filthy, as was the whole content of the walk-in wardrobe. My photo shows just how dusty the tissue holder in the bathroom was. It must have taken months of not being cleaned to get into this state. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m writing this fully aware that Wes will write a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmanagement response\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 saying that had I made him aware of dirt and grime problem during my stay it would have been sorted out, but room cleanliness is vastly different from reporting a faulty lock or broken light bulb.

Our first issue was stopping the car and it was difficult given the tight streets with the cable car tracks right in the middle. We had to do a big loop in order to drive up facing the right direction, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just San Francisco. Stopping in front of the hotel for the valet parking was difficult when we arrived in the evening since the whole block was full of parked cars despite it being a no parking zone. Eventually, we got the valet to take my car to their undisclosed parking location. Be aware that you need to give 20 minutes notice to get your car back. There was a mix-up one time when I asked for my car and they somehow brought the wrong one. But the error was corrected quickly and the staff was friendly. The valet parking cost seems like a lot but considering the price of the rooms and the nature of driving in San Francisco, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite reasonable. The room was a touch on the small side, but given the location and history of the building, it was a minor concern. We were provided with a spacious closet that included a safe which was a nice touch. The bathroom was fine and the little touches made it feel cozier (like the rubber duckie and the not-often-provided cotton swabs). Watch the lip walking into the bathroom though because you might trip or at least hurt your toes. Another nice touch to the room was the pillow menu. We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be bothered to ask for different pillows, but knowing that they had a varied selection of interesting pillows was comforting. The Chancellor had one computer in the lobby for public internet use. The set-up seemed like the computer was off-limits, but all you have to do is ask to use it. The room is set up for wireless internet access, but you need your own laptop of course. One really helpful thing was the map they provided. It had all of the major tourist attractions and really made it easier for us to plan our trip. All in all, we were quite comfortable at the Chancellor and the staff was very friendly (including answering our questions about the 4.0 earthquake that happened while we were in San Fran).

Well we were back within 10 minutes and our car had already been sent to the valet parking garage, apparantly there was a miscommunication amoungst the staff. It only set us back 15-20 minutes, but it was frustrating and we didn't feel like the staff was very apologetic about it. That was made worse by the valet driver visibly showing his disappointment at the lack of a tip...I didn't feel like tipping when my car shouldn't have been taken to begin with..call me crazy. The valet driver doesn't work for the hotel, so I didn't hold that against them, but it was tacky. Other than that incident, I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful.

The room was comfortable and clean. Amenities were above and beyond what you find in some of the larger \"chain\" hotels. The deep tub w/bath salts--and the rubber ducky--made for a nice extra after a long day of walking up and down (and up and down... and up and down) the steep hills. The hotel is in a very convenient location for taking public transportation, making it very easy to get around. If walking is your thing (it isn't really mine) the hotel is close enough to everything that you can walk easily. You can grab a trolley car in front of the hotel, or easily grab a cab (we used both the Muni system and took cabs---both were effective from this hotel). The staff was very friendly and helpful. We made tour arrangements in the lobby and that was great. Susan was very helpful. The tour company picked us up at the hotel in the morning and dropped us back off at the end of the day. Very convenient. The bar is small and cozy and is a great way to either start or end your evening. Alicia, the bartender, was very helpful and gave us dining and sight-seeing tips. It was nice to be able to visit with other guests in the bar area. I would also like to thank Wes Tyler. I e-mailed him prior to our trip and told him it was our anniversary and asked if we could possibly have a room with a view. We arrived to find ourselves on the 15th floor with a view of the water and of Union Square. If that wasn't enough, on the day of our anniversary, we returned to the room to find a nice little surprise waiting for us. We appreciated (and enjoyed) the sentiment very much.

Now i'm a fairly young guy- mid twenties, but I'm pretty picky. After booking the hotel I was expecting a good location, clean and efficient rooms and a decent bathroom, not much else. But after staying there this past weekend with my girlfriend, I was really impressed on how much they've kept their standards high. We had a romantic time, even had a view, and the room has EVERYTHING you need. Safe, extra towels, extra covers, MP3 player, etc. . . The rooms aren't huge, but they aren't tiny either. European is a good word for it, but the spacing is just right for two people and the beds were comfy. (I've lived in Europe for a few years so I can say that). Location is great, right across from Francis Drake Hotel which has a cool bar with a view in it, and right near the trams. Almost everything is accesible. Plus the staff were very helpful, even when one dude at the front desk had lost his voice completely the poor guy still strained his throat to tell me (very quietly but politely) good dinner spots on the map.

Most reviews were right on the money and this hotel is the best bang for your dollar. Clean rooms with a great location and a staff that is so helpful. Matthew gave us suggestions for two restaurants that were reasonable and had very good food. L'ottavo (Italian food) on Sutter St. just a few blocks from the hotel. Foleys (Irish Pub) on O'Farrell only a few blocks from the hotel. We also got a 3 day Muni pass for $18.00 for the Trolleys and public transportation. This was great because we would hop on and hop off all day as we saw all the sights. At the Chancellor you can pick up the Trolley just a few doors away. We also had fun renting a tandem bike from Saddles down at the Wharf. We took the bike path along the bay and up and across the Golden Gate Bridge and back again. If we had to do it over again we would have continued down to Sausilito after we crossed the bridge (as this is all down hill) and then take a ferry back to the Wharf. Just a reminder that the seats on these bikes are small so your butt is going to be sore during and after the ride. The bar at the Chancellor is small so you can talk to other guests and locals and share their experiences both good and bad. One couple told us how wonderful Muir Woods was but their tour didn't give them enough time there ( a little over and hr) . The tour would have cost us $44.00 per person so we rented a car at Thrify on O'Farrell for $29.95 per day. When we got there they also gave us an upgrade for the same price. We hiked for 3 1/2 hrs early in the morning and had a calm wonderful morning among the huge trees. We then drove up to Sonoma (wine country) then down to Sausilito.

We stayed 2 nights (May 11- May 13) before flying back to boring England (nobody ever left their heart there). There was a mix-up involving our pick-up from the Cruise Terminal which was quickly resolved. A compensatory bottle of wine was waiting for us in our room. We thought this was rather generous - unneccessary but very kind all the same. The breakfast component of the bread and breakfast package (and I don't believe this was made clear on the website) was worth $14 (as is now clearly stated on the Summer Value Package). This, in contrast, we thought was rather cheap as $7 per person wouldn't buy much at all (three quarters of a blueberry omelette, I think). After a quick chat with the front desk, this was upgraded to $28 which is sufficient for two people to indulge in one of their four (very tasty) breakfast packages (e.g. juice, tea/coffee, toast, vegetable omelette) valued at $12-13 approx. So my only suggestion to the management is to do likewise - change your current and future packages from a $14 per room restaurant allowance to (a more realistic) $28.

Parking is close by and works well (you drop off your car in the parking garage and it's parked for you). I have to say that I researched various places quite carefully prior to booking at the Chancellor (actually I spent about two hours looking at various places, with a wide range in price). What tipped the balance in favour of the Chancellor is that the general manager has taken the time to actually respond to comments on this web site: I felt that the service and general level of attention would be better than elsewhere, given that he is obviously concerned about how his hotel is perceived.

After discovering tripadvisor we chose the Chancellor Hotel and couldn't be happier that we did. It is right in the heart of everything... shopping, cable cars, near Chinatown, the financial district, the Ferry building and a short ride to Fisherman's Wharf and Ghirardelli Sq. There are great restaurants within walking distance (Millenium - vegetarian; Mela - Indian;) which the front desk staff recommended. Prior to our visit, I e-mailed the hotel and asked for a room with a 'view' since my bf was celebrating his birthday and we wanted a nice view of the city). Upon check-in, Mr. Tyler, the hotel mgr. had a bottle of sparkling wine waiting for us in our room. What a great touch! You rarely find such courteous and thoughtful people these days. It's the small things people take note of and this hotel does these quite well: the pillow choice, the complimentary coffee and tea in the lobby, cookies and apples for snacks with the coffee and tea. You just don't find these types of amenities anywhere anymore. Not once did we run into any hotel staff (even those cleaning rooms on the floors) that they didn't greet us with a warm friendly hello. The rooms are pretty much as described by others on here and on the hotel website. This is an older hotel but very well maintained and probably the BEST value for the location. We typically don't spend a lot of time IN a hotel room when we travel... it's a place to sleep and rest before heading back out to see the sights. Cleanliness is what we value most and this is the one thing that we found the Chancellor to do VERY well. We didn't notice that the rooms or the bathrooms were all that small. There is a BIG closet and a safe in each room. We do quite a bit of travelling and this room (for an older \"boutique\" hotel) is quite nice... and an AWESOME value for the location. We had the valet parking package which is a good value. It takes about 20 minutes to retrieve your car, so calling down to the front desk in advance is recommended. The only thing I would say that needs updating is the bedspreads -- as they are quite worn and outdated. However, we will be back for another trip and WILL stay a the Chancellor again. It is rare to find hotel that seems to do the little things to make your visit enjoyable AND memorable. As far as other recommendations -- buy your tickets in advance for Alcatraz. We didn't and they were sold out... next time! beachblanketbabylon.com is a riot. If you haven't seen it -- go! A day trip North or South is well worth it. Our trip to Sausalito was very nice. Be sure to stop at the last exit heading south on 101 before the bridge for some awesome views and pics of the Golden Gate Bridge...drive all the way up to the top of the mountain and climb up to Hawk's Hill. Simply stunning scenery. Walking around the Castro district was a lot of fun and there were plenty of nice bars and restaurants. We would highly recommend Thai Express... great food and value.

Taxi fare to and from SFO international was about $40 including the tip. As for visitor tips - there's one I would definately recommend. Buy a MUNI Passport ticket to cover your stay. If you're in town for 5 days buy a 7 day ticket, believe me you'll save money!! Example: 2 people making 2 return trips on a cable car in one day would cost $40 ($5 each single trip); buy a 1 day MUNI Passport for $11 each and that covers your trips plus you can use it on buses and the tramcar along Market St. Wish I got one on our 1st day !! This would only apply to overseas visitors but one thing that we thought was a bit annoying upon check out was that our credit card was already charged before we had agreed the bill. This meant that a refund of a service back to our card was made in US dollars which the card company make a charge for to convert back to your currency, so if they inadvertantly charge for something you didnt use or buy then you are out of pocket anyway.

We live about an hour away and came into town for a party in the city and didn't want to drive home. Here are my general thoughts - both good and bad. The Good 1. Kudos to management for coming here and reading and responding to the comments on this site. I think that says a lot for the management and, regardless of what else I say here, they are to be commended. 2. The Chancellor is in a great location in San Francisco and is a good value for the money. The bed was comfortable and the room, while somewhat small, was clean and fine for our purposes. 3. The staff was very friendly and professional. The Bad 1. There is nothing management can do about this, but be advised that the bathrooms are really small. They have a deep tub, which *is* a nice touch, but there is really only room for one person in the bathroom at a time. The pictures posted on this site are accurate. 2. In the case of the rooms facing Union Square, the lack of air conditioning was a real issue for us. Granted this is San Francisco, and it rarely gets ridiculously hot, but here is the dillemna: We were on the 13th floor facing the street. More quiet than the lower floors I would imagine, but there is still plenty of street noise. So you can keep the window closed, but then the room gets really, really stuffy and the ceiling fan just doesn't do enough to rectify that problem. You COULD open the window, but it is on the fire escape so there is a potential stranger access / safety issue that is not unreasonable in a major city. There *is* a little bolt to hold it closed, but it is not big enough to allow any real air in the room. EVEN if you did either the full open window or the small latched opening, it would be useless as you would have to open up the blinds to let the air in...and there is a huge Harry Denton's Starlight Lounge neon sign directly opposite the higher floors and flashing outside all night long. So you have to choose between stuffiness (which is made worse by the smallness of the room/shower and the warmth of that filling up the room) and the neon light flashing in your room all night long. My wife and I both woke up due to the warm stuffiness in the room several times throughout the night. There it is...warts and all. I think that the Chancellor is a good value hotel in a great location with a good staff and responsive management and would recommend it with the caveats listed above.

A year ago, I visited with some friends from out of the country and we thought the Chancellor was a great hotel, but the beds were too hard for our comfort. San Francisco is a tough city to find quality hotels for a reasonable price, so after pouring through hundreds of reviews for the competition and being disappointed with what I found, I came back to Tripadvisor and checked out many reviews here for the Chancellor. I noticed that the hotel manager, Wes, responded to many of these reviews and even said not to hesitate contacting him if there was any problem, so I did! Wes immediately emailed me back that the hotel can fit any of the beds with a soft \"cell-foam\" covering that would make them more comfortable and went out of his way to make sure that I was happy with everything. I would have to say that the Chancellor is truly outstanding because the people there make the difference. From the efficient and friendly check-in, helpful tourist advice, restaurant recommendations (such as the fantastic Inidan restaurant \"Mela,\" only blocks away from the hotel), the staff made me feel very welcome during my stay. On top of this, there was a complimentary selection of coffee, tea, cookies and apples in the lobby along with plenty of newspapers to read! The room was immaculate, nicely decorated and they even offered a selection of something like 8 different types of pillows at no extra charge. I would just caution anyone staying in adjoining rooms (two rooms that are joined by double doors), to know your neighbors. One of my friends was supposed to be staying in the adjoining room to mine for 4 nights, but he cancelled 2 nights due to other committments and I could hear conversation, coughs and sneezes from the other room at times that I normally wouldn't have been awake! The adjoining rooms would probably be great for families with kids, but if you want a really quiet room, I would recommend asking for one that is by itself. Overall, the value, quality, location and service just can't be beat. I would stay at the Chancellor again in a heartbeat! I have stayed at several SF hotels in the same price range where the staff seemed to consider their guests annoyances, the heat didn't work and nobody could fix it, the furnishings were badly worn, etc. I'm confident that the Chancellor will meet expectations of a quality hotel at a reasonable price, and that if it doesn't, management will do most anything in its power to make things right!", "Date": "October 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo, Brazil", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Stay!!! =)\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3992701", "Content": "Me and my mother would recommend this hotel... we spend 10 days ate the Chancellor.

This hotel was certainly a bargain. We were able to get it pretty cheap from Priceline. I always wonder if we get our hotel from such a website, does that indicate we will get a bad room? We were on the top floor with no view. We saw the backs of builiding and ugly rooftops. Because we would be out of the hotel 90% of the time, I didn't mind. The front desk staff was very nice. The door man helped us with our bags and was very courteous. The hotel doesn't need A/C. It was freezing in the middle of July and the fan does a fine job cooling you down. With the windows open, however, you do hear garbage trucks and a lot of noise from the city (trolleys gear up around 6 or 7 am). We stopped downstairs to try to figure out how to get a trolley pass and we quickly found the reservation desk. The woman behind the reservation desk was unreal. I have never experienced such behavior. She was taking a personal call while we were standing in front of her. She actually put her hand over the phone and asked us what we needed, gave us a short answer and then went back to talking on the phone. It was something you would see in a sitcom. My husband got out money for a trolley pass and he stood there with the money out for over a minute while we listened to her telephone conversation. So, we didn't get the great treatment that it appears other reviewers received. The trolleys were always full and after buying a 3-day pass to use them, we were very upset that we ended up walking the majority of the time. We found out later that if we would have walked 2 blocks we would be picked up without a problem (this is something the reservation desk should have told us) Parking is around $30.00 plus tax a day, which is another expenditure you will need to budget in. We also had a problem with someone trying to get into our room around midnight on our second night.

Like New York, where I am from, it is a city that is meant to be walked (the hills are not that bad). There is also so much to do and see. If you are a tourist stay away from Fisherman's Warf, it is so stale. The only locals there are the people who work there. It's a tourist trap and it is very sad to see in a city that has so much to offer. EXPLORE. Anyways, my stay at the Chancellor Hotel was really great. It was clean, quite affordable (especially in 2003), and conveniently located for a first time visitor. I was on a bit of a budget so was unable to rent a car but did not need one. I relied on public transportation and also explored alot of the city by foot. The public transportation is great during the day and evening, but late at night it seems to stop. I remember one night after going to a club waiting for one of the electric trolleys on Market Street. I waited....and waited, someone else showed up who was also waiting. I thought that this seemed promising as I found it unlikely that he would also be a tourist so the trolley should be here soon. Time continued to pass and I decided to ask him how frequent the trains run late at night, it turned out that he too was from New York (our public transportation runs 24/7 so we were both accustomed to this). Soon a car pulled up and one of the passengers asked what we were doing, they gave us the impression that the trolley was not coming and since I had not seen any taxis and my fellow New Yorker was going in the same direction I asked if we could have a ride. They let us and I was brought back to the Chancellor. Back to the Chancellor, I stayed there about a week and a half and did not spend much time in the hotel aside from the first day when I had a bit of jet lag. My only complaint would be that the linens and towels seemed a bit worn, not dirty, but worn. The room seemed large to me, but I live in New York where apartments are small and I was staying by myself. The furnishings and decor are nothing out of the ordinary and very modest. It looked like a hotel. The staff was friendly and seemed aproachable if you had questions. Again, the Location could not be better for a first time visitor. I would definitely recommend it to a friend so I suggest that you consider staying here. Also, if you are looking for some inexpensive, interesting entertainment when visiting, head to the Audium. It is located not far away from the Chancellor. A friend had told me about it and said that I had to go. She was right! It is run by this older couple and was started in maybe the 60's or 70's. It is basically an electronic musical performance. The listening room has speakers embeded in the ceiling and floor so the sound envelops you. It is basically old-fashioned surround sound and is really alot of fun. Visit ---- for more information.

The street cars which will take you all the way down to China Town, Little Italy and the south side of the esplanade (down by Ghiradelli Square) stopped right outside the hotel.

The cable car stops right in front of the hotel which is very convenient. The hotel has a travel desk which is awesome because it helps you plan your days to get the most of your experience. We were there from late Wednesday night until Sunday afternoon and we saw a lot of San Francisco thanks to the planning help. They helped us to arrange a bus tour of the city (picked us up at the door) and a bus tour of wine country. Both were reasonable and well worth the money. They also helped us figure out the public transportation and then we were really free to explore the city. We were in a great location - very close to many attractions and restaurants. We had drinks at the bar a couple of times. The bar is VERY small but friendly and actually surprisingly lively on the weekend nights. We had breakfast in the restaurant (good) but didn't eat meals there. (WAY too many great restaurants in the city to eat at a hotel!) We paid $79 a night for our room and considering the hotel prices in SF we thought we got a bargain. We look forward to staying there again.

The staff were friendly and the room was clean and comfortable. The lady at the tour desk was very helpful with booking day trips. We picked the Grey Line city tour combined with the Alcatraz trip ***** and a day trip to Monterey and Carmel also *****. The drivers on these trips are amazing, their knowledge of the area is boundless and they never stop talking. One restaurant worth a mention is Sears right next door to the Chancellor, people queuing to get in is always a good sign, but time it right and you will get straight in. We had breakfast and dinner at Sears and would recommend both. Cable cars are great fun but if you can manage the hills try walking it is amazing the little treasures you come across on foot. We would definitely recommend the Chancellor to anyone on a budget; it offered every thing it promised. The only disappointment we found, and it was my fault really for not checking, was that there is no in room tea and coffee making facilities. The hotel does provide 24hour self serve tea and coffee free of charge in the foyer but this requires someone to go down and fetch it.

I was lucky to read the revies beforehand and book this hotel. The location could not be better as it's said here. The standard room was also big enough for a couple. Maybe because there was big closet for your luggage and clothes. I read from other reviews that tho bathroom would be cold, but I didn't realise that it would be freezing! It was really cold in there and we had to keep the floor covered with towels that we could stand in there. There is no heating in the bathroom at all. I wrote to the hotel beforehand and asked for a view to Unions Square and also a room from upper floors. We got what we asked for. Our room was in the 12th floor and we had the view we asked for. I also asked beforehand if I could book a car through the hotel or if they had any special deals with any car rental companies, but the answer was simply no. So I booked a car from AVIS, but I was quite suprised when I arrived to the hotel and found a big sign on the concierges desk which said \"Dollar car available here\"... Otherwise the service at the desk was fine. We even got a late checking out when we asked for that. The room was kept clean all the time. Well, as clean as one can keep that kind of mattress. The maid also kept our candy cup filled all the time. Only problem with a service was in the restaurant. One mornig we decided to try hotel's breakfast, but didn't do it again. We were in a bit of a hurry to catch a bus and asked the waiter to hurry up. He said no problem. There was only three more couples having breakfast (and two waiters) so it wasn't too much to asked for. We got our breakfast (beside the toasts) and I immediately asked the waiter to bring the check when he could. After 10 minutes we hadn't got our toasts yet (and hadn't got the waiter) and one supervisor (I think) walked by and I asked her for the toasts and she replied that the waiters were only trainees, so it could take a while. So, she did absolutely nothing about that. After 15-20 minutes we had finished our brakfast besides those toasts and finally got our waiter, but no toasts and no check. He didn't apologise when I mentioned about the missing toasts and asked again for the check. He only left for them. Soon we got toast and the check, but we didn't have time to eat the bread anymore. As for the brakfast itself, don't bother. For that price you don't have to chew those reheated bacons, but you can go and que to the next door at Sears Fine Food and you'll get a fabulous breakfast! It's really worth to wait 10 minutes in a que. Or maybe you can go to Lorrie's next block, which is good too. Because so many have told all the good sides of this hotel I'm not going to repeat them.

I could not quite believe that the price quoted was so reasonable (including parking too!!) for a hotel in such a prime location. However, reading all the posts here gave me the confidence to go ahead and book - I'm really glad I did and a big \"thank you\" to everyone who has taken the time to add a review to this site - even the ones where people had issues, it's all useful info. The hotel is great, excellent value, excellent location, fantastic staff. The room, a corner room at the front on the 12th floor, was certainly large enough for 2, as was the bathroom. Everyone raves about how clean the rooms are, and they are kept immaculately clean. Did not get a chance to try the restaurant (which is open for breakfast and lunch) but did sample the coffee and cookies in the lobby - a really nice touch. I think the best bit for me was the staff. Everyone I met took such a pride in their hotel and the part they played in making it the great place it is. What struck me most was how friendly staff members were - without being over familiar or cheeky, it made me as a first time visitor feel like a frequent and valued guest. The manager often states in his replies to negative posts that the hotel is 90 years old and makes no excuses for that. It does show, I have to say, in some areas but I think in quite a nice way - if you are looking for long, wide, spacious corridors on every floor, then look elsewhere, but anyone expecting a 5 star experience should also expect to pay the 5 star price (and probably still not have such an enjoyable stay after all!!) ((reading this again before posting, I've stayed at some so called 5 star hotels that were far worse in several areas than The Chancellor)) The hotel is clean, smart, welcoming, efficient and very comfortable. We were only there for a few nights (wish it could have been longer) but during that time we wanted for nothing - everything you could possibly need in a hotel room was there - bathroom items (including the rubber duckie - I don't quite get that one, but it obviously means a lot to some people!!!!!) phone, TV, extra pillows, umbrella in case it rains (it didn't, but I know it often does!!), coffee, cookies, laundry, safe, wireless Internet (free!!!!!) - I could go on, but if you got this far you probably don't want me to!! I think that this being a family run hotel says a lot - they have seen what works in other hotels and learnt from that, and we the guests get the benefit. The manager says that all the staff read these reviews, so this is a chance to say \"Thank You!\" to everyone.

My hubby walked through the door of our room on the ninth floor before I did and said, \"Wow, you ordered champagne!\" I hadn't ordered it. However, I had mentioned our celebration as I was making our reservations. This was a most thoughtful gesture on the part of the hotel.

The rooms were on the smallish side by contemporary standards, but sufficient for two people. Everyone else has mentioned the coffee and cookies, and I agree they were tasty -- especially the cherry-chocolate ones. The staff -- from the front desk, to bartender, to housekeeping -- was always friendly and courteous. One of the elevators was fixed and opened while we were there, but the other was then closed for repairs. The new one is speedy and quiet -- works great. One bartender, Ty, encouraged conversation and it was through him that we met a young couple travelling from England. We ended up spending a day with them when we rented a car to drive to Napa (with help from the service desk at the hotel) -- a day that passed much too quickly.

It's CHEAP, but you wouldn't think so with the service they provide! The location is out of this world...right on Union Square, on Powell Street (so you can easily get a cable car to Fishermans Wharf) and within walking distance (15-20 mins max) of places like the Moscone Convention Center south of Market. The room was perfectly sized for me - I can't understand why people were saying it was too small, but maybe it would be a stretch with 2 people staying, I don't know. Nice touches included the jar of sweets and the rubber duck - a coffee machine would have been great, if only to wake me up in the morning (as the bed was too comfortable!), but that's only a minor issue as there was coffee available in the reception area. It was also really quiet - despite being in a busy area, I never really had a problem sleeping, and it was certainly in a safe location. Thanks also go to the lady on the Tour Desk, who I probably annoyed too much with my requests for bus tours, sweets, drinks, transfers to the airport etc...but she carried out these requests with no fuss at all. Problems? Nothing major, and certainly nothing to reduce the review by 5 stars to 4. I think most have commented on the fact only one lift works - although on the 11th floor, I never found this a problem at all (no more than 5 minutes waiting), and while I was there, it was clear that everything was being done to accomodate this (e.g. notifying residents), so I can't really call this a problem. However, I did once try to walk to the 11th floor (of 14, I think) and, even as a fit(ish) 20-something, I was really tired by the time I got to the top! Also, room service in the evening was only provided Wed - Sat: I would have liked this to have been provided on other nights, as (travelling alone) I found it really awkward walking into restaurants and asking for a \"table for one\"...however, there were PLENTY of local restaurants only steps away from the hotel, so I guess it's a business decision - I normally ate my food at the bar, and it didn't appear that the service was over-subscribed, so I guess most people would prefer to eat out at a local restaurant instead. Finally, I wouldn't really book here if you're a smoker (the hotel is completely non-smoking), or if you're looking for a party atmosphere (e.g. a stag night/bachelor party) - go to a cookie-cutter hotel for that!

It wasn't, BUT, this is where this hotel's sincere hospitality we've all been reading about started. The young girl at the desk was very apologetic to us about the room not being available, but she actually called Housekeeping to see when it would be ready. They gave her an approximate time for our exact room and she offered to hold our luggage. She recommended a couple of things to do in and around Union Square to pass the time and should check back later, all this time calling me by my last name. Within 2 hours, we came back (still waaay before the 3 o'clock hour) and happily said our room was ready. It's a great way to start a vacation. No complaints whatsoever with the room. 14th floor, overlooking Union Square. Elevator wait, no problem. No air conditioner, no problem. Not the right pillow we wanted, no problem. Great towels, great closet, the ceiling fan a great touch. The window fully opened letting us take the views and the sounds all in. We took advantage of the free cookies, coffee, apples, and candy (in the room). We befriended the lady behind the Tour Desk. I think her name was Susan. Despite what was previously said about her in a another post, she was genuinely friendly. She reminded us of \"Edna\", respectfully, in the movie The Incredibles. :-) She was full of recommendations and answered our questions before we even asked. This is where you buy the 3 day or 1 day Passport for the Cable cars, MUNI buses, or trolleys. GREAT value. She has the usual Cokes, bottles of water, aspirin, etc. for sale. You can also buy tour tickets from her as well. We did eat at the restaurant there. Luques (?) I think was the name. It was Sunday morning we ate breakfast there. Good, fast, a little on the high $ide, but nonetheless worth it. The location of this hotel, as said before, is unbeatable.

Did not get response back from housekeeping or follow up by the desk clerk. Around 3:00 I ask yet another desk clerk when will the room be ready. She did give me a discount on the room as it was not ready on time, but at that point the money was not an issue - I just wanted a room, any room, as my granddaughter was feeling worse. Time passes ............ we finally get a room around after 3:30. But the keys do not work. Housekeeping has to open the door for us, but now my granddaughter is upset and starting to cry, I am upset, so we go down to the lobby and say we are not staying, we are leaving. The desk clerk says \"you are welcome to leave, but you must pay for the room\". Needless to say, we are all upset at this time, and there is no talking to the deskclerk. So, we leave the hotel, and go home. We never stayed, we were in the room at most 30 seconds, we are upset due to the management staff, and yet we must pay for a room that we did not use.

All I can say about those rare \"unhappy\" traveller reviews is that they must only like cookie cutter chain hotel rooms! The Chancellor is a piece of Europe in the heart of San Francisco. Clean, outstanding location, wonderful staff, ambience, and affordable! We brought another couple from Florida as a surprise for his birthday. Unknown to me, the staff put a chilled bottle of very good private-label wine in their room with a congratulatory card. A really CLASS touch! They have traveled extensively and were very happy with the Chancellor. Everything about this hotel is good old fashioned guest service -- thick, monogrammed towels, genuinely helpful and friendly staff, jar of candy in the room, fresh apples and cookies in the lobby, rubber \"duckies\" in the bathroom for your bath(!), and even an umbrella in the closet should the weather require! The rooms are on the small side, but that is typical of a hotel built 100 years ago (pay attention here all you people who want 1000 sq. ft. rooms!!!). Nonetheless, it was very adequate for two people and CLEAN. The elevator service was slow because they are renovating, and 1 of 2 were offline. But we still never had to wait more than 4 or 5 minutes. I have waited that long in big hotels with whole banks of elevators. It is well worth paying a few dollars extra for the valet parking! I think the only thing that did not impress me was the bartender on duty that night in the lobby bar. He was very lethargic and lacked the enthusiastic personality the rest of the staff exhibits. Maybe he was having a bad night. If not, they need to replace him or give him some Dale Carnegie lessons! If you are a light sleeper you'll want a higher level room -- lots of city noises including the cable cars. And don't forget to review their \"menu\" of pillow options!

The Hotel is located right downtown and I used nearby public transport easily - cable cars, buses and the BART system. I also walked around the city and surrounding areas heaps and found so many attractions within walking distance - Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf, Lombard St. Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul and many other tourist landmarks. I also walked to the Theatre on Green Street one night which was only a fifteen minute walk. I could easily have jumped on a cable car and been there in 5 minutes if I wanted but I really loved walking around taking in all the sights and sounds and smells. What a magical city! The Hotel was what I expected in a good way although the room was a little smaller than anticipated, but not tiny. If you ask to stay on a higher level you'll get a great view of the city or Union Square and as I was high up I opened the window at times just to hear the 'ting ting ting' of the cable cars. I love a good bath so the oversized bathtub was wonderful, especially after a long day sightseeing. Little extra touches like the complimentary 'help yourself' hot beverages, cookies and apples were greatly appreciated. The cookies were seriously some of the best I've ever tasted! Found the staff not particularly friendly or rude, just kind of 'neutral' which I think could be a point of improvement. They were efficient though which is important and when I requested a bar fridge for my room they had one there within 5 minutes. Also have to say the lady on the Tour Desk went out of her way to help me with information and directions and other such things so thanks to her! Many comments about the lift have already been written but I have to say it does make things a little inconvenient especially if you're staying on a higher floor. Seems this project has been ongoing for some time and before I stay there again I'd be keen to know when it will be rectified.

Its best feature: no locked-out hotel workers striking in front of it to harass you and other guests! (I sympathize with the workers, but they sure made SF look bad.) You cannot beat this hotel for location and price, given the rates of other Union Square lodging choices. It really is right on the street car line and is within walking distance of China Town, MoMA, etc. I don't know that I would stay at The Chancellor in the summer (no a/c and we never could figure out how to open the windows so it may be impossible), but for autumnal afternoon temperatures in the 60's and evening lows in the 50's, it was just fine. Ventilation in the bathroom was poor, but given the hotel's age, I was not surprised. It was clean and tidy, even if the room was small; there was enough space for us and our luggage. My only real complaint is that it would be nice to have some color in the room - we had whitewash everywhere with the furniture & carpet providing the only relief (I don't count the 2 tiny prints on the wall, nor do I count the wallpaper border in the bath). Our view over Powell Street was fine. The staff was nice, although the Asian woman at the information desk in the lobby was probably the least enthusiastic person I have ever met in my life. Someone wake this lady up! Thanks to the reviewer who recommended Sears Fine Food in a review on this site - we ate breakfast there and it is GREAT.

The hotel is old and the rooms are small (especially the bathroom), but it was more than adequate for our stay. Our room was clean and comfortable with a king size bed, overlooking Powell Street. The bells of the cable cars lulled us to sleep at night! The Union Square location was incredible. We were within walking distance to some world class shopping and plenty of restaurants in all categories. We purchased a 3 day Muni pass ($15), which I highly recommend, and we were able to take advantage of San Francisco's incredible public transportation system including the cable cars. We took advantage of the pillow menu and each ordered specialty pillows. There is no air conditioning here so I wouldn't want to stay in the hot weather, but the ceiling fan was fine in November. Also, because of the size of the rooms, I wouldn't suggest staying with a family.

If you need to sleep in a room that is 100% quiet without any street noise, you are not going to find it here. If you are used to staying at a 5-star, this is NOT the place for you! My wife and I just returned from a five night/six day trip to San Francisco (part vacation and part work ... for me at least!). We arrived early Tuesday morning (11/02/2004) and took the BART to Market/Powell station. Cost is only $4.95 per person. This is cheap in comparison to a shuttle for $12.50 or a taxi for approximately $40 plus tip. The trip was about 30-45 minutes long. Upon exiting the station, we needed to walk 4 blocks up a slight hill to get to the hotel. We arrived at approximately 9:00AM and proceeded to check in. We were told that the specific room that we had requested (queen with a view of Union Square) was not available yet, but we were offered the option of getting a room that was available immediately. Now tell me, when was the last time you arrived at a hotel that early and was offered an immediate check in? We decline and stored out luggage and proceeded to sightsee. The location of the Hotel is on Powell between Post and Sutter. The cable car stop is located right outside the hotel, with the start point at Market and Powell. The cable car is fun to ride but access to different parts of SF are limited. Also, at $3 per person, the Muni system at $1.25 with at least a 90-minute transfer is really the way to travel around the city. Unless you are used to the stress of driving in a very congested city, don't even think about using a car around town (more about this later). Several Muni bus stops are located not more than 2 blocks from the hotel. After doing some sightseeing, we checked into our room at about 2:00pm. I must say, that ALL the employees of the hotel were extremely nice and friendly and willing to answer any questions and help in most any way. We should know, because we were constantly asking about transportation, eating and questions in general. We wound up in a corner room (1003), located around the corner from the elevators and the ice machine at the far end of the hall. On one side there was another room (we did not hear anything next door for the entire time we were there) and opposite was the emergency exit to the fire escape. We overlooked Powell and were able to see Union Square from our window. The first thing that my wife and I did was race to the bathroom to see if we had a rubber duckie waiting for us and sure enough, there it was! The bathroom was on the small side, with the toilet such that opening and closing the door while seated would be difficult. The tub, however, was a large and deep cast iron one. Since neither my wife nor myself planned on spending any significant time in this room, we were able to easily overlook any shortcomings. The room itself was much larger than I had imagined based upon the reviews that I had read. I was expecting a room slightly larger than a cabin on a cruise ship! We had a queen bed, a desk and chair and a table at the window with 2 additional chairs. Yes, it is true that there isn't any air conditioning (just a ceiling fan), but at this time of year, none was needed. And yes, the carpet was a bit warn, but it was clean and I didn't plan on doing anything other than walk on it. We did happen to get a glimpse of another room, and it did appear to be somewhat smaller than ours. I guess the corner room might offer a little more space. Although there was only a 3-draw dresser to store clothes, the closet in the room was a walk in! Plenty of room to hang stuff and store unneeded luggage. Also, it contained extra pillows, blankets and an umbrella, not to mention a digital security safe. The Pillow Menu is for real! My wife and I tried a number of different pillows during our stay. Our favorite was the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Between the Knees\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pillow. We also asked for and received a noise machine. We kept our window all the time. We were able to hear noise from the street, but mostly during the day and somewhat at night (cable car, occasional car horn, and crowds). I guess it was heightened by the fact that many hotel workers were on strike and you could somewhat hear their chants. Bottom line, though, was that I was so exhausted by the time we came back to the room, that we both slept like rocks (the beds are comfortable and very, very clean). I actually booked my hotel stay on Travelocity. The daily rates provided by Travelocity were better than those that I received directly from the hotel ($99 TWTh, $125 F, $145 Sat). Travelocity even gave me a FREE night ($89 TWTh, Free Fri, $125 Sat). My 5-night stay was approximately $455 with taxes and fees. The hotel also has either on-sight valet or off-sight self-parking for an additional fee (I think for an additional daily fee of $30 and $20, respectively). You can come and go as often as you like. Travelocity, however, offered the on-sight valet parking for only an additional $18 per night. This beats the average going rate of $25, and that usually does not allow unlimited in and out). The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apple bowl is always full and on occasion even cookies are available at no charge. The apples were a great snack to hold us over until our meals. We did not try either room service or the hotel restaurant. The following is additional information for those that are interested. We rented a car for one day to travel outside the city. We went to Monterey and visited the aquarium (awesome!) and we took the 17-Mile drive in Carmel (wonderful views). The car rental place is located 3 blocks from the hotel (220 O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Farrell). There was Alamo, National and Budget. I reserved using Orbitz (where I usually find the best rates) and got a Saturday daily rate of $30 (the weekday rates ranged between $26 and $28) for a compact. At the rental place, they offered us a convertible (Sebring) for an additional $10. It was just what we needed for a sunny drive. The drive was about 120 miles and took 2 hours. Since the rental place was closed by the time we returned Saturday night, we needed to park the car until the morning. The parking lot on the corner where we rented from charged only $12.50 for the late night special (in by 7:30PM out by 9:30AM). Very cheap! As I said before, I would not use a car to get around in the city. Our stress level went from zero to 10 when we returned on Saturday night. Driving in an unfamiliar city at night is hard, to say the least. Then you have to deal with the wacky street directions, which do not permit left-hand turns across traffic on many streets. When we were only about 5 blocks from the parking lot, it took us literally 45 minutes to get there, making a lot of right hand turns! China Town is located a few short blocks away. And above that is Little Italy. We had the best rotisserie chicken and pasta at Gira Polli, located at Union and Stockton. Not only was the food good and reasonably priced, but the staff was friendly and the owner Noreen spent almost 30 minutes talking with us after we had paid our bill! Also at that location, on Stockton, you will find a great Italian bakery (??) and an extremely good gelato place (Sue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fruits?). There is also a magnificent church to visit diagonally across the street. For pizza, try Golden Boy. Pretty good (compared to NYC)! Since we live in a land locked state, it is always a treat for us to get fresh fish. Personally, my wife and I no longer go out to eat fish where we live. For the same amount of money, we splurge and get our seafood from Whole Foods (where we know that it has not been previously frozen) and cook it at home. Same amount of money spent, but it all went into the price of the fish! We ate sushi at a nearby restaurant (2 blocks from the hotel) on the corner of Sutter and Mason. Sushi is at it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best when it is made with fresh fish! Now, for the most part, Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Warf is a tourist trap. We did, however, go with some locals to Scoma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, which is rated as one of the best seafood restaurants in SF. Plan on spending about $50 per person, but well worth every cent! You haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been to SF unless you have had Dim Sum! Probably the best Dim Sum restaurant is Yang Sing (2 locations). Plan on approximately $20-$25 per person, again, worth every cent for the food and experience! We also ate at a great french resturant called Le Centrale, located just opposite the gates to China town. Finally, the museums --- Most are free the first Tuesday or Wednesday of the month. Some others are free one day a week. The Legion of Honor (near the Presidio) is a great museum for those that are into paintings and sculpture. They have a very large collection of Renaissance artists and one of the largest collections of Rodan sculptures. The Exporatorium located between Golden Gate Park and the Presidio is an excellent hands on museum. My wife and I had a blast there! While in the area, there is really great Teih and Vietnamese food (real hole in the wall authentic!). We also went to Alcatraz. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure if this was going to be cheesy, but it turned out to be a very informative trip. The National Park Service runs it. We spent about 3 hours (including the ferry). Cost is $16 per person (including ferry and audio). Unfortunately we did not have nearly enough time to see many of the other museums that SF has to offer. Our only bad experience was at the very end of our trip. We took a taxi to the airport (SFO). The fare should have been between $36 and $40. Our driver told us that 101 was backed up with an estimated time of 1-1/2 hours. He took us around the horn (I-280) for an ultimate fare of $52. I do not really think that highway 101 had any traffic early Sunday afternoon. I guess when they ask where you are from, the response should always be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153from here.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Overall, a fantastic trip.

I used trip advisor as a guide in picking out a hotel, still I was not sure I made the right decision... Once I got to Chancellor I knew immediately that I made a great decision. First the location is unbelievable, in the heart of Union Square where the best shopping is with the fanciest stores anyone can imagine, close to the best public transportation in the US. I am from Chicago and I thought we have good public transportation but that was until I got to SF and I used MUNI absolutely everywhere from one end of the town to the other, great connection with minimum wait, get MUNI pass it's also good for the cable car which happen to have a stop right in front of the hotel. Chancellor Hotel... friendly staff with a great sense of humor, rarely found anywhere else. To check in took exactly 2 minutes, I guess they also know what they are doing...:) Elevators, every entry that mentioned the elevators were saying they are slow, let me tell you the elevators are fine, true it's not like the Devil's drop at Great America but they work just fine, and you know what if you think these are slow evators than go to Europe and I would love to hear one's opinion than. Europe's elevator have the speed of a snail race, that is if the elevator works at all. The rooms... When I opened the door I expected to enter this room a bit bigger than a closet, considering everyone mentioned how small the rooms are, Well... the rooms are perfect, actally I was a little surprised to see that was not small at all. From the room we had a great view of the union square. The beds were so comfortable and sooooooo clean. I am a very picky person who ALWAYS checks every layer of the bed sheets making sure it's clean and no surprises. I was surprised but this time it was because beds were so white, crisp, clean NO funny smell... Bathroom, again very, very clean, very well stocked, even Q-tips, and yes the ruber ducky was there waiting for us, nice touch. In the lobby, 24 hours hot coffe, tea, fresh homemade cookies, yummmm and fresh apples... Great way to start your day with. Overall I have to say I was very satisfyied with my stay at the Chancellor. Next time in San Francisco, I can guarantee I will be checking in at the Chancellor.

With that said, this hotel is as clean and quiet if not cleaner and a more quiet hotel than that of the larger more expensive hotel chains found elsewhere. Rooms are smallish but at this price do what we did, get two adjoining rooms. Room for all !! Great rest - beds are clean and comfortable - at a very good price. Great Location. Can walk around as its a safe area - a few beggars perhaps, but this is a large American city not unlike any other large American city in that regard. Easy acess to cable cars, taxis and BART - no need for a car while in the City. Fun tip : Rent the \"Blazing Saddle\" bikes and ride across the GG Bridge. Yolanda the desk person ( who assisted with our extra nights stay ) and Matt the Bellman ( who secured me an extra rubber duck) were names I recall for service. I can't recall anyone else at any other hotel I've stayed at over the past year. Can you? It's that kind of place.", "Date": "June 26, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redding, Ca", "Title": "\u201cThe Chancellor: I only wish I could have stayed longer!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2220023", "Content": "I stayed at the Chancellor after reveiwing tons of hotels on this site. I was not disappointed. I did book directly through the hotels website though, and would recommend that as the price was better than any other site. I paid 89 for my night, 101 after the taxes. That was an excellent deal for the place as my 13th floor room overlooked Union Square. Some other reviewers complained about noise, but the only problem I had was when my neighbors had their television up a little loud. With the window closed, I couldn't even really hear the street noise. I am a great lover of SF, so the cable car bell was actually charming to me. I found the decor to be tasteful. They avoided that crappy fake border/stencil stuff that many other hotels try to pass off as decorating. The room was impeccably clean, with opening windows, a ceiling fan which cut any warmth and black out curtains that made the room almost pitch black in the middle of the day if one so desired. There was also a deep tub that I took full advantage of. Others have complained about the size of the room, but for one or two people, it was quite comfortable. Besides, you're in the city, why stay in the room if you don't have to!? The hotel staff was excellent and friendly. I was able to check in a full 2 hours early after a quick email to the hotel site. The service, even just on their website, was prompt and courteous. They held my luggage after checkout because I had a couple of hours to kill before leaving. There are a bounty of shops, restaurants and entertainment within easy walking distance and the public transportation is almost ridiculously easy to use. If you need a refrigerator in your room, request it ahead of time because mine didn't come with one. That is really my only complaint. I just wish I could have stayed longer. I loved the Chancellor and would recommend it to anyone.

Another tip, yes, there is a trolley stop in front of the hotel. The problem with the Trolleys is that they are usually full.
