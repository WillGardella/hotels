Since it was business I did not want to deal with noisy casinos or a 45 min walk through the lobby to get to my room. This is why this location interested me. PROS: Off the strip, not a lot of traffic, laundry room, pool, gym, clean rooms, nice staff, free breakfast, free parking, close to airport and rental return center, and close to Town Square mall (lots of places to eat at the mall) CONS: Airplane, train, and semi-truck noise and thin walls. My sleep was interrupted by the noise and the crying baby in the next room to me. I hold no fault to the crying baby, just wished the walls were not so thin. I could hear my neighbors sneeze. Because of the noise I will most likely not stay here again. If you're a heavy sleeper looking for a good deal off the strip, you might enjoy this location. Also, they have a free shuttle that goes to a couple of casinos on the strip. They also have a free shuttle to take you to the airport, but not pick up.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anderson, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cPretty good stay for business travel\u201d", "Author": "Jeff J", "ReviewID": "UR126746128", "Content": "This is my second business trip to Las Vegas and my second stay at the same hotel. Obviously there was nothing wrong last year so I cam back but some of my plans did not work out. I was rather disappointed to learn upon arrival that my room (called a \"king suite\" at check in) did not have a refrigerator in the room. I am in town for a trade show and had planned to pack some food each day to avoid the over priced, lousy trade show food for lunch. So I have a lunch bag and no place to keep any lunch food cold. I was also surprised to find no vending or ice machines on the third floor. Oh well, that's what the convenient store across the street and an expense account are for. The workout room is fine and the treadmill works well with no squeaking or excessive noise. The lobby is nice and the great room for breakfast is huge compared to some other Holiday Inn Express properties. I have not tried the pool yet but did bring my suit. It's too cold right now with highs only in the 60 degree range so maybe next year. The rooms are clean, the beds comfy and all in all the hotel is nice and quiet, easy parking and none of the traffic from the strip.

On one of the days we were there, we had booked ourselves a full day trip to the Grand Canyon and had to leave at about 6.15 am. The breakfasts at the Holiday Inn Express\u2019 are always wonderful but it doesn\u2019t start that early, and so we asked a Manager at the hotel if we could take-away our breakfast (even before they officially open) and in typical Holiday Inn Express spirit, the hotel were kind enough to oblige which helped us a lot as we just needed a bit of a bite to eat \u2013 especially the children \u2013 before hopping onto the bus our day long trip! In terms of the hotel\u2019s location, the Holiday Inn Express at Las Vegas South was just off The Strip which was just nice for our family as we didn\u2019t really want to be too close to the lights and noise emitting from The Strip itself. The convenient free shuttle service from the hotel leaving every half hour and every hour-on-the-hour basis from the hotel to different points on the Las Vegas Strip was a great plus. That allowed us to have our own free time and then hop back to the hotel anytime we liked. It took us just 5 minutes by shuttle to the nearest drop off point at The Strip and that saved us quite a bit in terms of transport to and fro. The Holiday Inn Express at Las Vegas South is just right if you want to be just a bit away from The Strip itself but not too far away. I\u2019d recommend the Holiday Inn Express at Las Vegas South if you\u2019re going with a family and children in tow \u2013 it\u2019s a cozy hotel with friendly staff and that\u2019s just want anyone would want for their holidays!", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Off Strip Hotel\u201d", "Author": "SmilingHospitality", "ReviewID": "UR122501263", "Content": "I stayed at this Holiday Inn Express back in December and have to say that it was fantastic!

It's a favoritre for several reasons: I'm picky about price, noise, cleanliness, staff quality and closeness to attractions and places to to eat outside the hotel. This place satisfies all of those requirements. It's a small hotel, located in the same parking lot as two other major chain hotels. The hotels are priced about the same to stay competitive, and offer similar amenities. It's also close to the interstate, but, because of location it doesn't capture any of the highway noise and there is no Strip traffic to get caught in. It's also close to several restaurants, convenience stores, pharmacies and gas stations, one being just across the street. If you fly into town, it's about 3 miles from McCarren airport and the hotel also provides a shuttle service. This is a Holiday Inn Express, so it doesn't boast any kind of room service or restaurant on property. However, a decent breakfast, beyond donuts and coffe was offered in the eating area off the lobby. The rooms are pretty spacious for an Express Hotel. No issues with water pressure, bugs, etc. No activities for children as this is not a full service hotel, but there was a pool and recreation room. My child enjoyed the pool and the staff was very helpful in providing coloring books and such to keep him occupied while we were eating breakfast. There is a small fridge in the room which is helpful as well. The bed in our Queen room was comfortable which is super important to me. The room itself was a good size and we had no problem setting our 1 year ild up with his Pack 'N' Play and toys. The price of the room is between $69 and $99/night and this hasn't seemed to change in the last 4 years. the property overall has been maintained very well and offers a great alternative to Strip hotels with the convenience of being just 5 minutes away from the Strip. You can still be near the action, but when you're ready to leave it, you can be done with it and enjoy a quiet evening! Property is half a mile from the Mandalay Bay Hotel, so you can drive and park your car, then take the shuttle/monorail up and down the Strip.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Israel", "Title": "\u201cNot as expected\u201d", "Author": "yairlin", "ReviewID": "UR120475100", "Content": "We stayed at Holiday Inn Express South in October 2011 for just one night although we booked for three.

The main problem was the airplanes take-off nois every two minutes. The walls and windows are definitely not noise proof. It was almost impossible to sleep that night and at 6 AM it start again. The good thing was that we could cancel the other two nights without cancelation fee. The hotel itself is under the standard in compare to other Holiday Inn Express hotels, and we have usually very good experience with this hotel brand.

We reached the hotel late evening from the airport and were welcomed by Brian at the front Desk. Our names were displayed at the front desk board as GUESTS OF THE DAY and we were given a bag of goodies and an upgrade to a top floor 'strip facing' room. This was a great begining. ROOM: A spacious room with a seating area, nice fragrance, did not look tired, crisp white bed linen. We were given a microwave and a refrigerator. I believe it is usually available on request.The rooms have a Wi-Fi free of cost. The lobby has a PC which gives free access to internet limited to 15 minutes per user. BREAKFAST: Is served on the ground floor opposite the front desk and has a good spread of cereals, toast, boiled/scrambled eggs,bacon, juices, tea/coffee, toast, bagels ets. Good enough to start your day.The hotel does not have any restaurant serving lunch or dinner. Recommend eating the buffet at Ceasars and MGM Grand though. LOCATION : Is a 5 minute drive to the strip, the hotel has a shuttle to MGM and Mandalay Bay every 30/60 minutes. The drivers are most helpful and informative. On request they can drop you at the Town Center a great place to spend an evening with kids. We did not rent a car and on the Strip itself you can hire taxis. The Hotel shuttle will also drop you to the Vegas airport but inform them in advance. This property is for families mainly who can enjoy the Strip during the day/evenings with the glitz and noise and come back to the tranquility of a good night's sleep in this hotel. If gambling is the main agenda then this place does not have a casino so it will not fit your needs. LAUNDRY: There is a laundry room on the 2nd Floor, with coin operated washing machine and dryers. The front desk can give you the quarters for operating the machines and you could also buy the washing powder from them. $ 1 for a wash and $ 1 for drying. We liked this a lot sicne we were staying for 4 nights. Freshly washed clothes.! PARKING: I believe is free, we did not have a car though.

Or perhaps a pure rate play. The hotel is often $10-20 less than its counterparts at the I-15/Russell Road exit, so it's a relative bargain at face value. However, once you get inside the hotel, you can easily see where corners are cut and capital expense hoarded to allow for that shaving of rate. The lobby, entry, hallways and rooms are as if time had stopped around 1995 - dark green carpets, often worn and dirty; scuff marks along all walls and room doors; pillows that needed to be replaced a couple of years ago; worn linens and towels; a hulking tube-style TV sitting on top of a dresser. The hotel is simply tired. So is the service. At check-in, I was greeted with a mass-copied \"letter\" stating that the HIE pool \"is not currently heated\" and that I was welcome to use any of the heated pools at the neighbors - the Staybridge Suites, Fairfield Inn and Courtyard share this plot of land. Upon entry to the room I got ready for bed, hunkered down, reached for the remote - and couldn't find it. I called down and was first told that I could come down and get a replacement, then reluctantly told that they would bring one up. 20 minutes later, I had to get dressed and trudge down to get a remote and was met with \"Oh, sorry. Here.\" There are a few bright spots, although none rise to the level of delight to make this a \"high value\" choice. Room AC units are as powerful and ice-cold as I've ever seen, especially in Las Vegas. The HIE breakfast is stocked well and kept clean for the entire length of the shift. Beds are comfortable and the room itself is clean with no major issues. Water pressure is fantastic and the HIE signature shower head pumps it out well.Blackout drapes do a better job of actually blacking out the room than in most hotels in this price range. As long as I'm generally not bothered and they can clean the room, I can stay here for the 3 nights of my stay. Next time, however, I'll consider other options. That's the danger of trying to manage a hotel at the edge of the value proposition - you'll slip over that edge and lose future guests and never know it.

Anyway, the next day the staff moved us to a room with a safe and functioning sofa bed (room 218 for info), and from then on we had no problems at all. The breakfast was standard HI Express fare, and coffee was available most of the day in the lobby. Laundry facilities (powder was provided for us), ice, vending for cokes, etc no problem.

The pool and hot tub were very nice, and the times I used the pool there were hardly any other people ever there. They had outdoor showers and private bathrooms right by the pool which was very convenient. The hotel sits near many main roadways, but I never heard a single noise from the roads. If you get a room facing the front of the hotel, you will also get a wonderful view of the strip! Quite a view at night time. The hotel does offer complimentary shuttles to Mandalay bay but they only happen every hour and stop around 11PM. There also is a free shuttle to the airport that departs every hour which was very convenient. Breakfast was standard HI express fare, and they always had delicious cookies out for guests during the day and evening. The staff was extremely helpful as well with directions and advice.

I have to say, that was above and beyond what we expected. The rooms are spotless, as said in other reviews and I am really fussy. The walls are really thin though. I heard in detail (through the wall) from some guys in the next room, all about their \"show\" experience. I am glad that they didn't wake my daughter up! However, someone must have complained about the noise, as the staff were up quite promptly to sort out the problem. The pool is quite and clean and there is a safe relaxed atmosphere there. I see this as being a hotel for families with younger kids staying in Vegas and people on business. Our family would definitely stay again, but if my husband and I were in Vegas without our daughter, we would stay on the strip. The shuttle bus they put on there is great, but if we were there to gamble, I enjoy being able to easily walk back up to our room without the hassle of buses and taxies. We all definitely give this place a big thumbs up!", "Date": "August 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toluca Lake,CA", "Title": "\u201cVery overrated, taxi rides will cost you a fortune!\u201d", "Author": "bingopajama1", "ReviewID": "UR8208184", "Content": "Stayed at the Mandalay Bay mdiweek until it got to expensive and booked this on Hotwire at $92.00, after seeing it had the 7th best customer satisfaction rating. First off, the person checking us in insisted on putting my 18 year old daughter and I in a king size bed with me because \"that was what Hotwire had us down for. She did not seem to understand that there was something quite wrong with that. After going over her head and having the great vibe of our vacation taken away, we managed to get two double beds. This hotel is fine for someone resting their weary head on a business trip, however it is not suitable for a vacation style hotel. The pool lacks any charm and the area is \"devegetated\". For a few more bucks I would strongly suggest booking a better hotel. This hotel is in the middle of nowhere and any savings on the room will be eaten alive by taxi rides. I have been to Vegas over 100 times and this place is truly near the bottom.

We had a rental car and parked for free at the hotels. Very easy in/out parking at hotels. Did notice that the buses on the Strip were always crowded, even on Mon./Tue. This is a VERY clean and newer hotel. I am very particular about a hotel being clean. I even look at caulking lines around toilet to make sure they are clean. Coffee maker and tea bags in room, along with blow dryer and ironing board. Bedding was great. You have a choice of firm or soft pillows. No frig or microwave(would have been nice). No ice machine on 2nd floor(which we were on). Did not hear any outside noise(not even the planes), but the floors are very thin. People above us came in around 3:45 AM and sounded like they opening and closing their dresser drawers over and over again and just walking around for about an hour. Even the A/C couldn't hum that out. Would get top floor next time. Lobby area was very clean, front office staff very friendly(Brian) and helpful. Good variety for breakfast. Entrance of hotel had a great variety of coupons and magazines with coupons. Someone earlier mentioned the neighborhood was shady around hotel. I did not find that to be the case at all. Not much to really do withing walking distance from hotel. But who needs that when you have the Strip. This hotel is closest to the bottom 1/2 of the Strip. Spent 2 days here and only completed 1/2 hotels on the Strip. Hotels are farther apart than they seem on the maps. Was there on a Monday and Tuesday and did not notice the lines to be long at all. Was still pretty busy during the night even though it was during the week. Was worred about all I've heard about people standing on the side of the street handing out mini flyers of 1/2 dressed women(they did that but were not pushy at all), but not one tried to hand them to us since we had small kids with us. Had the buffet at Terrible's and it lived up to it's name.

Perfectly adequate free breakfast. We asked for a room overlooking the strip on a high floor (about 1 mile away) as suggested by a previous reviewer. These are to the front of the hotel and we were surprised as to how close the strip seemed (great pictures taken at night) but without the incessant noise and hustle and bustle. Be warned however, there is a building plot directly in front of the hotel and once built on will obliterate this view completely. Building works next door but no noise heard at all.

I wanted somewhere off strip so that the noise and madness was optional, and that's exactly what we got! I'd echo all the positive comments below about comfort, cleanliness, value etc and there's not much more i can add on that front. we stayed here two nights, then did a driving tour of California, then back to Vegas for two nights on the Strip, so can compare both options. In summary, i'd suggest this place is perfect for independent minded people who want to experience Vegas without the inconveniences of the big Strip hotels - lines for everything, hit and miss service, etc. Oh, and who don't mind at least one person not drinking at dinner so they can drive back, tho a cab is only $10 or so from the near end of the strip, and the HI do provide a shuttle bus option too. I heard no airplane noise either. Really don't know what's going on with that, unless the flight path changes based on wind direction or something. A few particular positives about this hotel, and i guess being off strip in general: - no long traffic queue to get to the hotel, no long walk from the car park, and no lines to check in. We could have been in our rooms within 10 minutes of picking up the rental car. - it's quiet - no drunken groups in the hallways at night, or shrieking cleaners in the hallways in the morning! - breakfast included - and by UK standards, a large and thorough breakfast! yes you might want to go pig out at a buffet afterwards, but it's nice to have the option of at least a quick coffee / snack first if you want a slower start to the day. - POOL & hot tub were a big plus because there was never anyone in them! You'll never get any part of the pool to yourself in one of the big hotels. And, it was open until midnight if you fancied a dip before bed, which i love. Strip hotels tend to close their pools quite early, i guess to stop drunk people falling in them or something, i don't know!

Parking was close and convenient and no lines at the front desk for check in. Sure, it's not on the strip, but only a short drive takes you there. We did not use the free shuttle to the Mandalay.

After having thoroughly read all the reviews for this hotel, I decided it sounded like a good deal to me. We were able to book this room with 25000 Priority Club points per night. We found the hotel very easy to get to from the car rental station at the airport. The whole hotel smells clean and fresh, and the beds here among the finest I have ever had at any hotel. Although the hotel is very airport handy, and others have written here complaining of airplane noise hindering their sleep, I can say that I never heard a plane fly over the entire 3 days we have been here. The Air conditioning units have a fan setting that allows you keep the fan running constantly ( heat or air) and that must act as white noise to cover the noise from the airport very well. The AC is a window type unit, but it is controlled by a thermostat on the wall. Always a plus staying at any HI Express is free continental breakfast and free in room wireless hi speed internet. Breakfast is identical of course to any HI Express. I am in room 324, and the view from my room includes several hotels on the strip ( from the backside) including the Bellagio. (My view also includes the interstate, so don't think I am saying it's just like staying on the strip!) We are in an \"executive\" room, which does have a small refrigerator and microwave and coffee maker, along with a sofa sleeper and coffee table. This the last night of my 3 night stay here, and I have slept like a baby the last two nights. The front desk staff has been very helpful in offering information about the hotel and the area, the shuttle to Mandalay Bay, and back routes to strip hotels during rush hour.
