However, the hotel met our needs for what we wanted it to do. It was centrally located, near several restaurants, easy to get to, and appeared to be in a fair part of town. The breakfasts had a good selection except that they ran out of stuff a couple of days. I realize that can happen, but it seems like you would anticipate this when the hotel is full and \"stock up\". The nights were relatively quiet. The front desk staff was helpful. John (at the front desk) was particularly helpful and friendly.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vero Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel with excellent staff!\u201d", "Author": "soccercrazy4", "ReviewID": "UR125025548", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 nights in a 2QB suite (extended room with couch). The room had a medium size frig (not one of those tiny cubes!), microwave, and room for food storage. The room was quite spacious. The beds were new, but too soft for my taste - although my daughter loved them! We requested a room on the top floor away from the elevator & ice machine AND they were more than accomodating! We interacted with more than 5 front desk staff and ALL were extremely nice and helpful. The breakfast is hot with a very nice selection for the whole family. The hotel itself is off a quiet street, but adjacent to I-17. I was worried at first, but the windows seemed soundproof and we did not hear any of the interstate traffic noise. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area. It's a great bargin!!

Loved the indoor pool, especially since an outdoor pool would have been too hot in August.

I was very happy to get a AAA rate for less than $60.00 per night (this is the \"low\" season in Phoenix). The staff were very friendly and helpful. I was very pleased when I was able to check in just before noon on the day I arrived. I have some trouble walking/standing for long periods of time, so I requested a handicap accessible room. It was perfect-the large bathroom and walk-in shower were wonderful! There was also an abundance of nice toiletries and lots of towels! The beds were a bit high but very comfortable with lots of pillows! The room also had a microwave and mini-refrigerator which was greatly appreciated! There was also a safe and iron/ironing board, and coffee maker with lots of coffee. The AC worked great and was adjustable (very important in Phoenix in August!) There was also a computer for guests' use in the lobby, as well as fruit, coffee and newspapers. I loved the complimentary breakfast. It included hot foods (eggs, bacon, sausage), as well as bagels, English muffins and pastries. There are two waffle makers, as well as several kinds of cereal and beverages to choose from. I wasn't too concerned with the location since I was with family and friends during the day; I just wanted to be around the Metro Center area. Just across the parking lot there is a Sweet Tomatoes restaurant (yummy!) and it looked like there were a few other restaurants fairly close to the hotel, including an Outback Steak House. The hotel is located right off of I-17, although the entrance is a couple of blocks off of the freeway. My room was located near the freeway side, but I could barely hear the traffic; it didn't bother me at all. I had a very pleasant experience here and would definitely stay here again!", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Torrance", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to stay!!

Sure, we could lie and say we only have 4, but I'm a bad liar. So this Comfort Suites deserves some credit for even having a room that can handle my group. Moreover, the price was decent. We paid $113 a night for a 2 bedroom (and 1 sofa pull out). So the price is decent. Families need to be aware that the hotel is in a neighborhood with a lot of street activity. And by street activity, I mean there are shady people roaming the streets at all hours. There was a near constant police presence. This is in no way the hotel's fault, and their security was great. But corners are cut. At check-in we asked to extend our stay a night and night clerk told us we would have to wait until in the morning because she didn't know how to do it. The biggest disappointment was the pull out bed in the sofa. Night One: NO SHEETS in the room for it. Asked the clerk for some the next day. Night two: NO SHEETS.

This might be an acceptable practice in the hotel business - greedy to make their buck at the expense of their customers. It is however the worst level of service a hotel can demonstrate. Imagine inviting friends or family over to your house, and then upon their arrival on your porch you ask them to spend the night at the neighbors. It's just rude.
