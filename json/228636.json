The hotel was a good walk from the town, but iot was not unpleasant strolling along by the sea. The main reason for our trip was to spend some time in Barcelona, but the highlight was a visit to the Monastery at Monserrat, a spectacular drive up and the most wonderful views on reaching the topWe only took breakfast in the hotel, and as a Mas member we had 2 for the price of 1, but the range of food on offer meant we could eat enough to get us through most of the day.

This was our second stay and we were not disappointed. The location of the hotel is fantastic and our rooms were nicely appointment with a great sea view. It is a short walk to Sitges centre or a very quick taxi ride. However, make the most of the quiet beaches and good restaurants within 5-mins walking distance from the hotel.This hotel definitely gets busier at the weekends with many spanish tourists coming for a weekend break, however, it was never too uncomfortable. For me the hotel is let down slightly by minor irritations. Although breakfast is superb, other meals are very poor. The snack bar food is terrible and even getting a decent lunch is hard. This is surprising considering how many brilliant restaurants there are in the area. This needs to be improved. Another irritation is the lack of UK TV channels. Clearly, one doesn't go to Sitges to watch TV all day but to catch one or two movies over 9 days would have been good. There are no UK channels other than CNN and no movie ordering service. The hotel would clearly make some money introducing this service.All in all though, an excellent choice for Sitges and we will definitely return.", "Date": "Aug 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR407466692", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "rebsed"}, {"Content": "Great Location, Wonderful Town Just returned from 10 great days in Sitges at the Melia Sitges.

The hotel property was very nice, yet some things should be updated in the rooms. The part that bothered me the most was that the air conditioning barely worked. We would have switched rooms, but we had just switched rooms a few minutes earlier because there was a sewage smell coming out of the bathroom of our original room. It is a bit of distance to the city area as well. We're both in shape, so the walk didn't bother us, but it was a pain if you just had to get down to the city to pick something up. Those are probably the two negatives about this location. The staff was helpful in moving us out of the first room. The gym was very nice - it had all the work-out equipment anyone would need. The downside was that you had to pay a daily rate for it. If I were to go back again, I'd probably check out other options even though the stay was pleasant. Probably the San Sebastian.

We flew to Barcelona and got the train ( Change at El Prat 2.50 euros ...bargain) There are taxis at the station to take you to the hotel.The check in was good and they had our request and we got a lovely room. Decor was good nice balcony, lovely view... Mini bar, hairdryer etc. There is room service if you want it. We joined the MAS card scheme online so you can get a 2 for 1 breakfast ,which we did a couple of days. I was really impressed ,the fruit was to die for and Champers if you fancy an early morning tipple !!!The MAS card also gets you a late checkout at no additional cost which was handy. The pool area is lovely..comfy beds and towels provided....the pool itself was great . It was quiet but that suited us .Good restaurant service by the pool the....choice and quality was good. Sitges is 15min walk from the hotel you can't get lost...there is a scenic walk which takes slightly longer but the views are great.You can also get taxi, Sitges is great lots of windy cobbled streets ....good shopping and fab restaurants and bars.

There was a festival on when we were there which was good fun.We discovered the Marina this time..... it's only 5mins walk from the hotel.....be warned the steps are steep.....you can go other ways which is easier on the legs. The Marina was bustling at the weekend...lots of restaurants and a few cocktail bars...a nice way to spend an evening.We headed up to Barcelona for the day took about 40mins... 5 Euro return the train takes you right to the the Centre.

So I was looking for somewhere where we would feel safe and where there were restaurants within easy distance of the hotel.The Melia was a great choice for us. The room was very nice with an extra bed put into a seaview twin as there were 3 of us. Lovely view of Sitges town from our room.The pool was lovely and there was no fight for sunbeds - always plenty to go round. The atmosphere was very relaxed, mainly Spanish families or older couples, gay couples or small groups of gay men. Oh and a sprinkling of English which suited us fine!People had advised me that this is primarily a business hotel - personally it felt a lot more friendly and relaxing. The staff at reception were very helpful and efficient.Breakfast waas good if you got down before 10 but after that they stop replenishing and for 18 euro a head limited choice can be somewhat irritating.The hotel is a 3 minute walk to the port area and this was the best surprise of all for us. We were expecting an area devoid of atmosphere but somewhere easy to get to. It's a lovely area with a really relaxed atmosphere and a great choice of bars and restaurants to eat in. The quality of food is excellent and so much better value than in Barcelona. If I was looking for a quick break with my husband for a couple of nights of wining and dining we'd definitely go for the port. Equally, my children were welcomed in any of the bars and restaurants we tried.Sitges town is a couple of minutes in a cab - at 5 euros well worth saving tired legs.

The large suite is ok in design and furnishings but just fabulous as far as location, views and glamour is concerned. With its 2 large balconies it has sunshine from the morning to the late night and absolutely breathtaking views over the Mediteranean and the old town of Sitges. At this price (approx \u9227?350 a night) you'll not find more space (85 m2, about 120 m2 with the connecting room) and a better view. The suite offers a very large bathroom with full size jaccuzi which my mum very much enjoyed every day. The only downside to the room is that there are no coffee or tea making facilities, that the terrace furniture is a bit on the cheap side and that the description of the suite implies there are 2 double beds (it says 2x2 bed), but this really means that the one bed is 2 meter by 2 meter.If you want to treat yourself to some glamour, go here! The hotel staff is wonderful and all services and facilities are immaculate and well maintained. Don't worry about the walking distance to Sitges, it's just a 5 minute walk and you'll get peace and quiet in return since the area is very very quiet.", "Date": "Jun 16, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR999130710", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "great as ever Stayed 3 nights in May 2006....been to the hotel before, although 15 mins walk from the centre of town, this is a great hotel for service, peace and great value....paid 110 euros for 2 including breakfast.

The breakfast is buffet style and vast with excellent service.....only a 3 min walk to the nudist beach with a great cafe bar serving excellent spanish food all day.

Rooms were standard, the bathrooms a little tired, but nothing majorly wrong.The location is on the outskirt, which makes it quieter and it is a short (although steep) walk down to the port restaurants and beach. The town was 20-30 mins walk, which was pleasant despite some of the contradictory comments on here...sure you walk across non-developed land, but it is safe, clean and I don't remember any grotty houses!Disappointing part of the trip was reception forgot to call us to wake us up for our booked cab to the train station. As a result we had to pay \u9227?5 to rush to the airport. They offered no reason, apology or refund, but mainly because we couldn't be bothered to wait for the manager to sort it out.All in all a good trip and if I were to go to Sitges again, I would probably opt for here.", "Date": "Oct 17, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR458446276", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "MatthewRob"}, {"Content": "Quiet Place on the Sea We stayed here for one night before taking a cruise out of Barcelona.

But then it's down hill from there - at least it was for us.It is stuck in the middle of no where on its own right on the outskirts of Sitges. It's about an hours walk from Sitges. You have to walk across derelict building land to get to Sitges, past some grotty houses and then uphill and downhill to the first focal point. It's a tedious and boring walk. Day in day out. But that's just to get to the first bit of Sitges. Then there is a 30 minute trudge to the main bit. So at night if you're not that mobile it's taxis.The hotel looks big, but the garden is very small with a small cold pool. Overlooked by apartment blocks.Breakfast was ok. But not the hot food. It was greasy oily eggs quivering under hot lamps. Why do Melia do this? Why can't they have cooking stations where you can get stuff fresh? Dinner was apalling. I could only just manage the salad bar. The hot food was disgusting. I have now reached the final conclusion that the Spanish cannot cook.The service was frosty at best. This is not the friendliest part of Spain - Andalucia and Marbella and Seville put this area to absolute shame. Several of the waiters were nasty old queens who looked as if they had sour lemons in certains parts of their anatomy!At night the hotel was boring. Nothing to do. And nothing to do around it. Apart from face that trek across dark building plots.The room was standard Melia.As for Sitges, well, after having had holidays on the Italian Rivieras, the South of France and Marbella etc., Sitges is simply a depressing, funless, cheerless dump. The only decent day trip is to Barcelona. Compare that to the trips to be had from Cannes, Marbella and Sorrento.Overall we found this hotel to be strangely depressing. There were 2 other Londoners there, who were similarly down at heart and flew back early. That left us with frosty faced Spanish and the ghastly ugly sisters waiters.Seriously, if anyone thinks that this hotel is 5 star then they need to travel more. And this is the most dreary and pointless part of Spain.Sorry to be so negative, but time is life and holidays are precious time, so if it's bad it's bad.", "Date": "Sep 30, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR798220306", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "StevefromLondon"}, {"Content": "Great corporate hotel but fair location The room and the hotel itself were great.

Bus to town runs every 30 minutes but did not take it as nightlife does not get going till well past 11 pm and the bus stops running well before that.

I\u9e93d hate to see the others!! The rooms are noisy (none of the doors close without slamming), and when I moved rooms today to what I hoped would be a quieter end of the hotel, I discovered a room with a very damp carpet that no one seems to know anything about, and a doorframe that looks as if someone has kicked in the door. There was also a pair of dirty socks hanging in the bathroom of the original room I checked into. To make matters worse, there was confusion over what I thought I had booked over the internet and what was actually on offer. Staff polite, but uninterested. Also one of the lifts kept sticking...

Lovely (somewhat classic) decorated rooms, plush carpets, mirrors everywhere so don\u9e93t be shy walking about when you\u9e93ve just come out of the shower.The beds are fantastic, never felt more rested. They even have a pillow menu, if you require another type. First we had a standard room on the north side, but because there was no view and no sun we changed it to a superior room, the best 18 euro extra I ever spent. The hotel is built on a hill, so the view from the balcony was fantastic, just relax and watch the sun set over Sitges and the bay. The pool area was very nice too, and the hotel is just a stroll away from two beaches (one nudist). This hotel hardly has any downsides. The walk to Sitges downtown is just a little too far, it takes about 15 mins (all downhill), take a taxi back (approx 6 euro). There is a busstop in front of the hotel, however the buses only come every half hour till 8 pm. Another downside is that there is not much in the immediate area. The food in the hotel is average, but there are lots of nice, slightly snooty, restaurants at the marina.Tip for downtown, Coco Rico is a very nice bar right in the heart of Sin Street. It features Latin music, and they have lovely Caipirinha\u9e93s (8,50 euro) plus great entertainment, consisting of three go go dancers: a very feminine guy (great dancer), a lady boy (transvestite) and a genuine girl (at least I think so).
