The apartment was a 3rd floor (2nd floor in France,) walk-up. It was clean, tastefully decorated, and had everything we needed. The beds and linens were comfortable - there is a double bed in the loft and a twin day bed that is a \"real bed.\" We had free calls to the U.S., free wi-fi that was very reliable, and a market right next door! We were glad we brought travel sized shampoos and soaps, etc., but we could have purchased these things easily if we hadn't. There was bath tissue, paper towels, and dish washing soap in the small kitchen. There is also a washer/dryer in the kitchen. The bathroom is very small - common for Europe.

Indeed, we found one. The apartment at 29 Rue de Gramont was in a great location and just a stroll from the Opera Garnier, Le Madeleine, department stores and numerous cafes and shops. Despite being in the centre of everything, the apartment was very quiet. We were met on time by a representative from Special Apartments who took us on a tour of the apartment and showed us how to work the modern appliances, including a washing machine/dryer combo. The two bedrooms were comfortably furnished with new doonas and each bedroom had a separate marble bathroom. Our daughter came over from London to see us, so having all this room was a bonus. There was another separate loo off the dining room, in the laundry.The kitchen was fitted with all modern stove, microwave and dishwasher and the 6 seater dining room furniture matched the black and gold theme of the furnishings in the large loungeroom. The whole apartment looked thoroughly stylish. A large, widescreen TV came in handy on occasions as it received dozens of channels including English news channels. Free Wi-Fi was included as were free telephone calls to most countries (land line only). By the time we picked up some baguettes, croissants and a bottle of Moet from the Monoprix supermarket nearby, we were starting to feel like locals! The apartment will comfortably accommodate 4 people in 1 queen size bed and two singles. We stayed here for 5 nights and enjoyed the apartment immensely, as well as the buzzy area outside.

This did not bother me at all during the day. At night my friend, who was using the VERY COMFORTABLE SOFA BED , slept soundly without ear plugs. Apparently she can sleep through anything! I slept soundly too, but only because I used good ear plugs. The trick with using earplugs is firstly to ensure you have the ones that cancel out most noise and secondly , if using regularly/frequently,to apply Vaseline to them prior to each use. This way they go in more easily and come out more easily, but more importantly you don't get sore ears. It is important to get them right in , hold until they have fully expanded. If you can still hear any noise you haven't got them in far enough. In all other respects this is a FABULOUS APARTMENT.It is VERY COMFORTABLE and has good space. It is in the BEST LOCATION for exploring Paris. I have stayed in many apartments in different parts of Paris and this is the best spot. The company specialapartments.com are the BEST COMPANY TO DEAL WITH. They make everything so easy and are a pleasure to deal with. I am surprised none of the reviews for this apartment #007 on their website mention the NOISY TRAINS though, because it is only FAIR that people should know this prior to choosing their apartment.

Then it will probably have some worse problem! City Apartment living is seldom quiet. I'll STAY WITH THIS ONE.

The bathroom is a shower curtain over a tiny, tiny wet room (a shower with a very small vanity basin) and has the dimmest lighting imaginable and no mirror.

If someone is using the sofa bed that takes off half the living area which is already overrun by suitcases as you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t store them in the closet. Metal closets in the bedroom create a din when doors that aren't jammed shut are opened. You have to lean around a jammed-shut door to access the washing machine and there is no light so it is difficult to read the dials to operate it properly. There is no automatic, electric clothes dryer, just a fold out drying rack which you have to place in front of a wall radiator. The ironing board needs a new padded cover and the iron needs an extension cable as it is about 2 feet long. Lighting is dim, very dim, you'll look like a drag queen after putting on makeup because you couldn't see when applying kind of dim. The kitchen area is basic: a bar fridge, a 2 burner induction stove top, a portable toaster type oven which is stacked up high as there is no bench space so difficult to use anyway, a microwave, a drying rack for dishes wired onto a plywood tray which has to be tipped into the sink to pour away water that collects. There are extension powerpoints off one wall point everywhere. Be prepared to buy coffee filters, toilet paper, dish cloths (the one that was there when we arrived looked like it had been used on a floor), facial tissues, salt/pepper (if you eat in), garbage bags, dish liquid, laundry powder.

I had stayed in a hotel down the road on a previous trip to Paris with my wife (Hotel Opera Victoires) and it was lovely, but this time around we have a kid, and he goes to bed at 7pm, so hotel rooms don't really work that well for us anymore as going to bed at 7 in the evening while on holidays is not ideal. I cannot stress how great the location of the apartment is - the Rue Montorgueil is litereally 50 yards away and this is a lovely Parisian street with lots of food shopsa nd a few cafes, so it's so easy to stock up on your essentials or eat out if you prefer. We did the typical French way of shopping on the day of our arrival - bakery, butcher, green grocer, cheesemonger, patisserie for some treats and the wine shop. The apartment itself was well kitted out - there was 6 of everything ( I had read there was only three, so maybe they bought some more) and it's all lovely Villeroy and Boch stuff and was otherwise well equipped with a good fridge, microwave and gas hob, kettle, toaster all easy to use. The apartment was very clean, the bed comfortable. The shower worked well and was also clean (maybe a few small bits of mould about, but not anything that would make you think it had not been cleaned - it was spotless and I had no problem to use it, nor did my wife and neither of us like unclean showers. There was a few small patches of flaking paint (one in the kitchen and one in the shower room), but they were very small and didn't make the place look bad. I actually think they added to the feel of the place - this is an aprtment in a very old building so there will be some things like this that give some character. Most importantly the whole place was really warm and very easy to heat, which was very important to us as it was very cold outside when we were there. There is also a lift, although we could not fit our buggy in it (we didn't bring a small stroller, if we did it would have fitted fine, but instead we opted to bring our big buggy with the thick chunky wheels to make the cobbled Paris streets a little easier on our son and indeed on us psuhing it around). It was the right thing to do. We had to carry the buggy up and down the stairs (two floors), which really was not a big deal at all and didn't bother us at all. In summary, this place was perfect for us as a family to stay. The ability for Specail Apartmnents to have a travel cot there was very convenient. We were abel to put our son down and then retire to the living room in the evening. The metro does pass underneath the apartment and it didn't distrub him at all, and he's a very light sleeper. It's like a gentle roll of thunder every few minutes, I know that must sound awful, but trust me it isn't - you don't even notice it most of the time, even when it starts early in the morning. I would totally recommedn this for a couple to stay or even a one child family - (not sure about more than that though).", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Time\u201d", "Author": "colindiffer", "ReviewID": "UR50480147", "Content": "We had a fantastic time in Paris thanks to the staff at Special Apartments.

The apartment was on the fourth floor with no lift but it was clean and spacious. From the beginning we felt at home in Paris. The location and set up had atmosphere. We became residents not tourists. The location is perfect, we walked to Notre Dame, the Louvre, the Shops and enjoyed the ile de la cite in the early morning before the bus loads arrived. Very close to metro line 7 and Notre Dame RER it was easy to visit anywhere in Paris. The management could not have been better. We were able to check in early ( arrived in CDG at 6am) and they were most concerned about our being disturbed by workmen.
