Decent bathrooms are rather high on my wife's wish-list when it comes to accommodations, and these really check that box. The breakfast area/courtyard has also been updated and turned into a pretty little atrium, with a beautiful \"living wall' of plants. Like a little oasis in the middle of a busy Paris. Beautiful!

The hotel is very clean and quiet; the rooms are small but comfortable. The hotel is close to several Metro stops and is only about a 15 minute walk away from the Louvre and about 20 minutes away from Notre Dame and Saint-Chapelle. Also, St. Germain is a lovely neighborhood with a number of high-end shops, galleries, and cafes. It is an excellent spot for people-watching. Overall, I feel that this hotel gives travelers more of an authentic French experience than the big-box, American chain hotels in more touristy areas, but at the same time it succeeds in making foreign travelers feel comfortable and safe. My only caveat for other travelers is the elevator situation. There is only one elevator and it is very small by American standards -- you can really only fit one person at a time in it comfortably, and no more than two at a time in any event. All of the rooms are easy to reach via a lovely spiral staircase, so the elevator situation was a non-issue for me and my companions on both of my trips, but I could see it as a potential problem if multiple members of your group were unable to handle the stairs.", "Date": "July 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cGenuine welcoming hospitality where no request is too much\u201d", "Author": "NACLLondon", "ReviewID": "UR32856132", "Content": "My wife and I stayed for two mid week nights.

From the moment I check in, I am greeted with a warm hug, kiss on the cheeks, chat and one of any of their great rooms. The receptionists are all great especially Valierie in the morning and Laura. They know all, keep everyone happy and accomodate you better than any receptionist in the world. The rooms at the Hotel Pas de Calais are spotless, clean, secure and an oasis from the hustle outside. Mind you, they are not fancy but are most comfortable and cozy. Breakfast is magical. You are pampered with Paris' kindest ladies (be sure to ask for Marika and Jocelyne) serving you the best French bread in Paris, creamy Camberbert, jams, yogurt, fruit, fresh squeezed juice and tea/coffee. The welcoming smile and hugs are worth the breakfast alone. I love them all. During this most recent trip, I had two things happen different than the other trips. I was ill with a stomach virus my first few days. The night clerks (David in particular) made sure I was taken care of, brought me extra blankets and tea. It was comforting to know he was there and a phone call away should I require additional support. It was later in the week my birthday. All the staff wished me happy birthday and when I returned from a day on the town I was astonished to find in my room roses that the staff had purchased on their own (thank you Jocelyne!), a bottle of champagne from the management (thanks Syline) along with snacks and a card. WOW! A double WOW! It's tough getting older in your late 40's but the team at the hotel made sure I felt special that day. These days of mega hotel complexes like the Marriot or Sheraton as well as super luxury hotels like the Four Seasons, have lost the personal touch and run their businesses to maximize their profits. Not at the Hotel Pas de Calais--the managers and staff are all like family and run the hotel like you are part of the family and are welcoming you back home to rest, rejuvenate, feel loved and special.

The mattress was thin; there was no really usable drawer space; the main light was very bright; the bathroom was small, felt old, & had funny swinging doors; the paint was peeling; the walls were very thin. The room itself wasn't tiny, but felt shabby. This isn't terribly surprising for Paris, but I've stayed at 3 other hotels nearby at lower prices with better rooms (though some of them had other issues), so nicer rooms in this price range do exist.

The reviews for this Parisian Hotel seemed favourable so we booked through Expedia \"a Superior Double Room Recently Renovated\" for \u20ac150 a night. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by a plywood front door and a lobby undergoing serious renovation.....think plywood floor, ladders against the wall and exposed wires. We had not been informed of the renovation during the booking process and were very disappointed, especially as our roomrate did not reflect this inconvenience. We held out better hope for our recently renovated room. When we opened the door to our room and saw the state of it we were most upset. The carpet and chairs were stained. The paintwork was scuffed, tiles were missing in the bathroom and the shower room was tiny. Furthermore when examining the hotel tariff a superior double did not seem to be an option. It was definitely not recently renovated! We spent the afternoon wandering the streets of Paris looking for alternative accomodation. We could only find this for the second night of our stay....but from our afternoons research can tell you that there are definitely better value hotels in this lovely area of Paris. There is nothing that we can recommend about this hotel.

Safe(we found no pickpockets), convenient to move, and charming place. We chose Pas de Calais to stay. We stayed the standard double room on 4th floor (as I requested the room in high floor). An accommodation was exactly the same as shown on the website. The moment we saw the room, we like it very much. It was such a beautiful room much more than we expected. Wide enough, extremely clean, and good sense designed. That quiet noble room would suite for the person who likes meditation such as a philosopher (J.P. Sartre stayed at this hotel). I'm sorry there were regrettable points, too. First, every time we turned on the heater switch(As it was a chilly night), the fuse blowed and blacked out. At the end, the staff brought us a portable heater. The air-conditioning was good, and heating in the winter will be no problem. Second, when we use a shower, sometimes it becomes to supply only very hot water. The change happens suddenly(oh la-la!). Finally I found that it occurs when another room's person use the shower. I think equipments of this hotel are rather old(if you stayed at suite, maybe no problem). However, this hotel has a great charm which makes up for them. For example, it's classical taste, nostalgic atmosphere, and so on. Here, the same staff works every day, so they know each other and their cooperation is very good. Not only that but also they remembered our face. As a result, we were able to communicate well. A front staff reserved the concert tickets for us. It was held In the church \"La Madeleine\"! We had very good time in the historic architecture. We want to come back, but want a small refrigerator in the room for the foods we procure in nearby market...", "Date": "September 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gainesville, Texas", "Title": "\u201cA great little charming French owned hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3606562", "Content": "We traveled in a group of 5 american couples. We loved the Pas de Calais hotel. The warm and friendly owner, greeted us and was extremely helpful to our group. The hotel is well-located on the left bank among the upscale shops and restaurants of beautiful Paris. We booked a larger room, a suite on an upper floor. Our bathrooms were spotlessly clean and the suite a nice large size. One of the couples had the room decorated in red and white cotton toile, which was beautiful. This is a small French hotel and doesn't offer the amenities of a larger hotel, such as a bar, but for what it is, it can't be beat. My husband and I walked the streets of Paris on a prior trip to find a clean, charming small left bank hotel. Pas de Calais fit the bill. The owner delivered flowers to our room on the day we checked out with a note which read, \" Pleae know that you are welcome anytime you return to Paris\". I would wholeheartedly reccommend this hotel to anyone looking for this type facility. We loved Paris and found the people to be extremely friendly and helpful. For the same money, we choose Pas de Calais over the Hotel Lutecia, which on another trip we found to have dirty rooms and baths and be in worn condition. We would NEVER stay in the Lutecia again.", "Date": "June 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cA comfortable hotel with a terrific staff\u201d", "Author": "UNC65", "ReviewID": "UR3103603", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Pas de Calais over the New Year's weekend.
