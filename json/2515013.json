Great location - 10 blocks east of Pike Place Market, 4-5 blocks from shopping (Westlake, Pacific Place, Nordstrom, Niketown) and restaurants. Rooms were nice - clean, updated, comfortable bed, nice shower pressure, kitchen (everything but an oven). Water from tap in kitchen was cloudy - didn't taste or look good (which is weird, as Seattle generally has good water). Speaking of water, the workout room was completely out of water - I called, they said they'd send someone right away, but 15 minutes later and still no water. Workout room is open 24 hours/day. TVs built in to nice equipment (not the cheap stuff - I'm over 200 pounds, and I ran 60 minutes on the treadmill with no slip). They provide headphones and towels. The hotel faces the freeway - just above I-5. You'll hear cars and semi's all day/night, but it's not bad - I'm a light sleeper, and the noise was tolerable (more of a constant sound vs being by a bus stop or hearing sirens). The breakfast was one of the best I've had - kids and I loved it. Bacon was good, waffles were excellent, fresh fruit, yogurt, juice...all good. And all included with our room.

I couldn't believe that others in our group who stayed at the W, actually paid only $10.00 more than we did. It was freezing in my room and because the hotels infracture is so antiquated, maintenance has to physically come into your room to switch the heat on if the guest before you was there during warmer weather. The hotel it's self looks pretty new, but according to maintenance, it's just \"a pretty mask over an old and wrinkled face.\" And then the alarm clocks. I was there during the time change to daylight savings time and wanted to set both the time and alarm on the alram clock before heading. Well I couldn't do that because maintenance has to come up and do that too. I've never had an alarm clock where I wasn't able to change the time or ever had heating/cooling that required a strange man at10:30 PM while in my pajamas to come fix it. And don't even ask me how long it took for him to get to me. He left at 11:00 PM so I had to trust my wake up call which I surprisingly didn't get either. To top it all off, the Front Desk manager Dawnita, didn't even seem to care about my concerns and wasn't the least bid interested in her dissatisfied guest that beat me to the puch. I believe the solution to us both was, \"I know it's frustrating but it's just one of those things that is what it is.\" WOW!!

I requested a quiet room and they found me a room on the courtyard side that was just fantastic. The staff was extraordinarily friendly and during my 4-day stay they frequently greeted me and inquired about my adventures about town. They were quick to answer questions and accommodate a few requests. They even provided SUNSHINE on a couple of days (oh wait, that may not be able to take credit for that....). The location was excellent. I was able to take the light rail from the airport (40 minute ride for under $3? yes please), and then walk 5-6 blocks to the hotel. I rented a car one day from the Hertz counter a block away, and jumping on the interstate was a breeze. The iconic Pike Street Market is an 8 block walk down the hill, and if you walk a few blocks east you're in the heart of the Capitol Hill District with all kinds of food and shopping. The convention center is located next door, and a very unique urban park built over the interstate provides a fantastic place to escape is integrated into the landscape with remarkable precision. A delightful bonus that I enjoyed several times. If you aren't familiar with the Homewood Suites brand, not only do they serve a hot breakfast but also a light dinner Monday-Thursday evenings that is a great deal especially for weary business travelers who might not feel like venturing out at the end of a long day. One last thing for people who ARE familiar with the Homewood Suites brand.

There is a very tall shower head in room 618 and we had requested this room in advance and confirmed it with a phone call the day before our stay.

We have been on the side street, which had the best balcony of all the rooms. This room has a tiny balcony and essentially no view, only of the small court yard and the apartment next door. It was necessary to keep the curtains closed because we concluded that if we could see the people in the apartments, they could see us as well. This is the first time I have been disappointed with the breakfast. There is usually some type of egg dish and this was a breakfast burrito. I am not a picky eater, but the burrito was dried out, the wrapper crispy and the sausage and egg mixture was greasy and inedible. I gave up after several bites and had the hard boiled eggs and a banana. The coffee is consistently good and I love the flavored creamer as an option.

The kitchen had a counter that sat 3 or 4, included a full sized refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, and stove top. No oven, but we did not need an oven (we were on vacation---who wants to bake?) Dishes, tableware, pots and pans were included. The living room had a couch and flat screened television. The bedroom had two large closets and a very comfortable bed. A desk and chair was located between the living room and bedroom. Free wifi, too! The hotel is a well situated--just a short walk to the covention center, downtown shops, museums, and Pike Market. We picked up some great wine, cheese, and food and enjoyed it in our room. Also, the Capital Hill Area is another nice walk with interesting restaurants and shops. Eat at Sitka and Spruce if you like unusual mediterranean and north African flavors--absolutely delicious. We had a very good, reasonably priced Italian meal at La Spiga on 12th Avenue. We splurged on caviar at the Seattle Caviar Company where you can taste (generous samples) before you buy. There is no shortage of sights and things to do in Seattle but for something a little different, visit the Seattle Bug Safari, below Pike Place. It's a small bug \"museum\" that we enjoyed and kids will be enthralled! The hotel is relatively new, in excellent condition, and the rooms are roomy, very clean and quiet. Lots of families were staying at the hotel and I thought it might be noisy but it was not. The free breakfast was impressive--hot waffles, eggs, sausages, yogurt, cereals, coffee, tea, and juice.

Great location, groovy room, low price, helpful staff, yummy breakfast...dude, just book this thing already! You can walk to just about everything from here: Pike Place Market; the monorail to the Space Needle; nice stores (and Ross!); cool restaurants; the waterfront; and the art museum without having to walk through any janky neighborhoods. (safety is always a consideration to me) And hey, don't listen to these wussies who cry about it being too far or uphill walking back to the hotel. My wife and I are in our fifties and, after a full day of walking around town, we freakin leapt like gazelles back up to the hotel. It's uphill but not a big deal at all, certainly not worth mentioning unless someone is terribly out of shape (might be time to get a Rascal). The rooms are BIG and full of great stuff! (get it? \"Big\" is in caps to emphasize the big-ness) By great stuff , I mean free wi-fi, big flat screen, and a kitchenette that has everything but the....wait a minute...INCLUDING the kitchen sink! Okay, one reviewer complained that there was no conventional oven. Whaddaya gonna do? Cook a turkey in your hotel room? Sheeesh! The bed!!! Oh my, the bed was so comfortable I was down and out quicker than Old Yeller. I can't really comment on the noise factor as we actually enjoyed throwing open the windows and letting that cool Seattle air and the hum of the city lull us to sleep. That's how we roll. A free breakfast buffet,(delicious and nutritious) and a free dinner Monday through Thursday, including (you're gonna love this) free beer and wine. Ahhhhhh. Check this out. On the day we left to board our cruise, we didn't realize all the cabs in the city were booked, as several ships board and depart on the same day. The guy at the front desk says, \"let me see what I can do.\" He makes some phone calls and gets us a stretch limo for the price of a cab! Five minutes later, it arrives and we're on our way.

The hotel has a decent location which is right next to the convention center, but can be a fairly long walk to the market or down to the pier. It may not seem like a great distance, but after a long day of sightseeing and walking, the walk back to the hotel can be tedious as it is located uphill. It is also set near a busy freeway, so anyone who is a light sleeper should request a room facing the courtyard. The hotel was luckily able to fulfil our request for one and we had no issues with any sort of noise from the outside. One of the nicest features is the size and layout of the room suites. The suite came complete with a fridge and freezer, 2 burner stovetop, dishwasher, sink, plenty of cupboard space and dishes. The bedroom was quite large and the living area the same which also came with a fold out bed which was surprisingly comfy. A huge bathroom made getting ready in the morning much easier for everyone as well. On top of the great rooms they also offer a great free breakfast every morning and even a free dinner Monday to Thursday. I have to say it was some of the best (free) food I have ever had but if you have the time and money you might want to stop somewhere else. We unfortunately did not have a lot of time in the mornings so the free breakfast was a lifesaver and is one of the best reasons to stay. Certainly not one of the luxurious locations I have stayed, but nothing to really complain about as it was very clean and the staff were extremely helpful with any questions we had. They also offer a small pool and hot tub which we didn't know about until we got there, so don't forget to pack your bathing suit if you want to go for a dip.

My wife and I didn't get to the hotel until about 11pm and when we arrived we were told that the valet was off for the evening so we had to park ourselves in a space that was only 50 feet from the lobby entrance. It was an open garage so I installed a security club on the steering wheel and we went back inside where they told us they still needed to check our keys into the valet office. When we came down the next morning, I gave the valet my ticket and let him know about the security club. He said it was no problem. We checked out of the hotel while they were getting our car and I asked for a discount for parking since I was unable to use the valet service when we arrived. They were persistent and said that if I didn't pay the $30 now (25 for overnight parking, 5 for parking fees/taxes) they would just charge our card. I paid it and as soon as we finished checking out, the valet returned on foot saying he could not get our car started. At this point, I was a bit irritated. So I grabbed the keys and hauled our stuff out to the car myself and we left. When I installed the club on the steering wheel, the wheel lock had engaged which also locks the ignition.

Well, someday arrived in June for a meeting at the nearby Sheraton. Hence, I chose this hotel as it was cheaper and I do like Homewood Suites. I was here 4 nights and like most any Homewood Suites there is a stove, fridge, ample dishes/silverware in the room, two room suites, free breakfast every day and a free dinner Mon-Thur. Not sure why the website doesn't specify a pool, but there is a nice pool open in the summer. The breakfast area always had waffle irons and fruit for the waffles, plus many other great choices. I did not notice any problems with keeping the breakfast area stocked as some recent reviews have commented on. I asked for a view of I-5 for old times sake and enjoyed the view (but Seattle sure is overgrown and this view shows that), but light sleepers or even medium sleepers beware. It is somewhat loud and the A/C/fan is also somewhat loud. However, I like background noise when I sleep and had no problems but again light sleepers beware. Even though the hotel does supply earplugs--I'd suggest asking for a courtside room that does not face I-5, of which the hotel has some if outdoor noise bothers you. There are some clear misses and this is one of my least favorite Homewood Suites (which I admit are as a group well above average and this hotel is above average). I reserved a an exact room on the 7th floor (you can do that online with some Homewood Suites) AND confirmed the location via phone 20 hours before arriving but they tried putting me in a different room and denied I had arranged a room. I knew the system well enough and had evidence to disprove them and did get a room near the top that faced I-5. They messed up on my room rate even with me confirming twice what the price would be and then messed things up on how they reported in on my credit card--which affected bonus points (but I also corrected that problem later on). Like most Homewood Suites, being a Gold or Diamond Hhonors member means little here, but it may have helped in room selection a little. Overall, nice perks of the Homewood Suites, but it is loud, not in the greatest part of town (but safety is a minor issue in my mind), but the staff has problems with matching online reservations and prices to reality.

We used the shuttle extensively (another hotel even told us NO Seattle hotel has shuttles) and the two shuttle drivers were helpful, friendly, and went out of their way to help us. Don't know if it's because we tipped every time, but I have a feeling they're just good guys. The food was wonderful - not haute cuisine but for a family on a budget with three little children and a grandmother, it worked out well for us. Gave us a portable crib when we asked. Took care of our luggage. Beds and sheets and pillows were very comfortable. The sofa bed was very uncomfortable but I've never slept on a comfortable one before. The windows did seem like they were open because they didn't seem to seal well but we did not hear outside noise, just a sort of hum from life outside which actually helps our children sleep better. A couple nights we heard sirens for a few seconds. One morning we got an apology for the fire alarm going off the night before but we were never disturbed any of our nights (and my husband is a pretty light sleeper) and certainly never heard a fire alarm. Even higher end hotels like the Hyatt have kept us up with noise from the hallway and other guests but we never heard a thing. Coffee is wonderful. Wifi worked well and no other place we stayed at during our trip in Seattle, Vancouver or Alaska had free wifi and the wifi you paid for was much worse than Homewood's speed. So many of their amenities are free as well, that it took a little adjustment with our other two hotels on our trip. Probably the best endorsement came from my children who kept asking us to go back to the Homewood, even after staying at a higher end hotel in Vancouver (snobby, not so helpful, more crowded) and a cruise ship! This is the place we'll stay at if we ever are in Seattle again, and we've recommended it to my sister to recommend to her friends as she lives in a suburb of Seattle. I like businesses that aren't afraid to ask people to give feedback on public sites and their own surveys because they are truly out to be a good hotel. None of the other hotels we stayed at cared about what we thought. This hotel did while we were there and when we came back.

The closet in the living room is huge. There was a balcony as well... though the weather didn't make it that inviting while we were visiting. Loved the 5-7 pm reception with wine, beer, and much more food than I've ever experienced at such a venue. There were even fresh baked cookies besides the meatball sandwiches and salad bar one night.

The hotel offers free breakfast (scrambled eggs, waffles, fruit, yogurt, etc.) and a \"light\" dinner with wine/beer. Pretty good, really. But often, I just wander down to nearby Whole Foods and pick up some goodies to throw together in the room. They've got a microwave/fridge and all the silverware/goodies you need. On the Capitol Hill side, there is a great Spanish Restaurant \"Tango\" that's right across the street. And about 10 blocks away is a hot yoga studio, \"Sweatbox\" that I frequent. I'm grateful Homewood Suites has a guest laundry for my sweaty workout clothes. The lobby is spacious enough to meet someone on-site, but I requested (and rec'd at no additional charge) access to a private conference room. Very nice. They've also got a small workout area (I've never used it) and a billiards room (been there twice). Like other Homewood Suites, this property has a round-the-clock sundry shop--which includes microwavable dishes, ice cream (b-a-a-d Ben + Jerry's!!) and lots of other stuff. The parking, like anywhere in downtown Seattle, is outrageous ($27/day). I belong to Hilton's \"HHonors\" program--so the staff is very nice to me (they're nice anyway!).

That was because the windows didn't fit the frames completely in both the living room and the bedroom. That's why I couldn't sleep on both nights. The sheets were thick and seemed like good quality, but they felt kind of rough. Since it's a Homewood, the hotel room set was nice and convenient with a stove, microwave, sink, fridge, and dishwasher. They provide pots, pans, and dinner ware. It would have been nice to buy fresh crab, fish, fruits, and vegetables from the market . There is a fitness center with a stationary bike, treadmill, elliptical machine, and benches for free weights. The billiards room is fun and has a leather couch with tv. They serve a generous breakfast, so the dining area was bustling around 9:30 am. The business center has two computers and is in the dining area. They provide free rides in the Homewood van, which is a Ford Flex. There are several drop-off points, including the International District and the Public Market, but they pick you up where they dropped you off. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk down to the Public Market. There are lots of shops and Starbucks along the way. The hotel provides umbrellas if you need one. Of course, it rained both days we were there.

He handled many different tasks and guests, sometimes several at the same time and always with a smile on his face. He went the extra mile to make sure as guests were well taken care of. He is a jewel and the hotel is so very fortunate to have him. This man will go far in the hospitality business and will be a definite asset to the hotel. Phala at the front desk was amazing and I watched her handle the many guests arriving or leaving all at the same time with a calm, professional and friendly manner.

This hotel runs very well and their employees work together as a team, something you don't see very often anymore. I thanked as many people as I could for helping our family reunion be the special event it was.

Our room faced I-5 which didn't bother me. It was actually kind of nice to have a little white noise to sleep with. If vehicles drving at high speed bother you, bring some Ambien. I rarely heard sirens and was never woken up by the street noise. It was very comfortable to sleep here. We were by the elevators and I never heard a sound. The happy hour was a nice snack. I wouldn't really want to eat a full meal here. Seemed like Trader Joe's frozen food and salad in a bag. But not bad for a hotel happy hour. Beer on tap was Miller Lite. I went to The Pike at Pike Place Market for beer instead. They had a couple of wines but I didn't look at the selection. Breakfast was what you would expect from a hotel breakfast.

About a ten minute walk to Pike Place Market. If you're in town for a convention, the convention center is about a block away. The monorail station is four or five blocks away so it was easy to get to the Space Needle and EMP. The hotel shuttle took us to a Marniers game so we saved on transportation to the game. Lots of restaurants a few blocks away. My only complaint about the location is that there seemed to be a large amount of homeless in Seattle. This is obviously no fault of the hotel. Pretty much anywhere you stay around here, you will encounter them. I also noticed a shocking lack of police presence. Even saw a drug deal go down outside the convention center.

I stood there for awhile and she never even said anything to me even though she wasn't doing anything and I ended up being helped by another front desk employee. She used the f word within earshot of me several times while I was standing there, and rolled her eyes when the other employees asked her to help them out since they were busy. This happened two more times when I came to the front desk, this same girl refused to even make eye contact with me even though she wasn't busy and I had to wait for another employee to finish up with the customer they were helping.

Homewood (now a Hilton after being called Pike Place Suites and Summerfield under previous nameplates) quite simply was the best overall value we could find, and WE really knew where and what to look for. Its location is outstanding for walking, exploring and being right in the thick of the things most really want to \"see\" in Seattle. And if you need to go further, it's ideally situated to do it from. \"Top Marks\" for: Front Desk friendliness/knowledge, Engineer (we had a door lock glitch, so they gave us a quick upgrade 'til getting the room back open), Location (They are easy off I-5 and away from a lot of the one-way hassles of downtown) besides their valet during the week you may get lucky like us and find free parking across the street - from late Saturday through Sunday when meters are off) they're one block from the Wa State Conv Ctr if that's of interest, and only 3 blocks or so from the Regal Theater complex and literally scores of great local and chain restaurants and shops. Finally, it's a straight shot right down Pike about 9 easy blocks to the Pike Place Market \"pig\" entrance. \"Good Job\"s for: Rooms (a bit tired, but nice kitchens, baths, furnishings and comfy Hilton beds), Exercise Room with water cooler, towels, TV and some weights, plus 2xTreadmills, 2xEllipticals, 1 Recumbent Bike - all NEW Precor with Cardio Theater TV's and near-pro gym quality) \"Hot\" Breakfast (better than Denny's but not quite up to Embassy Suites standards - but the price- Free - was right!), Shuttle Service (we didn't use but it was a great itinerary and they were flexible about pick-ups until around 9 pm. Great if you are tired after walking all over the city. Biggest Surprise: The price, just over $100 incl. tax for an admittedly quiet night, just after New Year's. The Last Words...This is a great place to stay if you want a quiet and close-by hotel to kick back (even play pool in their lounge!), with a weekday manager's reception, and to keep some food, drink around your room (big fridge, a microwave and a stovetop, plus a coffee maker and the bonus - Starbucks coffee always hot in the lobby, incl. real creamer. You can buy munchies from their quick selection but there are markets everywhere, including a fairly close QFC supermarket up on Capitol Hill, a mini mart by the Conv. Ctr. and a nice IGA with decent wine prices right down on 3rd Ave. off Pike. If you want to work out and not pay extra, it's a 24-hour fantastic value - so pick the \"off-times\" to avoid any crowds and get a real workout incl. in your room price. Or just head down the hill, to Pike Place, Pioneer Square, or the waterfront. You'll be walking lots, especially back up the hill to the hotel, but there's lots of food and drink along the way to cure what \"ales\" you... \"Top Tips\" nearby from a Local \"Tourist\": Pike Place Pub for beer and magnificent crab-stuffed Salmon filet. Everything's wild, food is best quality, beer brewed there has won awards. McCormick and Schmick's...great drinks, consistently better seafood, reasonable wine list values. Key Lime Pie that is more like cheesecake but puts others to shame! Avoid Rock Bottom, Tap House Grill has a great selection though...Want to see Seattle and its environs from the water - try Argosy Cruises, a family-owned company, and always focused on service and true value. or just hop a WS Ferry!", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Downtown", "Title": "\u201cwe would always stay in this hotel when we are in seattle\u201d", "Author": "DowntownSeattle", "ReviewID": "UR52379197", "Content": "a hotel of choice if traveling with family. we loved the rooms with a kitchen. best of all the hotel had free breakfast and free dinner. the front desk staff was wonderful. free shuttle to nearby downtown areas.", "Date": "January 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "calgary, alberta, canada", "Title": "\u201cComforts of home and more\u201d", "Author": "solo-traveller1209", "ReviewID": "UR52275244", "Content": "I arrived on an early flight & arrived at the hotel just after 9am.

The bedroom and the living room were separate. There was also a kitchen with microwave, fridge, dishes, coffee maker, cutlery, a sink, cupboards, a cork screw and so on. Wonderful. The living room has a couch, a tv and a fireplace with a false fire. I think it's the best hotel I've ever seen for the price which was fair for a spot in the downtown very close.

This was a business/leisure trip to Seattle. My husband was on a business trip and my toddler and I tagged along.

We were told to call back and find out if the room gets done sooner. I wish he had offered to call us instead as we were brand new in the city. However that didn't stop us from spending our entire day exploring downtown, walking down the Pike place market and also did the duck tour. When we got back we were greeted with smiles by 2 young ladies. Our room was clean, spacious, facing the street ( as we requested) and had a crib for our toddler. They served breakfast every morning which was really fresh and tasty and I am talking about 'real' breakfast. They had scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, milk, cereal, fruits, yogurt, coffee and more. I mean do we every go in such detail every day to prepare our breakfast at home. I thought that was great. The staff was super friendly right from the maids, to front desk, to shuttle driver to managers themselves. They have a laundry and a suite shop. They have a reception light dinner every evening. My husband and I thought the light dinner every night with wine and beer was the best touch ever. We loved how managers would interact with guest and be there for dinner. It was a different meal every day. After working all day my husband loved to unwind with a glass of cold beer. It worked out really good for us because with a toddler we couldn't venture out for dinner every night for 6 days. This was a fun way for us to enjoy ourselves in the comfort of our hotel. The hotel had a shuttle service which took guests to main tourist spots. I used it a few times during the day when my husband was gone to take my baby to the aquarium and children's museum. Our 5 day stay at Homewood suite was one of our best stays ever in any hotel. We travel a lot both domestic and international but never have experienced such great service. I may be wrong but one night for dinner reception the GM Greg was hosting it. He was very nice and friendly and we talked about some restaurants and cupcake shops. I thought it was very nice of a GM to be a part of his hotel team that way ( that is if he was the same Greg) My husband and I enjoyed our stay at the hotel and even my super friendly toddler felt at home, She got smiles and compliments from all the staff members and I thought yes this sure is a kid friendly hotel :) I would recommend this hotel to any friend or family and can vouch for it.
