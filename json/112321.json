{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Romantic step back in time We stayed here on our wedding night. I'd wanted to stay in an old-fashioned Victorian place, and that's just what I got. The room was beautiful, if slightly run-down at the edges when you looked too closely. I felt like I'd stepped back in time, and it was perfect for a wedding night - romantic and cozy and easy to forget the world outside. We didn't eat there, so I can't speak to the food. The price was a bit dear for our budgets at the time, but a splurge at the time. The price does seem a little steep, maybe, but it is a unique sort of accommodation and you are paying for the historical experience as well as comfort, etc. We loved the breakfast delivered to our room, that we could enjoy by the window.

My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon. We've stayed in a lot of places in San Francisco, and this place was a nice change of pace. The outside is beautiful and just down the street is the famous Painted Ladies and across the street is Alamo Square Park. There was a free parking lot and limited parking available in the street. I think that is due to the fact that the location of this hotel is more residential than touristy. The only complaint was that every place we went required a taxi (the staff would call one for us and was very accomodating), but then again, we knew it was an out of the way hotel which was kind of why we stayed there. The lobby had a little bit of a funky smell, but what do you expect from a place thats as old as this! The rooms were wonderful! Very quaint...small tv, HUGE fireplace. The beds were comfortable, a very good complimentary breakfast in our room, great decor, and the service was FANTASTIC! We were given wonderful advice by the manager about restaurants, wineries, night clubs, or just interesting things to do in the city. We were looking for a nice, quiet, romantic place to spend our honeymoon and I think we made the absolute right choice!

They are pretty friendly people.We stayed in one of the Romeo and Juliet rooms on the first floor. The bathroom was huge and had a jet tub (I don't think they cleaned it very well though. They definitely didn't clean it while we were out the next day--we stayed 2 nights) It is an old house and it shows. Their bed linens are starting to wear thin and had a musty smell to it.Good points: The rooms are all distinct and they leave the doors open if they are unoccupied so you can roam around and look. Apparently they have a wine and cheese every night for guests to socialize but who wants to do that?I liked the breakfast in bed. You get a card that you tick off what you want for breakfast the next day and what time for them to bring it and hang it outside your door. The quiche is very yummy!

My wife and I decided that we would visit San Francisco for our honeymoon and found the Archbishop recommended in several travel books and decided that it would be a great place to spend three nights.The Archbishop operates like a bed and breakfast and is extremely unique. Breakfast is delivered to your room each morning along with the pastry cart from which you can make a selection. Our room was tastefully decorated and very cozy. The hotel supplies top of the line toiletries (mint shampoo and body cream). Our bed was very comfortable and was topped by a thick douvet and pillows that were actually pillows (a pet peeve of ours). The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel itself is located close to transit on a road frequented regularly by taxis so hailing one is never an issue. This hotel has a very small elevator which would only fit one or two people comfortably, otherwise you will need to climb potentially several flights of stairs depending on the location of your room. This was not a conern for us so we did not address this at the time of booking, so it is possible that those with limited mobility may be accomodated. Be sure to raise this concern if it applies.One of the best features of the Archbishop is that they offer a complimentary wine and cheese get together for the guests to enjoy each evening before dinner. There are several cheeses and wine to sample and this serves as an excellent opportunity to discuss your day with fellow guests and get new ideas for the next day.The only negative thing that I could say about the Archbishop is that in my opinion, a bed and breakfast should change their menu daily and not offer the same thing twice. All three mornings we were offered the same quiche (spinach or ham) which was nice on the first morning but we had grown very tired of it by the third morning. Based on the fact that the rates are mid-luxury, this ought to be addressed - also given that my wife is not an egg eater, her choices were far more limited.All in all, we would recommend the Archbishop and would likely stay there again.", "Date": "May 26, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR410875981", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Fantastic Mansion My wife and I stayed at the Archbishop's Mansion for three days and found it to be marvelous.

Whoever coined the legendary term - being waited on hand and foot - must have stayed a couple of nights at the Archbishop's Mansion. *Disclaimer: pardon the extreme corniness, but that's the best way to describe the place. It all began when I gave my girlfriend a Christmas gift to San Francisco. We stayed in Union Square the first two nights, then I picked out the Archbishop's Mansion for the remaining three nights. The plan was to spend the touristy days in the city itself, then experience the other side of San Fran in a more intimate setting.We could not have picked such a better place than the Mansion. Just walking in the foyer to check-in makes you feel that you are walking into a piece of early 20th century. The front person then gives you a tour of the Mansion upon arrival. Luckily, we got to have a cheap upgrade to one of the most magnificient rooms in the whole mansion - the Don Giovanni suite. This suite was out of this world! I do not know if I will ever in my life sleep on a $750,000 bed where the archbishop himself may have slept. Needless to say, it was not only beautiful, but very comfortable. There was a cozy fireplace, along with a wonderful bathroom complete with seven shower heads! Connected to the room was a grand living room-like parlor with its own fireplace and antique leather chairs. The breakfast was nice in the morning...however, if you are anything like my girlfriend and I, it was more like a wake-up snack. Nevertheless, it made us feel welcome in the mansion as we awoke from our deep slumber.Speaking of welcome, the service itself is first-rate! There is usually one person stationed in the front who operates as a jack-of-all-trades. I felt that they were genuinely interested in what we wanted to do in San Fran, and what places we would most likely enjoy. Incredibly, they would take care of ALL of our needs, from making making dinner reservations to bringing us hot tea. It was the best service I have ever encountered in any setting. A great story is needed here: my girlfriend and I are rabid Steeler fans, as is one of the staff members. After the Steelers dealt a fatal blow to the Bengals' playoff hopes, we were given a little suprise in our room: complimentary sparkling wine. I was in awe, in shock, and speechless at the generous gesture the staff at the Mansion did. Words of advice: if you are looking to stay in San Fran and experience the city, you are probably better off staying in the city itself. However, if you don't mind spending a little extra money on cabfare or a rental, it would be imperative to stay at the Mansion. I know for my girlfriend and I it added immensely to our overall experience and fondness for San Fran.", "Date": "Jan 12, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR480689564", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Mansion is far fetched.... My Husband and I stayed at the Archbishop's Mansion for 4 days on the second leg of our honeymoon. The Mansion itself, was very beautiful. The parlor area was nice, as was the dinning area and staircase. However, the rooms were not exceptional, especially for the price. First of all, the staff was very nice, very helpful for the most part. They seemed to take a genuine interest in what you had planned for the day/evening and if they could be of any help. And, especially if you are not from that area, make sure you ask THEM for directions and do not rely on YOUR map skills!!!The rooms were nice, but not exceptional. They, of course, were decorated in period antiques, however, I did not expect the bed to be part of the period antiques. You could probably get a better nights sleep on the floor, rather than these beds!!!! I prefer a softer bed, my husband prefers a firmer bed, either way, we had back problems from sleeping in these beds. They were too harsh for either of us!! I agree with other reviews in that the rooms needed updated. Not updated to the point you lose the feel of the Mansion, but updated to the point where wallpaper is not falling off the walls and the ceilings have been FULLY repaired.As far as the breakfast in bed, the first day it was nice, by the fourth, we were screaming for anything else, but the breakfast. Be prepared, the menu does not change from day to day. Room service consists of granola, somewhat fresh fruit, warm milk, strong coffee (even if you order the light roast), Yoplait yogurt (strawberry flavor only), store bought croissants, dry toast, etc. etc. Personally, I'm thinking, ok, a Mansion, well if we have ice for their wine, then surely they have kitchen facilities to cook?? Apparently this is not so. And don't always count on your order being correct, even if you did place it the night before!!Wine and cheese receptions were nice, but apparently, my husband and I were not the type of clientele they had in mind. WE were visiting San Fran for our honeymoon, I believe the other guests staying there were there for a nice little place to stop in and sleep and drop $250 for the room. In other words, seemed to me, most of the clientele were a little pretentious and snobbish.The area of town was not so great. I didn't feel comfortable at all in the area. I'm not sure if it was the weather (it rained the whole time), the Mansion, the side of town, what we were expecting, who knows? But we did not have that great of a time in San Fran. Like I said, it was nice, but I would not go back to the Mansion to stay again. I suppose we would have been alot happier closer to the action, especially considering we were there for four days. I'm willing to give San Francisco another try, but not the Archbishop's Mansion, especially at those prices. We had a lot better time, at a much more reasonable BB, where the menu did change, the wine and cheese receptions were longer and a lot more laid back in Santa Cruz!!!Overall, if I had to give this place a grade I would give it a C-.", "Date": "Jan 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR936450571", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Lawturtle"}, {"Content": "Very friendly staff, fun place to stay, nice and quiet       The upstairs hallway", "Date": "Oct 18, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR535695110", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Charming with Excellent Service, but Upgrades Needed We stayed at The Archbishop's Mansion for a weekend in October to celebrate a landmark birthday. It was a first trip to San Francisco, and I wanted to choose a place that was unique, special and memorable that my partner would always remember.We were booked into the Cosi fan Tutte suite, which disappointed me at first, as my preferences were for the Carmen or Gyspy Baron suites. However, after checking into the suite (and checking out the other two -- vacant rooms are usually left open for guests to inspect), I was very pleased with what we were given. It is a large, well-laid-out three room suite, decorated in Victorian antiques and prints. There are tall, bright windows (a charming window seat in one for reading), unique french doors separating the bedroom from the living room, a marble fireplace, a walk-in cedar closet, and a large bathroom. The room is furnished mostly in Victorian antiques.The dusty rose carpet, chintz curtains and striped wallpaper have a certain shabby-chic charm, but they are beginning to show signs of wear. Some of the upholstered pieces in the room definitely need redoing as well. The bathroom is not too attractive, with chipped floor tiles and a pretty basic tub/shower combination. I think Joie de Vivre should invest some money in the property and redo all of the carpeting, wall treatments and upholstery - perhaps in whites and neutrals -to give the property a more modern flair and to better showcase all of the impressive wood. However, I'm sure some people like it just the way it is.The Mansion is more like a very upscale bed and breakfast than a boutique hotel. There are only 15 rooms, and the staff (especially Heather and John) offer warm, friendly, personalized service. They really will go out of their way to fulfill a request or to make your stay more comfortable. The wine and cheese reception in the evening was a very nice touch, and the complimentary continental breakfast served to your room in the morning was of excellent quality. I am surprised, though, in a property so small that there is no evening turndown service.I'm not sure if we would stay at The Archbishop's Mansion on our next visit to San Francisco, though, just because it is not in a very convenient location, and for the price I think I would spend just a little more and stay at the Mandarin Oriental, the Ritz or the Clift.

Let's get the only possible negative out of the way immediately - location. If you are looking for something that is in the heart of the action then look for something around Union Square. The Archbishop's Mansion is centrally located so that you can walk to Haight Ashbury (20 minutes) or Union Square (30 minutes) but if not walking then count on a $12-15 taxi or the #5 bus, which is a block away. For those looking for an escape then the location could even be a plus.The mansion's rooms are all roomy, beautifully decorated and come with functioning fireplaces and one log per day. Our room didn't have a bath (nice clean shower stall with ample hot water and pressure - remember the Mansion is 100 years old).The hotel includes a terrific room service breakfast that is delivered at the time of your choice - great coffee, fresh - OJ / bread / fruit and granola. From 6 -7pm there is a complimentary wine  cheese in the main sitting room so make sure that your dinner reservations allow you to indulge. It is an opportunity to meet some really interesting and friendly people - or keep to yourselves if you prefer.Maybe the most positive aspect of the Mansion is the staff who went out of their way to accomodate our every wish. They also have a terrific knowledge of the city. If you want a world class hotel then there are plenty of choices among the typical chains.

The staff was pleasant but I would have to say that the manager was very condisending as noted in one of the other reviews. It reminded us of a spokey mansion, we decided to leave for another hotel after we went out for lunch just 3 blocks down the road the neighborhood did not seem safe. We may have been paranoid but decided quickly to get out of there. We ended up going to Hilton, it was cheaper and smelled much nicer. Sorry, but this was not my idea of romance.
