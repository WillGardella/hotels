We rode all over town looking for a place, having come into town on short notice without a reservation. With two small kids, both starting to get tired and hungry, we were thinking we were going to have to head for the peninsula. As we were driving through the Marina district, we saw this funky drive-under motor inn, with a vacancy sign, and figured -- \"why not?\" I went into the office, which was non-descript in a corner of the garage, and asked for a room. Suprisingly, the innkeeper told me \"We're full up!\". When I protested, and said \"There is a vacancy sign out there...\" She said -- \"Oh yes, I have some suites, but you probably wouldn't want one...\" I asked to see them and when I heard the amenities, I grabbed it immediately. Within minutes, we were inside the greatest little suites hotel I have ever seen! WE were told to park in the adjoining underground garage, where there were luggage carts near the elevator. We took the elevator to the top floor, and fond our suite. Upon opening the door, our jaws dropped. Separate bedrooms for the kids and us, each with a high poster bed. Wood floors, a kitchenette, and a full living room with a fireplace. Downstairs, the Marina District shopping district, with restaurants, bagel shops, Ben & Jerry's ice cream, and a wide range of other great places to go and see! Our kids still talk about this great hotel -- and we have talked it up to everyone we know. For others that have been there -- every time we mention this great little hotel we found in the Marina -- it's amazing how many other people exclaim the same name!", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverside, California", "Title": "\u201cvery clean and staff is very courteous\u201d", "Author": "1traveler2go", "ReviewID": "UR115063374", "Content": "Walked in to a clean room, carpet was clean, bathroom was clean, and no funky odors.

Well, the Suites are actually like renting a small condo that is serviced like a hotel room, and they are at least as comfortable as those offered by the large \"suites\" chains.

This is in the Marina, just down the street from our old house, so I know the area really well. But neither I nor any of my friends knew Cow Hollow Motor Inn had great apartments for rent, or a huge underground parking garage. We arrived Monday early afternoon, and they already had our suite ready, which was great since our babies were ready for a long nap. We had recently stayed at 3 different hotels on the east coast, including the Ritz in Philly, and no hotel could get the cribs in our room prior to our arrival, so we were so pleased to find the pack n plays already placed in our spacious apartment. Parking is covered, copious and free. There is a key-guarded elevator that goes right up to our floor; unfortunately, it stopped working Tuesday night and the front desk had no idea until I told them Weds morning, and it still wasn't working Thurs morning, so that's why only four stars for overall. But the pros of this place far outweigh the cons. The one bedroom was bright and spacious, with a big living room with fireplace. It was furnished with a large sofa, comfy chair, ottoman, flat panel TV, window seat and a desk in the corner. There is a fully equipped galley kitchen and a dining area for two adjacent. The bedroom has a king bed, flat panel TV, and large closet. The bathroom is spacious but not luxurious. There are hardwood floors and nice area rugs. My only complaint about Suite 141 is that the bedroom fronts Chestnut Street, and is therefore very loud. The buses continue to run past 1AM and deliveries on the street start before 5AM. But it was fine for our family of four in terms of space, but I couldn't sleep even with ear plugs. The room cost $235 per night, and I found out Tuesday morning that the two bedroom, two bath next door (Suite 142) was available and only $50 more! We moved right away. This apartment has an even larger living room that fronts Chestnut, but that's actually a bonus, a dining room with table for four, and full size kitchen. The guest bedroom has a queen bed but no TV. The master is very large with a king bed, flag panel, large walk in closet. The two baths are a bit smaller than in the one bedroom, but not a problem. It also has hardwood floors, a large coat closet, great furnishings (antiques and big cozy chairs), and the bedrooms are in the back. Suite 143 is also a two bedroom in the back, and 144 is a one bedroom in the back. I would suggest just avoiding the Suites 141 and (presumably) 241 upstairs.

That was overcome by the nice flatscreen in the living area complete with DVD player. But I like to watch Leno before I sleep! Rooms are kept spotless by staff, but trash under the sink when we checked in and one day, no one made up the room! Lots of towels, so no big deal. The guy who came up to empty the trash acted as though he was doing us a favor. No tip for you buddy! And of course, the requisite kids upstairs jumping off the bed or walls. We chalked it up to youthful exuberance, until it went on for an hour, then we called the desk. Problem solved. Finally, when I called to make my reservation I was told that an AARP discount of 10% would be applied. Of course, I never took a name, but upon checking in a matronly lady said quite curtly \"only AAA but that doesn't apply to the suites.\" Thank you very much. Again, no biggy, but every little aggravation seems to be amplified when you have certain expectations. Know what I mean?

The front desk now has all the charm of an airport ticket counter, with the same adversarial, hurried feeling. When I asked if anyone had even read our request for the 3rd floor, I was told with a shrug \"we are very popular now.\" When we checked out, I noticed many welcome bags on the back counter and got the impression that the hotel caters to groups and does not really care about individual travellers anymore. The rooms are reasonably sized but have gotten a little worn looking, with scuffed furniture, somewhat worn mattresses, and the occasional stains on the carpets.

Given the low price (<$100.00 / night) we were worried about this hotel located in a great area in a major American city. However, armed with excellent reviews by friends and family, we were very pleasantly surprised. Our room faced onto Lombard Street, and although we clearly could hear the traffic outside, it didn't keep us awake for a minute after long days of sightseeing in beautiful San Francisco. The free parking is a real bonus, especially for someone from a flat city who is a little intimidated by the San Francisco topography. The location is very central and located on excellent bus routes (recommend buying a metro pass to get around!) and close to great restaurants as well. Only a couple of blocks from Union Street, a great place for an afternoon beverage after hot days amongst other tourists. Great breakfast place right in the hotel, and very nice restaurants just around the corner. Overall, I will definately visit this hotel once again - it is good old-fashioned value for the money, not something you ALWAYS find in major North American cities (including my own).", "Date": "July 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson", "Title": "\u201cExceeded my expectations\u201d", "Author": "flygurl814", "ReviewID": "UR5427485", "Content": "We loved the Cow Hollow Motor Inn.
