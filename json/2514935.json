Pros: Room- Romantic Room with Garden View was perfect especially considering the price. The view was lovely, the room was quite spacious, and the bathroom was very modern and stylish with all the amenities i.e. shampoo etc. Location- In a rather posh (albeit lacking character) area near the Eiffel Tower. Walking distance to the cafes, the local supermarket, and of course the metro. Cons: Service was very hit and miss. The day-time receptionist woman really gives you the impression that she can't be bothered, but hey, she got the job done. Some staff were better than others. Internet- it's my fault really, as I didn't realise I had to leave the web browser tab of the log-in page OPEN while I use the net. Confusing nonetheless. The PC provided at reception was very slow, but the night staff was kind enough to make a phone call to the sister hotel across the street, just so I could use their printer.

After spending probably hours online (and on this site) trying to find the perfect place to stay in Paris, I settled on Hotel de l'Empereur. While it is a \"bit off the beaten path\" it is situated in an absolutely gorgeous part of Paris: next to Les Invalides, a short stroll from some cafes and the busier side of Paris near the Eiffel Tower. There is also a metro stop nearby making this 'walking city' a little more convenient to get around. The price was also very reasonable for Paris and I found it of good value. I arrived super early on a Saturday morning. Room was as expected not ready but was able to lock up the luggage in storage. Off to get a quick breakfast and do some more walking around then! Once I was able to check in, I really feel I lucked out. As a single traveler, I even had a great room on the second floor facing Les Invalides. The room and bathroom are small and tiny but so goes most of the hotels in Paris. For the price I paid I was quite happy though. The room was beautifully decorated; they must have renovated recently. Bathroom was clean and so was the room. Bed was comfy as well. The hotel is also 100% non-smoking which is GREAT for a non-smoker like me. But on a number of occasions, there was a smell of smoke that drifted up the stairwell from the lobby which I could smell in my room. I suspected it was people that actually stepped outside for a smoke and the smell just drifted in the front door, or, there was someone smoking elsewhere in the hotel either in another room or down in the lobby in a backroom or something. . .these were just theories I had but I couldn't find the source ultimately. This wasn't much of a huge issue. I did run into Catherine, the owner of the hotel/manager and mentioned it to her and she did take it quite seriously and after that encounter, never had an issue with the smoke again. Catherine was also most helpful and pleasant; she even helped out in an unfortunate situation as I was stuck with a 500 Euro note (money changer had given me one at my departure point) which is virtually impossible to get rid of in Paris short of going to a bank which, if you don't have an account with they won't break into smaller notes. Fortunately she came to the rescue. She runs a fine establishment and most all her staff is for pleasant and attentive. I would highly recommend this place: it is a quality establishment and has a great location (great restaurant next door). It may be away from some of the major sites but in all actuality you are not far from much in Paris.

Yes it was a small room - they are ALL small in Paris unless you have big coin! - but exquisitely styled and immaculate. We had a room on a corner of the hotel and pinched ourselves with joy at the beautiful view across the street to the glorious golden dome of Les Invalides. We opened that window to lean out and take in the view several times a day. The hotel itself also had quite a charming frontage adorned with brightly flowering cyclamens. The builtin wardrobe in the room seemed small but was big enough to pack away two suitcases of clothing as well as the cases, so the room wasn't cluttered. There was also a small desk where we had no problems using the wifi. The bathroom was very modern, also with a window (privacy blind) and heated towel rack. The hotel has one of those classic miniature lifts you get in all these old buildings in Europe - tiny but functional. The bed had plenty of pillows but was too soft for my back, and a waterproof liner on the mattress made it a tad sweaty at times. The room was immaculately cleaned each day. It was winter but the heating was excellent. There's no minibar and you aren't allowed to eat in your room (I didn't see this notice until the second or third day but hadn't been \"reported\" by the housekeeping staff for all the chocolate papers they must have found in the bin!) and it does breakfast but not dinner; however there are heaps of brasseries, pizza joints and restaurants in this area and if you walk 2 mins to the other end of the street which the hotel is on the corner of, there is a pretty good kebab shop. There's a small vending machine in reception for soft drinks and water but you're better off visiting one of the nearby supermarkets or convenience stores. The location was wonderful. The seventh is a very relaxed semi-residential area full of classical French apartment buildings. Real estate window shopping showed us you can easily pay a million or more for a decent sized apartment round here, and the shops reflect a comparable quality of life and gourmet tastes. In the evenings it is amazing how many dogs pop out of the apartments with their owners! The hotel is handy enough to metro stops to use these for arrival and departure transport, either pulling a suitcase or carrying a backpack, and for touristy day trips it's also easy walking distance to the Eiffel Tower, the Seine, Batobus stops, Place de la Concorde, and of course Les Invalides is right there. When we made our hotel booking (through a booking site) the hotel responded quickly with some useful tips for tourists, including an airport shuttle which we did book and which was very worthwhile for our arrival trip. The breakfast of 11Euro each is actually very good value (just check the board at any brasserie to compare!). You get a continental buffet - so baguettes, croissants, pain du chocolat, hot coffee, chocolate, tea, ham and cold meats, cheeses, butter and jams, toast, cereal, yoghurt, fresh fruit salad, fruit, and even boiled eggs - plenty to choose from and take your time to fuel up for the day ahead. Staff were pretty friendly - notably the housekeeping, who we ran into once or twice. Front desk staff were mostly very helpful as were the breakfast room staff - we just found it a little odd it is seemingly still ok to smoke in the kitchen, and stray fumes were a little offputting at breakfast.

By the way, we used their site to do the booking. That night, when we came back we were dealt with by a male receptionist for the check in\u2026only to be accused of being a thief. While the booking was confirmed on the website my credit card had initially had not been accepted. He tells me that I was lucky as they would normally cancel the booking because of the decline. We didn\u2019t fully understand what he was telling us as we had received an email with our payment going through and had put our correct mobile/email contact numbers if they needed to contact us. The night staff then insists that I pay the full amount for the stay upfront\u2026which of course I declined and said I would pay only once we check out (I let him take a small amount on my card to prove it worked\u2026) As previously mentioned I was disappointed by the size of the room, so the following morning I went to the reception desk to try and discuss the matter. I landed on the same receptionist from the previous day in the morning that I had first met at the hotel\u2026once again the lady was rude and not welcoming at all! I was bluntly told by the lady, that she did not care that if I was not impressed with the rooms and that if I was not happy that I could go elsewhere. I asked to speak to the manager of the hotel and was told \u201cWell, she\u2019s on holiday!\". I then requested the contact details of the manger so I could leave a message and was just instructed to us their main email (contact@..

When newly decorated, they are usually in boring corporate colours. This little gem shouts Versace when its superbly co-ordinated carpets, drapes and walls are in perfect rich black and gold harmony. I understand the other rooms have similar themes. I asked for a single room and as per previous Parisian visits I expected just that, a single bed with a tiny bathroom doubling as a closet. Can you imagine my surprise and bliss to be presented with an enormous king size bed, a huge bathroom and separate hallway and closet. Flat screen TV of big proportions on the wall complete the creature comforts. There are some really nice restaurants in the neighbourhood, most within a short walk. Taxi rank is 50 metres away, so is a metro station. This hotel is beautifully central, museums, Eiffel Tower all within a short walk away. And for all you English speakers out there who complain that Parisians are unfriendly and do not try to communicate in English, the hotel staff are almost all very fluent in English, are very helpful in arranging tours, explaining how the Metro and RER rail systems work etc. I felt so welcome in Paris for the first time ever and it is entirely due to the wonderful staff who tried so hard to please us in every way. The breakfast offered as an \"extra\" was really excellent. Bottomless coffee, juices and almost everything, fresh croissants and French bread from a local bakery - more than enough to last well into the day. Finally, when one finds a little gem like this, one is so tempted to keep the info all to one's self, so that it will always be available when one needs it, but indeed this would be selfish of me.

The area we stayed was a bit away from some of the major sites but that was not a big deal since you could travel the Metro which was right near the hotel. In fact some of the other areas were somewhat dirty and contained graffiti so we felt more relaxed and at times safer at our hotel. Within a very short distance we found a small grocery store (opened to 10pm) to purchase wine (bottles of wine around 4 euros or less) and cheese (sampled many different varieties with crackers) which we ate as a family every evening in the downstairs dining area. There is no eating in the rooms which at first was a little different but then you quickly realize it is a policy in place to maintain the quaility of the sleeping quarters. No one wants stains on the carpet or other areas of their room. There are also a few small cafe and restaurants within walking distance to eat all of the meals. Can not remember the name of one which was not worth going to (believe it was La Costa or something similiar it had red awnings); had bad food and prices were high, will try to review that later.

Based on our very pleasant experience at the Hotel de l\ufffdEmpereur, I'll definitely have to check out his suggestions in the future. The hotel on Rue Chevert worked out beautifully for a 5-night stay in late June. Our room on the 3rd floor faced an internal courtyard, so it was quiet. Though the room was a bit small, it was perfectly adequate for the 2 of us, and the twin beds were quite comfortable. The TV was useful for catching up on the news through CNN\ufffdand the air conditioning worked beautifully. We were delighted with the bathroom, which appeared to have been recently remodeled. It was large and had a wonderful shower with both a handheld shower head and a conventional showerhead with excellent water pressure and HOT water. Breakfast was served in a small room on the first floor, and it was just fine for our needs--coffee, tea and juices, hard-boiled eggs, toast, rolls and pastries, yogurts, cereal, etc. We found members of the hotel staff to be very helpful, painstakingly mapping out the Metro/train route for us to take to the Paris Air Show, helping us with the phone system, and offering restaurant suggestions. We spoke virtually no French, but they were patient with us. We were pleased to find a BNP Paribas Bank located within a couple of blocks of the hotel, as I'd previously learned that it's a part of the Bank of America Global Alliance and would charge no ATM access fees to B of A customers. I still expected to have to pay a conversion fee, but no fees ever turned up on my bank statement. Loved it! We really appreciated the hotel's location--across the street from Les Invalides, a couple of blocks from the LaTour-Maubourg Metro stop, and close to lots of cafes and restaurants. We headed for the Rue Cler pedestrian area for dinner a couple of evenings. We were surprised to find so many Americans there, but it was still a delightful place to walk and enjoy the twilight. The Rodin Museum was only a 5 minute walk from the hotel, and the Eiffel Tower was about 10-12 minutes away. We were surprised to find that we could even walk to the Louvre. The wide, tree-lined streets made for really pleasant walks, and the area seemed much more peaceful than other neighborhoods in Paris.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, comfortable room, but not safe from intruders\u201d", "Author": "Ann K", "ReviewID": "UR117072624", "Content": "We chose this hotel to be a little closer to the attractions in Paris that we wanted to see and to have a room with a/c since it was summer. It was a very nice room and although we didn't pay for a view, we got a room with a view of Hotel Invalides. The location was great, very close the metro, Rue Cler for breakfast, and about 15 minutes from the Eiffel Tower. I had read reviews of several hotels in Paris and remembered a different hotel that someone mentioned their room being broken into at night. So since our door didn't have a deadbolt lock, we put a suitcase under the handle so that it couldn't be turned down. Our very first night when we were jet-lagged, we woke up to the buzz of a key successfully unlocking our door and then someone tried the handle. However, we called out and they couldn't get the door open because of the suitcase. The hotel manager in the morning said it was the first time this had ever happened and gave us a new key. But we weren't satisfied with the excuses and explanations from her and other staff we spoke with. Every night after that we put our valuables in the room safe and moved our bed against the door so that it couldn't be opened. If it weren't for that, I'd give this hotel a great review because everything else about it was wonderful.

It's a newly renovated boutique hotel with Paris' typically tiny rooms and small lift, but the rooms are elegantly furnished (the overall look is one of sumptuousness, with reds and golds, heavy fabrics, luxurious padded headboards, etc) and the bathrooms are big and bright, with wonderful new showers that give you the option of hand-held or 'rainforest' sprays.The area is quiet at night, and there's double-glazing on the windows. Overall, I thought the hotel was excellent value for money. Our double, # 53, was very romantic, with a balcony and a stunning view of the gold dome of Les Invalides. The bed was the size of an American king or queen. There wasn't much space in the room itself for more than the bed-- a small desk, nightstands, and a closet were all that could fit -- but we slept wonderfully well. Our nephews shared a triple, #55, with three separate beds (two of which had been made from a double. The third was a roll-away bed, which, I must say, drew some complaints). Their room was much bigger than ours, with a view of the courtyard. If travelers need extra space, perhaps that line of rooms can be booked as doubles. The location itself is perfect for first-time tourists to Paris. We were there with nephews who'd never been to the city before, and so they wanted to take in all the big-name sites. Hotel de L'Empereur is within quick walking distance of the Eiffel Tower, the Seine cruises, Les Invalides, and the Grand and Petit Palais for art exhibitions. It's a minute from the market street of Rue Cler, 15 minutes from the Musee D'Orsay. It's a three-minute walk from the Metro and from a number of bus stops for lines that go straight into the heart of central Paris. That said, since we were there in August, when Paris really shuts down, we found the neighborhood itself less colorful and lively than, say, the Marais or St. Germaine area. Travelers should also be aware that the hotel is not a five-star property: there are no minibars or kettles in the rooms, the small lift means usually only 2-3 people can go up at once, there's only one computer for public use downstairs (and it always seemed to be occupied), though Wifi is free. The 11 Euro breakfast includes pastries, breads, ham, cheese, yogurt, fruit compote -- and what were supposed to be hard-boiled eggs, but were not! (You can imagine how we discovered this, even after asking). And items were not replenished. When we ate breakfast at 9 a.m., the croissants and bread ran out -- never to be replaced. This was one of the few drawbacks of the hotel. The other is that hotel policy requires guests to leave their key at the front desk, which is manned 24-hours. Once, however, we stood at the reception desk waiting for our key for at least ten minutes while the clerk ( a woman who did not appear to be a regular) spoke on the phone with a potential guest. We're not very picky about service, but her refusal to simply acknowledge that we were waiting struck us as impolite. Otherwise, however, the reception staff was TERRIFIC. We were given an extremely warm welcome and plenty of assistance during our stay. Every time we needed something -- directions, taxi reservations, help with the rooms -- the rest of the staff was friendly, kind, and prompt. We were comfortable at Hotel de l'Empereur, we were well-rested, and we were generally impressed. We would definitely stay there again.

The hotel is set on a quiet street less than 200 meters from the nearest Metro station, La Tour Maubourg, located near to Hotel des Invalides and a 10 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower. A small hotel, as the other reviews highlight the hotels room standards in my opinion exceeded the current two star grading. We booked a double room with a street view and were delighted with our fourth floor room which afforded a view of Hotel des Invalides and its golden dome, which when illuminated at night was simply stunning. The room was modern and spotless with a modern showeroom. A hairdryer, flat screenTV and safe was provided. The photographs on the Hotel web site and those provided by fellow travellers accurately depict the rooms. On arrival at the hotel the reception staff were helpful and friendly . A buffet breakfast was available in the hotel that was reasonably priced by Paris standards however we opted to eat in one of the many cafes as we travelled through the city. We flew into Charles De Gaulle and took the train and Metro into the city, cost about 18 euro for the both of us. One tip if you have a Blackberry is to down load the Paris Metro app which worked out the shortest and quickest route detailing the stations to change at and connections. This was really helpful and simplified our travel. The ticket machines are in English and one ticket covered both the airport train (RER) and Metro. We also purchased the museum pass that covered all the main attractions buying this at Hotel des Invalides were the queues were the smallest. The Eiffel tower we went up at 11pm again smaller queues. River cruise also recomended. A thing to watch out for is a gold ring con, we came across this twice easy way to avoid it is if anyone offers you a \"gold ring\" they have \"found\" simply do as we did and walk away.

L'Empereur was 5 euros cheaper, but they are on the same street, similar decor, both quiet, both modern decor, tvs. Actually, I would rate l'Empereur higher than Muguet, because the bedroom and bathroom were bigger, with a rainfall shower, whereas Muguet had a much smaller room and shower. Both had good towels and bedding as well. I can vouch for the air conditioning working well also - it was a record warm temperature for April and the room was cool enough for sleeping. Both are just around the corner from La Tour Mauborg metro station, and also near l'Ecole Militaire station as well. Fun shopping and cafes along Rue Cler as well. my only complaint (and a minor one) is that the shower is one of those that doesn't really have a lip, so the water tends to get on the floor, but that's a very small complaint. (for the record, while la Bellechasse is clearly a notch above these two, it's also 150 euros more a night, and our room only had a hand-held shower). I would save your money and stay here instead. Also - skip the breakfast at all 3 - not worth the money. Buy a pain au chcolate at a local bakery and a piece of fruit instead!", "Date": "April 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGreat but for the lack of a latch on the door\u201d", "Author": "adriennewu", "ReviewID": "UR99604915", "Content": "My friend and I spent 4 nights at this little gem of a hotel in Paris.

So, with that out of the way, let me say that we enjoyed our stay at the Hotel de l'Empereur very much. The staff was friendly; we had a very nice room, the hotel allowed free Internet access with their computer, we enjoyed the breakfasts. No complaints. We wanted to stay here during our entire trip to Paris but had to change hotels. If there is anything negative to say, it doesn't concern the hotel, but the area. We stayed in this hotel because it was in the area near Rue Cler for two reasons: (1) The Rue Cler is highly recommended by Rick Steves of public television fame; (2) when it was necessary to change hotels, we had to walk only a few blocks. We plan to return to Paris in June and my husband would like to stay at this hotel again. My hesitation is that the Rue Cler is a little out of the way for most tourist destinations. There are shops, restaurants, laundromats you can walk to (very important to us), and friendly staff at the local post office. This area has the Eiffel Tower, Rodin Museum, and Napoleon's Tomb nearby. However, the Metro requires changes to get to the most desired travel destinations and some of the transfers went on and and on down long halls and up stairs, etc. There were times when I felt that I had walked under half of Paris. As I have said, we have no complaints about the hotel.

With Napoleon's tomb and Invalides close by (with stunning views too), and a metro with great links 2 minute walk away, we found it ideal. It's a quiet area too. The room was lovely. Newly decorated, everything was really nicely finished, and extremely comfortable. I paid for a room with a view, and champagne waiting for us to arrive (30e / bottle) which was there, chilled and ready when we arrived. The view is excellent - worth it for those nights sat with Champagne, or mornings looking out. We we're on the 5th floor and had a small balcony, which doors opened out on too. Perfect to stand and watch the world go by. Room has hairdryer, free safe box, and basic toiletries. The bathroom was spacious with modern fittings, and had a large shower. The beds are large, and very comfortable with extra bedding in wardrobe. We slept extremely well. Heating can be controlled in room with ac, and our room was a good size too (especially for Paris). Wifi is available throughout the hotel for free. You just have to get the password off reception, and get them to set an account up. It was fast, but does require login each time you connect. Reception always helpful. Didn't have breakfast so can't comment on that. We preferred to wonder down the road and find a local patisserie or cafe. Lift is small but fits three and a suitcase.

The hotel has always been suitable and quite adequate for our needs - quiet and clean and a great location. On this occasion we were travelling with our son and daughter in law and 3 year old grandson. We specifically choose this hotel as we felt it would be better than others we have stayed at because we had a 3 year old with us. Our flights had taken us across Canada and then transatlantic to Paris. The two nights I had booked at this hotel were to allow us to rest prior to carrying on to the south of France. I had booked on line and by telephone in October 2009. When we arrived at the hotel about 10:00 am he woman at the front desk said \" there will be noise from 9 to 12 and 1 to 3, is that okay? Well it wasn't - we had been in transit since 1:00 pm the previous day. We were exhausted from our long flights. We felt we didn't have any choice at that point. The hotel was essentially gutted on all but the top floor and the first floor of rooms. The top floor rooms may all have been finished. Our family's room was on the top floor and it had been redone and was very nice. Their hallway was still in a state of renovations - dusty and looked like work space. The staircase had been stripped of carpet and had not been redone. There didn't appear to be any temporary lighting in the stairwell. At times the construction workers used the elevator to move their equipment. The winch that took construction materials to the upper floors was just outside the window in my room but it didn't really matter as the jack hammers were louder than the noise of the winch. There was major work underway. The woman at the desk identifed herself as the new manager/owner ( she said as of Jan 2010) Later that morning I talked with her - she was completely indifferent - no apologies for the noise nor adjustment to the bill - she just kept repeating that she had told us when we checked in that there would be noise. Perhaps I'm being to naive to suggest that hotel guests should be advised in advance of this type of conditions - or more to the point, I think the hotel should have been closed for the duration of the work. The hotel seemed more like a construction sight with a few rooms than a hotel with \"renovations\" taking place. After checking in I went for a walk to find alternate accommodation in close proximity but stopped after three hotels as there was nothing available - particularly in our price range. On a couple of other points: the bed in our room had a rubber sheet as the mattress cover. It was noisy and hot to sleep on. We took it off. The bill as presented at check out was 5 Euros higher on one room than what was confirmed by email.That felt like insult to injury. This has since been adjusted. I have been to Paris several times and yes - I often think of my hotel room as a providing a place to sleep while I explore the fabulous city during the day. That being said there is always a day or two of adjustment for jet lag or the need for other quiet time when I expect a hotel room to provide respite during the day. I can't recommend this hotel - I didn't get value for the money and the owner was rude and indifferent.", "Date": "June 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cA perfect spot in Rue Cler\u201d", "Author": "Guinett", "ReviewID": "UR61246280", "Content": "We came to Paris for a week and were so happy to be in this hotel in the Rue Cler neighborhood.

Plus, we took the metro every single day so it saved us tons of time and made it easy to stop for a quick nap or bathroom break. Other positives are: It's extremely quiet. The staff speaks enough English to make communication easy. There's a completely affordable breakfast buffet for the times we just needed a quick bite before starting the day. All you can eat cereals, pastries, croissants, coffee, teas, and juices. Plus, it's blocks away from rue Cler, a cute & quaint little street w/ markets, cafes & shops for everyone. Be sure to grab a wonderful breakfast from Cafe du Marche! The only conceivable downside (as noted in many other reviews) is that the room was small. Not uncomfortably small, but just-enough-room-for-everything small. Our room had a full size bed for 2, closet, night stand, small desk, 2 chairs, & a television, as well as a connected bathroom w/ a toilet, sink, bidet & bathtub w/ sprayer attachment. A perfect place to spend unwind after long treks around the city and take a nice bath to relax. If you're one of those people that likes spending entire days kicking it in your hotel room then this might not be the place for you. But if you're looking for a clean, safe, comfortable, close spot to stay while you spend your time enjoying the city of lights, book a room here while you still can. As an added tip: be sure to buy your Paris Visitor Pass for the Metro on Expedia weeks before you go. It will save you tons of money if you plan to see a lot of the city as well as avoiding language barrier problems. Just print up the voucher and follow the directions.
