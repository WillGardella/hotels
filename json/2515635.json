It was awesome to watch the kids loved it!! The only inconvenience is that there is NO newstand or small convenient store inside, like most casinos... and NO snack vending machines.

Since our last stay they have built a Bass Pro Outdoor World next to the hotel, which was definitely a deciding factor for one of us! And I was persuaded away from my dreams of the Venetian when I saw details of their lodge-style suites online. Although we could see details of the suites on the internet, when we tried to book online it would never give any availability for suites on Friday or Saturday so we had to telephone the hotel. They don\u2019t have many suites and it turns out that they can\u2019t be booked for a weekend unless the Revenue Manager agrees to release one. It took several phone calls and e-mails but eventually we were able to book the week we wanted. The hotel has large amounts of car parking including an attached parking garage. It wasn\u2019t especially busy during our stay so we always found a space fairly close to the hotel in the surface car park. As with most casino hotels, you have to trek through the casino in order to find the reception. There is no way to avoid this and it is extremely annoying, especially when you\u2019re checking in or out and have your luggage with you. Our suite was on the 3rd floor overlooking the pool area, although the view was pretty much blocked by palm trees. The suite was just as we\u2019d seen on a YouTube video. It\u2019s double the size of a standard room with one half being the bedroom with bathroom and Jacuzzi, and the other half being the living room and \u2018kitchen\u2019. The bedroom had a king bed, a desk and chair one side of the bed and a bedside cabinet at the other side, a comfy armchair and a cabinet containing the TV with drawers underneath, and a kind of footstool/bench. The Jacuzzi divided the bedroom and bathroom areas. The bathroom area had a good sized storage closet and a large vanity with double sinks. The toilet and shower were in a separate room. The towels were soft and fluffy, there was a good selection of Bath & Body Works toiletries, tissues and a box with cotton wool balls and cotton buds in it. There was also a hand held hair dryer, in a bag. In the wall between the bedroom and living room were 2 wooden framed windows. The living room had a sofa, an armchair, coffee table and several other tables. A large flatscreen TV was on one wall, and there were several freestanding lamps. There was a large potted tree in the living room, and another in the bedroom. There were 3 stools at a breakfast bar which divided the living room from the \u2018kitchen area\u2019. Although the \u2018kitchen\u2019 was a good size it was not fitted out as a kitchen. It had a small sink, just designed for rinsing glasses I think. It had 2 full countertops, in addition to the raised bar area, and several cupboards and drawers. In one cupboard was the safe and in another was the mini-bar. There was no separate fridge and no room in the mini-bar for guests to store their own items. On the counter was a coffee-maker on a tray with polystyrene cups and coffee supplies; also an ice bucket and glasses. There was also a tray containing the edible mini-bar supplies, eg chips, chocolate, peanuts. There was a lot of wasted space in the \u2018kitchen\u2019 and whilst I personally would not have made use of a fully equipped kitchen, it would have been nice to have had a fridge to keep basic supplies in. It was quite frustrating not to have this facility, especially when there was so much room available. The whole suite was extensively decorated in lodge or cabin style, with plenty of pictures, mirrors, lamps and lights, and other decorative items including a stag\u2019s head and fishing equipment, even a faux tin ceiling in the \u2018kitchen\u2019 area. It was very well done, more so than I had expected. One of the things which attracted us to the Silverton was the range of bars and eateries listed on their website. However, although aware that smoking is allowed within the casino, we hadn\u2019t realised that all the bars open onto the casino floor so it was impossible to sit and have a drink anywhere smoke-free, other than in a restaurant, and also everywhere had the noise from the casino. So we weren\u2019t able to spend any time sitting and enjoying a quiet drink as we had planned. We ate in the 24-hour Sundance Grill twice; the food was good but the service extremely slow. We had planned to eat in the Twin Creeks Steakhouse but when we arrived there at 5.30pm \u2013 admittedly without a reservation but it was very early evening on a weekday, only 30 minutes after it opened \u2013 and despite what appeared to be a virtually empty restaurant, we were told it would be 3 hours until a table was available. So we got in the car and headed elsewhere. Another day we decided to have breakfast at the buffet only to find that it doesn\u2019t offer breakfast on weekdays, despite information to the contrary in the room guide. Again, we got in the car and went elsewhere. We pretty much intended to eat and drink mostly in the hotel for the 7 nights but in fact only had the 2 meals there and ended up spending our money elsewhere. That was quite disappointing. The housekeeping staff were friendly and helpful; reception staff not particularly welcoming or friendly. The hotel charges a resort fee which I know is a contentious issue in Las Vegas but we knew about it when we booked and just accepted it as part of the overall nightly cost. To be honest, I couldn\u2019t see what you actually get for the resort fee, especially given that it was doubled for a suite. Supposedly it was for the fitness centre, which we didn\u2019t even see let alone use; local phone calls, which again we didn\u2019t use (although I was charged $15.00 for one very short phone call to California, which seemed excessive even at hotel rates); and a shuttle to the Strip which only ran 4 times a day and for which space was limited so you could easily find yourself having to pay return cab fare. When I wanted to check-in online for our return flights my only option was to use the one computer terminal in the phone area near reception which cost 25c/minute, minimum $5.00, plus extra to print boarding cards. It was fun to have the Outdoor World attached to the hotel, to be able to pop in for a look around without having to step outside. We liked the lodge theming of the hotel, especially in our suite. There were absolutely no extra perks with the suite except the extra space, which seemed a little odd somehow \u2013 usually a suite, particularly somewhere with so few suites, does warrant some extras even if only complimentary soft drinks, or priority restaurant reservations. The lack of a fridge was very inconvenient and again seemed odd for a suite when many ordinary hotel rooms now have one. We enjoyed the theming and space of the suite but other than that our stay wasn\u2019t at all special. Not being able to enjoy a quiet drink in the hotel was disappointing, as was the limited availability of eating options other than the 24-hour grill. I don\u2019t get the impression that the Silverton is overly concerned about attracting repeat visitors to their accommodation (the casino is presumably their priority). Although I\u2019m sure the proximity to Outdoor World will always be a temptation (!), I think we\u2019ll probably stay elsewhere on our next visit to Las Vegas.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cfor the money not bad\u201d", "Author": "marandmott", "ReviewID": "UR127802739", "Content": "In vegas to visit daughter, we decided to stay off the strip so we didn't have to deal with the hassle of traffic.

This overcame the GA nature of the venue which meant even if you paid your money, you weren't guaranteed a seat. Still, a great show in what turns out to be an average size hotel ball room.

On the positive side, the rooms were clean, roomy and very quiet. In fact, the insulation was fantastic and with a room fan on, we never heard noise from adjoining rooms or people in the hallways. The beds were soft and very comfortable, and they give you plenty of pillows. The bathroom was a little cramped for two people, but had plenty of counter space, and they supply you with an abundance of towels and wash cloths. Water pressure was great and the temperature was hot and consistent. The only major drawback was the ceiling fan did not work, so things got very steamy and no way to clear the mirrors efficiently. We did have one scare when some terrible gurgling noises occurred in the bathroom and we went in to find water backing up in the sink. We called the front desk and they sent a maintenance crew up, but the water went down on its own and they seemed to think they had a larger problem affecting the entire wing, not just our room. No harm, no foul, but we kept things up off the floor just in case. We did notice repaired water damage on our ceiling and wall where they've apparently had plumbing issues in the past, but again, there was no real inconvenience to us. This is a typical casino/resort set up, so you have to maneuver through a myriad of gambling just to get to the front desk and of course you must drag your luggage throught the same maze in order to get to your room. I understand the design philosophy of casinos, but that doesn't make it less annoying when you are road-weary and just want to quietly get to a bed. However, the most irritating part of our visit was twofold: 1) Hidden \"resort fees\" that they tack on to your billing. About $5/day, which ostensibly gives you access to the pool, the workout room, local calls, etc. These are all things which \"normal\" hotels simply provide in the room base price, so why not adjust the room rates accordingly rather than hitting guests with hidden fees? That is poor business practice in my opinion. 2) They provide WiFi capability, but only for an additional fee of $10.99/day. Simple internet service, which is pretty much a free standard for decent hotels across the planet, is a premium-priced luxury at the Silverton. I have to admit, that irritated me a lot. But not to worry--the Starbucks in the downstairs casino is true to that company's form--they offer free WiFi, so we used Starbucks instead. Still very aggravating to be unable to handle emails/etc from the comfort of your room without paying an extortion price.

Dessert selection was probably the most uninspiring I have ever come across. Other than that... The Silverton is a beautiful casino set a short distance from the strip. It's not much of an inconvenience as the hotel offers a great little shuttle that brings you to and from center strip at Caesars Palace. If a cab is desired to return to the Silverton then its a $20 bill. Considering the cost difference between staying at a strip hotel or the silverton, the $20 cab ride is excellent. We found the strip can be on the stressful side, particularly on this trip, and the Silverton provided an excellent sanctuary to retreat to in the evenings. The rooms were clean, spacious, and very comfortable. House keeping was perfect and quite friendly. The pool was perfect. It's small but has great ambiance to relax with a drink, listen to really great rock music which was piped in through garden speakers, and chat up other guests. The attached Bass Pro Shop is an fantastic destination to spend some time. Outdoors-men or not... This place will amaze everyone, so be sure to check it out! As far as gaming, although we were non winners this trip, the Silverton allowed us to play long periods of time on our dollars as opposed to the cash Black Holes of the giant strip hotel casinos.

Most of the strip pools are designed for 20 somethings with a cold beer in their hands with trunks half off. This pool was sooo relaxing with a nice hot tub too. A couple of nice girls (with major tatoos) to bring you drinks if you want. There were only 4-6 people at the pool at any one time and soft rock music. All of the 10 or so cabanas were unoccupied, and the price was reasonable if you want one for the day. We love Silverton. We had been to their casino a few times before buy never stayed there, and had a free room offer due to our play. I am happy we stayed there. We ate at the cafe twice because the buffet line was very long with locals. The breakfast and dinner we had were second to none. We paid with our points, and the steak and shrimp special with dessert was only like $14.99. One day while my wife shuttled her parents over to M Resort, I played all morning and ate at Johnny Rockets and devoured a huge burger and chocolate malt--pure heaven. I did win at the casino, getting a $1,600 W-2 on Cave Man Keno and hitting many smaller jackpots on four card Keno. Very nice atmosphere with continuous drink service. My wife won big on a penny machine called \"Tarzan.\" She bought me shirts at the on site Bass Pro shop, which is very nice. I loved their big tanks equipped with Mermaids also.

No food is worth that even if it is free. After a while we finally decided that one person would stand in line and then 4-8 people would then come up and get in line with them. That is not the Silverton's fault....just rude customers. We went to Johnny Rockets and the food and service was great. We would probably return to the Silverton.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westminster, Ca", "Title": "\u201cCozy and Convenient\u201d", "Author": "BeatleB", "ReviewID": "UR117252225", "Content": "The location is good and it has all the amenities.

It had been a few years since the last time we had been to Vegas. We wanted to avoid the crush of tourists on the strip, so we booked 2 rooms at the Silverton Hotel & Casino, just outside of the strip. We were greeted warmly and were checked in quickly. Since my parents have some mobility issues they were able to accomodate them by making sure their rooms were closest to the elevator. Once there the rooms were very clean and the bedding was very comfortable, there was also a safe in the room which is always appreciated. The rooms have mini-bars and a snack tray with all sorts of goodies and CDs, but I'm sure it cost a pretty penny, so we didn't touch any of the items. The rooms were cleaned daily and the hotel staff always greeted us when they saw us. The hotel does have free WIFI, but it is only in their lobby area. The lobby area has very comfy leather chairs and there are electrical outlets behind the couches on the wall. Don't feel odd searching for outlets, there are other guests doing the same thing. The gym was smaller than I expected, it is not inside the hotel itself, you have to exit the hotel by a back door, walk down between the buildings and at the end of the building is the entrance to the gym. You have to have your room card with you. Towels are provided in the gym and there is a water cooler with paper cups. They have treadmills, ellipticals, and free wieghts. I noticed they also had mats and a couple of TVs. The restaurants at the hotel were nice. The buffet was plentiful and at the time they had a drink special, buy a souvenir beer glass for $5 get unlimited refills. Being the holidays, the staff was on top of bussing the tables, refilling drinks and keeping the line moving quickly. We also ate at the mexican restaurant at the hotel--there is only so much buffet you can handle in a week. The entrees seemed a bit pricey, but we wanted something different. The food was typical mexican/american fare, nothing spectacular. Afterwards we walked over to the gelato stand and had yummy gelatos. There's also a diner next to the gelato stand, which we also ate at, we were there for a whole week so yes we sampled a lot of what the Silverton had to offer. The diner was really nice, most importantly, our drinks and meals arrived promptly, refills were plentiful, and our server was very courteous. We also did a bit of shopping at the Bass Pro Shop, it was a nice distraction while waiting for the mermaid show to start in the huge tank, by the Mermaid Lounge. Overall, we really enjoyed our time here and would definitely recommnend it for anyone looking to stay in the Vegas area, but not on the strip.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cA GEM IN THE DESSERT\u201d", "Author": "Sentinel19", "ReviewID": "UR112800249", "Content": "What a nice little gem in the dessert located just off Dean Martin Drive, south and west of the Strip (15 minutes from center Strip).

If Yosemite had a casino, this would be it. The casino was very clean and was well maintained. Most of the tables have low $5 limits (getting harder to find on the Strip). Five dollar table limits in a really nice environment are a breath of fresh air. The air in the casino has a low smoke content. My wife and I played craps and Ultimate Texas Holdem and even $3, yes $3, blackjack (21). Cocktail service was often and the drinks are large and tasty. Make sure you sign up for their players card. They give you $5 credit at the slots and also a coupon for a free buffet when you sign up. We used the free buffet coupons the following day for the Friday night seafood buffet ($46 dollar value).

It's okay, you can admit it. You don't have to say you go there for the shows or clubs. I love the Silverton casino as it has an abundance of the type of machines and tables that my husband and I enjoy. There are plenty of triple multi-denomination Game King machines where you can sit and play various games at your leisure. If you like Mexican food, there's a nice restaurant right inside the casino. The cocktail waitress comes by often and returns quickly with your beverage. There's a Starbucks, and Italian food eatery, Johnny Rockets (which you can order a big, delicious hamburger, take it to your room and watch TV for a break in the action). The parking log/garage is free and is close to the hotel unlike the strip hotels where one must walk quite a distance to even reach the door. So, what are the \"needs improvement\" areas? Well, they do charge a \"resort fee\" (this time $8.50 a night). I highly resent these fees. I'm not sure what services they provide---none in my case, as I leave housekeeping a personal tip anyway. Secondly, there is no in-room coffee. So, you have to get dressed, go down to Starbucks, pay $$2.00 for a coffee and go back to your room. Thirdly (and this is only in some cases), don't stay on any floor except the fourth. That way, you won't have anyone stomping around at night and early in the morning. This is the first time, I have had this problem, but I won't let it happen again. When asked if \"everything was all right,\" when we left, we informed them that, no, it wasn't. We were given a little sympathy and some advice to request the top floor, but no monetary refund. I wish there were the perfect hotel in Vegas, but there just isn't.

The rooms were spacious and mostly nicely maintained. The hair dryer was broken in our room but when we informed the front desk they brought another one right up. The bathrooms were a little small and they unfortunatly had wall paper in them so it was peeling. The new trend for hotels is no coffee pots, refrigerators or microwaves unless you pay extra for them. I feel that if they call them luxury rooms these things should be included. They have wonderful pillow top beds with thick duvets and great pillows. I have a hard time sleeping in most hotels but these beds are fantastic. I slept like I was in my own bed. There is a Starbucks in the casino if you want coffee or a variety of restaurants. We tried the Mexican Cantina and I was very disappointed in my meal (pork chimi - tasted rancid) and could not eat it. They were very nice about removing the cost from our bill. The chips and salsa were great and the hubby's fajita's were good. The Italian fast food was ok but not great. The food had been sitting for awhile and was tough, the marinara tasted ok but was watery. Their menu also displayed a green garden salad but it was not available to order. They\" didn't serve that there\". Then why was it on the menu? We loved Johnny Rockets the 50's style hamburger joint. The food was great, fresh and hot! The manager was friendly and the service was fast. We didn't get to all their restaurants or bars. There is a large variety to choose from depending on your style and tastes. I would recommed that management kick the food up a notch in the Mexican Cantina and the Italian fast food. There is a large aqarium in the lobby that has live Mermaids several times a day. This seems to be a huge hit with all the children(and all the men) and a lot of locals come to see them. If you are an outdoor enthusiast this hotel is really for you. There is a Pro Bass retail store of humongous proportions connected to the hotel. We are not outdoorsy people but we found ourselves shopping in the store several times during our stay. Clothes, guns and equipment, you name it they have it. An indoor gun range, archery room, waterfalls stuffed animals galore all inside a beautiful lodge style store. This lodge style hotel goes perfectly with the store. There is ample parking and it's very easy to get to off exit 33 on I15. We have stayed on the strip before and hated the constant parking hassel. Parking here was a breeze. I love to work out and was extremely pleased with their fitness room. It was large and clean with a nice selection of machines and weights. Towels and water were provided. There were several televion sets for viewing while working out. It was a pleasant surprise. They have a nice pool with cabanas and tables. Unfortunatly it was too cool to swim during our stay.

I'd say that if you make limited trips to Las Vegas or this is a first stay--I'd recommend someplace on the strip--if not, and you're looking for a great place with good value, great restaurants and some of the best and most friendly service in town--you can't go wrong with the Silverton! Why? Let me tell you-- #1--Shuttle service to airport and strip. They have a shuttle that will pick you up and return you to the airport. (No strip hotel will do this unless you're a high roller!) Just wait at the entrance by the aquarium at the scheduled time and the friendly bus driver will pick you. If you're arriving--let the reservations person know that you want to be picked up and s/he will schedule it for you! #2--Great restaurants and you can use your points that you earn on your slot card towards your food! From Mexician to buffet to gourmet--Silverton has it covered. AND they're all good and all resonably priced too! #3--Nice rooms, VERY clean and not a long walk! The rooms at the Silverton are nice--I'd say a bit up from a Holiday Inn. The bathrooms are smallish but everything is clean, clean, clean! They also stock Bath and Body products in the bathrooms! But the best part is that the rooms aren't \"miles\" and \"miles\" away from the casino, parking or restaurants like some of the big strip hotels where you walk down the hallway to your room and you think you're almost there and well-- you know what I mean. Also, the rooms are very reasonably priced and if you play in the casino on your Player's card even a little bit they'll send you offers for very reduced rates or even free! #4--Great service. Some of the best drink girls, slot personnel bartenders and waitress/waiters I've ever had the pleasure of being served by! #5--Bass Pro Shops--A Bass Pro shop is attached to the Silverton and points earned on Player's card can be redeemed for gift certificates here. #6--Promotions and Specials -- The Silverton is always running dining, food, buffet slots and other promotions. Check them out on their web page -- http://www.silvertoncasino.com/ The above are just some of the reasons that we enjoy the Silverton but you'll have to try it for yourself.

The walk-in price they charged was extremely high, $159.00 a night for Saturday for a hotel that is located far from the Strip. The $59 for Sunday was fair. I think the worst part was that they indicated that this was the best rate available, no AAA rate discount and little assistance when we asked for the business center to see if we could access a better rate online. As we were having car trouble, we had little choice as to where we could stay. After checking when I arrived home, I found that weekend rates were available for $65 on Saturday, and $49 on Sunday.

We are Hilton Honors owners and know we can depend on service, facilities, and amenities. This year we came to the new Silverton Hotel because owner Ed Roski is a good man and major contributor in our community. Checked in May 2, 2010. Appeared to be very nice, small, quiet, off the strip. Just what we need for R & R. After dinner we went to casino to play. Having a nice evening. At 10:pm a wave of sewer stink filled the Casino-and it was bad! We were at Flare Bar and I felt sorry for the bartender and waitress\u2019s who were moving about the floor with napkins and hands to their noses. It was so bad I dry heaved several times before dashing to the restroom to throw up. Needlesss to say my night was over. Staff was walking through floor trying to spray freshener but the stench was to strong. People were holding their noses and we were all complaining to each other. I went directly to front desk to talk to the hotel manager only to find that there is none on duty. I was told \u201c\u2026there were major staff cuts and we have no manager\u201d. I was directed to a pit-boss who apparently is in charge of the whole hotel at night\u2026.this is at 10:30pm. Pit boss knew the stench and was very understanding. He was receiving all the complaints, doing the best he can with staff and people. He knew how bad it was. He said \u201c\u2026I have already called my manager and alerted them of the problem\u201d. I ask for the manager to call me about my complaint so I gave the pit boss my card and room number. He diligent took all the information down and said he would pass it on to the manager to contact me in the morning. 12:noon-no one called me. I had to go down to the lobby to follow-up myself. Again at the front desk, apparently there is still no hotel manager on duty in the house. Talked with that supervisor, but she had no authority to follow up on my complaint, or give me answers. She went in back to call the hotel manager?? Call where, where is this person? Where is anyone in charge?? She came back and said I could speak with Mike Smith, Supervisor. Mr. Smith was cordial and listened to my complaint. He explained again the \u201cManager\u201d is off on certain days. Explained the stench was in fact sewer stench. I asked about complaints, and his comment was that mine was \u201c\u2026the only complaint about the incident that we received\u201d. I said that was a lie because the pit boss took complaints, the desk took complaints, and the staff was all suffering. It is illogical that mine would be the ONLY complaint. Bottom line I complained I lost a night of entertainment..and he gave me a complaint form to fill out saying there is nothing more he could do. While Mr. Smith was cordial, he was not helpful and I felt like he had no real authority to do anything or make any decisions.

Breakfast was \"ok\", the coffee shop was nice, the food didn't taste as good as the breakfast I had at \"Orleans\" or \"Arizona charlie's\" on Dekature, The only negative thing I can say about \"Silverton\" is that it has this outdoorsy, country type of feel, and they had just had George Jones there the night before, Charlie Daniels was coming, so my wife and I being country fans thought it would have a completely \"country\" feel to it, but we were very disappointed at the music they played the whole day we were there was some kind of bad \"Pop\" sounding stuff, it wasn't bad out in the casino because it wasn't as loud, but in the coffee shop it was so loud it really interferred with breakfast.

Had 3 rooms booked, one for my parents, one for my brother, and one for my husband and I. Pros: Beautiful huge lobby, stunning massive aquarium, Pro Bass Shop is incredible, casino is large but not large enough to get lost, casino had lots of game choices, beds were very comfortable with nice linens, toiletries products were very nice, rooms bigger than average and room decor was nice. While playing slots, cocktail waitress were around constantly taking free drink orders....that was nice. The \"Twin Creeks\" Steakhouse is exceptional, one of the nicest dinners we have ever had out, excellent staff, food was amazing....but be aware it is closed Sundays and Mondays. Check in was friendly as was the little souvenir shop's clerk. A large convenient Starbuck's is located in the hotel, as well as a pizza/hamburger place that was impeccably clean and had inviting, friendly staff. Casino ventilation was quite good so it never got too smokey. Cons: Complained to housekeeping 1 minute upon entering room because bathrooms were actually DIRTY....toilets were dirty, garbage in garbage can, etc. All three bathrooms were not in good shape, needed recaulking around toilet, new grout on floor tile work, shower/tubs were dingy and the floor of the showers were very slimy....ICK! Floors are uneven in areas which is quite strange. The \"Sundance Grill\" restaurant was so bad it was ridiculous; from unfriendly boring staff to terrible food quality! Seasons Buffet for the Sunday Bellini Brunch was nice, but for regular during the week buffet breakfast it was pathetic (no eggs, bacon, sausage, french toast, or other traditional breakfast foods, but instead egg rolls, salad, pizza, perhaps not what you want before 10am?)....buffet was VERY grubby, food subpar. Alcoholic drinks throughout the entire hotel and casino were outrageously priced ($45 U.S for a margarita and 2 rye and cokes!!) Rooms for the most part were quiet...but be advised that if you have a room with an adjoining door to another room, you can hear WORD FOR WORD what the people in the other room are saying (not so fun if they are super early birds like we had next to us). Front doors of all hotel rooms are needing to be replaced, as they are ALL damaged in one way or another. Bartenders in Mermaids Lounge could have used a class in friendliness. Location is very poor if you want to be where the nightlife and strip are.....but a great location if you want to be away from the strip and want it quieter yet still fun. Don't expect a great shuttle service.....they offer 3 shuttles a day to the Ceasar's Palace (11am, 5pm and 10pm). You have to figure out how to get back to the Silverton yourself. We never used the shuttle because we thought the times were inconvenient. Cab to the strip costs between $22 to $25 one way. There is NO shuttle to and from the airport....cab from the airport is about $20. ATM machine in hotel charges a $22 fee per transaction....yes you read that right...so make sure you get cash somewhere else. NOTE: This is important!! If staying here, go and get your Discovery Club card from within the casino....usually I don't bother with these things because they are just a gimmick, but there was zero hitch with this....it gives you amazing drink and food discounts and buffet was half price with the card. ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: Only 3 minutes away is the new \"SouthPoint\" hotel and casino....its gorgeous, its massive, and the Silverado Steakhouse there served us the nicest meal we have EVER had in a restaurant.....12 oz. lobster tails broiled to perfection, amazing prime rib, roasted asparagus with decadent white wine hollandaise sauce, delicious salads prepared table side, and an excellent/professional/friendly waiter and staff. SO, pros and cons to this hotel......but to be honest we will stay at the Paris or another we are familiar with on the strip again. The Paris is lovely to stay at, and so is the Monte Carlo. The Aladdin was amazing to stay at as well, but it is now called the Planet Hollywood and looked loud to us.

We were able to check in at 900am with no problem. At check in we were given some very good coupons from booking through expedia. You will need a rental car at this location. The decor was rustic and had a disney wilderness lodge theme which was very cool. The pool was one that you would find at a community center. It is very plain, but peaceful. The room was very nice, the beds were the most comfortable bed that we have ever slept on in vegas, The ac worked great. The bathroom is the problem, it is very very small.

I haven been very impressed overall. Rooms: the rooms are nice and comfortable. They are not fancy, but they are clean. The t.v. is a 27\", and also is nothing fancy but it gets the job done. The rooms are clean, and the beds are pretty comfortable. Not as comfortable as at home, but they get the job done. Although I couldn't get the wireless internet to work, they had a network cable plug in, and the network connection was very fast. Casino: The casino like the rooms, is nothing fabulous, but it gets the job done. It is nicely laid out and has a lot of different options. Table games are plentiful, though it is very possible you will be the only person playing. I was playing double deck $5 blackjack and it was just me! The poker room is pretty bad. I was only actually able to play 1 time as there was never enough people to play. There is a lot of choices and the casino was not overly smoky in my opinion unlike some other posters said. Hotel Services: The valet was a tad lacking. They were never very busy, but it took quite a bit of time (15 minutes) on average to get the car. It also took some time to drop off your car because sometimes there were no valet employees around. Still much quicker to get your car than at a mega resort because there aren't 100 people in front of you, and the workers worked hard, just seemed to be a little understaffed. Room service was average, nothing great, but the price was good. It was very iffy at night whether or not you would be able to get food. One night when I called at 1:00 a.m., nobody answered so I called the front desk. They said \"Oh they must not be at their post call them back in 5 minutes\". So 5 minutes, then 10 minutes, then 15 minutes later i called, and was never able to gety anything. Business services were non existent, and if you want a boarding pass printed you have to have the front desk do it since they don't have a business center. Dining: We only ate at the buffet and room service. Buffet was very good, especially the sunday brunch. We were very impressed, and for $16.99 you got a very good buffet with unlimited champagne drinks like mimosa's. The dinner buffer was $19.99 and with it you got unlimited house wine. As I said earlier room service was good, if unspectacular. Good value for the money. Location: I really liked the location. It's very convenient to I-15. If you are not going to rent a car though, DO NOT STAY HERE. I always get a rental in Vegas, and have no idea why you wouldn't get one. If you don't I would not stay here. Would probably be at least a $15 cab ride to the MGM one way, if you could get one. I never saw one out front. They have a shuttle, but it only goes every 5 hours??? I don't know why they bother, every 5 hours? They're only 10 or 15 minutes from the MGM, so why they couldn't go every 1 or 2 hours, I don't know. I think it boils down to the running theme of the hotel, which is that they are a tad understaffed. Overall: I really like this hotel. I know I mentioned a lot of negative things about this hotel, but I would definitely stay here again. I paid $40 a night including tax, and for that price I wouldn't stay anywhere else. It has a few problems, but the rooms are clean, the employees friendly and the food is good. I also really like the location, but make sure you get a rental car. I stayed at the Venetian and Signature MGM Grand my las two times to Vegas. This place obviously isn't as nice. But for the money, it definitely is great.

(see my review on that place) anyway, we decided to take a chance with silverton, and i am really glad we did! silverton is easy to get to (is is about 3 miles south of the start of the main strip) and for once, we did not have to walk from one end of the place to the other to get to where our room was---usually the casinos seem to have it so you have to walk through the length of the casino (and drop some cash) on your way to your room. the room was exceptionally clean! and, though i have not had a response from them yet, i emailed the silverton to ask what brand bed they have----i had the most comfortable nights sleep that i have had in ages! ( i would really like to purchase the brand that they stock at their hotel for our house) we didn't have time to hang around as we were busy going to our show and such, but we did see the aquarium which is really nice and i think they also have a \"mermaid\" show daily. the only drawback of the silverton would be shower flow---it needed more pressure. that room cost us $78.00 and change---$1.00 under what the motel 6 was charging---i would stay here anytime. both people we dealt with at check-in were very pleasant and treated us with friendliness and respect. next time we come to vegas i would definately stay at silverton--they have proved themselves to be a very nice place.", "Date": "April 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, or", "Title": "\u201cWould not recommend\u201d", "Author": "donz2", "ReviewID": "UR15222107", "Content": "We had a first floor, non-smoking room but due to the quantity of smoke from the casino, everything in the room smelled smoky and you were hit with the smoke as soon as leaving the room.

We received two offers from the Silverton Hotel and Casino for a $29.99 room and a $39.99 room for one night. We reserved the rooms over the phone about a month ahead of time for the Laboe Day trip. We were in Vegas for eight days, but only one night at the Silverton. My sister, her husband and kids were traveling with my husband and I, and his parents, so we gave them one room while we stayed across the hall in the other room on Wed., Aug. 29th. We have stayed at this property several times in the past and have always enjoyed our stays. We had two beds in our room and they were fairly firm, while my sister had two much softer beds. The room was non-smoking and it didn't smell like smoke until you walked out into the hallway. This is probably due to our room being on the ground level a few halls away from the casino. You probably won't have that problem if you're on a higher floor if smoke is an issue. The rooms are very spacious, as well as the bathrooms. They were refurbished a couple of years ago, so the fixtures and decorations are updated. While we were there, we showed everyone the aquarium which is pretty neat and spent a little time in the casino using the coupons from the American Casino Guide. The Bass Pro Shop, which is connected, was closed since we arrived late, so we didn't go there on this trip. We have been there several times and it is a fairly large store with everything you would find in the Bass Pro's at home (we are from Missouri). They do have souvenier Bass Pro t-shirts and you can find a 20% off of any one item discount coupon in the free What's On Magazine around town. There may be one in your room upon arrival, so make sure you check it before heading to the store. There are lots of other coupons in that magazine as well. My sister and her family left early for the Grand Canyon, while we stayed in Vegas since we had been to the GC a few times. They grabbed breakfast at a IHOP, which is fairly close. We ate lunch at the Silverton buffet, which is much better (and more expensive) than the buffet of the past. We had a buy-one, get-one free coupon from the American Casino Guide, so the price was reasonable. Check-in and out of the hotel was very easy. We gave the front desk a $100 cash deposit instead of having them put a hold on our credit card for incidentals since we were on an extended trip.

Its thousands and thousands of gallons, with tropical fish, some sharks... its very, very nice and of course, the best part is that its FREE. They also have a store called the Great Oudoors, I believe and it is IMPRESSIVE. They have all kinds of taxidermied (is that a word) Animials, Moose, Lion, Giraffee, ducks, fish... you get the idea. Its just amazing. You can get ANYTHING there if you love the outdoors, hunting, fishing, camping, boating, swimming... all the good stuff.

The food is wonderful and as buffet's go, first class, totally. The staff is excellent. My Son wanted a hamburger and that was not something they had in eye-sight, so I inquired as to if that was something that we could get and the Chef went to one of the resturaunts and got one and made it especially for him!

I am a fan. I have read through some of the negative comments posted by others and can only offer that as a frequent LV visitor, I have had good and bad experiences at most all places I have stayed. It's the nature of this extremely high guest-traffic city. Silverton rooms are spacious, well appointed, and feature several small touches I really appreciate, such as a CD player, dimmers on all lamps, a curved shower rod, and a nice cushion top mattress. The only negative I can offer is that the A/C is a built-in wall unit, rather than a central-type. Although it has an adjustable temperature control, it is not digital and there are only 2 settings on the fan. The fan is sort of loud and annoying. That being said, I usually sleep well through it. There is a mini-bar in the room. The aquarium is the best I have ever seen in my life. It's awesome. The nearby mermaid lounge has a tank of jellyfish behind the bar. There is a Bass Pro Shops for outdoorsmen (and ladies). The Sundance Cafe is a very good coffee shop. Again, service is spotty all over vegas. Usually its good here. I actually like sitting at the large granite counter when I am alone. Note to breakfast fans: Opt for the traditional hash browns over the other potatoe choice. I like \"Joe's Shuffle\" which is scrambled eggs with spinach, onions and turkey sausage (plus potatoes and toast) for $5.25. I have not tried the Buffet or Steak House. The Shady Grove has excellent Happy Hour specials (4-7 M-F), like $2 Grey Goose shots, while the new Mexican restaurant has $1 Patron shots and $2 appetizers. The staff have always been friendly to me. Good Bloody Mary's while I was playing on Sunday. The pool is large (unheated) and usually quiet with few kids screaming and splashing. I have used the hot tub at all hours. They do have concerts at the pool area in summer. You can relax in the water and see the band. Please note that it's a drive to the strip (approx. 5 miles) but if you want to stay off-strip or just want a really good value, this is it. Join the club and use your card.

I chose this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews. We were looking for just one night's good sleep outside of Vegas for our family, and boy, was the sleep great.! The beds were very comfortable and the room was oversized. The hotel was easy to find from the airport using mapquest directions although at the time (September 2006) there is construction going on in the area, so watch the signs and the traffic. It's a little tricky. The parking lot was a little confusing going just one-way in spots and finding the front desk was a challenge. I know it's a casino and you have to travel that maze to get to anything, but it's still a pain--especially with two little kids in tow. We did not come to gamble and cannot comment on anything like that except to say that I hated dragging them through the smokey casino. But I knew this when I booked the room. I would not stay here on a long term basis for this reason alone, but for one night after a 7 hour flight, the spacious rooms and comfy beds were worth the quick entrance and exit. The hotel is attached to a Bass Pro Shop and the area between the store and the casino has a huge fish tank that periodically features a live \"mermaid\" which was the highlight of our 4 year old little girl's stay. She got to see \"Ariel\" who was tastefully clothed in a mermaid suit that had a flesh colored suit underneath--so you weren't really seeing what you thought you were seeing. A plus for us prudes. She swam with stingrays, small sharks and other fish and even came to the glass to interact with our daughter. Our room was ready when we arrived around 1pm local time. It was oversized with two queen beds with heavenly pillow-top matresses and very comfortable pillows. We were on the 4th floor which was supposed to be non-smoking, but there was always a faint odor of smoke, possibly rising up from the casino or other floors. Our room did not smell as if it had been smoked in. The room was clean, spacious and cool in the 90 degree heat. The air conditioner worked great, but was a bit loud. We did not mind and did not need to use our white-noise machine. But if you like quiet, it was loud. The drapes darkened the room well when we went to bed early because we had come from a different time zone. Our room overlooked the pool which was lit up beautifully in the dark, but we did not swim. Did I say that the beds were fabulous? Better than any $40 hotel I've ever stayed at. Come to think of it, I don't think I ever did stay at a $40 hotel before! But book through Vegas.com to get a better price than you can get through their regular website. Rooms at this price are limited so book early if you can. The bathroom was average and included a hairdryer, but the bonus was the Bath & Body Works toiletries. It was a nice touch. No cheap hotel soap here. I would definitely stay here again if I was coming through town, there is a lot of room for the children to move around in, a table to have dinner at (only two chairs) and a Bass Pro Shops next door. I believe they have an RV Park too and several restaurants which we did not visit. Just a short drive away is the very bottom of Las Vegas Blvd. and several places to eat and a grocery store. We also purchased a double CD containing about 16-18 songs that was in the room for $12.99 which seemed reasonable. It was a nice variety of music from Aretha Franklin to Sonny & Cher, Captain & Tenille to Bonnie Tyler. It did not seem overpriced as many hotel items are. Speaking of which, there were $6 bottles of Evian and a mini bar available, but we didn't even open them up. I would not stay here long term simply because of the faint smell of smoke (we are asthmatics) and because the children had to walk through the casino to get anywhere, but it is a VERY comfortable place to stay after a long flight, passing through or for adults only.", "Date": "October 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cNice Stay\u201d", "Author": "jwjones", "ReviewID": "UR5925826", "Content": "Stayed in rm4032 on 9/13/06.Quiet,comfortable and clean room.Shuttle to strip.Located in safe area for a good price and value.", "Date": "October 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "california", "Title": "\u201coff the strip cheap rates without comprising quality\u201d", "Author": "lasvegaschick", "ReviewID": "UR5700897", "Content": "My husband and I are a fairly young crowd for this hotel (28 and 31). Majority of the crowd seemed a little older and more mature looking to gamble without all the action and chaos of the strip. What drew us to the casino were the cheap rates. My husband and I come to Vegas often and were a little tired of paying the high costs of rooms on weekends so we decided to try a hotel off the strip. For those who are looking for cheap rates at a nice joint (because honestly, the only time you spend in your room is to sleep and shower so you can hit the casino again) and taking a short drive to the main strip isn't too much of an iconvenience, I would reccommend this hotel. The rooms are comparable to any main strip hotel, all the amenities etc. etc. etc. Have some more money in your pocket to gamble with, rather than paying for a big name casino!", "Date": "August 23, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Silverton Hotel and Casino", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d97691-Reviews-Silverton_Hotel_and_Casino-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html", "Price": "$41 - $91*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3333 Blue Diamond Rd.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Las Vegas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NV</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">89139</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515635", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/f7/5e/fa/silverton-casino-hotel.jpg"}}
