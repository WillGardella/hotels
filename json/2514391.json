I have traveled all over the world and this is one of worst hotels we have ever stayed in. We were booked into a room that had about 1 meter walking space around the bed, no closet, poor mechanical system, poor bedding, a steam pipe running through the middle of the bathroom, decorated in ugly 1970's decor, and a dropped ceiling with lay-in fluorescent lighting. It was dark, dingy and smelly. We complained and were eventually moved to a better room. The better room was comparable to a Red Roof Inn or Motel 6. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT book this hotel.

The fee is $50 (includes toll) - The hotel booked a 'taxi' for our return to JFK which turned out to be a private car which turned up half an hour early. We were also charged $68 in stead of $50. We were not warned by the reception staff. We had no change as we expected a taxi where you can swipe a credit, debit or travel card. This resulted in a stressful dash to find an ATM that would accept one of our cards whilst rushing to get to our flight. Overall, a good, clean hotel that is affordable and in a great location.

What appeared to be an excellent choice with reference to tripadvisor and other sources, turned out to be a holiday wrecker. Essentially, don't trust every review on this website. Upon checking in, the hotel staff did not properly greet us nor did they offer us any assistance with the neighborhood. When actually getting to the room (located on upper floors) we were presented with a 60's decor room which was not renovated to appear 'modern' as advertised. The worst part about our stay was that the shower was approx 80x80cm in company with a hot water system that took 5mins+ for the first person to get a steady stream of hot water. Most of the time the temperature of the water was random, and was intermittent changing from extremely hot, to freezing cold. In addition to this, the complimentary WiFi was almost close to useless as it was only available in the lobby which never worked. The server had continuously rejected the guests attempt to connect. When querying the staff about why it did not work, they would just provide a generic excuse and blow it off. It was evident from many of the guests attempting to use the WiFi that they were also at the point of snapping. When it did work, it was acceptable.

As a return visitor to New York we knew that we would spend very little time in the hotel itself and so the main focus was proximity to Penn St Station. The reason being that if you fly into Newark Liberty Airport then you can catch the air train and then the NJ Transat train to Penn St Station for a fraction of the cost that a taxi or transfer would cost. It is so simple to do and by the time you consider traffic, takes the same amount of time. The second factor was location and for what we wanted, the hotel was ideal. It is located 2 blocks from 5th avenue and all the shopping, a stones throw from the empire state and easy walking distance to the theatre district of broadway, times square and even central park. If walking aint your thing then when exiting the hotel you turn right and 1 block over there is a subway station that on the green line will take you all the way uptown or indeed all the way downtown as far a brooklyn bridge. The hotel itself was basic and slightly dated. Staff at reception were all foreign but very pleasant. There is only one lift and its slow. The room was a little on the grey and depressing side but spotlessly clean, with decent floor space for a NY hotel room and a more than adequate bathroom (good shower) We are a couple in our early 30s and are pretty easy going on accomodation standards so long as its clean and safe. This hotel certainly was. Unless budget is not a concern then my thinking is why waste money at an expensive hotel in a city where it would be a crime to not be out all day every day experiencing all it has to offer.

There are pharmacies nearby to buy basic needs like water, toiletries and stuff. A lot of restaurants nearby, we especially liked the Bonchon chicken that was just around the corner. We lucked out on the Korean restaurants though, the one we tried near the hotel wasn't really that great. The only problem we had with the hotel is that they only had 1 elevator, so sometimes it could get full. Also we had problems with the housekeeping, it happened not only once but twice that they would just go inside the room without even knocking! After that we always hanged a do not disturb sign at the door and we would place a chair to block the door just in case. Talk about rude!

The only good comment I have is that it was a clean room! To get into the hotel, the doors are not automatic and you must lug your suitcase up a few stairs. Someone from across the street, helped me, because I was struggling. You get in and the lobby is dingy at best. The one elevator is small and slow. The stairs are so steep and narrow, you don't want to go up and down and you would be unsafe during an emergency; in my opinion. When you get off the elevator, you barely have enough room for your luggage to go fit going down the hall, the halls are so narrow. You must go through sets of fire doors for rooms. They have the rooms in about 3 per fire door. I had to go through 2 fire doors. The walls are paper thin and I heard my neighbors every word; and they were not loud. The beds were outdated with the bed frames and bedding. It looked like they came from the late 1960's to early 1970's. There were bedspreads; not comforters and hiddious! The blanket was lime green and really ugly. There was no writing pad next to the bed with a pen. Every hotel has that. There was no kleenex in the bathroom. The towels were nice quality; I will give them that. The lighting in the room was from the ceiling as if it were a former office building now converted to a hotel. It was awful. What lamps they had were not great. There was a small travel ironing board that you had to pull out from the wall, like a hide-a-bed. That was laughable! There was no gym at the hotel and no room service. You had to go and get it yourself; downstairs in a dingy cafe joining the hotel.

Here is my review : Room rate : we had reserved our room about 1,5 months prior our stay and I can say that the room rate was quite reasonable compared to other similar hotels in the area... Location : on 32nd street between Madison and Park Avenues... Location is great , especially at this price range. Only 1,5 blocks from Empire State - 2 blocks from Macy's and about 15-17 minutes walking to Times Square (of course without any stops on the way) and many other attractions (including 5 mins walk to double-decker sightseeing bus stop)...there are 3 Subway stops very close to the hotel at about 2 mins walking distance ... Hotel Staff & Room Service : they were very helpful and friendly all the time... we were able to leave our luggages (2 mid, 2 large-sized pieces ! ) for almost whole day last day (our flight was at midnight) in a separate/locked/dedicated 'luggage room'... they arranged a shuttle (actually a limo for only two of us) to JFK (almost at the same price as a regular yellow-cab ;) ... We only needed Room Service once when we asked for additional towels and we were delivered quickly... Room : ours had one small window without any view... it was at the back of the hotel... could be a little depressing for some but the plus side was having NO street noise at all... Bed size&comfort was also great .. So we had very comfortable sleep... Room size was just enough for two of us... we arrived with two mid-size luggages and after having made some shopping after 3 days, there was just about 1,5 m2 left in the room to move... size&view of the room did not bother us because we were leaving the room around 9 a.m and returning back at around 11 pm everyday... but if you are planning to spend time in the room, then room size might bother you ... (see the photos) Cleanliness: NO bedbugs, NO strange odour (like some reviews mentioned) whatsoever ... Our room was cleaned every day... the sheets were changed two-three times during our 6-nights-stay, which I think is reasonable... And bathroom/toilet was cleaned everyday ... Restaurant: we had breakfast once at Captain Cafe which is next-door and like a part of the hotel... breakfast was good but we wanted to try out different places everyday as there are many other deli's - cafe's in the neighborhood... you should eat at Captain Cafe at least once... Suggestion: if you are at or close to the hotel at lunch time, there is Silo Cafe right across the street... it is packed with people (a good sign for having fresh food) and has various alternatives to eat ... not recommended for breakfast though as food is not as fresh as what is served in Captain Cafe (which is also cheaper)... If you like sushi, you should try 'Umi Sushi' on 31st street on Park Ave ... great sushi at reasonable prices... only 3-4 mins walking from the hotel. 'lobster cha-cha roll' is a must-eat there :) Final word : this is a basic but clean hotel with a great location. What we liked best was the location & hotel staff -- what we liked least was having NO free internet (wi-fi) in the room... but anyway, definitely recommended !", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ascot, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBuyer beware\u201d", "Author": "NicWoosh", "ReviewID": "UR106823306", "Content": "How disappointing! I use Trip Advisor for all my travel decisions now and this is the first time the reviews let me down.

What it is is very clean and in a great location, round the corner from Empire Tower and roughly in the middle of Manhattan. It was also quiet - although I sleep with ear plugs to be safe - except for the odd noisey neighbour (residential I think) it lived up to that possibly because there were no windows to mention - just a tiny slither in both bed & bathroom. On arrival externally looks OK on entry looks like a youth hostel to me - check out their website as it is representative and clearly states budget hotel. There is a cafe annexed which we didn't visit - not for me. However there is an amazing cafe/diner around the corner on Madison right next to the Deli (left out the front & right at first corner in the middle on opposite side). The Diner is not stylish or anything and looks like a typical diner, however staff were great, food is excellent (best breakfasts in the US and we travelled) so use it if staying here. So there were 3 of us in one room and unfortunately you could not swing a cat in the remaining space or bathroom for that matter.

The location is perfect (just a block and a half from Empire State and a 30 second walk to the 33rd St Subway station. A 10-15 minute walk to Times Square). The room we got was actually directly opposite the room we had last year....the difference being that this time it faced onto the street which gave me concerns about possible noise in the early hours that I had heard about........turned out to be not a problem! The rooms are small, but as I have said before....you don't go to NYC to stay in your room! The bed was large and comfortable, the TV had plenty of channels for when you were in the room, the hanging space for clothes, whilst not immense, was fine....with enough draw space. The bathroom was clean with toilet, wash basin, and shower over the bathtub. The shower was again powerful and easily adjusted to whatever temp you required. The Air-Con was a real boon given the temps on the first 3 days were 93, 98 and 96 degrees! On the one occasion when a problem did occur with the water (it turned out that there was a pressure problem which effected the whole hotel) the staff leaped into action and were immediately on the phone to get it fixed (on a Sunday!). By the time we returned, all was fine again. I cannot give high enough praise to the staff. From the front desk to the cleaning staff, they were top notch and friendly (in particular the cleaners, who without fail would greet you with a cheery \"good morning\" if you passed them in the corridors). The free safety deposit boxes behind the front desk was great for peace of mind and they were very secure. They could only be opened with the key given to yourself and one from the front desk staff on duty. One SMALL downside is the elevator, which is slow. I would always walk DOWN the 3 flights of stairs rather than take the chance of standing around on the off chance that the elevator would be in the vicinity of my floor....but if waiting a for a minute or two for the elevator to take you UP to your room is going spoil your holiday, then perhaps the Hilton or The Waldorf would be better for you. The adjoining Captain Cafe serve great breakfasts (although I did tend to go to Miss K's deli around the corner on Madison for a more 'local' feel whilst having my Egg on a Roll, large cup of coffee and read of the New York Post.....it just felt more Noo Yawk!) The internet at the hotel is a little pricey, but it works fine if you need to use it. I also do believe that they have free wi-fi connection on offer, but seeing as I didn't take any wi-fi enabled devices with me, then I can't comment on how well this worked. The subway along the street runs both uptown and downtown, although it should be noted that it is a 'local stop' and only the 6 train stops there. No problem....they were frequent and transferring to other lines is easy. The subway system is superb (be aware that whilst standing on the platforms waiting for a train, it is very hot....but the carriages are A/C'd). I travelled on the system to various parts of the city from early morning to very late at night and never once felt threatened. Just absorb the New York vibe and run with it....it's GREAT! The people, whilst in a hurry, were always courteous and friendly.....with basic manners such as \"please\", \"thank you\", \"excuse me\" and \"sorry\" (if they bumped into you....with an additional \"sir\" if they were remotely younger than you!) came readily from their lips.

The airco makes some noise but after one night I got used to it. We got a room at the back of the hotel and we had no view but also no noise from the street. You could easily switch off your airco without your room getting to hot during the night. This way you could avoid the noise completely. Our toilet got blocked once due to our own fault. The staff came to help us immediately. They were very friendly and were always helpful. We asked to each pay our part of the bill and that was nog problem at all. They were always there to give us good adresses to eat or drink something. The rooms are cleaned every day and the service is very good. Internet is expensive but we could easily connect to free unprotected wifi in the room. So you could try this if you don't want to spend money on internet. If you don't need much this hotel is perfect. The location is amazing. You are within walking distance of the empire state building, times square, penn station,... and there is a subway station on the corner. We payed $1000 for 5 nights for 4 people.

We arrived at Newark International airport Thurday afternoon and grabbed a cab outside straight away. Taxi ride was an adventure in itself lol. Arrived at the hotel no probs and it looks really nice from the outside and we were allocated room 302 which is at the front of the hotel. The room was basic but clean and that's exactly what I was looking for. Bathroom was lovely and the shower was amazing. When you stand outside the hotel and look up your met with a spectacular view of the Empire State Building. I was always under the impression that the blocks in NY were long but I was wrong because really everything you need to see is within walking distance and being next to the Empire State Building was amazing. We pretty much walked everywhere including all the way up to Central Park. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a basic, clean and centrally located hotel and if it cost an extra $400 i'd probably pay it no probs just because where it is. The only issue I had was the fact that you can hear outside traffic and a couple of nights it went on until 4am in the morning and then all of a sudden it was quiet. We ate in the captain cafe attached to the hotel and the pancakes were exactly what you get in the movies with a big dod of butter at the size of the plate (yum yum). I was also recommend that you take a bus tour (hop on/off). There's tonnes of guys at the side of the streets who will try and get you to buy a bus tour ticket and I have to admit that at first I was really apprehensive about booking but decided to give it a bash so we opted for Gray Lines Tour Operator who charge $88 dollars for a 2 day pass and included in this price is entry to the 86th Observation Floor of the Empire State Building, ferry to Ellis Island and Liberty Island. You also get to hop on and off the bus at all your favourite spots i.e Time Square, Central Park, Macy's etc... and they also run a 2 hour tour of NY at night in which you cross the Manhattan Bridge to Brooklyn which was def the best bit. The tour guides are extremely knowledgeable and very funny. This was excellent valve for money... All in all everything was perfect about this trip and if you want to save a bit of cash getting back to Newark airport go to penn station at Madison Square Gardens and there's a train every 15 mins that takes you direct to the airport at a fraction of the cost.

The rooms are a great size and the bed was very comfy. We were on the second floor, above the main entrance.

There was also a lack of hangers, this may not be an issue to some people though. The shower is great and the water was always hot. There is a cafe, Captains Cafe, attached to the hotel. This is ACE, great food and service. We had breakfast here every morning, and it set us up for the day!! There is also a fab 24 hour deli on Madison, 2 minute walk from the Hotel.

Our trip was for 4 nights and 5 days. We found this hotel on Expedia for about $100/night CAD which was a great deal compared to some of the other hotels. Before we left, I read some reviews about this hotel so a week before we left, I emailed the hotel and requested a room in a quiet section of the hotel. Check-in was really quick and easy. They were also flexible with us checking in before 4pm (their check-in time). The room was clean and small with a double bed, but that was okay as we were expecting this. The bed was really soft and comfortable, however, my boyfriend didn't think it was firm enough; nonetheless we both slept very well each night and the room was a great location as it was really quiet (no outside noise). There was also a mini-fridge which was very handy as the week we were there, it was really hot so we could buy bottles of water and store it in the fridge. The people at the hotel were really nice and accomodating. The manager even gave us a free pass at the internet since it was our first usage. The hotel also had a secured luggage storage area which was useful as on the day of check-out, our transportation wasn't going to be until later that evening so we were able to put our luggages into storage at no cost and do a one last tour of the city and then retrieve the luggages later that evening. The location of the hotel is excellent! It is literally about a block away from the Empire State Building. You could even walk to Times Square! It's only about a 30 minute walk from the hotel to Times Square one way. This hotel is also close to food areas. The only thing we didn't know about the hotel was that it is in Korea Town, which is fine, but since there are a lot of Korean/Japanese restaurants on the same street as the hotel, if you walk that street, it reeks of garbage. We arrived Saturday afternoon and all weekend, as soon as you stepped outside, it stank! However, the smell toned down a bit during the week (probably because garbage trucks were working again). I thought that was the only downfall, but since the hotel is in a great location, we bear it! The hotel also has a cafe beside it so it was really convenient to just grab a bagel/muffin or something and go on your way instead of having to search for a breakfast place.

They themselves spoke English but w/accent so maybe that's why.I say treat everyone the same. The only time we took the elevator was when we checked in & out otherwise we always took the stairs the one flight to our room.The very few times we saw the maids they were very friendly. This is a nice small hotel close to everything. I would not hesitate to stay here again on my next trip to NYC.Hopefully front desk people warm up to us non foreigners & they'll work on free internet.Voucher for 10 minute use very cheap of them. Ladies,go to Century 21 for shopping.Had to buy boots 'cause it snowed.Got great pair of Bearpaws for $38!Can't find that price back home/online! And great $5 supposedly pashmina scarves.I loaded up for souvenirs.Use Captains Cafe. Tony very nice. Breakfast for two was never more than $12 w/tip if that & can get your coffee/cocoa to go.City pass is the way to go.Good price & lines shorter than general public lines.Get metro card & don't be afraid of riding the subway.I always buy 7 day option.Great value & very safe. Never an issue & this is 2nd week long visit to NYC in 2008. I can't believe how much of a police force is always present almost everywhere. Always felt safe in NYC. Go to Astro Gallery of Gems on 34th if you want to see awesome mineral specimens. My son is a rockhound so if anyone else has an interest in this,best store in the country for specimens.

Staff were very helpful and after contacting the agents themselves they were able to resolve the problem and fit us in as planned.

Room was as described by other reviewers - clean, adequate size, reasonable ensuite facilities (rare in this price bracket in Manhattan), and very helpful staff. Ideally located near the Empire State. We recommend you go up as soon as you arrive to get your bearings, and forget the map but DO use the audio guide. If you buy a city pass, the Empire state includes the audio guide as part of the deal. Go and see the Museum of Natural history, Metropolitan art gallery, but we felt that there was a touch of \"the kings new clothes\" about the Guggenheim and the Museum of Modern Art.

The hotel is located in a relatively quiet street, providing a calm environment away from the hustle and bustle of the city. I arrived very late for my 3-night stay, at nearly midnight, and received a polite welcome at the hotel reception. The reception area is impressive for a small hotel, with a bright and clean feel. I was allocated a room with a double bed at the rear of the building. The room was of reasonable size and well-furnished in typical American style with heavy dark-wood furniture. The bathroom was spacious with a large bath, and nicely decorated in a marble effect. The bedroom and bathroom each had a window onto a shaft at the back of the building. As a consequence, there wasn't much natural light in the room, but this should not be a problem when not spending much time in the room during daylight hours. My only real criticism is that, as usual, there was a humming noise from this shaft, night and day, so I had to close the windows and use ear-plugs to get to sleep. Nevertheless, the comfortable bed allowed me a good night's sleep and, overall, the room provided a perfectly adequate base for a short visit to New York. Breakfast was not included in the room rate (which was $175 per night plus taxes), but the hotel has a small adjoining coffee shop where an excellent breakfast can be had at a reasonable price. Another positive feature of this hotel is cleanliness. The room and communal areas were very clean, and every morning the biggest band of cleaning staff that I have even seen in a hotel was clearly visible at work.

When we checked in we got one room with a double bed; we told them we had requested two single beds, but they said they did not have any rooms available but they could upgrade us to a quadruple (one room with a bathroom with a connecting room with a double bed and no bathroom) but they demanded 50% more. They said the request was just that and they were not bound to do anything. Furthermore, the administrator said he did know how to treat Expedia bookings, which means they don't give a damn what clients are offered. Since we had already paid for the stay and it was close to Xmas we did have no option and ended up paying just under what we would have paid in a better hotel. The hotel staff was just brutal to us. They lied, treated us badly and when we voiced our discontent with such a rip off they threatened to call the police if we kept complaining. Every time I told the reception clerk the things he had said he turned my words around and accused me of being a liar and demanding a free room.

Anyway, I finally find the Hotel Grand Union and give them a call. They had exactly what I needed, which was a basic room with a private bathroom (note to 1st time New Yorkers: private bathrooms are not always included, so be sure to request this when booking), and simple sleeping arangements for my sister and myself. It is only rated a 2star I think, but we were willing to spend the extra money to upgrade from a 1star. After reading all the reviews I was too worried about rats/mice/smells/etc., in the 1star hotels. We arrive and it is in a PERFECT location, 32 and park, which happens to be one block from the subway stop we took from JFK, a few blocks away from the Empire State Bldg, and Macys. The one subway stop we had great access to took us all the way up to Central Park and all the way down to groud zero. The place doesn't smell, the employees were very friendly, and we got to check in three hours early. The room was small, but that didn't matter to us. It had one twin bed and one double bed. The room didn't smell, had clean sheets, was free of rodents and insects, and had a surprisingly clean, nice, bright, but small bathroom (see pics). It was perfect for us. We were only in the room to sleep and change cloths, so it was just what we needed. They let us keep our luggage there for 6 hours after checkout so we could spend more time in NYC. Maybe people know this, but I had never used this service. It was free and we locked our bags in a room with a video camera. People do have access to the room, but only if they also have bags in it.

There is a subway on Lexington Avenue (20 yards to the right) where trains 4, 5 and 6 run. This is the green line and they run down towards the Staten Island Ferry and up by Bloomingdales. The price paid for this hotel was extremely reasonable, especially for what you get. The cost is approximately \u00a380 per night per room. This is really cheap for New York especially with an inside bathroom, which was one of the nicest I have seen. Marble and very clean. Shower worked great too and the towels were thick and big and changed daily. There is a small diner attached to the hotel which serves great breakfasts. It is run by a guy called Tony who looks quite dour but is in fact a nice guy, quite funny. This is my fourth time in New York and I would say this is the nicest hotel I have stayed in. The only down point is that it is a bit away from the \"action\". Most of the other hotels I stayed in were in the Times Square area. However, don't let that put you off. If it is a budget hotel you are looking for and one which is clean then this is a good place to start looking. A couple of points of interest. In New York definitely go on the bus tour of the city. You get to see it all and the information you get can be invaluable. It is also quite a history lesson. If you like jazz go to Dizzy's Coca Cola club located in the Lincoln Centre but reserve your table here before you go.(You can do that on the interrnet direct).

A chair and table, a chest of drawers and an armoire that housed a 28\u201d television. All of this was in Dark wood. The d\u00e9cor was old fashioned.

Accommodation was in threes; two singles and a double (a family room). Having read reviews warning us of bed bugs and stains I went somewhat apprehensively, I need not have done so. Each room boasts air conditioning which seemed to be little more than a noisy fan in the window! A fridge is provided but no safe, I dared not venture into the former however a most appreciated feature was the ability to remove coat hangers \u2013many hotels are now resorting to having fiddly secured coat hangers. The bathroom was pretty much standard with an un-secured hair dryer, once again another useful addition which tends to be being either phased out or placed on short secured leads. I am still unsure as to the internet situation however I believe it to be this: free wireless broadband throughout the hotel with paid broadband downstairs in their lobby. As for travel around the city, 33rd Street Subway and 34th Street Herald Square are one and four blocks away respectively, the latter being most useful. There are eight floors (US style!) with extremely narrow and rather steep staircases in between, so if you\u2019re carrying luggage even to the second floor (US style!) then use the lift.

Otherwise, it was extremely quiet with no sound from other rooms coming through.

Essentially this was a clean and ideally located hotel (central Manhattan for under $200 per night is pretty good).

So, we asked to move and got given room 805, which was much better and had great views of the Empire State Building. I agree with most of the other reviews - the rooms look a bit tired, the shower temperature was a bit erratic but everything worked. The major bonus of the hotel is its position. There is a subway 20 yards from the front door and another three blocks away that can take you wherever you need. You can walk to the Empire State, Times Square, Macys etc in minutes.

Upon arrival, the front desk staff immediately found our reservation; however, they insisted that the room type booked (two double beds) was not available. The only option was to go for a room with three beds (two twin and one double), at a higher rate. When I asked if I could look at the room first, I was told that I would have to pre-pay one night first. After hearing this, I figured this place was a total scam. (Any respectable hotel will at least let you look at the room.) My first impressions of the room were that of tiredness. The carpet and furniture were stained, the beds worn out and the sheets threadbare. To the hotel's credit, the room was quiet, the bathroom was clean and there were no bed bugs. The shower did have some temperature problems; however, it was not unusable. The toilet's water pressure was unacceptable, though. The single elevator worked fine and there were never any elevator/hallway congestion problems. The cafe adjacent to the lobby served excellent, inexpensive breakfasts and was always busy. There is a great little pizzeria within walking distance (maybe two blocks), down Madison Ave. called Bella Napoli. On the last night I asked the front desk if they could reserve a shuttle van to LaGuardia Airport for the next morning. I was told that I needed to pay a five-dollar deposit for them to reserve a shuttle. This place will try to make an extra dollar any way they can. I ended up calling and reserving one myself. True, the staff are very brusque, but I found the best way to get what I wanted was to be just as abrupt back. If you are expecting a Holiday Inn-level of service, cleanliness, repair, quality, etc. it's not here. It's habitable; however I wouldn't stay here again or recommend it. I would rate it 1.5 stars \u2013 but was generous in giving it two stars. Here's a recap: Pros: - Cafe next door served great, inexpensive breakfasts - Location; you're close to everything - within walking distance of most landmarks/attractions - Quiet - Clean bathroom. Cons: - Old, worn out rooms, beds in need of replacing and sheets that should have been discarded several years ago. - Hotel will try to make extra money any way possible, including charging to book a shuttle to the airport, claiming the room type reserved is not available and only a more expensive one is - Toilet water pressure is abysmal - Brusque, inattentive, unpleasant staff (best dealt with by being equally abrupt)", "Date": "October 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "wtracing", "Title": "\u201cIts a Mixed Bag!\u201d", "Author": "wtracing", "ReviewID": "UR10083853", "Content": "We stayed at Grand Union Hotel 2 nights Oct 11 & 12 for 165.00 a night booked on Travelocity.

It is right off Park Avenue South so you can walk to Grand Central Station pretty quickly as well. The Bakery next to the hotel was nice for getting a quick snack, very reasonable price. The price of this hotel for being 2 minutes from midtown (by subway) Manhattan is excellent. Housekeeping did a good job of cleaning the room, it was a tired room but seemed to be cleaned well. NEUTRAL FEELINGS: The room definitely reminds me of an old office. The bed was well used and the shower was very difficult to use. The knobs were loose and it was hard to get a constant water temperature. For the price, I thought the room was fine, but there is certainly some quirks to it that one must expect. The employees of the hotel certainly could use a little customer service training. There were several nice ones, but many times (especially late at night) was met with a blank stare from the moment we came in the door until the elevator arrived. Not a huge deal, but a simple hello would be nice. I don't really have any cons for this hotel, although depending on what one is looking for the \"neutral\" feelings could be negative ones.

I booked this via Venere.com,online because at the time they offered better rates than other hotel booking services. The hotel is situated on 32nd St.East between Madison and Park. This affords easy access to and from JFK.The room facilities were more than adequate ( TV, fridge, 4 piece bathroom and sufficient space for 5 days clothing.) The cafe next door serves a hearty breakfast for \u00a33 ( at $2 to \u00a31) with unlimited coffee. Plenty of fast food and Korean Restaurants are within minutes of the hotel. Once my wife and I , we are in our early 60's , fathomed the timing of the traffic lights we could walk to the Empire State Building in 6 minutes, Macey's in 15 and Times Square in 45 ( this was done late evening so there were no shopping attractions!!). The walk back via Bryce Gardens well worth it on Monday evening when open air films are shown - get a chair from the Library next door,most people had take away food, do the same and enjoy the party atmosphere. We would recommend taking a minimum of 2 day tour with one of the hop on hop off tour buses, we used the red one.To get maximum benefit study the map prior to boarding to ensure that you get off at points that interest you e.g. for cheap shopping downtown get off at Canal Street ( part of Chinatown). Check with the Guide at what time they expect the last one, 5pm is the last bus to leave Times Square downtown after that the night bus runs to and from Times Square with only one stop down and up at Empire State Building .There are plenty of ticket vendors milling around here from early morning. We combined our ticket with a 3 hours boat trip round Manhatten with the Circle Line. Tip - when you board walk across the boat to the opposite side , this is nearest land and gives more sightseeing. If you shop at Macey's take your passport to Customer Services, on the balcony above ground floor, for your 11% Tourist Discount Card valid until March 2008. They have a decent and reasonable priced restaurant in the basement. We did not feel at all threatened due to high visibility of Community Service Officers in all tourist areas and NY Police - check out their 3 wheeler electric patrol cars.

We booked through the hotel's Web site, received a reply the next day, sent our credit card info, and had our room confirmed promptly. It was exactly what we wanted in a New York boutique hotel: tidy, convenient, and comfortable. When we travel, we only use hotels as a place to sleep and wash up. If you want a hotel where liveried staff are tumbling over themselves to assist you, where your room is big enough to hold a formal ball, and where there are more amenities than you can stuff in your suitcase, obviously you don't want a boutique hotel. To address some of the criticisms raised elsewhere in this hotel's listing: - Room size: New York hotel rooms are small, even in some of the snazziest \"name\" properties. We had space enough for two people to easily move around without one having to wedge into a corner to allow the other to pass. We were happy. - Front desk attitude: The hotel is managed and apparently run by new American citizens whose culture is not the same as American culture (which varies from region to region anyway). We weren't expecting to add the desk staff to our Christmas card list, after all. We didn't expect gushing obsequiousness, just politeness and efficiency. We got it and were happy. - Missing towels: We were two people. We got two bath towels. When we noticed we only had one washcloth, we mentioned it to the desk staff on our way out. When we returned we found they had delivered two more. We were happy. - Room temperature: The room was hot when we checked in. We immediately located the radiator knob and turned off the heat. (OK, so we had to lift up the radiator cover to do so. Big whoop.) The room cooled down while we were out exploring. We were happy. - Ambient noise. The hotel is in New York. New York is noisy. Most New York hotels are noisy, even the fancy-schmancy ones. We brought earplugs (which every traveler should have in their toilet kits anyway). We were happy. - Room cleanliness. The room was clean, the bathroom was clean, the lobby was clean and the staff were clean. The carpet was not frayed, the furniture was well-maintained and was dusted. We were happy. We have stayed in hotels, B&Bs, and inns all over Europe and the U.S. The Hotel Grand Union compares favorably to those boutique properties we enjoyed elsewhere. The price (for New York) was great, the room clean and large enough, the amenities sufficient, the #6 subway stop just steps away, Macy's ten minutes away, Times Square a 20-minute stroll down Broadway, and the staff as polite as necessary. Unless you plan to spend most of your New York holiday in the hotel, this is the perfect place for a good night's sleep and a bath.

Finally, a quick mention to The Captain's Cafe adjoining the hotel.. It was FANTASTIC!

Very, very clean and the bathroom was clean and updated. The carpet was new. The only downside to the room was the view. Outside the window, the only thing you was a brick wall of the building next to it, but that didnt matter because we did not go to NY to look out of the window. The housekeeping staff was professional and polite and cleaned the rooms very good. The front desk staff was very helpful and friendly.

The young ladies who look after the reservations were very pleasant and gracious. We had no problems at check-in even though we were late arriving. Reception staff were pleasant, some a little more so than others. Near Reception, there is a long, narrow lobby which is bright, clean and has some computers, which are somewhat expensive to use but are there if you need them. There is a little cafe next door which we didn't get to use but many people did so it must be fine. The cafe's posted menu had very reasonable prices and the amount of food on people's plates in the morning should have set them up for the rest of the day (smile). I felt the location of the hotel was excellent - just a block and a half from 5th Avenue, between Madison and Park on East 32nd Street, and about 20 minutes or less from Times Square, if that's were you want to go. We bought the 7 day subway passes and easily travelled to Harlem, Upper West Side, Williamsburg, Coney Island and Brighton Beach so never hesitate to use the subway to get around. Using a combination of subway and bus, we even made it to Historic Richmond Town on Staten Island. We had read many of the reviews on Tripadvisor so brought along an iron, coffee maker and hairdryer as the hotel does not provide these. We were particularly glad we had brought the coffeemaker so that we did not have to leave our room before having a cup of coffee in the morning. I couldn't have lived without my hairdryer either. I am attaching pictures to this review as they can best show what the room looks like and you can make up your mind whether this room would suit you. The room and bathroom were large enough for our needs, and included a double bed, cabinet t.v. with a good selection of stations and a desk and chair. A helpful addition to the room would be to have a lamp on the desk, if anyone from the hotel is reading this. There were also bedside tables with lamps so that you could read at night and plan the next day, which is another necessity to me. The room was very clean including the linen and bedding. I prefer to have my sheets tucked in but I've noticed in a few hotels that housekeeping seems to be leaving them untucked, possibly for the sake of efficiency. There were a few stains on the floor but otherwise the carpet was not filthy and I was satisfied with the cleanliness of the room in general. The closet consisted of a clothes rack and was adequate. We had a little fridge in the room which was very handy and appreciated. And the shower was great! We were able to open the windows in our room to let in the fresh air, which we were happy about. Even though this hotel allows smoking (we do not smoke), the room did not smell of smoke at all so non-smokers, don't worry. Our bed had the hardest mattress that we have ever slept on and that, combined with the noise from the street (we were in Room 804) caused us to become somewhat sleep deprived towards the end of our holiday. However, that did not cause us to slow down because the sheer energy of New York is so fantastic that you just keep going and going, there is so much to see and do.

The toilet\u2019s flushing capacity seemed pretty weak, but it was never a serious issue for us. The cleanliness of the room and bathroom was pretty good. The towels are pretty small and basic, but they worked and were replaced every day. Nothing was dusty and I didn\u2019t see a single bug. At night the hotel was as quiet as a mouse. The only thing making any noise was our fridge, which we unplugged, but even that wasn\u2019t too noisy.

She booked the rooms for us as the Hotel Grand Union. The hotel is just around the corner from her townhome so it was a great location. It is a quaint hotel and the staff could not have been nicer. First let me state that it is not luxurious, but comfortable. A great base point if your not going to be in your room all the time. It was just my hubby and myself, we had a room with a full bed, nice bathroom an apt size frig, tv and we opted not to get the phone in our room. There were a few problems, but I am not to much of a complainer, but some people might not be able to deal with them. First, the water in the shower did not stay hot. I had to keep jumping out of the stream of water at times as it went from hot to cold. Second, there was no thermostat to regulate the heat so the room was like an oven. it had the old steam pipe heating. Thank goodness it was 30 degrees outside, so we opened the small window in the bedroom area and the window in the bathroom. We even went as far as turning on the airconditioner that was in the room. That seemed to help quite a bit. There is only one small elevator so it would suffice to say you need to be patient. There are plenty of great restaruants around the area. A little coffe shop is locted through a door in the lobby of the hotel. It is very small and serves up a great breakfast sandwich. They also have internet access in their lobby, 3 pc's set up, you can purchase minutes at the desk. A nice little sitting area is adjacent to the computers if you want to just sit an read or have a cup of coffee. I had gone down as they had some local artist's work up on display there. Besides I needed to get out of the room and get some air. We had rented a car as we had arrived in NYC and drove to the Poconos for a few days, then came into Manhatten. We had to park our vehicle for 3 days which ran us $78.00. That wasn't bad and it was a secure udnerground lot. All in all it was a good place to hang our hats! When we were there it had snowed and it was cold! We had great time and would stay there again.

This time we chose the Grand Union. I was very pleased. We booked through Venere - which was great because they don't charge your credit card - and their cancellation policy is great. We amended our dates 2 days before arriving with no problems - and no charge! I've never used Venere, but I will do so again - in addition, they had access to rooms where other travel sites (expedia, hotel, etc.) said were full. Enough about that - but I thought it worthwhile to mention. To start, the hotel was very clean - which is not something that usually accompanies such a bargain rate. We paid $165/night for a twin room (full size bed + single bed). When you're in town with a friend it works out to about $95/night each after taxes. Not bad for the holiday season in NYC. The Pickwick Arms charges $89 for a single (shared bath) and $109 for a single (en suite bath). That was last year's prices. No doubt they've gone up some. Add tax to that and you've got quite a bargain in the Grand Union. Our room must have been refurbished recently because it seemed like everything was fairly new - even the carpet. There were even newer windows. The room had a table/chairs, mini-fridge and cable TV. The bathroom was quite small - which was bothersome - but certainly tolerable for the price/location. The shower was EXTREMELY small (reminded me of a phone booth) and your knees were against the wall when, er, \"sitting\" in the bathroom. Very clean though. Fresh towels each day too. Water pressure was pretty low, probably due to our upper floor accomodations. But the hot water seemed readily available. Beds were firm and seemed new as well. We didn't have too much trouble sleeping after several libations, and after all, isn't that the point of these \"tourist class\" hotels? You don't get them for the creature comforts - you get them for the slightly accomodating horizontal surfaces. For the price, this is definitely the place to stay. The subway is literally right outside the door (Lex Line) and Grand Central is 10 blocks up the road. What more could you want? If you're disappointed in this hotel, I would guess that it's probably your expectations more than it is the hotel. This is a tourist class hotel. Adjust your expectations to the appropriate class of accomodations and you wont be disappointed. The staff was extremely friendly and very accomodating. We didn't have any special requests, but I'm quite certain they would have entertained any we had. The front desk clerk, a Turkish fellow, was as friendly as we could have hoped for.

Then again, if you are really savvy (or lucky) you can find real bargains and real value for many things here. In the case of hotel lodging, value is always relative to the market you're in. The Grand Union Hotel is a great value for the NYC market. My wife and I were there for 3 days on a buying trip in the garment district. Having stayed in several other hotels in the City at much higher prices and with low quality, I was searching through TripAdvisor looking for a better deal. We could have played it safe and booked at one of the well known chains or boutique hotels but what fun is that! -and unless you find a special rate their price/quality ratio is always low. Anyway, after reading the mostly favorable reviews for the Grand Union I decided to take a chance. The hotel is mostly as described. It is in a good location for touring the city(for us that is near the Garment District). The Statue of Liberty, Time Square, Macy's are all within walking distance. The room was clean and of decent size. There is a diner attached to the Lobby but they closed early (around 8pm I think) but there are plenty of other choices in the area. One problem that has been mentioned and we can confirm is the temperature regulation of the shower. Taking a shower is an adventure. The water runs from scalding hot to ice cold in a matter of seconds. Come to think of it I do recall a Spa treatment that calls for emersion in hot pools followed by cold ones so maybe this is an amenity. A minor complaint is the towels.

Not too far from Penn station either - ideal for those of you flying in to Newark - just get the train to Penn station and it's only a few blocks walk (4 I think) to the hotel. The diner next door - Captain's - was fine with friendly staff and reasonable prices for breakfast. The rooms were basic enough - bed, TV (with cable and HBO), ensuite bathroom and air conditioning. The maid service was excellent - beds made every day, towels changed (you may neeed to ask for extra towels) and bathroom cleaned daily too.

We took a city tour with New York Party Shuttle - excellent guide and good overall introduction of the sights to see/visit in New York, along with lots of history. We liked the Captain's Cafe in the hotel. We ate there for breakfasts mainly and found the food and service excellent. HOT and fast for a very reasonable price.

The maid came in every day to provide clean towels etc. If you want a clean bed and an edequate room at a budget price, this hotel fits the bills.

Our first trip to New York, we picked the hotel after reading the reviews on TA. The hotel is in a excellent location and really good value for money. We had to make 2 reservations (one for 2 nights & one for 3 nights) through two different companies as we couldn't get 5 nights in total with the same company. I called the hotel about a week before we due to arrive to double check they had a reservation for us (after reading one review on TA about someone having problems) and to advise them that we had booked via two companies and that we would prefer the same room if possible for the duration of our stay. The polite guy on reception located the reservations straight away so I didn't need to worry about the previous review. He said he would make a request on our reservations but wouldn't be able to guarantee the same room. On arrival at the Grand Union reception told us we would need to check with them after our 2nd night if we could have the same room again for the further 3 nights. Unfortunately we couldn't keep the same room but this wasn't a problem for us. We left our luggage in the secure left luggage room until our room was ready later in the day. We were told we were moving to nicer (recently decorated) room for the remainder of our stay. Couldn't fault the staff, they were always polite & cheerful. ROOMS - Very clean and comfortable. All en-suite - no need to share a bathroom The 1st room didn't have a lot of spare floor space, enough room at the end of the bed for 1 suitcase on the rack but our other suitcase we had by the side of the bed and one of us had to step over it. But the plus point was the bathroom was bigger than the second room. The bathroom in the first room had a bath with a shower overhead. The 2nd room had loads of floor space (by this time we had 3 large suitcases after all that shopping) and there was plenty of room and no need to step over any of them. But we found the bathroom a lot smaller with a shower cubicle only no bath. The shower cubicle is however on the small side, I was ok as I'm very small. This room was also located at the front of the hotel, 9th floor and we never found the street to be noisey at night. I will attach photos in a couple of days Hotel has free safety deposit boxes which are in the office behind reception. The hotel is in a excellent location with one of the 33rd street subway entrances a few yards away.

I am writing this review from my room at the Hotel. The front desk staff is not terribly friendly but not rude either. They tried to be helpful with my requests. I asked them when the hotel was built (I am in to New York History) and they looked at me like I had asked a weird question. No big deal, but they had no idea when the hotel was built or any of the history of it. If you look up at the side of the hotel from across the street you can see \"Hotel St Louis\" in washed out white paint. The hotel has 10 floors my room was on floor 9 on the street side. I am guessing that this brick hotel was built in 1920's or so. The Hotel room was slightly bigger than expected. I have stayed at other NYC hotels and know how small a room can be. This room had plenty of space for me and my wife. I had a desk that I could put my laptop on and used it while the wife watched cable TV with free HBO while she sat on the bed. This was during the time we were in the room. We were out around town most of the time. I tried to find a public wireless network with my laptop and did locate a few but the signal strength was to low to be much use. So I used my Cingular PCMCIA Edge card in my laptop and it worked great the whole week. Nice to have the Internet available. The laptop is my work laptop and my company provides the Cingular Edge card. The card connects my laptop to the Cingular cell tower. The account is set for unlimited use with no roaming charge ( I live in Seattle) the charge is about 70 per month. I was getting 144 k downloads and 92 k uploads from the hotel room. They do have two or three computers off the hotel lobby they use as Internet pay terminals. 2 dollars for 10 minutes or you can buy minutes in bulk for cheaper. I like my alternative better. Two ample dressers for our clothes. One dresser was built in to the furniture for the TV. A clothes rack to hang clothes from and a small fridge in the room. There was no safe in the room to put the laptop in while I was out. I put the laptop in the dresser under clothes and did not have a problem, although I did worry a bit. The room was cleaned daily by the maids, Polish women who were obviously immigrants. They were friendlier than the front desk staff. I asked what language they were speaking and they told me Polish, they also can speak Russian and English.. Even the maintenance man was a Polish speaker. While the room was large enough the bathroom was quite small\u2026 but clean. We did have problems adjusting the temperature of the shower water. The hot and cold knobs were reversed and it took several minutes to get the right temp to take a shower. The weather was warm during our stay and we used the window mounted air conditioning unit almost all night every night. When we did turn off the air con we could hear loud trucks from the street every night picking up garbage I think or it could have been noise from the Federal express terminal located at the corner. With the air con going the noise was not a problem. Again we were on the street side of the hotel. If your stay was during cold weather you would be using the window mounted unit for heat. Two blocks from the Empire State Building in a regular Mid Town neighborhood with Deli\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s, MacDonald\u2019s, souvenir stores, ethnic food and office buildings. The one elevator takes some patience. It services the ten floors all by it's self and you may have to wait three or four minutes during peak times. Number 6 Lexington Ave train at 33rd Street right at the corner. Easy trip to Canal street, or upper East side Museum district. First stop towards uptown is Grand Central, from there you can go anywhere. I did walk back to the Hotel from Times Square it took just under 20 minutes. This was my wife\u2019s first trip to New York and she asked me why didn\u2019t you make reservations at the Holiday Inn or something ? I told her that we paid 140 a night for this hotel. A Holiday Inn type hotel she was thinking about in NYC would cost us at least double. She is a West coast person who does not totally appreciate New York. If you are looking for a bargain hotel in NYC and 140 to 160 a night is a bargain then this hotel will work for you. If you want a Holiday Inn experience the Grand Union will disappoint. I was satisfied and quite comfortable at the Grand Union. My wife would of preferred a more expensive hotel.

I was fortunate to get a room here at the last minute, after having read the generally positive reviews on this site. I was generally satisfied with my accomodation, and saved over over $40/night compared to what I had originally booked for a smaller room at a similar-class hotel in the same neighbourhood. As previous guests have noted, the hotel has very recently been refurbished. The carpeting and furniture appeared fairly new. The carpeting in particular was probably installed within the last month. Unfortunately, it already had some cigarette burns. That's not the fault of the hotel of course, but the availability of non-smoking rooms would help. (Despite the sign in the lobby re a non-smoking environment, I was advised that no rooms have been designated non-smoking). My room did not have a smoke smell, except on two occasions when I did smell smoke from neighbouring rooms. The bed was comfortable and the housekeeping excellent...very friendly and cooperative. (Remember to leave a tip for good service!). The new TV functioned well, and had HBO (not that I used it very much). Having a fridge in the room was a definite plus, and something that usually is only available in similar class (2*) hotels in NYC for an extra fee. Hairdryers are available at the desk. I did not need to use the A/C when I was there. (The unit in the window appeared quite old). The nights were chilly and I could have used stronger heat. It probably was sufficient for most though. The location was convenient...close to a subway stop, and Fifth Avenue. All in all, I would strongly recommend this hotel if budget accomodation is what you're looking for and the absence of non-smoking rooms is not an issue for you.

The water stank bad and sure enough I called the reception right away. They promised to fix the problem ASAP and they surely fixed the leakage quickly, but nobody ever came to clean up the mess in our bathroom (even though they said the problem was fixed). So, a big negative remark for the service in this situation. Also, we never saw any of the receptionists smiling during our stay, so it was not the most pleasant customer service experience altogether. The rooms are clean (unless you count the bad smelling water pouring from upstairs) and the location is great, less than 50 meters from a metro stop and 100 meters from Empire State building.
