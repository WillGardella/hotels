As students, we wanted something fairly cheap, and since we were only there for the weekend, did not need luxury. It was definitely not the nicest or fanciest place I have stayed but it worked for us. Room: our room had two double beds and we had a shared washroom with the floor. The room was small but decent and had a working air conditioner/fan. I did bring my own sheets, however. Over the two days we spent there a large wet spot accumulated on our floor - we never did figure out what it was, simply covered it with a comforter. The washrooms were clean enough (minus the shower), however be prepared to wait in line unless you want to get up and ready really early (before 7:30). Security: the biggest problem I had with this hotel was how unsafe I felt. Had not I been so exhausted from the trip each night I'm sure I would not have slept. The door was no thicker than an interior bedroom door in a house. It did not even actually latch, so unless it was locked it did not stay closed. The lock looked like it would pop right off with a good shoulder to the door from the outside. We returned both nights after midnight, and while staff were still on duty, we were not required to check in or show ID or anything. We were allowed to walk right in, no questions asked. We did find it a little loud, however we were right near the fire exit so all of the smokers tended to pass by our room. We were actually woken up one night by screaming outside our door. A little scary when there is no phone in the room to potentially call for help. Location: as has been mentioned in other reviews, the location was beautiful. The streets were actually tree-lined, there is a large park area nearby and it is right near the subway station. A little tricky to find by car for anyone driving in (we spent about 2 hours driving around lost), because of all the one-way streets. Parking is not available on site and is about 30 dollars a day. Overall, despite all the bad things about this hotel, it served our purpose. I would recommend it for only short stays where you do not plan to spend any time lounging in the hotel and will be too tired at the end of the day to notice its flaws.", "Date": "April 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston", "Title": "\u201cAny other budget hotel BUT this!\u201d", "Author": "freebird74", "ReviewID": "UR5898704", "Content": "This is my 1st budget hotel experience and the worst of its kind in NYC! I thought ALL budget hotels in NY were like it and glad tried 2 others recently (Look for Belnord Hotel and Grant Hotel) so now I could really make a comparison. For the price, you get what you pay for!! BUT in the 2 other hotels that I mentioned, they're far better than Mount Royal for the same price!! With that given, compared to the 2 others, Mount Royal is soo old it looks like it's gonna fall apart any minute. The sheets are old, thin, rough and really something I would NOT consider beddings. Don't even use their towels. We brought in our own towels and beddings. It's hard to sleep when you're thinking of bugs or what could be crawling underneath that old beat up bed. The venyl flooring was dirty and old and peeling. The one we stayed at had no airconditioner, only a fan. The bathrooms are relatively new but not well maintained. There are no mirrors anywhere. Going through the halls, you'd get a glimpse of how old the building is. The elevator was a scary ride- would rather use the stairs... Because I stayed at 2 other hotels for the same price recently, I had to give it a terrible rating-otherwise it's okay if you can't book anywhere else. You'd survive a day or two there once in your life and then you could say- never again!!

True, you can't expect luxury for this price, but even a hostel has to be clean! The only thing that looked clean here were the marble steps leading to the entrance. The stairs inside were made of the same marble, but only unrecognizable due to all the dirt. The room was completely bare, and stank, even the matrass stank. There wasn't even a hook to hang your towel on, well I did find a nail protruding from the wall which I used..., or a waste basket. The room itself did look like a waste basket though. The carpet was filthy, and there simply were piles of dust on the heating, which of course didn't work even though it was freezing cold in the room. Also you have the chance to get up really early... to really make something of your day... because the blinds don't close completely, which also robbed us from any privacy. Then again even if they would have shut completely, they still would have let all the light through. Thank god we only had to stay here for one night, since our hotel was overbooked. We booked the Apollo Inn, in Harlem, which obviously belongs to the same owner, only this hotel is clearly in an 'after renovation state', instead of the Mount Royal Pain in the Ass where they are just starting. I hope...Even though the neighbourhood is less friendly, this hotel was a relief. You either have to close completely if you're renovating, or stay open but still take good care of your guests, otherwise you're just out to take people for their money for which they get nothing in return.

We found the hotel easily, and the location is quite nice, only two blocks away from the metro. It is also close to a Starbucks, McDonalds, subway (sandwichbar), Dunkin Donuts and Duane Reade. Our (first) room (no. 624) was very small, and placed right next to the bathrooms. The room was not that clean, and there were hair on the sheets. We had to ask three days in a row, before the sheets were changed. We also asked for the towels to be changed, but it was on the third day we were told that we would have to have our towels replaced at the reception. The bathrooms were cleaned at least two times everyday. The problem was that not all guest would respect that they were shared - we often find urine on the toilet-seat. Some of the rooms were occupied by permanent residents, with whole familys inside. These people were quite noisy, and let their kids play around outside the rooms even quite late in the evening. One night we woke up because of strange noises from the walls. Turning on the light revealed that there had been some kind of damage to a waterpipe, and there was water coming out from the walls. My duffle-bag had quite a lot of water on it, but fortunately I had it closed. The next morning we asked for a new room , and was told to come back a 9 in the morning. We got a new room on the first floor (no 114), which was much nicer than our first room. The second room had a desk, and much more space. The people in the reception was kind and polite.

I would have chosen for a bit more expensive hotel, with normal rooms.", "Date": "October 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "london, uk", "Title": "\u201cIt's lame, but it's cheap\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4073743", "Content": "we booked the mount royal hotel because we had no choice. our agents in the UK could find us nothing in NY for the dates we were going, due to UN conference week and NY fashion week. however, this was suggested and it was dirt cheap (Dirt being, as we came to find out, an aptly descriptive word for this hotel.) new york was hot and humid when we arrived (mid september) and the hotel has no a/c. the large fan in what was our small room just about did the job. the room was sufficiently tidy but the bathroom was absolutely filthy. we paid $100 extra for our own private bathroom for 5 nights, i.e $20 a night. this seemed worth it because we didn't want to share, but the bathroom was tiny (barely room to manouevre) and filthy. mildew and grime everywhere. you didn't want your arms to touch the walls.we asked for it to be cleaned and it was but even after a scrub it still looked disgusting - \"it's an old hotel\" laughed the caretaker. you bet it is. i might add that the upper west side is a great part of NY. it's a nice escape from the madness of midtown. the riverside is a 30 second walk from the hotel and it's great to relax there at night-time. midtown is 10/15 minutes by subway, and the station is a few minutes walk from the hostel. it's on 96th street which i thought would be well out of the action but it's not that far at all, bearing in mind that manhattan is a fairly small island. hotels in new york are problematic in that you have to pay big bucks to get anything moderately nice. we were two guys who just wanted to see NY, so this was sufficient and tolerable, despite it's drawbacks. but if you want to spend time in your hotel unwinding after a day out etc. then don't bother - the rooms are small, beds are metal and there's no room to relax. i would not want to stay here again and would only do so very reluctantly. if you are desperate for manhattan accomodation, on a tight budget and purely just want a place to stay then it's ok i guess. just make sure you bring your flip flops for the bathroom.", "Date": "October 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boulder, Western-Australia", "Title": "\u201cScandalous\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4067127", "Content": "Mount Royal Hotel, New York City When we travelled to New York, we thought a basic hotel with a double bed and a shower would be good enough for our four-night-stay. We found the Mount Royal Hotel. It has only one star, but seemed to be ok. Check-in-time in New York is 3 PM so we were lucky to get a room earlier, it had just been cleaned. The room had: a double bed, two bedside tables, one chair and a TV (what we did not need); it had no wardrobe, no table, no rails or hooks to hang or dry anything, no shelf to put the toiletry, no rubbish bin. The shower/toilet was so tiny there was no room to put a toilet roll (it would have become wet anyway) and no rails either. I immediatly went down to the reception and asked for a better room and was told that this was one of their best ones. My husband and I have stayed in backpackers and youth hostels a lot and know what to expect as basic. That hotel does not deserve even one star - and not the name hotel - especially not for US $ 149.00 week-nights and US $ 193.00 saturday-nights. We did not want to spoil our holidays with that hotel and went to search for another one and luckily found one nearby were we could move in the next day. We would not recommend that hotel to anyone!
