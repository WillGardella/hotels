When we went down at 9.30am it was packed so I suggest go earlier or later to breakfast. There were no bolied eggs left one morning and the lady just made us some fresh eggs- no problem.

Location is very good too, especially if you are prepared to walk a little. Open bar whole evening and afternoon with quality drinks and snacks is a fantastic bonus. Very friendly staff and very clean rooms. Rooms: 4/5 - Recently renovated, a bit design-ish and with good amenities. We had a sort of clothing rack (with plenty of hangers, 6 or 7) and a hanging textile substitute for planks (just see any IKEA catalog :) It's actually a good idea: you see all the stuff, no need for a huge closet taking up space and there's plenty of room for things. Bathroom is ok in size, nice shower and they have a good hair dryer. Nice, soft towels. Bed is quite large, very clean and matress nice and firm. The room has a safe. We had a street-side room, but the windows isolated the noise very well when shut. Only downside: the room is small, but the very high ceilings and smart layout make it feel much bigger. There's even room for a little desk and chair. There is airconditioning too, by the way. Location: 4/5 - It's near both Montmartre and Op\u00c3\u00a9ra (both about a 10-15 minutes walk). It practically means you're in the heart of touristic Paris, while the neighbourhood is still quiet and feels safe. Although near the Pigalle metro station (which seems filled with sleazy people trying to rip off tourists at night), there's none of that near the hotel. Be weary that if you come from the Op\u00c3\u00a9ra side of Paris with suitcases, that you have to walk slightly uphill to the hotel. So if you have lots of luggage, coming from the upper side (Pigalle) is better. Service: 5/5 - Ok, it's not a 5-star George V hotel on the Champs Elysees, but at this price level, the place doesn't get better: Friendly staff is very approachable, they speak good english and are willing to help out with whatever you need. The open bar is excellent: from around 2 PM until midnight you can get free drinks (non-alcoholic) and snacks of very good quality and variety. Take them up to the room as well, if you like. Wow. Especially in a city where 2 coffees and mineral waters usually cost above 10 euros in a caf\u00c3\u00a9, I believe this really adds value. Overall, the hotel never feels as if they cut corners on you to earn money: free Wi-Fi (you can get codes for multiple devices), very nice and fresh breakfast buffet (included with our stay) and generous check-out times. Final remarks: * They have cool lobby / breakfast area with ample seating room. It's a really pleasant space to sit in (unlike most hotels), especially with free drinks. * The hotel has an elevator (we didn't need it, but I can imagine a bit older people or people with lots of luggage would like that). * Free Wi-Fi in lobby and rooms with excellent signal. They even asked how many devices we wanted to use (very nice).", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat for the price\u201d", "Author": "Sazhom", "ReviewID": "UR116423527", "Content": "The nearest metro stations to this hotel are St Georges and pigalle.

The place is spotlessly clean and well maintained. We asked for a room facing the back, and we heard absolutely nothing in the way of outside noise. The only noise came from inconsiderate hotel guests who insisted on announcing themselves to the world when they returned to their rooms at night. Although the lift was out of order the week of our stay, we were on the 1st floor (2nd floor in the USA) and it posed no problem. The breakfasts were ample and there was always something to put in the belly prior to the day's events. Earlier risers got the best selection, but we found that if you asked they would provide more of everything (except hard boiled eggs...a 1/2 hour wait if not immediately available). The front desk was always helpful. The rooms are tiny, but that's the standard in Europe. The mattresses were excellent as were the pillows. The bathrooms are nice and large, but (as others have mentioned) the shower was very funky, and got water all over the floor. Just throw your used towels on the floor and that solves that problem. I should also mention that the WiFi system is booming. No problems with reception at all, but you must renew your WiFi password DAILY by getting a new one at the desk. That's kind of dumb. I forgot to mention that there is a really nice restaurant at the far end of the street. A sweet couple run it. The hotel manager described it as \"a place where the owner loves to cook\". This hotel is located a couple of blocks from the Line 12 St. Georges Metro Stop. This is not a perfect hotel, but they work very hard to please. We enjoyed our stay in the extreme!

There was no closet in the room but an open \"clothes rack\" which maybe is not the best style wise, but it was super comfy to hang clothes. The bed was a cloud, as were the pillows. Decor is modern and minimal. Hallways are VERY narrow, so a little troublesome dragging large luggage. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious, with room to spare for everybody. The staff is friendly and helpful. They gave complimentary snacks in the afternoon that included soft drinks, coffee, pastries, chips, pretzels, fruits, etc. all on the house.
