I was immediately welcomed and felt right at home. My room on the 18th floor had a beautiful view overlooking the city and was extremely spacious. Although I was traveling alone on this trip, I particularly like that the toilet and the main bath were separate - that's always helpful when traveling with the family. As an American traveling in Europe for the last three years I have become accustomed to the differences in most European hotels but it is always nice when a Marriott (or Hilton) is available and the experience is more in line with the service and quality I prefer. It is a nice location - not right in the centre - but there is easy access to public transit and it is only a short ride to the popular attractions. Some of the \"small\" things I specifically appreciated were the face cloths, quality toiletries, bathrobe/slippers, and of course the bedding/bed.

The hotel is a little out of the centre from a tourists perspective although very well connected by both RER and Metro, both just a few minutes walk away. The RER station is a simple walk away and is on Line B, which offers a direct connect to Charles de Gaulle Airport. The hotel, is big and busy with a conference centre associated with it. There seems plenty of stay at hand in the lobby area, check in was efficient and quick by very pleasant reception staff. My room was large, clean, had a king sized bed, desk to work at, tea and coffee making facilities and an empty fridge for your own drinks and snacks. My room on the 10th floor was quiet, away from the elevators, had a good view and was all I could expect. There was no WIFI in the room unfortunately, internet was available via a cable which one had to pay. The hotel has a fitness centre and a business centre, neither of which I used. What I think lets the hotel down is the restaurant, breakfast is fine - the usual buffet of hot and cold options, priced between 14 to around 20 euros depending on whether you want the full hot buffet. The restaurant in the evening does not have a great menu, didn't inspire me at all so I just went out to eat. The bar area is fairly small and not inviting.

We did stay on a great rate (from bidding), so it was a good deal to begin with.

The lobby and all public spaces were in perfect shape. The room was large, with a large bath tub, a large bed, nice views, and overall a great American style hotel. This is in contrast to many Paris hotels, which are old, small, and often come with bad service (though if you want the \"Paris\" experience, those may be the way to go). Everyone spoke English. Internet was $20 euro per day, typical Marriott (still annoying though). Location: This seems to be a big debate here on Trip Advisor reading other reviews. I actually thought it was a fine location. The Metro stop is 1 block away. Metro line 6 directly takes you to the Eiffel Tower in about 10 minutes. It was also convenient to the RER to Disneyland Paris, and the opposite way to Versailles. It was really an easy 10 min Metro ride to anywhere in central Paris. Overall, I actually think the location might be a plus for this hotel. Overall I would recommend this hotel.

Near the hotel are the Catacombs, and in around 10 mins on a bike you'll be in the heart of Paris at Notre Dame, passing Montparnasse and the Jardin du Luxembourg on the way. It is definitely not in the heart of Paris and I wouldn't stay too much further south. The hotel itself is very comfortable, there is a buffet breakfast which was above-average quality. We stayed on the Executive floor, allowing us access to the Executive Lounge which was located on the conference floor. During the week, there was an exclusive breakfast (although it was not as ample as the main breakfast), snacks during the day and an evening cocktail \"hour\" which even included a hot meal. The rooms were small but clean, with the toilet and bathroom separated. Things that could be improved are having the Executive Lounge open on weekends (I was a little disappointed to miss out on the benefits because I was there over a weekend) and also the generosity of the hotel (not leaving new toiletries, leaving only one chocolate on the pillow instead of two... little things).

We arrived at CDG and took the RER train from terminal 2 to Denfert Rochereau. It took about 45 minutes and was a comfortable ride. From there, we walked 8 minutes downhill on Avenue St. Jacques to the hotel (Right side of street). We could have gotten closer with a change at the station to Glaciere, but the hassle of changing trains made our decision to walk a good one. When we checked in the pleasant clerk asked if we needed any local information, and he also called over the supervisor who introduced herself to us. I'm a platinum elite member, and we were given the red carpet treatment. They explained about the executive lounge which served breakfast until 10:30 in the morning, provided soft drinks duringthe day, an afternoon tea with pastries at 3:30, hot snacks at 5:30, along with beer and wine until 9:30 P.M. This was very convenient and the workers in the lounge were most helpful. If staying at the Marriott Rive Gauche, I would suggest the weekly metro pass (discouvert). We used the 1-5 zones pass (38.50 and runs from Monday to Sunday...Don't get this pass if you arrive on a Thursday or Friday!). With this pass we easily could navigate throughout Paris. The room 1818 was very comfortable. I really appreciated the heating/cooling system. It was really responsive. You could set the fan speed, and by cranking up or down on the thermostat, you were given instant relief. Unlike a lot of European hotels where you practically die of heat exposure, we were able to keep the temperature very comfortable at all times. The shower area was adequate, the toilet is located in a VERY small room off to the side. The bed was very comfortable and we got great sleep all four nights. There was never any hall noise!

The club sandwich was obviously pre -made, packaged and shipped and far from fresh with brown, soggy lettuce and grainy, mushy tomatoes. The worst was the sausage that my boyfriend ordered.

The room was very spacious for Paris - there was even room for a comfortable chair. The beds were quite comfortable and the entire room and bath very clean. There was the necessary equipment for making coffee or tea and the refrigerator was empty for the guest's use. That was a decided plus. Since breakfast was included in my conference rate, I took advantage of it everyday. The choices were varied and many. An omelet station was even available. Everyone I came into contact with was very pleasant and accommodating. The people who worked in the business center could not have been nicer. They were the ones you go to for everything from computer use, to printing, to borrowing bottle/wine openers, to electric converters. The office was always open and always pleasant and helpful. If you are looking for a typical Parisian experience, this would not be the place to go. It is much more typically American. That said, it does \"American\" very well. The location is more of a neighborhood feel than a tourist area. It is close to to metro stations and very close to bus and RER stations. Taking the RER straight in from Charles DeGaulle airport and walking the few blocks to the hotel will save a lot of money. The trip is easy and pleasant. I did it both ways and it took just under an hour. It is within walking distance to rue Daguerre, a partial pedestrian street with lots of markets open to the street as well as some cafes. If you are familiar with Paris, it has a \"rue Cler\" feel to it. Montparnasse cemetery and Parc Montsouris are within easy walking distance. Just a little farther away is the Pantheon area. It is quite easy to get to almost any major tourist site in Paris with very little need to change lines by using either metro or RER. There is a restaurant and bar in the hotel, but I did not use them. I did see a lot of other business type people in there. The elevator requires the use of your key card to go up. That certainly added to the sense of security. What are the downsides to this hotel? It was very busy - always groups coming and going (although I never had to wait long to have a question answered) It is very American - unless that's what you want. It is expensive - not the amount I would normally pay for a hotel in Paris. The wi-fi was 20 euros a day, which seemed high to me since I wasn't on a business account. You could purchase shorter amounts of time in the business center using their computers. There were several computers, but only one American keyboard - if you don't get that one, it takes longer looking for the keys. It isn't in the heart of Paris.

You do not always get that in europe in much more expensive hotels. We took the metro and we walk a ton so the location was not bad for us. Know however that the hotel is not in the middle of much action. It seems to be a safe area, a block or two from the metro. A few nearby restaurants, a ten or fifteen minute walk to more activity and probably within a half hour walk to the action of monpanarsse, or st germain des pres. In terms of value, we got it for 96 thru priceline. A real bargain. Knowing what I do now, I'd pay retail in order to stay there, just because I can feel pretty guaranteed that I will have a more comfortable stay at still a lower cost compared to other hotels.

We arrived in the afternoon and firstly had a very pleasant lunch in the restaurant. The a la carte lunch menu was quite good and the food was quite enjoyable with good sized portions. The bedroom, as a few others have commented, isn't huge but neither is it small, I suppose you could say it is adequate, but then you might ask adequate for what, well, I suppose adequate for most purposes. The bed was probably the most comfortable I have ever slept in, also it was massive, if you are planning any engagements therein I would advise you to make an appointment to meet as it mightn't happen otherwise. The bedroom window is small, you cannot open it and so have to rely on air-conditioning, quite a headache in more ways than one. The hotel is quite expensive but I suppose most are in Paris, though as part of a group we didn't have any choice in where we stayed. When you do book don't forget to ask them to run your bath - it should be ready by the time you arrive, we found out that there is very little power is left in the hot water pressure by the time it reached the 14th floor. We found the staff quite friendly. In particular, I came across Phillippe, referred to below in not very complimentary terms, on two occasions and found him most gracious and helpful. The reception staff were also quite helpful though we did come across a waiter in the 3rd floor restaurant who did not appreciate people arriving for breakfast at 9.55 am despite being explicitly told on two separate visits to reception that it was served until 11am. Served is probably a euphemism as the hot food appears to be left out in huge quantities at first light and then left to simmer until so much so that the term lukewarm is being too generous to it. In addition, the choice is quite basic whether it is cold meats (4) cereals (3) or fruit (2). The hotel appears to be located in a very safe area, we walked 20 mins to Place d'Italie and in the opposite direction a similar walk to the Pantheon with a further 10 to Notre Dame. The metro runs past the door of the hotel with two stations nearby.

This is not a typical French hotel in terms of style, decor, etc. I read several critical reviews because of its lack of charm. If you prefer a Parisienne experience, please do not pick an American hotel chain to stay in while visiting Paris. This is a high-end Marriott with a slight French charm. I normally wouldn't choose American hotel chain in Paris but I booked the room here for $112 per night through Priceline, which I think is a steal. The location is great for transpiration access but it's not in a great area for access to local sights. The metro stop is very close as is the RER. I you're not familiar with RATP, the RER is the regional train line that runs through Paris. There are several, and one stops very near the hotel - you can either walk or take the metro two stops. It's the same RER that Charles de Gaulle is on, so you can be to the airport in an hour from here. You're also a short trip for Notre Dame and Ile de Cite. The downside is that there's not much going on in the immediate area especially at night. Overall, I would definitely stay here again. I would not recommend this hotel for a first time Paris visitor unless you're here on business - just because I think here is too much to figure out in terms of sightseeing, etc. Otherwise, I think it's a great hotel, and probably one of the nicer Marriotts I've stayed in, and I would do so again at the right price point.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201ccomfortable, standard marriot\u201d", "Author": "delineation", "ReviewID": "UR121285129", "Content": "Service is professional, and the concierges knowledgeable.

Nevertheless, the hotel is excellent, and I appreciate the fact that Marriott scores on some points that you would think kind of very elementary, but still many other - even better rated - hotels can't yet get, like: - have a switch that turn off the lights near the bed - have a charger on the small desk near the bed - who doesn't use their cellphones as alarm clock and needs to charge it during the night? Other plus points: - Gym open 24h - Ice-maker machines on every floor Some points that made this hotel not get my 5 points are: - 10 \u20ac/hour for WiFi access? are you still living in the middle age of Internet connectivity? it doesn't even happen any more in African countries (no offence intended as I found excellent infrastructure sometimes in Africa). I would expect WiFi for free or nearly for free as we are approaching 2012. - several of the cardio machines in the gym were just broken - not working. In general gym is not monitored Breakfast is really nice and the personnel can (almost) all speak English which is a real plus in Paris IMHO... Location is extremely nice and easy to reach - walking distance from a metro station and you can jog to the Jardin de Luxembourg which is cool for me.

We had not been in Paris for more than 10 years and were shocked at the prices for even very simple hotels. Since we had already booked our plane tickets, there was no way to back out. Since we have been very successful in finding reasonable good quality hotels using Priceline in Canada, US and London, we thought we would try it out in Paris. We got the Marriott and were not happy when we found that it was so poorly rated for a 4 star hotel. However, we were in for a very pleasant surprise. While it is not situated in central Paris, it is a quick and cheap RER train ride from the airport. Our check-in was quick and pleasant and while our room faced the street, it is so soundproofed that we could not hear the Metro which is above ground across from the hotel. While our room was compact, it had been recently renovated (flat screen TV, very comfortable bed, loads of pillows, floor to ceiling window, clean and modern bathroom, coffee making facilities). It is a very large convention hotel but we heard no noise from the corridors. We are walkers so we found everything within walking distance of the hotel but if you're not, there is a Metro station one block away and an RER station 3 blocks away. Lots of restaurants within 5-15 minutes away. Like most large chains, it is annoying that you have to get a second mortgage to get wi-fi, but walk a few blocks and the McDonald's offers free wi-fi and the McCafe within, great espresso drinks and breakfast pastries at a fraction of the hotel price. In addition, the local bakeries and Monoprix offer perfect ingredients - baguettes, cheese, fresh fruit for a picnic lunch in Luxembourg Gardens We were in Paris during a September heat -wave (mid to high 80's). Our friends stayed at a charming small typical Parisian hotel. While the Marriott lacks such charm, it did have wonderful a/c. Our friends were offered an electric fan. All in all a quiet, pleasant stay in a large North American style hotel albeit at a North American reasonable price", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cExcellent anniversary stay\u201d", "Author": "TravelCuties", "ReviewID": "UR119492047", "Content": "DH and I returned to the Marriott to celebrate our anniversary.

Unfortunately, there were some issues with maintenance and housekeeping - the staff had to come up three times to deal with HVAC, the seal on the shower door leaked, the bathroom was less than spotless, and we got messages on the TV that the At Your Service number had trouble figuring out. Hopefully the hotel addresses these issues and gets back to top form! Everything you want from RER/metro to happy hour to the post office is at Denfert a few blocks away or keep walking north until you get to the lovely Luxembourg Gardens. If you're booking online, be sure to check back for better rates before you leave?

The room was a good size, nice sized bathroom with good shower, fridge in the room (good for buying bottles of coke rather than buying them out!!). The bed was very comfortable. We were quite disappointed by the service \u2013 long wait to check in/check out \u2013 We waited 10 minutes when we got there to check in which as I\u2019m sure you can appreciate is frustrating when you\u2019ve just arrived and want to crash or explore. The area is fantastic for the metro \u2013 there are 3 metro stations all in walking distance which makes getting around a lot easier. It takes about 30 minutes from the Gare Du Nord and probably 20 minutes to the Eiffel tower (or around 10-15euros in a taxi). The metro line the hotel is on does run above ground (including going pass the Eiffel Tower above ground!) so is quite nice to travel around on. On the first day we walked to Notre Dame, probably took us over an hour and was a good couple of kms \u2013 but we were exploring so no problem there. Essentially the main attractions of Paris are spread out along the Seine so ideally you\u2019d be close to there. There are a few restaurants in walking distance and a couple of mini-supermarkets too if you want to escape the hotel prices. The room wasn\u2019t noisy & was air conditioned. One thing I would say is, if you\u2019re not staying in Paris on business and would rather a Parisian atmosphere I would recommend staying somewhere else \u2013 there is nothing Parisian about this place; with all the Americans we could have been staying in a Marriot in Washington DC for all I knew!

We were first at the Budapest Marriott. As with that hotel, we used Marriott points to stay at the Marriott Rive Gauche Hotel. We also stayed here in 2007 when it was being renovated. We had no problem staying at this hotel and the prior review can be found on tripadvisor. Based on our good experience in Budapest we inquired about upgrading to the Executive Level in Paris. The cost was close to $100 per night rather than the $75 per night we paid in Budapest. I found out that snacks were only available five days a week rather than the seven days we had in Budapest. We decided to pass on upgrading as there was no value for us to do that. My wife noticed right away that this hotel didn't have bathrobe or slippers which she had at the Budapest Marriott. A prior post mentioned the shower 'curtain' which is a piece of glass that only covered about half the tub. It was impossible to shower without water spraying on the floor. The biggest problem continues to be the lack of free internet access which Marriott just doesn't seen to get. The charge here was about 20 euro PER DAY which came to about $29 per day. No weekly rate. It is insanity to pay that kind of money for access to the internet, especially considering the room runs about $189 per night. Friend flew in from Switzerland to visit with us for a week and stayed at a Mercure hotel. The cost was 95 euros per night which included breakfast and free WiFi. The rooms were not very much different in size. So given that Marriott continues to not provide free internet access I can't rate this hotel anything better than average and I had to fight with myself to not rate it poor.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cSoulless and expensive\u201d", "Author": "Goldilocks130", "ReviewID": "UR117269903", "Content": "A soulless place.

They were pleasant, recognized you when they saw you, and had great advice on dining, transit, and local attractions. The service alone made our stay as good as it was. The hotel itself is a little dated. Everything was in working order, but it wasn't \"fresh\". Also, our room was not in the best condition, with dirty carpet, mold growing in the bathroom and a sink that leaked all over the floor every time you turned the faucet on (which the hotel repaired during our stay). As others have written, it is a bit far from the major sights. That said, if you are a traveler who likes to explore, it's a really lovely 30 minute walk to Notre Dame, and you pass right by the Latin Quarter, Sorbonne, and several great restaurants and bakeries. The trains are right across the street if you aren't a fan of walking that far, and the Denfert Rochereau stop is one away, for easy transfers to most places in the city.

Courteous check in, with the hotel respecting our wish for two beds. The rooms were standard Marriott rooms. We had a view facing the street on the 6th floor. We had no noise at all. The beds were comfortable. The room had enough space for two with suitcases. The closet is a little tight for hanging things. There is an iron and board, a mini-fridge, a tea kettle with instant coffee and tea bags. The were refreshed daily. The TV was a good size with plenty of channels. The desk was good for working. I LOVE the ice machine on each floor. The bathroom was a WC separate from the sink and tub. The tub had a half wall (glass) enclosure for showers. Plenty of hot water, although the water pressure was not always fantastic. They replenished toiletries as needed. Housekeeping was good. I called for a robe and they brought it up right away. Along with slippers. Our AC went out one evening and we had a warm night. I asked for it to be repaired, but it was not, so the next evening when I came back at 10pm, I had to move rooms. It was a little bit of a pain, but they were properly apologetic and offered to help. (I didn't want help- I didn't want to have to pack everything in the suitcase again.) The new room was even better than the first because by now I was alone and had a great big comfy king size bed. The meal I had in the ground floor cafe was not great. I am not sure I would eat there again. I did take out coffee and a breakfast pastry several times and that was reasonably priced and good. The staff was cordial each and every time. The concierge desk had long waits, even though the hotel was not crowded. This was my fifth or sixth stay here and this has always, always, always been a problem. No free wifi, or newspapers. You have to go to the business center to pick up a copy of Marriott's news flyers. I like the neighborhood and the convenience to public transportation. (Take the bus- better views and it's not hard.) Also consider Denfert Rochereau metro/RER stop as it is might be more convenient for many journeys and is only a tiny bit further than the St Jacques metro stop.

The hotel thoughtfully placed our rooms close together on a high floor (15th - awesome views of the city). We stayed with our older teenagers who also enjoyed the hotel. It caters to business tourists and high-end leisure travelers. Families with younger children will not see some of the amenities (play areas, child sitting) associated with some Marriott hotels. The staff speak impeccable English and were friendly beyond any Parisian stereotype. The concierge desk is staffed 24/7 and is frequently staffed by more than one person. I had one gentleman call an Avis location for me so I could better find it when I walked over for me. The concierge staff simply could not have been more helpful or accessible. The hotel is tastefully decorated and is connected to a full gym to which hotel guests have 24/7 access. Spend the extra money to gain access to the executive room on the 3rd floor which serves breakfast and dinner on the weekdays. It will more than pay for itself as the restaurant on the ground floor is quite pricey as are many Parisian restaurants. The hotel is located between the Glaciere and Saint-Jacques Metro stations but is very close to the Denfert-Rochereau Metro station which is important because it is an RER transfer station. You can take the RER for the same price as the Metro and arrive at Notre Dame, the Louvre, and Musee D'Orsay much more rapidly than taking the Metro. Furthermore, we took the RER to Charles De Gaulle airport much more cheaply (2 euro/person) rather than taking a limo which would have been exorbitant. The neighborhood around the hotel is populated by shops and restaurants which while not very rustic, are very pleasant. We found a bakery nearby whose bread we could not resist. There is a shopping mall about a 15 min walk away. The Latin Quarter is nearby as are the Luxembourg Gardens. About the only downside to this hotel is that it is somewhat remote with regards to Parisian sights. Metro rides to the Eiffel Tower are about 20-30 mins which are long, but tolerable.

Fortunately, i had a silver member Marriott card and when i complained about the twin-beds they gave us a suite and a pass to the executive breakfast lounge! I was impressed by their professionalism at this level... The suite was fantastic, 2 bathrooms, 2 flat screen tvs, nice view, and if i could put the bed in my suitcase i would buy it on the spot! Breakfast had great variety, i really enjoyed the omeletes made on order, although but it was crowded at this time of the year! The receptionist was very polite and when we asked him about restaurants with Eiffel Tower view he showed us on the map the available restaurants, how much it would be approximately and when we picked one he made us a reservation. It was great! I would recommend this hotel to anyone, the Marriott card is indeed appreciated. [ Tips: When you arrive at the airport try to get a card for all transports, according to the zone you want to go. Disneyland, Versailles and the airport were not at the city zones for example. We issued a weekly card (a photo was required but a photo-copy would also do) and travelled around. I think this card changed so ask there which card is the best for you. Also, we wanted to go to Trocadero station where the Eiffel Tower is for new year's eve. As the metro line near the hotel is the one that takes you directly there, we made the mistake to go to the station after 11 (so that we would be there by midnight). Wow you cannot imagine what was happening! The trains were full and we couldn't get in the first ones! We squeezed in one and we arrived 2 minutes before midnight, we almost had the change of the year in the train! Also it was mad out there :) If you plan to do so, you'd better start earlier!

However, since I carried only on checked bag and one carry on, I decided to take the RER-B from CDG to the hotel. It cost me only 8.70 Euros which is approximately $13 USD and I only had to walk for ten minutes from the Denfert-Rochereau RER station to the hotel. Compared to 15-30 Euros for a bus shuttle or 50-60 Euros for a taxi, the RER-B and the ten minutes of walking/exercise was the best choice for me. I do not recommend the RER-B from the airport, if you have more that one bag, have children with you, or if you are not up to walking with your luggage. I go a really good rate for my week at the hotel (180 Euros for the first night and 145 Euros for the other six night). My room was on the 15th floor with a fine view of the city. I could see Notre Dame Cathedral from the window. As always the king size bed was extremely comfortable and just what I needed/wanted after my nearly 9 hour flight and my ten minute walk with luggage. Everything is Paris is pricey, so, I have no complaints about the 24 Euro daily buffet breakfast. However, I passed on the 39 Euro Sunday Brunch, it just did not seem worth it to me. My only disappointment with this hotel was the limited options from the dinner menu. There are several restuarants near by. I strongly recommend that you do not go to the very first one you find located to your right, after you exist the hotel and walks a few feet. I ordered a beef dish from there that came with fries. The beef /steak was inedible, I could not chew or swallow it . I was given no satisfaction by the waiter or manager for the awful beef I was served...just the bill. However, the restuarant that is immediately next to it, (sorry, I do not recall the name) was good, great pizza. The neighborhood seemed quite safe, and I am a woman who was traveling solo. The Metro system was very easy to use and 3 Metro stations were within easy walking distance 5-10 minutes. I was able to make smoooth connects to all the places I need to go, roland Garros, Printemps, Galeries Lafeyett, Notre Dame Cathedral, Champ Elysees, etc. I had originally planned to stay at the Renaissance Arc De Triomphe.

I was told that it was built in the 1970\u2019s and originally opened as a Sofitel. The room I had was quite nice, clean, large and comfortable. It was a standard quality Marriott room, as I would expect it to be. I do not know if it was an \u201cupgraded\u201d room for Platinum Elite clients. The bathroom was small, but nice, with lots of mirrors. The tub-shower combo is just the European shower hose type of shower; so do not expect it to be invigorating. The WC, as is usual in France, was in a separate little room off the bathroom. My room, 1406, had a view on the Blvd. St. Jacques side with a splendid panoramic view of the city, including the Pantheon, the Senate Rotunda in the Luxembourg Gardens, the Observatory, Sacre Coeur, Les Invalides, and the Tour Montparnasse. As it is a very large hotel, one feels quite anonymous, and you are not greeted by staff as you go in and out of the hotel as is typical in many other Marriotts, if only for security\u2019s sake. The reception/lobby area is just too big and impersonal. (Not a complaint, just an observation). You will need to use your key to access the elevator, so there is some element of security though I would say that it is not totally secure. The Concierge Lounge (on the 3rd floor) was nice and very large, but I didn\u2019t find it quite as nice as at other Marriotts. I especially cringed to see that the drinking water is poured from large open bottles instead of offering individual small bottles. The bottle caps are removed and the bottles are placed in a below-the-counter fridge such that when you try to grasp it, the easiest way is to grab it by its neck near the open top of the bottle \u2013 very unsanitary and a particular problem for those with immune-system medical issues. (Just hope that everybody sanitized their hand first). The lounge was always very crowded at breakfast and at cocktail time, and the American guests visiting it during my stay were extremely loud and annoying just at a time when you hoped to relax with a cool refreshment in a calm, quiet environment after a long day. There were only a few newspapers on the reading rack, but unlike other Marriotts, there was no stack of newspapers for guests to read and take back to their room. The service staff in the Lounge were quite nice and professional. The hotel restaurant is designed to sustain weary travelers as a convenience only. It is rather poor quality, so eat here only because you have to for some reason. I arrived a bit too late to go to lunch elsewhere and had a thick, tasteless, unappetizing, split pea soup and a Salade Paysanne of endive, potatoes, lardons, walnuts & hard-boiled egg. The Belgian Endive in the salad was brown & mildewy on the edges \u2013 way past its prime. I could hardly eat any of it. It is very expensive and not at all worth the price. The restaurants in the immediate area \u2013 pizzerias and bar restaurants \u2013 are only a little bit better. The location in the 14th is a distance from any tourist attractions, and although it is right on a metro line, the one running from Nation to the \u00c9toile, it is difficult to get anywhere to the north without changing lines once or twice or more. For example, getting to the Latin Quarter, which is nearby, necessitates 1 or 2 transfers, depending on your destination. You can get to the Eiffel Tower, and the Arc de Triomphe directly on this line. I used to live quite near to this hotel and know Paris & its metro system quite well, so it was not a problem for me, just an inconvenience. However, for those who are here for tourism and unfamiliar with the metro system, you could find yourself spending lots of time, first figuring out how, then getting to & from the tourist attractions. I do not recommend the Marriott Rive Gauche for first-time tourists to Paris, or for those who like to wander around their hotel neighborhoods. There is not much of interest in the immediate area unless you walk further down the Boulevard (turn right as you exit hotel) towards the 13th district to the Place d\u2019Italie and the charming Butte aux Cailles neighborhood. (On the Rue des Cinq Diamants there are some very inexpensive, but hearty restaurants that attract students and die-hard budget travelers, such as Chez Gladines).

The bath had a regular size tub, a rarity, and a shower with plenty of hot water and pressure and was very clean. In fact, the room was spotless and very nicely decorated. The best part might have been the bed, the king size bed!. The best bed I have ever slept on in Europe. It had a real matress, not the foam pad you usually find in hotels in this price range, A very comfortable, real matress and six, count em, six feather pillows, soft feather pillows. The sheets were exceptional, too. Very nice quality. The room had a safe, a refrigerator and an amazing view of the Panthenon, the Sacre Coure, the Oberservatory and the dome on the Invaildes. The Eiffel Tower was blocked by the tower in Montpernasse. This was a clean, very quiet, very comfortable room in a hotel that might be the perfect blend of an American and a European hotel. The staff was very helpful, especially Benoit at the concierge desk, and really went out their way to make our stay very enjoyable. Check in and out was a breeze. The location is right across the street from the number six metro line and just down the street from the RER B train that runs directly to CDG. You can be anywhere in Paris in minutes. You are also wihtin a few blocks of lots of cafes and pubs in the nice area called Renfert-Rochereaux, sorry for the spelling. Don't worry, the Metro is very easy to navigate. It takes about five mnutes to figure out. Much easier and much, much safer than NYC's subway. We ride it at all times, day and night. Make sure you get the weekly pass for 18.50 euros. If this place sounds too good to be true, it isn't. This really is the best hotel we have ever used in our 20 trips to Europe and is the best value we have ever found. Don't pass this one up. The only problem we had in eight nights there was on our last day, four of the six elevators were not working for a time. Did I mention there are six elevators, regular size elevators, big enough for you and your luggage, and other guests. lol The breakfast was exceptional but not cheap, 24 euros.

I chose it deliberately as the map showed it to be out of town, yet close to the Metro and the RER. Metro/RER tickets were really easy to buy, as the machines are bi-lingual and there aren't that many options, unlike trying to buy a train ticket in the UK. We did have to queue to check in, and it seems to be down to the fact that the receptionists are super helpful, and want to show you all the best places to go on the map you get given. Maybe they could hand this back to the concierge, who was just as knowledgeable. Our room was way up high with a great view of the city. Very little noise from the traffic, or the Metro across the road. Okay, so it wasn't huge but this is Paris, I don't expect huge rooms. Bed was huge, we actually managed to lose each other behind the masses of marshmallow-like pillows! Plus points for lots of mirrors, minus points for not putting them where there was any natural light. The bathroom was bijou, with a separate toilet - and you wouldn't want to be too big - I've been in bigger airplane toilets. And the flush was really loud - we could hear the neighbours when they flushed, which I found a bit unpleasant. But hey, it was all clean, we got fresh towels and amenities. It would have been nice if they'd taken away our coffee mugs, perhaps we were meant to rinse and re-use them. Marriotts always seem to have magnifying make up mirrors - great for make up, and also for showing all those wrinkles you didn't know were there! We only made breakfast once, and it wasn't the best out there - though it was quite late - they go on until 11am, which is very sociable. I think that's more down to the availability of ingredients - the sausages weren't bad, they hadn't been deep dried, or microwaved; the bacon was excellent, the scrambled eggs were non-existent, the potatoes were diced and sauteed; the cold cuts and cheese looked fine; there weren't many pastries left by the time we got there, and no brown bread for toasting. I can highly recommend the omelette bar though. We ate in the restaurant one night, and although the menu felt a bit limited, the burgers were fabulous and the french fries crispy. Prices are a little on the high side, same for the drinks - pretty much comparable with London. Though 40 euros for brunch seemed a bit steep for what is essentially the same as the breakfast upstairs plus a glass a bubbly. I'd like to see better separation between the bar and the eating area though - if you sit at the bar, then diners are only 5 feet away, and I dislike watching people eating. Some of the tables are even out on the reception area. We had a snack Sunday when we missed breakfast, and had to eat sitting at the bar while brunch was served behind us - the smell of roast lamb when you've a hangover is truly not a good thing. Well done to Roger in the bar for knowing what a dirty Martini is, and for making time to stop and talk even though they were shutting up shop. Husband was going to try the fitness centre, but the hangover won the fight, so can't comment. I'd happily stay here again, and this time I'll remember to take the Berocca. And this time we won't eat at the Italian on the block across the road adn we'll definitely go back to the Aussie bar.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest, Romania", "Title": "\u201cJust the name...\u201d", "Author": "bitzanu", "ReviewID": "UR101474406", "Content": "I\u2019m happy that I had a coupon code on Expedia, when I purchase this hotel.

Besides the bad location, small room, and akward bathroom I felt the front desk was trying to pull one over me. I am a Marriott Gold Member so I should get upgraded to the Executive Floor automatically but upon checking in they told me that they would not upgrade me but can sell me that room for an additional 65 Euros a night and if I dont pay that they can be making money on that room and they call sell it to someone else. After I pushed on that I wont pay and shouldnt have to pay cause it's one of the benefits of being a gold (and I wasnt rude or nasty or talking loudly) they put me on the Executive floor. I think they tried to pull one over on me and when I wouldnt budge they gave up. The reason I stay at American chains when I travel is to avoid these games! I also stay at American chains for the rooms and the simple things I am used to while traveling.

I've stayed at other Marriott properties in Europe and they were all very consistant. Thats why I wonder if this is a franchise and if it is how is it that they are keeping their Marriott flag. The rooms are tiny! The double beds are slightly bigger than a twin and much smaller than a full (this is not the case at the Hamburg Marriott or the London Marriot). The Executive Lounge is not on the same par either.. it's as if they are being frugal on the items they offer. The funniest thing I saw was that the house keeping staff just made up my bed and didnt clean any of the coffee cups (but placed the cold coffee cup which still had coffee in it back at its place!). I've been here 3 days now and they never replaced my shampoo or conditioners either. So I think the Director of Housekeeping needs to be replaced or the housekeeping staff needs to be trained.

Having stayed at the Le Meridien Etoile previously and being less than impressed, I decided to give the Marriott Rive Gauche a try. It is comparable in price and accommodations, but better than the Le Meridien. The Le Meridien is somewhat better located, however. Like many business hotels, it managed to neither offend nor impress. The hotel was clean and service was adequate. It seemed to offer a number of different services. The common areas were fairly beat-up looking and appeared to have multiple coats of paint where a full-blown renovation would have been more appropriate. My room was good sized, clean, ordorless, adequately decored, and sufficiently equipped. There was no hallway noise. Amenities were standard and included an iron/ironing board, instant coffee and tea, hair dryer, and safe. The shower was free of mildew. There was a separate toilet room. The cooling system was shut down, but room temperature was comfortable. The room did not have a useless mini-bar filled with overpriced items, but rather an empty mini-fridge. The bed was very comfortable but was soft, so if you like hard beds this could be a problem for you. Oddly, it appeared the door frame had once been ripped off as a result of the door being forced open with the safety chain attached (see photo) and glued back on. This would not be attractive for safety-conscious people. My room rate included WiFi and breakfast. WiFi worked well. The breakfast buffet was decent, but I would not have been happy to pay full price for it. But having internet and breakfast included in the \u20ac178 room price made it a value for Paris. As many reviewers have stated, it is an odd location for a big hotel. In the southern part of the city, the immediate area is primarily residential, quiet, and low key. Nevertheless, it is equidistant to two nearby train stations and about a \u20ac10 taxi ride to La Republique. For \u20ac1,70 you can ride the train to any point in the city. There are some shops and restaurants within a short walk, so you will not be isolated but if you want to be close to the action, this is not the place for you. I would recommend this hotel as a viable option for a large, full-service hotel especially if you are in Paris for business reasons.

The office booked late and there was a strike on in Paris, however for Euro 329 (exlcuding breakfast) and in this price bracket, I expected some value and service. Some examples: Cheapest toilet paper one can find. No bottled water in the room. Empty mini-bar. Blistered, brown stained, toilet seat. No city guides or any hospitality reading in the room. Cramped, very low ceilinged hallways. Scruffy slighly molded shower wall. Mould smell. The rooms are really small, and the bathroom and toilet even more so. When one showers, one has to watch out not to scratch the ceiling tiles. The toilet is seperate and very cramped too. Overall, It feels that Marriott;s service and value for money have gone down over the last year or so.

The market features fresh flowers, fresh produce, and fresh meats and seafood. Some amazing octopus eyed me from a counter. I felt as if I was seeing the \"real\" Paris. The Hotel rooms were spotlessly clean and comfortable. However one member of the cleaning staff oddly wouldn't hand out any extra roll of toilet tissue when we ran out. She murmurred something about not exceeding her quota. So you might want to keep a private stock handy. There aren't many brochures in the lobby offering tips about additional sight-seeing options. The Hotel concierge does readily hand out maps of the City. But the lobby staff doesn't volunteer any information about the availability of extra touring options. When some of our group members belatedly thought it might be fun to sign on for either the Moulin Rouge evening out or the Eiffel Tower lunch - the counter clerk tried to accommodate us, but found these tour options were already booked up for the duration of our stay.

There is also a girl that works there in the evening (not French) - she's not very nice. Automatically I speak French when I'm in France, and so I was asking her a question in French. Maybe she knows a lot of people that stay there aren't French, so she responded with \"I'm not French, so it's better to speak English with me.\" I just thought that was a bit out of place.

The locaiton of the hotel is not bad, the first 5 nights of our trip we stayed in an apartment in the 2nd arr., this was close to everything and we walked everywhere.

The area around the hotel is safe and clean with bars and restuarants in very close walking distance. I did not use the gym, but it looked wonderful.

While the location was not ideal for seeing the more major tourist attractions on your own it was OK if you chose to use the Metro (which we found to be quite efficient and easy to use). The check-in was OK but this was the longest wait that our Tour Director had at our tour hotels to get our room information. Having said that, longest wasn't really all that long. Room was clean, well-equipped and comfortable. The elevators are a bit odd since you have to put your room key in a slot to get them to run. I have seen this before but in these elevators there are floor buttons on both sides of the elevator but only a slot on one side. This caused considerable confusion when we first got into the elevator with a number of people. Nobody realized the slot was there and those of us on the side without the slot didn't even have a clue. Once you know it is there, it's not a problem. The layout of the room was a bit quirky in that the desk was about one foot out from the wall, couldn't be moved and wasted a lot of space. The view from our room was horrible, just the top of air conditioning units but fortunately we weren't there for the view from the room. Breakfast in the morning was excellent with a very large selection of hot and cold items including freshly made omelets and cooked-to-order eggs. As with every hotel on this tour getting coffee was difficult. After eating half my meal I finally had to go get someone to pour me a coffee and for my second cup I just went and got the carafe from the server's station. Europeans just don't realize how important coffee is to some of us from North America I guess. All in all, a nice hotel but I suspect my opinion may be slightly different if I had been paying full price for the room and the breakfast.

Fristly the price of a room here does NOT include internet, any type of food, and there is not any tourist attractions within walking distance that are worth going to. It is close to transit however. If you wish to use internet.. it is either 5euros for every 5 minutes.. or 20euros for 24 hours (which you can not use a portion, than use more the next day, etc).. food prices are ridiculous (18euros for a hamburger). The hotel is VERY americanized. If you are OK with that - than maybe this hotel will work.. but if your looking for french culture and traditions.. do not stay here.

The M6 is fantastic and will take you directly to the Eiffel Tower at \"Bir-Hakeim\" stop and then you can continue till the M6 ends at the Arc de Triomphe which is at station \"Charles de Gaulle Etolle\".

The M1 runs down the Champs right pass the Louvre then you can take it to the \"Nation\" which is at the other end of the M6. This will complete a loop of Paris and you can get back on the M6 to the hotel. Off the M6 is stop \"Place de Italle\" which is only two stops from the hotel and has a large modern shopping mall with a large Carrefour for food shopping.

As my husband and I had to do work while we were there, the one drawback to the hotel, we found, is the lack of free internet (the hotel charges a rather high fee).

It seems like the Marriott could offer this key service to their guests (many of whom are on business), at little cost to their bottom line. One thing I want to mention specifically is how helpful the staff were to us, as we realized too late (on the train, almost having arrived at CDG airport) after checking out, that we had left a passport and other key items in the safe in our room. One phone call had the front desk staff quickly on the case, retrieving the items from our room, and making plans to get these to us by taxi to the airport. A couple of phone calls later, this was all arranged, and the items showed up as promised in the taxi, allowing to make our flight, and saving our vacation!

Overall, our stay was satisfactory. The hotel staff is great, helpfull and friendly. We have had only good experiences with the front desk, concierge and bell staff. Hotel location is fine, just a few minutes from two stations on the 6 line. If you decide to walk downtown, it's a 25 minute walk to the Latin quarter. Using the metro, you can be everywhere within 15 minutes. As for nearby restaurants, we had dinner at L'Ourcine on saturday, a 10 minute walk from the hotel. Do ask the concierge to call and make reservations as far in advance as possible, as this place is always filled up, probably because Michelin put it on their \"Bid Gourmand\" list. There is a small 7-11 style convenience store in the direction of the St Jacques metro station which is open at night. I do however have a few remarks about the hotel. We decided to have breakfast at the hotel on sunday. The breakfast was ok. However, you have to choose between three different buffets when you enter the breakfast restaurant. There is a EUR 14, EUR 19 and EUR 24 selection. The more expensive breakfasts include more items. For EUR 14 you get just coffee, bread, butter, some pastries and jam, and for EUR 24 everything is included. However, there is just one buffet, and you are expected to only eat items included in your breakfast selection. As there is no reference whatsoever as to what is included in your selection after you have entered the restaurant this can get a bit confusing. It left us wondering wether we were allowed to take a glass of orange juice, or a slice of cheese. Why not just a single, flat-fee buffet for a reasonable price, say EUR 15? That would probably lead to more guests buying breakfast, making the buffet more cost efficient and making everyone happy. Housekeeping could do a better job. We found an empty minibar-style bottle of alcohol on the floor in our room, under the chair. As this hotel does no longer stock their minibars it left me wondering how long that bottle has been there. We had some mold in the bathroom, especially in corners on the tiling around the bathtub. A more important remark concerns the ceiling height in the (public) hallways and in the bathroom. This hotel has installed false ceilings that limit the free height in the public hallways to just 2 meters, which can get very claustrofobic, especially if you are tall. Furthermore, the sprinklers stick out from the ceiling a few centimeters, which put them in a position were I could have actually walked in to them, probably causing a nasty head wound. Fortunately, that did not happen. And I am just 1.96m in length, which is not extremely tall and fairly common. In the rooms the false ceilings are used in both the hallway area, which is common and no problem, but this hotel has also put a false ceiling in the bathroom, limiting the height to 2 meters. I could therefore not stand upright in the bathtub/shower area (which was a few centimeters above the floor) without pushing up on the ceiling plates with my head and looking straight into the ducting area above. Not very comfortable for showering as you can imagine. I ended up showering while sitting on my knees in the bathtub. Pretty uncomfortable. I find it hard to believe that these low ceilings, especially those in the public hallways, are actually permitted under current french building codes. I was under the impression that building codes and safety regulations in the EU were pretty much standardized through the Eurocodes building codes program. In the Netherlands for example, in a highrise hotel building like this, fire escape routes, which the public hallways are, would need to have a minimum free height of 2m30. Public hallways which are not part of the fire escape routes would need at least 2.1 meters of free height. 2 meters is just not enough and having sprinklers stick out of the ceiling lowers it to under 1.95, leading to an unsafe situation for taller people. Imagine having to evacuate your room in an emergency situation through a smoke filled hallway where sharp, pointy sprinklers are sticking out of the low ceiling at forehead height, invisible due to the smoke. I would have almost certainly ran into them, causing head injury. In such a situation, an event like that could leave you incapacitated or desorientated and could therefore easily turn out to be deadly. I would like to urge this hotel to check building codes and raise the height of the false ceilings and sprinklers in all public spaces accordingly. My final remark is about the Internet service, which is pretty expensive. I can not judge on the connection speed or quality. However, It still amazes me to see that hotels like this continue to charge excessive rates for a commodity like an Internet connection in this day and age. Why noy offer free wireless in the lobby and charge a small, nominal fee to use the wired connection in the room?", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berkeley, California", "Title": "\u201cPhenomenal hotel and experience!\u201d", "Author": "patai12", "ReviewID": "UR46314706", "Content": "First off, since I am about to write a gushing review, I should mention that I have no connection whatsoever to the Marriott Corporation. Second I would like to say that we absolutely loved this hotel and wholeheartedly recommend it to business or leisure travelers. We stayed in room #1619 - on the southward facing side of the building. The room ROCKED! While others have mentioned that the even-numbered rooms have a better view of Paris (which is true), there are approximately eight rooms on each floor on the odd numbered side in a \"bump out\" part of the building that are significantly larger than the other rooms we saw (we looked at several, out of curiosity). Our room was absolutely pristine. It was newly renovated and featured a supremely comfortable bed, bedding and pillows (the mattress was as comfortable as our $4,000 one at home). There was a \"black out\" screen for the window that when closed left the room virtually pitch dark - perfect for tourists from California needing deep sleep in the middle of the day. The air conditioning system was excellent: quiet yet effective and without blowing cold air on your face all night. We slept better in this room than we have in the past several years in any other room, at home or on the road. The bathroom was spectacular. Indeed, as others have mentioned, they do have those odd swinging glass doors that only cover about 2/3 of the tub length - leaving water to spray all over the floor. (Can anyone explain the logic of this design choice?) Having a fridge in the room was an excellent addition - though it was small it served its purpose: keeping our perishables nice and cold. The desk and desk chair were very comfortable. The flat screen tv was large and produced a clean, clear image. The English language options were a bit limited, but hey, how much time should you spend watching tv when you are in Paris? Then again, watching Russian language programming had its own unique entertainment value. The lobby was beautiful with lovely off-white tile on the floor, and it was also immaculately clean - as were the carpets in the hallways and pretty much every surface you could find in the hotel. We didn't spend much time in the bar, but one night they had a large group of people swing dancing. It seemed a lively place, newly decorated in a hip 1960's theme. The fitness center was free for guests and was also newly renovated (and immaculate). They also have a yoga/pilates studio - though I presume there is a charge for group classes. The hotel staff were all professional, helpful and friendly (which was especially refreshing as the stereotype about French service workers being rude is generally true). Georgina, one of the front desk workers was particularly pleasant and helpful. While the hotel is in a residential area, it takes only 2 minutes to walk to the Metro station and you can get to almost any of the main tourist spots in the city within 10-15 minutes (if you miss a train you can be sure the next one will arrive within about 3 minutes or so). The only negatives I can think of relates to the cost of various \"elective\" services which we found to be rather expensive, namely: the hotel breakfast, room service, laundry service, internet and premium tv channels.

The window in our room was tiny as it was only about three feet wide. The room itself is small. Our king size bed was only one foot from the TV cabinet. Theres a little work desk and not much walking room. The toilet is in a small room outside the bathroom. Although the hotel rooms felt dated, they felt clean and well maintained. The only think I disliked is how the housekeeping person has total disregards for our bathroom items left on the counter. When our room is made daily, bottles will end up sideways and items re-arranged. I don\u2019t expect them to organize by bathroom stuff but if you wipe the counter and makes a mess, shouldn\u2019t you at least pick it up to show you didn\u2019t do a half-assed job? Anyways, that my only fit with the hotel. Upon arriving we were surprised with a bottle of red wine placed in the room so that was a nice touch. The hotel is one block from the number 6 metro line Glaciere. When we first arrive we got off Denfert-Rochereau and we had to walk about 5 blocks. The 6 metro takes you directly to the Eiffel Tower stop and takes about 20 minutes. The hotel itself is not too close to any historic sites but the close proximity to the metro makes up for it as the 6 line is very convenient. We usually head straight to the metro every day upon leaving the hotel although we did attempt to walk to St Germain Avenue which is across the Seine River from the Louvre Museum to do some shopping. That took us over 1 hour. The gym is very modern and all the machines looked quite new. They have lots if cardio machines and weight machines and even free weights. The selection of free weights in huge and they have a light set and a heavy set. On thing that irritated me the most was when we were returning home one night from the Metro station outside the hotel. There were officers waiting to check ticket stubs and we threw ours way upon entering the original station. We were fined 25euros each and they did not even care we were tourists and did not understand French. Apparently they have signs that advise people to keep their metro tickets before getting off or something.

However, travel time wasn't an issue for us so we enjoyed ourselves. Another issue for me was in the bathroom. The tub/shower has a moveable glass partition instead of a shower curtain, something very common in Europe. The problem with this was the glass didn't meet the front wall of the shower so the spray leaked water all over the floor. We used many towels during the week, most of them to dry the bathroom floor.

I'll start with what I liked about the hotel: - The hotel has been recently renovated and the rooms, while basic, look more modern than a lot of hotels I've stayed at in Europe - The restaurant/bar in the lobby is nice for an easy and quick dinner and/or drinks - There are two Metro stops very close by with easy access to all of Paris - The staff was friendly and we had no problems finding someone who spoke English Now, for the things I didn't like: - While the rooms appeared to be clean for the most part, there seemed to be the beginnings of mold growing in some of the bathrooms (in particular, around the shower edges and on some of the WC walls) - The staff, while friendly, was not the most helpful. I tried for four weeks to get a special rate for parking. I contacted the front desk manager the first week of my stay, who gave me the impression that she could definitely find some sort of special rate for me. However, I had to continuously follow up with her to check on the status of that (she did not make much effort to get in touch with me). After FOUR weeks, I still had not gotten anything resolved and am having to follow up with her via email. Similarly, I had a problem with a bill (they charged one of my coworker's bills to my credit card), and had to talk to several people on several different occasions to get anything done (for what I assumed would be a pretty simple fix). Nothing major...just not the best customer service for anything beyond basic checking in/out. - The location is not the best, but its ok. You are definitely not staying in the hip or trendy part of Paris (which we knew going in), but the neighborhood really dies down at night. Even with that, I didn't feel unsafe walking around up until dark, but there just weren't many close options for good food, etc. Now, I know that while staying in a hotel for four weeks, pretty much anyone will find something they don't like about it. However I travel a lot with my job, and for 4-5 weeks at a time, and usually really enjoy the hotels I stay in. I just didn't find the customer service at this hotel to be up to par.

Here are some bullet points about our stay and the surrounding area: - The hotel was pleasant, beds were very comfortable and the room was quiet. We had an end room so that may have been one of the reasons why we thought it was so quiet. - The concierge(s) were always helpful and provided good information when needed about transportation options or suggestions. We did our own restaurant research so we didn't use them much for that. The one restaurant they suggested, we opted not to go to after not finding anything on the menu that we wanted. - There is a patisserie right across from the St. Jacques Metro station that is a good spot to get some pastries before you head out for the day. When you walk out of the hotel, take a left and it's on the same side of the street as the Marriott. - In the room there is a small refrigerator that the Marriott has emptied all of the typical minibar items from so hotel guests can use them. Great idea and I wish more hotels would do this instead of charging inflated prices - There is a Monoprix grocery nearby to pick up some food and drinks. Walk out of the hotel, turn right, turn right when you get to Rue de la Glaciere, it's down a block or two. - I wouldn't recommend any of the cafes right on St. Jacque near the hotel. If you go to any of them, have low expectations. We tried an Italian place nearby and it was pretty awful. Cheap, but not much better than what I could have put together with some Ragu, a microwave and a frozen pizza. - Internet is expensive at \u20ac20/day but I would suggest signing up for a Boingo.com account. For $69.95/month you get 2000 minutes on any of their networks (including iBahn, which is what Marriotts use). I also used it successfully in a few other cities in Europe.

They have these strange half doors on the tub which does a...well, half-decent job of keeping the water from the shower in. The toilet is in a separate closet--truly a wash closet (WC)--makes you realize how the term came to be. A nice plus was the empty minifridge which you may stock with you own items from the supermarket down the block. It allowed me to keep items for picnics in the parks.", "Date": "June 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat gym.

The hotel was convenient for Gare du Nord, as it was only five stops on the RER to Denfert Rochereau and a 8 minute walk or so to the hotel from there. The Pros Awesome gym. You don't see this much in Paris. Five or six treadmills, four or five ellipticals, three bikes, and lots of weight equipment. Also, the exercise machines mostly all had TVs attached to them, which was a nice feature. The gym is free and open 24 hours. Ice machine on at least the floor I was staying on. You don't see this much in Paris! The beds. They're huge and soft in a good way, with great bedding. (Not surprisingly, there's a catalog on the desk where you can order your own set of Marriott bedding.) The \"minibar\" is actually empty. There's a sign there that says that the Marriott has discovered that guests prefer to use the fridge to keep their own stuff cold. What a nice change from the signs I sometimes see that say, \"You are not allowed to keep your own things in the refrigerator.\" The Cons 14 euro continental breakfast. Interestingly, my first morning, I got a bit confused about what was continental and what wasn't, so I asked someone and they told me it didn't really matter what I took because the staff can't keep track of who's taking the continental and who's got the full buffet. (You state your preference at the door.) There are a lot of hotels in Paris where continental is included. I like that. 20 euro per day Internet charge. The staff did note that once I had signed up, I could take my laptop anywhere in the hotel and use it. I wasn't relegated to my room. I liked that. Hallways are a bit beaten up. Location. I had no idea how far I was from everything until I took a taxi back from Vendome one night. It took ages and I think it was 18 euros. In short, I wouldn't stay here again.

If this were my first time in Paris and I stayed here, I'd be a bit dissapointed in the location. The hotel is located in the 14th arrondissement, seemingly far from all the obvious tourist points and attractions. But if you're savvy with the train and the m\u00e9tro here in Paris, you will be able to go wherever you need to get to. The hotel is close to both a major station (Denchert-Rochereau - about three blocks down Saint-Jacques) and two m\u00e9tro stops (Saint-Jacques and Glaci\u00e8re - that one's closer- for the 6 line of the M\u00e9tro) If you're looking to stay somewhere quaint and romantic on a narrow street of Paris, you do not want to stay here. There is not much ambiance in the immediate area of the hotel. Walk in anyone direction about 10 to 15 minutes and you'll have your narrow streets and quaint hidden bistros. Are those areas as romantic and quaint as those in Montmatre, Marais, or anywhere in the 7th arrondissement ? Not quite. But walk North, and hit Montparnasse, and the neighborhoods are lovely, keep walking North and the Latin Quarter along with the areas around the Jardin de Luxembourg are lovely too. I say if you have an option between this Mariott and a similarly priced hotel more centrally located, I'd pick the other option - but all is not lost if you decide to stay here. Like you have read in the other reviews, the hotel is your average Marriott. A sizeable room and bathroom (separate toilet) by European standards (could be considered even large) with super comfy beds with comfy duvet and lots of pillows (often a rarity in your run-of-the-mill European hotel). For rooms: your options are queen bed or two singles (I don't think they offer two doubles unless you're in a suite). The 18th Floor is the top floor of this hotel and gives you a nice North view of the city with Montmatre and Sacr\u00e9-Coeur in the far distance (but still visible on a nice day). Day concierge service was infinitely better and better informed than those on the night shift - (i.e. concierge service at night told us that the Galeries Lafayette would be closed on Ascension day, when we went to confirm the following day with the day concierge, they told us the complete opposite, good thing we double checked!) I can't attest to the restaurant or the European brasserie but to tell you that this is Paris, so venture out and go eat elsewhere. There are so many great bistros on Boulevard du Montparnasse - which is the closest area with the better restaurants...so go there.. But also don't shy away from the few restaurants that are nearby the hotel either. An affordable breakfast can be had at any of those on Saint-Jacques if you don't want to venture too far first thing in the morning. Also there is a little \u00e9picerie (food shop) about a block down from the hotel towards the Denchert-Rochereau stop which also sells super affordable wine. You want a Bordeaux for 5 Euros? It's the place to go after a long day of sight-seeing. Bring it back with you to the hotel and toast the city! A great convenience of the hotel if you so choose to stay here, is if you have access to the executive lounge. It's roomy, modern - with happy hour beer and wine - along with a coffee machine that makes pretty good espresso, lattes and coffee. It also offers you a selection of sodas and bottled water you can take back to you room. Breakfast was decent, but not delicious. Some cheeses, breads, pastries, cold meats and fruit salad. I would have preferred to go get a pain du chocolat or a croissant at a proper place, but when you've got a whole day ahead of you - it was nice to have a place you could just go down to from your room, grab breakfast, read the paper, check your e-mail (there are three computer terminals) and go back upstairs to get ready. If you're accustomed to American type hotels, american-type service and convenience (everyone speaks english of course!), and american-style and sized rooms and you can navigate the convenient public transportation of Paris this place is for you. p.s. on a side note, if you're interested in checking out the catacombs, they're right nearby, just across the street from the Denfert-Rochereau station.", "Date": "May 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cTypical Marriott in poor location in Paris\u201d", "Author": "LWTWisconsin", "ReviewID": "UR30858801", "Content": "We were very disappointed in the location of the hotel.

The area that the Marriott is in is residential and although there are a few restaurants nearby there is nothing to do at night so we found ourselves coming back to the Hotel very late at night. The Reception staff are very nice but for checking in and checking out there is always a queue.

Very large, clean room. We had a junior suite and it was nice to have the extra room. 2 bathrooms allowed us to get out early every morning without killing each other. 2. Service was Ok. The staff tried very hard and were generally very friendly, especially the people in the Executive Lounge (see more below), who were warm and charming. On the other hand, the concierges were a mixed bag-one was charming, but eccentric, another was all business, but not very consistent-promised reservations were never made and would get huffy about it. 3. Breakfasts were very good-either in Exec Lounge or at the buffet on days shut down for holidays. 4. This is an American hotel, so people looking for amenities they would get in the US and don't want to try something new, this is the place for you. We would have preferred a more continental experience, but using points is good Issues/Concerns 1. Location. It is a train ride to all the attractions and sights in Paris.The green line stops are about 5 minutes away (Go to the Glaciere stop-it is closer than St. Jacques), but then you need to connect at least once to get to most places other than the Arch De Triumph. It is approximately a 10 minute walk to the Denfert/Rochereaux blue line stop which connects to more places and also has an RER stop for easy access to DeGaulle. Tip-do not transfer from the blue line to the green at Denfert-it is MUCH faster to walk the 10 minutes then to follow the path underground to the green line connection. Bottom line is that if you don't mind not being in the middle of everything and riding the Metro to get places, then this won't bother you since it is pretty convenient. If it is impotant that you be in the middle of the action, then select another hotel. 2. Food in the restaurant is awful, except for breakfast. 3. The Executive Lounge had some great conveniences, but some real problems, and many of them were outside of the control of the hotel. The staff was very helpful and charming, even for things they could not help with. Many of the guest were nice to talk with and interesting. Most were polite to the staff. However, several families took over the place in the evenings and proceeded to get drunk while their children took over all of the computers, drink all of the remaining soda and basically trash the place. There was food and wrappers strewn all over the place and empty wine bottles left on the tables, which was a real problem over Christmas when no one came in to clean.

That being said, don't expect to be too charmed by the surrounding neighborhood; it's fine, but very residential and just not a whole lot of note. The hotel itself is just what you'd expect from a Marriott; decent, clean rooms; very comfortable bed, etc. I loved the bed actually--none of those gross polyester blankets like at US hotels, but soft cotton duvets that were washed as frequently as the sheets. A big downer was the price of Internet; 20 euros a day, and NOT wireless (it's that iBahn plug-in thing). The breakfast buffet was great too; omlette station, etc. But again, you'll be paying 14 euros a head for that.

I was able to check in around 1300 but there was a very long line with people checking in and out. As a Marriott Rewards Platinum member, they had a room available for me at this early check in time and had upgraded me to a Champagne Suite on the 16th floor. The check in agent was extremely polite and offered me an invitation to the executive lounge (due to my Marriott status). He also explained that breakfast on Sat and Sun was served in the restaurant instead of the lounge (although there on Sunday, I did not partake of the breakfast in the restaurant on that day). The Platinium arrival gift I selected at check in was brought right up to the room. The suite itself appeared that it may have at one time been two separate rooms. It had two identical bathrooms in the living and bedroom with separate WC rooms next to each. Each room had a closet and flat screen TV. The living room had a nice couch and a desk. The bedroom had a king bed, a chair, and a dressing table. The south-facing view was lovely. The shower temperature fluctuated a bit, but it really was not an issue. Amenities were on par with a full service property. The TV remote from the bed occassionally hit the TV in the other room, but I found that more amusing than annoying (otherwise, I probably would have attempted to turn the TV in the living room towards the other direction to avoid this). The Executive Lounge was nice and large. Breakfast there was popular but well stocked with fruit, cheese, meats, breads, cereals, and most importantly pan o chocolates. Coffee, tea, water, juice, soda, and light snacks were available all day. Wine/beer was available between 1730 and 2130, although I was never there at these times to take advantage of that. Two computers with internet access and printer were available in the lounge, as well as two internet cables with free access if you bring your own laptop. The concierge was very helpful when I asked him which train station to use to get to Epernay. He wasn't sure, but he cheerfully checked for me (Gare d'Lest if you're interested - a very easy half day trip to the Avenue du Champagne). He also showed me the best way to get to the train station by metro without me even having to ask. The hotel is not located in a touristy area, but that's not a bad thing! It's still in a good part of town, with good transportation options. It is located between the Glacerie and the Saint Jacques metro stops on the ligne 6 (Glacerie is probably closer, but take whichever stop you hit first). It is also walkable from Denfert-Rochereau with access to the RER B and the ligne 4. Although a moderate walk (and slightly uphill), I found it convenient to walk to Denfert-Rochereau with my luggage to catch the RER B to Aeroport CDG. The Orly Bus stops right in front of the hotel for convenient access to Orly airport (thougth I think you may have to walk from Denfert-Rochereau if coming FROM Orly). For groceries/beverages, there is a Fran Prix on Boulevard Saint-Jacques on the opposite side of the Saint-Jacques metro stop (on the east bound side of the boulevard). There is also a Monoprix on Avenue Gerneral Leclerc at the wonderful pedestrian shopping street Rue Daguerre near Denfert-Rochereau.

At first they claimed this was a law in France and that it was a safety rule but then they offered to allow the child in the room for an additional 1200 Euro for the entire stay??? If it was a safety concern I couldn't see how 1200 euro would have fixed it but that was their stand. We simply rented our three rooms and kept the child in our room. The hotel beat themselves out of 300 Euro or so by trying to strong arm us into paying more. We would have gladly paid another 300 euro or so for the child but they were simply trying to rob us at 1200. Other than this the experience was fantastic. One final story about the Hotel. One of our friends left their camcorder in the rooms safe when they checked out and the hotel mailed it to our home in Germany free of charge. I do not believe there are many hotels that would do this anywhere in the world. This leads me to think that there was a simple misunderstanding about the child in the room.

Check in was most courteous and English was fluently spoken, which still can be a problem in France.

The price we paid for our junior suite, which actually is two rooms put together without a door between, was quite reasonable compared to hotel closer to the city centre. Between us we had to bathrooms and two toilettes there was placed in separate rooms (you\u2019ll find this in most French hotels).

The Hotel is located in the Montparnasse district, but just outside of St. Germain de Pres. The Hotel is just 2 blocks from the Metro (Glaciere) station. This is on Line 6 which is a direct route to the Eiffel Tower. Just up the street is the Denfert-Rochereau train station (RER). This is Line B which goes directly to the Luxembourg stop if you want to go to the 6th arr. It also goes to CDG airport. You will see a lot of people coming down the street with their suitcases. Upon arrival at about 3:00, I provided my Marriott rewards number and asked for a room on an upper floor. I was told I could have one of those rooms, but not until 4:30. I decided I would wait and stored my luggage. I also upgraded to the Executive Level, allowing access to the Executive Lounge. This was 50 euros per day per room. This includes: breakfast (pastry, rolls, fresh fruit, fresh juice, cereal, excellent European yogurt, coffee, tea, soda, meat, cheeses), snacks and non-alcohol drinks all day; cocktail hour from 5:30-7:30, dessert buffet from 7:30-9:30. On Sat. and Sun. breakfast is served in the restaurant, not the Executive Lounge. On those days, it was a complete buffet with hot and cold dishes. The cocktail hour is on Sun \u2013 Thurs. This included wine and beer and a hot and cold appetizer buffet. I considered it \u2018dinner\u2019 on more than one night. The upgrade also included cable internet access, normally about 20 euros per day. While the upgrade sounds like a lot of money, given the savings on the Priceline bid, it is still less than 50% of the normal rate. It should also be noted that if there are two people in the room, you automatically break even due to the price of breakfast at the restaurant which is about 22 euros. The room was very nice. It had a king size bed with very soft and substantial bedding. There was also a down puffy pad on the mattress. My only complaint is that the mattress was too soft and was not comfortable. The TV had several channels in English, however it was all news most of the time. I was able to see some other shows over the weekend such as Jay Leno. The temperature control in the room worked excellent and the air was nice and cool if desired. There was a small refrigerator that the hotel leaves empty for guest use. The closet had plenty of hangers and the dresser lots of drawer space for clothes. There was a desk with a comfortable chair and good lighting. The hotel staff was very helpful and they all spoke English. The concierge provided a lot of helpful information about transportation and how to get places. I never had to wait more than a minute or two for help. The lobby was always busy, but I never had to wait more than a minute or two for help at the reception desk or the bellhop. I had dinner in the hotel restaurant one night. The price for the dinner which included a starter, main course and 2 glasses of wine was about $50. It was delicious and also came with a small baquette and lots of butter. The staff in the Executive Lounge was also very friendly and helpful. The food for breakfast was always delicious and very fresh. The cocktail time included hot appetizers, like shrimp and chicken. It also included platters of little sandwiches, veggies and dip, a couple of salad/slaws. Also, olives and little peppers stuffed with great French cheese. The staff that worked in the room came around and filled your glasses with red or white wine which was delicious. The hotel lobby was very attractive and bright.

Usually get 2 doubles or 2 singles from the research I made before booking. Not very romantic or at least comfortable I thought in \"the city of love\". The food in the hotel restaurant was awesome. I recommend it highly. Loved it so much we ate supper there the first 2 nights! About supper, most eating establishments do not serve/open for supper until 7:00 to 7:30. Know this if you like to eat early. The hotel restaurant accommodated the early eaters too. It had easy access to transportation. The metro was very affordable and easily traversed. Granted you are not staying across from the Eiffel Tower, you are not paying that price either. The Tower and museums etc are easily accessible on the metro in 10-15 min.

Usually, I enjoy small/quaint hotels in 15th, but in this case I needed a more predictable hotel. This one was pretty much perfect for that. Now, if you're looking for local ambiance in a very \"French\" hotel, this probably isn't what you're looking for. Contrary to other reviews, it is in fact very Parisian. This hotel was built in the 70s or early 80s, I suspect, and is typical Parisian construction of the time. I'd compare the building to the old Nikko in the west part of Paris. It's built with the 70s concept of style and function. A concept that is best left in the past, but alas, Paris has quite a few buildings from that era that remain with us. Zoning and regulation make it difficult to tear down these unfortunate edifices. So we make do. Marriott took the property over a couple of years ago, according to the staff. They overhauled it and it's pretty consistent with the solid level of amenities and good service that I've come to expect from the chain. The lobby is still horrid (again, 70s architecture), but for what it is, it's ok. For the price (Euros175/night for king size bed) it was very good. Location is ok, being near St. Jacques metro station. Rue St. Jacques itself is chock-a-block with hotels and not particularly memorable, aside from being typical Paris. But the metro makes easy access to the rest of the city. I actually spent very little time in the area, using it mostly to sleep and work in the hotel, but otherwise hanging out with friends elsewhere. The general condition of the hotel is excellent. Everything is nearly new. The elevators, room furnishings (TV, coffee maker, etc.) were functional and worked properly (not always the case, especially in less than top-tier hotels). The bed was very comfortable with respectable linens, which is standard for Marriott. Bathroom was well appointed with a deepish bathtub. The toilet was in a separate closet from the bath area, as is standard in much of France. Breakfast was good and brought promptly, even a little early, which is fine for me. Food in general was better than average for what one usually gets with room service. The business functionality of the room was excellent. This is why I chose a Marriott hotel. Internet and desk space were good and allowed doing work, making phone calls, etc. I had room to hook up my MP3 player to speakers. My only minor complaint is that my voltage adapter needed to do double duty for both my phone and laptop as the power outlets did not include a US-style outlet. Marriott hotels usually include a US style outlet at or near the desk. Not a big deal, as long as you carry an adapter. Alternatively, the concierge has adapters for a small returnable deposit. Bottom line, this is a great hotel for what it is. I'd even return to it for a week of time off in Paris if the price were right. Certainly 175 Euros is great for what you get. Would I rather that it was chic or \"un hotel francais typique\", of course I would.

YIKES!! i yelled quickly in english (i forget french in a panic) and they left, my husband and i didn't get a good look at the person. i had forgot to put the deadbolt on(my bad) but usually there is a knock!!! what else.......fridge never worked even though we called about 5 times, mirror fell off the back of the door and the maintenence man yelled at me becuase i didn't call soon enough about it?? it was not my fault we were out. the executive lounge was doing a photo shoot for a brochure so all but ignored everyone in there for days--the amount of garbage they allowed to pile up on all the tables and counters each day was a bit embarrasing..... no free internet (just to use for like 5 mins.) in the executive lounge--they had the computers, and first day we could use it, but after that could not even check for a minute. free internet was something they were \"trying out\". trying to get help in the executive lounge or from a staff member next to impossible. in a nut shell, if you have been to paris before and can get a good rate and don't mind a bit of staff issues this is probably fine. if you are looking for a romantic getaway or are visiting for the first few times--best to avoid.", "Date": "November 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hawai'i", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "MauiWorldTravelers", "ReviewID": "UR10996552", "Content": "We stayed 3 nights at the Paris Marriott RGH.

The hotel is typical Marriott. It is comfortable, clean, stylish decor and very comfortable bedding. The bed is seamless with terrific linens and pillows. The rooms very large by european standards and the bathroom, while a little strangely laid out, is very good. If you are looking for charming and quaint this is not the hotel for you. If you are looking for comfortable and Marriott quality you will be happy here. We booked the hotel on Priceline for $175 per night which I think is an excellent price for Paris and the quality of the hotel. The hotel is in a decent neighborhood, but if you are looking for the charm of the West Bank this hotel is a couple of metro stops too far out. The hotel is located between two metro stops with an easy two block walk to metro. The metro is excellent and will take you anywhere with ease and inexpensively (get the 10 trip book or the day or three day pass). My complaints have more to do with the hotel staff. It took us four days and numerous calls to get a reading light bulb replaced. We also asked the desk about getting a calling card. We were told that the hotel offered sold one, however, you could not use it in your room, but had to use it in the pay phone on the street. Since it was raining and we needed paperwork for our call, this was not an acceptable solution. I suppose Marriott would rather inconvenience their guests rather than give up their overpriced profits from using your room phone for long distance calls. If you need a calling card you need to go a couple of blocks to a convenience store. Some of the staff was very helpful and friendly and other staff was less so. If you are looking for a tasteful and comfortable hotel with good access to metro this is a great hotel, depending on the price you pay.

It is not actually located in Montparnasse, but rather Denfert-Rochreau. This was not a major problem for me as I have been to Paris and France in general over 6 times. However, if you are new to Paris, this can pose a bit of a problem. There is very little to do in this area and you will inevitably need to use the Metro to get anywhere. I highly recommend the purchase of a Carte d'Orange weekly pass. (you will need a passport photo for this) I was there for 6 nights and will say that the Marriott is very clean and well kept. There is ongoing construction and improvement happening, so there may or may not be funny smells, noise, etc. All in all the room was very clean except for the time the cleaning lady left cleanser on the vanity and dirty pillow cases on our floor. I will say that the cleaning ladies have a nasty habit of waking you up at roughly 9:30 unless you have a \"do not disturb\" sign on the door. I can't be too critical of this, as i understand that they have a job to do. I never tried the room service, but the restaurant looked like an upscale brasserie. I doubt that the food would have been anything but good. I also recommend that you get to know the supermarkets. I bought chips and drinks, as it is very expensive in the minibar and in almost any paris venue. France is the land of 6 dollar cokes. As for the general staff, they all speak many different languages and are very friendly. The were always helpful and kind. In closing, there are a few things you should know: 1. Lots of Americans. It is a good place to meet people if you do not know French. 2. Mostly caters to business, so be aware that there are crowds of business people there at any given time. 3. Nice Gym, bring workout clothes if you like. 4. The trains stop running around midnight, so be wary of time. If you miss the last train, it is a long walk from central paris. 5. It is near Montparnasse, not in. If you use the Air France Bus from CDG, it is a long walk to the hotel.

The Marriott in Paris is a fantastic larger hotel and it's in a great location. Located very close to the Metro Line (3-4 minute walk at max) this place is unbeatable.

I was apprehensive to cancel my reservation in the 6th however once we arrived I was extremely impressed. After flying for 12+ hours and arriving in Paris (my husband's first trip), the Marriott was a great way to start our 2 week adventure. We were able to ease in to the European lifestyle and able to explore so many different areas of the city. The reason for this is the Metro - this metro line runs in the East-West direction whereas most other lines run North-South (look on the metro map) so we were able to transfer quite easily to other lines for all of our daily trips. In addition to the ease of the metro, the staff was superb. The concierge desk was extremely helpful in booking dinner reservations. Also, the view from the 16th floor was amazing. Very few hotels in Paris offer views of the city. Overall, I was so pleased with our stay - especially with Paris being our first city on our trip and at this price, it just can't be beat.

The bathroom was fine, with no mold or mildew, although it was not ventilated. The placement of the sink was a little awkward. The toilet was separate, which is often the case in France. The room and hall were freshly painted and carpeted. The bed linens were great. The room had a large, remote tv, accessibility to the internet through the tv, as well as wifi and cable internet connections. Selection of French, English, German tv stations (maybe other languages, too- I didn't look beyond those three) There was no clock in the room, although you could get a wake up service. Rooms had safes and a small fridge (no mini-bar). There was an iron and ironing board. The staff were very friendly, even the poor guy I forgot to tip. Everyone greeted us warmly with each contact. We drove in and used the garage- valet parking. It was 20 Euro per day, secure and videotaped. Security was visible at the hotel, with three guys clearly watching the front at all times. They checked me instantly when I pulled up to see why I was in front of the hotel. There were also cameras about. I don't know if this was normal or because the World Cup Rugby matches started while we were there. We did not use the restaurants. Maid service was fast and good. The hotel is located between St Jacques and Glaciere metro stations. Both are on the same line. There are a number of small bistro/cafes in a few minutes walk. There is a small bakery within easy walk towards St Jacques metro, but I didn't think it was very good.

Location: 30 Minutes from Gare du Nord (Eurostar terminal) taking the RER and 2 underground stops. Underground station Glaciere is 2 minutes walking from the hotel. If you are not carrying much luggage is worth taking this route, otherwise taxis would cost over \u20ac20. The underground from Glaciere takes you to Les Champs Elisees and the Eiffel tower in less than 20 minutes. I also went to Le Pigalle and it took us 40minutes including changes. Notre Dame is 10 minutes away taking the RER. The Hotel is situated south of the river. If you like to venture in Paris (we had a friend as a guide) I reccommend the velib. They are \"public bicycles\". They are available next to the hotel and you can leave them everywhere in Paris. Hotel: This Marriott is a Conference Center previously owned by Sofitel. Marriott is refurbishing the rooms. Ours had already been done but there were decorating two other rooms on our floor. There was no noise, only paint smell in the corridors in the morning. The lobby is quite large, but the reception desk is not too big. There was a group checking in when we arrived and upon queueing we were taken to a side of the desk and bypassed the group. Although I booked with my credit card, it was again requested at check in and again at check out....... how many times do they need it? Get a map from the Concierge. They will also tell you the best way to get to different areas. Bar: Modern and quiet when we where there. Staff was friendly and chatty. Only but is that the small size of beer is advertised at 25cl but the glass is a 20cl (with the size mark). The barman topped up our glasses with a smile (I like being difficult, hehe) Room: We had been upgraded at check in. I imagine that this meant that we had a view. And what a view. 17th floor of the hotel looking at Paris (could see the Sacre Coeur). Otherwise the size of the room was average. Plasma screen in the room with internet connection (\u20ac25 per day!!) and pay per view movies with language option. The selection of channels is quite good, with international news channels in different languages. Minibar is well stocked and there is a safe in the room. The bathroom is ok, with the toilet on a different 'cupboard'. The bed was a Marriott standard, comfortable and with plenty of pillows. Summarising, not an amazing room, but very convenient for business people and the views make up for it. We didn't spend much time in it anyway. Breakfast: The breakfast room is situated on the second floor. Breakfast offering is quite large with both hot and cold buffets (hit and miss with the bacon, one day the chef had decided to overcook it, the next undercook it). There is a chef preparing eggs and omelettes. I must say she was always smiling and welcoming and very good with the omelettes. My wife decided to try the boiled eggs but they have only soft boiled (almost raw) or hard boiled (even the yolk is cooked). We asked for a medium boiled eggs but apparently this was not possible!! I cannot imagine why except maybe that the eggs are not cooked by a chef but by a machine. Paris is great and this hotel was great value for money.

The hotel is now a Marriott and not a Sofitel; the rooms have all been renovated but construction is still taking place on the second floor. It should be noted that it is also recognized as one of the largest business centers in Paris. There are 18 floors and easily over 750 rooms. The lobby is always bustling with tour companies, flight crews (looks like American Airlines is connected to them) and business people. I am no stranger to Paris and wanted something in one of the more \"quiet\" sections of Paris but not too far away from the action. This hotel was perfect for our needs. The lobby is grand with marble floors and you enter facing the 24 hr. Concierges who work around the clock for the patrons. Bellhops were courteous and always helpful; openning doors and hailing cabs. The service by all of the staff (overall) was remarkably good and helped to make the hotel feel more personable, even for its grand size. Room service was very attentive and even brought my son and I a panini after our airport shuttle disaster (see other postings on avoiding ATA Beauvais Shuttle) at 3:00 am. The food was hot and well prepared. While the offerings were limited at that hour - the fact we could still get anything to nibble was quite amazing. Our room was a standard to smaller size Marriott room - typical for large city hotels. The decor is much more Amercianized then French, but boasts almost a Scandinavian style \"simplicity\" on the first floor. My room did not have a great view, but I had also booked with a great rate from Priceline. The beds were simply unbelievable! Granted they were only twin (I think) but they seemed so much fluffier with all of the down comforters and 26\"x26\" down pillows... I digress. Anyway, the room has a small fridge with the usual $50 peanuts - but they do have a small space for personal goods. The safe in the room easily fit my laptop, some cash, cards, a camera, etc. Room service was a bit noisy early in the day - and unfortunately you can hear doors closing/slamming. This was not very noticable early in the vacation because our next door neighbors were teenagers who stayed out all night. But when a tourist group arrived that awoke each day at 6:00 am - I could hear the rumble- not terrible, but noticable. Maid service tolerated the days when we decided to \"sleep in\" until 11:00 and even waited to make up our room until after 1:00 pm on a day my son met up with a friend. The room design is a bit crowded when you first enter. The toilet is seperate from the main bathroom and is on your immediate left as your enter - something that works well for my son and I - but may make some feel claustrophobic for the toilet room is small. Next door is the main bathroom with strong water pressure and a full bathtub. The water did not drain well, but we solved this problem by simply removing the stoppers completely from the tub. The bathroom was nicey decorated with three angle mirrors and the usual assortment of shampoos, soaps, etc. (*Lather) Additional nice ammenities included a fluffy bathrobe with soft towels. Guests have the option to have linens changed daily by placing cards on the bed. Once, my bathrobe was not replaced and a simple call resulted in immediate service. As you exit the bathroom the closet is on your immediate left and was able to fit our two small carry-on size suitcases plus hang our clothing. A small bar top complimented the built in closet and the mini fridge was located beneath the small bar counter. The beds - well, I could go on forever about those beds. Usually, I do not sleep well in hotels because of lower back arthritis. I am a tall guy and not that old, but usually beds are a touchy matter for me. At home, I have the Swedish foam beds and usually have a tough time at hotels with inferior mattresses. However, these beds (while small) boasted a comfortable mattress, fluffy down mattress liner, clean white linens (including fresh duvets on all) and those square European down pillows. With a personal thermostat in the room set to a nice cool temperature and the ability to black out all daylight (two sets of shade options) - well, I slept like a log. It was great!!! A desk was located at the far end of the room with internet connections and an annoying black glass table top - I kept wanting to clean the fingerprints off. The low lying dresser crossed in front of the beds with a nice large flat screen tv. Of course, the only English speaking stations were news related or MTV which was strangely split between English and German. Spanish opportunties (I am multi-lingual) were also limited to news. The TV also acted as a Wake Up service and offered the usual online opportunities to access the internet from tv, etc. It should be noted the online bill service was not very accurate - and even at check out, the bill was difficult to decipher since they had itemized each drink and food in the restaurant, etc. The Concierges appeared to be knowledgeable and understood that I was not easily \"sold\" on the patent \"tourist\" places to eat or visit. We have been to Paris several times and travel on a regular basis a few times a year. Thus, we like to be advised of \"off the path\" sorts of places or unusal \"day-to-day\" Parisian type places. We used the Concierge station for numerous purposes and were overall very pleased. I am one of those who always tips and appreciates the advice a good \"insider\" can offer. Most were excellent - with one or two exceptions - however there were almost always two on duty during the daytime openning up your options if you did not like a particular advisor. Downstairs the hotel is still undergoing renovations and the beauty stores and boutiques were all closed as they were being relocated to the second floor. However, the restaraunt R'yves was very good - expensive, but not \"over the top\" prices. The food was excellent and offered much of the traditional French dishes (Tatare, etc.) with some creativity and excellent presentation. The decor is very modern and boast a changing light scheme that is very Scandinavian in design. The wait staff were all very attentive and while one young waitress made a mistake on one of my sons lunches, she also managed to \"make a mistake' by giving him extra portions of ice cream for desert. All in all, it is a very warm and relaxed place and we enjoyed eating here. It is unusual layout to uncover about the restaurants in the hotel because there is a second floor restaurant that serves breakfast. Then, a small \"cafe\" that offers quick snacks and coffee right in front of the main restaurant which is R'yves. However, once you get the swing, it can become quite relaxing. We became wise to the layout (sadly later in the trip) and discovered that you could eat dinner at R'yves then go into one of the three lounges and watch tv on big leather sofas - or you could lounge on the sofas in the other lounge areas and have cafe or an after dinner drink with desert. It was like being in your own home! Down further is a computer room, but the prices are just too ridiculous to make this a viable option. All in all, the restaurant section is quite nice and offers a nice selection at a somewhat overpriced amount. Keep in mind though, it is much better than the terrible restaurants right outside and right next door. Beware that the local surrounding restaurants were not very good - the service and quality were particularly bad at the place right on the corner. An apparent tourist trap, the place offers terrible food and on one occassion when I complained about the steak, the waiter actually became rude with me! Buyer Beware - avoid the three restaurants right outside the hotel we both became ill on one and wasted an entire day trying to get the Immodium to kick in. We ate... the duck... Breakfast was available at the hotel and was quite nice - but cost $24 Euros per person - that was almost 30 USD at the time of my exchange. Of course, being in Paris means finding a nice little coffee place and some croissants. Unfortunately, I did not find anything close to the hotel and needed to go further. Breakfast was always an issue and we finally decided just cheaper and easier to buy our own from a little local patissere (bakery) the night before and then have them in the morning in our room. I had to forego my caffeine craze and wait until later in the day. The hotel is close to a pharmacy, dry cleaner (reasonable) and a few grocery stores. Options were open and this makes the hotel even more attractive. The hotel is also in the middle of two Metro stops (Glaciere or St. Jacques) - this is line 6 and connects with all the other lines. It paid to buy the five day Metro Visitors Pass which also got us a discount on the Open Tour *yellow. Everything was easy to access and convenient. My teenage son discovered that it is easier to take Glaciere heading out (the walk is downhill) but coming back to use St. Jacques - thus, the walk would also be downhill. Teenagers love convenience - he also noted that we passed several small stores that offered other fruits and goodies we might need for the room each day. The RER is close by and the hotel is in close walking distance to the Catacombes. This RER B train is direct to CDG and is a quick fifteen minute walk straight down the road from the hotel. Several good restaurants are also available in that area. Did I mention that the beds were super fluffy - and you will want to just run home and jump into them every time you come back! Other considerations - the room did have an iron and board. While internet access is available it is quite expensive ($8.95 euros per hour or $19.95 euros per day - a week was over $100 euros!). Don't use your Blackberry connection from home, because I just discovered this cost me over 100 USD - thus, your best bet for internet is to use one of the cafes or to do a better job then I did searching out the free local hotspots. My criticisms of the hotel are in the added costs - the restaurant, internet, drinks or anything \"extra\" will cost you more. Parking is over 20 Euro per day - but we did not bring a car and did not have this problem. However, it is important to note that the quality is also very good. Thus, while the R'yves is a bit pricey I think the quality of its food was far superior to the really bad places nearby. If you are looking for a solid US Standard 4 * Hotel, you will really be glad you booked the Rive Gauche - it is not a typical Parisian style hotel. It offers those nice comfort items and ammenities that are expected by a 4* and it strives to make the customer happy. I think a change in Management had helped make this hotel a keeper and we would certainly return there in the future.

But in general the interior is very nice (since they had renovated 10 months ago). Our hotel room faces the front of the building so we have the city view (unfortunately the Eiffel Tower is blocked by a tall office building at the Montpamasse area). We have no trouble getting around since it's on the Metro line #6 which takes you to the Eiffel Tower. And it's easy to transfer to other Metro line as well. Make sure get a City map at the concierge. By the way the concierge is very helpful. They recommended a corner cafe called L'Alouette that's about 3 blocks away and the food over there is excellent (and the wait staff speak English). The hotel room is very modern and good size in Europe standard. The bathroom is good enough. Although I did not particularly like their shower design. The bed is comfortable (all Marriott standard) and the TV selection is great (lots of news, movies and music). The hotel restaurant is nice. We had one meal in the hotel so we could not give you any suggestion there. We ate at the cafe that's right next to the hotel and it's reasonable price (but the food selections are mainly for locals). It's not hard to get from the airport to this hotel just take RER line B all the way and walk about 6 minutes from the stop. I would not recommend riding the train with big luggages.
