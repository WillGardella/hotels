The rooms were briliantly cleaned, the staff of the entire hotel were very friendly and helpful. Laura and Yanine on Reception are very helpful for local advice and where to find the quitest beaches (get a collectivo to Tulum - about \u00a31.50) and go and snorkel with Turtles and on gorgeous reefs etc. The restaurant staff of Arial (the manager) and his happy,smiling, nothing is a problem attitude team made our stay all the more better. The food was very good - much better than the majority of the touristy 'restaurants' in Playa. After trying a few (non-touristy restaurants - we didnt bother with the 'popular ones') we gave up and ate at the hotel instead. We really have to mention Fidel's cocktails. During our time in Playa Del Carmen we also stayed in a 5* Resort just up the coast - we can honestly say that Fidels cocktails were better than any of the cocktails that we had in the 5* resort (Grand Velas). Even if you are not staying at La Tortuga - go there for a couple of Fidel's cocktails - he makes a wicked Mojito - Mayan Style - it really is worth it. Whilst the hotel is situated very close to 5th avenue - its very quiet yet you can easily access the nightlife, the local beach or you can get a collectivo and be on a quiet beach on about half an hour.

When she finally understood that I needed help she called the manager, who showed up at my room unannounced and wanted to make my undone bed his office. I cannot express in how many ways this gentleman bothered me, he disrespected my privacy and never gave me a chance to express what I really needed help with.

The bad is the noise from nearby nightclubs which made it difficult for me to sleep. This must be a big problem for all hotels near the clubs and there are many. The standard plus room is pretty small. I did expect a more comfortable room for the money and thus had some difficulty viewing the hotel as a good value.

They have some great fresh juices which are not to be missed. Get one of the green one's. The restaurant is also very good for dinner. 2) Towels and passes are made available to two local beach clubs each day. My wife and I enjoyed the beach. 3) A discounted 30 minute massage also came with the room and was outstanding, absolute bliss. 4) Although close to all the tourist mayhem, the hotel has a secluded feel and the common areas are nice and comfortable. 5) The staff are very friendly, helpful and ask for suggestions to improve the experience.

First, the service is amazing. The staff remembered who we are and were constantly asking how are stay was and if there was anything they could do for us. The staff at El Bistro was friendly every morning for breakfast and for the one dinner we at there. The bartender at the poolside bar was also friendly and fun to talk to. The front desk staff was wonderful. We worked with them to take a day trip to Akumal and Tulum and they helped us figure out our options. They recommended Claudio, a taxi driver that we got for the whole day for a very reasonable price. We were very happy with this decision. They were always quick to get us new beach towels, open doors or even loan us an umbrella for the rainy nights. The hotel itself is beautiful! We loved spending time in the jacuzzi and sitting on the outdoor couches near the bar. The whole area is lush and green. The pool is very clean. It rained a few times on our trip so the pool was a bit cool but we got in for awhile. We had a second floor balcony room that overlooked the pool. The room itself wasn't large but was perfect for our needs as we didn't plan to spend much time in it. The shower was a good size and had warm water and good water pressure. The location is perfect. Just a block from all the shops and restaurants of 5th avenue and 2 blocks from the beach. It is right off Calle Corazon, a short street that is lit up at night and has a great gelato shop. We loved that our package allowed us to eat lunch and dinner off the hotel property because there are so many amazing restaurants. I would not do all-inclusive in Playa. The beach is only about 2 blocks away. La Totuga guests can get passes for free chairs and umbrellas at Mamitas Beach Club (about a 9 block walk down 5th avenue). It is large with music and fun people watching. For a quieter, smaller option get a pass from the front desk for Zenzi (about a 6 block walk the other way down 5th avenue). You have to buy a certain amount of food and beverages ($200 pesos while we were there) but the pass gets you a discount. Zenzi has beach beds that are comfortable to lounge on. We got amazing massages at La Tortuga's spa. The massage therapists listened to our needs and were cautious in areas that were sensitive for us. We could not be more impressed with La Tortuga and highly recommend this location to anyone looking to stay in Playa Del Carmen. Also, if you to Tulum, stop by their sister location at Ziggy Beach.

The pool and jacuzzi are in the central courtyard and while they're attractive, they didn't seem to get much use and they don't get much sun exposure. The short walk over to Marmitas (one of the beach clubs that they have a relationship with) was worth the trip. Although, be sure to leave early. We arrived after the crowd which meant that they were out of chairs and umbrellas. After a bit of handwaving and fuss they offered just chairs - which they ended up adding to my bill. (60 pesos didn't seem worth haggling about - but ticket holder beware). I don't blame the hotel staff for this - it seemed like scamming by the beach club cabana boys.

The location is just steps from the beach, 5th street, restaurants, bars, clubs, shopping, banks, and anything you could want in Playa.

Of course, we booked with the front desk through the remainder of our stay after we experienced La Tortuga. We had a superior junior suite and I have to recommend this to anyone considering La Tortuga. We had an in-room jacuzzi, modern accommodations, and the configuration of our room allowed us to basically open up an entire side of our room to the air. A very specific highlight of our trip and stay at La Tortuga was El Bistro, the restaurant inside/attached to the hotel. We had breakfast here every day, lunch and dinner many days.

Let us say that if you are looking for a 5 star resort and all of the modern high end finishes, with the high end price, this is not the place for you. What makes this hotel special and a 5 star hotel is the staff of both the hotel and the El Bistro, they took care of all of our requests and needs. They all remembered us by name and always went out of their way to speak to us no matter how busy they were, we feel we truely have made some friends in Mexico and look forward to seeing them all again.

They had excellent recommendations and all the food, especially the eggs ranchreo and mayan eggs were great. Send me the recipes. And thanks for ,whipping up a to go breakfast for our early tour. And to the 2 youngs ladies who worked in the lobby/front desk thanks for your help and recommendatons and to Alfredo who went out of his way to assist us and talk with us everyday...again thanks to all of you for making our stay with you so wonderful. As for the the hotel and rooms, we loved the layout and finishes of the jr suites, and if you can afford it, I would suggest getting them versuses the standard room. The private balcony and terrace are well worth the little bit of extra money they charge for these rooms. The bathrooms were well done with very nice tile finishes. Our room was on the corner facing the corner of 10th ave and 14th North, we did not experience any problem with the street noise that some other people had mentioned in their reviews. The pool area and inner courtyard, are just beautiful, the pool is a little cool, in places because of the shade in the courtyard, but after being the sun or Tulum all day it felt good to jump in and cool off before heading to the room. They have 2 beach clubs, we tried both, and neither is that far of a walk, about 10 minutes at most, but I would recommend Mamitas over the other, better beach and area to swim and enjoy ocean, the service is better also and food was very good as well plus they do not charge you for the umbella and chairs. One tip, don't give tips to your waiter, as they will want you to tip when you pay your tab. Also good job Ernesto and Alberto. All I can say is that we love it and would return, the location is great and convienient to 5th Ave, where we found some very good food on 5th Ave and just off 5th Ave, which is better in most cases and far less costly than what we would have spent to stay in a all inclusive.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frisco, TX", "Title": "\u201cGreatness\u201d", "Author": "TXGoose23", "ReviewID": "UR118162288", "Content": "This was our first venture outside of an all inclusive and we were not disappointed.

The rooms were a great combination of modern updates with some Mexican flare. The air conditioner is unbelievable. We felt like we were walking into an ice box every night when we stepped in. (Great for me, not for Megan): Upgraded bathrooms were very comfortable. Bed is comfy too. Service - The waiters in the restaurant were great. They seemed to enjoy getting to know us throughout the week. They grew to know our tenancies (lattes and machaca). The front desk (Carlos especially) is so great. They will go to any lengths to help you out. One day we needed to break a $20 USD for an excursion to Coba. They don't really do any business with cash at the desk so they didn't have any. But, Carlos, without us even asking, ran across the street to some buddy I would assume and borrowed the money to make our change. His dedication to the clients was as good of service as we could have wished for and more. Beach - La Tortuga residences are allowed to visit both Sensi and Mamitas Beach. Mamitas is far and away the superior beach. They give you a pass for 2 beach chairs and an umbrella but you have to get down there before noon to secure chairs relatively close to the water. Location - Perfectly located a block from 5th street for a quick walk for food, shopping, beach, or just a stroll to people watch. Yet, far enough away so that you don't hear any of the loud evenings from the nigh clubs or bars. Food - The breakfast is great and free everyday. We recommend the lattes and machaca plate. You also get 25% a dinner which already has much better prices than anything comparable to 5th street. Also, across the street is \"Tacos Orientales del Caribe\" which were the best pastor tacos we had all week (and for 10 pesos per taco, they were a hit). Bummer about that place is they don't serve any beer, strictly food. Still excellent though.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auburn, AL", "Title": "\u201cEdenic gem in a charming beach town\u201d", "Author": "murraba", "ReviewID": "UR117333093", "Content": "From the outside, La Tortuga is an unassuming property, albeit centrally located in Playa.

He originally told me he had wanted us to have a private dinner on the beach, but the hotel could not accommodate this so their solarium was exaggerated to be very romantic. The solarium I imagine is a great place to tan during the day, but at night it was not air conditioned, no fans, had the ice machine situated on it, and was not \"romantic\" but very hot. The waiters were great that evening, did a great desert presentation with fire, but I would have preferred just dining in the restaurant downstairs with the fans on.

From the moment we walked in we were treated so warmly by all the staff and it was like walking into an oasis the place was so beautiful. Though we are gay and shared a King bed, the staff all treated us like they would have anyone else. Everyone that works here is very warm and friendly, and clearly is happy to work there and it shows in how they treat you. Our room was in the 3rd floor and the most basic, yet was very comfortable with nearly all the amenities you could want in a room. Our only complaint was that there is no free drinking water, unlike other hotels in Mexico we've stayed at that provide a water dispenser. Everything in the room worked, the AC was very efficient, and the shower water pressure was excellent and we always had hot water instantly (both of these can be a problem in Mexico). The bed was also very comfortable, not too hard or soft which is a great compromise for one of us who is a back sleeper and the other a stomach sleeper. The included breakfast is fabulous, please do yourself a favor and venture from the eggs and bacon or pancakes to the Mexican specialties which are so much tastier. We did that every morning and everything was good. One tip- they don't say that on their menu, but their chicken enchiladas can be doused in mole sauce. If you order them, make sure to get them with mole because they are far better than in plain tomato sauce which you'll get if you don't ask for it. We compared. Also a highlight was the Machaca, which is a northern Mexican breakfast specialty of shredded dried steak and onions in scrambled eggs; it was especially delicious with the fresh tortillas it's served with. In the afternoons, we always made it a point to stop by the bar for happy hour before heading out. We had Fidel serve us every time, such a great friendly guy who was always happy to share tips about the area and who's cocktail suggestions (and preparation, of course) were always on point. One evening we also ate at the restaurant on premise, El Bistro. You get a 25% off discount the first time you dine here if you're staying at the hotel, which made a dinner here a great value. We spent $34 USD (without tip) for the two of us for a shared appetizer, two entrees and two cappuccinos. They did not charge us corkage for the bottle we had brought with us from the US, though we asked in advance. The grounds were very well taken care of, the place is beautifully designed and appointed and it all feels much more intimate than it would seem for 51 rooms. Finally, the location could hardly be better. It's so close to the heart of 5th avenue yet feels so far removed. The staff was very helpful in answering every question we had and made some good recommendations to ensure we got around the place very easily and efficiently.

I always express my feelings whether good or bad. The hotel is located a block from 5th street which is nice to stroll and 3 blocks from the beach. I heard music playing in the side street only 1 night but enjoyed as it was music from my day. It stopped at 12pm so this was okay. The rest of the nights very quite and did not hear anything even though the hotel is a block from 5th street. Also if you like a quite place in the hotel or around the pool only children 16 years and older can stay at the hotel. Love kids but I never got splashed in the pool. They have an inner courtyard which is lush in plants and flowers and a meandering pool throughout. At night it is very beautiful with all the lights and candles they lite. We stayed for 2 /12 weeks and I worried with this much time in the same hotel may end up being tiresome but not at all. The restaurant without a lie has the best quality food here and we tried most on the menu and was never disappointed. I know their is some comments in regards to the beds but found the bed very soft and my finance loved the mattress and slept and slept and slept. The staff is amazing and there to assist in anyway possible. Eduardo never stops working and he starts at 7am and most nights does not finish to 11pm. Carlos in reception is so informative about suggesting tours and places to eat that are off the beaten path and in my opinion the quality of food is better as well the prices. The staff is always smiling which I guess reflects the management of the hotel. I am not normally a smiler so this is probably why I noticed. You must try the Titi italian restaurant. I did not find the restaurants on 5th Avenue to be that great and food and drink very expensive. A diet coke was $3.00 on average. 5th Avenue was nice to walk but gets old quick as your constantly harassed by the staff at the stores while walking down the street. Some even follow you for a ways still talking. If you have thick skin then not a problem. Back to the Hotel it is amazingly clean and you do not notice the cleaning staff. Everything is very late back no one asking you to do water aerobics or swigging bear. They have a little bar by the pool and happy hour is between 1pm and 2pm and 5pm to 7pm. I don't drink but seemed popular with guests. If your going to drink water or have soda their is an OXXO down the street as the price for this is quite expensive whether in the room or restaurant. Not sure why a coke costs so much but expensive what ever restaurant you go to. Pool temperature was warm and not difficult to enter but I would think cold in the winter months. They do have a hot tub. Rooms are air-conditioned and can be controlled by yourself to a temperature that suits your needs. Room service wow, seriously you just hang up the phone and there at your door knocking. Well I think I have said more than enough but if your looking for a beautiful, clean, quiet, great staff, restaurant, pool this is definitely the place for you in Playa del Carmen.

Parking is not included but there is a parking station around the corner which is fairly inexpensive and will keep your car safe. Check in was seamless and included a welcome drink which was a nice touch, as were the towel animals with rose petals on our bed every morning. The staff were friendly and helpful when we locked ourselves out (tip: the key only unlocks the room, not the gate to the room\u2019s patio so don\u2019t lock the gate). The room was a little small but the communal pool/bar/restaurant area was beautiful, particularly at night when it\u2019s lit up with fairy lights. It is very well designed, with easy access to the pool, restaurant, bar, spa and rooms, and lots of shade during the daytime. Staff worked throughout the day to sweep poolside and remove any debris that had fallen into the water. We spent most of the day poolside, reading magazines (there is a basket of them next to the couch area), relaxing in the water and having massages at the spa. On the second night we found a little rooftop lounge area and we had some great conversations lying on the lounges and looking up at the stars. A la carte breakfast is included but the food was a bit hit and miss. One morning the food was great and another morning it wasn\u2019t so good (probably a poor choice on my part) so ask the waiter what they recommend. We also had a dinner one night at the restaurant. The dinner menu was excellent (although not Mexican) and the waitress cooked our crepes suzette dessert at our table in a very entertaining fashion. The only thing I didn\u2019t like was that a large group of guests had set up next to the restaurant and had a stereo playing loud music while we had dinner. It was probably great for them but not so much for us. When we asked the staff if they could turn the music down, they obliged but it was still quite loud. Also, the staff were a little pushy when we checked out, asking us if we would make sure to give them a good review on TripAdvisor and then sending us a follow up email to remind us to post our review. Personally, I didn\u2019t like Playa del Carmen much \u2013 too touristy and Americanised \u2013 but I didn\u2019t feel the need to leave the hotel as it was such an intimate, welcoming environment.

The menu provides a good variety of traditional Mexican breakfast as well as fresh fruits, juices, shakes , great pico de gallo and coffe. You cannot beat this breakfast. Dinning at the Bistro was also great. On our last night they prepare a special romantic table for ous and the food was amazing. We really recommend the Ceviches. The Hotel is located next to the very interesting 5th Avenue where restaurants , shops and night clubs are, but far enough to have a quiet relaxing day. The Beach club Mamitas is a great location, a bit far from the Hotel. The Staff is not as friendly as the Tortuga staff and they close very early (5:30 pm). We also spend a couple of days and one night at Cabanas Tulum which is also from La Tortuga and would really recommend it for a romantic getaway. Jose May did a great job making our stay very pleasant. Since we arrived he prepared a couple of Coco locos which he knew we enjoyed and a special breakfast table. The staff made an entertaining Margarita night where Jose May explain about Tequilas and how to prepare the delicious Mexican Drink. They also made a fun Coco Loco presentation and a Ceviche one. They were both great and fun. It was a great way to make the guest welcome and to get to know each other. We really enjoyed it.

In Mexico, you just never know what you're going to get until you arrive. My wife and I just spent a week at La Tortuga and it was dreamy. This was our first vacation in 12 years without our children and La Tortuga made it worth the wait. I won't name all the staff members, but every one of them greeted us with a smile with every encounter and went above and beyond to be sure all our needs were met. The rooms, pool, and common areas were spotless as the staff worked diligently all day. For my wife's birthday, they decorated our room, left a bottle of champagne, and arranged a special private dinner at El Bistro...and asked for NOTHING in return. The jungle-like setting around the pool made us feel like we always had the place all to ourselves. The full breakfast and service every morning at El Bistro was excellent. If you are not the all-inclusive type, like us, and need a break from the kids, like us, you will fall in love with this place. If you consider staying here and decided to stay somewhere else, consider yourself a fool...this place is positively a slam-dunk! Tips - you can walk everywhere you need to go in Playa, but when you explore the coast skip the taxis and use the ADO bus line. Beautiful, comfortable A/C buses that will take you from Tulum to Cancun for less than $5. The central station is only 2 blocks from La Tortuga. We highly recommend going to Puerto Morelos and snorkeling with the fisherman's cooperative...$25 per person for a 2-hour guided snorkel at 2 locations...incredible coral gardens and fauna...some of the best, and cheapest, snorkeling I've ever done. Eat lunch at La Playita afterwards.

Great service and information was provided for any questions we had. No one under the age of 16 is allowed at the hotel (huge plus for us). Very nice and quite retreat from the busier 5th ave.

It was such a wonderful place I figured we would be going back and would have another change at Chcichen Itza and some other park activities.

The hotel offers really relaxing common spaces around the pool, and the lounge area is great - with couches and seating that allows you to just kick back, read a book, play some pool, or just enjoy a drink next to the lazy river. The food at the restaurant was delicious, as well. The room we had was small, but perfectly sufficient for our needs and tastefully decorated. The bed was comfortable. La Tortuga has some great staff: Yinina at the front desk was welcoming and very helpful. Carlos, working in the reception area, was also very pleasant.

It's not quite check-in time, but we decide to see if we can at least have the hotel hold our luggage while we soak up the sun and walk the sugary beaches a few minutes away. As we stand before the double glass doors, a doorman cordially opens the door. \"Bienvenidos\" he says with a warm smile. The front desk attendant is standing at her desk assisting other guests, but another attendant stands as soon as she sees us enter and assures us they'll be right there to help. In less than two minutes, a server arrives with two glasses of refreshing fruit juice. \"For you,\" he says sweetly. I look past a second set of double glass doors to see an oasis of lush green tropical plants and a I breathe a sigh of relief. We've arrived at La Tortuga and I feel relaxed already. Our front desk attendant checks us in quickly (even though we've arrived a couple of hours before check-in) and a bellman shows us to our room. As we follow the bellman, we exit a busy, bustling town and enter an oasis of calm tranquility and utter peacefulness. Our room is a \"swim up\" room so our patio has steps that cascade right into the lagoon-like pool. An oversized tile shower, a well-appointed room and bath products that smell like a cool citrus breeze all become the icing on the cake celebrating our first impression of this paradise. Past the patio steps, the pool serpentines in and out of palm trees and thick tropical plants strategically placed throughout--allowing the utmost privacy for its guests. When we awake in the morning, birds sing outside and I feel like I've been transported to my very own jungle. When it's time for breakfast, we head over to El Bistro, as breakfast is included with your stay. We order the fruit plate and huevos rancheros with coffee and \"chaya\" juice (our waiters, Micky and Jose and Fidel introduced us to this healthful shake). The restaurant is open, airy and friendly (like the hotel staff). The food is tasteful and delightful. Even the bar right next to El Bistro has a friendly bartender who goes out of his way to make us feel like we're the only ones staying at La Tortuga. That's the way I'd describe La Tortuga...the staff treats you like you're their only guest. They opened our doors for us, smiled every time and offered assistance at every turn.

The room was clean and well equipped with a mini fridge, flat screen TV, soaps, shampoos, etc. Our view was lovely: over the main courtyard with the pool and El Bistro. Noise was not a concern in the room we were in, but could see how it may have been a problem on the street side of the hotel (a plus was that we did notice the french doors leading to outside block A LOT of the street noise!). For our last night we did switch rooms because that was the only way we could stay in 3rd floor jacuzzi room. In our new room the air conditioning did not work properly, so at 9:00 that night someone came up and worked for nearly an hour on the problem. Unfortunately, neither my husband or I speak Spanish, so we couldn't chat with him while he worked, but he was courteous, quick and remedied the problem. The AC stopped working well into the middle of the night, and thankfully it was our last night there, so we didn't have to deal with the issue any further. It seems that the units really work hard given the climate, which is why ours froze up and didn't work properly. My suggestion if this happens to you... ask for another room!

Within a close walk is the beach and only a block from 5th ave restaurants and shopping. The staff truly make this a remarkable experience. Jose, the hotel manager is especially attentive and the bartenders and waiters are always available for a friendly chat. They make suggestions for day trips and then check in when you return because they really do care about your experience and your trip. Fidel and Estaban were always on hand and we were on a first name basis with. The hotel is clean and well kept with staff consisently working around the clock to keep it that way. The restaurant had a terrific selection for breakfast which is included and we had dinner there as well one night which was equally good. You can arrange with the hotel for the driver to pick you up from the Cancun airport and drive you back as well which I highly recommend. You will see the tourist police on your way down to Playa. This is a good thing as they are there for the tourists' protection. They are often on the street corners on 5th ave as well. Mexico has invested quite a lot of money in this area to keep it safe and it is, even walking around at night because of this. Finally, we took the advice of La Tortuga's hotel manager and rented a car and drove down to their sister property Ziggy Beach. Really wonderful spot right on the water with happy hour all day and a beach like no other. If you're looking for a good day trip, you should put this on your list. You can rent a car or arrange for the hotel to have a driver take you down -whichever you prefer.

The Staff at El Bistro were first rate and made our Breakfasts and pool side dining some of the highlights of our trip. Also the Bartenders were so nice and generous, hooking us us up with the occaisonal free drink and making some of the best margaritas we have ever had(try the diablo!!!). The room we stayed in was right next to the restaurant but we weren't bothered by any noise. We loved the hammock, the upstairs deck and hotub, the modern look and our view of the pool/property. We weren't thrilled with the following: construction going on throughout the day (lots of loud banging going on), some of the staff didn't seem like they were there to go the extra mile for us, and our bathtub was majorly leaking for half of our stay. It took a few calls to finally have someone take care of it. Also the hottub in the public area was out of commission for a few days, and when they said it was fixed, it was still freezing (not a huge deal cause we used the one in our room). Overall, for what we paid(it was a discount package offered on their website for off-season) it was a great value and time.

There were a few key components in selecting La Tortuga: It's strong reviews on customer service from Trip Advisor, it's location in the heart of all the shops and restaurants and within walking distance to the beach, and to be situated amongst the town to learn more about the Mexican culture and food as opposed to being stuck in an all inclusive. Upon arriving to La Tortuga for our honeymoon, things got off to a rocky start. Although we were greeted with a welcome drink and by very friendly staff, we were given a room one or two classes lower than the superior suite we had requested. When we asked about it, they let us know that the room we were supposed to get was on the side with the construction (which I know is not their fault), so they were trying to be proactive and moved us to another room. Obviously, it didn't make sense to pay a premium price for a basic room so that was my issue at that time. The front desk guy (who seemed brand new) got his manager and she promptly got us in to another room. Unfortunately the new room we were moved in to had a moldy/damp smell and was smaller than the first room. She said she'd have the smell removed and take care of sprucing it up for us while we went out for a stroll and to the beach. Unfortunately, when we returned, they had forgotten about our room and the smell was still there. The other front desk lady could tell I was unhappy with the situation. She actually approached us and came to our room to see what else she could do to fix the situation. She was able to locate yet another room for us and this one was what we had initially reserved on the website with the rooftop terrace jacuzzi, but with two double beds. That was fine with us, no problem. So we switched a third and last time. Would have loved to have that room from the start at check in. Not sure why that wasn't an option especially since it was exactly what we had booked. Anyhow, they did everything possible to try to rectify the situation so I commend them for their customer service. I think due to the close proximity of Coco Bongo, there will be noise in the distance no matter what room you're in. I think that's the case for any hotel you stay at that's in that 5th or 10th vicinity of Playa. There's nothing the hotel can do about that so I recommend either bringing ear plugs or drinking more alcohol at dinner so you can pass out. Or if you can't beat 'em, join 'em! The price of our stay included free breakfast daily until 11am at The Bistro. It was great to have such an awesome restaurant immediately downstairs. Don't forget to ask for your breakfast tickets at the front desk on your way to breakfast. I recommend getting a middle priced room, as I don't think paying the premium price is worth it (during peak season). It's not a luxury style hotel, so you're truly paying for the service level and the location. Your experience is going to be the same if your'e in a suite or one of other rooms we had seen. I wanted to point out that the safe is too small to fit a laptop, however, we felt so safe there that I left out my laptop with no issues with security at all. Also, the toiletries provided by the hotel are ample and plenty. Another note, one of our days of our stay we had a minor medical situation and we needed a doctor. The very nice lady at the front desk called a doctor, got us their new address which was within walking distance, and made sure the doctor was there. When we got there he was expecting us and it helped get us in right away. Overall, our experience at La Tortuga shaped up to be a good one. The staff clearly makes this hotel what it is and I can see how they generate repeat business over and over again. Special shout out to Alfredo who is the biggest multi tasker hotel employee I've ever seen! He really works hard and exemplified strong customer service at all times. I would return to La Tortuga and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an authentic experience in the heart of a great fisherman's town looking to learn more about the Mexican culture.", "Date": "December 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Ignacio", "Title": "\u201cThey did it again!\u201d", "Author": "moondancerbelize", "ReviewID": "UR89376140", "Content": "My third trip to la torturga- and once again- amazing.

However, as we got closer to our departure date we started to notice many reviewers complaning about the noise level of the hotel due to the proximity of Coco Bongo and the street noise of 10th Avenue. We read that free upgrades were given, so we were not too concerned. Upon check -in we immediately requested a room as far away as possible from Coco Bongo, and were assured that the room was quiet. The room we were given was tiny - room enough for a full size bed and nothing else - barely room to move around, and right on 10th Avenue. After a sleepless night, we requested a room change, and were told that since we were in a \"standard\" room, we could be moved to a \"standard plus\" room, but for an additional charge. I had read other reviews where guests were given free upgrades, but we were charged. We were so exhausted and stressed that we agreed to pay the difference. We realize that the hotel is not responsible for this noise, but feel that if the hotel is not full (this was the off season) upgrades should be free. We asked Bernardo, the manager, to arrange a taxi ride for us to a destination, He quoted a price, and we were told to pay him in cash, and not the driver.

The hotel is all about customer service, the staff is well trained and very accommodating. Check in was very classy down to fruit drinks. The Hotel is in a perfect location close to the main shopping street and beaches. The hotel has a very nice courtyard with a lazy river running through it and is very lush, private and provides a quiet \"zen\" space. Many rooms are facing onto this beautiful space. The bar is the main feature of this inner courtyard and it provides a pool table and also many nice spaces to sit and read a book or have a drink. MARCO is the jewel of this bar, I have never met anyone who cares so much about the quality of service he provides and Marco makes some of the best drinks we have ever had, his \"Mojitos\" are the absolute best we have ever had. After a day or two with Marco you will think you are part of his family. The in eatery \"Le Bistro\" also had excellent staff who again really were so genuine in the friendlyness and wanting to make sure our stay perfect. Le Bistro had some of the best food in PDC and very reasonable prices, full breakfast was included in the price of our room and it was not to be missed. We also had Rambo make us a Mayan coffee one night and he truly is an artist, it was well worth the expense. As with any good hotel areas of improvement are always possible. We had a junior suite, the room was large enough, very nice bathroom, soooo very clean, the decor was very plain, the amenities were above avererage but they were cheap with towels, it was hard to figure out as they were so generous with many other things. Our first night we did not close our bathroom window properly and we were up all night because of the noise as our room faced the outside streets. When I mentioned the problem the next morning we were told to make sure our windows were closed properly as they had installed new soundproof windows, in reality they should have offered to show us another room that did not face the outside streets we were really dissapointed in how this was handled. On our last day it was raining very hard outside but no umbrella was offered by the same staff member who handled the noise complaint, we noticed as we walked around many other hotels had given there guests umbrellas that would have been nice. We also mentioned in an email to the hotel it was our birthday but that went un- noticed. No a big deal but it would have been nice to have a small fuss made...... We were offered 2 beach clubs to use during our stay, we chose Sensi and it was perfect for us.

Bernardo and Miguel up front made our stay! I was there with friends for a late birthday celebration and Bernardo arranged to have our room decorated for the occasion after a quick off-hand mention at check-in! The pool is small and covered with trees, so it's not the place to hang out for tanning and lounging in the sun, but it's a great backdrop for a drink with Marco at the bar. There is a sun deck, but again it's quite small and up a level so not by the pool. Also, the hot tub was not very hot. They tried to fix it, and we got some hot water pumped in the first time we tried, but the second time it was back to barely warmer than the pool. Mamita's, the beach club, is a ~10 minute walk away, but is quite nice once you get over there. The rooms are not spectacular but are leaps and bounds above your typical beachside hotel. We had the swim-up room, which was very cool, and it was a good size, well maintained, and had nice decor. One problem we had was that the A/C was either on or off (i.e. hot or freezing), and it drips when it's on. I really can't say enough good things about the service here.

However if you plan to stay at La Tortuga you must take the following into consideration. La Tortuga is situation off 5th Avenue, which is the main spot for shopping, restaurants and bars. If you book a room with a roof top Jacuzzi expecting to be in a world of your own you will be disappointed because all of 5th Avenue\u2019s traffic will echo, especially at night. However, that is not so bad\u2026 What gives La Tortuga a huge black eye in my opinion is the close proximity to CoCo Bongo. If you are not familiar with this club it is a rager. The club\u2019s bongo drumming and dance music permeates as if the club was downstairs at El Bistro, and trying to get some sleep was nearly impossible. My husband and I are not light sleepers. Coco Bongo raged well beyond 3am and what made matters worse was we needed to get up early to catch our flight in Cozumel the next day. I thought about calling reception and informing them about this but really what were they going to do? Move us to another room? The noise from Coco Bongo was like a storm, there was no escape. Come morning, my husband and I were miserable and angry. The hotel treat I booked for the both us blew up on my face. My husband asked me if I had read the reviews for La Tortuga and I said yes, and that most were positive. I thought the negatives were by typical annoying Americans that demand everything to be perfect and cheap no matter where they go. Well, all I wanted was some sleep and got nearly none. When we were asked by the receptionist how was our stay I informed her that we didn\u2019t get any sleep because of the club. All I got from her was, \u201cWell that\u2019s unfortunate\u201d and proceeded to hand over a bill for the drinks I ordered. Those words almost made me forget that there are nice and very friendly people that work at La Tortuga, and they genuinely care that you have a pleasant stay\u2026Perhaps her indifference comes from having heard it before and there is nothing she or the hotel can do about it\u2026 or maybe she simply didn\u2019t give a sh**. Again, to be fair the night of hell administered by CoCo Bongo was not La Tortuga\u2019s fault. But mainly the identity problem Playa Del Carmen seems to be going through. What is it?

It's a quaint little boutique hotel, just off 5th Ave. in Playa del Carmen.

Obviously, don't stay here if you're looking to step outside the room and feel your toes in the sand (Mamita's and Zenzi are beach clubs that the resort has ties with -- worked fine for us). The rooms are as diverse in amenities/size as you need them to be and the decor/layout/etc. are above average. We had the upgraded Jr. Suite with a rooftop jacuzzi that we didn't use once, but was a nice forethought. The upkeep of the flora, cleanliness and ambiance was outstanding. The pool/bar area is simply breathtaking, with flowers blooming, banana's hanging, lush, tropical landscaping, a gorgeous pool, and lots of places to lounge and relax. The entrance to the on-site restaurant (El Bistro) is mere steps from the bar. I never thought to ask and it may have nothing to do with La Tortuga itself, but the fare, staff and atmosphere of the restaurant was also outstanding. The staff at La Tortuga/El Bistro deserves their own write-up, but I'll devote this paragraph to it anyway. Santiago, Amado, Marco, Fidel, Rambo, Morgana, Dr. Oscar, Bernardo, Micky and anyone else I might be forgetting, really made this trip for us. They were over-the-top friendly and accommodating. On the last day, my wife and I spent the entire afternoon/evening sitting at the bar with Marco and Fidel, while Amado, Rambo, and others would sneak over and have shots with us. Hope it doesn't get them in trouble! It was so much fun. Marco even overheard my wife mention that she didn't get to try a fresh coconut while we were there, so he went out into the pool area and chopped two for us. He dressed them up and we drank concoctions from them. Just outstanding -- the perfect end to the trip.

Close to 5th Ave, close to excellent restaurants, close to local large grocery stores for supplies. Fidel and Marco were great bartenders. They would see us sitting on our patio and bring over our favorite cocktails.....without us even asking. Breakfast at El Bistro was good and included with room price.

We spent a night in Playa del Carmen and we were lucky enough to book our stay at La Tortuga Hotel. I wouldn't change a thing about this place. It's more of a boutique hotel which makes it private, peaceful and wonderful. Here is a rundown of some of some of our favorite stuff about the hotel and Playa del Carmen: The ROOM: we spent a bit more and booked a swim up room. This was totally worth it. The steps from our patio literally walked down into the pool. It wasn't a typical pool but more of a water path surrounded by vegetation, so it was pretty private and secluded. We ended up hanging out on our patio a lot during our stay. Overall the room was very comfortable and clean. We slept well and space-wise it was just the right size for 2 people. The MINI BAR: I was shocked to find out the price of our beers from the mini bar in our room were only $2/each. Obviously this isn't an all inclusive place but it is so much better and so worth it! Plus, I've never cracked open a mini bar in the states and been happy about the bill I've gotten on check out. The POOL: The pool area in the middle of the hotel is beautiful and meticulously cared for. There really is no large open pools but rather and handful of small pools connected by paths. This makes for both a clean fresh design and a feeling of serenity and privacy. There were both beach beds and plush beach loungers in several of the pools patios. The hotel also has several cool built in couches and benches throughout the pool. The STAFF: from the moment we arrived everyone was friendly and new our name. They handed us umbrella beverages the minute we hit the lobby for check in and the service standard never dropped from that point. That's more than I can say for some all-inclusives and bigger named/chain hotels I've been too. No KIDS: I believe the policy is that no one under the age of 16 can check into the hotel. Since we were looking for an adult escape this completely fit for us. The pools and courtyard area are just too small and quaint for kids to enjoy anyway. The PERKS: Upon check in we were giving 2 beach passes to a club at the beach. When we arrived at the beach we gave them our pass and they gave us 2 chairs and a palapa (umbrella) for shade. We also enjoyed a complimentary breakfast and the restaurant on site. I thought that would mean buffet but it was actually our choice of almost everything on their breakfast menu. The LOCATION: La Tortuga does not sit on the beach but it was a short walk down the main pedestrian drag to the beach. Even in July it was not a bad walk. I've never been to Playa del Carmen but hands down I loved it. We did Cancun last year and it was all inclusive which had it's perks but for most part wasn't satisfying. Playa del Carmen feels less resort-y and has managed to keep at least part of it's town feel. 5th is the main pedestrian drag and I was really impressed with the decor of all most all of the bars and restaurants. No plastic chairs or giant lobsters to be seen. The decor of most of the establishments was pretty chic. Also, the prices at most of the places were great. We splurged on a booze and surf and turf and only spent about $70 for 2 people. I highly recommend both Playa del Carmen and La Tortuga Hotel as a vacation destination.

Some of the Junior Suite rooms have Jacuzzis on their balcony. I think our room also offered a lot of privacy. Many of the rooms surround the pool, which is very pretty at night. Our package deal included breakfast, beach towels, and passes to two different beach clubs. The breakfast turned out to be great, especially because it was so big that we often just skipped lunch. Of the two beach clubs, we liked Mamitas better. They played better music and had better quality beach chairs and beds. The beach gets pretty crowded, so it\u2019s best to arrive by 10:30am.

The entire staff goes way above standard on how to treat their guests. We felt like part of their family by the time we left. It was very hard to say our goodbys. We want to thank the director of the hotel, Jesus. He is without doubt the best hotel manager we have ever come accross in our travels.I told him he should lead classes in the States on how managers should run a hotel. Believe me, he is star quality and others in the hotel business could learn a lot from him. We also want to thank Morgana and Berny at the reception desk for their special efforts in making our stay one of the greatest. Santago and Caamal and Carlos at breakfast were wonderful each day and we really enjoyed the meals too. We have to give special thanks to Roberto, Amando, and Paty in the restaurant also. In addition to being great servers, they were very entertaining too. The housekeeping staff was great and my wife got an excellent massage at the hotel one day. As for the hotel itself, it was perfect, exactly what we were looking for. We had a room overlooking the beautiful well taken care of pool which we also enjoyed at night. The room was very clean, we slept great and the location close to 5th Ave was within walking distance of many shops,restaurants and nightclubs. A short walk to the beach although we never made it to Mamitas. A great bonus to this property is the restaurant ; \"El Bristo\". Excellent and well prepared food. We ate outside near the pool for breakfast each day and even had some special dinners and deserts here. Again, excellent service, wonderful food at this hotel.

At first we booked a room to accommodate the five of us, as the reservation clerk said it would be sufficient for our party. To our surprise the two bedrooms were open rooms with no privacy. Two full beds upstairs and one queen bed downstairs, but the two story suite was open concept and very snug for the five of us, once we were able to view the room in person. We went to the front desk to explain the situation thinking they would not be able to accommodate our request. To our surprise they were so NICE and worked with us on finding rooms to suit our needs. They even apologized which we were not expecting because it really wasn't there fault. It was partially ours for not investigating further the lay out of the room when booking the reservation. Needless to say, they room situation for us. The rooms are smaller than what is viewed on the internet but are comfortable and cozy. The first night the air conditioner did not cool as we would have liked it to, so my husband ended up walking and buying a small traveling fan at the nearby Wal-Mart. Once we told them the next morning, they apologized and maintenance came and fixed the problem right away. The free breakfast is tasty and dinner was delicious. The bar area is right by the pool and has a computer with free internet access. The hotel is down the street from Coco Bongo and within walking distance to Quinta Avenida and the beach. We felt very safe in the area while walking and people were so friendly. Across the street was a laundry mat where the owner charged us $4.00 to wash all our clothes. She charged by the pound which was very cheap. This was great because we did not have to come back home and do all kinds of laundry.

Then, we chose La Tortuga Hotel as the location to have the actual wedding ceremony. We were definitely nervous in both decisions, but could not have been happier with both the wedding ceremony at the hotel and for choosing beautiful Playa Del Carmen. First of all, Playa is absolutely gorgeous: beautiful white beaches, warm clear blue water, wonderful restaurants, great bars and clubs and hundreds of excursions and water sports to choose from for your leisure. The Mexican people were extremely friendly and polite, ready to assist us in anyway they could. I never felt unsafe or anything like that the entire trip. Secondly, the Hotel La Tortuga will forever be a special place in our hearts. Our experience lasted 10 days and was a magical time. We had our wedding ceremony at the gorgeous pool area, right on the deck. Everyone at the hotel pitched in and it went off without any problems. It was actually very beautiful moment for us that will live in our hearts and minds forever. Roberto, fabulous waiter in the fabulous El Bistro Restaurant at the hotel, actually videotaped the entire ceremony for us. Marco made us drinks before and after the ceremony and they were perfect as always. The staff made sure everything was taken care of for our big moment, and it was. La Tortuga is a beauifully manicured hotel, very clean and well taken care of by the hard working staff on a daily basis. The service is second to none, starting with Morgana (she rocks), Bernie and Anna at the front desk will take care of everything for you from providing the beach passes to arranging a waterfront dinner at Wickey's. They strive to do everything they can to make your trip easy and stressfree. Morgana and Bernie will take great care of you. Just ask them for whatever you may need. The pool bar is a hot spot not just for happy hour, but we found ourselves partying with the best bartendar in Playa, Marco, throughout the day and evening. Marco, not only makes a great drink, but became a good friend that we truly enjoyed meeting. He is very personable and makes you the best \"Mexican Water\" in Playa. Fidel is another bartendar that was very good and polite. The restaurant, \"El Bistro\", is definitely a gem at the hotel. Your free breakfast, (is not some continental Holiday Inn) but rather a great selection of tasty dishes made to your liking and served by excellent staff members, like Daniel and Mario, to name a few. In the afternoon and evening is where you will find the restaurant amp up and come alive with the lights from \" The Jungle\", (pool area), offering a beautiful and romantic setting that is second to none. The menu is great and food is even better. There was'nt one dish we had that was not absolutely fantastic. The service you will receive is truly the five star treatment. Trust me, I know, we ate their 12 times. This is where we met our great friends Roberto, Amado and Patricia. I may be leaving out a few people, but they were all awesome. We especially loved Roberto and Amado, who took it upon themselves to be sure our stay was first class and all our needs were met above and beyond their responsibilities. We think of them as our good friends and thank them so much for taking such great care of us for 10 days. You cannot get much better than Roberto and Amado. We look forward to seeing them on our next visit, our 1 year anniversary, June 1, 2011. My only regret is that I could not catch Amado and throw him in the pool, he is too fast. The SPA at the hotel is a must. The ladies there give the best massage we have ever had, at very reasonable rates. Overall, Playa is a great choice for your vacation. You will not be disappointed with La Tortuga Hotel, whatsoever. The location is one block from the hot spot of 5th Avenue and two blocks from the beaches. It may not be right on the beach, but you will forget all about that minor detail when you experience the beauty of this little place, the phenominal service, wonderful staff, great bar and first class restaurant. Outside of the hotel, here is your guide: Go to Kool for the beach day, great service, thick padded chairs, great pool and perfect location. You are one block from the hot spots for nightlife. Coco Bongo is a show that you will never forget. Check out the watersports at Kool, there are many to choose from for very reasonable prices. Fusion is a good restaurant on the beach, of course Wickey's is the place to spend that one night out for luxury dining. Blue Parrot bar is pretty cool for lunch and in the evening. The Tequila Barrel actually has sports betting, which enhanced our stay, thanks Lakers!!! Day trip head up to Tulum. The beaches there are mind blowing. Also the ruins offer you the historical piece of your trip. Cozumel is a ferry ride away. Best bet is to rent a little car while your there and go driving up the road on your own for the day. Just remember to chill, relax and watch out for the \"Mexican Water\", it will take you to places you have never experienced. That's TEQUILA for you new people to Playa. Ask Marco, he will you show you the way.Thank you La Tortuga for a dream wedding and vacation. See you in 356 days!!!!!!

The maids were excellent in keeping the room tidy and clean and leaving towel creations on the bed for us. I think the decor and bedding could do with an upgrade. The location is perfect. Two blocks from the beach and one block from 5th Avenue, you couldn't ask for a better location. The hotel is intimate, relaxed and personal. Its not a 600 room resort on the beach. You can easily be at the beach in five minutes (walking) and 5th Avenue in one minute. Who needs an all inclusive package with so many fantastic local restaurants to chose from at great prices. This was one of the reasons we chose Tortuga as we didn't want an all inclusive package. We did eat at the hotel restaurant (El Bistro) two out of six nights but the rest we dined on or around 5th Avenue. It is very close to Congo Bongo nightclub but we didn't have any problems with the noise. All the staff are lovely and very friendly, they really go out of their way to make sure you have a fantastic holiday but they also want to get to know you. I think Mexicans are the friendliest culture I have ever met. We had a few happy hours at the hotel and Marco and Fidel were wonderful. Not only did they make fantastic cocktails but they take the time to have a conversation with you and get to know you. We enjoyed our happy hour with them. Breakfast every morning (included in the room tariff) was wonderful. We had Santiago for most of our mornings and as we couldn't speak Spanish he wrote down the basics on a piece of paper for us.

By writing this I hope I'm able to encourage honeymooners to book this trip and enjoy PDC at its best. First, let me begin by mentioning that I had some difficulty booking through pay pal. I don't think that there was anything wrong with the hotel but pay pa itself. I explained my situation to Anna, who was our contact, at that time, and they allowed me to wire over a payment. The payment didn't process before we left and I was a little anxious, but they reassured me that everything would be fine. We arrived through a hotel ordered transportation and rode the 45 minute ride through Mexico to the hotel. Our driver was Poncho and he was really cool, explaining the sites and such. But this is probably what you must of heard already. What was really noteworthy to me and my wife was the fact that they didn't annoy us because I wire did not transfer. In fact it didn't go through until the final day of our trip. Instead when I would ask every morning they would tell me to just relax and enjoy my honeymoon. That said alot. Our room was immaculate and we had the best champagne and cheese and fruit after our travel. We stayed in our room from the afternoon we arrived till late. And actually, although we took excursions to tulum and xel-ha, which is awesome awesome awesome, we really just enjoyed relaxing near the pool and bar.

The beds were comfortable and the rooms are VERY Clean. Our housekeeper, Rosa did a fantastic job! We enjoyed happy hour with Fidel and Marco almost every evening. There are two things that made this hotel awesome for me...the staff was number one. Whatever we asked for it was never more than a 2-5min wait. Things were taken care of right away. Walking around the hotel we were always greeted with a smile and Hola! The servers at El Bistro were awesome (You have to try the Apple Flambe-I had it twice). The food is also reasonably priced. The 2nd things we loved was, location, location, location! This Hotel is on 10th and 14th. It is one block away from 5th Ave and all the hussle and bussle of PDC. NEVER did we feel unsafe walking around. A few times we came back to the hotel past midnight and we always felt safe. This was our 1st time to Playa and one of our favorite trips. Not only due to location but b/c of the hotel. We met some great people that were staying there also. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

The first time we tried there was no hot water. The second time there was hot water but it took a while to fill. It just was something I didn't want to deal with on a regular basis. Our room was quite and large, sparsely decorated - but I'm okay with that. The bathroom was beautiful with a giant soaking tub/shower. Best part for me, by far, was breakfast. I had egg enchiladas every morning (the mole was great!) while my husband had yogurt and granola. The selection of fruit juices was amazing - we both settled in on the papaya as our favorite. We had the chance to eat at the restaurant for lunch and also the 5th ave location for dinner. Both of those meals were very good! The staff at the hotel were all nice. Others have mentioned problems sleeping because of the noise. I generally sleep like &%^ but slept like a baby while we were there. For me the A/C was enough to block everything out - along with general tiredness from long days in the warmth. We ended up not using either of the beach clubs that the hotel has agreements with. Mamitas wasn't our scene. Zenzi looked great but they had more of a futon style loungers that you couldn't really reposition to stay in the shade (a must for both of us!). We ended up spending 3 days at Wicky's next to Zenzi. That was fine for us - decent food, somewhat slow - but friendly service, and good, low key live music. At Wicky's you paid 50 pesos for an umbrella and then you had to spend at least 100 pesos per person on food/drink.

The entire staff is helpful, friendly and looks like they enjoy being there! The hotel itself is gorgeous. From the moment you walk in you forget that you aren't ON the beach. The pool is beautiful, but could've used a little bit of heat. Since the sun doesn't spend too much time on it during the day it is rather cold. The decor is tasteful and thoughtful, everything really compliments their style and the delightful ambiance. It's definitely relaxing. We chose to stay in a swim-up room and I am glad we did. We were in Room 108 - in the swim-up room closest to the bar and although I was worried about that, it wasn't a problem. In fact, I believe we had the largest patio! Although we didnt have French Doors leading to our balcony, we had a private patio area with our door to the outside, a table, two chairs and a couch built into the wall. It was fabulous! When we arrived the TV didnt work so they replaced it immediately. The AC was AWESOME - remote controlled with all kinds of settings. And the bathroom was well stocked. To be noted - the items in the mini-bar were fairly priced and the drinks at the hotel bar were fairly priced as well. 2 for 1 during happy hour makes them approx. $2-$2.50 US. Our complimentary breakfast each day was great. Especially since it's offered until noon. Thank you guys for that! Seriously thank you. The best part of breakfast is being allowed a hot and cold beverage along with your meal. **The juices are AMAZING** We stayed for seven nights and my husband still hadn't tried them all! The hotel is relaxed and quiet, the guests are friendly and I enjoyed that it was adults only immensely. However, Coco Bongo is literally next door - only a vacant lot separates the two properties so you softly hear the music until 4am. However, once you're inside your room with the AC on, it disappears. Since we are club goers this didn't bother us. Another benefit to this hotel is that it is located on 14th, and all of the clubs are on 12th. It is also on 10th, and all of the shops are on 5th. So you are one block from the avenue where everything happens and two blocks from all the clubs. Similarly, you are about a four block walk to the beach. Mamitas is kind of a walk and there are other places that are less crowded. I recommend Zenzi beach club. The chairs are cheap and La Tortuga guests receive a discount on chairs. It's about the same distance but it's less crowded! Definitely explore this hotel as an option.

The hotel strikes a nice balance between upscale and casual. The staff are well-trained and attentive without being overly doting. The architecture is open-air yet very intimate with numerous nooks and crannies to escape to. The pool area is beautiful, quiet, lushly landscaped and very well maintained. This is not a hotel for an action-packed day around the pool but rather for a quiet, contemplative respite from the hustle and bustle of Playa. We booked a junior suite with a (very) private rooftop jacuzzi and sun bed. Anna did an excellent job of coaching us through room choices via email and we were well-pleased with the result. As noted by others, our room was modestly-sized but very clean and well maintained. We rarely used the air conditioner as the overhead fan kept us cool enough. There were really only two minor things we would suggest as improvements. The bathrooms could use more shelf space and towel hooks, and the pillows were a little too thick for our preference. El Bistro restaurants (under the same ownership as La Tortuga) are truly among Playa's best. Breakfasts are excellent, plentiful and free (with our room anyway). You could easily eat something new every day for a week or two. Dinners are outstanding in both locations and reasonably priced. The wait staff are engaging and enthusiastic about their jobs. Our servers, Perla and Morgana, were both so personable and pleasant that we found ourselves returning as much for their company as for the excellent food. We have traveled to Playa several times over the past ten+ years. It has certainly changed over the years, but in many ways for the better. If you want a hotel that is beautiful, romantic, close to restaurants, shopping and the beach, yet quiet and out of the way, you will not do better than La Tortuga hotel. Other restaurants we experienced that are worth noting follow. Read carefully as they are very different from one another but we enjoy a wide range of experiences when we travel. Las Brisas: This authentic, open air Mexican restaurant will not be for everyone as it is definitely NOT elegant and upscale. But if you want the best guacamole and chips in town, give it a try. We also highly recommend the fried, whole grouper for an authentic Mexican experience. Yaxche: Extremely imaginitive Mayan food with the most unusual, elegant atmosphere in Playa. This experience is a feast for your eyes as well as your palate. Babes Noodles and Bar: Unpretentious to say the least, but serving excellent Thai and eclectic themed dishes at amazingly low prices.

Cancun is very nice but Playa is much more quaint than Cancun and the ferry connects to Cozumel.", "Date": "March 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Utah", "Title": "\u201cWe'll stay here every time we travel to Playa.\u201d", "Author": "traveler4114", "ReviewID": "UR58942666", "Content": "This hotel was recommended to us by a friend who travels to Playa often. We had a wonderful stay. The hotel is very quiet, private and beautiful. We upgraded from a basic room to a room with a balcony. We debated whether we should book a room that you can swim to from the pool but decided against it and are glad we did. We enjoyed being on the second floor overlooking the pool and the beautiful landscaping rather than at pool level, and we used our balcony to read and enjoy the sunshine. Breakfast at The Bistro is included in the price of the hotel. We loved restaurant, which includes outdoor seating in the hotel courtyard. Breakfast ranges from fresh Mexican fare to fresh fruits and toast. Fresh smoothies, juices, coffee and teas are also available. The service at the restaurant is excellent--try to sit in Daniel's section! We also ate dinner at the restaurant a couple of nights; we enjoyed dinner as much as the breakfasts. There is also a great bar in the courtyard with two-for-one drinks every night. The bartender was wonderful and definitely added to the lovely atmosphere of our stay. The pool and hot tub are beautiful, and the landscaping is spectacular. Our only complaint is that the pool was a bit cold despite the 80-90 degree weather. We would have spent much more time in the pool had it been a bit warmer. The hotel also includes a beach pass that provides free beach front seats. The beach is about a 2-3 minute walk from the hotel, and the major shopping and restaurant district is less than a block away. The rooms are spacious though I agree with a previous reviewer that the bedding was a bit course and we aired out our room every day when it felt a little humid and dank. The room service was outstanding, however. At night with the balcony doors closed and the fan and air conditioner on we could not hear a thing.

La Tortuga was a perfect choice. The grounds were well kept and beautiful. The hot tub surrounded by the pool was a nice touch. I loved the grounds because they were designed such that small groups or couples could find a little nook or cranny and it would be a perfectly private area. We were in a suite, with an AMAZING jacuzzi tub with a large swinging window that opened to an outdoor bed. We took a nap on it and loved it out there so much we contemplated sleeping out there. But the bed...oh my god, the bed was the softest thing I ever slept on. After soaking in the tub at night, we would lay on the best and be snoring in seconds. There was a tiny bit of bass coming from Coco Bongo (I think) but with the AC on I had to strain to hear it. The location is actually very good, a couple seconds from the nicest part of 5th Ave and 2 blocks from the beach. I wouldn't want to stay on 5th Ave or the beach in Playa del Carmen since it seems like it would be VERY noisy. The access to the beach club was perfect, 5 minute walk at most without the hassle of staying right on the beach. Benny and Ivan at the front desk were great, they helped us get our deep sea fishing trip booked. The only criticism I had (and its probably unique to me) was the there was a touch of \"overservice\" One bartender tried hard to get us into a restaraunt downtown and to give them his card. When we got back at night, we got a couple phone calls which were probably the front desk asking how our stay was but we didn't pick up because we were afraid it was someone trying to sell us on El Bistro. We didn't eat any of the food there since we spent most of our time out, but I just don't like overly attentive service to the point of selling. Otherwise it was an amazing stay and I'm very happy we chose La Tortuga.", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Rapids, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cComfort and friendliness in the city for good value\u201d", "Author": "peggiesfarm", "ReviewID": "UR58757417", "Content": "After making ourselves crazy by reading all the reviews for multiple AIs, we decided to stay in town at a smaller hotel for our first trip to Playa del Carmen. And we were very happy with our decision overall. We used frequent flier miles to get down there and made our reservations online using the hotel website and email. We also arranged for airport transfer using the hotel website form. Payment was through PayPal and very easy. We were sent confirmation and instructions from the hotel. We arrived at the Cancun airport on a Wednesday morning with transport arranged by the hotel for two people. After we made it past (barely) all the blue-shirted salespeople after customs, he was waiting for us outside in a yellow shirt with his name on it just as described in our instructions from the hotel. We rode in a passenger van which was in good condition and our driver offered to stop at a convenience store at the start of the trip in case we wanted to buy drinks or snacks. As we got into Playa, the outskirts of town looked fairly gritty, but the hotel is one block from 5th Ave and the tourist district. Check-in was right at the front entrance and quick with our room being ready immediately, which was lucky since we were pretty tired. We stayed in room 207 (standard plus) with a view if the pool and a small, but nice balcony. The room itself was fairly small but we got used to it and learned to make do by opening the door and windows to make it feel bigger. Air conditioning is not necessary on any but the most humid days... it was 80 degrees most days we were there. Room and bath were very clean and simply appointed but comfortable. Staff is exceeding friendly with pleasant little restaurant and bar. Restaurant is open to the public street which was nice and gave you a sense of not being so closed in. Breakfast is included with voucher from the front desk each morning with several fresh choices and generous portions. We had dinner at El Bistro on just the first night -- pasta with large shrimp and cream sauce and shrimp fajitas, both were very nice. Pool, solarium and bar area at La Tortuga are all very comfortable, pretty and tidy. Pool is not really designed for swimming exercise but is great for cooling off and is fairly large. It was not very crowded while we were there and so we stayed by the pool on several days without even going to the beach. Vouchers are available for both the Mamitas and Zenzi beach clubs. If you get to Mamitas before 10AM you have an OK chance of getting the free beach cots and umbrella. Instructions are not clear on where to go and what to do once you get there, but in general the rules seem to be just grab the first loungers and umbrella you see. The guy managing the chairs will come by and ask for your voucher and then give you a wrist tag which allows access to the bathrooms and shower. If the umbrellas are all taken, you can wait from someone to bring you a lounger and place it near the area you want to lay. There are also big beds available just next to this main area and closer to the hipster lounge/music area. Beds are an extra fee with a minimum purchase of a bottle of liquor for US$100. We ended up with an umbrella near the music and although the music in the morning as great (Brazilian jazz, etc.) it got a little too loud and eventually left. Zenzi is much closer to the hotel and a lot smaller but you pay about 50 pesos for each chair and another 50 pesos for an umbrella. The rule here also seems to be to grab the first open lounger you see, but the guys managing the drinks and chairs are roaming around more frequently than at Mamitas. Supposedly you get your fee back through your drinks order and a 20% discount on drinks with the voucher. Not sure I saw evidence of this, but maybe we drank more than I thought. They had a barbecue lunch on Sunday if you wanted and seemed to be burgers and such for a another fee. My boyfriend liked Zenzi better than Mamitas as he thought it was more laid back, comfortable, smaller, less crowded -- certainly the music was not as loud and they had a live band on Sunday which was fun, playing lots of US covers. Overall La Tortuga was a very pleasant and nice stay with the friendly staff being one of the best aspects. The only things which could have been better would be minor: 1) would be nice if less staff was visible all day working on the pool area and with cleaning carts in our hallway 2) more capacity for bar service at happy hour since it gets busy and 3) room was a tad small small. We did look in on a smaller hotel right on the beach and decided we La Tortuga was much nicer. We would recommend La Tortuga to anyone looking to avoid the AI experience and to get a chance to see the town and sample some local food at the smaller restaurants off the strip.", "Date": "March 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowa", "Title": "\u201cNice Location\u201d", "Author": "djfiowa", "ReviewID": "UR58726847", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at the La Tortuga.

As already previously mentioned, we cannot praise the staff enough: everyone was always helpful, kind and made you really feel welcome. Special praise as well for the breakfast: a lot of typical Mexican breakfast dishes, and this is what you want to a place like this, for buffet continental breakfast, we can as well stay at home. We had dinner as well in the Bistro, very good food and prices which are not higher than anywhere else. Minibar was cheap as well. The happy hour at the bar was a good occassion to meet some other people in the hotel as well. Only little downside of the hotel: depending where your room may be located, it can get a bit noisy at night, but on the other hand, this is a hotel in the heart of Playa, so this was expected.

We were quite pleased with the level of service at your hotel, the attention to detail and the personalized attention. We had a minor problem with our air conditioner which was handled immediately. We were glad to run it because you could hear a little Coco Bongo base from down the street. But I'm a light sleeper. The bathrooms could definitely use some storage space. Perhaps some shelves for personal items, but who spends time in the room anyhow? We felt our swim-up room wasn't the best value because of the unseasonable cool weather Mexico was having at the time. I would say I could use a little less trees near the pool, and perhaps more sunny areas to bask in. We caught a grouper going deep sea fishing and your chef prepared it for us at lunch. We were expecting just grilled fish, but he went above and beyond, putting rice and vegetables with it. Very impressive. Daniel was so sweet to be around at El Bistro, I wanted to take him home. The food at El Bistro never disappointed either. We really enjoyed the atmosphere the hotel provided and the breakfast was great. I'm not sure what the other reviewer was talking about when he said breakfast wasn't free, because it definitely was. You just needed a voucher from the front desk and you had to select certain entrees. So, not sure what the trouble was there?

I forgot to request a flower for my hair on the wedding day and within a half-an-hour of leaving to be married at the beach someone from the front desk sent a young man to get that for me just before I left.

It was our first visit to Mexico and we are so pleased we found La Tortuga - thanks to Trip Advisor. From the time we walked into Reception for the first time to be warmly welcomed by lovely smiley Lisa we realised all the positive reviews we had read about La Tortuga were to be believed. She gave us lots of info about the hotel and a fresh fruit drink which went down a treat after out very long journey. All the staff were so friendly, always had a smile and a\" hola\" and were helpful. The hotel was well run, maintained to a high standard and the pool area was beautiful and lush. It was hard to imagine that just outside was the buzz of 5th Avenue. The hotel couldn't be located in a more convenient position, the shops, bars and restaurants right outside the door and the beach just a stroll away. We spent our beach days on the sun beds at Marmitas beach club which La Tortuga had an arrangement with (along with another venue nearby) whereby we collected \"a beach pass\" each day from Reception which enabled us to use the beds free of charge. La Bistro served a varied menu for the complimentary breakfast and, unfortunately as we were only there for 7 nights, we didn't manage to sample every item but what we did order was always 5 star and the fruit drinks were delicious. We visited their other La Bistro on 5th for breakfast one morning and, naturally, the staff there were just as pleasant. The evening menu was top class; we ate there a couple of times and enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. Happy Hour was just that thanks to the lovely Marco and Fidel. A very relaxed atmosphere and the free internet access was handy to have if we needed it. It was so pleasant sitting by the pool sipping campari and soda not having a care in the world - for 7 days at least. We stayed in a standard plus room which was spotless; we were most impressed by the powerful shower. Our room had a balcony overlooking the pool which looked lovely when illuminated at night. We looked forward to returning to our room at the end of the afternoon to see what \"towel sculpture\" our maid had left for us on the bed. This was one of the extra touches that made the hotel so special to us.

The hotel's location is perfect, basically within walking distance to everything we wanted - the beach, restaurants, shops, etc. We were a little concerned about not staying right on the beach, but the 5min walk to the beach was quite pleasant and the hotel has arrangements with several beach clubs that allow you to use their chairs and umbrellas which worked out really great. The staff at the hotel were awesome. From the moment we got there we felt at home. The room is a little on the small side, at least compared to the resorts we are used to, but it was clean and comfortable, and we really didn't spend much time in the room anyway. When we were relaxing at the room we were usually on the terrace or up on the private rooftop, which was very spacious and a nice treat. I definitely recommend booking a room with a private rooftop jacuzzi and relaxing under the stars at 1am !! Also a nice touch was the happy birthday balloons, champagne and birthday cake that was waiting for us in our room when we arrived!

The hotel is really pretty and is just one block away from the popular 5a Avenida (5th Avenue) in Playa del Carmen. I chose this hotel because it was No Kids and it was NOT all inclusive. This meant we got a really quiet hotel and could go out to dinner every night to the myriad of restaurants Playa has to offer. First things first: this hotel is NOT on the beach. I knew this going in, but when all was said and done, I kind of regretted not getting a beach-side hotel. You get a free The beach club pass every day (and freee towels). but the beaches were so full for X-Mas and New years that you had to get to the beach club at 8:30am to get a decent place near the water. And they place was crawling with kids, so my investment to avoid their noise and general ruckus did not really pay off since we spent a lot of time on the beach. Still, none of this was the hotel's fault, the location advertised is Excellent, one block away from all the commotion of the main street. The hotel is right next to the CocoBongo night club. I read from some people here that the noise from the club was too much, but I actually stood OUTSIDE the club at 2am and could barely hear anything from the street. I really doubt you could hear anything from inside the rooms in the hotel, but I guess it depends how sensitive you are to noise and vibrations and stuff. Still, this was no problem for us at all. The room included breakfast each day from 7am to 12 noon, which is great because you can get up relatively late and still get a free breakfast. The restaurant at the hotel, Le Bistro, served really high quality food. We got to sample the entire breakfast menu the week we were there and loved everything (especially the Machaca!). They give you a 25% off dinner coupon and we used it up and the dinner was also excellent. The hotel staff was always extremely friendly and welcoming, always happy to give you more towels and breakfast passes. They weren't always too knowledgeable about the touristy stuff (like a concierge would be at a larger hotel) but they had lots of brochures and everything was always a short walk away, so you could just go and ask. For example they didn't have any details about skydiving or cheap ways to get to Tulum (not by tour bus), but the answers were either in their brochures or just a 10min walk to the skydiving office (skydiving was AMAZING, btw). We got the standard room, not the jr suite, but it was very large and had remote-control powered A/C. The bathroom was HUGE and beautiful. We didn't get a window or balcony, so that kind of sucked, but we only missed it to dry our swimsuits after a day at the beach. The pool area was beautiful, we got to sit in the central jacuzzi at night and it felt very private. We even got drinks served to us there (oh, and the bar had a 2x1 happy hour from 5pm to 7pm every night! Great margaritas!). I really liked this hotel, and even though next time if I go in such a high season date, I will chose a beach-front hotel, this place is still wonderful in any other time and is a really great value.

Everything with the hotel was wonderful, from the front desk staff to the pool area to the service at the restaurant. The only problem was when I went to fill our Jacuzzi at about 11:30 pm. After about 45 minutes, the Jaccuzi was finally full enough to use, so my wife and I got in and tried to turn the jacuzzi on. It made a humming noise for about 10 seconds and then quit. We waited and tried with a few more times; each time with the same response: the jacuzzi simply didn't work. Even this didn't leave us overly bothered, as we figured the hotel would do something to make this right -- given we'd paid an extra $100 for a Jacuzzi Suite. We went to check out the following morning and informed the front desk of the Jacuzzi problems. Their response was that we should have contacted them the previous night and they would have moved us. They were seriously suggesting that we should have moved rooms between midnight and 1 a.m. When we told them that wasn't reasonable at such an hour, they responded that they could have sent maintenance to the room. Again, we had no desired for someone to come and repair the jacuzzi in the early hours of the morning; that is something that should been done during the day when no one is in the room. It was clear they had no interest in making the situation right, so we chose to continue on our trip to Cozumel and enjoyed the rest of the weekend.

We chose La Tortuga after much research and were thrilled with our choice. Set only a block back from 4th Ave where all the restaurants, bars and shops are, and 2 blocks or so from the beautiful beach, the location couldn't have been better for us as it was nice and quiet at night. The grounds and hotel common areas were immaculate and the gardens were well tended and beautifully leafy offering plenty of shade, especially around the pool. Our room (205) was light and airy with whitewashed walls, terracotta tiled floor and two queen beds. Double doors led out to a sunny balcony with table and chairs and overlooked the pool, restaurant and bar. The bathroom was modern and there was plenty of storage. Alas, due to some of the rooms being updated, we were affected by noise during the day. Our concerns were met immediately and we were offered a choice of rooms to move to which was nice. We were fortunate to be upgraded to one of the hotel's best rooms at no extra cost which made us very happy. This superior suite was fully refurbished throughout with king sized bed , a flat screen tv, private jacuzzi set into a bay window, decent wardrobes with ironing board and iron, and a bar fridge and drinks trolley. The powder room had marble twin sink vanities set into a huge wooden beam for a counter top, hairdryer, and a separate room housed the spacious shower and wc. Outside on the deck was a king sized outdoor four poster bed for lazing around on. Bliss ! The pool was large and irregularly shaped and wound its way around the whole hotel. An indoor/outdoor lounge area with lovely soft lamps, couches and coffee tables was the perfect place for pre dinner drinks and the adjoining restaurant served tasty and well priced food. We ate there 6 out of 9 nights. Marmita's Beach Club is a leisurely 15 minute walk from the hotel where you can use the beach lounges and umbrellas all day, or you can take a 15 minute cab ride to another swanky private beach club and rest on queen sized matresses on the sand - ahhh!!!!

If you do decide to stay in Playa, stay at La Tortuga. 3. Splurge for the Junior Suite...any room with the rooftop jacuzzi. Let me tell you, enjoying a bubble bath under the stars with tequila (or bev of choice) and a Cuban -er, Mexican, cigar is PURE HEAVEN. That, my friends, is what vacation is all about. It's close to everything as it's situated right in the center of town but feels extremely private and relaxing. The pool is incredible, the lounge areas are beautiful and well maintained, and the service is fabulous. Every person on staff is a gem, particularly the gentleman at the front desk, whose name escapes me at the moment. The bar is small but well stocked, and the bartender is fantastic. The food at the restaurant is very good. Their wines are great! Lots of European and South American imports. Be sure to visit the sister restaurant away from the hotel. They usually give you a promotional discount if you eat there, and that applies to alcohol/beverages, too! Like 30% off or something. The food at that restaurant is excellent. The beaches in Playa are so crowded. Not my thing. Ask the staff where to go to enjoy a more relaxing setting and you won't regret it.

I would certainly stay here again and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone. Location was ideal. Close to everything but away from the noise. The grounds were picturesque: an inner court with a meandering pool, beautifully landscaped gardens and restaurant seating for breakfast until noon! I was not disappointed in any way. Even one night when a party of young adults was celebrating a bit too loudly, within less than 1 minute they were quiet. This was the only time there was any undue noise. The gardens, pool and rooms were all kept clean and invitingly decorated.

We did not want an all-inclusive experience, due to a bad experience last year in Antigua, and our desire for a more 'free-form' vacation. From the moment we arrived, we were treated to the first of many special treats for the week. Our bed was made up with two towel swans in the shape of a heart, along with a room full of rose petals. The room was a little cozy, but more than comfortable for 2 people and a week's worth of luggage. The balcony (which we used frequently) overlooked the pool, which as a 'lazy river' type of arrangement, was a welcome departure to the typical pool shape. The palm trees surrounding the pool provided a welcome respite from the very strong sun. There was even a banana tree with young fruit on it. The staff were nothing short of professional, friendly, and welcoming. The place is small enough that the staff quickly learns and remembers your name. You are not just a room number here. Requests are responded to quickly and courteously, such as bagged ice for both of our sunburns (mine on the second day, hers on the next-to-last)! The two bartenders make a mean drink, and the 2-for-1 happy hour every day leads to a lot of experimenting with the cocktail menu. There is a desktop computer available on the bar to check your email or Facebook. The hotel had wifi and we never had any problem accessing the network on our personal laptop. While we had a week's worth of incredible meals throughout the town, one would be amiss to overlook El Bistro, right at the hotel. We ate breakfast there every day, along with 2 dinners. The food is flavorful, robust, and loyal to local cuisine. Again, the servers knew us by name, and seemed to go out of their way to make sure everything was right with the meals. They remembered the little details which made our meals that much more enjoyable. Itza Spa had a wide range of services available at the best prices I have ever seen. They were responsive and able to make suggestions for services based on my interests and concerns without being pushy. Their masseur was phenomenal and I had two massages with him over the course of the week. We booked 2 excursions through the front desk, and Lisa was able to secure space on one of them late the evening before. She was also able to reschedule an excursion at the last minute due to my sunburn. All in all, when we return to Playa, we will not hesitate to stay at La Tortuga again.

The hotel's beach club (Mamitas), which is 8 blocks from the hotel, offers excellent service and the amenities are in great condition. The restaurant (Bistro) served traditional mexican breakfast. Best of all, it was included in the rate. The pool at the hotel was a great place to hang out apres the beach. There is a jacuzzi and an exercise swim area.

The pool is a great place to cool off after a day at the beach. Happy hour is a nice way to meet fellow travelers or to just chill out with a book in a quiet corner or check up on friends and family back home from the free internet right there at the bar (Fidel makes the BEST mojitos in Playa). As a solo female traveler, security is of course a consideration and I cannot recommend La Tortuga highly enough for making one feel comfortable and well taken care of. Every single member of the staff is wonderful, from the front desk to the office to the restaurant. Speaking of which, El Bistro is a great place to eat, and the fact that a full breakfast is included with your stay is a real bonus. The hotel will provide you with towels and passes or coupons for either Mamitas or Zenzi beach clubs - try them both! Also during this trip, the hotel staff recommended the Bluecacao beach club as an out-of-town (about 10 mins by cab) alternative, and that club was beautiful and very nice - gorgeous setting, inifinity pool, amazing food and impeccable service.

This was our first trip to Mexico and although a serious topic, the local and global media, as per usual, like to create devastation wherever possible and the impact has been felt in Playa, an area where there has not been a single case! Onto the hotel itself. In a nutshell, I agree with the other travellers. A1 service, awesome room (we had 312 with rooftop jacuzzi, stunning), amazing oasis in the middle of a built-up area, great food at the adjacent Le Bistro, lovely quality breakfast, good cocktails and above all, we did not see or hear a child all week (11th-18th July) which was bliss. Also my partner and I were staying due to our 2nd anniversary and the team kindly laid on flowers on the bed (see photo) and a free bottle of local champagne. We did not venture out much during day due to crippling humidity (for me personally that is) but with two books, great drinks and food and fantastic staff, I was pleased, unusually for me, to spend a whole week just chilling out. In particular I must mention Marco who was exceptional. The only minor downsides are that the noise from the clubs can be VERY loud, however if you can sleep with the doors shut and with air con/fan on, sleep is OK. My only other comment would be beware the biting ants, or whatever they were. I have never seen so many people with bites and despite using anti-insect spray, we picked up 3-4 fresh bits every day. The locals also have this issue, but just a friendly comment, be prepared and purchase some repellent. The absolute beauty, effort in styling and quality of service makes this a 5 star all the way for me, but I must mark down the noisy clubs, giving it a very healthy and well deserved 4 out of 5 stars.

Everything good I read on the web was true - this place is the best! Don't second guess, and wonder \"IF\"... This is a true hidden gem. Booking a place that you read about can often be a bit un-nerving \u2013 especially for my husband, whom had never been to Mexico except on a cruise. I, on the other hand, have traveled a lot. EVERYTHING about this place is amazing!!! From my first email to Anna I knew this was the right spot for a romantic getaway with my hubby. Responses were immediate and very helpful. Anna and Lisa always got back to me within a day. We booked the Standard Plus and at the last minute I upgraded to the Superior Junior Suite as a surprise for my husband (first time away from the kids in 7 years). When we got there we were greeted by Berny and 2 great drinks. Then taken on a tour of the hotel - The grounds and pool are amazingly kept - and then to our room. It had flower petals and a towel swan on the bed and a bottle of champagne waiting for us. The room was amazing. We were in Room 101. Had our own private pool, a huge Jacuzzi tub and a cool shower head right in the middle of the tub. We never used the tub, as our own private pool was so inviting everyday. I would recommend this to anyone! Breakfast is everyday starting at 7am and goes till 11 (maybe noon??). You get a FULL great breakfast, served at your table. It was enough to keep us going thru the day, only needing a few snacks, until dinner. The wait staff always saw you coming and escorted you to your seat. They got to know you by name. \uf04a The Eggs Benedict and the Egg Enchiladas are wonderful. Ask for extra pico to go with. Happy hour is from 5-7 with 2 for 1 drinks and they make a mean Cancun Margarita. The bar tenders also like to experiment, as well. Great place to meet others and learn what they had done that day, get suggestions of activities, etc. Also a great way to learn that every room in this boutique hotel is different. I had read at times that the pool could be cool \u2013 NEVER was. It was great! (the swim up rooms looked amazing as well\u2026) The location is wonderful \u2013 just one block off of 5th Avenue where all of the shops/vendors/restaurants are located. We would walk 5th Ave, buy stuff, bring it back to the hotel, and head out again. It was great to have it so close to everything, yet feel like you were in your own private, quiet world. The beach was only 3 blocks away. Lisa and Berny were great in helping us know what to do and where to go. When we got back from a trip they always welcomed you and asked how your day was. it's great to be a person and not just a number, like in the large all-inclusive places. They made all of the arrangements for whatever we wanted to do/go/ and see. We got a great tip \u2013 if you want to spend a lot of time in the water snorkeling then go to Xel-Ha and do NOT combine with the Tulum trip. If we did combine the two trips, we would have had about 3 hours less at Xel-Ha. We just took a cab on our own to Tulum one day and this gave us plenty of time to do our own thing. Lisa gave us great ideas for places to eat. There is a great chocolate shop at the round-about (the brownies are to die for\u2026 be sure to bring one back for Lisa). Another great place to eat is Fusion. Tikki torches on the beach, jazz in the background, and a fire dance show at 10pm. The fish tacos and caesar salad are great. There are no words that can truly express what a wonderful place this is. Pictures do not do it justice \u2013 you cannot capture the pure warmth, emotion, and friendship, along with every detail of the facilities and the rooms.

It's beautifully maintained and well located with a friendly, welcoming staff. The courtyard, pool, bar, and restaurant are attractive and comfortable. Landscaping and architecture are attractive. Staff were helpful with other travel arrangements like shuttle from Cancun, tours, and diving. PRO: Very friendly staff, especially in the bistro and at the bar. Great happy hour, with fine capirinias, margaritas, and mojitos made right, to order. Good breakfasts included. Scrupulously clean and well maintained. Comfortable bed and luxurious towels. Good lighting, decent number of outlets. AC works great (if noisy). Good location just off the heart of 5th Avenue. Good recommendations on tour guide (Pepe Lopez of Mayan Expeditions), scuba (Pluto Dive, Alberto), and flawless pick-up from Cancun. Good free wireless connection accessible in most of hotel; free internet access (1 PC) in bar. CONS: Rooms (we were in a standard plus) are a bit small: no seating area except in the unsecured balcony, no drawers and little closet space, no shelfs in bathroom, not enough drying hooks. Got bad directions from the front desk staff twice (to dive shop, to book store).

I had no desire to travel to Mexico due to all of the recent bad press concerns about the flu, etc. We vacation every year to a different island in the Caribbean, usually at All-Inclusives, so when we arrived I was a little hesitant as to what to expect. This is a small boutique hotel in the heart of Playa del Carmen and I must say that this little oasis of a hotel is a true gem. Our room was a Superior Junior Suite and it was excellent. The only thing that I missed and thought that the room could have used was a dresser for clothes storage. This could have easily fit under the flat screen TV that was mounted on the wall across from the bed. I didn't like stacking our clothes on shelves in the closet. Although the closet was roomy, it would have been nice to have a chest of drawers for additional storage. The air conditioning worked great and the cleanliness of the room was A+. The king bed was excellent...very comfortable. Our housekeeper with her decorative art (towel animals) was excellent. The hotel staff could not do enough for you and always with a smile. The food at El Bistro was terrific. We ate at restaurants outside of the hotel at least nine times and the hotel was better or equal to anywhere we ate. The prices are good as well. The pool was a great retreat after spending the day at Mamitas or Zenzi. It was always nice to go back to the pool and relax. Mamitas has the better beach but Zenzi has the better food. But, both were very nice. If you need any food or supplies while staying in Playa, Walmart was a three block walk from the hotel and had everything you could possibly want, including a great bakery! One of our favorite aspects of this hotel is being just one block from Fifth Avenue and all of the restaurants, bars, shops, etc. Everything that Playa del Carmen has to offer is within walking distance. The Fat Cat Catamaran day sail is an excursion that we highly recommend. It was a four hour cruise of snorkling, lunch, swimming and beverages. The crew was fantastic. The boat leaves from Puerto Adventures where they also have swimming with the dolphins. This is a very clean, safe, beautiful and well run tourist operation. Our final comment on the hotel is the concern about the night club Coco Bongo. If Coco Bongo would simply turn down the volume and the banging of the bass, most people would probably never know that they were nearby, especially with the AC on. It didn't stop us from having a wonderful vacation, that's for sure!

I can not say enough about how much we loved the hotel, our room and the staff. We had stayed at La Tortuga many times in the past, and though we have always enjoyed it, it exceeded even our own high expectations. Because we love Playa del Carmen so much, we tend to go for long stretches at a time (a month or more), making it more practical to stay in an apartment instead of a hotel. This time we made a huge mistake in our choice of apartments and found ourselves in a bit of a dump. A few weeks in, we really needed to splash out for the night and checked into room 116 at Hotel La Tortuga. It was amazing!!!! It is almost a free standing bungalow, there is another one right next door, it is not in the main building. We had our own little deck with a hammock looking out into the pool garden. The room was clean, simple, elegant (I LOVE that bathroom with the sinks sitting on top of a beautiful piece of wood) and the tub/shower was large and lovely. But the best part, the best part by faaaar, was the jacuzzi tub upstairs on our own private roof terrace! We took a bubble bath under the stars! It was amazing! And the bed was so comfortable, I refused to go to the gym in the morning, I wanted to stay there until the last minute! I should say, about the bed, some people prefer a really firm mattress, I am not one of those people. This bed was so soft I just sunk right in and never wanted to leave. There was a really lovely flat screen TV in the room, but to be honest, we never turned it on. We stayed in the bubble bath/jacuzzi on the roof most of the night. We spent the day by the pool which is situated in a really lush garden. It is its own little oasis in there. The architecture of the entire hotel seems to be created in an organic way around large trees that have probably grown there for decades. It is a wonderland in there. A grown up wonderland. The pool is serpentine and there are little bridges and various seating/lounging areas. There is a jacuzzi on a small wooden deck/island in the middle of the pool, but to get to it, you only have to wade across the shallowest portion of the pool, ankle deep or so. Or you can come around from the back side and cross over a bridge. And at night the entire garden is lit up with twinkling lights hung in trees and torches near the pool. Yes, at dusk, there are mosquitos. But you can't have a lush, tropical pool garden in paradise without them. And Fidel, the bartender, had some repellant on hand to scare them away. We ate lunch and had drinks poolside, but decided to go to the restaurant for dinner. The menu changes from lunch to dinner, but we both loved our meals there. In fact, we went back for lunch another couple of times before we left Playa because the pechuga de pollo a la plancha (grilled chicken) was so delicious and, frankly, an amazing bargain! Oh, and the guacamole was delicious, too!!!! They also had a nice selection of salads (I had the scallop salad which was really good!). Anyway, we really loved it. Everyone was kind and attentive, the room was gorgeous, the ambiance is not to be beat and the restaurant was really good. If we could afford to stay there every night for a month, we would have done it in a heartbeat. We would, and certainly will go back to La Tortuga. In the 4 years since we first stayed there, the hotel has expanded and improved and still never lost its unique charm and character.", "Date": "May 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "WASHINGTON, DC", "Title": "\u201cMy Daughter got married in Playa del Carmen\u201d", "Author": "Chulee", "ReviewID": "UR30397578", "Content": "Just a wonderful experience, we hired expert wedding planners and everything was perfect.

When we arrived in our room, #21, I noticed how small it was, the \"Queen\" bed was more like a \"Full\" and that there was a strange smell in the room, but I thought maybe it just needed to be aired out. Took a shower and the curtain just would not hold the water in the shower, bathroom a mess, and that is when I saw the first rather large Roach. I killed it and didn't tell my wife, she hates bugs. When we got back to the room that night, the sewage smell was still there and then I heard a scream as my wife moved her bag and the Roaches went running. I went down to the front desk, but the Security Guard on duty said there was nothing he could do, but to take up my complaint in the morning. After I killed a few more Roaches I had enough and caught 2 under one glass and 1 under another, then I made the Security Guard look in the room and THEN he agreed to move us. The new room still had a bad shower curtain that always seemed to come loose. Now these rooms I am talking about were \"Standard\" I was told the only difference from a \"Standard\" and a \"Standard Plus\" was a view of the pool, could not be more wrong, the \"Standards\" didn't seem to received the new upgrades that the other rooms had. The next night we got back late again (hey we were on vacation) and went to set the alarm, that didn't work. Now I called the front desk but was told it was too late to place a wake-up call... and I could not make the person at the front desk understand that I could not call at 6:00 am for a 7:00 am wake-up call AHHHH. Now the staff was nice, but I had lunch at the hotel one day and the waiter said it was 200 pesos, I said I wanted it charged to the room and when the bill came for me to sign it was for only 160 pesos... still a bargain, but I don't like being conned. The last night we were there I killed yet another Roach, didn't tell my wife until we checked out. Then a friend pointed out that we probably had the Roach problem because the rooms were right above the restaurant. The same place we had been to... I felt sick. To sum up - Roaches in room 21 & 22, small, showers curtains were horrible, bring your own alarm clock. Do not book a \"Standard\" Best bet stay somewhere else!

We returned for a 4 night stay last week (end of March). We absolutely love this hotel! The grounds are beautiful with lush, tropical vegetation, and the staff is incredibly friendly. They make you feel right at home and are so attentive. Reserving the room was very quick and easy. Last time, we stayed on the third floor in a standard-plus room with a balcony and view of the pool. This time we stayed in a standard room on the second floor with a smaller balcony looking out over the pool. The standard and standard-plus rooms are small but very clean. There wasn't a huge difference between the standard vs. standard-plus rooms, but I don't think many of the standard rooms have balconies, and we really enjoyed having one. The breakfast at the hotel is phenomenal, particularly because it's included with the price of the room! We loved the fresh juices (I recommend the papaya juice) and the \"Mayan\" omelette - eggs, peppers, mushrooms, spinach with a side of black beans and yuca (or maybe potatoes?). You're allowed to choose one juice, one hot beverage, and one main dish. The portions are generous, and they also give you plentiful bread and jam/butter, so you can really fill up. We've had both lunch and dinner at the hotel restaurant (El Bistro) and enjoyed our meals there. The hotel gives you a 25% discount on dinner one night at the restaurant. There are a lot of good deals around town for happy hour, but we preferred to relax by the bar area/pool at La Tortuga during happy hour (5-6pm) and enjoyed their 2 for 1 drinks. Although the pool area at La Tortuga is very nice, we took advantage of the free beach club passes every day. We really like Mamitas Beach Club, which is about a 10 minute walk away. Most of the walk is on Quinta Avenida (5th Ave) and goes by very quickly. Mamitas is a beautiful beach with very fine white sand that never seems to get hot. Some days the water was calmer than others, but it was always a pretty turquoise color and warm. During our trip the air temperature was usually in the mid 80s during the day (low 70s at night), but there was a constant breeze that kept you cool. If you want a palapa to get some shade, I'd recommend getting there early (i.e. before 10am), however, palapas open up throughout the day. One day we went to a newer beach club called Blucacao (again getting free passes from La Tortuga). It was a 5-10 minute cab ride away (~$8-10 each way), but we thought it was well-worth the trip for a day of relaxing in a small and secluded beach club by shallow pools that look out over the beach. The beach is much smaller than Mamitas and less attractive on either side of Blucacao, but the stretch right in front of the pool area is very nice.

At first, you wonder as it is small and just an average place, especially if you are used to the 4/5 Star resorts and such, but then you start to see the attentiveness of the staff, appreciate how clean your room is and how comfortable the beds are and the sereneness of floating around the pretty pool without anyone bothering you or making noise. This hotel is comfortable for a single person alone or even a family. I will never stay at an all inclusive resort again. We felt safe our entire trip. The breakfasts are good, but in general El Bistro was just average, but my guess it will become even better as they are very attentive to feedback. Yes, internet is slow, but it was nice having a computer to use. And the Mamitas Beach Club is just a short walk away. We enjoyed the tiny talk there - no big deal at all and there were plenty of chairs for everyone.

It is clearly worth the effort. 5 star service and food with miles of a nearly private beach and beautiful calm clear water. Way better than the Mamitas experience.

We had room 101 which came with a private pool. We really enjoyed our stay due to the service of the staff and the general quaintess of the hotel. Most of the other reviews seem to hold fairly true as far the pros and cons of this hotel. Lucky for us, we stayed during the off nights of Coco Bongo so we did not have an issue with club noise. However, we were on the other side of the hotel so we would probably not have heard it anyways. As far as road noise, yes you will hear some, but the rooms are not very far from the road, unlike resort hotels, so its not that unexpected. I did not have an issue with it, maybe thats because Ive lived in much louder places and just blocked it out. Room Size: The rooms are fairly small. However, we found ourselves in the room rarely other than for sleeping and one day of vegging around the room/pool. Ideally, it would be nice to have a larger room, but at the same time, this is a boutique type hotel, not a motel chain or resort. Staff: Very helpful and polite. One of the selling points of this place. El Bistro: Nice place to relax and grab a quick breakfast. Food is not \"wow\" but it is not expensive and I did not have any issues with it. Location: Its one block off of Avenida 5. So in my opinion you lose some noise from people traffic but gain road traffic, no biggy. As far as the construction, I do not see how you can fault the hotel. Maintenance has to get done and some of the other work is out of their control. Cost: Its a toss up. I really enjoyed my stay there, so I did not have a problem with it.

I picked this hotel based on other Trip Advisor reviews and I was not disappointed. I had originally booked our vacation at a large all-inclusive, but decided that a small, boutique hotel was more our style and changed the reservation. Best decision I could have made! La Tortuga is small, with great service, a friendly staff, and a wonderful ambiance. We really enjoyed the daily happy hour from 5-6 pm (2 for 1 drinks) - many hotel guests come down to the bar to chat, relax, sit by the pool, and share stories. We found the other hotel guests to be very pleasant, down-to-earth, and friendly. Most of the other guests were young (20's) or middle-aged (30's-50's) couples, although I did see 1 family of 3 (with an older daughter) and a pair of best friends in their 20's. It's definitely not a crazy \"party\" crowd, just really cool people. It looks exactly like the photos on the website. We stayed in a swim-up room, which was great, although we didn't use the pool much. It was VERY cold, but we did take advantage of the hot tub one evening. Another great thing about this hotel is the complimentary breakfast. It's so great to wake up, throw on some clothes, and leisurely walk down to a delicious breakfast by the pool. The staff is friendly and the food is very good. You get 1 free juice, 1 coffee, and 1 entree per person (you have your choice of about 15 entrees ranging from fruit & yogurt to pancakes to eggs benedict to omelets). The location is outstanding. When I first booked the hotel, I was concerned that it wasn't directly on the beach. But after arriving, I didn't care at all! The indoor courtyard is beautiful, and the Mamitas Beach Club is a short 10-minute walk. Plus, the neighbors in the room next to us told us that the public beach in Playa isn't very nice because fisherman use it to bring in their catch, so using the private beach clubs is the way to go anyway. The hotel is 1 block from 5th Avenue - every night we wandered down 5th, looking for a place to eat dinner. I could have stayed in Playa for 3 months, eaten at a different restaurant for every meal, and still not have visited all of them. It's great! To address the music issues expressed by a few others - yes, there is a loud, obnoxious club about 2 blocks away called Coco Bongo. And yes, you can hear the bass at night, but it was faint and wasn't enough to keep us up, or detract from our experience. La Tortuga's location is part of the package - if you want to be close to everything (i.e. 5th Ave), then you get some noise along with it. But it was good noise...the sounds of people out walking around, having fun, enjoying themselves. We didn't find it to be annoying in the least. If I had to complain about something, it would be the shower. It leaks. Big deal. The pool is too cold. So what? One last thing - the hotel restaurant, El Bistro, is excellent. It was the best meal we had on our entire vacation (I'll be writing a separate review for this). If you're looking for an ultra-luxury hotel with all the amenities and room service ona silver platter, this isn't your place. But if you're a chill, low-maitenance person who appreciates good service and a relaxing enviornment, you'll love it.

However, our overall impression was that we did not receive great value for what we paid, and more importantly did not have an overly relaxing stay while at the hotel due to the noise factor. We stayed in a Standard Plus room on the 10th Ave side which faced onto a busy thoroughfare with non stop traffic noise- too noisy to sit on balcony or open door for fresh air. For two days there was hours of power washing noise from the street, and the last couple of days, the smell of chemicals as plant pots were being painted in the hotel. I had specifically indicated prior to booking that we wanted a quiet place to stay so this was particularly disappointing and would have booked elsewhere if I'd know about the noise. Alot of the noise seems to be out of the hotels control, however disclosure that we would be staying next to a major street would have been appreciated. The front desk was able to move us for two nights to a room facing the pool where we were unfortunately subjected to club noise from approx midnight to 4:30am- walls vibrating - not relaxing at all. Was nice during the day however to sit on the balcony and look out at the pool. As other reviewers have mentioned the rooms are quite small, and while not overly impressive, they have some nice features, and are kept very clean as is the entire hotel. My husband appreciated the great water pressure in shower! The restaurant on site provides good meals at reasonable prices. If your plan is to go to Mamitas (free passes) it's a brisk 15 minute walk, and our experience was you had to be there by 9:00am in order to get chairs/palapas. The hotel pool is more of a \"dipping\" type of pool, not really for swimming. We had a couple of enjoyable days sitting around the pool when there wasn't noise from repairs being done. Overall, not a bad hotel, room for improvements like anything, need to get the noise situation resolved somehow. Don't think the value was there for what we paid.

The hotel is currently redeveloping an area in the solarium, this is part of the block that includes rooms 116 & 117.

Behind the hotel are 2 nightclubs Coco Bongos & the Dubai, and there is nothing to stop the sound between the nightclub and the exterior wall of room 218. It's not just loud, you can actually feel the room vibrating with the beat. After a night of no sleep whatsoever we were moved again (nightclub open until 5:00am!!). When we were moved a second time we were asked to fill in a complaint form as the hotel is having a lot of problems with the noise from the nightclubs (the receptionist showed us a full screen of complaints about the noise to highlight the fact that we were this time getting moved to a room which had not had previous complaints). We were moved to room 119 and although we could still hear the nightclub, we could not feel it, so this was a massive improvement.

This beach looks like a travel poster; turquoise water, beach bar with live music if you want it, miles of sand to walk and escape if you want solitude....much better (and cheaper) than going to Mamitas.", "Date": "February 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "illinois", "Title": "\u201cLa Tortuga never dissappoints\u201d", "Author": "pape51", "ReviewID": "UR24668101", "Content": "Just returned from my fourth visit to La Tortuga.

The hotel is as good as everybody says it is in their reviews. Because there were 4 adults, we got a room that had beds on 2 levels with a terrace and jacuzzi off the second level. The rooms are extremely well kept, clean, and comfortable. The only drawbacks to the rooms were that they are small and there is not a lot of closet or storage space. All the people who work there couldn't have been more helpful. They arranged transportation to and from the airport for us. Arranged a car rental one day, and were very helpful with restaurant and general information. The breakfast that was included was very good and the waiters were very friendly and helpful. I always left a good tip for breakfast and was bothered by people that I observed leaving nothing or very little. All the service personnel work very hard and depend on tips to make a living. I also left the maid a good tip every day to show my appreciation for the excellent job she did cleaning up after the 4 of us. With the car rental, we drove down to the Tulum ruins and on the way back, we stopped in Akumal and snorkeled at Yal-Ku. We went to Cozumel one day on the ferry and was very disappointed. It is very commercial and the vendors in the shopping areas are very aggressive. We took a cab to San Francisco Beach and it was nothing but a commercialized beach club. Zenzi beach club is short walk from the hotel but the beach is not that nice there. Mamitas beach club is a longer walk but is a much nicer beach. Some days we went to the Playa Maya Hotel and rented beach chairs with nice cushions and umbrellas. The food and service at Playa Maya is excellent. The beach is rocky but if you walk a little to the left, the beach is much nicer. Went to the following restaurants: Yaxche, Babe's, Chicago Don Jose, El Baretto, La Famiglia, El Bistro, and Alux. We enjoy nice restaurants and I did a lot research before we left. These are some of the best in Playa. Some are a little pricey for Playa standards, but if you enjoy good restaurants, these are some of the best. Alux restaurant is in a cave and is a 50 peso cab ride but it is worth seeing.

Anna and Jessica informed us about everything we asked for via the internet. When we arrived at the hotel after a total of 24 hours of traveling Lisa gave us a very warm welcome. When we saw our room we couldn\u2019t do anything but stare at it. There was a bottle of Champaign waiting for us, the bed was covered in rose petals, the towels were folded into two swans (the housekeepers folded them differently every day!), we had a rooftop Jacuzzi so we could watch the stars at night and the big LCD TV came in handy after long days of amusement . The next day we came to met Bernardo, the reception worker. The guy is great! He knows everything about Playa del Carmen and the surrounding areas so we constantly harassed him. Luckily he didn\u2019t mind at all and he was always very friendly and helpful. He showed us the best places to go to and explained us how to get there, what to reckon with and what to expect. Lisa, the other reception worker was great as well. She scheduled and rescheduled our excursions and was great fun. The restaurant of La Tortuga (El Bistro) was awesome. They have the best food in the area and for more than acceptable prices. We went to a restaurant in town where I had a piece of salmon with 2 glasses of wine and my wife had a pizza margarita and a bottle of water. We had to pay around 750 pesos (= around 40 euro\u2019s). At El bistro we had more and better wine, way better salmon and the greatest service and hospitality for literally less than half the price. Because it was our honeymoon, one evening we had a private dinner on top of the restaurant. It looked so unbelievably pretty with all the candles and lanterns. Pablo, the restaurant manager, was our waiter and we liked him from the first second on. He is just so nice! We were allowed to pick any bottle of wine (even more than 1, but we\u2019re not that much of drinkers) and anything we wanted of the menu. He gave us a private flamb\u00e9 show and was of the best service I\u2019ve ever experienced. In the morning they had a young team of breakfast waiters (Santiago, Daniel and one more who\u2019s name I forgot (sorry!)) and they were so much fun! They did everything to make their guests feel at home. The last morning, just before we had to go home, they did some tricks with cutlery and one of them made a grasshopper out of a piece of reed as a farewell gift. The barkeepers were Daniel and Fidel. They really made the best Mohito\u2019s in town. Not only better than in the Netherlands, but also better than all the bars I\u2019ve tasted them in Mexico. And they were cheap! The Margarita\u2019s we\u2019re great as well. There was one particular Margarita (La Tortuga\u2026 ) that was more expensive than the rest but so good! It had Gran Marnier and Tequila in it and I\u2019m planning on begging for the recipe. The housekeepers did an outstanding job. We heard lots of British, American and Dutch people complaining about the cleanliness in their all-inclusive resorts, but our room was as clean as it can be every single day. My wife is allergic to dust so that was great! A very nice extra were the figurines the housekeepers made every morning of the clean towels. And special thanks goes to Alfonzo who assisted at the reception and supervised the pool- and garden area! This is becoming kind of a large piece of text.

Also, we weren't so close to the busy nightlife where it was terribly loud. The windows and walls are well insulated and it's very quiet. Thier restaurant next door (Le Bistro) is quite nice.

It was, of course, way too short. We had arranged for the hotel to provide our transportation from the airport and were very pleased. The driver was waiting for us and off we went. Having landed at 10:30, we were in our room before noon. Check in was quick and easy. Front desk staff were always friendly and I never had to open a door. Our room was the standard room, and have to say, it was quite standard. I would have liked to have seen some of the other rooms, but in the end, we were happy with our cozy set up. We had a small balcony overlooking the gorgeous pool area as well. Our room included a frig with bottled water and sodas for an additional charge, but the prices were very reasonable. You were also allowed a one time coffee use. Room amenities, like shampoo, were also quite decent. We never went without hot water for our shower. Vanity space was very limited ladies, but it is a basic room, afterall. Beds were firm and comfortable, not hard as a board and awkward. Breakfast is included, and it is off the menu, not just donuts and coffee. We aren't breakfast or morning people, but found ourselves taking advantage of this because it was offered up until 12 noon! We also enjoyed dinner one night at the Bistro to take advantage of our 50% discount. Even without the discount, the prices were a steal! We loved the atmosphere of the grounds. The pool area was very nice and found it relaxing to sit in the afternoon. Don't expect much sun, however they have an area a floor up with a few comfy beds and all the sun you need! The water in the pools was dramatically cold. We spent nearly 45 min inching our way in one day to finally make the plunge. We lasted about a minute before having to get out. They do have, however, the hottest hot tub in town. What a difference from the pool. One afternoon we decided to take advantage of Mamitas beach club. Included are two chairs and an umbrella. It is about 10 blocks away, which really isn't a bad walk. It's kind of a busy beach, and when we arrived at about 11am, we had no problems getting chairs, but the umbrellas were already taken. This would be a short stay as we can only take the direct sun for so long. Let me say that the beach and water were possibly the nicest we have seen in a long time. Unbelievably gorgeous water! After about an hour, one of the waiters let us know an umbrella had opened up. Very nice of him, as there were plenty of people that probably would have liked the umbrella! We then were able to relax a bit and enjoy a few beverages and some nachos. Great food and very reasonable. The walk back was a bit longer as we were hot from sitting out. Oh well, we certainly survived. Ah, to be that hot again as it is barely zero degrees here today at home. The small pool bar is cozy and friendly (just like the whole hotel itself.) We enjoyed a few very well made drinks one night, checked our email on the computer supplied at the bar, and were only a few steps from our room. That's what we love about these small boutique hotels-everything is right where you need it! Possibly one of the best features (for us) was the location. Just off of 5th, you felt like you were definately out of the action enough and yet close enough to be there in seconds. Plus, you were smack dab in the middle of 5th, which was really nice. We couldn't have asked for a better location. All in all, we highly recommend La Tortuga. If your room is important to you, I do suggest that you consider booking one of the \"better\" rooms.

The hotel is small and once inside offers a degree of tranquility. (With an exception noted below). Located one block away from the main shopping street (5th Avenue), it is easy walking distance to beaches and all the activity. Unlike most of the large all inclusive resorts sprouting up like weeds on Riveria Maya, the hotel has charm and individuality. (Also its less expensive if you do the math. We averaged about $130/day per person. You can also choose from 200 restaurants instead just a few) My only negative comments would be that the pool is not heated and was not just cold but frigid (Hace Frio). At night it gets to about 65 degrees and the pool is in the shade all day so it never warms up. You really can't stay in for too long. Also, the hotel almost resembles and amphitheater, with sound carrying easily. We had a wedding party that was staying in the hotel, and they decided to party from 3AM to 5AM so sleep was out of the question (even with the balcony doors closed). I also wish the hotel had a on-line booking system to make reservations easier. Some pointers. The hotel offer passes to two beaches, we preferred the one in town (Zensi) on 10th Ave. You can use the beach pass they give you for mamitas (This beach club was really crowded even in off season). It is not free, but they wave the fee if you spend $20 or more (quite easy to do buying drinks from the wait staff). We Carboncitas as recommended here. It was the best food of the trip. Most Playa restaurants while inexpensive were only average or below. The restaurant itself is quite unimpressive, however. You will be tempted to walk away. We used the car service from the hotel. It was a good deal for $98 (plus tip). On time and helpful. We expressed interest in seeing Porto Morales, and the driver offered to take us on the way to airport for no extra fee (although we gave him a bigger tip). You want to arrange transport ahead of time in Cancun its quite chaotic to wait until you arrive. Use the Bank ATMs to get Pesos. Don't exchange money there. You always get a much better rate. We got 13.8 from ATM versus 12.5 in town. Don't pay for items in stores with dollars, the exchange rate they will give you will be horrible. They will assume you cant so the math. Many tried to give us a rate of 10 pesos/dollar. We had a superior room which was quite adequate. I can't see spending the extra dollars for the bigger rooms because on average you will only spend a few daylight hours inside. The difference will pay for all your daily meals.

The location and size of the hotel is perfect to host a small group. People could be at the pool, lounge area or bar and meet up with others easily. The hotel is walking distance to everything you need - shops, bars, restaurants, etc. Anna was wonderful to work over e-mail for months of planning and Lisa was at the desk each night to offer ideas for the next day and dinner recommendations. The food in El Bistro is terrific, the small bar has happy hour each evening and all the staff is so helpful and friendly. We stayed in two different suites - one was a regular junior suite and one was the deluxe junior suite. Both had great pool views and comfy beds. Many of the rooms have been renovated. The only negatives I can think of are that the rooms still have bed spreads - they are not horrible looking but I travel quite a bit and think that all bedspreads should go away and be replaced with down comforters and washable duvet covers. Also, it is not a loud place at all but you can definitely hear everything going on outside and in adjacent rooms when you are in your room.

We chose La Tortuga based on the reviews on Trip Adviser. We stayed in room 302 from Nov. 24-28, 2008. Here are the details: The Room: Exceptionally clean and comfortable. Although it is true the rooms are small, our room provided everything we needed. It was well equipped with LCD TV, comfortable bed, safe, two closets, double sinks, etc. It felt like home to us and was easy to enjoy. I loved reading on the patio outside, opening the windows and letting the sounds of the city reach us. The Grounds: Pristine. The pool area snakes through the grounds. The pool was chilly but so was the ocean. We didn't swim much, but enjoyed relaxing by the pool and catching some sun. The Service: The staff goes above and beyond to accommodate guests. A special thank you and shout out to the bartenders, Daniel and Fidel. Both were fantastic at their jobs and the bar became our favorite spot for taking coffee/chiladas/tequilas and meeting other folks, practicing our Spanish, and learning about Playa. Also, thank you to Lisa for working so hard to find an out of the way restaurant and checking up on us before and after our stay. The restaurant: Delicious. We ate dinner their once and breakfast everyday. Try the Montulenos- a traditional Mayan dish. Coffee is strong, hot and delicious. Staff is courteous and aims to please. We both left on Friday feeling more rested, relaxed and happy than we had in a long time. La Tortuga was a great choice for us and we'll return as soon as we can.

Prior to making our hotel selections, I reviewed heavily the reviews and feedback shared by other travelers on this and other websites. I'm happy to say that our experience at La Tortuga was as good as we had hoped for based on past reviews. The general atmosphere at La Tortuga is very laid back and relaxing. The rooms are very nice and unique, certainly based on the price point, and the pool area is absolutely beautiful! The only thing we didn't enjoy about the pool was that the water was absolutely freezing, especially given the pool area is mostly shaded. If this pool were heated, I would guess the guests would never leave as the landscaping and scenery is so relaxing. We did take advantage frequently of the hot tub however which was very enjoyable. The restaurant, particularly breakfast, was also excellent and the waiters are a lot of fun to get to know. During our stay, a larger wedding party was using the hotel for their wedding and we got the impression the hotel staff was at times a little overwhelmed, or potentially understaffed for handling both the wedding and serving the other guests. The bar area is a lot of fun but the bar was very often unstaffed, particularly during happy hour which we found somewhat disappointing. During our stay we visited the beach club each day that is recommended, and comped, by the hotel. We liked the club very much and enjoyed the short walk through town each day to get there. This is a very different type of experience than staying beachfront at some big resort but we would highly recommend this alternative for both variety and a more unique experience. While it's always nice to be beachfront, we very much enjoyed the change of pace that came with being a part of the \"in-town\" experience of Playa Del Carmen.

Anna handled all our reservation requests promptly even when we were booking 10 months in advance, and she then handled all the expected changes to our flight times and arranging our airport transfers with ease. It was great to have everything in such capable hands! We arrived very early in the morning on the 23/24th and even though our flight was early, our driver from Zuley was right there waiting for us. When we got to the hotel we were shown directly up to our room (312) which was wonderful! Lovely king size bed with a balcony and jacuzzi on the rooftop, and the bed was so lusciously soft! Unfortunately we did hear some noise from whatever nightclub is around... My husband hears everything and even with the aircon on in the evening he was very conscious of the distant thumping noise... I heard it but could easily ignore it and it didn't bother me at all. The desk staff were fabulous, Lisa and Bernie in particular - they helped us with so many questions about Playa and excursions. We did the Mayan Encounter through Altournative, and when the winds were so high the harbour was closed so we couldn't dive, Bernie quickly got us booked on a tour to Chichen Itza. Both tours were very good! They also helped us find this fabulous candle shop we heard of through the PDC forum - Artevelas - I love looking at those gorgeous candles now that we are home and remembering PDC... The location of the hotel is also fabulous - so close to all the action and the beaches! I know being close to the nightlife contributed to the nightclub noise that bugged DH, but I thought it was well worth it to be that close to everything. Definately go to Ah Cacao for a treat or two - it is so close, and the brownies are to die for! And our favorite restaurant, Carboncitos, is nice and close - we ate lunch there as many times as we could! We also tried La Pesca (not impressed), Yache (ok), and Babe's (ok overall- but great margaritas!), and La Cueva del Chango (50/50 on this one) - all within walking distance from the hotel! The beaches were beautiful! We walked to Zenzi but preferred the wider, more popular beach at Mamitas and went there three days of our week - gorgeous! Even when the winds were high and the red flags up elsewhere on the beach, at Mamitas you could still swim and the lifeguards were out in full force so you always felt that someone was around if needed. Walking along the beach, though, back to the hotel the beach erosion in front of some of the big resort hotels is quite evident, so I was really glad we had the option of Mamitas to enjoy! We also would like to say a big thank you to our waiters at El Bistro - Jose in the morning and Marco at night. - the staff everywhere at the hotel were terrific and really made the trip! The breakfasts were fabulous (I haven't had that much fresh OJ for years, and my husband is still missing the chilaquiles... I loved the sincronizadas!), and the suppers were excellent and so reasonable with the 50% discount on three meals. We highly recomend the filet mignon and the beef filet with porcini mushroom sauce! We would definately return to Playa in a heartbeat, and I would only think of booking back with La Tortuga - just perhaps in another junior suite on the other side of the building that was a bit more sheltered from the noise?...

She was great too, although we never met her in person! We also loved Alfredo- he's the best! We were greeted with a rose petal-sprinkled bedspread and a bottle of chilled champagne when we arrived. We had two different rooms during our stay; a third floor Junior Suite with rooftop jacuzzi and a swim-up room also with rooftop jacuzzi. The swim up room was bigger and had a nicer bathroom, but we actually really liked the smaller third floor room. It was room 306, we think, and it had the BEST little patio outside the room with a view of the pool where we could just relax and have a beer and enjoy the tropical weather. We never had trouble with bugs and the a/c worked great. The pool is beautiful and refreshing, and the restaurant is FANTASTIC. With the coupons they give you, it's a steal too. The wait staff is very friendly and accommodating. And that you get free breakfast there every morning is so nice and relaxing. The hotel gives you beach towels and passes to either Mamitas or Zensi. We walked to both beach clubs and enjoyed both, although we liked Mamitas best. We actually liked that it was a bit more crowded and the servers were more accessible, and you don't have to order anything. And there were no water sports to speak of there, whereas there were some boats and jet skis nearby Zensi. (And you are supposed to spend $10) We walked to Fifth Avenue often in the evenings and found a couple of laid back bars. Some of the restaurants are a bit too touristy and expensive but you should try Babe's Noodle bar - delish and inexpensive. We also went off of Fifth to some local places and had good luck. Each day we had clean towels, new toiletries and a clean room. After some rain there was a sewer back up and our bathroom had a smell for a few days but the hotel was accommodating and brought up some air fresheners twice. It's Mexico, you gotta deal with it and the hotel is very professional. I think some reviews talked about how the tub on the roof takes too long to fill. Really, it's completely not a big deal. So have a beer and wait for it to fill up - what else do you have to do? My husband and I had such a nice, relaxing time here at La Tortuga. From eating yummy food at Le Bistro, to lounging at the pool or having 2 for 1 drinks at the bar, or playing cards on our patio, we really could have never left the hotel and would have had a great time.

We had checked out of our timeshare and were checking into the hotel right around noon (check in time). This was the first time we met Bernardo at the front desk. Check in was simple and efficient. Then we were informed that our room wasn't quite ready yet. Uh-Oh... the panic sets in right? Actually, it turned out alright. They gave us hotel towels and a voucher for the beach club mamita's. We went and got our swim suits, changed at the hotel, and went to the beach club for a few hours. The beach club is worth a visit.

We are quite picky when it comes to hotels and restaurants - La Tortuga surpassed our expectations. First, in terms of location - it's in a great place to experience both the beaches and the village/shops and restaurants. It's a 5-10 minute walk to the beach and one block away from 5th Avenue, where most of the shops/restaurants are. Second, ambiance - the hotel is relaxing - the pool flows throughout the grounds and the open air bar/restaurant is a great place for any meal. There are a lot of places to go and relax - by the pool, in the open air lounge, the solarium (one thing to note is that the pool area is not really a place to get sun - it is a lush area with trees and pockets of sunshine - anyone wishing to tan would prefer to use the sun deck or go to the beach). In terms of amenities, you get a lot for your money here (please note that we stayed here in the low season, so it was even more of a value than during high season) - free admission to two beach clubs located nearby - this was great because it meant we were able to sit on comfortable lounge chairs at the beach! - free breakfast every day - the best part is that they serve breakfast from 7AM until NOON! No rushing to wake up and get down to breakfast! The breakfast is great as well - eggs, pancakes, etc... - 1/2 price off of three meals at The Bistro - La Tortuga's restaurant. We only took advantage of this once for lunch because we were out and about a lot, but this is a great value. - the staff is wonderful - they genuinely care and the service is exceptional. - the rooms were great - we were in a third floor room and slept on a comfortable bed. It was quiet and clean. Maid service was exceptional - every evening when we returned to the room, the bath towels were arranged in a sculpture on our bed! Pretty creative! All in all, when we return to Playa Del Carmen, we will definitely want to stay at La Tortuga again. One other thing to note is that this is not the kind of place for families with young children - it's more suited for singles, couples and families with older children.", "Date": "October 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Cayman", "Title": "\u201cA little gem!\u201d", "Author": "CaymanBacchus", "ReviewID": "UR20791707", "Content": "I had only 5 days to recharge the batteries and thought what better place than Playa Del Carmen.

Our balcony looked over the pool area which is another great feature of the hotel and our rooftop Jacuzzi was pretty cool to say the least! The bed was huge and I found it really comfy. Every day when you return you will find that room service had created another piece of art on your bed using your clean towels, it was quite neat to see what they would do next and they always did a great job of cleaning the room etc. Back to the pool, its a cosy layout right beside the bar and surrounded by lovely trees and landscaping, check out the rooftop sun area where you can lay on double cushioned loungers under umbrellas and order drinks and food delivered to your lounger table! We had a late lunch up there whilst basking in the sunshine! El Bistro the restaurant is fantastic, the food is delicious and the prices so reasonable it was tempting to eat there for every meal! The inclusive breakfast is from El Bistro where you get to order something from their yummy breaky menu and it never failed to disappoint! If you love mexican food the Mayan breakfast is to die for! The staff at El Bistro were fantastic too! So yes, Tortuga was truly a neat place to spend time in Playa and so close to 5th ave only a 30 second walk away if that! We also checked out Mamitas beachclub which you can lounge at free witha Tortuga pass and that was really lovely too...

Walking off our deck into the pool was a real treat! We loved that the hotel was a block off the \"main drag\" of Fifth Avenue, but still walking distance to all the fun nightlife and an easy walk to the beach. La Tortuga is not like the all-inclusive, massive city-sized resorts that line the beaches. The staff are friendly and helpful. The small size of the hotel(50 or so rooms) makes it feel almost \"homey\", and we had a great time getting to know the other guests who were there during our stay. The breakfast (that is included with your room!) is VERY filling, we would eat around 10 and skip lunch, which was a good money saver. The hotel pool is beautiful and well maintained, it was a great place to spend the day reading with a margarita in hand. The two things we would do differently on a return trip: - Book excursions outside the hotel. We booked a trip to Chichen Itza through the hotel, and discovered that it was overpriced - others in our van had paid much less for the same trip by booking through one of the vendors on Fifth Ave. - Not pay for the hotel airport shuttle. There are public buses that run from the airport to a bus station about 5 blocks away, for MUCH cheaper than the $50/pp rate that the hotel offers.

We were on our own schedule and it was p e r f e c t!! Plus it was all WAY cheaper than an all inclusive, nothing went to waste! I've vacationed all over the states but I've never been to a place as fantastic as La Tortuga! It was made for us! It was romantic, inviting, cozy, unique, modern, natural, intimidating, clean and fun! Everyone, even the guests, were very welcoming and happy to see us- (I would say we felt at home there but people up here are no where near as hospitable and relaxed). We came to Mexico to chillax, go on some adventures and soak in the sights and tastes of PDC and we did just that and more! We did everything we planned to do but were mostly spontaneous, which was exciting and romantic. I have so many great memories of this hotel but the courtyard was my favorite- the water is cool and clean, the layout is unique and modern, there are plants and trees all around you, and the pool-side bar was almost as fantastic as the servers. We had a swim-up room the first 4 nights which I TOTALLY recommend! We stayed in the Superior room also, which I can't say enough about- private fenced in courtyard, private pool, a huge jacuzzi, huge bed- perfect for two young honeymooners (p.s. the spa is awesome too)! My advice: Stay at La Tortuga! Like I said, this was our first trip to Mexico and they took care of everything!

There is a reason that they are number one in Playa, they earn it. We spent only 4 nights at La Tortuga and wish that we could have spent more time there. Everyone goes out of their way to take care of you, they honestly make you feel like a guest at their home. We had an unfortunate event happen when we first arrived, I lost our passports in the taxi. They made phone calls for us, filed reports for us, printed out paperwork for us, everything and anything they could do to help us out. We did not get the passports back but the hotel staff genuinely cared about us and our situation and did all they could to make us feel better and comfortable. We feel as if we truly made friends with the staff. Anna at the front desk even emailed me the other day to check and see if we made it home okay without passports. A word of advice, always get the taxi number. The food and service at El Bistro was very good. They give you so much food for breakfast (included in your room rate) that you don't need to eat lunch and we didn't any of the 3 days. I highly recommend the Moultenanous and Chiliquales for breakfast. I know my spelling of those is absolutely horrible. For dinner, they have a wonderful grouper with lobster sauce and they even have lobster which was also good but not on the menu. All of their food seemed to be very good and reasonably priced. We stayed in a junior suite, room 302 and it was beautiful. The room was always clean and had a nice bathroom. It had a rooftop jacuzzi which we used almost every night. A word of warning though, if you use the bubbles provided make sure you don't use too much. I accidentally poured in almost half a bottle and bubbles were flying everywhere. We had no street noise and no hotel noise. Things are pretty quiet around there anyway. Even the music at the open bar is soft. The pool was beautiful and very relaxing. They have a hot tub in the pool area as well as a water treadmill too for those who want some exercise. We took the ADO bus to Playa from the Cancun airport and it was an hour long bus ride and only cost $17 for both of us. The busses are very nice and inexpensive for those on a budget who don't wish to arrange private transportation. It's not a chicken bus. The busses are actually better than American Greyhound busses. To get to the busses, walk out of the Cancun airport and walk to the right, you'll see the busses parked there and you can pay the attendant at the bus to get your ticket. You luggage goes underneath. When you arrive at the Playa bus station, walk out to your right to grab a taxi at the corner of Juarez. The fare should only be $3 U.S. don't pay any more. If you wish to hoof it, take a left out of the bus station walk about 5 blocks to Calle 14 and hang a left, La Tortuga is on your left at the end of the street. About a 15 minute walk with hassling from the street vendors on 5th. Hope this review helps. I found La Tortuga on Trip Advisor and I'm glad that I did.

We booked more than thirty days in advance, and we were able to save an additional 10% by paying in advance via PayPal. When we arrived we were greeted outside the airport by our driver that the hotel arranged for us. (They also advised us well to ignore the abundance of salespeople trying to sell transportation and excursions when making our way from customs to our pick up just outside the airport.) A few days before our arrival we called to arrange excursions through the hotel, and Bernardo within 5 minutes had our whole weekend planned. We opted to do half-day tours, so we could spend time on the beach...although we spent more time at the hotel. (One recommendation: If you do not like riding buses or carpooling with others, you may prefer to have private transportation setup.) Upon our arrival Ivan and Bernardo knew us by name, and gave us refreshing non-alcoholic cocktails. We soon met the two bartenders Fidel and Daniel who were extremely nice and attentive to us during our entire 4 night stay. Since we booked a Swim Up room and had direct access to the pool, we could swim up to the bar and drink Pina Coladas made to order...and we didn't have to even leave the pool as a simple nod to Fidel or Daniel meant we were ready for another Pina Colada. The room was a perfect size, and the maid service was exceptional. A couple nights we asked that all our sheets be replaced since we brought in sand from the beach, and they happily replaced them and left us tower sculptures each time. And if being in Playa is not enough of a stress reliever, there is a full spa attached the hotel. We opted for a couples full body massage, and were very pleased. Our last night, we reserved the rooftop terrace for a private dinner. This was the exclamation point to a perfect vacation. We could order anything and everything on the menu...that night they had fresh lobster from the Yucatan that we indulged in. In addition, we had desert flambeed table-side and experienced exceptional service. (The cost was fixed at $120US and was charged to the room.)

If we only knew! So next time we will book at least a week there. The most beautiful and lush tropical grounds with a pool that was \"out of this world\" unique and one last thing, but far from least is that our first night at dinner we paid and added a 20% tip to the bill and when we walked out of the restaurant the waiter (Estaban/Steve ?) came running after us to tell us that the tip was already included and we did not need to double-tip. We were so impressed with the service and honesty (not to mention probably the best fresh lobster we ever had) that we told him to keep the tip anyway! Even the room had a small frig that was stocked with complimentary goodies! (yes complimentary!) Oh and did I forget to mention that if you stay there you get free breakfast and 50% of dinner?

What a great time my boyfriend and I had at La Tortuga. We stayed there from August 11-15th for a bit of a getaway from New Jersey. I picked La Tortuga after reading everyone's reviews so I think it\u2019s only fair I add in my experience. We arranged pickup through the hotel to and from the airport. The ride from Cancun's airport is about an hour in a standard sedan type. Everyone we were in touch with through La Tortuga was extremely friendly. I booked the hotel directly through their website and was given a certain discount because I was booking so much ahead of time! (Any little place to save money helps!) During the drive down to Playa del Carmen, the driver (his name escapes me!) gave us restaurant suggestions as well as how to find our way to Tulum - - a great start to our trip. Our room at La Tortuga was a standard room, number 24. It is right off the bar on the 2nd floor with a small balcony facing the pool. The room was a standard room, with a simple bathroom and amenities. Everyone had said how amazing the beds at La Tortuga were but unfortunately that wasn't the case in our room! I guess ours was missing that great bed. We had absolutely no problems with the room other than the bed as well as at night you do hear the cars driving up and down 10th avenida (a main road). If I may suggest, ear plugs are a great thing to have there! The hotel also provided a safe in the room which made me feel very comfortable knowing my belongings were safely stored while out for the day. As far as restaurants on 5th Avenue, there's a huge amount to choose from. We went to Blue Lobster (sit on the top balcony looking over at the street because mariachi players consistently ask you if you\u2019d like a song played ), 100% Natural (I had an amazing smoothie \u201cOasis\u201d but be aware as far as the ice. . .a general Mexico tip. The food there also was very good), Babe's Noodles (one is near Mamita's beach club but that does not open until 4pm so we went to the one further down 5th avenue). Also one night we walked to Ah Cacao chocolate caf\u00e9 - - it is in the direction towards Mamitas and heading further north (5th ave + Constituyentes). They had amazing chocolate moose and ice cream! For day trips, we took the Colectivo (very easy to use!) that leaves from Calle 2 Norte between Av. 15 and 20. It is probably about a 10 minute or so walk from the hotel. You will see a line of white \u2018minibuses\u2019 lined up and someone comes up to you asking your destination. We were headed to Tulum ruins and specified we wanted the ruins and not the town. I thought it was 20 pesos per person but we were charged 30 pesos. . . I don\u2019t know if prices have changed or they made extra money off of us. The bus is air conditioned (a bit?) and used by tourists and locals. It\u2019s an easy way to get from one destination to another without having to rent a car. The colectivo dropped us off on the road that leads down to Tulum and from there we walked about 10 minutes or so to the entrance. There is a beach at the ruins so you can always plan a full day there, to see the ruins and then relax on the beach. The cost to get into the ruins is about 50 pesos per person. Another day trip was a half day trip I planned as a gift to my boyfriend. We went with Mexico Blue Dream, a company I had also found on Tripadvisor. They have several options for either full day, half-day, etc and me and my boyfriend did the half-day trip to Cozumel. I arranged, through email, for the company to pick us up at La Tortuga because I did not know where they were located. The owner Patrice and his son Pierre picked us up in a cab and from there we went to the Cozumel ferry. The tour was very well priced (I believe 35 per person and then the cost of the Cozumel ferry). Once in Cozumel, Mexico Blue Dream has a set relationship with another snorkeling company there. I do not know how their other tours function but I\u2019m sure as smoothly as ours. With the Cozumel trip we visited 3 different reef sites on a small glass bottom boat. There were about 10 people on the small boat which was a nice, small group. My boyfriend loved the gift and I highly suggest brining underwater cameras to capture the sea life!! I ended up putting together an entire \"playa del carmen\" guide - compiling everyone's reviews here on tripadvisor. It was a great reference for me and my boyfriend as far as finding somewhere to eat for the night and other little tid bits around PDC. If you'd like that, send me a message because I'd be happy to send it around!! Overall our experience in Playa was great! We\u2019d certainly stay at La Tortuga again and try out another room!", "Date": "September 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBest vacation ever\u201d", "Author": "Hassans2", "ReviewID": "UR19604466", "Content": "My wife and I spent our honeymoon at LaTortuga. I can't rave enough about this hotel!!! I booked the hotel based on the reviews by trip advisor. I was a little scared because I saw an occasional review that wasn't great. All I can say about that is trust me, this hotel was wonderful. It was incredibly clean. The shower was great, there was no mold, and the room had no smell of smoke whatsoever. The grounds were meticulous. The pictures simply do not do it justice. It seemed that every time I looked down at the pool there was a person skimming out the occasional leaf. The staff was the best I've ever seen. Oftentimes you encounter staff at hotels who are very nice but for some reason it just doesn't seem that genuine. The people here are genuinely nice. Lisa, Fredo, and our maid Noemi were wonderful. Oftentimes, when we returned to the hotel Fredo and Lisa were there with a smile. It was a nice touch. With the hotel you get free breakfast. You get your choice of what's on the menu at the restaurant next door which is part of the hotel. The restaurant is great. We only ate breakfast there but it was always delicious. The restaurant staff was amazing and at the end of our trip went out of their way to hug us good-bye. You should stay here if you are looking for something a little different from an all-inclusive. This allows you the opportunity to eat lunch and dinner out which is what we were looking for. La Tortuga is in a great location, just steps from all of the action. You get free breakfast, free beach towels, free passes to an awesome beach, and a beautiful scenic ten minute walk to the beach. Finally, it is quiet. No loud noises or parties.

We were married in Playa Del Carmen, and many of our guests stayed in La Tortuga as well. I believe our party had 16 total rooms at the hotel. This was our second stay at La Tortuga. Previously (5/2008), we had stayed in a Standard (or maybe Standard Plus) room, which was comfortable and relaxing. This time, we stayed in a Superior Junior Suite (I forget the number, but it was near the lagoon with a large hammock in front\u2026 maybe 16?). The room was incredible \u2013 the bed, shower, closet, roof terrace with hot tub\u2026 everything exceeded our expectations. I remember the bed in the Standard room being fine, but the bed in the suite was the best I have encountered in Mexico. I was blown away at the friendliness and high quality of service from every employee. Seriously, I didn\u2019t encounter a single bad apple. Every morning we would head to the restaurant and choose from one of the incredible breakfasts (The Mayan-style eggs, or motule\u00f1os, were my wife\u2019s favorite), a cold drink (watermelon/sandia water was excellent, as was pineapple and chaya/Mayan spinach), and a hot drink (if you ordered one of their incredible iced cappuccinos, they would let that count as your hot drink). Hands-down, the greatest \u201cfree continental breakfast\u201d I have ever had at a hotel before. After 10 consecutive days, there were still more items on the menu that I wanted to try. Breakfast was served until noon every day, but one day my brother and his wife were too late. They were then offered lunch instead (equally excellent \u2013 as were the dinner options), and STILL got a free meal. All of the restaurant staff (Jose, Esteban, Pablo, and Danny to name a few) were absolutely top notch. The other staff were excellent as well. At the front desk, Lisa and the man who worked the day shift (I can\u2019t remember his name) always greeted us with a warm smile every time we passed through the lobby. They were very helpful with all of our questions and requests (and with over 30 guests staying at the hotel\u2026 we had quite a few). Alfredo carried bags and opened doors always with a smile. The women who cleaned the rooms were always cheery and left us with a new towel friend every day. Plus, at all times there were countless others working to clean the pool, squeegee the deck, sweep the solarium\u2026 it was all like finely coordinated clockwork that kept the place running smoothly. We stayed in the hotel through a tropical storm, and when we woke up the next day all of the fallen leaves and debris had already been whisked away. I only had two complaints about the hotel. The first was a minor one: the air conditioner leaked water into our room. Sure, I was probably at fault by pushing it too hard and trying to create \u201cthe coldest room in Mexico\u201d\u2026 but it was kind of a bummer to wake up to water dripping on some of our things. The second complaint is a bit more significant: the hotel\u2019s swimming lagoon was far TOO appealing for my own good. With so many sights to see in Playa and the surrounding areas, there were many days when I found myself missing out on daytrips, beach adventures, etc. because I was drawn to the lagoon. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go around another time\u2026 let me go swim under the deck again \u2026 okay, just five minutes playing in the water treadmill \u2026 fine, fine, how about visiting our friends in the swim-up room \u2026 what\u2019s that you say, I can order a drink while I relax on this sunning platform OR in the hot tub \u2026 sweet, but then I am going to hide under the bridge\u2026\u201d I think one of the other guests summed up the lagoon best when she said that the lagoon made you feel like you were in elementary school all over again. Lots of fun\u2026 but I found it very difficult to pull myself away! I still have dreams about that lagoon. Hotel La Tortuga is hands-down the best hotel I have stayed at or visited in Playa Del Carmen. It has the perfect blend of service, facilities, atmosphere, and location. While Playa Del Carmen has many great hotels, this one simply can\u2019t be beat. Our guests were spread out over 8 different hotels for our wedding, yet everyone was drawn to the Turtle.

We had let the hotel know that this was a second honeymoon for us as our honeymoon proper had been a disaster. When we were shown our room we were delighted and surprised to find that the bed was decked out with petals and flowers and lovely towel sculptures! There was also a bottle of Cava chilling for us. Lovely touch and much appreciated. We were in a swim-up room. It was amazing to be able to step out of the room and into the water. The room itself is fine. We had 2 queen size beds as all the king sized had been booked up. The beds are comfortable and the air conditioning is very welcome. There is a safe and mini-bar in the room; although restocking of the minibar was a bit haphazzard. Our coffee was never replenished and the bar itself wasn't refilled for a few days. The bathroom was not great. The shower was abysmal. It was nearly impossible to wash my hair as there was not enough water to get the shampoo out of it. The pool is very nice, although it seems to be very highly chlorinated. It turned my husbands white board shorts a lovely green!!!! The staff are exceptional. Nothing is too much hassle and everything was carried out with good grace and a smile. Makes a huge difference. Beach clubs: We tried both places during our stay. Mamitas is free with your voucher. It is a little bit of a walk but not too bad. It gets very very busy though and the music is very loud and quite annoying. Zenzi is much closer and much quieter. If you spend ten dollars each on food you get your beds free. The food is really really good here so you should have no trouble spending the money! One thing to watch though is that the canopies do not offer much shade. The sun can still shine through and burn. Just watch out! The main complaint I have is to do with the room. One afternoon we were taking it easy as I was sick for a few days. We were watching tv in our room when we noticed someone on our terrace. He was moving around and then tried to open the door. Luckily we had it locked. My husband shouted and the man left very quickly. We rang the front desk and informed them what had happened. They told us they would get security on to it. Later on my husband went down to check on something else and asked them what had happened. They told him that it had been a man who was having lunch at the restaurant and said he wasnted to \"see the rooms\"!!!!!! He was escorted of the property.

The bathroom was beautiful (although the lighting was not the best). Also, house keeping never hung up our towels let alone replaced them (not a big deal, but worth a mention). We did not use our jaccuzzi tub on the roof top, but we did frequent the pool in the afternoons (very nice). The restaraunt was wonderful as was the bar (try the palmarita's or the mojito's). There was construction early (8:00am in the morning) but we are early risers. We did not hear any music from the night clubs. Overall, it was a great stay, and I would not hesitate to return.", "Date": "July 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Andover, MA", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Choice in Playa!\u201d", "Author": "Explorer_from_Boston", "ReviewID": "UR17338845", "Content": "Stayed at La Tortuga in mid June while in Playa for a wedding, traveling with my brother. Had read good reviews and agree that the hotel is a great find. Staff - cannot say enough, they were excellent, friendly, helpful, and well trained. Anna in particular was great and helping to make arrangements prior to the trip via email. Laura was also helpful. Rooms - rooms are clean and comforable. I had a swim up room and my brother stayed in a standard plus. They were a little small but perfect for one person. Couples might want to stay in a slightly larger room, but would recommend them all. The air conditioners were a little noisy, but I got used to it. Bath products are great and towels shapped like animals were fun! Food - breakfast was excellent, great choices. Other meals were good and sitting outside to eat was really nice. Spa - spa is very nice, though double check if you are getting your nails done that the staff is trained. I had a great massage and body treatment, but the woman doing my nails had not been trained and it took multiple trys so I would not recommend nail services until Spa Itza hires/trains real manicurists. It was slow, so maybe they use used this woman who was a trained masseuse. But, nail services were not worth the money and I should have just done it myself. I was dissapointed after getting a great pedicure there the year before, during a trip to Playa in 2007. Tours - the hotel will arrange tours at reasonable prices. We went snorkling off the beach. If they don't have a tour that meets your needs they will recommend someone. Pool - very peaceful and cool....extremely nice pool and refreshing on VERY hot days (beware that it is very hot in June!).

Eight of us stayed there in May/June 08 for our wedding (coordinated by the hotel's wedding planners, Caribbean Blue Weddings, which we highly recommend), and we couldn't have asked for a better hotel for this very special occasion! From the beginning, our emails to Anna Bassi were responded to very quickly and with such helpfulness and friendliness, I felt as if we had been friends for years :). Her assistance in providing me with preliminary information on having a wedding there was fantastic, and made our decision to hire Caribbean Blue Weddings very easy. Upon arrival, we were greeted so warmly by Anna and Alfredo, making check-in a breeze (those welcome drinks made it even more pleasant :). Our party had 2 standard plus rooms and 1 standard before the wedding, then my hubby and I stayed in a junior suite thereafter. The standard plus rooms were roomy (one was more roomy than the other...all the rooms at the Hotel are configured a little differently, lending to its charm) with a nice balcony overlooking the wonderful pool oasis at the center of the hotel. The standard room my aunt and uncle had was quite small but nicely appointed, and a good bargain considering the price! The junior suite was great, very spacious and with a nice jacuzzi on the rooftop - very romantic! (staff also beautifully decorated the room for our wedding night - a nice touch with the complimentary champagne too!) All the staff at the hotel and restaurant (Bistro) were excellent, almost all of them knew we were getting married and made it a point to show how happy and excited they were for us, which made us feel right at home. The food at Bistro was excellent! We ate the included breakfast there every day and were very impressed with the quality and quantity. We had dinner there our first night and it was great too. On the day of our wedding the van that was supposed to pick us up broke down, so the wedding planners and the front desk staff (special thanks to Fernanda!) were on it to get us to the chapel as quickly as possible, and it all worked out fine. Bernardo was another staff member who was very helpful and nice to us too...I wish we could remember all the others' names, but honestly every person we came in contact with was awesome. We love that the hotel was not all-inclusive and not a mega resort (only 51 rooms). It's location was perfect...although it's not on the beach you are only a block from the action on 5th Ave and a couple blocks to the beach. We went to Mamita's beach club (the hotel gives you a voucher) one afternoon and loved it...it is a bit of a walk but well worth it. The sand is so soft, no rocks and the water is just gorgeous. Food and drinks there were good too! The only thing that I want to point out to future guests is that the hotel does not have an elevator....while we had no problems with having our luggage brought up, we were traveling with older family members so at times they were a little tired going up and down (but it didn't take away from them liking the hotel, in fact they can't wait to go back!). Also, the jacuzzi didn't have a railing to easily get in/out, so my dad who's in his 70's had a little bit of trouble. Aside from those two minor issues, we LOVED La Tortuga and CAN'T WAIT to return!!!!!!!

What a great way to welcome us from a long day of flying across the country. Anna, Alfredo, Bernado, Marco were all wonderful. I also have to mention one of the front desk person( I'm sorry I didn't get her name) she has an English accent, she was wonderful made us feel at home! We had the swim up room and it was great!

I looked outside and he was cutting the grass with his hands using the long scissor like tool. ( sorry I don't know what its call, maybe a branch trimer?) All of them work so hard in the hot sun to make our stay an enjoyable one. We sure appreciate their hard work! The only thing I would suggest for the people that booked their transfer from the hotel is once you get outside of the airport, head towards the bus area. When we walked outside and saw people holding up signs and thought this must be the place to wait. We waited and waited and kept looking for a yellow shirt guy holding a sign with our name for about 30 minutes. In the meantime we had about 5 people coming up to us wanting us to take a taxi from them, for cheap but we kept saying \"no thank you\". Finally I went inside to call the hotel to have them page the driver who was there, but in a different area. He said he was talking to his friends and was waiting in the bus area. Who would have known to go there? I saw many people with signs waiting for their guests and thought that this was the right place to wait.

When I arrived last Monday, there was a problem with my room, so I was upgraded to what I think was a Jr. Suite. It was room #116, by the pool. There was a large patio with table and chairs and a hammock that could be strung up. The room was lovely, the bathroom fantastic and a door in the bathroom that led outside and up to a private rooftop sundeck with jacuzzi. I don't think it would afford enough privacy to be naughty, but definitely made me think that this is somewhere I'd want to take a significant other. My friend who was vacationing with me flew in the next day, so I got my bearings by wandering around 5th Ave, which is only one block from the hotel. Tons of shops, restaurants and people watching to keep you busy. I had room service that night...the food from the hotel restaurant was good, nothing I craved again later, but it was fine. I went to the Mamita's beach club the next morning...after breakfast it was a welcoming walk. I don't know why anyone has complained about the walk...perhaps they're not in very good shape and the walk was taxing? When my friend arrived that afternoon, we had to wait around to be moved into the new room, which was a minor inconvenience...I had things in the safe so wasn't comfortable with the hotel staff's suggestion that they move my belongings for me. The person at the desk was a little difficult as he was wanting me to vacate the room I had stayed in the night before because he had other people coming, but didn't have my room. So we had to wait around an hour at the hotel waiting. After the upgrade, the swim up room was a little disappointing. No tub, only a shower and just didn't have the same high end feel of the other room. Probably wouldn't have thought anything of it had I not stayed in the other room first. The swim up room is a novelty...we could have certainly gotten by just fine without the swim up, but I appreciated being close to the pool, bar and restaurant, especially when I saw people trudging up the stairs. Babe's Noodle House was a good spot for lunch, we had a dinner at John Gray's Place...my friend didn't think her dinner was that great, but I enjoyed mine. However, it did have the feel of most typically higher end restaurants. While the staff was pleasant, they were nowhere to be found after our food was delivered...they hung out with each other and ignored us. Our favorite place to eat was El Oasis...best shrimp tacos ever...we went back 3 times! La Parilla and Media Luna on 5th Ave. were not good at all, I wouldn't waste your time. Food was definitely not a highlight for us on this trip. We took the ADO (bus) to Tulum and to Xel-Ha...it was easy and cheap, about $4.40 each way...defnitely cheaper than securing a tour. Xel-Ha is a beautiful place, but I think the price tag is high because of the all-inclusive angle...the food was not very good and I didn't want to overindulge in cocktails or beer since we'd be in the hot sun all day. I enjoyed the bicycles and snorkeling...don't know if I'd go again now that I know what it's all about. All in all, it was an enjoyable stay, the hotel and pool are truly beautiful and I can't wait to show off my photos to friends. I think if I stay here again it will be with a boyfriend though....my friend and I appeared to be the only ones not part of a \"couple\"...lots of honeymooners around as well.

They have recently changed their mattresses, for the better, so they are no longer the typical rock hard mattresses found in most Mexico hotels.

Central pool/garden/lounging area was very attractive and comfortable. Complimentary breakfast offered a welcome range of choices and the 15% off coupons were appreciated for lunches. The nachos supreme were the best weve ever had & we couldnt resist ordering them several times. The staff was very accomodating. Example 1: We were tired and wanted to rent a DVD to watch and have a night in. The staff brought and hooked up a DVD player in our room and then accompanied our daughter to Blockbuster to rent a movie using their card. Example 2: At our request, the staff emptied the room fridge of minibar food and allowed us to stock it with drinks and fresh food of our choice. Wonderful! Regarding restaurants, there are so many in the area and yet we never had anything approaching a bad dining experience. We even had fun at La Cueva del Chango (the Cave of the Monkeys), which serves what is accurately described as hippie-Mexican food and has a stream running through the restaurant.

Alltournative tours is also a great group, combining seeing Tulum with swimming in cenotes, seeing a Mayan ritual, biking and ziplining (with a significant pucker factor). Quite a day!

While the place is beautiful there are a few needs improvements. Let me first start with the positives. The beds, ohhhhh the beds, I have never in my life slept so well, they were amazing, the linens were very clean, the bed was comfortable, we called for extra pillows and they were brought up promptly. Thanks to the people who wrote about them not providing wash cloths, I brought my own. The first day there were two wash cloths, the second day there were none, so we called, they brought dish rags, they were the size of wash cloths but they had a texture on them that didn't make it very comfortable to wash your body with. I took out the wash cloth I brought and used that the rest of the time. I loved the towel art we found on our bed every evening. The air conditioning was amazing in the room, unfortunately housekeeping always turned the air off, so when we arrived back to our room after a hot and sticky day, our room was a little uncomfortable, but it cooled down quickly. We reserved a junior suite with the roof top Jacuzzi, the Jacuzzi takes about 45 minutes to an hour to fill up, so keep that in mind if you want to book a Jacuzzi room. The location is great, you are on block from 5th avenue, and the beach is a few blocks away, not as bad a walk as everyone makes it out to be. We barely heard the music from the bar that so many people wrote about. A few suggestions for the hotel. 1. It would be great to have the staff come around the pool during happy hour to ask if you would like a cocktail. On another happy hour note, let the guests know what time the happy hour runs when they check in. 2. It would also be nice to offer appetizers to purchase during the happy hour. 3. We had terrible luck with dining; it would be nice to offer to send your bellmen to some of the local dining establishments so they could suggest some dining options. It was the biggest thing we missed about staying at a smaller hotel, no concierge to make recommendations. 4. Let the guests know when they check in if they want to use the room safe, you have to get the lock from the desk, we were creative with hiding our credit cards and jewelry. We finally asked if someone could come fix the safe in our room when they told us they provide the locks. 5. While there are no non-smoking rooms at this facility, you could not smell any second hand smoke in the rooms. What was disappointing was there was no designated non smoking area for breakfast, if you are a non smoker, there is no better way to ruin a meal then trying to eat with someone\u2019s smoke billowing over your food. There were a lot of smokers at this facility who would actually have a fork in one hand and a cigarette in the other, take a bite, and take a puff. Thank God my husband is so patient with me and didn't mind moving away from the smokers, although there was no escape. 6. Housekeeping might want to check the soap and toilet paper supply when they clean the rooms. We had to call down to ask for more toilet paper and soap, that's a first for us for staying in a hotel. 7. Slippers in the room would be nice since the tile floor is a little dusty, and leaves a film on your feet when you get into bed at night. I wore my thongs from the time I got out of the shower; I didn't think to bring any slippers. Some of the above and beyond things that we found at La Tortuga. Jose the waiter was so personable and friendly; he would come and shake our hands every time we saw him. The wait staff has a difficult time communicating because their English is so limited, but what they lack in their communication skills they make up in their warmth and welcoming attitude. Anna and another person working there went above and beyond looking for the directions to a monkey reserve we had read about. We ended up getting really lost but the effort was not forgotten. Alfredo the bellman, he usually worked nights, was amazing, we wanted to take a cab to a place we had read about (La Cueva Del Chenga, don't waste your time, it was the worst!) He pulled 3 cabs over to make sure we were getting an honest and fair deal. We just loved him; we couldn't believe the extra effort he went to for us. Some of the dining bloopers we at were Madras Tierra, don't waste your time, and the other La Cueva del Chenga, those two were the worst! The best Mexican food was at La Cocina at XCaret, it was amazing! We also really liked Yaxche, Babes noodle house was very good to. Le Bistro was good too I ordered the chopped steak expecting a ground chopped steak burger and got a bone in rib eye with caramelized onions that were amazing. Don't miss trying dinner at Le Bistro, the food is very good. Overall it was a nice experience, all the hype about how everyone was so friendly was a little over rated, there were a few that stood out, other times there were people who sat at the front desk who never bothered to lift their head to say hello when you walked in the door. When you walked by the housekeeping staffs who were always working to keep the place clean, they were always friendly and said hello. If you are planning on staying at La Tortuga here are a few items we suggest you bring. 1. An insulated water bottle, the hotel does not provide free bottled water, you can go across to the OXXO and buy a couple of bottles, or you can bring your own and fill them up at the water coolers located next to the pool tables. 2. Slippers for in the room already mentioned. 3. If you don't speak Spanish bring a translation book. 4. Wash cloths. 5. A sweat towel to carry around when you walk around town because it is so steamy hot! 6. Bring a hat. 7. Make sure you make time to take the ferry to Cozumel, the water was amazing. And last but not least, we could not end this review without mentioning Happy Hands the $33.00 massage, the place is located next to 100% Natural and is amazing, we went twice. The first was the deep tissue, the second was the relaxing massage and both were amazing, the place was clean, the staff was excellent, and the price was a bargain. When you leave La Tortuga, and you were impressed with the staff, don't hesitate to give them a little extra tip. You will notice they aren't tipped in the morning when you get your free breakfast, these guys work hard and any little extra means a lot.", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando,FL", "Title": "\u201cquiet and romantic\u201d", "Author": "wasame", "ReviewID": "UR16151036", "Content": "La Tortuga grounds are what stand out to me the most, especially the courtyard pool area. The hotel felt very private and quiet. This was our ten year anniversary and when we arrived in our room, there was champagne, roses on the bed, and a note to us on the bed as well. I think my expectations of the front desk were set high because of all I read on tripadvisor before I came so I was a bit disappointed with that.Check in was smooth with cocktail drinks served, a nice touch. Fernanda, I believe her name was, was friendly,knowledgeable and helpful. However after the first few days of our stay, a gentleman was then working the front desk who seemed unfamiliar with the front desk position. Example of this is Fernanda called my room the day before I checked out to see if I would like to get a boarding pass printed for my flight the next day. When I went downstairs to do so, she was gone, and the gentleman looked at me puzzled when I mentioned it and said they dont print boarding passes and that I needed to go across the street to the cyber cafe and do it over there. After I explained that Fernanda called my room about this, he said he would make an exception but they usually dont do this and had me walk around the desk and use the front desk's personal computer. I felt awkward. Also, when I asked him for restaurant suggestions he was puzzled and couldnt recommend any to me although he looked through a drawer for some restaurant menus. The bellman always opened the door into the lobby for us which was nice and was polite and helpful. There is happy hour by the way between 5-6 pm where you get 2 for 1 drinks (mixed drinks costs 60-70 pesos usually which is 6-7 dollars so you get 2 drinks for that price from 5-6). After a day at the beach or site seeing it was nice to come back for cocktails by the pool area. The restaurant's prices were reasonable as well. (breakfast was free) I dont know about 50% discount for lunch and dinner like someone else mentioned on here. You may want to ask the hotel about that. The first 3 nights we stayed in a jacuzzi suite with a rooftop jacuzzi. This room is larger than the standard rooms (which we stayed in the last night). The bathrooms in the suites are also modern with bowl sinks and shower glass doors and much nicer than the standard rooms (regular sinks and older bathrooms). Also jacuzzi suite had flat panel tv with good reception and standard room #24 had regular tv with fuzzy reception. But they were both clean and well cared for. I would recommend the suites if you can swing it.

The rooms were just the right size, the bed very comfortable, the in room mini refrigerator was great for keeping water, beer, soda and whatever cold. The service was fantastic - the front desk booked a trip for us to Chichen Itza, which was wonderful but don't take the trip it you get car sick from bumping around - the trip takes 2 1/2 hours each way!! But was great and well worth it. The shuttle service to and from the hotel was great too - for $98 USD both ways for 2, you can't beat it. They were on time, which was appreciated! They also decorated the room the day of my birthday with balloons. They had 2 pieces of cake and a bottle of champagne chilling too - that was such a wonderful touch and very thoughtful. The hotel does do a good job on the little things! The breakfast was great and the menu had enough variety for us. The OJ was yummy! We didn't eat here for lunch or dinner as we were out and about. For a quick and good Mexican meal, try Oasis just around the corner from the hotel. Great margs and more reasonable than most places on 5th Ave. We did use the 2 beach clubs that come with your hotel stay. Zenzi was not very crowded, but you do need to spend $30 USD to get the chairs for free. No big deal if you are staying all day and eat lunch there. Mamitas doesn't require you to have a minimum purchase, it is a little bit of a walk, but not bad. The beach is more beautiful and they have palapyas, which tended to keep the sun out better than the cloth shades at Zenzi. Now some not so good - the traffic outside our room at night was terrible - very, very noisy. The first night, I don't think I slept much... We eventually got used to the rumbling, but bring ear plugs!! We did figure out how to turn the fan on high on the AC and that did help drown out some of the noise!! But the thumping was not easy to get rid of!! During the day everything is great, but the nights were kind of tough with all the noise. Not much they can do about the traffic, but just be aware of it it your room is on the street side. Overall, our experience was fantastic. This was our 5th time in Playa but our first without kids.

I\u2019ve previously stayed at Gran Porto Real, Copacabana (Catalonia Tulum now I think), Iberostar Paraiso del Mar and Iberostar Cozumel. It was my friend\u2019s third time down here and he\u2019s previously been to the Iberostar del Mar and Oasis Grand Cancun. Having done only all-inclusive before, we wanted to try something non-AI so we could go into town and eat and explore on our own a bit. So we booked here the first three nights of our trip before moving to the Royal PDC. We were so glad we did! We booked directly on the website and Anna was very quick and pleasant to work with over email. We used their one way transfer from the airport for 55. Check in was very quick. We booked a junior suite with two double beds and the rooftop jacuzzi. The room was very nice and had a balcony overlooking the pool. We never got around to using the rooftop jacuzzi because it was very hot up there during the day and we were usually wiped out by the time we got back to the room at night. The beds were very comfortable and there is a mini bar in the room. You have access to two beach clubs while you are there \u2013 Mamitas and Zenzi. We used Zenzi because it was closer and I heard it was less crowded. You pick your passes up at the desk with your towels and you receive two chairs and an umbrella if you spend 20 ( I think) in food or drinks. Make sure you check the receipt before you leave because they forgot to take off the charge for our chairs and umbrella, but quickly corrected it when I pointed it out. Zenzi was nice and clean. The pool at the hotel is very peaceful and we liked relaxing there in the afternoon after the beach or being out. There is a bar at the pool and the drinks are great. The breakfast at the hotel was delicious and the menu had plenty to order from. We never got around to eating at the restaurant for lunch or dinner, but they do give you a discount for staying at the hotel and the menu looked good. The service here is top notch. We rented a car to drive to Tulum one day and hit up the Mega on the way back to stock up on beer and stuff for the room. They saw me walking in with our bags and immediately took them up to our room. Everyone was always willing to go out of their way for you. Tips: 1. Bring bug spray because I got a lot of mosquito bites around the pool probably because of the vegetation. 2. Eat at Casa de Agua in town. BEST meal in PDC ever. Pricey but definitely worth it! 3. Pizza Pazza is all over town and has great pizza. 4. Go to the Mega to stock up on drinks and snacks to save money for while down at the pool. After three nights we headed off to the Royal PDC, but we both agreed we would stay at La Tortuga again. In fact, we\u2019re planning to go there again for a couple nights next year, followed by the Royal PDC again and then extending the vacation on to the Royal Cancun!

This hotel offers personalized, unparalleled customer service (from Anna at Customer Services, to Fernanda, Alfredo, Bernardo, even the waiters, bartenders and cleaning crew). The team booked our day tours for us (we recommend the Jungle Crossing but not the Sian K'aan one - when we explained to Fernanda what a bad experience we had on this tour - we were the first to take it -- she immediately took measures to correct the situation and went above and beyond the call of duty to help ease a bad situation and instantly agreed not to recommend it to any of their other visitors). They also suggested and reserved restaurants for us, helped my husband plan a suprise day of activities for me, and even bailed us out of a horrible situation when we lost our in-room safe key and needed it drilled open! They handled everything calmly, quickly and efficiently. The team take pride that they are number one in Playa, and they earn this accolade through hard work. We relaxed immediately (an incredibly easy hotel transfer to and from Cancun certainly helped), as did the welcome drink, and enjoyed the immaculately kept grounds, the brilliant lazy river pool (not a place for laps, but a nice cool respite from the heat), and the chilled out hotel atmosphere and slightly more upmarket clientele (no children!). We even made a few friends there! Yes, the rooms are smallish - but are you in Mexico to stay in your hotel room? No! We had a superior plus room that was kept sparkling clean by our maid (who left us with entertaining towel creatures every day!). It's not big, true, but had a huge, comfy bed, a nice bathroom/shower and a cute, private balcony overlooking the pool. What more do you need! (Although I did hear some people complain about the room size, it didn't bother me). The restaurant offered perhaps the best service we experienced in Playa and the meals were prepared fresh and with fine ingredients. Again, all the serving staff were friendly and very, very helpful. The breakfast was just right - and we were offered quite a nice choice of eggs, or croissant, and a hot and cold beverage. You can also top up if you pay a little bit extra and get a yummy fruit and yogurt plate or other extras. As for the \"noise\" of the nearby disco that some of have complained about, with the airconditioning on, we heard it maybe two nights out of the 8 and just put a pair of ear plugs in for a few hours. It really didn't both us too much. There was some early morning construction at a site next door, however, which was a bit irritating, but it was more fun to get up early anyway - and I usually prefer to sleep late! Would I go back?

The hotel is small, but it feels even smaller. The hotel is situated a courtyard covered with beautifully maintained native foliage. A lazy river meanders through the courtyard with small waterfalls. It is very shady due to the large plantain trees & birds of paradise. We rarely saw other guests - usually only @ breakfast or @ the bar in the afternoon. Our room was a swim up room along the lazy river, in the back of the property, across the pool from the bar on the first floor. The courtyard is beautiful & our room was placed so that when you sat on out balcony, we were almost completely obscured by the foliage. So it made our balcony very private. However, there were a couple of drawbacks to that foliage that made our balcony so private & romantic..... First, we were woken a couple of times in the middle of the night by late night swimmers giggling as they hid in the foliage, after the pool was supposed to be closed. Also, b/c of the dense foliage stratgically placed around our room & consequently the portion of the lazy river that passed in front of our swim up room, the water in front of our room was very cold!! (It was February though....)So, it was hard to use our 'swim-up' feature that we paid for. However, if we enter the pool @ other areas of the lazy river, that were a little sunnier, the water was nice @ warm... I think it was just b/c our area was so shady & secluded that the sun was never allowed to warm up that section of the pool... Although I am sure that by April, all of the water in the lazy river is warm enough to use.... I'm not complaining... We aren't big swimmers, you just have to realize that if you get one thing, you may have to sacrifice another (seclusion, vs. warm water to dip into off of your balcony....) One thing that should be pointed out is that the rooms were VERY small ~ the pictures on the net make them look bigger than our room actually was. Literally, there was only 3 feet on either side of the bed to walk around. (I could tell b/c the floor was made of one foot saltillo tiles.) And we had a swim up room which is supposed to be bigger than the standard rooms. We did book our room @ the last minute & it was the last room available when we booked, so it is possible that we got the smallest room, but we got the most private, romantic balcony & a great location. Also, the hotel is a bit of a hike to the beach club that the hotel allows you to get into for free ~ Mamitas. So along your hike over to Mamitas, you pass 3 other beach clubs along the way! There hotel /beach club agreement should be with a closer beach club! It makes no sense!! Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I'd definitely stay again...even in the same room.

The co-operation with Mamitas was for me the only down side because this beach is used by several hotels and to have sun beds & umbrella you need to wake up at 7am.

They have 2 beach clubs to choose from and we decided to head out to Mamitas. It is a bit of a walk (about 10 minutes) but we enjoyed walking through town to get there. We got there early to reserve a place in front (probably around 830) and while it was full around 10ish it didn't feel super busy or overly crowded. The breakfast that was included was very nice and they have a wide variety of choices including some vegetarian options which was perfect for me. The staff was very friendly and helped us pick out some good restaurants for dinner and would call to make reservations for us. if you do like to sleep in, I could see how this hotel might be a little noisy. We didn't hear any of the music from the club but that might have been because of where our room was situated. We did hear some noise from the street in the morning but that didn't happen to bother us since we are early risers. I would imagine though that the noise is a lot less than some other hotels who happen to be situated right on 5th ave or closer to it. Overall I was surprised with how developed Playa was but we really had a great time. Our stay at La Tortuga was one of the best we had in Mexico.

They have done a wonderful job of blending everything to keep it cozy and romantic, with that small hotel feel. What a wonderful change from our previous all inclusive nightmare. This hotel was spotless, everything was so clean, and our housekeeper was so sweet. I think that was our favorite part of the hote, the people that work there, everyone, and I do mean everyone give you the best attention, and such wonderful, friendly, service it would be impossible to ever stay in an all inclusive large resort again. The reception desk are so helpful, and very professional. If they recommend a resturant, take there advice, they never steered us wrong.

This is a very touristy, party town with the beaches staying very crowded. La Tortuga Hotel is not \"steps from the beach\" but more like 5 blocks from the beach. Mamitas Beach is a private beach that is available to many hotels for free, which means you need to get there early to get a lounge chair, which are rows and rows and rows of people. We paid extra for the swim-up room. I probably wouldn't have used the pool had it not been right outside my room. The pool area is beautiful with many tropical trees, which means there was mostly shade around the pool. They have a rooftop area for sunbathing, which wasn't too appealing. The hotel staff was great, the complimentary breakfast was wonderful, the room clean. The room was very small, but the reason I am writing this is to warn future travelers about the noise. Recently, a nightclub opened up behind the hotel. We were awakened every night about midnight to the thump, thump, thump of nightclub music. It went on until at least 4 a.m. We complained to the hotel personnel, but they said their hands were tied. No offer of a room rate reduction or anything (we paid $220 per night). They did find me some earplugs, which helped, but I wouldn't spend that much money to have to wear earplugs to bed every night. Too bad, too, because this is a nice place. Oh, the other noise issue was the early morning grounds/pool cleaning crew. They chatted loudly at 7 a.m. When I'm on vacation, I really like to sleep in, but no go here.

We would rate this hotel a 3.5, but that was not an option. Honestly, we were expecting a bit more from the hotel, being that it is the number one rated hotel on TripAdvisor, but that said, we did have a nice stay. My friend has previously stayed at Playa Maya, and she said that she would choose that hotel again over this one, since it is right on the beach and she enjoyed her stay just as much, if not more. We stayed in one of the swim-up rooms, which was nice, but not worth the money in our opinion. We really never used the swim-up feature. The rooms are spacious. The beds are comfortable. The air conditioner was working very well. Actually, we think it was was a bit broken because it was just working so well that we were quite cold on the warmest setting. We were constantly turning it on and off during the night, which was a little bothersome. The bathroom is basic. There were a couple of little bugs in the bathroom, but I think that is sort of to be expected. We had an annoyance with our key cards. Almost every day we had to get them redone so that we could open our door. The setting of La Tortuga is lovely. Very peaceful and relaxing. The pool is not as much functional for swimming as it is pretty, but we still enjoyed going in. The staff collects leaves out of the pool throughout the day, which is nice. The jacuzzi/hot tub is also nice. There aren't many chairs to lounge on poolside, so if you want one, you should probably put your books and towels down early. We read that people love the solarium. It wasn't a draw to us, but some may like it. Having a computer at the bar with free internet access was a plus. The restaurant was pretty good. Breakfast was average. The lunch menu was small, but we ordered salads off the dinner menu and they were very good. We also had the shrimp cocktail, which was good. The staff at the restaurant and bar are very friendly. We especially liked Danny. At reception, Bernardo and Ferdananda were lovely. They were very warm and helpful. The next part, I am copying from another review b/c we felt the same way: \"The beach: Two options --- Mamitas is very crowded and loud but fun party atmosphere. There's another beach option, but sometimes they accept the \"coupons\" you receive from the front desk every AM and sometimes they make you pay. I saw several people arguing with the staff there, although the nice beds with mattresses and more quiet atmosphere was more attractive to me than Mamitas.\" We felt the same as the other reviewer. The quieter beach, Zensi, had great beds/chairs. Some clarity between the hotel and beach club is needed, though, in terms of what La Tortuga guests are entitled to. Everyone seems to have their own opinion. Even the staff at the hotel had different takes on their \"deal\" with this beach club. We found, we either had to pay $5 each for our chairs of consume $15 each in food/beverage, and then the chairs would be free. The food is not good at the beach club and overpriced. I highly suggest you walk down the beach to Playa Maya and eat there. We had a great stay in Playa. We highly recommend the restaurant, Negrosal, for dinner. I had one of the best meals I have ever had.

Make sure you get there early (before 10 am or so) if you want to get a lounge chair near the water. We had the hotel arrange to pick us up and drive us back to the airport.

La Tortuga made our stay in Playa the second week of March. We stayed in the swim up room #111 and then switched to # 302 which had a roof top Jacuzzi. We did not switch rooms because of a problem with the room, but we switched because we wanted to experience two types of rooms. I was surprised by the small size of our swim up room (111). For two people it\u2019s a little tight, but you get used to it quickly because the mattress is worth it. I slept the best I had in four years on this mattress. Oh, how I wished I had that mattress. This room faces the pool since it\u2019s a swim up room, so you may hear some people swimming in the morning, but I\u2019m sure you could list worst things to wake up to. Room 302 with the rooftop Jacuzzi had so much room compared to 111. You have a private stair case up to the rooftop Jacuzzi and seating area. This was so nice I can\u2019t begin to tell you. They provide spa robes, but if you want to be one with nature run up there in your birthday suit if you want. The shower is built for two, no bathtub. This room is extremely quiet. There were a couple of problems with the Jacuzzi, but were fixed immediately. I had made a special request for a birthday and all plans were executed beyond my expectations. Part of the birthday request was a Tres Leches cake (house cake). We liked it so much we wanted more of it two nights later, but they were out of it, but the waiter and chef offered to make a special trip that evening to go out and get another one since that don't make it in house. Twenty minutes later we had two more pieces of that delicious cake. To say they accommodate is an understatement. The complimentary breakfast that everyone writes about here is good, plentiful and filling and will carry you beyond the lunch hour. There\u2019s not one bad pick on the menu for breakfast. I am NOT a coffee drinker, but their coffee was fantastic. So was their Mango/Cranberry juice! By now everyone knows this hotel is not on the beach, but after eating that breakfast everyday you are going to need that 15 minute walk to Mamita's. We only used the Mamita\u2019s beach pass once. It was too crowded for our liking so we turned left on the beach and found a less populated area about five minutes away. No chairs, but more privacy. For even more privacy, we took the colectivo down to Akumal where the beaches are probably like what the Playa beaches were seven years ago. Palm trees for shade and more privacy. The collective is the way to go if you want to visit anywhere south of Playa. No matter what the distance, the cost is $2.20 (22 Pesos) it is so convenient and takes only twenty minutes. A taxi would have cost us $25 for two one way and $30 coming back. The walk from La Tortuga to the colectivo station is 10- 15 minutes, then the walk from the highway where the bus drops you off at Akumal beach is only 10 minutes. Tortuga\u2019s pool area was so lovely to come back to after a day at the beach. There is the slight sound of waterfalls that lull you into a comatose state. The meandering river type pool doesn\u2019t allow you to swim laps, but they do offer a water treadmill that allows you to swim in one place. There are different levels and steps in the pool that if you don\u2019t watch it you can stub your toe. There is also a seating area above the restaurant that you can sit and watch the stars. For the small size of this hotel, they really utilize the space well. Every area of this hotel is smartly utilized and thoughtful. The location is great and away from the noise of 5th ave.

The type of information I could not find easily before I booked. Location: La Tortuga is not on the beach. It is a 5 minute walk to the beach. And the 5 minute walk is to a beach that is not the best in Playa. Mamitas = Bad: La Tortuga has a partnership with a beach club called Mamitas that is on a great beach, but the walk is 10 to 15 minutes...not so easy to do with all your beach gear. Mamitas Beach Club is VERY crowded. Good luck getting a chair or an umbrella unless you want to get there before 9am to claim your spot. Dealing with hordes of people is not something I cam to Mexico for! You can however buy a bed type lounge chair if you buy a $150 bottle of booze! (is this Miami or Mexico?!?!) I had to walk way down the beach to find a spot, away from Mamitas. There were no umbrellas or shade. Not good for 5 hours in the Mexican sun with out shade! I ended up buying my own umbrella and gave up on Mamitas for the rest of my trip. Mamitas is a crowded disco on the beach, just like a club in Miami. Rooms: The rooms in La Tortuga are great, but since it was very booked, we could only get the Superior Junior suite. This was totally over kill since we spent little time in the room. Also, in our Junior Suite, rm 118, the sink, mirror, vanity etc. are NOT private and are part of the general room. If you like your privacy, this room is not so good. Only the toilet and shower are behind a closed door, with no mirror. We switched to s standard room, # 308 wich was a lot cheaper, and we liked it A LOT better. Was simple, had private bathroom, and just made more sense. Overall: This is in no way a bad review, just pointing out some things that are not so great. La Tortuga has amazing service, the friendliest staff and go out of their way to help you. Any problem is fixed immediately. Breakfast which is included, is fantastic. The pool is beautiful. The lounging areas are fantastic But, La Tortuga is more than we needed since we were doing day trips, scuba diving and sight seeing. I felt there was so much to La Tortuga that we did not get full use of like the pool, their bar, pool table, lounging areas.

As others have noted, the neighboring disco music until 5AM was very aggravating. The weather was so beautiful that we wanted to sleep with the windows open. But, that was impossible with the music. Closed windows and turning on the AC is the trick for this. I know they are working on the problem but they should have acknowledged the problem when we booked the room. I didn't see any other rooms with open windows in the early morning. The bed was incredibly hard. However, they did replace it with a nice new bed half way through our stay.

Stayed at this lovely hotel Feb 17 thru 23rd and for two people that like to experience diffferent people, places and things...this place (as well as PDC) makes you want to turn into a repeat visitor again and again! Our last stay at PDC was our first in the \"all-inclusive\" realm (Playacar Palace) and although we had a great time and enjoyed the Palace and the \"mindlessness\" of an all-inclusive [and I mean that in a relaxing nice way :-) ] my heart is with La Toutuga and experiencing local flavors as the way to go. The location, staff and facility was excellent. As repeated on this site over and over - the staff are great. Friendly, communicative and very hard working. I have to tell you, some of them are working 12 plus hour days - and they continue to smile. Believe me, we travel a lot - and the little touches like making efforts to open doors for you going in and out, always saying \"hello\"; \"how was your day?\", smiling while they are sweeping (continually in the awesome pool area!), offering services and to help...all staff members were polite and engaging - but not intrusive. It's can be a fine line - and they draw it here well at La Toutuga. We stayed in Room 116; a superior junior suite. Spacious (sparse for furntiure - maybe one interior room chair in these rooms of great size? Just a small suggestion?). Few steps up to very large open room bath with huge tub/shower you could share with several of your closest friends. Large closet with many shelves/safe etc in this are also. Very adequate for storage. Rear door with private staircase to a rooftop jacuzzi with two large day beds - it was awesome to watch the recent lunar eclipse and stargaze at night! Certainly room in this rooftop for even a small table with chairs then you could eat, sleep and get clean under the sun and stars! Great covered patio with chairs and table and a hammock - we were right next to the restaurant outdoor seating (but enclosed by half wall and plants/solarium staircase etc) and it was still exceptionally quiet (as overall this entire hotel is). The room was immaculate - and kept that way. They have a stocked small refer, not any room to store anything - so we just took out the sodas and water to make room if we needed it (left in the beer so it wouldn't skunk). I realize any hotel doesn't want you stocking your own supply - but how can you pass up liters of Sol beer for 3USD across the street at the OXOX convenience store! They provide extra large bottles of water everyday - so we only bought a few extra for toothbrushing etc. Roof solarium was nice - we snoozed on those big beds too! Umbrellas and drink stands attached and they had no problem bringing drinks or lunch etc to you up there also since other guests took advantage of that. Pool area was wonderful, quiet and serene. Overall, this is certainly an adult hotel (no guests under 16 yrs) and the atmosphere is extremely relaxing. There is a treadmill section of the winding pool so you can swim/exercise against a current, and a six person hot tub in the middle. I'm an Atlantic coaster - so the pool temp was perfect - expecially after being under the hot sun. Loved the tropical plants, huge shade trees, bunches of bananas hanging from the trees, and the birds (hidden in the trees singing). At night...this area was beautifully lit - great views from your room or to walk to and from. Just a lovely atmoshere. Small bar next to a large sitting, reading, lounging area - shaded, very nice. Reasonable prices and guests enjoying happy hour in later afternoon (as we arrived after full days at the beach or day trips). The daily included breakfasts were good, plenty of choices. We had pancakes, omlets, eggs and ham - just ask - they made scrambed eggs upon one request after we got a spanish lesson and exchanged some hand signal descriptions (which is what's wonderful gertting to know people rather than just putting it on your plate from a buffet or impersonal restaurant). The waitstaff was very attentive and overall communicated very well. Believe me, they all speak great english compared to my pretty bad spanish - we both got better; smiles goes a long way. We never got to eat lunch or dinner at the Agora - although it looked good - so many restaurant choices to experience in PDC you need weeks! Just like, too many PDC happy hours in a day too! Rest assured comunication is very easy here in PDC, overall locals are very friendly and helpful. USD for everything - but ATM for pesos if needed (sometimes better on the outskirts of PDC area) is best way to go. For you coffee addicts - the coffee is good here at the hotel - but also go to Java Joe's on 12th (between 5th ave and 10th) the owners are from Jersey, then LA to PDC and very colorful to talk to. We met one morning there before we took off to Akumel for the day - and we started talking after we heard this very fluent spanish speaking (obviously) transplanted American say \"caawfee\" and I smiled to her and said \"hey....now that's spanish I understand!\" She was great to talk too about local stuff and gave you the local low down. Private transport arranged through the hotel via the airport went smooth. Private car that zipped us to and from (and with late arrivals and long days traveling it was worth every penny). They also arranged taxi to pick us up at the hotel and go to Akumel very early one AM - so that was just convenient (with equipment etc) and same price as walking and attempting to flag one for ourselves. Although know (really) taxis are everywhere, especially on 20th or toward Juarez (major roadways running up from beach area). Location was excellent, extremely safe, walkable to everything. XOXO conveinence across the street on 10th, Banamex Bank a block away (ATM), and walking along 10th (toward 20th and beyond) there are also good restaurants (Argentinian, local Mexican) and within that area (known as the Little Italy) toward the beach many other choices - if you want to explore other than the 5th Ave multitude of restaurant choices. Mamitas beach club (voucher for chairs and umbrella are part of your hotel stay) was great, not a far walk at all. Beach was beautiful, long stretch for nice walks. Suggest to just walk down 20 (Constitutients Ave) and go to end, takes a left at the beach and walk to Mamitas along the oceanfront - just another way for variety. Stop at Ah Cacao at the rotary (half way down 20th) - awesome chocolate shakes/brownies/chocolate anything! Mamitas gets crowded - go early (most umbrella taken by 8:30am!) so stake out the few palm trees if needed. (HINT: the cashier comes around near 10:30am (pay up time) so some people abandon the beachchairs anbd umbrellas after they have sunned for a few early morning hours for free...) Mamita's service is okay (can be wandering and slow to find) but...your on vacation remember....so every once in a while it's good to walk yourself to the bar (smirk). Food was pretty decent there (nachos, guac, quesadillas etc). Bartenders were nice guys and certainly provided better service than beach staff. Can't complain much - it's a beach bar! La Tortuga - for it's amenites included, staff, location, price and overall accomodations it's an excellent value and choice.

I don't like going up to staff and interrupt a game so I just didn't play (and they charged you for playing!). I know it's not all-inclusive but pool should be free. I did like the bookshelf with books people left behind, I found a great Swedish book, that I put back when I was finished and my husband put the two books he had red during the holiday. We had booked a suite for the first night and everything was perfect in the room (we got the honeymoon package with sparkling wine, fruit and cheese). After that we stayed in a swim up room, I think we got the smallest one and we still got to pay the same amount as the people in the other swim up rooms (I presume), which is a bit unfair considering our room and balcony bit was half the size of everyone else (apart from our neighbours). The last night we had a standard plus room, which was very strange on two levels with two beds, no balcony - just strange. Make sure you don't stay in 214 unless you have kids with you (then it would be perfect). I love that you can have your breakfast whenever you wake up. And the fruit cocktails when you arrive.

Had one king bed and the room was no bigger than the bed, no kidding. My husband and I couldn't even get past each other to walk in front of the bed. It was not a big deal - but if we could have gotten a larger room for just 31 bucks per night, we would have. I think I was a little annoyed reading previous notes on tripadvisor of constant upgrades at no cost. Nothing at all was offered, and when we inquired about a larger room for any night of the 5, they told us it would be an additional 31 bucks. Second, Mamitas was overcrowded, too public and the chairs were so uncomfortable. The walk was fine, it was a lousy beach club with lousy food. We paid each day 10 bucks to another nicer beach club which included padded chairs, an umbrella (or two if we wanted) and most important, clean bathrooms. Mamitas bathrooms were disgusting, people were changing in there constantly, so they were soaking wet. If we had not found another beach club to our liking, the vacation wouldn't have been as good. As it states on Tripadvisor, the hotel is exactly the way it seems, only a few lounge chairs, a tiny sun deck with no breeze obviously as this was not on the ocean/beach.

We stayed at the La Tortuga hotel 9 nights from December 15-24, 2007. This is a first class hotel that has earned and deserves the #1 rating on Trip Advisor. With all that La Tortuga has to offer, what really makes La Tortuga an outstanding hotel are the people. Every single person at the hotel is friendly, attentive and dedicated to guests. At the front desk, Anne Marie was always smiling and greeted us by name every time we came in or out of the hotel. She made suggestions for dining, trips, etc. Everyone greets and watches each guest to make sure everything is perfect for your whole trip. Alfredo the bell captain is a charmer. He is always laughing and joking and made us smile every day we were there. He interacts with all guests. Our dining servers added to the experience. With servers Daniel, Jose, Pablo, Luis, Micky and Santiago, we felt like we were with a group of close friends in their home. Dan now knows a new word \u2013 tocayo, which means a person with the same name \u2013 he learned it from his tocayo, Daniel. Dan also learned a few Mayan phrases from Santiago and others. At the bar, Fernando, Victor and Armando took great care of us. We learned several new Spanish expressions and how to make some of the specialty drinks at the bar. Overall, this is a world-class hotel delivering an exceptional experience for their guests. LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION. The hotel is just a few steps away from 5th Avenue with all its action. The street buzzes during almost all hours of the day and night. You can shop, sit and sip a drink, watch the crowds go by, enjoy the breezes off the Caribbean or participate in active bargaining with the local vendors. It is also just a few short blocks from the shores of the Caribbean. ARRIVAL. Arrival at La Tortuga was a joy. Anne Marie at the reception desk welcomed us and quickly checked us in. Everyone in our party was presented a free welcome drink in the reception area. We arrived a little earlier than expected. We had booked 4 standard rooms for 9 nights. We discovered first-hand why La Tortuga is rated #1 by guests on Trip Advisor. We also learned that they are not sitting back happy just to be the best \u2013 they are continually improving their property (more on this later). Our standard rooms had just been repainted and Anne Marie was concerned about the fumes, so she immediately offered us upgraded rooms for our first night at no additional cost. We were given 4 junior suites \u2013 one a superior junior suite. Our rooms on the first night were 101, 304, 305 and 306. There is more on the rooms in a section below. GARDENS & GROUNDS. The hotel property and grounds are more beautiful in person than they are in the photos. The hotel property is shady with numerous cozy sitting and lounging areas. It is serene, quiet and peaceful. The grounds are immaculate and the tropical gardens are meticulously maintained. TIP: Find the solarium patio. It is an open air public patio just above the bar. You\u2019ll find padded lounge beds with drink trays and tables and chairs. It is wonderful at night. They will serve your drinks and meals in this area if you ask. HOT TUB & POOL. There is a hot tub large enough for about 8 people. The hot tub is surrounded by a unique swimming pool. The water in the pool was ambient temperature. It was refreshing during the hot afternoon, but a little chilly in the early morning and in the evening. We enjoyed the hot tub in the cooler evenings and the pool when we needed a refreshing dip. BAR AREA. Every hour at La Tortuga was a happy hour. The official happy hour at the bar is from 5-6 PM with 2-1 drinks. Our buddies at the bar \u2013 Fernando, Victor and Armando stretched that hour beyond its limits several times and kept our drinks flowing at happy prices. We learned about several local specialty drinks including the Yucatan. They also carefully followed our instructions when we asked for a drink to be prepared in our customary way. There is free internet access at the bar. The maximum time per guest is 30 minutes so the computer is always accessible, sometimes with a short wait. Other guests were always considerate when someone was waiting \u2013 I think the friendly spirit at La Tortuga rubs off on everyone. There is a pool table that costs 5 pesos (50 cents) per game. The charge is a great idea because it is inexpensive, but you can usually get a game in without waiting or after a short wait. AGORA RESTAURANT. La Tortuga isn\u2019t sitting back now that they have achieved the #1 rating on Trip Advisor. They are making systematic, continual improvements to the rooms and the hotel. They have just completed a full remodel of the Agora restaurant. The remodel project was completed during the last few days of our stay. The newly refurbished Agora now features new tile flooring, a new bar/serving area, new ceilings and new d\u00e9cor. They were nearing completion of the new front enclosure and full AC system for the restaurant when we left. BREAKFAST INCLUDED. Free full breakfast is included with all rooms at La Tortuga. The free breakfast includes the breakfast entr\u00e9e, juice and coffee or tea. If you order a soft drink or extras, there is a small added charge. There are multiple breakfast options including huevos rancheros, omelets, fresh fruits & breads, yogurt, baguette sandwiches, quesadillas, cheese plate, eggs any style and specialty dishes. The specialty dishes we tried were sincronizadas (ham & cheese quesadillas with beans & guacamole), motule\u00f1os (2 eggs sunny side up on corn tortillas with black beans, tomato salsa, ham, cheese, potatoes and fried platanos), chilaquiles (fried tortillas topped with tomato salsa, eggs, beans, onions and potatoes) and tasty and the servers again were warm, friendly and personal in the way they treated us. The coffee is perfect \u2013 strong without any bitterness. There are also a variety of fresh and flavorful juices. DINNER. We also ate dinner several times in the newly refinished Agora restaurant. They gave us a 20% discount for every dinner and the food is delicious. The 20% discount is not available during the high winter season at the Agora. The favorite entrees for our group were the pasta Carbonara and the Chicken Cordon Bleu (mmmmmm\u2026.). SERVERS. Our servers at La Tortuga made breakfast an experience. We felt like we were with a group of close friend in their home. Our servers were Daniel, Jose, Pablo, Luis, Micky and Santiago. ROOMS. There are 51 rooms at La Tortuga. Our group of 4 couples stayed in 11 different rooms during our 9 nights. We were happy with all rooms and only changed rooms because Anne Marie and Laura graciously offered upgrades at no additional cost. It was also nice because we are travel agents and we were able to see more of the rooms at the property. On the first night, Anne Marie upgraded us to 4 junior suites at no charge because our standard rooms had just been painted. She was concerned that the fumes would bother us. We spent the 2nd night in our standard rooms. For nights 3-7, Laura generously upgraded us to the other available rooms at no extra cost. We had 4 rooms for 9 nights \u2013 a total of 36 \u201croom nights\u201d. These are the rooms we were in: 101 - Superior Junior suite (8 nights) 219 - Superior Junior suite (7 nights) 201 - Junior suite (7 nights) 303 - Standard Plus (7 nights) 304 \u2013 Junior suite (1 night) 305 \u2013 Junior suite (1 night) 306 \u2013 Junior suite (1 night) 22 - Standard room with small balcony (1 night) 23 - Standard room with small balcony (1 night) 24 - Standard room with small balcony (1 night) 25 - Standard room with small balcony (1night) All rooms at La Tortuga are wonderful. Every room comes with AC, TV, telephone, alarm clock, ceiling fan, mini bar, in-room safe, coffee machine and hair dryer. Most TVs have now been upgraded to flat screen. We watched a little TV during downtimes (and while waiting for significant others to make themselves adorable before leaving the room). We didn\u2019t count the channels, but there are quite a few channels available in both English and Spanish. Spanish stations are generally dubbed in English or have English subtitles. The safes are about the size of a toaster oven \u2013 large enough for wallets, cameras, jewelry, small purses, etc. Laptops and larger video cameras will not fit in the safes. There is no deposit for the safe key, but there is a charge if you lose the key. DISCO NOISE. We have read online complaints about disco noise at La Tortuga at night. When we tried really hard from our deck or with our windows open, we could hear the disco music. Our group of 8 stayed in 10 different rooms at La Tortuga and the disco music didn\u2019t interfere with anyone\u2019s sleep on any night of our stay. Even the most sound-sensitive sleeper would need is a cheap pair of foam ear plugs at night. If you are worried, bring the ear plugs \u2013 everything else makes this hotel worth the stay! STANDARD ROOM. There are 12 standard rooms at La Tortuga. Of those, 4 include a small balcony with a table and 2 chairs. Our group spent 1 night in the 4 standard rooms 22, 23, 24 and 25. These rooms are very nice. All four rooms had very small private balconies. The balcony in room 25 had the nicest view of the grounds. Room 22 had both a queen bed and a single bed. There is a small private patio area with table and chairs serving just these 4 rooms. Our group of 8 enjoyed our \u201cprivate spot\u201d for the 1 night we stayed in these rooms. All these rooms had queen size beds. Three had new flat panel TVs. All included the standard amenities listed above. We had plenty of closet space and drawer space for our 9-night stay. We have read some reviews on Trip Advisor with complaints about lack of space in the rooms at La Tortuga, but we do not share that opinion. All rooms we stayed in, including these standard rooms were very comfortable, recently refurbished and well-worth the low standard room price. The standard rooms are a wonderful option if you are on a tight travel budget and still want to experience the #1 hotel in Playa del Carmen. You\u2019ll still enjoy this prime location, the outstanding service and enjoy most of the same amenities STANDARD ROOM PLUS. There are 22 rooms in this category. These rooms are larger than the standard rooms and offer better balcony options. One couple in our group spent 7 nights in room 303 which is in this category. The room is larger than a standard room and has a very nice balcony with a great view. SWIM UP ROOMS. There are 5 swim up rooms at La Tortuga. These rooms are the same size as the standard plus rooms. They are on the ground floor and have direct access to the pool from the balcony. We did not stay in one of these rooms, but they looked like fun. JUNIOR SUITE. There are 10 unique junior suites. All include a VERY LARGE Jacuzzi tub, a private terrace or deck, bathrobe and slippers. Some Jacuzzis are in a private roof-top terrace and others are in the room, in the bathroom or on the balcony. Our group spent a total of 10 nights in 4 different rooms in this category \u2013 rooms 201, 304, 305 and 306. These suites are spacious and luxurious. If you want to enjoy a private Jacuzzi for 2 under the stars, ask for one of the junior suites on the third floor. SUPERIOR JUNIOR SUITE. There are unique 7 superior suites. All include the VERY LARGE Jacuzzi tub and INCREDIBLY COMFORTABLE Spring Air King beds. Other options include a small private pool, a private balcony, a private lounge mattress or hammock or an in-room sofa. We can safely say that \u201cYES! There is a SOFT, LUXURIOUS bed in Mexico. If you love a top-end bed, this is the room you want. Guests in this category can choose to have their free breakfast served right in their room. You can also choose to have dinner service provided in these rooms. Our group spent 15 nights in 2 rooms in this category \u2013 101 and 219. Suite 101 is ground-level, includes an in-room Jacuzzi with an access door from the Jacuzzi to the private pool and the wonderfully comfortable king bed. Suite 219 is on the 2nd level, has the in-room Jacuzzi a sofa in the room and a large private balcony with a table and 2 chairs looking down onto the beautiful interior patio and grounds. If you want to splurge at the #1 hotel in Playa del Carmen, reserve the superior junior suite. You will be amazed with the incredibly comfortable king bed and other amenities in these amazing rooms. OTHER HOTELS IN PLAYA. We have previously stayed in Playa del Carmen at the Shangri La hotel, another top-rated hotel on Trip Advisor. We loved that hotel and location on the beach, but their service is well-below the service we received at La Tortuga. We booked this trip 10 months in advance. We had originally planned to stay at Luna Blue Hotel & Garden, which at the time carried a higher Trip Advisor rating than La Tortuga. We read a few snippety comments from the Luna Blue management on Trip Advisor which concerned us. Luna Blue also started their holiday season rates earlier than La Tortuga. We were actually able to book La Tortuga for about the same price as that offered by Luna Blue. On this trip, we took a walk to Luna Blue and looked around the gardens and hotel. From our observations, La Tortuga is in a category well-above Luna Blue. If you are comparing these hotels, or any other hotel in Playa del Carmen, do yourself a favor and run to La Tortuga. If you book anywhere else, you are doing yourself a disservice. 5th AVENUE & THE BEACH. La Tortuga is a just a few blocks from the beach and a short block off Quinta Avenida. At anytime of the day, you can get your favorite drink at a bar or restaurant, buy a snack or a beer for about a buck at a store, have a patio or restaurant dining experience or shop for an endless variety of artwork and souvenirs. This is where the action is. You can shop, sit and sip a drink, watch the crowds go by, enjoy the breezes off the Caribbean or participate in some dickering with the local vendors. Many restaurants offer 2-1 margaritas and $1 beer to attract patrons. Playa del Carmen is the perfect size for us. It is big enough to offer fun, varied activities, shopping and great restaurants. It is small enough that it still has an authentic local feel. TIP: Get up early and see the Caribbean sunrise. The view is incredible! PIZZA. The best place to grab pizza almost anytime: Express Mandarina\u2019s which is only about 100 yards from La Tortuga. Head to 5th Avenue, hang a left going north and you\u2019ll spot them on your right (beach side of the street) right in the dip in the road. For 50 pesos (5 bucks) you get 2 huge slices of pizza and a beer or soft drink. SEAFOOD. The best place for seafood: The Blue Lobster which is just a few hundred yards from La Tortuga on the corner of 5th Avenue and Calle 12. Our favorites were the shrimp. We loved the coconut shrimp, garlic shrimp and shrimp appetizer. The portions are very large, the lobster and shrimp are exquisite and the prices are good. They also serve a huge refreshing jumbo iced tea if you have had too much tequila. And they have really cool Blue Lobster t-shirts for $12. MARGARITAS. The best sidewalk deal for margaritas and/or a meal. Karen\u2019s Caf\u00e9 on 5th Avenue between 2nd and 4th north on the west side of 5th Avenue. You can get 2-1 margaritas almost ALL the time. If they take longer than expected, they throw in more free margaritas. Be careful here! We had to stagger back to our rooms after a lunch with all the margaritas. Their arrachero beef tacos are great. They also have wonderful live Peruvian music. CANCUN AIRPORT. On December 15, 2007 we arrived at the Cancun airport at 3:30 PM. The immigration counters and waiting area have been updated since our last trip in 2006. There are now restrooms easily accessible in the waiting area. There were 8 active counters when we arrived. It took us about 30 minutes to get through immigration. The wait for our luggage was quite long. There were 4 flights which arrived at about the same time. The luggage for all 4 flights was placed on the same conveyer while at least 2 other conveyers sat unused. Our luggage didn\u2019t make it to us until about 1 hour after we landed. Once we had our luggage, we quickly cleared customs and made our way through the time-share vendors to the outside of the airport. Our flight out on December 24 was uneventful \u2013 we just didn\u2019t want to go! GROUND TRANSPORTATION. We reserved our airport transfers online at www.entertainment-plus.net/tour_transport.cfm with USA Transfers. This was the best price we found for our group of 8 for round-trip to Playa del Carmen. The cost was $115 round-trip for all of us. We paid cash $85 US to the driver at the Cancun airport and the $30 US balance to the driver on the return trip. We also tipped each driver $15-20 each trip for their help with our 12+ bags. The USA Transfer service is excellent. Everything worked for us exactly as promised. Brant Boston sent us a separate confirmation email for each leg of the transfer with very clear instructions. He also sent us a reminder email 2 days before we left home confirming the dates of arrival, flight information and hotel information. Their driver met us outside the airport with a large sign clearly displaying our name. It was a quick, efficient and professional routine at the airport. If you have ever had ground transportation hassles at the airport, you know how much that peace of mind is worth. We highly recommend USA Transfers for transportation between the Cancun airport and the Riviera Maya locations. USA Transfers offers private tours and transportation around the Riviera Maya locations. Their prices are most competitive if you are based in Cancun. TIP: Stash some US currency in your wallet or suitcase for use on the return trip. You\u2019ll do well using your ATM card to get pesos for expenses while travelling in Mexico, but you\u2019ll want some US dollars for the return trip. USA Transfers accepts pesos, but their price is best with US dollars. Also, you\u2019ll want some US dollars for the return flight, airport purchases in the US and parking fees/tips on your return trip. TIP: Carry your hotel address and phone number with you when your fly out. It will help assure that the driver knows exactly where you are staying. Many hotels have similar names in the Maya Riviera. Even with the longer than expected wait for our luggage, we were out of the Cancun airport in about 90 minutes. Our USA Transfer driver took us to our hotel quickly and safely. The trip from the Cancun airport to Hotel La Tortuga in Playa del Carmen was about 45 minutes. PRIVATE VAN & TOUR. The best deal we found for our day trips to Chitzen Itza, Ek Balam, Tulum and Coba was through Playa.Info located right in Playa del Carmen. We paid about $300 per trip plus tip for van and driver Raez for 2 - 12 hour per day trips the Mayan sites. We didn\u2019t count the seats \u2013 we think it was a 15 passenger van, but it had plenty of room for our group of 8. The van was brand new and very comfortable. Raez was prompt, safe, spoke English well and very informative. He even accompanied us on our bike tour of the Coba ruins.

La Tortuga Our first night was fantastic. We arrived after a long flight and then the drive from Cancun. Apon arrival, they immediately brought us delicious fruit drinks to welcome us. The small, friendly atmosphere was very inviting and relaxing. Before heading to our rooms, we enjoyed a few minutes out by the pool-which didnt have another soul in or near it. They brought us drink menus and made us feel very welcome. Since we had arrived hours earlier than was originally planned, the hotel was not quite ready with our rooms. Instead, they upgraded us to junior suites for the night. Room 304 My husbands and my room was very comfortable. We had a king size bed, flat screen TV, refrigerator, personal safe, AC, ceiling fan, and a beautiful bathroom with double sinks and very large shower. To top all of that off, we had a rooftop jacuzzi. Our cute little balcony had a spiral staircase up to the private area on the roof with two couches and a large jacuzzi. As hard as we tried (climbing on the couches, looking over walls) we were not able to see any other private areas on the roof. The jacuzzi did take a while to fill up, but that just gave us more time to enjoy the beautiful view of a church steeple and the people below-dont worry, they can't see you. Except for the bar and resteraunt, we were able to stay out in the pool or hot tub as long as we liked. During the entire trip, I felt like we had the place all to ourselves. With it being such a small hotel, there were not many guests which made our stall all the more peaceful. Room 23 The next night we were moved from our upgraded suite to our standard room. The staff was very helpful in moving our luggage (as they were the first night) to the new room. The standard room was smaller and obviously didnt include the rooftop jacuzzi, but still very cozy. We had a nice full size bed, refrigerator, personal safe, AC, and ceiling fan. Our standard room did have a balcony, but was overgrown and did'nt provide much of a view. Room 101 The next day, we were informed that due to the construction below us (they were expanding their resteraunt) they were upgrading us again to suites for the remainder of our stay. I was surprised by the move since I had not even noticed the construction. Our new room was very nice, much like the first suite we had, but it was ground level. Instead of the rooftop jacuzzi, we had our own private swimming pool. We did have a jacuzzi in our bathroom that also worked as our shower. This room also came with all the amenities as the others. Our air conditioning in the room was not cooperating (although it could have been the user...) but the staff was very helpful and very prompt in solving our problem. The Resteraunt The restraunt was wonderful. We were served a free breakfast every morning, which included one plate, one juice, and one coffee. I personally preferred their pancakes to the many breakfast options. It included 3 cakes, a whole bananna, one strawberry, and one grape. My husband preferred the quesadillas. For Dinner I had their Chicken Cordon Bleu. I would recommend this plate to anyone and everyone. It was by far the most delicous Cordon Bleu I have ever had. The staff was amazing. They were there whenever you needed them, the majority of them spoke English very well, and were very professional. The Bar Even though it was a small bar, they were very capable of making any kind of drink you requested. I tried their mojitto, Long Island Iced tea, Taquilla sunrise, and strawberry daiquiri. My personal favorite was the Daiquiri. The area La tortuga was conviently located near \"5th Ave.\" This Ave is just for walking-no cars allowed. It has every kind of shopping you could need, even groceries. If you're looking for souveniers, the best place for prices are the larger stores. The only problem is that you're not able to bargain with the sellers. The small shops really want to sell you their products so their always willing to lower their prices to make a deal with you. La Tortuga is also close to the beach. If you want to lounge on chairs, you have to get a pass from the hotel and go to Mamitas which is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. If all you want to do is walk along the beach or go swimming, you can head to any beach around. All in all, my stay at La Tortuga was a excellent experience. I would recommend this hotel to anyone in the Playa Del Carmen area and would return in a heart beat. I would like to thank La Tortuga staff for making my stay a wonderful experience.", "Date": "December 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cEncore Performance by La Tortuga and Staff\u201d", "Author": "Austin_Tvlr", "ReviewID": "UR11703673", "Content": "The bottom line at this hotel is whatever you need (or want), they will do their very best to accommodate.

Jessica and Anna, as always, were great about responding to emails or phone calls and arranged for airport transportation, a fishing trip, a golf outing, and spa appointments weeks prior to our arrival.

We had an A/C unit go out in our room after our first night and were complimentary upgraded to one of their best suites for our remaining three nights.

Tripadvisor listed La Tortuga as one of the 5 most highly rated and the comments listed made it seem like the right match for us. The hotel was outstanding, 31 rooms tucked around an amazing 'lobby' comprised of palm trees and a winding pool river with small bridges and lounges. The service was some of the best we have ever encountered- everyone was friendly, responsive and seemed to be enjoying themselves making other people happy. I think ours was the best room, 101, a junior suite with our own pool and private garden with a large chaise and private cocktail table and 2 chairs. The included breakfast was offered from a menu of delightful choices which ranged from typical Mexican to fruit plates to pancakes, great assortment of juices- mango/cranberry was my favorite. We ate dinner twice at the hotel, the food was excellent and again a nice range of choices. La Tortuga is on 10 avenue, surrounded by shops and hundreds of restaurants within a block or two. Felt very safe- no issues walking around at night. Two blocks down is the infamous 5th avenue, blocked off from cars and a stroll at any time of day or night will result in offers for tours to cuban cigars to gold jewelry. Definately for the tourists, tons of bars and night life, fun to see, felt like a carnival. The hotel belongs to a beach club which provides 2 lounge chairs and a thatched unbrella. The beach it self is breath taking- the sand is from ground up coral so it is not hot to walk on and the water is perfect temperature and crystal clear. No snorkeling- have to take the ferry to Cozumel for that, which is a great day trip. If you plan on the beach go early, it tends to get crowded as the day progresses. There are also free beaches near where the ferry comes in. It is all the same water. No problem with the water or ice, they use filtered, so did not even worry about brushing my teeth. Fell in love with Margarettas, ( with no sugar!!) and the bar tenders quickly remember what you drink and how you like it. Met lots of friendly people, from all over the world: Holland, Canada, Korea and of course the US. There were families, honey moon couples, single folks, nice variety and it was fun to see folks in the morning, and then around the pool in the pm to share adventures. You do not need a car- transportation is easy from Cancun airport- there is a shuttle for $24 a person or a private cab for 4 is $82, but with limited baggage space. It is easy to rent a vechicle for a day to venture out to the Mayan ruins , cenotes, snorkeling, etc. which is what we did. Driving was certainly an adventure- there a lots of small and large excursions to take if you don't want to drive. The hotel can make any arrangement s for you. If you go to La Tortuga look forward to the towels each day. I recommended the hotel to my girlfriend for her honeymoon and she is going.

Let me tell you, it was a wonderful experience! The rooms themselves were not spectacularly appointed or super large, but it's probably the grounds themselves (they are beautifully kept and landscaped) and the absolute friendliness and personalties of the staff that make this boutique hotel so wonderful and charming. I'm not one for all-inclusives, and when I travel for pleasure, I'd rather have something unique with personality, rather than the typical large chain hotel. So if you are expecting the amenities and rooms that you may find at a Westin, for example, this is probably not the place for you. But if you like charming, unique properties with their own personality, you must stay at La Tortuga! First of all, all of the hotel rooms are on the exterior of the property, and surround a large, lushly landscaped courtyard with a pool, swimming lanes, and outside dining and a bar. We booked a swim up room, and off our little balcony on the first floor, we could enter the pool and get to any of the little areas. They are absolutely meticulous at caring for their landscaping; every morning the gardeners were skimming the pool areas for stray leaves and such. The grounds are beautiful and romantic in the evening, lit up with candles and torches and Christmas lights. We enjoyed several evenings having a cocktail while sitting on the comfortable couch seating around the grounds. The staff is phenomenal; they greet you with a smile and a salutation every time they see you; you really feel that they appreciate you as a client. After visiting several other areas in Cancun and Isla Mujeres, I felt that the service at this hotel was exceptional and genuine; as I did not get they same level of service at other places. The wait staff will come and talk to you if they have a free moment, and it was fun practicing my Spanish skills with the waiters and bartenders as they practiced their English skills with me. And the hotel concierges were extremely helpful with information and guidance. Playa itself is wonderful; not too much of a party town, like Cancun, but more laid back and classier. Cancun reminds me of a cheap Vegas hotel strip; Playa seems like an upscale European town. They have a great selection of restaurants and bars to choose from. One hint: from the ocean to tenth street is the plaza area, really aimed at tourists; wander outside of this area and it's not as pretty and a little more rougher. I really did not feel that we were that far from Mamita's beach club; it is somewhat of a walk, but we actually enjoyed the exercise getting to the beach. We never had a problem getting chairs at Mamita's either. One problem which is unfortunately not La Tortuga's fault: there is a disco a couple of blocks away that is open until 5am every night, and when it starts to get quiet at the hotel after midnight, you can hear the pounding music as if it's right in the hotel. This led to many sleepless nights. However, I can't say that it would be much different at other places, as many of the other guests commented on having this same experience at other hotels both in Playa and in other cities in Mexico. Quite honestly, as I'm on vacation, this would not stop me from staying at La Tortuga again; I loved this place so much!", "Date": "December 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNo Hotel like La Tortuga\u201d", "Author": "donross", "ReviewID": "UR11529976", "Content": "At last I have experienced this wonderful hotel recommended by so many travellers to PDC.

I am handicapped and walk with a cane and every time I went up or down there was always someone there to offer help or just to watch over me. Next day I was transferred to a swim up room on the first floor with a lovely terrace and steps into the beautiful pool. I made good use of the terrace with lots of room service, always served with one of those great smiles. There are two dining areas; one in front, open to 10th Ave., and a beautiful outdoor area beside the pool. Lovely in the daytime but especially at night when the pool lights are on and lights in the trees. The food is good and especially the breakfasts which are included in the room rate. This is no Holiday Inn but a very special hotel hotel with a very special staff.

Everything met our expectations. This is such a nice place, one block off of Quinta Ave. Upon arriving we were greeted by a friendly staff and a beautiful tropical drink. Our room was everything we needed a comfortable bed, a/c and a mini bar. We have been to the Cancun/Playa area numerous times and have stayed at the mega resorts and small boutique places and this one is simply the best. We were pleasantly surprised by the breakfast, it is not just a continental one, a full meal with a lot of variety. Also happy hour can not be beat, 1pm-11pm 2x1 drinks. The Mamitas beach club is also a plus. The only minus is its a pretty long walk in the heat from the hotel. The only negative I can think of is parking, the hotel does not have a lot so its street parking only. As for Playa itself its still a beautiful place to visit and central to many other Riviera Maya attractions. We drove one day to Coba to see the ruins, about an hour plus drive. We also went to Cozumel which is just a ferry ride away, we definately recommend the Chankanaub park for snorkeling and swimming with Dolphins. We had great meals throughout the week but we definately would say to stay far away from Las Mananitas on 5th, that place was awful, the food was so bland and portions tiny. One of the musts is La Pesca, this is not in the touristy area, its up on 30th right across the street from the Mega Store. Very good prices and very good seafood. We also got lucky because we got to catch part of the jazz festival at Mamitas. Since we are from the SF Bay Area we were suprised to find Tower of Power out there.

We were staying in Playa for one week for my son's wedding. After reading many reviews on Tripadvisor, there was no question that this hotel would be perfect. I was correct. It was booked through the hotel's website and I exchanged emails with Anna and Jessica. They were always answered promptly and with all the information that was required. It was a pleasure working with them. From the moment that we arrived at the hotel, we were treated as if we were special. A cab that we took from Cancun left us in front of La Tortuga. Immediately, a man came and greeted us on the sidewalk and took our bags. He accompanied us to the front desk for check-in where we were immediately seated and were given a fruit drink while we completed the process. This took less than five minutes. We were given a key to the safe in our room which was much appreciated. The bell man accompanied us to our room with our bags and welcomed us to La Tortuga. He couldn't have been nicer. We had a superior junior suite room #117 and it was lovely. The pool was about four feet from our patio. We made great use of the patio with its chairs and table. It was not very far from the hotel's Agora restaurant and beyond that, the bar. The room itself was immaculate and had a large bedroom with a mini refrigerator that the hotel kept stocked with beer, soda, and water. We found this very convenient. It also had a large bathroom/dressing room with a good sized closet. Another wonderful feature was the private rooftop jacuzzi with a bed and wonderful sunshine. It was decorated with lush tropical plants. This was just wonderful. When my son, the groom came to visit us, he couldn't believe how spacious and unique our accommodations were. The bedroom was a nice size and each evening there was an animal sculpture on the bed. We even had the royal treatment with the flower petals a few times. The king size bed was very comfortable. Now on to the staff at the hotel- they could not do enough for us. From check-in with Lusero to the waiters in the open air dining room who were Santiago, Daniel and Alfredo they were all so pleasant and helpful remembering our names and always asking how we were doing. I can't say enough about the staff, they are just a group of great people with a common mission to make those who stay at this hotel very comfortable. We had a delicious dinner for eight at the Agora restaurant on our first night at the hotel. My family raved about the food and the excellent service. Breakfast every morning was enjoyable. We ordered from the hotel menu and everything was just fine. There was something for everyone, pancakes, bacon, omelets, cheese and fruit, eggs, cereal and many Mexican dishes. This was all included in the room rate, a real bargain. Also, if you're up early like my sister, they brought her coffee right to a lounge area where she was seated. She didn't have to ask. They came over to her and asked if she would like some coffee. All served so beautifully with doilies under the teacup on the saucer. The hotel itself is a beautiful oasis away from the bustling crowds on Fifth Avenue. It is peaceful and the pool with all the tropical trees and plants is just wonderful. It is constantly being cleaned and it is so nice to come home to after a hectic day. We went to the beach by my son's hotel on 8th street because everyone always met there. There were sixty guests at this wedding and they came from all over. So we were busy every day. La Tortuga was a respite from all the excitement and I tried to make it a mini vacation for my husband and myself. I succeeded. When it came time to leave, Santiago and Daniel came to our room and took our bags to the waiting taxi. How's that for service! In closing, I would like to thank the entire staff at this hotel from the woman who kept our room so clean to the bartenders and waiters, busboys, greeters and all the people behind the scene who made our stay here so enjoyable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a truly relaxing and over the top vacation.

I had read reviews and was hoping for that very room. We arrived to find an anniversary surprise waiting for us in the room. Thank you Anna and Jessica! Ivan showed us all the amenities that the room had to offer. We had a self serve mini bar in the room and a rooftop jacuzzi. The tub was gorgeous and huge and halfway enclosed with clear glass. The showerhead was adjustable and the double sinks were very modern. The closet was huge and we got good use from the complimentary safe. There was more than enough space for all of our belongings, and I tend to overpack. Our suite was very clean and smelled nice. The bed was fluffy and I actually slept sounder than I ever have at any hotel. The fact that they don't allow kids under 16 is also a plus. It was nice to have some peace and quiet for a change. The room had a plasma tv and american news channels, which was nice to watch on our down time. The room rate includes a la carte breakfast from the menu at their restaurant Agora.

We had dinner there once and the food as always was very good. The waiters were always friendly and ready to answer any questions. We had lots of fun with the restaurant staff. We also enjoyed the bar and the outstanding mojitos. Oh and the pina colada was the creamiest I've ever tasted. We enjoyed the pool both day and night. It was always being maintained by the grounds staff. Everything was always immaculate. The banana trees and the tropical palms surrounding the pool made it feel like an oasis. There were areas with shade and areas with sun. There were more than enough lounge chairs to go around. We had fun swimming through the lazy rivers and under the bridges too. The tropical jazz or spa like music playing in the background is really relaxing. I swear we never heard anything other than birds and and the waterfalls from the pool. I especially enjoyed the multi levels of the pool. The pool was heaven, seriously! We never had a chance to visit the spa but we did use our complientary beach passes to Mamita's Beach Club. The hotel even gave us towels every day which was a plus. The beach club was nice. We got here after 12 noon most of the time and found two or three palapas available with chairs. From what I read, they are hard to come by. Also September may be a slower season, don't know. We shopped up and down 5th. We ate fajitas at \"La Parilla\" which I recomend. We also dined at \"La Adela\" which was stupendous. The Margarita I had there was the best I've ever had. We also tried the famous \"HC del Monterrey\" and had the best steak ever.

In all honesty, this was one of the best hotels that my husband and I have ever stayed at, especially with cost-value considerations. We highly recommend spending the extra per night rate to get a swim up room, you won't be disappointed. On their website, they have an early booking discount, which is an added bonus! The breakfast is delicious, a la carte, and included in your room rate. No silly meat and cheese buffet, but good Mexican food options and other more standard ham, egg, cheese croissants, too. And, if you like to sleep in, there's no stopping time for breakfast to be served, so no worries. Whenever I book a hotel, I'm very keen on the location, to make sure that it's convenient to get anywhere that we'd like. La Tortuga did not disappoint here either, as the location was perfect to the main shopping/restaurant/bar street in Playa, and very close to the beach. The Mamitas Beach Club, where you will have a free lounge chair as a part of your hotel rate, is a bit of a walk from the hotel (about 15 minutes), but a very nice location. We spent two of our four afternoons here. It was a very nice feature as well, that they did not allow children at the hotel. For those of you that need to get away from the family resorts, this is your place. If you prefer five pre-set all-inclusive buffet restaurants with the same food everyday and kids running around with employees bugging you to join in on pool games, with loud music and whistles, etc. - then don't stay here! We also used the spa for a few services, including massages. The massages were incredible. Highly recommended! I have already recommended La Tortuga to many friends, and if we find ourselves planning another trip to Playa, we'll certainly stay here again. In fact, we may travel to Playa just because of the hotel!

Seriously\u201d", "Author": "Louise_Parker", "ReviewID": "UR8548679", "Content": "First of all, Playa is a lovely place to stay. It\u2019s clean, safe, low-rise and leafy. The hotel is in an excellent location, within one block of 5th Avenue (Avenida Quintos, where all the restaurants, shops and bars are) so near enough to be convenient in the evenings but far enough to be quiet. There are also restaurants on 10th avenue where the hotel is located, there is a launderette with 24 hour service nearby, and the dive shop we used is a few blocks away on 10th. The hotel is lovely. From the minute we arrived and were given a welcoming drink, to the towel art on the bed every day when we got in, every detail is taken care of. Staff are friendly and efficient, they learn your names and use them. The rooms are not large but they are clean and comfortable, equipped with AC, a dehumidifier (it was very humid in August), a ceiling fan that we used a lot more than the AC, fridge and room safe. The bed was huge and lovely. The bathrooms are fairly basic, ie. no marble, but again very clean and comfortable. Towels were soft and plentiful, lots of hot water (not always the case in hotels in Mexico we heard), and they provided extra towels for swimming. What made the hotel for us was the pool. We had a swim up room which made all the difference; from our little terrace two steps lead down into the pool. It\u2019s not a big square \u2018swimming lengths\u2019 pool, instead in a enclosed courtyard there is a lazy river type pool, with another circle of pool inside that circle of water, and then a deck with a Jacuzzi in the middle. Bridges and stepping stones link it all together, and the space is filled with banana trees and palm trees so it is always cool and shaded. There are also loungers and chairs around, and the hotel bar in very easy reach. Given that you are unlikely to be swimming lengths but more likely cooling and relaxing after or during a hot day, this was perfect for us. The water was always clean and clear, thanks to numerous staff attending it every morning, and because the pool was curved and sheltered by trees, our little piece of it felt very private and was a lovely place to unwind at the end of a day\u2019s sightseeing or diving. The restaurant is also by the pool, so the open air tables are a lovely place to sit in the morning. Speaking of the restaurant, we didn\u2019t eat dinner there but the breakfast every day is included in the room price and is excellent. The choices available run to two pages with the various juices and drinks, servings are large and include any number of Mexican dishes as well as the more usual European type breakfast dishes. I had the fruit plate every morning which was generous and very fresh, my husband had variations on eggs with tortillas, beans, salsa, cheese etc. It was all delicious. We didn\u2019t eat there in the evening for no other reason than we didn\u2019t get round to it. There are lots of places to eat nearby. 5th Avenue is the most obvious location (turn right when you get there, Tropical and Capricioso were both good, La Adele had indifferent food and poor service), on one of the streets between 5th and 10th we found YaxChi which was a fabulous place to eat lunch and a rather smarter place to eat dinner) but the best place we ate was on 10th, where the food tends to be more casual and a good bit cheaper. Turning right and going north out of the hotel, after a few blocks you reach Tocameron, a little place where we had fantastic rice with chicken and sesame, and tortilla with shrimp filling. No alcohol but enormous smoothies, and friendly service. It was almost next to the dive shop; we dived with Pluto Dive who were efficient, friendly and very professional. It takes about 10 minutes to walk there from the hotel, as long as you ignore the map on their website that tells you that they are on the beach. Things to do? We booked trips with the hotel to go to Chichen Itza, Tulum and Coba, all of which were very professionally run and very much worth doing. For two of the three we were picked up at the door; for the third we had to walk to a hotel nearby. We could have gone to Mamitas beach club but never did as we were too busy and the hotel pool was so lovely. The hotel also organised our transfers to and from the airport. Essentially this is one of the loveliest hotels we have stayed in, and we\u2019ll definitely go back.

I have absolutely no problem with tipping (we left cash tips every time) but would have liked to have known this was being charged (and also to have confirmed that this was going directly to the staff) Also when we ate in Aurora there were huge signs outside stating that you got a free cocktail with your meal: we didn't and were charged.

The hotel is not directly on the beach though is only a few hundred yards away. The Mamitas beach club (for which hotel residents get free passes) is about 10-15 mins walk further down the beach, though as the beach around Mamitas is the nicest along Playa Del Carmen we tended to go there each day rather than the beach nearest the hotel. Also the beach club adjacent to Mamitas has much more comfortable chairs and is only $7 per chair per day so we tended to use that one instead. The hotel is also directly around the corner from 5th avenue which has numerous shops and restaurants, though many are very touristy and overpriced and we struggled to find really good Mexican fare along 5th avenue, though the Argentinian steak house called Sur which is right by the hotel on 5th Avenue was excellent. 10th Avenue however is less touristy and has some more authentic looking Mexican restaurants.

To the contrary, it lived up in every way to what I had hoped for. The location was absolutely perfect for me. 1 block from 5th Av., the heart of the downtown shopping, eating, nightlife area. Being a block away, the hotel had none of the noise, but had all of the advantages of being so close. It was an ideal location - close to the dive shop that I wanted to use (Tank-Ha) so that I could get there in 5 minutes each day, and so close to the best restaurants and shopping on 5th. Mine was a completely dive-focused vacation... if you plan on spending each day at the beach, you might not be as enthusiastic with the location. It's a very short walk to the beach, but Tortuga's reserved chairs are further down... so it might get to be a drag, especially if you have kids... might want to try a hotel with their own beach. That said, the hotel staff was exceptional... They know you by name right after you check in, and everyone greets you with very sincere friendly greetings. Maids, waiters, front desk staff... everyone was excellent and friendly. Didn't try the spa, but it looked excellent. Rooms were very comfortable. I had a swim-up room, and it was quite nice, though not \"spacious\" by American standards. For me, it was fine, as I was alone on a dive vacation. I love the terraces out to the pool area. Pool area was beautiful and comprises the whole of the courtyard area. I had room 305, a jacuzzi suite for one night and that was nice. Jacuzzi is up on the roof with private stairs to get there... they've made it pretty private up there with plantings and shades, but one room could certainly look out to see you coming up those steps. (and they lose a little privacy due to your steps that practically look right into their balcony and room.) but the room was nice. \"Suite\" was a little generous for this room... it was about the size of a normal room at a large american chain like a Hilton. Certainly not like an Embassy Suites-sized room. But all was tastefully done. I had swim-up room 112 for the rest of the stay. There are 5 swim-up rooms, and if you can you should ask for 112. It's the end room, so it's not only quieter, but has two other advantages: it's larger than the other swim-ups because the hallway ends at this room so it gets a bit more space. AND, it's the only swim-up room with step-out access to both the upper pools and the lower pools... a nice advantage. Wasn't sure I'd use the pools, but they were great after a long hot day... so relaxing... lots of nooks/crannies to hang out and read or just relax. very nice. There's an upper pool area and a lower pool area, connected by a few little spillovers, it's very well designed. The hotel could probably add a few more english language TV stations. (CNN was reliable, but many other stations were dubbed into spanish including Disney, Nick, etc. so kids may be disappointed in that if TV is important to your family.) There's wi-fi and a free internet PC in the bar area. (was sometimes hard to get on it... they might want to add a 2nd PC soon). Here's another tip... something I couldn't figure out before I came: Cellphone access. This hotel had VERY strong Verizon coverage (or whatever provider I roamed to...) my cellphone worked just great here... in fact it did throughout the downtown Playa area. Everything worked as expected... decent showers. (no tubs in most rooms), fresh filtered water bottles delivered to you each morning and night. I only had breakfast at the hotel's restaurant, but it was great. (and Free!) - omelette's, fruit, juices, coffee, other egg dishes, meats... all great. And the staff here incredibly friendly too. In summary, if you're interested in a quiet, friendly, safe, beautiful hotel close to the action and beaches of Playa without the noise of being above a nightclub, then Tortuga will be excellent. The only caution is that if you're expecting a beachfront resort with games and toys for kids, or you want to stumble out of your room in the morning directly onto a beach chair in the waves, then this isn't your place. All in all, it was an excellent stay and I can recommend this hotel highly... --josh", "Date": "July 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cPretty good experience, would stay again.\u201d", "Author": "Julie A", "ReviewID": "UR8090879", "Content": "Well, I think my rating would be more like a 4.5, because we really loved the hotel, but did have some minor issues. The positives: LOVED the pool!! It is really awesome and everyone worked really hard to keep it clean and maintained. At happy hour the waiters come around to offer 2 for 1 drinks. The sunbeds are absolutely phenomenal. The pool area is a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10. The breakfast was excellent. I didn't find the choices to be monotonous, and I was expecting small portions since it was included, but they were huge. The coffee was great (sometimes hard to find American tasting coffee in Playa), the bread was tasty, and overall loved the food. Favorite was the Chilaquiles w/scrambled eggs. Check in was so easy, but I felt like this was an extension of the planning process, which was, literally, the best vacation planning I have ever had. Anna is fantastic, responsive and thorough before you get there, and the staff is that way when you get there. We were greeted with a fruit drink when we got there, which was a nice touch, and check in was a breeze. We didn't experience any nickel & dime charges, which I have seen mentioned here, and coffee was available in the mornings at the bar area (complimentary). The rooms were very nicely decorated, plain but nice (most hotels we have stayed in Playa are similiar). The linens were nice, loved the furniture on the porch of our swim-up room, and I didn't think the room was small at all. Just the right size for two people. There was plenty of hot water and the shower pressure was good. The room had a small flat screen with some American channels. We had an issue with a travel companion missing a flight, but they were so gracious and accomodating in rearranging the transportation for her. We were so grateful to have Mariana at the front desk to help out. The negatives: This was my fifth stay in Playa, and this was the absolute hardest bed I have ever slept on. We had fellow travelers in the hotel, and their beds were practically pillow-top, so I think I would just ask for a different room next time. We had a swim up room, which faces the pool. Every morning by about eight or so, they would start playing the new-agey music by the pool/bar, which I could hear in my room and could not go back to sleep. The music is cool, but it seems like it could be turned down lower or later in that area. We had one cleanliness issue, which I raised, and it was resolved immediately. I noticed a couple of other minor cleanliness issues, but I did not mention them. Perhaps the staff needs some further pointers on hitting the details of the room (i.e. edges of the bathroom counters, light switch areas, baseboards). I am pretty nit-picky, which is why I didn't complain, but others out there may be as nit-picky as I am. Last, there were no wash cloths for bathing. Maybe it is an American thing to use wash cloths for bathing, but they didn't provide them at all. We thought that was strange, but would just bring our own next time. If you normally use them to bathe, bring your own. Overall, we really liked the hotel. This was our fifth trip to Playa in about 3 years, and this is the first hotel we would do a repeat in. I would just ask for a different room away from noisier areas and request one of the rooms with the newer beds. Thanks again Anna, Mariana and Bernando, as well as the staff of the Agora for all of your help and hosting. (Other properties we have stayed in: Mosq. Blue, Luna Blue, Vilas Sacbe Condo, Iber.

We stayed at La Tortuga Hotel the whole week and had the best experience!! We had arranged with the hotel manager, a private car to come and pick us up at the airport. Even though our flight had been 3 hours late, when we stepped out of the airport, the driver was waiting for us. Obviously, the hotel is very responsible toward guests. We were so relieved and happy!! When we arrived at the hotel, the doorman, Alfredo, was so helpful and kind. Mariana, the woman at the front desk was so welcoming and explained everything clearly. During the entire week, all of the staff, including the cleaning staff, were so wonderful. They never failed to have a smile on their faces and say a friendly Hola to us whenever we were on hotel grounds. We had never had such wonderful and attentive service ever in another hotel. The free breakfast every morning was too good to be true. Next door, the restaurant let us choose a free beverage and free meal (ordered from a menu) each morning. The room itself (we stayed in a Suite with a rooftop jacuzzi) was a good size with plenty of closet space. There was a t.v. with many many channels (some in english, some in spanish), A/C which saved us from the heat many times, a fan, beautiful balcony, comfortable bed, and everything was very clean. The rooftop jacuzzi was very well maintained and great for cooling off!! The location of the hotel is too perfect. It is on a quiet street, but right as you walk out the front door and turn right for a block, you hit the main street, which is bustling and lively, full of restaurants and shops.

Pool is excellent... very relaxing and unique. Hotel is small-medium sized, so there is a certain feeling of intimacy. Not close to the beach, but not too far to walk either (about 10-15 minute walk). The rooms are decent... nothing to brag about. Our room was clean, but smallish. The bathroom layout is annoying. The glass shower door barely has enough room to open due to the poor placement of a bidet right in front of it. The beds are very firm, but not uncomfortable. The maids turned the A/C off every day despite my polite notes requesting that they leave it on. And, the A/C takes a long time to cool the room... so, leaving it on would've been helpful. The restaurant gives you free breakfast... as long as you are careful not to order \"special\" items (soda, latte, shake, etc.). After about 2 days of eating from the restaurant, you quickly get tired of the food selection... it all starts to taste the same. Service at the restaurant is very friendly, but somewhat slow. We had a slight ant problem in the bathroom near the sink. The ants stayed in the sink area... so, it wasn't that big of a deal. The hotel charges you $1/day to use the in-room safe. They also add 12% to your total bill for tax upon checking out. I would highly-suggest requesting a pool-facing room. The rooms that face the street are noisy at night and the view is anything but pleasant... abandoned lots, etc. The hotel is conveniently-located close to shopping, restaurants, drug store, etc. The hotel staff was courteous, friendly, and helpful at all times. I think that for the price ($140/night average after tax), this hotel is a good pick. The things I've pointed out may seem negative... but, I am just trying to give a thorough review.

We had been concerned that perhaps noisy pool-goers would disturb us, but the portion of the meandering pool that passes in front of the room patios is narrow so folks don't hang out there. My hubbie says that one night he did hear music (probably from the clubs or bars on Quinta Avenida) playing pretty late into the night, but I didn't hear anything during the 5 nights we were there and slept soundly. A/C or a ceiling fan is available to keep you comfortable through the night. Breakfast was included, and the selections were very good. We loved every breakfast dish we ordered. Fresh mango shakes and fruit juices. Very close walking distance to the main drag with shops, restaurants, bars, clubs, etc. The beach club is a little bit more of a walk, but I can't say exactly timewise, because we drove there. It is a very nice beach, with comfortable lounge chairs and large attractive thatch umbrellas. Nice facilities to rinse off the sand and changing rooms. Across the street from the hotel is a quickie pharmacy for any emergency needs like antibiotic ointment, bug spray, feminine items, soft drinks, etc. A bank is about a block away to exchange your currency. Only complaint may be that there was a little bit of damage to the mirror in our bathroom, but the mirror was very large horizontally so it didn't get in the way of two people getting ready in front of it.

I had intended to write a review once we returned home to help others make a decision but only found the time now. We chose a swim up room for the novelty and it was great to just walk out the patio and take a dip whenver I wanted to. Everyone on trip advisor said the rooms were tiny, so we expected such but it was fine. This is what you get....3.5 feet, a king bed, and another 3.5 feet. I would say you get 3.5 ft from the bottom of the bed to the wall as well. I found a niche to put my suitcase in and my husband used his 3.5 feet of floor space. On the positive side, we never lost anything!!! The bed was hard, but we had no difficulty falling asleep. The room was clean, and plainly decorated, but we spent very little time in it. Next time, however, I might select a larger room. The grounds are gorgeous and very relaxing. I found myself taking hundreds of photos of the scenery, and I couldn't improve from the ones you see on the website taken by other guests. There is always someone tending to the property. Breakfast was great. You get to order 1 cold drink, 1 hot drink and an entree. I tried something different every morning. The first day we went outside and ate on the street side of Agora. But we much preferred eating on the side that faces the swimming pool. Things we had and enjoyed were: omelets, pancakes, fruit platters and even a ham and cheese sandwich on a baguette (if you are not a breakfast person) One day I tried the Mayan Omelet, which includes everything but the kitchen sink. It was interesting and freshly prepared, but I only tried it because we were in Riviera Maya. Mamita's is truly the best beach in town, as we took the beach route one day and other beaches are rocky and small. We arrived before 10 a.m. every day and had no trouble getting an umbrella and beach chairs. The walk there was about 15 minutes and pleasant. When you've had enough beach and want to get back to the hotel, the walk seems a little longer. But then I thought about that great pool awaiting me. My husband took advantage of the new spa upstairs and really enjoyed it. Happy hour....2-for-1 around 5 p.m. was great. The drinks were better here than in other places in town. It was also nice to meet other hotel guests. We met a young couple, Matt and Chris, that were a joy to talk to. They had traveled the world and were working their way up the Mayan coast. Location.....right around the corner is Fifth Avenue. You don't even have to cross a street and you are in the pedestrian walkway. We took a walk one night to the southern end of the Avenue, and it was noisier, Carlos & Charlies, cruise ships, etc. So, we liked the area near La Tortuga to dine and shop better. I know I'm forgetting some things....but all in all, La Tortuga was my kind of hotel. It was clean, service was good and I wouldn't hesitate to return. Just as an aside....we checked out 2 other hotels that we were considering and that received good reviews on trip advisor.

The balcony was also acceptabel, it had a table and 2 nice chairs and view of the pool. The beds were hard at first, but after I asked the reception for a solution they changed the matresses the same day for brand new ones.

The dinner was also very nice, allthough we had the complete restaurant for ourselfs (it never is very crowded). Swimming Pool: Very, very nice. It's not a huge pool with volleybal nets etc in it and we think that is a absolute plus! It's very well kept and everything looks very tropical.

I find this\" any excuse for a mattress\" thrown on a frame ,no box spring, propped up on wood blocks (in a room priced only $10/night less than the beautiful oceanfront condo we had in Cozumel ) inexcusable in a \"SPA\" hotel. Our night there was the most miserable we have ever suffered. I hate to see a hotel with so much going for it lose out because it seems to not understand basic sleeping comfort. Maybe we had the only room with such a horrible bed, maybe not.... we won't go back to find out. In the past I myself have been guilty of packing blow up rafts and cushy matts (on our flight home i was planning to purchase an aero mattress to take on our next trip)so we could sleep on the miserable beds we find traveling.

Believing all the super positive and over exaggerated reviews, we expected too much perhaps. The hotel: The online reservation was easy with help from Ms. Anna. Also, the check in (as well as check-out) was a piece of cake with a smiling front desk person. Nevertheless, bellboys at La Tortuga do not have the habit of at least offering to carry your luggage to your room after 10 hours of traveling, even if they are two small carry-ons. As we all know, even the most modest hotels have some sort of bellboy system that assists customers on this. This would not only improve service quality but also help the bellboy earn extra $10- 20 a day. I have seen the same thing happening to other new customers who were checking in later in the week. The room was absolutely old and run down, although clean (and kept clean as it should be in any other hotel). The bathroom/shower was old and almost rusty (but clean). The size of the room was no bigger that a medium size bathroom, although we do not complain about the size at this point. Hotel is relatively small and cramped but no complaints on this as well. Bar is placed I between the pool shower, restaurant entrance, and stairs that goes up to the rooms. I would suggest owner to place the bar to the hidden but gorgeous roof top or all the way back under the trees so drinkers can have more privacy and guests can walk to their rooms with avoiding shouldering drinking fellow guests. Pity that the hotel is trying its best to skim dime from customers. The pool table, which is right next to the bar, is pay-as-you-play. You need to put in 5 pesos (50 US cents) to play a game. Besides the low cost, main issue is the fact that pool table which is part of the hotel amenity should be free to hotel guests to use. This only gives this hotel a truck-stop quality at the gain of several 50 cents. After seeing this, we decided not to spent a dime in this hotel and went out to eat and drink in local establishments (luckly). The hotel lost several hundred dollars of business just because it was trying to get 50 cents from guest by charging to use the pool table. To many, this may not be an issue, but for us, this issue is a good indication of quality for this hotel. The pool look gorgeous visually, but it is not very functional as it is narrow and non-continues if you like to swim around. But as we observed, the stuff spent good time to try to keep it clean as it is under several large trees. There are several good aspect to this hotel, well mainly one: the breakfast. Unlike some other complaints, the menu is sufficient; service is proper as it should be. This is not Dennys and you cannot have all you can eat breakfast in a hotel. The room was cleaned on time, as it should. AC worked, as it should. Water pressure and temperature were right, as they should. Mamita\u2019s Beach Club: The free beach club is about a mile walk, but no complaints again, it is a good opportunity to see around and discover if you take the 10th avenue rather that the tourist trapping 5th. 10th avenue is the one that you will exit when leaving the hotel. There are several hidden restaurants, eateries that are not overpriced and serviced well. The beach club opens early, if you like to get beach chairs with umbrellas (which is a must in Playa\u2019s heat) go there before 10, or even 9:30 am. The food and drink service, if you order while on the beach is very slow with low quality of menu, but high prices comparable to New York City. (See my playa review to learn about new Playa del Carmen of 2007, as cost and low quality is a major problem in Playa del Carmen today). If you like to eat during the lunch while at Mamitas, lay towels on your beach chairs (no worries, no one is going to steal them) and go to the next beach clubs restaurants called \u201cKool\u201d on the left to eat as food Is not free in both places. Kool has excellent service and lower prices with greatest selection. Mamitas has separate section called \u2018lounge\u201d on the right side which is not free for hotel guests and staff will try to charge you anywhere between 20 to 40 USD. This part is supposed to be cooler section with \u201chype\u201d Mexico City fellows. In final, I would say following: This hotel has nothing extra ordinary to offer. The photos on its website is very \u201cPhotoshopped\u201d as rooms are old. It does not even have minimal quality understanding to assist its checking customers to carry their carry-ons (like Motel 8). Paying 50 cents to play to Hotels own pool table is cheap cheap cheap. La Tortuga is a less than average hotel/motel with no quality, no extraordinary service and facilities. About Playa: This is our second time in Playa. Playa is getting very expensive. It is fine that it is getting expensive as it is getting popular. But in contrast, the quality of service is falling down as well. If Playa is as expensive as New York City, it should offer facilities in comparison to NYC. Nevertheless, most of the 5th avenue restaurants have been typical expensive tourist traps. Fortunately, you can find good eateries on 10th avenue priced from $4 to $24. Best low cost eateries are Mr. Kiwi and Doctor Taco with excellent tacos unlike you have ever tasted in the USA. Mr. Kiwi has super large T-bone steaks for less than $8. Yes both places are pretty simple and local looking but they are also very original-Playa and safe as well. Both places are on the left when exiting the hotel and great for lunch and late, late dinners. On the left of the hotel, on 10th again, about quarter mile down, try Parillo Argentin steakhouse, which is a nice and small place to have some of the best steaks you can have ever. Prices ranges from $9 to $22, with bottle Mexican table wine for $14, try the chorizo appetizer. Also not on 10th avenue but 10th street, do not miss the famous Babe\u2019s Thai restaurant with great food and $3.5 UDS margaritas and mojitos, which are very well made. Again service is great, get a seat on the bar and eat and drink there if possible. Also, AVOID \u201cLos Rancheros\u201d restaurant on 5th Avenue horrible food and non-English speaking waiters who took your orders wrong and try to charge you for it. I hope my long review may help some new visitors to Playa.

After months of reading reviews, looking at warm locations, and researching numerous hotels I decided on La Tortuga. I had never been to Playa Del Carmen only to the other side of Mexico ( Puerto Vallarta). Playa Del Carmen was so beautiful it was breathtaking. The hotel is one of the cleanest hotels I have ever stayed in, ( I have stayed at the Ritz Carlton on numerous occasions). It was even more quaint and beautiful than I have imagined. Down to basics, The room. We stayed in room 117. A king size suite with a jacuzzi hot tub. It was not a swim up room but it was 2 feet from the pool to our patio. The room had a large king size bed, and yes, the bed was hard, however, we slept at least 10 hours peacefully every night. The air conditioning for my boyfriend was wonderful. He loves having it cranked and they keep an extra blanket in the closet for those who don't like it quite as cold. The new suites are very hip and modern in my opinion. We also had a jacuzzi tub in our bathroom that we did not use. There is a place to hang your clothes and also a suitcase rack to put one suitcase. The room is not very big however, you have a cute patio with 2 chairs and a hammock to lay in and watch the gorgeous pool, and vegetation. The rooftop was awesome. We had numerous evenings that we used the jacuzzi. I brought bath bubbles from home for the full effect. The hotel is very convenient. We were so close to everything however, the way it is designed we never felt closed in or too close to allot of people. The staff here is WONDERFUL! They were so genuinely nice and helpful on all occasions. Anna was wonderful on email, our transporation was set up through the hotel and was $80.00 round trip. It was nice for us traveling there for the first time to not have to worry about getting to Playa Del Carmen. The driver was on time on both occasions. We had our room made up every day along with turn down service at night including ice cold bottled water left on our bed. Our favorite part of the day was happy hour... We planned our day around 5 pm. My boyfriend drank beer I drank fabulous mojitios. At 5pm drinks are buy one get one free... The bar does get alittle busy around 5pm and it gives you a chance to interact with other guests if you like. Most guests seem to be in couples and there just to relax and have a good time. There is also beer stocked in your hotel bar, for $2.00 a beer. You can go purchase beer at almost any little store for a $1.00 a beer, however, it is quite convenient to have it stocked for you. The pool is beautiful along with the vegetation surrounding the pool area. There are about 6 lounging chairs along with grass or bridges to sit on around the pool. There is also a bed in the shade that we would read books on when returning from the beach and needing shade. There is a lounge area a few steps up from the pool that they call the solarium. It is furnished with comfy sofa like laying places and big umbrellas. There is a jacuzzi in the pool area that we never used due to our own private jacuzzi. You can check your email or reseach on line trips. I have to admit that I was happy to never check my email while there. The Beach: O.k. I am one who likes to be beachfront on vacation however, I didn't mind it in Playa. It is about a 10-15 minute walk which is great after breakfast when I am so full.... We always walked down to 5th avenue and went through the quaint streets. At the hotel they give you beach towels every day along with a pass to MAMITAS BEACH CLUB. The beach is so GORGEOUS.!!! Just stupid how blue the water is. After reading many reviews, I always worried about getting chairs with an umbrella and we always had one. We were never later than 10am. You must get an umbrella, it is too hot to sit in the sun all day. We had drinks from MAMITAS every day, it gets very hot and you want drinks. Make sure to bring cash because they do not take credit cards. We also had a snack there one day. Nothing to write home about but pretty cheap and decent. Food: I think we are kinda light eaters.At the hotel the breakfast every morning was huge and I always felt so full... The pancakes are great. Fresh fruit with yogurt was one of my favorites also. I ordered a ham and cheese baguette one morning and it is literally a sub with mayonnaise. My boyfriend ate it and I ate his pancakes. I did order a strawberry shake one morning which was additional but I wanted to try it, quite good.... Ask about the MAYAN Omelette, our waiter enjoyed explaining it. We never ate lunch at the restaurant. For dinner we had shrimp and chicken fajitias. HUGE PORTIONS and they came with french fries, very good.... Also we loved their calamari. We also had the bruschetta which was good. I ordered a salad one night with pears and gorgonzola cheese, did not like the balsalmic dressing, too much honey or something weird in it. Out to eat: 5th avenue was overwhelming for me. Trying to decide to eat. We ate at an Italian restaurant one evening and it was not good at all and more expensive than it was worth. I would probably stick to places that are busy and serving mexican food. Our last night I demanded that we go to HC Monterey because I had read numerous reviews about it. It was our BEST MEAL of the trip. It is alittle far, so we took a cab there and walked home. For $9.00 you get amazing flank steak, baked potato, half an avocado and a pepper. I was so full, it is alot of food. We also had corona's. The waiters only speak spanish and the menu is only in spanish, however, it is well worth going off the beaten path to get. The only excurision we took was XEL-HA. We LOVED IT! The only thing we didn't love was buying the $16.00 environmentally safe sunscreen lotion and still getting burnt. I would recommend trying to buy something in the states or on 5th avenue that is o.k. However, if we were going away I would probably just spray 30 on me very heavily before leaving the hotel. You are in the water and sun all day long. We took public transporation to XEL-HA for $4.00 a person each way. The bus station was clean and easy to take about a 45 minute ride. Also, MAKE SURE You buy an water camera for the day. I am not sure how much they normally are, however, they are expensive at the park and you really will want one. I didn't swim with the dolphins due to the $$ price. For an all day pass inclusive, which I highly recommend it was $60.00 to swim with the dolphins for 1/2 hour it is $80.00 a person. On our next trip we HAVE to go to the Ruins along with a trip to Cozumel. We stayed 5 nights and it just wasn't long enough to see everything and feel relaxed at the same time. All in all, I am sure that we will be back to Playa staying at the La Tortuga Hotel. My boyfriend and I agreeded it was the best vacation we had ever had. If you have any questions about Playa or La Tortuga please feel free to drop me a note. If you are going to La Tortuga, please have a happy hour drink for me:)", "Date": "May 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Knoxville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cLoved It\u201d", "Author": "Jenellway", "ReviewID": "UR7633062", "Content": "We arrived in Playa with no reservations so that we could walk around and see the different hotels before making a decision.

Our intentions were to stay at a couple of different hotels during our ten day visit, but after checking out a few more hotels, we decided that we liked La Tortuga the most. Due to other folks' reservations we changed rooms a couple of times in order to stay the entire length of our vacation. Each time we changed rooms the incredibly friendly staff placed our luggage in the new room while we went on excursions during the day.

It is one of the smaller, boutique hotels built prior to the large, mega-resorts that have recently taken over the Maya Riviera coast. This is the perfect antidote to civilization...a fantastic place to relax in warm, friendly ambience and soak up the sun. La Tortuga is just around the corner from 5th Avenue shops, restaurants and bars, but otherwise in a quiet town location. Most rooms overlook the beautiful tropical garden/pool area. Pleasant new age music plays as you loll in your own private corner of the pool or relax on one of the sun beds while the efficient staff quietly goes about their job of keeping the pool area spotless, or serving tropical drinks and delicious food in the adjacent Agora bar/restaurant. I ate most of my meals here because it was elegant in an unpretentious way, the food was delicious and the service very friendly and attentive. Why go elsewhere? I did opt for pizza one night at Pizza Pazzo as I was just too filled up after all those huevos rancheros breakfasts with homemade bread and fresh squeezed juice and dinners with homemade tortilla chips and tangy pico di gallo to snack on while waiting for the main course. The 15% discount offered to hotel guests was a definite plus. The Itza Spa is on the premises, a good place to detox in the sauna or vapor lodge, get a great massage (Gina is the best!), or an elaborate beauty treatment. I love small homey hotels and with the added convenience of Agora restaurant and Itza spa, you can't go wrong at La Tortuga.

I thank all those reviews before mine in as it solidified our choice. Before our arrival, I corresponded with Anna on several occasions. She was very prompt in returning my emails and answered all my questions. We flew into Cozumel and took the ferry to Playa. This, I must say is more convenient then flying into Cancun and then taking the $80 for two people round trip shuttle. It cost us about $5 for a taxi to the Cozumel Ferry and then it was $10 per person on the ferry. Not only was it a neat 30 minute ride, when you get off the boat, LA TORTUGA is about a 10 minute walk or 1 minute taxi ride away. Simply put, everyone working at La Tortuga and Agora's (hotel restaurant) were delightful and were genuinely concerned about making our experience that much more comfortable. The only drawback was Silvia (front office). She was not so friendly as everyone else was. Some employees who really went out of their way were Santy and Armado in Agora's restauarant. ROOM: We stayed in 206. The room was plenty big. It had a king size bed and a balcony that overlooks the tropical oasis type pool. They provide most toiletries. There is a closet to put your clothes but there is no dresser. Also in the room is a television with very few American channels and a small refrigerator that had sodas, water, and beer for a nominal charge. POOL: We spent a lot of time in the pool and hot tub. Absolutely Bliss. The tropical plants and trees, clear water, small water falls, top of line pool furniture, hot tub, cozy areas for shade and sun, Santy and Armado making sure our drink and food needs were met, open aired lobby, tiki torches and the different bird calls all made this a very tranquil place. Simply put. AGORA RESTAURANT: Breakfast that is included consists of a menu item, bread, coffee and juice. This will fill you up. The food as pictured tasted great. We had lunch a couple of times. It was delivered right to your lounge chair by Santy or Armado. The restaurant has very reasonable prices and large portions. Detail and presentation were top notch. MAMITAS BEACH CLUB: Another nice touch about La Tortuga are the free beach passes. You get beach lounge chairs and a palapa umbrella. You will need the palapa as it gets brutal in the sun all day. Waiters deliver food and drink to your chairs for a somewhat reasonable price. The menu hasn't changed for several years now. Now, if there is a drawback, it would be the walk. It is a good 15 minutes away from La Tortuga. I personally enjoyed the exercise but there are some that would find it difficult. But then again Playa Del Carmen is a city that you can walk to everything. SPA ITZA: Of all the massages that I have received, the one I received here was by far the best. The spa has very reasonable prices. Don't forget the one time 10% discount you get when staying at La Tortuga. MORE NOTABLES: Pay attention to all the detail and decor in this hotel. Its really amazing. For light sleepers such as myself, there is a club one street over that starts playing some music at 1 am and continues to 6 am. There is so much more to say about the hotel and playa but go experience it for yourself.

The hotel is in a convenient location - one block from the \"Quinta\" - the main shopping street. So, it was quieter, which we liked. We were very happy with the onsite restaurant, where we had breakfast every morning. One menu item, coffee and a beverage is included with with your room, other items are extra - which the waiters remind you of. All staff were friendly and tried to help us with our Spanish, though most knew enough English to get by. There is also a small, cozy bar between the restaurant and the rooms where you can get an early morning cup of coffee, have a cocktail (they make excellent Mojitos) or get on the internet. We also had some lunches and two dinners at the restaurant. The best thing about La Tortuga was the pool. The hotel does not look like much from the outside, but when you enter - you walk down an open air walkway that leads to a courtyard where the pool is the central feature. The pool has several deep areas, connected by narrow, deep river-like smimming areas. There are lovely walkways - either made of stone or teak - and a hot tub in the middle. The only down side of the hotel is its proximatey to the beach. The hotel is a member of beach club \"Mamitas,\" which I think was the best beach in the area. However, it is a good 7 blocks away. So, if you don't mind the walk, the beach is very nice. Get there by 10:00 if you want to reserve beach chairs with an umbrella. If you come a hair past 10:30, only chairs in the blazing sun are left. Lastly, save some time at the end of your stay for a massage at the adjoining \"Spa Itza.\" My boyfriend and I booked together and ended up having our treatments in the same room, which was pretty nice. Go at least a half hour early and enjoy the roof top sauna. We only had enough time for 10 minutes in the sauna. If we were to go again, we would have gotten in the sauna, stepped outside and cooled off in the rooftop shower, and stepped back in the sauna again.

For example, we found the beds very hard and when we asked them for assistance, they put extra blankets on the matress in order to make them softer. It wasn't perfect, but was 'less hard\". They did the best they could, which we appreciated. The common areas at La Tortuga are wonderful. We really enjoyed relaxing by the pool and catching up on emails in the evening in the bar area. The breakfast every morning was very good, and the service was great. The only disappointment we had was the actual rooms themselves. We booked a junior suite w/rooftop jacuzzi. Well, this was not a \"suite\" by our normal standards. The room had two queen beds and that's about it. No place to sit...except on the balcony. The rooftop jacuzzi was \"underwhelming\" as well. We looked at a couple other rooms, thinking we might change rooms, but they were just as small and bare, so we stayed put. It was fine overall, but not what we were expecting. While there we ate at an offbeat restaurant that served the best flank steak we ever ate. It's called HC Monterey. You must eat there...truly an experience. We also had some spa services.

We chose the hotel b/c he's a big fan of small, boutique hotels (read $$$), but I'm a fan of a bargain, so after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor, this Tortuga seemed like a good compromise. Happily, we were both fairly satisfied. We didn't get off to an auspicious start as we arrived well after midnight on our first night. The staff was not there and we were greeted by security. They did not know where our room was and we schlepped our heavy luggage around the entire place only to eventually end up in a room right off the reception area! The room (#116) was large and modern, but it also seemed unfinished. There was no dresser or luggage stand--no place to put our luggage excpet the floor. A small flat screen floated in the middle of a huge wall. The room was also dark and right next to the staff room and restaurant (as we discovered the next morning being awakened by the noise). But, we were exhausted after a long flight delay and a ridiculous experience with Mexican immigration, so we went to bed. After, a nice breakfast, we explained the situation to Benjamin and he arranged for us to have a different room. It was smaller and on the outside of the hotel (street noise), but it had great light, enough furniture to be complete and we still had a roof-top jacuzzi. All in all, the staff was very nice, especially the restaurant staff, and we loved coming back from the beach to find a different towel creation and chilled water by the bed. We would definitely recommend getting a junior suite--the privacy of a personal terrace and jacuzzi was relaxing and romantic. The management really seems to be intent on keeping the place up and continuing to invest in the property. And the price is great. Some of the other boutique places we looked at were up to US$600 per night!! The location is great (one block from 5th) and central, so you can walk either way for shops and restaurants. Mamita's was a nice beach and the walk didn't bother us at all. The attached restaurant served good food and offered good prices. The complimentary breakfast was really good, with lots of choice. There aren't a ton of chairs around the pool, but the solarium is very nice (cool lounge fixtures--my high-end bfriend was impressed) and the pool is only a few steps away. This is not a luxury place, if that's what you're looking for, but it is a great bargain, well-kept, comfortable, clean, well-located, relaxing and low-key. We would definitely recommend it for those reasons. The only negative experience--do not purchase tour packages from the hotel. There is a HEFTY mark-up as we discovered later. You're better off walking into one of the tour places on 5th (we liked Odyssey) and buying directly. You get the exact same tour with the exact same tour operators for at least 20% less.", "Date": "April 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tulsa, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cLa Tortuga\u201d", "Author": "wbstauffer", "ReviewID": "UR7347107", "Content": "We just got back from a trip to Playa.

The pool was beautiful but the area isn't very sunny. If you want a spot in the shade get a chair early since it is so limited. The beach club was nice as well. (Guys will like it, lots of topless women) It wasn't that far of a walk, (maybe 10 min) but we rented a scooter and got there in less than 2 minutes. Scooters are a great mode of transportation there because you can park anywhere and drive it right up to many resturants. If you stay at La Tortuga don't be cheap and get a standard room. We stayed in one of the new junior suites with a jacuzzi in it. I would seriously recommend that since the outside jacuzzi is always crowded, and with your own jacuzzi there is no need to wear a bathing suit =) The room was huge and brand new, we couldn't have been happier. I heard that the standard rooms and even swim rooms were smaller so stay in a junior suite. I would def. recommend our room #118... it was so private and right next to the pool. The food at the restuartant was very good, but take advantage of all the amazing restuarants on fifth ave, which is only a block away. Bernando at the front was so helpful, as was everyone else. My husband wasn't feeling to good one night and they actually went to the drug store for us... I couldn't have asked for better service.

'07 and I was VERY excited for our trip. We had visited in Dec. '05 and loved Playa Del Carmen and our hotel (The Blue Parrot). Unfortunately, we couldn't stay at the same hotel because they were booked, so instead I researched hotels on this website. Immediately, I was very excited to read the amazing reviews of La Tortuga. Hands down, it was/is one of the best reviewed hotels in Playa. It deserves some of the praise - nice pool/lounge area, Mamitos beach passes and amazing breakfast..... Now the bad.... When we walked into our room (standard, small balcony facing pool) I was a little put off by the small size, but it wasn't that bad. What was really inconvienent was there wasn't a dresser or anything to unpack your suitcase. There was a small closet with one shelf, but that's it. We had to live out of our suitcases all week. Also, and this is minor, I had ordered a bottle of champagne for our check-in because this was a special vacation. When we got in the room, the champagne was warm in an empty bucket. I had to call for a bucket of ice and then wait a couple hours to have it chilled. So far, minor issues by my standards. After all, it's a vacation! Next though, we took a shower and the entire bathroom flooded because the shower curtain was old and small and didn't even reach the ground. We had to use all the towels in the room just to soak up the flood. At this point, I asked the front desk if we could maybe switch rooms or upgrade and she said she didn't have anything else all week. (To their credit, they replaced the shower curtain the next day and it kept about 80% of the water in the shower - which was a big improvement.) We decided to just go with the flow but then after dinner the second night we went back to our room only to open the door and have a HUGE cockroach greet us. Yeah, I wasn't happy - at all. As the rest of the week progressed, other minor things were annoying. For instance, in order to adjust the airconditioner you have to climb on the refrigerator. Also, because we were in a standard room, we were the last ones to get our daily housekeeping. We would come home from the beach at 4pm and our room still wasn't cleaned. Each day after the beach we had to go get clean towels at the front desk and then rush to take a shower so we could leave the room around 5PM for them to clean - really inconvienent.

One critique I would make is that the room itself lacked character, bare walls, no music, and white bedding, I guess the hotel spends most of it's income on maintaining the grounds.

Gorgeous upkeep of the hotel...the maid came in (after we left at like 10pm for dinner) to \"re-make\" our bed one night (after she had already cleaned it earlier in the day).

Breakfast is included in your price, and it is actually tasty!! Cons: 1. The hotel is directly adjacent to a major nightclub. We stayed on the third floor of the hotel, and it sounded as though the club was in our bathroom blasting music until 6am. On the other side, when you are on the first floor, you can't hear the club...so it may just depend on where you are in the hotel. Either way, it was extremely annoying and made it incredibly hard to sleep. 2. The beach club is a trek past other fantastic beach clubs. While the entire beach strip is GORGEOUS, it's kind of disappointing when you go 7 blocks (through like 3 other beach clubs), just to get to the one where you can sit on a chair for free. We were tempted to just rent a chair at a closer club. 3. The suites are significantly larger than the standard room, so you may want to consider that if you are booking.

Other: We didn't notice a problem with noise at all. In fact, we thought it was quiet. Like I said, my husband is a sensitive sleeper (who claims our cat wakes him up) and he didn't notice noise.

My husband asked one of the staff for their network password (or something like that), which they gave to him. Then we had no problem accessing the internet on our laptop in our room. That said, we never saw a line for the computer by the bar and almost wished we hadn't messed with bringing our laptop. Mamitas is the best beach club in Playa. BUT, make sure you get there sometime in the morning....the sooner the better. If you go in the afternoon, they will be full. That happened to us one day, which made us mad because we couldn't use our free passes and had to go to another club and pay $6 each. It's better to go in the morning anyway before the sun gets too intense in the later afternoon. Waiters brought us margaritas and food (right to our umbrella!), and the prices were reasonable (cheaper than in the US). We didn't stay in one of the junior suites, but overall I'd say don't stay here if you're expecting luxury. If that's what you want, go stay in one of those fancy all-inclusive places.

The tilework was shoddy, the woodwork is cheap, and the bath hardware was confusing, (a blast of unintentional hot water on your sunburn isn't fun). 6. The safe. They charge you $1 per night for a lock and key. Really annoying to be nickeled and dimed. 7. Vouchers. To get breakfast, a towel, or go to the beach club, you have to go to the front desk and get a voucher every time. There are always people checking out in the morning, so you wait in line to get a stupid piece of paper. This is convenient for them, not me. Good stuff: The beach club they're associated with (Mamitas) is one of the best. These may sound picky, but we stayed 3 nights at Magic Blue across the street for virtually the same price, and every single one of these issues was non-existant.

The week before our stay, I contacted the hotel for a restaurant recommendation for my husband's birthday. When we arrived, not only had they made the reservation, they had decorated the room! That is just on example of their exceptional attention to detail and service. We stayed in a junior suite with a roof-top jacuzzi. The room was very large with a separate staircase that went to a private roof deck. The jacuzzi is sort of an over-sized jacuzzi-bathtub, but nice. The next category down has tiny rooms. The property is very clean, the pool was nicely laid out, and the deck and the solarium were always comfortable and pleasant. The hotel is well located near 5th, so we walked everywhere. The transportation to the airport is worth it. They pick you up at the airport (even though our plane was 2 hours late) and take you back for your return. Two things that could be improved: the beds are rock hard! you do get used to it after a few days. The other issue is the beach club. La Mamita beach club is not a positive experience. We arrived a bit late (10 am) and we were told that chairs and umbrelllas are held until noon for people who arrive early. If they don't return to claim the chairs around 12:30, they are released to people waiting. Although we waited quietly, we forgot to bribe the beach monitor. Available chairs were given to a group that showed up at 12:30 and slipped him some money. The next minute a girl showed up - had some interaction with the beach chair monitor - and voila' - she had 4 chairs and an umbrella. We mentioned these problems to the La Tortuga, so they would know. We did not return to La Mamita. We did go next door to the Tukan club (which by the way has better service and nicer chairs) and had a very positive experience. My recommendation is to explore other options so you don't waste your time at Mamitas! Aside from Mamitas beach club, we would definitely stay at La Tortuga again. The staff is excellent - Juan Carlos (JC), Silvia, Anna and everyone else goes out of their way to be helpful and nice.", "Date": "March 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Farmington Hills, MI", "Title": "\u201cOur annual visit to PDC\u201d", "Author": "StewartsLucy", "ReviewID": "UR7114008", "Content": "My husband & I just spent our annual week in PDC. This is the first time at La Tortuga. We had room 310. It was nice. The grounds are pretty. Juan Carlos was the most friendly and helpful of the staff. This room is considered standard plus. Our balcony overlooked the pool and beautiful trees. The room was clean, we like the firm mattresses in Mexico, which is funny cuz we have a temperpedic style one at home. There was some construction noise in the morning, but it wasn't too bad. Something is being built next door to the hotel... The biggest disappointment we had is that their is no wireless signal in your hotel room. Since we were on the third floor, it was kinda inconvenient. You must go to the lobby to use your laptop. During our stay, we like searching for local info online for things to do and restaurants. We also like to listen to music off our laptop (smooth jazz) in our room. It is not possible at La Tortuga. They have a lone computer in the lobby/bar/common area, but everyone is always trying to use it. If you get on it, you feel like someone is breathing down your neck for their turn, so hurry up. The music in the bar/lobby could use some help. They play the same new age in the day and Puerto Rican salsa tape in the evening. I would have loved to listen to some Mexican artists when in Mexico. We would play pool listening to their tired tapes... the bartender didn't have much of a personality. It was quite hot the week we were there, and they would not turn the ceiling fans on in the bar/lobby unless we asked them to. ??? The water pressure was not the strongest in the shower, and the temperture would change throughout our showers. The safety depsoit box is on the small side. Your laptop will not fit inside. We have stayed at other hotels in PDC that do have larger safety boxes that can accomodate ours. This one also has a key as apposed to the electronic combination style. There is a $1 per day charge to use the safety box, which seems a little silly, nickle & diming. It should just be included. The breakfast served was excellent! You get one hot drink choice, one cold drink choice, and one hot entree. We loved the huevos rancheros and chilaquiles the best. Some of the juices are not fresh squeezed. The hotel location is central, right at Calle Corazon. But it is 7 blocks north to Mamita's Beach Club, and then about 2 blocks east to get to the beach. It is a bit of a hike, and part of it is with the sun beating down on you. We would be sweating by the time we arrived at the beach. The problem with the beach club is that many hotels participate in letting their guests use Mamita's. Hotel guests are limited to the blue & white lounge chairs, on the southern part of Mamita's. It didn't seem like their were enough lounge chairs to go around, much less umbrellas. Many people seemed to get there and 'reserve' their lounge chair early by putting their towels on them, and coming back later. So after your sweaty trek to the beach, you have to battle it out for a lounge chair and umbrella. On Saturday's and Sunday's, it is packed. You not only have tourists, but the locals enjoying their day off. Good Luck getting a lounge chair. We ended up paying to use the one's considered Mamita's Lounge, and the price was different each time! We like boutique hotels. This one is acceptable. There was a problem with Silvia at the front desk not checking names and letting other guests take our van back to the airport. We were in the lobby right at 4pm, our pick up time, for a 7pm flight. We had also been using the shower in the pool area to get ready, and Jessica had helped us get started with that, so they knew were en route to the airport. The other guests bus (the kind that makes stops at a few hotels before heading to airport) came a few minutes later and she tried to get them to take us to the airport, but the girl told them she had others to collect and couldn't get us there in time. Good thing I understand spanish! They ended up putting us in a taxi. Then we ran into a horrible accident about 6 kilometers from the airport. 5 fatalities. 307 was a parking lot. After some time, all traffic started crossing over to the southbound side of the highway! It was very scary, especially in a little taxi. The driver had to get out to pull some sticks and brush from under the taxi. Then we had to cross back over through the ditch to the correct side again! 4 wheeling in a Mexican taxi! Boy did I wish we were in our van! We just barely made our flight home due to this mistake made by the hotel. We got major attitude from the airline personnel checking us in for being late. The only reason we made our flight was bcuz it was running 35 minutes late. Even with this incident, I would still recommend the hotel. We might even stay there again next year...but I think we might be happier a little further north and closer to the beach. We travel quite a bit, and we are not high mainteneance. This is a basic kind of place. If you are looking for a wow factor you won't find it here.

It really is very good and certainly one of the best I've ever had when compared to any hotel I've ever stayed in. My only issue had to do with noise. Maybe becuase we were on the ground floor, but the noise from the local disco continued every night we stayed until 4 am. I am a light sleeper and so the bass from the techno music kept me up most nights. Unfortunately, I couldn't wait to return to my home to get a good night sleep.

We had a very relaxing vacation at La Tortuga. We took the $8 ADO bus from the airport and the hotel was within walking distance (approx 10 min walk) I enjoued staying on 10th ave. In years past we stayed at hotels on 5th ave and this was a nice change of pace, a little quieter and really in the middle of it all. The common areas of the hotel and the pool are beatifully manicured, there were always people sweeping and cleaning to keep it this way. The pool area was nice to relax by especially at dusk when the lights begin to come on. The hot tub in the middle of the pool was very rejuvinating at the end of a hard beach day. The staff was friendly and helpful. We had a bit of a slow down on check in, there was a small problem findidng our reservation which made us a little nervous, we had paid in full through pay-pal before arriving. But soon the reservation was found and we were told our room would be ready in a half hour or so, even though it was only 5 -10 minuets before official check in time of 3:00. Not really a problem, we just went down to 5th Ave and had a margarita. Once we returned we we finished up our checking in process to find that a safe box although included in the room is an additonal charge of $1US a day if you actually want to use it. We began to fear a snownball effect of charges but this was indeed the only one we came across. Again not a big problem for sure but it would have been nice to know about this ahead of time. Juan Carlos helped us to our room with our baggage and showed us how to use the safe and a/c etc. Our room was pretty small although that is what I was expecting with a standerd room. If you travel with alot of cosmetics it can be tricky to find a place to put you things. I consider myself a pretty light traveler and I was doing a bit of juggeling. We had a small balcony with privacy but no real view, this was a nice suprise, I was not expecting a balcony. Outside of our room was a small common area which helped alleviate the size of the room. Thoughout the hotel the common areas were nicely designed, inviting and clean A/C works great when you need it, Mini frige in the room and one bottle of water.The bed was very comforatble, and the breakfast was great. With a ticket you pick up at the front desk every morning you recieve your choice of hot and cold drink and one plate off the menu. The mamitas beach pass was nice to have, one of the best beaches in town.(10-15 min walk) You have to get there early to get a palapa and by early I mean before 9am. We arrived at 9 thinking we were deffinately getting a palapa but we actually had barely made it and grabbed one of the last ones up. Food is available but after the first day we enjoyed food and drinks at the next door beach club restaurant Kool. A little more expensive but worth it. While I'm on the food topic try out Los Delicious while you are in Playa. I think this place has the best margarita (great pina colada too). The food is some of the best we had and suprisingly affordable with a friendly staff. Located on 5th ave & calle 22 Overall I would recomend La tourtuga to you highly, if you can afford an upgraded room I think it would be worth it.

I found La Tortuga solely by searching online and reading reviews.. reviews from THIS site and others. I chose the hotel because of what was already said by previous guests and it looked like a nice place with a good atmosphere and location. While some guests' reviews included complaints about construction noise, there was a constant theme of positive comments. Well here's MY review. Construction noise - It was a non-issue. Didn't hear or see anything (inside the hotel).. Playa as a town is growing rapidly so there's lots of construction elsewhere. The Room - We had a Standard Plus room with our balcony overlooking the pool ... 2 queens that at first felt firm but proved to provide some serious long sleeps (perhaps it was the long days of sun, heat and alcohol that assisted with the good sleeps too). A/C worked great! Our room had a good signal strength on the hotel's free wifi network so we could mess around on our laptops from our balcony. The pool and patios - not your average swimming pool.. it's a very creative custom designed pool like none other. The wood decking is very nice and the walk ways around the pools, patio and access to rooms is all very creative and well thought out! Patio loungers are comfortable for relaxing and reading however there isn't too much sun that get through the thick garden trees and greenery (it's kind of a tropical paradise at La Tortuga). The hot tub is nice and hot and the whole setting of the pool/patio at night is perfect.. they have the lighting set up very nicely. The restaurant - While there's plenty of good restaurants in Playa, the breakfasts at the hotel (included) were good (\"The Hot Bakery\" around the corner 20 steps is better for a few bucks) and the one dinner we had was very good (partly because the chef cooked the 53lbs Wahoo I had caught earlier that day ;-).. that's right.. 53lbs! The service - What can you say? This place is owned by a couple that cares and is run by people that perhaps care more. Little things are done well, the atmosphere is relaxed if you want to relax or fun if you wanna have fun! You can't match the service! Location - La Tortuga is just 2 blocks from arguably the busiest walking intersection in Playa (5th street and 12th avenue I think?.. the hotel is at 10th street and 14th avenue ... remember, avenues go in even numbers east/west and streets in 5s north/south). We were there for New Years and all I can say is that Vancouver Canada could learn a thing or two about street parties that are under control but out of control ... good times every time we ventured out... new years was over the top. Mamitas Beach Club - the beach was a packed!!!! I'm sure new years was the busiest time of year in Playa! Mamitas beach club (access included with your room) is very nice.. it's on the nicest part of the beach (IMO) and the food/drinks are tastey! We sat next to a local lawyer who said it's the best beach and nicest section of beach on the Mayan Riviera.. take THAT from a local. The schedule - to really feel Playa I'd recommend napping from 6PM - 9PM and then going for dinner and then out.. 5th street and the beach bars don't even get going until 9PM and midnight respectively. Would I go back? Without question!

The beach club Mamitas is great, but you need to get there by 8 or 9 in the morning to be sure that you have a spot under an umbrella. From the start the staff was extremely helpful. We arrived late at night, and they had complimentary champagne for us as they heard we were honeymooners. We had one of the new rooms recently built. It was absolutely gorgeous. There were some kinks since we were the first to use it, like the shower flooding. It is important to note, that the staff fixed it efficiently. There were also ants, but with an outdoor style hotel in a warm climate this is not unusual. We told them about it and the problem seemed to go away. Every hotel will have its problems once in awhile, our attitude was that if there response is helpful and effective then we have no complaints! The staff was very friendly and inquired often about our stay. We felt it was the perfect room for us, spacious, comfortable, and beautiful. It is very minimalist and modern. The breakfast is actually a great deal. You get your choice of espresso, type of eggs with refried black beans, and a big basket of whole grain bread. We found it would fill us until late in the day. Pedro booked our trip to Chichen Itza through the hotel. It was a long day, but worth the visit to the site. There are several side trips in the day, and my only complain about that was that it would have been nicer to spend more time in Vallaloid. Chichen ITza is an amazing monument and recommend everyone goes there. We also loved the following restaurants: Yaxche (we ate there the last night and wished we ate there EVERY night!), 100% natural (i am a vegetarian, and its a great place for healthy food) I would recommend La Tortuga to anyone, esp. people who want a romantic boutique hotel.", "Date": "January 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ashford", "Title": "\u201cI Loved the Omni\u201d", "Author": "boarville", "ReviewID": "UR6621357", "Content": "I stayed at La Tortuga in February 2006 and fell in love with the hotel.

They have put a jacuzzi in the middle of the garden with very hot bubbly water, great for relaxing at night, sipping wine. The restaurant is bigger and has more tables facing the garden - very beautiful setting for breakfast (included breakfast is great, eggs, cappuccino, fresh juice, and side orders for a little extra money). Most of the lounge chairs are around the pool under beautiful trees, so not much sun, but they are due to open a sundeck with large beds just a few steps up from the pool, so that will be great. I didn't stay in one of the new rooms but I did see a couple before leaving and they are fantastic! Big, very modern fittings, very clean. They all have their private jacuzzi.

We normally go for an on-the-beach location and had stayed in the now-closed El Faro in the past. With that option gone for now, we considered a variety of hotel options in Playa. Those included on the beach midtown (Playa Maya, Fusion, Alhambra) or on the north beach (Shangri La, Las Palapas) and off the beach midtown (Illusion, Basico, Deseo, Mosquito Blue, La Tortuga) or in north Playa (Riviera del Sol, Luna Blue). All had pluses and minuses. Looking for mid-to-upper-range quality and price, we chose La Tortuga and are very glad we did. Visits to all of our alternatives during our stay confirmed our good choice. The location proved to be great. We were around the corner from everything. While we missed not seeing the water out our window, we could actually see parts of it from our balcony high atop Tortuga. We greatly preferred Mamitas Beach Club (privileges come with staying at Tortuga) to the cramped beach scene midtown. Mamitas may have been the best beach scene we have ever experienced. Thus we did not mind the hotel\u2019s not being right on the beach. We were not troubled by traffic noise \u2013 the excellent AC drowned out most noise. Construction noise in the area is hard to avoid with so much building going on in Playa \u2013 a price of its growing popularity. We heard no Fifth Avenue or disco noise. The hotel itself is very attractive \u2013 a romantic hideaway. While the hotel\u2019s expansion construction is temporarily detracting somewhat from the beauty and peacefulness of the pool and courtyard, it is still lovely and should look even better in the near future. To be fair, they really should warn guests of this construction in advance of booking, since it really impacts on the quality of some of the rooms. The swim-up rooms have temporarily lost their luster until this work is done, and the current construction noise could be annoying. Our room, however, a junior suite with rooftop Jacuzzi, was a wonderful experience that I highly recommend. We spent a lot of time sitting on our porch soaking up the atmosphere and sunsets and in our hot tub just plain soaking. The beds were comfortable \u2013 not wickedly hard \u2013 and the bathroom was quite nice. The attached restaurant was perfect for breakfast, and the cozy bar met our happy-hour needs quite well. We also took advantage of the adjacent Spa Itza\u2019s facilities with great pleasure. Free internet access at the bar came in quite handy. Above all else, the key to La Tortuga is its staff. From Anna, who arranged for our stay by e-mail, to all the many smiling and helpful people at the front desk, the bar, the restaurant, and cleaning the rooms, the service was outstanding. We also availed ourselves of the $80 round-trip private van ride to the Cancun airport \u2013 another service plus that was worth every penny.

I found this hotel through reading reviews on Tripadvisor so pretty much I already knew what to expect. I wanted a small hotel with a more intimate experienc - not one of the large all inclusives - this hotel was perfect in that sense. Our first night our air conditioner broke and when we reported it the next morning, someone came right out and took care of it. We also had a clogged toilet during our stay and that also was taken care of immediately. The room was very small but quaint and well maintained. We loved the turn down service, though we only got it 2 out of the 5 nights we stayed, for what reason we don't know. The maid service was great, all staff very friendly. The bar kind of opens and closes whenever so you can't always count on getting a drink when you want but that wasn't a huge disapointment. The biggest disapointment was the construction. Throughout all of the reviews that I read, no one has mentioned the construction. I was so looking forward to laying around in that adorable courtyard without hundreds of other people around - as in other larger hotels - but you really couldn't because the construction was so loud. They are adding on to the hotel which is great, but I just wish I was notified about the construction - no one ever said a word about it, what we could expect, etc. Our swim up room was on the end closest to the construction so they were working only a foot away from us - it kind of took away from our whole experience. When I returned home, I received an e-mail from the hotel asking how my stay was and I told them I loved my stay besides my disapointment in the construction noise. When you save all year to go on vacation and plan to relax at your hotel and can't, it's a little disheartening. I did get a response right away with an apology and a wish that we will return after December - that is when the construction will be completed. So, if it wasn't for the construction, I guess the only thing that I could have asked for was a larger room - other than that, and the construction, it was great. We only did one tour while we were in Mexico. We planned on doing more but after what we did, I don't think anything could have topped it. We booked with Edventure Tours - they have a dive shop at the entrance of the Tulum Ruins. I found out about them through TripAdvisor. It is a married couple who own the business. Ed is from Mexico and Bonnie came to Mexico on vacation from the states some 10 years ago, they met and the rest is history. They provide personalized tour service either in your rental car, or you can pay them to use their car. The personalized service was wonderful - so much better than going on a tour with a bunch of other people. Ed picked us up at our hotel and took us back to the dive shop to get us fitted for our snorkel gear. Before we left to get started on our tour, my husband and I walked through Tulum on our own. When we were done, we met back up with Bonnie at the shop and started on our way. We did the zip line first, actually my husband did, I chickened out. Then we went to Hidden Worlds where we snorkled the cenotes. All I can say is wow. We have snorkeled in a few other places before, but never seeing anything like that . It was great. After the cenotes, we went to a bay in Akumal where we only saw two sea turtles because the surf was rough but heard that it is normally filled with turtles. Next we stopped for lunch at an adorable resturaunt on the beach in Akumal. By this time it was almost 5pm and we had one more stop - snorkeling in a lagoon which is like an aquarium with tons of fish. During lunch, we sat talking to Bonnie about our lives and she told us of one of her best friends who moved from the states to Mexico - as she did and just by chance has ended up running a Monkey Sanctuary with her husband. They take in who are discarded by their owners and others who are hurt by poachers. They nurse them back to health and take care of them as their own children - they have even had a birth of a new baby there. They bascially take care of the monkies from donations from visitors and revenue from renting out any one of the three homes - that they built - on their land surrounding the sanctuary which is out in the jungle. Well, once I heard about the monkies, I had to see them so we stopped at the lagoon and took some pictures and Bonnie drove us to The Jungle Place to meet her friends Heidi & Joel and to see the monkies. My favorite was Lady who had her baby Luna on her back and all the while she was reaching out to me putting her arm around me and patting me on my back. I fell in love. All I can say is that the visit with the monkies and spending time with Ed, Bonnie, Heidi & Joel was probably by best experience on a vacation my husband and I had ever experienced. I never would have expected spending the end of my tour in Mexico with my tour guides and their friends at thier home in the jungle surrounded by monkies having drinks and talking about our lives - all the while the newest baby - Maya is jumping back and forth from Heidi and Joel's laps. If you go to Mexico and want a tour - contact Bonnie at Edventure Tours - also, you will be doing yourself, and the monkies a great service if you visit The Jungle Place - it is an experience that you will never forget.

No problem, we just brought in our own, but had to buy ice across the street (it's cheap). Suggest bringing a small cooler for the room. No ice machine at the hotel. Free internet at the bar laptop was nice. Mamita's beach is the most popular and is crowded with mostly Italians or Mexicans - you either like that or hate it. Plenty of young beautiful people to watch, and a few families.

It became the joke that every evening before dinner we'd have to \"kill\" the swan (the towel sculpture on the bed) in order to take a shower. Every day, we'd go ask for towels, and they would bring them; the last day, we were just tired of the routine, so we just shared the towel from the sculpture. 2.

If you like expresso, Those are great to. Carlos makes an awesome lemonade, And Pina Colada in the resaturant. He is an excellent waiter. The tiramusu, And crepes for dessert, Are off the hook. The reataurant makes nice dinners also, And everything is made from scratch. The rooms are very nice, The beds are a little hard, And the towels al iittle rough, But all in all they are very cozy. The pool lounge couch area has lap top internet access, and at the bar they have a computer, Where you search the internet. The pool is nice a relaxing, Nothing to big, But just right. We took a trip to Tulum and saw all the big resorts on the way that are in the middle of no mans land, And your just confined to the resort area with no place to go. When you stay in Playa you are free to roam safe, And free in an all inclusive town with everything at your disposal. We stayed nine nights, And if I didn''t have to go back to work I would of stayed for a month.

We preferred the Tortuga. The people were nicer, service was better, the location is perfect, the pool was nicer, and it was half the cost even after paying for all of our meals. The Room was amazing. We stayed in the Jacuzzi suite which was a spacious loft with plenty of room, a rooftop terrace, and a flatscreen tv (it only got 10-15 mexican channels but it looked cool). Housekeeping kept it clean for us. They serviced our room everyday even when we didn't leave it till 3. They provided complimentary wine and floral decorations for our wedding (the Azul did not). The pool and bar area made us feel like \"this is where we belong\". Just look at the pictures and realize that they are all very representative of what the place is like... very relaxed, open, and inviting. We did have some services at the spa, namely a pair of hour-long massages that were the best we've ever had. I cannot say enough about Spa Itza. Absolutely Amazing. The beach club had the nicest beach I saw during my vacation. It was pretty far away, we walked there and always ended up taking a taxi back. We spent 10$ to have the use of a swinging bed for the day, it was well worth it. They waited on us all day long. We spent about $80/day on 2 beach beds on an amazing beach with non-stop cocktails and water lunch for 2 all at the newest/trendiest spot on the beach.... amazing. We also spent $50US for the 2 of us to be taken on a private snorkeling tour for a couple hours. This place offers a great deal of service and value for the price if you are willing to spend a little bit of money. WARNING - for those with children, Mamita's does have quite a few topless women. This was not a surprise or a problem for us, but it might be good to know.

I absolutely loved this hotel it is small, no kids under 15 allowed, the staff is fantastic & very personable. My friend and I stayed in room 305 which was very spacious, more than enough room for her 3 bags & my 2, it had doube queen beds and a rooftop \"jacuzzi\". The room was clean and had great air conditioning. Our balcony over looked the pool and since we were directly above the bar we were able to pick up the wirless internet access from our balcony. I do not know how they manage to keep the pool so cool but it was an incredible escape from the intense heat. (Here in Phoenix my pool feels more like a warm bath in the summer) The lounge by the pool is so inviting. The breakfast items that were free were limited but wasn't an issue for me since I rarely eat breakfast. Plus there is a bakery around the corner if you want a bigger selection. My only words of caution would be that there is construction going on nearby and it doesn't look like it will be done anytime soon so there is no sleeping in. I slept with my headphones on every night but it still woke me up. So you'll have to get up and go to the beach for some extra zzz's (there are worse things). Also the \"jacuzzi\" is more like a whirlpool and takes a while to fill up. I would absolutely stay here again.

They are putting in flat screen tv's in all the rooms, and upgrading the grounds. The staff is unbelievable. We feel like we are at home everytime we stay there - everyone knows our names and treats us like family. At the front desk, Bernardo is always helpful and accomodating. Anna - you know we love you.

The breakfast is great and filling, and the beach passes really help. The beach is beautiful and I think it's actually bigger and wider since the hurricane. We spent all our days there. Just a bit of advice: don't bother with taxis and shuttle busses from the airport. Its a waste of money. Take the bus. When you walk out of the airport, head to your right and you'll see the huge ADO busses. They leave every 30 minutes, have air-conditioning, really comfortable, and cost about $8 per person. And it will not take you much longer to get to Playa on the bus then it will on the shuttle. The bus makes 2 or 3 stops, but the shuttle has to drop other people off as well. Overall, La Tortuga is the place to be. It has charm and character. The hotel is spotless clean, and has the most memorable people working there. The service La Tortuga provides is very hard to find elsewhere. As long as we visit Playa, we will never stay anywhere else.

You can close the windows but if you like to sleep with open windows it's pretty hard. Another noise factor, for European visitors, is the following: as around 50% of the guests are from the US/Canada, they can be pretty loud and you might not be used to people talking at the top of their voice in the garden or in the lobby at any time of day or night like the average american does..I was woken up by some of these people once.

We went to Coco Maya, which we had been to before, but it was very nice to have the passes so we didn't have to pay the extra money for the beachchairs ($3-5 if your not staying at La Tortuga) Mamitas beach was always too packed and was always much windier than Coco Maya. We both played pool every night, pool table was fine, maybe bring your own cue if you like to play. Maid service and turndown service was great, very attentive and thorough. It was nice to have clean sheets everyday. Also nice to have internet, one less errand to run during the day, very convenient. Nice bar area, Bernardo, Luis and Pedro are all very good hosts. Pedro took our laundry to have it done for us! That saved us some time as well. Andrew said the only thing he could think of that would have been nice is to have the beer included during happy hour.

The hotel was wonderful, both from a service standpoint, and the beautiful, relaxing atmosphere it provided. I would highly recommend a swim-up room, not only because you can step onto your patio and jump right into the small but cute pool, but also, because these rooms offer great people-watching at the bar, which is next to the pool (which closes at 11 P.M.,for those of you concerned about noise). The beach club, Mamitas, is excellent, with its rustic, traditional thached-palapa side, as well as the ultra-modern, sophisticated techno music infused \"Euro Banana-Hammock\" side. The food at the beach is also good, notably the grilled shrimp and ceviche. There are only two minor complaints: Hotel La Tortuga isn't far from a place tha plays live music really late at night--that or it's very close to a garage band who likes to practice Black Sabbath's \"Paranoid\" (poorly, too) at 2:30 in the morning on occasion. But, this only happened once or twice. Secondly, the air condidioners in the room are loud and poorly laid out, which actually helped drown out the Black Sabbath music, at the expense of having the dry, cold air shooting directly at us in bed. Everything else about this hotel will exceed your expectations, including the complimentary breakfast at Agora. Must try: Cappuccino at Agora that was as good as any that I have had in Italy. If you aren't into all-inclusives, and are more interested in botique-type hotels (like my wife and I), you will love La Tortuga.

I have always had a good experience with them. Unfortunately, although the website portrays few problems post Wilma, there are still a few. First, there are still repairs ongoing to the upper floors of the hotel (with equipment starting at 8AM) to some of the rooms). I don't know when these will be completed, but this is my second day and as I write I hear both electric equipent and manual sawing and hammering quite clearly. Also, Mamita's, the beach resort, although scheduled to be open november 15, will not be open for several weeks (maybe mid december). While this is not the hotel's fault, they have not yet arranged for another beach club and the website still shows Mamitas as an amenity. Had I known this, I would have gone somewhere else. Not because the hotel is not a nice one, but because the absence of Mamitas means that you will not have anywhere in particular to go on the beach (no beach loungers or umbrellas, no beachside drink service etc.) - the hotel will still give you a towel, but that is it. If you don't mind just plopping down on the sand with your towel and bringing your own drinks down to the beach or getting drinks at the beach restaurants (there are not as many as you would think), then you won't mind this too much. But, Mamitas was a very nice club and made this hotel a great bargain because it was both close to Calle 5 without being noisy and also had a very nice beach club that involed a minimum hassle, except the walk over. They are trying to find another beach club to use until Mamitas is back together, but you should check on this before booking because the hotel only has six beach loungers by the pool and once they are taken by guests there is only a small patch of rough grass to put down a towel on. That being said, any other time I have been here, this has generally been a really nice place to stay, which is why I have come back several times. The addition of wireless is a plus to a hotel that is already a good value for playa. Also, when I told them that I would be cutting my reservation short (from 9 days to 4 days) because I wanted to go to a hotel with beach chairs and services for part of my stay, the woman at the front desk (who has always been very pleasant) waived the 1 day cancellation fee because I was a repeat customer. Although the man at the desk was not very pleasant regarding the cancellation - this is the first time in four visits that I have been unhappy with the way I was treated by the staff and as I think you will see from most of the reviews, that they are generally very friendly and helpful. The bottom line is that this hotel is an excellent value for playa with a good location and nice amenities, albeit offsite at Mamita's.

The attached restaurant is fabulous, you get breakfast included with your stay-so take advantage of it. Very fresh and delicious. The only, and I mean the ONLY semi-complaint we would have is the distance to the Beach Club Mamitas. Yes it is nice when you get there, but be prepared for a little bit of a walk. Of couse we are being petty-I mean we should love to get out and have a walk to the beach for heavens sake, but if the beach were right outside the door-this place would REALLY be heaven on earth.....

I heard nothing but horror stories at the airport on the way back from guests at other locations on how they were treated by their hotel or resort. Bernardo and everyone took care of my wife and me. They went above and beyond what I would expect of hotel professionals. I can not say enough about how the entire staff treated us during the crisis. That alone would give the hotel 5 stars on any review. But for those who want to know about the hotel during calmer times I say, stay nowhere else when visiting Playa.

I have to give it absolutely the best rating possible, 20 on a scale of 1 to10. We spent a lot of time researching hotels in the area and read through all the reviews on Trip Advisor regarding this hotel. Going to a different country was a little intimidating and picking out a hotel from the internet was nerve wracking but we didn\u2019t want to go to just any big resort. If we were traveling to Mexico, we wanted to experience a little local flavor. The hotel staff, Anna especially, was fabulous and quickly put to rest any fears we had regarding our hotel choice. They answered question after question for me in preparation of our arrival. I felt like I knew them before we arrived. The room they suggested was perfect, exactly what we were looking for and exactly as they described, everything was very clean and tastefully decorated. The rooftop Jacuzzi/terrace was a wonderful amenity. The sunrise from our terrace was fabulous. The tub does take a little while to fill but well worth the wait and not so much time that it was annoying as had been mentioned in previous reviews. The hotel courtyard is almost like your own little paradise. The pool was wonderful and very refreshing. The maid staff was great and had the room beautiful for our arrival, rose petals and fresh flowers were everywhere and a bottle of wine chilling for us. Breakfast at Agora, the restaurant at the hotel, was incredible. There was more food than I could eat but I suggest you also try the fruit with yogurt plate also. It is very reasonably priced and the mango is the best you will ever try. The location was perfect, within walking distance of everything you needed. The noise, mentioned in previous reviews, was never a problem for us. Our room seemed very private and quiet. The beach club, Mamita\u2019s was one of the best on the beach. The walk there was not too far. The food and drinks were great. They served us our food right on the beach at our palapa. There was a computer at the hotel bar available for checking e-mails for those travelers that need to check in with the real world. However, be prepared to want to drop all contact with the outside world once you enter the doors at La Tortuga. If you are looking for a place to get away from the cookie cutter, all inclusive resort, but don\u2019t want to feel completely secluded, you can\u2019t go wrong with Hotel La Tortuga.

That was too long for me to wait so I tried to split a ride with some other family taking the 45 minute drive. A half hour later I found a couple and wound up spending $25.00 to get to the hotel (much better than $60 that was quoted by taxis if I left alone). When I arrived, the employee told me that I would be reimbursed if I provided the receipts. I did so the following day and I made sure that I would have a transfer back. I reminded them every day. I was told that the taxi company never confirmed their reservation and that's why no one came for me. It was too late to go to the party so I went straigt to sleep. My girlfriend had become worried when I didn't show so when she came to look for me and asked if I had checked in a new overnight guy was there and told her that I wasn't in that hotel!
