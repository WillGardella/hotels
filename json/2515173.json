Anyway, for the Left Bank, it is up the hill from Maubert-Mutualite metro stop. I toured the city using Metro. Had about 6 stations on TV. The clean up room fine. Elevator tiny. Stairs otherwise a climb. About 5 stories total. If you search harder, you might find something better for the money. One internet working in lobby. Night staff vary. They shut down around 2 am. Breakfast same thing daily so get it as a part of deal, do not pay extra. Go hear only if you can get the $99 a night for 3 night deal. You could probably find another Left Bank hotel a bit better if you have time. Very close to Parthanon and Sorbonne. About 10 min from Notre Dame. Some side streets filled with Eurotrash drinking til 3 am by Notre Dame. This neighborhood is generally quiet. Nice restaurant on corner that makes an effort locally. Another Italian place right down street with neon signage that is reasonable priced. For $50 you get a hostel with shared shower.

We chose the hotel based upon Tripadvisor reviews, the location of the hotel and the fact that they could provide us with a triple room. Upon our arrival, we were met by a very friendly (and unbeknownst to us, comedic) gentleman at the front desk. We confirmed that we had a triple room and he said \"yes\". My girlfriend proceeded to ask him if we had a balcony and he replied in his lovely French accent that we didn't and that we had a very small window. The naive crew that we were, shrugged our shoulders, said \"oh well\" and felt just thankful we each had our own bed. Due to the fact that the elevator is the size of a tiny closet, we each had to go up by ourselves with our suitcase. And when I say small, I mean small. Like nothing you've ever seen before. But it added to the charm of the hotel and what did we care, we were without our children!! As we entered the room, not only were we met with a beautiful QUADRUPLE room we had them most fabulous balcony on the top floor of the hotel. There were no words. We just laughed and jumped up and down like a bunch of 12 year olds. Enough of that, the remainder of the review is as follows. It is not a Hyatt. It is a French boutique hotel. If you can wrap your brain around this, you will thoroughly love it. You truly feel like you're in Paris. The breakfast is perfect. Nothing hot but beautiful croissants and baguettes.

We arrived via Gare du Nord and the nearest metro station was just 2 stops [St Michel] away. The hotel was easy to locate and was very conveniently situated in a nice area near close to Notre Dame. The main open top bus tour stop was nearby and metro/boat trips were easily accessible. There were plenty of shops and restaurants in the immediate vicinity. Check in was quick. All staff were friendly that we encountered. Our room and bathroom were very clean. The room rate was reasonable and we booked this on the basis of the inclusive breakfast to help manage our costs. The negatives. Our room was very small. There was not much space to store our belongings. Yes, it's Europe, yes we expected the room to be small but we have stayed in many rooms and this was one of the smallest we have ever stayed in. It was literally a bed against the wall with a gap on one side to get in and out. It was a bit difficult to get ready to go out together due to the limited area to change. We did get the balcony we had requested which was nice but not particualrly functional with just one chair and no real space to move. Maybe we should have asked for a larger room but we were tired on arrival and didn't plan to spend too much time in there, so it didn't really bother us to make a fuss but it might bother some. We did glance at the room next door and it was a good 50% bigger. It was Room 55. Breakfast choice was limited. What was on offer was good, especially the bread, proper butter and cheese. It was sufficient but there was no fresh produce and we would have liked to see fruit and meats available. If we had paid 9.80 Euro each we would have been hugely disappointed with what was on offer.

Hotel Claude Bernard may not be the only wheelchair friendly hotel in Paris but we always try to avoid the big chains and the faceless, characterless so-called style of the Hiltons and Sheratons of this world. What we found was friendly staff who coped with my limited French and provided a room that could take all three of us. This was a cheaper option than one room for Anna and another for us. The non-wheelchair room was some floors away. We had a single for Anna and a double for us. The provided room was fine for the three of us for a limited time. It was on the ground floor and the windows opened directly onto the street, which meant we had to draw the curtains for the afternoon siesta. Hardly a problem as the windows were sound-proofed. Paris is full of old hotels, many of which have limited space and limited capacity for lifts. The idea of a room in one such hotel with a \"drive-in\" shower space was ideal for us. What was missing was something like a special chair for the shower (a \"commode chair\") but there were safety rails aplenty. I would recommend this hotel to a wheelchair user or for anyone travelling with a wheelchair user.

I was feeling ok, so I happily left my luggage in the hold room and skipped off to enjoy my first day in Paris as I didnt want to waste it waiting around. In fact I enjoyed it so much, I didnt return until 16:30 after walking all about. I was tired and really ready to settle in for a shower. When I returned the gentleman who I met earlier seemed a bit confused and he told me there was an issue with my room. I begged him to just give me another room and I can swap the next day. He told me if I came earlier there would be no issue as a man came before me. So i asked him if he gave my room away? He told me no, it was an issue with the shower and it is not their policy to allow me to stay. They organised another hotel, the hotels neighbouring (3-4star) were full. I didnt bother to check. I accepted it and pushed my luggage down the 2-3 blocks to Hotel Diana 2star. I was a little annoyed when i realised it was 2 star. At Hotel Diana there was a charming and very fluent english speaking man named Damian who asked me what the problem was. I went on to tell him they had an issue with my shower. He politely smiled and told me that was a lie, but a man called before stressed bc they booked a man last minute into my room. I figured that sounded more like it. I asked the gentleman to call back to Hotel Claude Bernard St germain to confirm in french with the man that I was not to pay for this night @ Hotel Diana NOR pay for the night at all as this was their error. Also that the hotel was to pick up my belongings and check it in the following day where I was leaving early to go to the Louvre for the day. This was confirmed so I knew there was not to be a mix up. I was told to just have breakfast at Hotel Diana and leave for the louvre the next day and on return go back to Hotel Claude St Germain where everything will be organised. The next day I left my luggage in the lobby and was met by a lovely lady at hotel Diana for breakfast. She also asked me what the mix up was. I told her the hotel said it was an issue with the shower. She said NOOOO... they called and said they made a mistake and she thought it was unfair and she didnt want me b/c I was expecting a higher star rating and it was not fair on me to get a 2 star and her only roomleft was her worse room. I told her Hotel Diana was fine and I was happy that even though they made a mistake they are looking after me.. she warned me to ensure I was not paying for the night at all! After my day at the louvre I checked in with the same man from the day before at Hotel Claude B St G. I checked TWICE with him that I was not paying for the night before (not paying the rate of his hotel or the other) and that he was covering my breakfast for the error. He said yes, yes. Dont worry and apologised. He also said he was giving me a better room - which i dont think it was better than what I booked but it was clean and I didnt mind or bother. From that point I didnt mind. I thought: hey they made a mistake, but they are looking after me so fine! The rest of my stay was pleasant. The breakfast was good. THe rooms were clean. It was on check out. Luckily I decided to check out 3 hours early so I could do some last minute trip to the shops and then catch my afternoon train to London. On checkout I realised i was being charged 86euro for the night at Hotel Diana. I was furious bc the manager Paul was called and he said there was \"no way I would NOTbe charged for it. It was unheard of!\" I was to wait 1 hr when he would come down to speak to me. I went down to Hotel Diana hoping to catch Damian who was the french man who confirmed my no charge for the night. Unfortunately his shift did not begin until 15:00. But i checked the rate of the room was 78euro but breakfast was 8euro and I was getting charged that. (so much for free breakfast) On return for the hotel the manager was still on his way but decided out of \"generosity\" that they would only charge 50euro... I was livid, but decided to wait for Paul and head out to do what I planned to do for the morning. WHen I eventually met up with Paul there was lots of arguing. They used the excuse of the other man not being fluent in english... I got it confirmed in FRENCH mate!! I may be a small young woman, but I am educated and do not like being bullied by such an arrogant manager as Paul who does not honour what his employees say to their clients and tried to say how his hotel found me a pleasant place and i stayed there and survived, like it was a gift for me! You can see from his \"poor review\" replies that he is always returning the blame to the client. I laughed at some that I have read just before writing this. His replies always seems to have an air about making the reivewer come across like they are really fussy, real whingers and complainers. FYI-I am pretty cruisey. I was willing to let the first day all go if I was taken care of. There would have been no complaints even though I was shipped off to a 2 star for the night, made to grab my luggage and lug it down the street - something the hotel should have offered to handle! After a lot of raised voice, poor words, I gave in and demanded they just print out the statement so I can pay and leave!! This was wasting my time! I was livid!! Paul some how came to his senses (maybe after i kept threatening to write horrible reviews on trip advisor) and decided that I was leaving on such a bad note and unhappy he didnt like that so took off the charge. But not before ensuring that by taking off the 1st night charge, I would leave \"happy\" and not write a bad review. Sure thing Paul! So I thank the Hotel ever so much for taking off the 1st nights fee at the pleasant Hotel Diana! It was such a generous touch! I hope the hotel takes this as a learning curve & ensures their staff don't say yes yes when they dont mean it, or if they do the manager says \"oh well he shouldnt have agreed to it, but bc he has, I will honour it\"... or maybe just DONT give out a pre-booked room to the next guy who will pay a greater rate!?!?!?

We booked superior double rooms to ensure we had enough space. Due to our travel arrangements, our husbands arrived at midday, and we (the wives) arrived at 7pm. Imagine our dismay when we saw the rooms -- a double bed up against the wall, with just enough space to walk on one side of the bed, over to the window. The bathroom was just big enough for one person (barely); there was not enough room to put two suitcases in the room without laying them on top of each other. We visited reception, and while very friendly, said that they thought it was only the men checking in as singles (despite printed and emailed booking requests) as they turned up earlier than us. They promised to move us in the morning to the superior room, as soon as others checked out, as they were fully booked. Fair enough, mistakes happen, so we packed up our things to make sure we were ready to go the next day. The next morning we went out for a while after breakfast, then came back at lunchtime to make sure that we were changing rooms (the other couple had messaged us to say that they had just been changed to a room 1.5 times the size). So off we dashed, back to the hotel to move to our new room -- oh sorry, they 'forgot' that we were supposed to move, we should have reminded them again, and sorry, they were fully booked out again. Not impressed. Finally on the third morning, with many, many reminders, they moved us to a new room. The new room was much better, although they gave us two twin beds instead of a double. By that stage I really was over trying to get the room fixed, so we put up with it. Now after all of this, at check out we were charged the same price for the tiny room as we were for the superior room -- ie charged at the higher rate for something we didn't get. I was quite unimpressed, and it left a little bit of a sour taste in my mouth. It was the only poor experience we had in Paris, a truly beautiful, friendly city. So my advice is to make sure you are really clear about your booking before you arrive, particularly in the 24 hours before when the rooms are allocated -- if you make sure that this is clear, then I would recommend the ho0tel.

I had a single, which was understandably small, but I saw many of the other rooms as well, including the triples on the first floor that are accessible to the disabled, and the family rooms. As for my single, it had a double bed and I slept very well. Nothing fancy, but there was a functional desk of rustic style, and good sized wardrobe, and an ensuite shower/w.c. The shower was small, as expected in an old building coverted to ensuite units, but the use of a curtain instead of doors made it more comfortable than the hotels that use those folding doors. Some of the other rooms that I saw had bathtubs and larger bathrooms. The hotel is very well located. Two metro stops are within easy walking distance. The Musee Cluny is a few blocks away. Several main bus lines run past it, or nearby. Many restaurants are in the area (go down to rue St. Germain and eat at Twickenhams for a good inexpensive meal), as are all the amenities you could need. Most rooms have a refridgerator. Most also have room safes. If yours does not, there are extra safes in a room on the first floor that you can use. The hotel was pretty full when I was there, and the hot water held out for me even so. I had no complaints at all about cleanliness, and I am picky. Towels were changed daily. The hotel is always being maintained. The rooms appear freshly decorated, and not at all worn. The desks are deliberately country/rustic, not worn and nicked. They painted the reception area while I was there, in the evenings, and it did not even look like it needed painting to me. The staff at the desk are extremely helpful and willing to give directions on how to get to various places. I even called while I was out once to get directions. The staff went out of their way to check our plane times, and to find out the status of the train to the airport, and when one metro line was being shut for maintenance, etc. I can not speak too highly of them. Some of the rooms have great charm. The family rooms in particular are very large, and the ones on the second and fifth floor have walk out balconies (as do all the rooms facing the street on those floors.) I also faced the street, but was not bothered by street noise. I had some young people in the room next to mine a few nights, and while I could hear them talking it was not as if the walls were thin. They were very young and they talked a bit louder than adults is why I heard them. The breakfast room in in the basement, but it is a typical tourist class hotel breakfast room. The croissant and baguettes were fresh, the coffee not bad, the bit of cheese welcome. It is a continental breakfast and more than adequate on that count. There is also cereal and yogurt. If you want eggs etc, go to the above mentioned Twickenhams on your way out and about. It is getting harder to find hotels in the big cities that are managed by owners instead of hired staff, but this one appears to be. There is pride of ownership very visible here, in my opinion. No chipping plaster or paint, inside or out. No walls showing years of cigarette smoke. If you have been in a tired tourist hotel in Europe, you know what I mean. This one is not like that. It is an independent hotel, not too large, with a very European feel to it. A few quirks here and there, but that is how you know you are not in a Hilton or Day's Inn. Paris has those if you want them. As indicated in other reviews, the lift is tiny. Two people max, without luggage. Put the bags in and walk up to meet them if you can. Otherwise take it slowly, one person and luggage at a time. Most people walk the stairs, though, and I never had a long wait for the elevator when I needed to use it. One complaint, and one only. The wifi is unreliable. It is weak and spotty. I am not sure it is the hotel's issue or that of the network they are on.", "Date": "March 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cDirty and dissapointing\u201d", "Author": "dalec1980", "ReviewID": "UR58134424", "Content": "Very dissapointed with this hotel- and like the previous reviewer, im surprised with the positive reviews.

The hotel's rooms are bright and clean, with sizable baths and good closet space, as well as a very useful min-fridge for storing fruits and cheeses for picnics and late night snacks. ( A Monoprix store is around the corner and ahandy place to pick up sandwiches, salads, wine, etc if you don't want to eat out for every meal. We also enjoyed going to the street markets on the next block Sat. ,Tues., and Thurs., to get wonderful fruits, pastries, wines, as well as mustards etc that became gifts for friends at home.) Another benefit is the free wi-fi available throughout the hotel as well as a computer room with three desktops and a printer for guests' use - very convenient, especially for checking in for a flight before heading to the airport. Daily continental breakfast included lots of fresh bread and croissants and good coffee - a nice way to start the day with the help of very friendly staff in the kitchen. One note - if you have trouble with stairs, be aware that the breakfast is served a floor below the lobby and, if breakfast is included with your room rate, you'll have stairs to climb daily. The hotel is located on a busy street in the Latin Quarter and you will have street noise, loud on the weekends, if you have a front room. We loved the big windows and balconies and street activity, and soon got used to the noise. The front desk staff could not have been more helpful or responsive to our inquiries and requests. Though we had no problem taking the inexpensive RER train from CDG airport to the hotel on arrival (be prepared for some serious walking!) they helped us reserve an excellent shuttle service to take us and our heavier bags back to our airport terminal for the trip home. The Hotel Claude Bernard is not grand or fancy by Parisian standards, but a lovely old hotel, nicely updated, with a great deal of dignity and charm. It offers great value at reasonable cost, and if you're like us, and would rather spend your money on other things Paris has to offer, then this will definitely be a place for you!", "Date": "October 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "houston", "Title": "\u201cOur room was great, the staff went out of their way to help, location fabulous\u201d", "Author": "nolasoccermom", "ReviewID": "UR45540923", "Content": "We had a fabulous stay!

Our family of 5 booked the family room on the third floor which consisted of a queen bed and two singles, plus the rollaway (for which they did not charge). Whilst spacious there was little room left for leaving suitcases out. The decor was a little dated but had charm. The room could have done with a little TLC: - knobs were missing off bedside tables, a light globe was out, the TV remote control required batteries and there was nowhere to hang a roll of toilet paper. All minor things. Towels however were fantastic, very generous. Concierge were helpful and friendly prior to our stay and during our stay. We were pleased they accepted a deposit and not the full amount prior to arrival. When the bank took 30 euro from the amount I transferred for the deposit, they graciously offered to split the charge and not ask for the full amount. The lift is claustrophobic and can only fit one person combined with one suitcase or two suitcases on their own at a time. For those looking for the breakfast room please be aware it is underground. Unfortunately, we weren't advised as such when we arrived. However, once we did make the discovery, we enjoyed the usual croissants, jams and coffee. A computer for free internet use is available on the 1st floor, but again we only found out it was there when we asked about internet availability. This hotel is well located and there is plenty around the general area. Pharmacy, ATM and stores such as Monoprix all within a five minute walk. For 50 Euros you could hire a van which fit five of us plus all our bags to get us to Gare du Nord station (15 minutes by car of an early morning). The metro is a good 10 minute walk as was the bus stop for the Le Open Bus Tour (located opposite the Notre Dame). For a family situation, this hotel was excellent value.

My husband and I stayed at HCB from June 22 to June 25, 2008 and had a reasonably enjoyable stay. The HCB was located slightly off of a main street, but we were able to find it with our map in hand \u2013 not far from the subway station at all. I did not have high expectations for the HCB as it is rated (in most books and web sites) as a three-star hotel. The lobby is a little worn and dated, but is spacious and provides room for lounging if desired. Our check-in was very quick and easy and the staff were very friendly and helpful with making dinner reservations for us at a few restaurants some friends had recommended. Our room was on the third floor, so we did not mind our climb up the winding staircase too much (except one day when we kept forgetting things in our room and had to go back up and down a few times before heading out for the day). We did not attempt to use the small lift as it looked to be more cumbersome to use than just climbing the stairs. We had booked a double room and were a little horrified at first to see our room was literally equipped with only a double bed for the two of us. We\u2019re not used to sleeping on such a small bed, but it actually did not turn out to be a problem as we were both quite tired at the end of each day and had no trouble falling to sleep (the copious amounts of red wine helped as well ; )\u2026). The room was quite small, but standard for Paris, with a desk and chair and a small wall-mounted television. Our room was very clean and well-maintained. We were able to control the air conditioning in our room and it worked extremely well. There was one window which we could open if desired, but our view was only of the building next door across a small alleyway \u2013 we had no balcony. This didn\u2019t concern us too much though as we spent most of our time outside on cafes anyway. My only real problem with our room in the HCB was the bathroom \u2013 so tiny! The shower stall had shower curtains as walls which made it very difficult to maneuver under the trickle-spray. I have to say I was not able to shave my legs in the shower during our three nights at HCB \u2013 sorry Honey!!! Breakfast was included in our stay each morning, and was a nice touch. Juice, hot chocolate, yogurt, cereal, croissant, baguettes, cheeses \u2013 a good start to our days in Paris. Just down the street from HCB we discovered La Petite Perigourdine, a small restaurant/caf\u00e9. My husband would sit on the patio and have espresso each morning and we had dinner there twice. The staff were quite friendly (although my husband speaks French, so I don\u2019t know if they would be as friendly to the Anglophones), and the meals were excellent and quite reasonably priced. For approximately 65Eur, we had an appetizer to share, two entrees (lamb and steak tartar), dessert to share and a bottle of nice red wine. I don\u2019t know that I would recommend Hotel Claude Bernard to friends, as I haven\u2019t stayed in other similarly priced hotels in Paris to compare.

We did a lot of research into our hotels, which were booked by a travel agent, and we thought the Bernard was very nice based on the pictures from the internet. Boy, were they misleading. I arrived alone the first night, very late, on a much-delayed flight from Heathrow to find only one staff member on duty and he spoke absolutely no English. As a single woman who travels frequently, I have become accustomed to having help with my bags but no such luck here. After I stuffed myself and all of my heavy bags into the tiny lift, (Thank goodness for a lift), I went upstairs to a hallway that was completely dark to fumble around and find my room, which was totally unacceptable. It was dirty, smelled of smoke, the bathroom shower was moldy and the electrical wires and sockets were hanging out of the walls. I immediatly went downstairs and told the man I could not stay in that room and after using hand gestures for 30 minutes he finally moved me to another room down the hall from the original one. However, there wasn't a key for the room that he was moving me to so he gave me the master key to all of the hotel rooms. How scary is that? Thankfully for all of the other guests, I am not a mass murder pychopath. My second room wasn't any better, but I was exhausted so I toughed it out and slept on top of the covers, in my clothes and prayed that the next day would be better. The next day I spoke to one of the managers and he agreed to move me to a much nicer room on another floor as soon as it was clean. I felt so relieved. My friend made it in that morning and the manager had us leave our luggage with him and he ensured us that by the time we made it back that afternoon, we would already be moved to our new room, which he even gave us the number to. After sightseeing all day, we made it back to find only the French-speaking employee on duty. We stopped to get our room key and he obliged, however, they had put us in the original room they had put me in from the night before with the smoky smell and the sockets hanging out, which was not the room the manager had promised. I was so angry I insisted he call the manager, who spoke Enlish and he apologized that they had given our other room away. Keep in mind we had reservations at the hotel months in advance. At this point I tried to find other rooms in Paris but the rugby cup had them full-up. We decided to tough it out for our remaining days, unhappily, and didn't bother to inform them that I am a writer and they will be recieving some scathing reviews in certain travel mags. Anyways, one night as we got ready to go out, I attempted to plug my converter into an eletrical outlet only to get quite a bad shock because someone had broken their plug off in the outlet and my hand brushed up against it unknowingly. You would think hotels would check for this stuff...when we let them know what had happened, (my friend said smoke came out of the outlet and off of my hand when it happened) the manager didn't really believe us and went up to check it out. He came back looking bewildered, and he too had been electrocuted by the bad plug. Our last day in the hotel, as we waited for our driver, the owner came in and apologized profusly (too late) for all of our troubles and offered us a nice bottle of wine to make up fo it. (Way too little.) He also promised that rennovations were to begin that morning on the two rooms we had been imprisoned to on our stay. To be fair, there were other people there who seemed to really enjoy their stay with the Bernard, but I have to think they had no idea what a nice hotel should be like and how bad they were getting screwed for their money's worth. The only good thing about the hotel is its location is so convenient.

When we came down for breakfast the table was nearly empty and the staff did not hurry to replace missing items. ( Which was a disappointment because they charge 10 euro for breakfast). The day we checked out they did not give a wake up call (which caused us to miss our train back to London) and at checkout we were still charged for the larger room we had booked.

At 9am the following morning, the receptionist told us to return to The Claude Bernard to have breakfast. After carting our bags back to the Hotel, we were then told that our room would not be available till noon as the occupants had not yet checked out. It transpires the story of the 'hot water' was just that, a story and the reason we were 'unceremoniously' dumped across the road was due to one of their 'frequent' over-booking policies. The surly man on reception was downright rude and said if we didn't like it we could go and find somewhere else to stay! If this is the hotels policy then I don't see how anyone can risk booking in advance to then be given sub-standard accommodation at the same price and no apology!

Reading the reviews, coupled with my own experience and the good reports from a good friend, I think this hotel might be hit and miss. It's larger than many of the typical hotels in Paris so there always seem to be rooms available here when they're hard to find elsewhere, which is a good thing if you need a place to stay. However I wonder if that's because there are some bad rooms here, as has been my experience. It's an OK place for the price, and it felt like a bargain a few years ago before the USD slid. It's nothing fancy, has a very generic vibe and gets a wide range of visitors from large family groups to shopper girls to singles. First stay I had a single room for a week, the teensiest room ever. Bed against two walls with about 1 foot to the window and about 2 foot wide walkway between the fourth side of the bed and the tiny desk. There was no place from which to view the little wall-mounted TV comfortably except if I sat at the inner corner of the bed where the walls met, and even then I had to crane my neck uncomfortably. At least they had TV5 on their cable back then and there were lots of French runway fashion programs! Every morning at 7am I could hear the woman in the next room having her daily half hour conversation with her husband back home. That ensured I got an early start each and every day, like it or not. Also had the teensiest bathroom with a shower not much more than 24\" square in plan. Great water pressure and temperature, though. Staff was friendly, genuinely so, helpful, and it was great that they spoke English. They seemed like college students perhaps. Breakfast was always nice in the sunny, windowed room. A nice environment in which to begin the day. Orange juice from concentrate, decent coffee, average croissants if there were any left, yogurt, American-style cereal and milk, cheese square packets. I heard they offered eggs but nobody said a thing to me about it and I didn't ask. I met an American writer there who was staying there for 3 weeks. Pretty good location near useful Metro stop. Note that you have to transfer to get to the department stores so don't buy too much to bring back with you or have them send it to the hotel for you! (Also I try to avoid transferring at Chatelet because it's a nightmare.) Second stay I had a room on an upper floor at the end of the hall for 3 nights. It was a double room this time and it was typical Paris size, not super small like the first room. However I could hear something in the adjacent building all night long. Sounded like an elevator running sporadically, or a washing machine. I really should have asked to move after the first night but I thought it might be a one-night thing. Wrong. My mistake for not asking to move because I couldn't sleep well at all during my time there. The cable selection was not so great this time: No TV5 any longer, luckily two or three French channels (one of which showed very old shows from the US!), but mostly channels from Middle Eastern countries with lectures, reading of the Koran, and panel discussions that are interesting only for a short while if you don't speak the language because there aren't any visuals to give you context or meaning. At first I thought that might have been because of the customer preference but then I saw mostly Asian and European customers on that visit. The bathroom with tub/shower was typical in size however the floor and tub felt grimy. I suspect that the hotel just does not clean rooms as regularly or meticulously as they should. The soap amenities were super cheap and very drying, and were clearly downgraded since my earlier visit. On this visit the coffee was now being made and dispensed from a mini vending machine contraption and the quality was definitely inferior to that of my first visit. Decent coffee is a big thing for me and a dealbreaker, so going someplace else for breakfast would be a necessity for me. Breakfast setup was otherwise the same and otherwise acceptable. The staff was friendly but since I didn't ask about room relocation I don't know how amenable they would have been. Perhaps there are less desirable rooms here that remain unoccupied some of the time and they don't take such good care of them? Or maybe the larger, family sized rooms are maintained better? Just a hunch I have, because there seem to be some good rooms here but I haven't gotten them them.
