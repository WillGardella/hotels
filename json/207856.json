We found this boutique hotel to be charming, spacious, comfortable, and loved the art deco lobby/dining area. Our stay included the buffet breakfast, with all you can drink coffee/juices, and was quite simple and delicious. The room was spacious, had luxury spa toiletries (including a shoe shine sponge, which was very useful after walking around all day), and free internet service. (Much appreciated!) The receptionist was nice and was able to provide us directions to our destinations. The location was extremely convenient, being located a couple blocks from the subway station. From the Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport, we took the Air France bus directly to Porte Maillot, for approximately 15 euros/pp one way. We then just walked a few blocks to the hotel. My only negative comment, is that they need to update their computer system/get the quirks worked out. When we first checked in, I inquired in regards to the breakfast buffet included with our stay, and at first the receptionist said that she did not see it included. So, I had to show her my receipt, and then it was sorted out. Also on checkout, there was a phone charge from our hotel room, and when we told the receptionist that we did not make any phone calls. He told us that it was automated, so we must have made the call. I refused to pay the extra charge (based on principal) and was never bothered by the charge again.

We also emailed the hotel, both in French and English, to request a light and quiet room. The hotel emailed us back to acknowledge our request. However, things didn't quite go as well as we'd expected. To start with, there was no warm welcome upon check-in from either the doorman, who ignored us completely, or the young man in reception, who was rather rude and took quite a while to find a room for us (despite our booking well ahead of time). The room we were offered was on the 1st floor was exceptionally dark and depressing, with only half-windows with no view at the top. If one bent down then one could have a view of a constant flow of traffic on the busy avenue. After about an hour in this 'cell', we realized that we could not possibly stay there for 8 nights, and asked if we could have another room. The young and unhelpful man told us that the hotel was fully booked. We were deeply dissatisfied by the whole experience and were feeling very stressed at this point. Fortunately, later on that Sunday evening, the young man was replaced by a much more friendly man, who moved us to another room right on the 5th floor with much more light and a view of the avenue. Although the issue with light was resolved, there was now a problem with noise. Avenue de Malakoff, like other avenues in Paris, are flooded with traffic and the noise can be extremely bad. After staying in this 2nd room for 1 night, we decided to complain formally to the hotel manager the following morning. This resulted in us being shown a room on the 6th floor, which overlooked the back of the hotel. The previous client had just left and we had to wait a while for it to be cleaned. A much more friendly doorman/porter came to help us transfer our luggage to this room. At last, our initial request was granted. The 3rd room was both light and quiet, and we stayed there for the remaining 7 nights. Not sure if we'd like to renew our experience at La Villa Maillot next time we are in Paris.

Our room smelt musty and had a large stain on the wall paper. All the furniture was so old and dated (including the bathroom). There was a giant chair sitting on the side of our bed that stopped us from being able to walk to that side to get into bed. Who does that? so silly. No free WiFi still, even 3 star hotels we stayed in provided that. We were so lucky that we could login to a service in that area provided by Orange for free.

It is also only 10 min walk to L'arc de triumph, 5 min to the Palais de Congres and only 25 min to la Tour Eiffel. Beware that just across the bus stop is another hotel with taxis on the door that will charge you 10 Euros for the ride!! Yes, they might take you for an unwanted tour. Better just walk, it is good for your health and your pocket in a very nice and safe neighbourhood. The reception at the hotel by a cute parisienne was professional and warming. They kept our luggage since we arrived around 9:30 AM until the room was ready around 11:30. The double room was small with small and high windows, but clean and well appointed. The bathroom was small, but well prepared with toilet, separated from the shower area. The beds were again small but comfortable. The hotel has a great sauna and spa at no extra charge to decontract after long days walking the city and visiting places. It is open from 5 to 9 PM. We did not try the restaurant or breakfast on premises, we rather got out to eat in the thousands of great small restaurants and patisseries. Three mayor drawbacks in this place; internet is extra at 18 euros per hour! although, I like to go to Paris to visit Paris and not to be in the web, everybody needs to check his/her mails and look for info and at that cost I found it outrageous. Second, one evening we returned to the hotel and the room had been cleaned but possibly by somebody who was a heavy smoker. It stank to cigaret. We had open the window in very cold Paris and request some sort of spray to combat the odour. Third, at 180 euros per night without breakfast (around U$ 265) it is way overpriced.

The bed was very comfy (lots of down bedding - though the hubby prefers firmer).

One last comment, the location really is PRIME. - It is just a block and a half from a metro stop that is on a great line - many attractions. - Also when coming in from the airport, there is a bus (14 Euro/person) that will drop you off just 2 blocks away from the hotel, rather than taking a $80 cab ride!!!", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, D.C., USA", "Title": "\u201cGood value and service\u201d", "Author": "back-to-bach", "ReviewID": "UR84261486", "Content": "This was our first stay in this area and, while it would not be my first neighborhood choice in Paris, it is extremely convenient to the metro and the CDG bus to the airport.

Good (but pricey) restaurants in the immediate vicinity but we preferred to walk a while and seek out more \"local\" places where the menus where still varied but more reasonably priced. Also a good way to enjoy the Paris environs. The Hotel has a spa (we did not use) and is clean, friendly and comfortable but do not expect lots of extra facilities as you would in a more upmarket Hotel. Our room on floor 6 was a good size (bigger than a recent London Hotel), kept very clean and pleasant by housekeeping, great shower and tea/coffee making equipment and a mini fridge. Bed was very comfortable. The beverage making was a real plus and the Hotel staff were very happy to provide us with fresh milk. Very handy too is the small but well stocked Supermarket across the road. The double glazing was extremely efficient although the room was hot and the air conditioning (see previous reviews) would not set below 27 degrees. Although not a noisey location an open window at night would have let in too much traffic noise. Small niggles included room safe not working despite efforts of two different staff and still did not work the day we left!

Lovely breakfast area in a garden conservatory and breakfast was plentiful but if you wanted a good big cooked breakfast you might be disappointed.

We walked to many of the popular tourist attractions from the hotel as I feel they are within easy walking distance (although others may differ) and allow you to soak up the wonderful atmosphere and beautiful surroundings. Transport links are excellent - Porte Maillot is 600m walk from the hotel where you can connect easily to the Metro or Bus to the airports. Definitely worth a second look.", "Date": "October 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, Paris", "Title": "\u201cPretty good - watch out for the extras though\u201d", "Author": "Kevlondon", "ReviewID": "UR48020043", "Content": "Stayed here for one night due to the 50%+ discount I found on a travel site. Booked a deluxe room for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac180 per night, which sounded reasonable if not exactly cheap. Room was street-facing on the 7th floor, high enough to avoid the worst of the street noise. Room was a typical size for Paris (i.e. small) but big enough for a double bed, easy chair and work desk. Furnishings were adequate if not spectacular. Room was immaculately clean, bed was comfy and the bathrobe and slippers are a nice touch. The problems with this hotel are in the small details. I phoned to request an iron shortly after checking in, and was told I had to travel down to the basement and use the ironing board set up in the massage room. More of an annoyance than a problem I suppose. The WiFi service is eye-wateringly expensive (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac24 for 24 hours) and not especially good - the connection is slow and drops out periodically - I must have logged in 6 or 7 times throughout the evening, and trying to watch video news clips took forever. TV service is equally poor - a limited range of international channels and practically no pay TV to speak of (2 films plus porn), also the TV was maddeningly quiet - even at full blast I couldn't hear some channels while the room window was open. If some hotels can offer 50+ channels, why can't they all?? The breakfast buffet was good, if a little limited in comparison to other hotels I've stayed at. And at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25, it certainly doesn't represent good value. I understand this is very lucrative for hotels, but this price seems excessive - even if I were staying at the George V or the Ritz, I wouldn't expect to pay more than this. Overall not a bad choice for a short trip - I can live without TV as I had work to do, but if I were staying on a leisure break I wouldn't feel I was getting real value for money with the poor quality of the in-room services and dining.", "Date": "October 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel.

We have not stayed in this part of Paris before but we would stay here again on our next trip. We moved over from the Westin Paris (5 stars) which was much more expensive and very impersonal. La Villa Maillot staff was very nice, pleasant and helpful, the room was large by Paris standards (larger than our room at the Westin). Across the street is a very nice grocery store and pharmacy, and there are many great restaurants nearby. Also, Paris Metro, RER and SCNF train stations are about 1 block away. The location is not so much in the heart of the tourist scene, which we prefer, but you do have to walk further (or take the train) to get to some of the sites. Our room was at the back of the hotel and was quiet, except from occassional comings and goings of other guests. 2 minor complaints: The mattress could have been more comfortable (a little saggy), and despite the fact that this is supposed to be a non-smoking hotel, it was clear that someone was smoking in the hotel. The cigarette smoke permeated our room through the air conditioning. I recognize that the hotel has no control over guests who choose to flout the rules and smoke in a non-smoking room, but at least spare the rest of us by making adjustments to the ventilation system.", "Date": "October 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palo Alto, California", "Title": "\u201cWith a bit of care, this place could shine\u201d", "Author": "skwirl", "ReviewID": "UR44702734", "Content": "Based on TripAdvisor reviews, booked six nights here due to its proximity to Porte Maillot (m\u00c3\u00a9tro, known restaurants). Service is above average; rooms are showing their age at this point. The manager/owner genuinely seems interested in the satisfaction of his guests, so I am cutting him a fair bit of slack with this review. What is quite painful is the internet access: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac39 for three days of spotty connections regardless of where you are in the hotel. It regularly resets itself (i.e. drops the session) with no warning -- quite disruptive. After three days of this (at a steep price), I stated that the service was below my expectations and they could either refund me the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac39 or give me another three days for free (which they did). Other than one day when only a single bath towel was left following a service, most everything else is acceptable (buy why were the elevators not vacuumed at all?)
