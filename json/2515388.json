Upon arrival the lobby was very clean and even smelled nice. The front desk clerk was extremely busy and since I also work for a Quality Inn and Suites, I know how crazy things can get so just because the guest service agent couldn't jump up for me I wouldn't find it to be a cause for complaint. The hotel is older though it seems some rennovations have been made or are currently in the works. My room was small but clean, no hairs in the bathroom which is a huge plus for most travelers. The beds were comfortable, wifi was fast, overall the room was well maintained. The General Manager pulled me into conversation and was very nice and professional. He seemed genuine when asking me about how my stay was and that was before he knew I worked for another Choice Hotel, so that is another plus. After hearing some not so nice things about this property from travelers, I can say honestly that my experience was good and I suggest that people find out for themselves as I did.

Our rooms were so cold we ended up grabbing all of the bedding off of the 2nd bed to use on the one we were sleeping in. I turned on the heater and had to shut it off because the smell was so bad. My associate and I had adjoining rooms and both of us ended up doing the same thing and sleeping with our heads under the covers to try and stay warm.

We were not disappointed with either of those aspects. It is only 5-10 minutes from the airport - depending on traffic and the package was a decent price. The car was safe and parking is just on the south side of the lobby so is quite visible. The airport shuttle was free - but make sure you sign up when you check in, as they use a van and it does have limited space. Pick up from the airport was easy - they come when you call from the courtesy phone. We found the front desk staff very helpful and friendly - even at 4:00 am! The staff at the breakfast were also very friendly. The main drawback to this hotel is its age. It is clearly an older building and in some places it really shows. The hallway carpets were not pretty. The a/c - athough it worked, it was quite loud. There are NO elevators at all. So if you have trouble with stairs make sure you ask for a room in the 200s - that is actually their main floor. When we arrived for our first night, we were on the second floor and could really hear the people walking in the room above us. On our return, we were on the 3rd floor, so that was not a problem. The room was large, although very dated (read harvest gold decorations). It was clean and it was nice to have the fridge and micro. I also liked that the sink was outside of the bathroom. There were enough towels for all 4 of us - but the bath towels are quite small and thin. The shower was not good - even with it on, half of the water was still coming out of the faucet so the stream was not strong. Toiletries were provided. The breakfast was good.

Even if I had paid for all five nights, I would have been pleased with my stay. Visiting Seattle, one might not think of staying near the airport, but a helpful staff person at Seattle Southside Visitor Center, which I phoned while planning my trip, offered the tip that the motels and hotels south of the city are a lot less expensive than downtown, and most offer free shuttle to the airport where you can take the light rail (30 minutes) downtown. I didn't need to rent a car and saved a bundle. Public transportation in Seattle is cheap, safe, convenient and pleasant--there are FREE buses downtown, where I spent much of my time. I was also able to take an express bus to Tacoma for a day trip, by walking four blocks from the motel to the bus stop. I got a free ride to the light rail station whenever I wanted it, and even walked (less than a mile) to the station one sunny day when I wanted some exercise. My room was clean and very quiet--when booking, I asked for a quiet room on the top floor. The neighborhood is perfectly safe, and as a woman who travels alone often, that is a priority for me. The only airport noise I noticed was around the time I normally wake up; otherwise the planes don't seem to go over this location much. Comfortable bed and everything clean.

There is a hot breakfast buffet, free Sunday newspaper, internet computers in the lobby, coffee available all day. Overall, this was one of my most pleasant motel stays.

A friend picked us up at the airport and took us sight seeing but the free shuttle would have been nice had we needed it. I wish I would have really known how far the hotel was from downtown Seattle because after our sight seeing it was quite the drive (especially since we were on the far side of Seattle in Kirkland). Once we arrived at the hotel the staff was helpful and nice. They told us about the options for getting to Pier 91 for our cruise the following morning and that there would be breakfast. I was under the impression that the hotel had 3 floor starting at ground level but it really had 1 floor that was below ground level, unless you walked outside down a hill to the back door. So, we had rooms on the 1st floor but had to go down a flight of stairs. This was hard to do especially with our heavy luggage. Mainly I felt bad for my mom. After a long day of walking around in Seattle this was the last thing she needed. We helped her out though and all was well....until we went to get into our rooms. My husband and I entered ours fine but my mom couldn't get her key to work. We tried it about 10 times and then went to the front desk. The front desk worker came down to help and she couldn't get the key to work either. She even tried her master room key and it was no opening. So, my mom was giving another room...just one room down but she was tired and crabby with this incident. After we got settled in, we grabbed some pop from the vending machines and watched a movie. Then it was time for bed. The beds were fine, smaller queens but okay. We all slept pretty well since we were tired from traveling. The shower was great in the morning. The halls were noisy with others leaving and the cleaning staff was talking loudly to each other about some issues. The breakfast was packed and only okay. There were two computers in the lobby which were nice to access before our 7 day cruise. I was please with the available and speed of the internet! We chose to take a taxi to Pier 91 because the shuttle was booked except for a 10 leave time which I thought was too early to get to the pier but it probably would have been okay. The taxi was only about $8 so not a huge deal to us.

Got to the hotel at midnight. We were awoken by the night desk clerk at 3:00 a.m., asking if the people who stayed in our room the night before, could come up and get some things they left in a dresser drawer. No, was the answer, but will put the drawer outside the room. At 3:15 a.m. phone rang again. Desk clerk said the people wanted to come up and search the room because some items were missing. Absolutely not, come back in the a.m. It was a poor decision of the night desk to wake us up and ask such a question. Also, housekeeping should have been more thorough in cleaning the room from the night before. We should not have paid for the room.

This one did not live up to those standards. The room was clean, the lobby attractive, the staff friendly, but the physical condition of much of the building leaves a lot to be desired. The hallways stink and the carpet is filthy! It was so bad that the smell carried into the room; I walked down to 7-11 to get some room deodorizer to cut through it. With a generous amount of that, then leaving the window open, it finally got better by the next morning. No elevators. Lots of physical upgrades needed.

The carpet is old but one of the staff commented that management was going to redo all the carpeting. You could tell there was gum and other gunk in places on the carpet but it was more old than dirty. The main floor hallway had a strong smell of smoke but our 2nd floor hallway was OK. Bathroom was simple. The sink and mirror are part of the room. Our room had a microwave and a fridge. Local calls were free. We couldn't hear our neighbors even though it was apparently 100% full that night. That said the building is old and wood-frame so I wouldn't be surprised with some of the other reviews. One of our friends couldn't sleep because of the occasional airplane flying overhead. Breakfast was very simple, with cereal, the standard waffle-iron waffles, coffee and juice. I'd stay again but then I again there are many other hotels in the area so I might try a neighboring one. Overall, no real complaints. It's no Holiday Inn but then it doesn't pretend to be.

Lighting is dim throughout the hotel. Fridge and microwave in the room. We actually saw many plane crew members stay here too - to my surprise.
