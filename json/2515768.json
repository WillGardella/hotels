The maid STOLE my phone charger, the walls are paper thin, its located on a busy street with loud traffic (see paper thin walls), the keys to the door are old-school/not plastic cards whic is a security concern, the general look and feel is very outdated and poorly-repaired. Also, they were doing construction on another part of the hotel every morning at 7am which was not appreciated. Additionally, the maid took all the towels from the bathroom and replaced them (none were on the floor) so they obviously aren't worried about conservation. I will not recommend this hotel to my friends.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada, United States", "Title": "\u201cBad bed and slamming door\u201d", "Author": "Juliet640", "ReviewID": "UR120099413", "Content": "So I checked in the hotel very early like 11am with no additional charge which was greatly appreciated since I was driving all night long. So I got into the room and the room was ok I guess for being a dive. However the bed was so hard and not comfortable I kept waking up though out the night. The noise there was loud would be even worse in the Summer due to the high amount of early 20 year old kids. The room next door to me was smoking illegal stuff and very loud. The doors do not come with a card swipe its old fashion its an actual key which if you lose it they will charge you 20 bucks so hold onto it at the beach. So the doors you have to slam close since the knobs do not turn on the outside so you will wake up from hearing the door being slammed closed. Now it was so close to the beach and shops so you can walk everywhere which is a plus. But was there anyone to clean my room my room only got serviced once the rest of the days it did not. Now some of the days I slept in till 11am 12 noon and the maid service was still there but I guess you have to leave before she goes to the next floor once shes on the next floor forget her coming back up. I told the hotel staff and they didnt care. My tv remote control did not work and the shower stall had no head so the water sprays everywhere. Would never stay there again!! Learned my lesson pay more. PLUS THE PARKING THERE IS BAD ONLY 6 SPOTS SO GOOD LUCK IN THE SUMMER TIME!!", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tempe, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGreat for a budget\u201d", "Author": "nitro712", "ReviewID": "UR118433348", "Content": "This is a rather nice hotel if you are on a budget.

If you have a lot of $$$, then no need to stay here, but if you are out on a very limited budget, this is a great place to stay. Don't expect 5 star quality for a 2 star price.

The first room they gave us had little daylight so the nice man at the desk gave us a courtyard room with a big window. It was very basic. The carpet was wet and so the room was very damp. The lampshades were old and broken! The dresser had no drawers. It was quite a shock. The good points were the bed was clean and there were no bugs at all. It was clean. There is parking if your lucky enough to get one. Just don't move your car. The airconditioner wall unit worked. There is ice at the front desk and pastries and coffee for breakfast. You are allowed to use the pool at the other property next door tho we did not and cannot review it. The staff were nice.

This is among the worst lodging experiences I've ever had. This past weekend I was traveling to San Diego for a friend's wedding. The wedding party had rooms set aside at a resort near here, but they had a two night minimum, and the nightly rate was almost double. So we decided to find a place close by, like the Seacoast Palms. Sure, the pictures online didn't look that nice, and there were a number of poor reviews. But we figured, all we really need is a bed, right? How wrong we were. The shadiness started even before we got there. We called ahead to see if they had cribs for babies. They do, but told us they couldn't guarantee we'd get one because \"someone else that night might want one.\" Seems to me this is the kind of thing calling ahead to reserve might take care of. The good news is, we did get the crib. The bad news is, that's the last piece of good news. When we got to our room, we were hit by the same weird smell every other review mentions. Oh well. That's not completely out of the ordinary. But it didn't stop there. Only one of the three lights in the room worked. The air was stifling, and the AC would only stay on for a few minutes at a time. The iron which was listed as one of the room amenities was non-existent. Yet still, all of these \"problems\" we could deal with. Sure, we paid over a hundred dollars to stay here, but hey, it's the height of beach season. But things got much, much worse. We returned from our wedding around 11PM to find there was no parking, even though the website touts their \"ample parking.\" Call me crazy, but I feel like that's one of those things a hotel should gaurantee their guests. Instead, we had to drive around in the middle of the night looking for a place to park, which if you've ever tried to park in a beach town, you know is no easy task. We ended up finding a place many blocks away, and walking back to our hotel. Unacceptable, but still not the worst part of the night. When we finally reached the hotel, there were 15-20 people partying loudly in the parking lot, on the stairs, outside of the rooms, etc. I'm talking mardis gras level partying. Still, we went up to our room thinking we could block it out and get some sleep. Cut to 2 in the morning, we're still awake, people are literally screaming outside of our door, and all the while, management seemed unwilling or unable to stop them. Two and a half hours later, 4:30AM the party is still going strong, drunken idiots are randomly knocking on our door, and still, management does nothing. Again, I could've overlooked every other shortcoming of this hotel if at the very least, we were able to get a semi-good nights rest. Well, maybe not the parking. In short, this place is horrible. It is only a block or two away from the beach. But I mention this only in the hopes you will save your money and go with the much cheaper, much quieter option of sleeping on the beach. PS. I would've written this review while I was up all night in this horrible hotel, but they didn't have internet access of any kind.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tempe, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cNot much going for it other than the location\u201d", "Author": "elsal", "ReviewID": "UR114833931", "Content": "A last minute trip to escape the desert heat got us to stay at the Seacoast Palms.

We stayed two nights. There were pros and cons. I saw an earlier review where the manager replied and said they were making improvements. From what I saw I believe him. The room was old and outdated but it was clean. They did provide a fridge and lots of towels and compliementary toiletry items. The bed was comfortable. The location is excellent. Just a few blocks down from Garnett which is a sweet spot for alot of the action in the area. There was plenty of parking and the hotel workers were friendly. We checked in late and found out the tv made a humming noise. After bringing it to the front desks attention the following morning, they promptly replaced it with another one that worked fine. While I had the maintenance man there, I had him tighten up the power socket next to the bed where the sconse lighting plugged in, that fixed that problem. Because the doors open to the outside, and this is a beach town with younger crowds, we did hear alot of late night noise.
