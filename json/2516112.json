If i went to this motel expecting a motel, i would just say I got what i paid for. Here is why its NOT a 3 star hotel and rather a 1.5 star or MAYBE 2 star motel. First, Dixie Hollywood Hotel was the DAYS INN....that should already ring alarm bells.......had I paid Motel price for this place, I probably wouldnt have posted a review, but this is to WARN hotwire customers that if you are getting sold a 3 star hotel in hollywood, you MIGHT get this place, which will truly disappoint you. Lets start with the location. This place is located on the east side of Hollywood, which will tell you its not the best part Hollywood has to offer. When you pull up in this motel, thats exactly what the surroundings are. It is NOT a hotel, if you go to \"answers.com\" here is what a motel is defined: Answer A motel, was derived as a combination of the words \"motor hotel,\" is best described as a one or two story structure with rooms that open to the exterior of the building, usually surrounded by a common balcony or patio. A hotel has rooms that open to the interior of the building, along a hallway, and is multi-storied. Definitely not a HOTEL. Anyway, I check in and received the room next to their outdoor laundromat which with my luck, was laundry day since there were a couple of people using the facility. Since the walls and doors were paper thin, I can hear their conversations. Fortunately, I was leaving to my event, so I didnt have to hear why they took \"Happy Days\" off the air. But before I left, I went to my bathroom, to notice the moldy dirty sink that my 3 star MOTEL had for me. I had to brush my teeth in the shower because I didnt want any bacteria to grow on my tooth brush or tooth paste. When I arrived back at the MOTEL, all the parking spaces were full except for the registration spot. I parked there and notified the night clerk that I would be parking there. He decides its a perfect time to argue since its 3am. He told me that I cannot park there because it would be inconvenient for people who want to check in, but go ahead and park at the handicap spot. That made a lot of sense...lol, he doesnt want to inconvenience people who may want to check in, but go ahead and take up the handicap space of someone who may actually need the convenience to park there. I told him I did not feel comfortable taking up a handicap spot both morally and for the safety of my car (what if this clown leaves and forgets to tell the person taking over his shift that he allowed me to park there??). After 15 minutes of trying to convince me to park there and that it wont get towed or whatever, he decides to prove to me that its ok to park there by removing his car from one of the spaces that I could have parked in and to park there. I asked why didnt you do this in the first place?? he just ignored me and went back to his indoor MOTEL lobby. However, if it means anything, IF i KNEW what i was purchasing, I would have given it a 1.5 or 2 stars to be fair, but hotwire said i was getting a 3 star hotel and to me, thats false advertising.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seminole, Florida", "Title": "\u201cFair value\u201d", "Author": "Callard1", "ReviewID": "UR126806244", "Content": "We booked this hotel through a 3rd party vendor so our price was fair.

We were on the first floor and heard plenty of thumps from the people above us. Also, the rooms aren't huge, so if you're traveling with a group or packing along several kids, it might get a little crowded in a hurry. But for a couple or a small family, there's plenty of room. Note that the hotel is in the heart of Thai Town. If you like Thai food, you're in heaven. If you don't (like us), then don't plan on walking to a restaurant. But there's no shortage of food choices within a few minutes of driving or a Metro stop in any direction.

However when we arrived after having paid for the shuttle there we were told that they had no record of our booking and that we were booked in at the other Days Inn which is some way out of Hollywood and not even on the Walk of Fame which its name is attached to.

We phoned reception but could get no reply so went and saw them the following morning to complain but they were disinterested so we left it at that but it did not leave a favourable impression of this hotel and its staff. However in their favour when we tried to use the laundry within hours and could not get it to work their maintenance man assisted us to get it operative and was very helpful. The road that the hotel is on is also very noisy with traffice and sirens going often so if you are looking for a quiet sleep forget this hotel. The rooms are old and dark inside but shower is fine and yopu have tea and coffee making faciitlities available although with Starbucks across the road and coffee and tea cheap you do not need this. We stayed three nights and enjoyed our time in L.A. but not this hotel. Also there is a complimentry buffett breakfast in the smallest breakfast room we have ever been in and what is offered is meagre comprsiing stale bread, horrible waffles and juice and we chose to go into Hollywoodd to get our breakfast.. On the basis of our stay we could not recommend this place particlularly as we felt like we had been tipped out to their other hotel perhaps becuase they were full and had overbooked people.

I've stayed here the past few years from time to time. Price was ok, rooms clean but basic. Never saw any bugs. However, my last trip put me off this place for good! I was placed next to room that was undergoing construction and also had very noisy neighbors (adults talking loud every morning). Late Sat night (11PM) they came back to the room drunk and with a group of friends. Extremely noisy. Called down twice to front desk, they didn't bother the first time, then they came and told everyone to be quiet. Didn't help. Another guest on the other side of that room also called the front desk. Noise continued, they were extremely drunk. I serioously thought of calling the cops. Finally around 3AM they started to get unusually quiet. That's when I started to smell something strange coming from the common door between the rooms, marijuana! As much as I wanted to call the front desk or even the cops, I didn't want any trouble for myself so I put pillows at the bottom of that door, covered my face and tried to sleep. Finally went to sleep around 4:30AM, I was supposed to be up at 6AM! Around 8AM, a friend of the noisy neighbors came to their room and started banging on their door and calling them, when they didn't answer, he went to housekeeping who then decided it may be the wrong room and opened mine instead! No knock on my door, just someone opening it with a key without my consent! Luckily I had the deadbolt on it. When I checked out, the lady at the front counter apologized for the night (she wasn't the night person on duty) and gave me a discount on the room. It really should've been free but I was to tired to fight the issue. I left promising myself I would never return! Location is great if you want to be in Hollywood, close to Graumann's, etc. However, the area is really bad now. There's always people hanging around very late at night. They had a security guard out in the parking lot on Friday night; they should also have one on Saturdays.

The carpet was nasty and we spent our time in the hotel with either flip flops or socks... sock which basically were garbage upon departure.

There was some upgrade work going on during our stay and we could see that most rooms were getting new carpet and paint. The outside of the hotel was being painted with Hollywood murals which looked very cool and defiantly added to the image of the hotel. The location was very good for the Metro which was located around 150 meters from Hollywood/Western station which is on the red line. Chinese theatre was around a 10 minute drive in typical traffic and around 20 minutes to the Beverly Hills area. I would say the local facilities are okay, it is just across the road from a Starbucks and there is a small shopping centre across from the hotel with a handful of uninteresting stores. There are a number of places to eat in the local area but they were not to my taste, mainly small restaurants and for some reason almost all Thai.

I needed a place for three nights to sleep and do some work in the evenings for three nights. My criteria were simple: clean, comfortable. economical, and in a convenient location (as my meetings were all around the L.A. area). This Day's Inn hit the mark on all fronts (though the maid service could have been better). Reading all the recent reviews I had serious second thoughts about this hotel, so only booked for one night and had a back-up booked for the next two nights. With regard to the bad review comments: I did find one cockroach in the bathroom when I arrived, but the little critter was quite dead (so the exterminator had done his work), and saw none dead or alive since. (It's an old building in the middle of the city, so an occasional roach should not be a shock to any experienced traveler, especially if it's already dead). The first room I was given was a bit shabby (the rugs were older and stained here and there and the bed covers a bit threadbare in spots) and the rugs could have been cleaner (like the maid never bothered to vacuum close to the walls or corners), but the bathroom was spotless and overall cleanliness satisfactory. As I could not connect to the Internet from that room, I asked to be moved to a room closer to the office, and much to my surprise this room was two stars higher in quality: new bathroom with granite sink and contemporary shower curtain, upscale (almost former Marriott quality) bedding with sophisticated matching window treatments (not just curtains). Rest of room was pretty standard. My only criticism would be that management must have low standards as even though much of the room was newly remodeled, no one ever bothered to do the finishing touch cleanup (i.e., cleaning up the excess caulking around the granite or the paint smudges off the shower fixtures, and again, getting the maids to vacuum thoroughly). The location for foreign tourists (who tend not to rent cars) is convenient to bus service and less than a half block to the metro entrance. For motorists the entrance to the Hlywd Freeway (101) is also a half block away and though no business or tourist sites are walking distance, you can't beat the location (less than 20 minutes to Burbank and the TV and movie studios there, Universal Studios, downtown L.A., Hollywood tourist sites, etc. More convenient yet is that you are in the middle of \"Thai Town\", a restaurant destination for locals, with dozens of authentic Thai eating establishments in every price range and that serve late even on week nights. Also nearby is a Quiznos, Cold Stone Creamery, large Ralph's supermarket and more, so you never need to travel if you're hungry. In conclusion, NO, this is not up to the standards of a newer suburban or Interstate highway exit Day's Inn, and it's nowhere close to a Marriott Courtyard or even a Hampton Inn, but it is also half the price, and at $65-$80 on average for a room, quite a value compared to most anything else around", "Date": "December 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, CO", "Title": "\u201cIf you can't do a decent continental breakfast...don't do one at all\u201d", "Author": "RizzoDenver_CO", "ReviewID": "UR11145647", "Content": "I can not understand hotels that promise a continental breakfast and produce a pathetic display.

I booked this motel based on the good reviews I saw on this site however now I found them to be misleading. I just want to provide a different point of view here. I am not a critical person. In fact this would be the first negative review I have written. I travelled often and I can easily say this is one of the worse places I have stayed at. I have very basic standards, as I only sleep in a motel a few hours at night anyway. Unfortunately Days Inn Hollywood failed to meet my most basic standards at every count. Top 10 problems 1.Interior - This motel was supposed to be newly renovated but everything from carpet to furniture to wall was old (see pic). I had a very hard time imagining what it was like before the \u201crenovation\u201d. However this wasn\u2019t a big problem as I was not there to admire its interior design. 2.Internet - Wireless internet was important to me but it did not work on the first night but it did work at other times. 3.TV - The remote control for the TV did not work. 4.Service - One of the lamps in the room did not work either. But that was only the beginning\u2026 When I found out that it didn\u2019t work I went down to reception and asked (very politely) whether they had a spare light bulb. I didn\u2019t really expect them to have any but I thought it was worth a try as the room was very dark. However the response I got from the front desk staff shocked me. He rolled his eyes, raised his voice and said: \u201cis it really THAT important to have a light bulb changed at this hour at night??\u201d (It was 930pm.) I was very shocked at his response as I asked very politely! I am no expert but I thought a simple \u201csorry I don\u2019t have any spare bulbs but I will let housekeeping know tomorrow\u201d may have been a much better response. That was the worst service I have received at a motel. 5.Bedding - There were holes in every layer of bedding from the sheets, blanket, to bed cover (see pic). Well at least they were consistent! The pillows were so old and worn out I would have thrown them out years ago. 6.Interior - There was a hole in the wall and they put a tissue box in it (see pic). I have to give them points for innovation. 7.Noise - Some of the rooms can be very noisy as it is on Hollywood Blvd., a 6-lane street. 8.Location - The location is not very central. It\u2019s at the edge of Hollywood and most locals actually consider that part of town as \u201cThai town\u201d rather than Hollywood. 9.Diner - The diner closes at 6pm and honestly if it stays open longer I still would not eat there. It didn\u2019t look right. Sometimes when I walked by and saw only 1 staff person as the chef/waiter/cleaner. 10.Smell \u2013 This was the problem that affected me the most. On the first day I was given a supposedly non-smoking room however the room totally stink. I was hoping it was cigarette smell but it could be something worse! I didn\u2019t know what the smell was. I went to reception but they insisted it was a non-smoking room. I put up with the smell on the first night but I was coughing and was frustrated. I had my windows opened (with a busy 6-lane street only meters away) but the smell persisted. I was kept up by the traffic noise and/or smell, and only slept for 2 hours. I went back to the reception next day and made up some lame excuse to get a different room (as they insisted the room is fine the day before). The second room didn\u2019t smell and I felt much better then. The only merits I found of this motel is that it is located within 50 meters of a metro station, bus station and supermarket. And housekeeping did a good job cleaning the room. As you can see I had a terrible experience and I would not recommend it to anyone other perhaps students. When I was there there was a group of 30-40 high school students stayed there and they seemed to have a good time on their school trip.

I've booked the room thru daysinn.com 2 week in advance and was given quite a good rate. This motel is situated along Hollywood Blvd, a junction after Western Ave. There's a subway (Metro) beside it (4 minutes walk), Ralphs Supermart opposite (3 minutes walk) and a few eateries along side. If you're a Thai food fan, just cross the street, walk to your right for about 5 minutes, there's a Thai Food Restaurant (a simple-decorated cafe) which serves economical authentic stuff. Most of their customers are Thai. I've tried their beef noodle clear soup, seafood fried rice and Pad Thai and all are yummy! Noodles are charge at $3 (small) and $5 (large), fried rice is $6 and Pad thai is $5.50. The internet access from room is free. Just bring along notebook and get the password from the counter staff (wireless access). Internet speed is ok, but if your room is far away from main office, line gets drop off easily. Breakfast is very simple, coffee/tea, white bread and cereal.. No donuts (i've got donut when i stayed there a few years ago). The only thing i hated is the walking noise from the upper deck rooms (2 level). There'll be creaking noise when other guest walk around the room or dragging their luggages. If you're light sleeper, maybe should get the upper deck one. Overall, the motel is ok to us as most of the time we're out and only back to the room at night. There's a little nice pool but it's too cold to use it right now.. maybe during summer-time when we have chance to visit again.", "Date": "February 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "the 'Peg", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Customer Service\u201d", "Author": "SleepyTime", "ReviewID": "UR6178627", "Content": "After being rudely treated late in the night by another hotel down the road, we had to find another hotel on the spot.

You have to laugh at disparaging remarks about it being not near Universal Studios, it is just a couple of subway stops away, yet a motel nearer the studios would cost 2 or 3 times as much. It is on a main road, easy to find by car, near some good restaurants and just a stones throw from the Walk of Fame, if you take the subway, it is just 30 feet or so from the front door, and a few stops and you are at Kodak Theatre and the hubbub of Hollywood. Great hotel if you are looking for cheap, clean and comfortable, great friendly staff and breakfast thrown in. Ralph's is across the street if you fancy a little more than cereal for your breakfast.

Met only two staff persons, first at check-in (he let me check in much earlier than the \"official\" time, for which I was grateful) then at check-out, also a nice guy who said \"we've never heard of such complaints as yours before.\" I doubt that: because of the location in the sleazier side of Hollywood, and because of the lower price and the national chain affiliation, the place was completely full both nights--and the other customers were taking full advantage. Banging doors, thumps, and so on, all night long. Sirens. Ambulances. Just noise everywhere. The room had a frig, which was good, but not much TV service--abbreviated cable, but terrible TV reception. The airconditioner worked but only as \"full on\" or off, so it had to be turned off as it was really freezing. Opening the window in that ground floor room would have been madness. It is not so much anything the staff did wrong that made the experience less than great. They got me in early, and the booking terms were exactly as described online.

We had booked three nights hoping to base here for visiting Universal Studios and Hollywood. On our visit to the USA we had stayed in a good number of other hotels so on arrival we were not surprised by the location right by the very busy and noisy Hollywood Boulevard. But on entering our room we were simply astonished and appalled. Apart from a bed, TV, chair and bathroom there were no other 'facilities'. There was nowhere to hang clothes and little room to have suitcases open. Plug sockets looked unsafe as some were hanging out of the wall. Then my wife inspected the bed. There were 'soiled' tissues under the bottom sheet. The bed and room smelt of smoke (non-smoking room). The room was dirty.The bathroom had not been properly cleaned and the toilet.......(don't ask !) When leaving the room to speak to reception I was stopped by a woman who was begging - on the hotel property ! We just couldn't stay a moment longer. The receptionist seemed unfazed by our complaint and refunded the 2nd and 3rd nights payment but was unable to refund for the first night. Although not happy with this - we had only been in the room for 10 minutes - we had to accept as we just wanted to get away. This hotel is just awful.
