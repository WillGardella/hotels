We arrived by feet since we took the BART. The location is close to Yerba Buena and Union Square. Yerba Buena has a kids museum with bowling alley/skating ring which we were unable to par take because one of the days we were there they had a private event. We did explore the city without a problem on public transporation which included trolley, cable cars, BART and the muni. The hotel was situation in a great area for our travels. We were close enough to Union Square, but not in the madness altough Market Street is a busy street. We had a room on 31st floor which had a view of Unions Square and the waterfront! It was amazing! One of our nights there we saw lighting and my dh (dear husband) was trying to capture pictures from our room with his new nifty camera. We did not use any of the hotel amenities if it had any because we were out in about exploring the City. For the most part, it was a nice stay in a clean hotel. The beds were kind of hard, but the pillows made up as well as the in room robes which is a nice comfortable touch. You can't use the fridge for personal items otherwise alledgly they will charge you if an item is removed and/or moved for longer than 10 seconds! So, had to leave leftovers at the restaurants (sad and a waste). My husband checked us in, so i don't know how his experience was with front desk.

Had an bad experience with the concierge. Coming from Europe, it was our first time in SF. On our first day in the city, we went to the concierge for help. One of the thing we had to do was to walk across the Golden Gate bridge and enjoy the view of the bay from there. We did not know how to get there from the hotel. The concierge did not seem very competent in showing us the way and could not tell us very clearly how to get there by bus. She was a bit clumsy with the map. Then, one of her colleague passed behind her and told her that the bridge was closed for pedestrians. She did not check to confirm the information and simply sold us the bike tour company that they work with for $72 (for 2 people). It was \"the only way\" we could see the view from the bridge (we did not have a car at this time). We then thought we had no choice but to buy the 24hr bike rental as we could not come to SF and not go over the bridge. It was only to our sad surprise that once we reached the bridge there was lots of pedestrians crossing the bridge. We were really unhappy about this and disppointed that the hotel misinformed us. We ended spending money for something we did not was based on their advice. We got back to the hotel late that night and decided to share our feedback/complaints with the concierge the next morning. Another person received us and told us that they thought the bridge was closed. I know that this is mainly a hotel for business but if the concierge is not well informed to advise tourists then you may as well not have a concierge desk. Furthermore, the person took my name, room number and assured me that the desk manager would contact me to explain the situation. I told him that I was checking out the next day and he said that it would be fine, someone would get back to me before then. I checked my messages three times and asked upon check out if the concierge left me a message. NOTHING. I am not sure what I expected: a refund of perhaps just an apology but I got none of the above. Very disappoiting to say the least for such a flagship hotel. And the cherry on the cake was that on the back of the SF city maps that they give to everyone, there is a 5 USD discount per person applicable on the bike tour they sold to us. They obviously 'forgot' to mention that to us when they booked it for us... Beware of the concierge in this hotel! The hotel itself has nothing particular.

The room was spacious, full of light, and had all of the amenities you would expect at hotel of this class. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable, something that I find very important and often supbar, even at luxury hotels. I did not have time to see the gym, so I can't comment on that, but they had rental excercise gear from new balance, which I thought was a good idea. The location is excellent and was right in the middle of everything. I was there for 4 nights for a conference at Moscone, which was literally a 2 minute walk. I did have a day to explore the city, so being in the middle of everything and next to the T (subway) was helpful. As far as food, I didn't eat at the hotel bar/restaurant. However, the caliber of restaurants within walking distance was impressive. The best part was the service. I was first greated by Rocelyn (I think that was her name) who was very curteous and helpfull. Everyone I talked to had a smile on, which was nice. One day it was really pouring (big surprise in SF), and I was surpirsed that as I was leaving in my suit they offered me a loaner umbrella to take with me. Never had that happen at a hotel before! Overall, an impressive hotel in a great location with excellent service. I highly recommend this hotel, especially if you need to be near Moscone or the heart of the city.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island NY", "Title": "\u201cIn the Middle of Everything\u201d", "Author": "beentheredonethat56", "ReviewID": "UR126978180", "Content": "This Westin is right in the middle of everything I need access to in SF: Market St (duh!), convention center, Embarcadero (walking distance) and even a Whole Foods.

However, I was on a very high floor, and with floor-to-ceiling windows, the view was spectacular. My one disappointment is that because of a change in plans, I needed to cancl my last night and at check-in, asked if the reservation could be changed to the Westin at SFO. Although there was no penalty to do so, she said that \"the systems were not linked\" and I would have to make the change myself. As a consolation, she said, airport hotels are usually much cheaper. Unfortunately, after many tries to get through to the Westin SFO, the rate rate was actually about $100 MORE than I was paying ($379 vs $279). I ended up staying at the Hilton SFO which boasted a huge room for $179 instead.

Definitely walk-able to lots of destinations. Walked from Little Italy and North Beach one night and felt safe and definitely easy to find. Academy of the Arts and MOMA San Francisco are right there.

We were first greeted by the very friendly and forward-thinking check-in staff who offered us a small bar fridge in addition to the crib for my baby. (the fridge was so useful to keep snacks and drinks for my ever so hungry toddler) Our room is what we expected for a Westin: beautiful heavenly beds that were so comfy that we had the best sleep ever for the 4 nights we stayed in SF. The crib is not just a portable pack and play, it was an actual mobile crib and even the baby slept for a reasonable amount of time (didn't have to get up in the middle of the night for the first time since before he was born). The rooms were large and spacious (we had a 2 queen bed) and the flat screen TVs were nice to keep my toddler entertained. The view from our room was of Kearny street and since we were on a lower floor, we could hear some street noise but it did not bother us at all. The 2nd time we checked in, we were given a room on the highest floor (36th) which had no street noise but the view was fantastic: same aspect, but we could see Union Square, San Francisco Bay and the top of the Bay bridge on the other side. Getting to and from this hotel from the airport using BART was no problem at all and it was convenient to other means of public transport (buses, the F-line, cable car) because of its proximity to Market Street.

If you are staying at Westin San Francisco Market Street hotel on vacation or pleasure you might want find a smaller or Boutique Hotel. The last two times I have not been impressed by the service!! In fact I would highly recommend staying away from Ducca Restaurant. The service was really bad! They had bad wine and horrible beer available on the happy hour menu. Nobody finished their drinks!! The Westin San Francisco Market Street concierge desk is excellent. They booked all my tickets to the California Academy of Sciences and provided some excellent recommendations for dinner. Highly recommend using their services except. I wanted to use the hotel driving service but they wanted to charge me $65 for an inter-city drop off. That is crazy. Hotel has no shuttle service. If you stay at the W hotel one block away you can reserve the Acura. I have never eaten breakfast at this hotel. Good Peets coffee and Starbucks directly across the street. In my opinion the Westin San Francisco Market Street is the best option when staying in San Francisco on business. Hotel fails short for personal travel. Carmen at the front check-in desk is very helpful. It's night and day between her and some of the other staff. Also beware that if you leave your luggage on a cart with the luggage staff it won't be locked up. This happened twice. I was really concerned with somebody walking off with my laptop.

Staff: was excellent; requested a high floor, which I didn't necessarily get (17 of 30something), but it was high enough. Requested a king away from the elevator, which I did get. Used the concierge a couple times, who were very helpful. Needed a 6 passenger cab for transport to the airport, which was easily arranged with the doorman (though plan ahead). Cleaning staff were all friendly. Room: considering the price, $311/night, I've stayed in nicer rooms at that price. Bathroom was pretty small. Had a large king bed, which was extremely comfortable. Full sized desk as well as another chair next to the bed. Large flat screen TV was nice, but due to the shape of the room, was kind of in an awkward position to watch from bed. Room had plenty of plugs for cell/laptop/iPad chargers. Closet was a little small, as well as the storage for clothes (for those of us who like to unpack). Not a huge fan of the Westin brand toiletries--but that's the same at all their hotels (W stuff is much better). The room I had was a pretty nice location; very end of the hall, almost a corner-type room, with a view of the bay. It was right next to the ice machine, but I NEVER heard it. Food: didn't eat in the hotel a single time, though friends who did use the restaurant said it was very good. Misc: The gym is average. Not very large. At one time, there were 10+ people there, and it was way too crowded. I did see signs about Westin clients being able to use the gym at the Four Seasons, but I didn't investigate this. It should be noted, the elevators were extremely fast. The hotel was crowded, there are tons of rooms, yet I never felt I had to wait for an elevator. Overall, the place was clean, staff was awesome and accommodating, and the Westin bed is very nice to sleep in when spending such a long time in a hotel room.

Check in was prompt and efficient and I was given an upgrade to an available suite, which was great. The room was clean and quiet and had really nice views of San Francisco. There were large flat panel televisions in both the sitting room and the bedroom. Westin has recently changed to a new television interface that is nice, but a little laggy. I've noticed this in several recently Westin's that I stay in. I did not utilize the much of the hotel amenities this time around due to the short nature of my stay. Previously the gym was adequate, but nothing special. Not sure if it has changed or not this time around. The doorman was friendly and efficient, and I did use their car service back to the airport.

No problem if you are waiting for towels, but if you need serious help, (security or health) they will NOT answer if they are taking service requests. You don't ring-through, or even connect to voice mail. Women traveling alone looking for a good hotel need to consider what happened to me. My first night I woke at 11:30 to clicking noises at my door then knocking. I went to the peephole, the person was gone. Second incident same thing, nobody visible. 3rd time I realize a disturbed person was knocking on my adjoinging door that attaches to his room. He periodically knocked, then started whistling through the crack in our door. I called express service,, rang off the hook. (FYI,,, I was told by the staff dialing \u201cO\u201d uses the same phone line.) To be 100% accurate, after the fact, they said my only other choice was to dial 7005 the front desk. Try to imagine yourself as a new guest knowing this # at midnight in the dark I dressed to go to the lobby, gave the phone another try, got right through. A second-string guy arrived in room service attire, said the security guy was handling another matter. (interesting!) I was told CALL IF IT HAPPENED AGAIN. I told him he didn't get it,,, the guy was repeatedly knocking on my adjoining door, not my hall door. The creep knocked again while the room service guy was there, now my credibility can't be questioned. The room service guy knocked on the this guys door for over a minute, no success. I had to personally call this fella on my phone and demand he come out and get this resolved. The low-life opened, denied doing anything till I told him the room service guy was my witness.

All 3 days I was politely told I could talk to him \u201cif you want\u201d. Decide for yourself if this type of attitude brought change. The point Mr -- doesn't get is that by turning his cowardly head, word has gotten out to people similar to my neighbor, that this behavior at this particular Westin is tolerated, they need their business. If guests don't take charge they will look the other way. The staff are fine, but Mr -- trained employees to say he is available \u201cif you want\u201d. He isn't smart enough to realize his lazy inaction and aloofness leads to obvious speculation that this creepy room activity is the norm, and perhaps occurs too often to handle professionally.

Although there are no other passengers around, she insists on using the speaker phone, telling him to please step back, as she calls out non-existant customers to come forward and present their ticket, as Stiller waits, frustrated and mystified.

The United Airlines (flight 6350, January 20) plane smells like vomit, c'mon United Airlines, heard of air freshner or even better, cleaning? By the time we landed, my husband and I both agreed to drive from now on, in our comfortable Range Rover. It wouldn't have taken any longer. And we wouldn't have been subjected to the indignities of over-zealous TSA agents. We arrived at the Westin, to face a long line at the front desk. When we finally got to the counter, we asked if it would be possible to extend our trip by a day. The man behind the desk said, \"Yes, there is availablity but I don't know what your rate will be, can I help you with anything else?\" Clearly, he wanted us to move along. Odd, one would think that if a hotel has availablity and people wanting to stay there, they would be helpful in making these arrangements. On our way to the elevator, the bellman moved around us and pushed onto the elevator with a full trolley of suitcases. No one had offered to help us with ours. I pointedly said to him, \"You go on ahead, we'll get the next one.\" Customer service NOT! When we got to our room, the keys didn't work so we schlepped back down and faced an even longer line at the front desk. The same guy told us that the keys did work, we just didn't do it properly. Nevertheless, he re-keyed them and they worked the second time around. I was hoping to find lotion in the room for my bath, it's such a hassle to pack nowadays. No lotion or shampoo. Just bath gel. Our room on the 10th floor is right beside the ice machine, which crashes a load of ice every now and then during the night, waking my husband up. I'm a heavy sleeper. The heating and air-conditioning are not quiet either, whooshing on and off during the night. Because it was raining we decided to go to the Ducca bar for happy hour and were hoping to stay in for dinner. The only free table had bright spot lights trained in our eyes. I wanted a nice glass of red wine. The waiter said the wine being served for happy hour was so-so Merlot. (Begging the question, why serve it?) This is wine country, we expect more. We ordered a lemon drop and appletini. They were the worst cocktails we'd ever drunk. I complained (my husband is too nice to complain) and they actually took my drink off the final bill. We ordered 2 of the specialty drinks and they were very good -- Pomology (a pomogranite mojito) and Acai apple crisp. We decided to order brushetta, and I told our waiter we would decide whether or not to eat at the restuarant based on whether we liked the brushetta. The brushetta was delicious although the bread it came on was nearly hard enough to break your teeth. We ordered some crab cakes and an onion tart. They were okay, but not worth a trip to the restaurant we decided so we saved some calories and went to bed, deciding to go out to one of our favorite SF restaurants the following night. Because there was no coffee service in the room, I headed over to Starbucks the next morning. When I returned to the hotel, I called to make a reservation for the night. The price shot up more than $100, but the room & view are also beautiful on the 31st floor. The beds are divinely comfortable and the rooms are clean and tastefully decorated. And rooms on the 31st floor do have coffee service. I spent the day shopping while my husband was in meetings. Got a little turned around thanks to directions given by well-meaning but incorrect strangers, including a motor-cycle cop. When I attempted to call the hotel on 411, it turns out not to be listed. Spent a frustrating hour and a half, trying to find it. The other Westin on Powell street was not very helpful when I called for information, yelling at me for entering the number in my phone as they gave it to me, because it made too much noise and hurt their ears. By the time I finally got back to the hotel I wasn't happy. I went to the reception desk, where the same guy was who had checked us in was working. I told him it wasn't possible to get the Westin on Market Street through 411. He mumbled something about that not being correct. So I put my phone on speaker and dialed 411, so that I could prove that I was right. He just stared at me and didn't say anything. So I came upstairs and called the hotel manager and told her what had happened. She sent up a complimentary tray with lovely cheese and the same so so wine they were serving last night at happy hour. Tonight my husband and I are grumpy. United Airlines called to say our afternoon flight has been cancelled so we have to leave in the morning at 7:15 a.m. I wish I hadn't come on this trip. I want a little pampering when I'm away from home. We were hoping for a nice time. When customer service isn't good, it's a reflection on the management. Maybe they aren't paying their employees well enough or perhaps they aren't nice to their employees.

I should have gone back there! It was much cleaner, better-staffed, and the internet was much more reliable than at the Westin.

I specified during booking that I would need a working internet connection. When I arrived at my room, the connection didn't work (this has happened on all but one of the previous four stays I've had at the Westin). Also, it costs a considerable amount. There is no one at the hotel who can deal with internet issues, so I had to call an outside company. They couldn't fix the problem and didn't call back. Finally I was transferred to a different room. The internet did work, but the room was dirty. There were nasty stains on the wall in the bathroom, on the carpet, on the curtains. The bathroom floor hadn't been cleaned. The furniture was quite run down. These are issues I have noticed on previous stays at this hotel. I called in advance to confirm my booking (a lesson learned from previous stays at this hotel) and no one picked up the phone for two days. Sure enough, there was no record of my booking. The bottom line is that this is a hotel that skimps on staff. Overall, it took about four hours to deal with the internet and booking problems.

Best of all was that all the shopping was only a few blocks away. The staff was helpful and friendly, the beds as always, so nice. My only complaint was that the pillows and blanket gave off a cheap perfume odor. I called housekeeping the second night and told them, they said they would change out all the bedding, but the next night I still smelled it. My husband's only complaint was that room service does not offer any ala mode ice cream for late night desserts. It did seem odd that they don't carry plain old vanilla ice cream.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cA Saturday Stay in SF\u201d", "Author": "Tosh12345", "ReviewID": "UR121413900", "Content": "We stayed here for one night at the end of a business trip because the other hotel (Hilton Union Sq) was full for the final night.

The location of the hotel is very good. It is right off of Market Street where you can easily catch a Streetcar or Bus.

I had called the hotel to see about early check in and they managed to get us a room even arriving at the hotel at 10:30am. I was impressed. When we got up to the room, the safe was locked from the previous guest. I phoned down and they said they were going to send someone up right away. 40 minutes later and two more calls and we had our safe open. We went down and used the Concierge where a very rude woman gave us a rushed set of directions that turned out to be false. We went out about our day and came back around 4pm. We quickly realized why this room was available. Every so often we would hear a loud bang right next to the room. Turns out the service elevators were right beside our room and the carts would bang loudly when coming on and off the elevator. While we were in the room, a couple moved into the room on the other side of us. There was a common door between the rooms and not only could I hear her talking on the phone, I could hear the person talking to her on the phone. I was not impressed. I complained and the hotel staff upgraded our room and gave me a free breakfast. Strange to give one breakfast when there was two of us but I was back to impressed. The upgraded room had a much better view. The old room had one floor to ceiling window but the new room had two floor to ceiling windows that were facing more of the Bay. Bed was very comfortable but the rest of the room was not up to expectations. The bath room had a dual showerhead but only one of them would stay in place. The other was too loose and could not be directed. The seat and ottoman in the room had stains on them. When checking out, I went to the business centre to print off our boarding passes. You can do that for free which was great. They didn\u2019t print however. I called the tech support number and they said I needed to talk to the Concierge. When I called the lobby, they also told me I needed to get the Concierge to print off the passes because the hotel actually doesn\u2019t own the business centre and they aren\u2019t allowed to touch them. Wha?!?! Went down and talked to the same rude Concierge and got them printed but it seemed like it was a pain for her.

I shouldn't have as the check in process was smooth and upgrade was offered without having to request it. Hotel is close to SFO airport. It took me 55 minutes sharp plane door to hotel room door by taking BART (there is a station within a block from hotel) and 25-30 minutes by cab ($40-50). The room was nice, clean, and spacious (though a bit outdated) and perfectly suitable for business trip. The . Because of the upgrade it was located on a high floor reserved for SPG members and had a beautiful view of downtown SF with the bay and Alcatraz in the background. Beds were amazing and very comfortable to sleep in. There is a gym, which has all the necessary equipment, but it's nothing to write home about. However, Westin partnered up with Four Seasons to provide daily gym passes ($27/day). FS gym description looked awesome. There were several small annoyances, but the management fixed them all (some sooner, some later). 1) TV. Sound worked fine, but there was no video. We complained several times, and hotel promised to send an engineer to fix the problem, but he never showed up. Manager was apologetic about the problem and offered 2500 SPG points as compensation. 2) Internet fee ($15/day). Is it really necessary to charge $15/day internet fee in this day and age? I complained and the charge disappeared from the final bill. YMMV. 3) Aggressive maids. I think they started banging on the door each morning at 8am. As I mentioned before, all the issues were solved (I wonder if Gold SPG status mattered?) and I received several emails from different managers making sure everything was OK.

Let me start by saying the first lady we encountered at the front desk was extremely friendly and did her best to make us feel as welcome as possible. She even gave us 2 vouchers for breakfast the next morning. It basically goes downhill from there. The first night we were in a corner room. Extremely small room shaped like a V, with an even smaller bathroom. Although be view was ok, definitely not worth it on the lower floors. The next day they moved us to a Starwood preferred guest floor with a king size bed. The room was a little roomier, with a desk, and 42\" LCD TV. The bathroom was a normal size, but no big by any stretch. The room seemed very dated, like it hasn't been renovated in about 15years. The bathroom much the same, not what I expect from a Westin charging upwards of over $300. The sad part is they only gave 2 towels, and 1 piece of soap, again not what I expect for $300 a night. The other things that I find sad is that such an expensive hotel really rapes you when it comes to parking and internet. Internet is about $15/day, and parking is nearly $50 a day, more expensive than the rental car itself. If you are smart, you will park in the parking garage across the street where the parking is $21/day. Using the 1 complimentary breakfast voucher we got, I did enjoy the breakfast buffet at Ducca. The buffet is huge with a large assortment of food and drinks. The other nice thing about the hotel is it is center to all the downtown activities. Moscone center is only 2 blocks away. There is a great breakfast place call The Grove, across the street. There are a multitude of restaurants in the surrounding area. Overall, will likely not stay here again when in SF.

I had an online class that I had to attend on the following Monday. The Westin is a business hotel, they should not have these kind of issues.

It is in a pretty good location to the downtown amenities and to the transportation system. Unfortunately that is really the only thing I really liked about the hotel. I found the staff to be very rude and not willing to help. The concierge didn't give proper directions (which in turn sent us on a bit of a wild goose chase to our destination), and did not really want to look up the answers to some other questions I had. The valet and greeting staff were gruff and brushed us off when we asked for a recommendation for a quick bite to eat in the area. They never said good morning or went out of their way to be friendly. From staying at other Westins I know this isn't usually the case. As well, the men at the baggage counter were rude to my mom when she asked a quick question about the Giants. Granted they may not be Giants fans but hey, at least be a little more polite to your customers. The staff in Ducca were no better. It took 15 minutes for us to be asked what we would like to drink on our first night at the lounge. Against our better judgement, we went back to the restaurant for breakfast a few mornings later. The service was terrible, we ended up pouring our own coffee refills because we weren't given a carafe like the other tables (not sure why when they also ordered the same things we did) and the server never came to check on us. The carafe finally came when we were ready to pay our bill. The breakfast in Ducca was extremely disappointing. We chose the buffet and a lot of the food was cold, a day old or just not good (the eggs were powdered). As well, the appetizer plate we ordered at the bar was not complete (it only had about 3/4 of the items on it that were indicated on the menu). Internet cost $14.95 a day. We bought it one day, but the connection was horrible; we kept getting kicked off the system. We were also told that we could print our boarding passes for free in the business center. When we tried to however, the computer didn't recognize our airline so we had to pay to print them. When we mentioned it to the concierge, she nonchalantly told us she could have done it for us, but too bad we didn't ask. Our room was ok, but not what I expect from the Westin. There were lots of hand prints on the window, an odd big blue spot on the ceiling (it looked like shower gel or something had exploded) and a blood spot on one of the bed skirts. It was tidy but not overly clean. You could tell the floor hadn't been vacuumed under the beds or in the corners in a while. Unfortunately I wouldn't stay here again, especially for the price.

We arrived late morning and our room was not ready, but we did not expect it to be. We booked our trip through Expedia and paid for the lowest double queen we could get which meant we would be on the lower floors. When our room was still not ready at 2 pm, they offered us a room on a higher floor so we didn't have to continue waiting. We were on the 12 th floor which still gave us a nice view out the back of the hotel. We chose this hotel because of some of the hotel's features and it's location. We were not disappointed. The room was spacious enough for 2 adults and 2 teenagers. The bathroom was small, but we managed just fine. The beds were very comfortable and we really like the floor to ceiling window. Our daughter used the fitness center and said each machine had it's own tv which she really liked. There is a refrigerator in the room, but you can't really use it because it is filled with the hotel beverages that they want you to buy. If you move them, the sensor will make you pay for something you don't want, so we were not able to keep our own drinks or food cold. You do not need a car to do anything within the city from this location. You can walk to shopping, restaurants, Chinatown, AT&T ballpark. We took the cable car to The Fisherman's Wharf area, and the bus system to Golden Gate Park. We did rent a car for 3 days...also within walking distance of the hotel. We used the car to go to areas outside of the city...Sonata/Napa, Carmel, and a soccer game in Santa Clara. At night we parked the car at an indoor lot across the street from the hotel which cost a max of $23/day. It is very easy and secure, so unless you are coming for a business trip where your company is paying for parking, or you just insist that you need valet parking, I would suggest you do not park at the hotel for $48...it really is a waste of your money. The concierge service was wonderful. They not only had maps and brochures for various tours, but they took the time to map things out for us, explain the transportation system, and answer any questions we had. The hotel secured our luggage for us when we had to check out before leaving for our flight home. They also made sure we got a cab to the airport. Cabs are very easy to get outside the hotel, and the rates are very good. For four people, we actually found it cheaper to take a cab places than using the cable car system! Many of the streets in the city are one way (including the street the hotel is located on)...just keep that in mind if you plan to drive yourself around the city. We never used the hotel Internet service because we didn't want to pay extra for it, but there are many restaurants near the hotel that have free Internet access, including a Starbuck on the corner, and Mel's Diner, a couple blocks await. It is a shame that the hotel doesn't have free Internet, but we were aware of that when we booked the trip. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel to others, especially if you want a great city location.

I believe that although this hotel is still very well located (and also near from Union Square) it is much quieter than St. Francis. There were 2 complimentary bottles of water each day which was nice. I love the fragrance of the Westins lobbies, subtle but very pleasant! If I wanted to be picky I'd refer that the fabric of the sofas were a bit dirty (if you're paying the standard rate would be around $300/night and this is not admissible). I also missed the free internet that some Sheraton hotels have (Link sheraton point); nowadays, I believe this should be standard in an hotel of this category.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beijing, China", "Title": "\u201cthe standard Westin experience\u201d", "Author": "nomadsbynature", "ReviewID": "UR116020477", "Content": "As expected, the usual Westin experience.

The hotel is centrally located on Market Street and seemed to primarily cater to the business market, however, the location is great for union square and transport links.

The room itself was a great size, with good views across the city. The bed was really comfortable and large. On the flip side, the bathroom was really small and did not compare to facilities available in other starwood hotels, i.e. toilet right next to the bath and the shower being over the bath. Whilst overall the room and bathroom were very clean there were some minor points in the bathroom, like long hair on the floor and a towel and a toenail clipping on the bathroom floor. There were a couple of other minor points which took the shine off the hotel, only having two starbucks teabags and one portion of coffee in the room together with the water bottles in the room being complimentary only on the first day. Add in the lack of free wi-fi or free/cheap internet in business centre and you feel a bit cheated for a hotel of this star rating. Like another reviewer, we were also almost charged for a bottle of wine in the mini-bar which we did not consume. This charge was taken off the account with little fuss by staff. Some other reviewers have commented on the noise, which is a little surprising. This is a hotel in the centre of the city on a busy street. We also heard siren noise, but not general traffic noise. Noise level is as I would expect. There was a good happy hour in the downstairs bar and a nice patio area which appeared to be frequented by both locals and guests.

We are very easy going and have never written a complaint about a hotel so I am sorry it had to be about a Westin. The room was ok. You have to like a Heavenly Bed.

I realize other people have used the toilet and the shower before me, its a hotel, but its not really something I want to be reminded of when I get in there.........In addition to some weird stains on the perimeter of the tub, the tub itself had a disgusting yellow stain that filled the whole tub about a third of the way up............. do not know what this was.... I have attached pictures. Stains of any kind in a bathroom are a sure way to make anyone feel disgusting rather than relaxed and rejuvenated lol! Any hope for renewal and relaxation was gone the minute we went into that bathroom. I really don't know how they rent this room out but I guess it just goes to show you how they run their hotel and what they think of their guests.

Needless to say we will not be back, we will stay at the W next time, especially after housekeeping just walked into our room at 9am unannounced.

Our tub was also clogged (yuck!) the plug in the tub was stuck, called the lobby and they sent someone up to fix it right away. What maintenance basically did was popped it open with a flat head screw driver and just lefted it as is....um what if the next guest wanted to take a bath?? The other sucky thing was the elevators right next door, it hummed really really loud all night from people getting on and off. Their elevators also went really fast and stopped really abruptly so when you got off you felt like your equilibrium was all off, this happened every time we were on and off.

The hotel does seem to be keen to resolve any issues before they become problems. Like other travellers, I feel that being charged extra for internet access these days is a dinosaur from the past.

The front desk personnel were friendly and efficient, all business. I like that. The hotel lobby was busy and uncluttered, as was the front area where taxis pulled in and out. If you drive to the hotel, don't park there and pay fifty dollars plus tips, you should instead turn left on Stevenson Street right after the front of the hotel, and drive down the alley and take the first left into that parking garage where you will only pay twenty five dollars for 24 hour parking. It's clean and very cheap for the area. We loved it. The room was very clean, and she upgraded us to a Starwoods Preferred Room, on the corner of the building. It was very quiet, and so modern and attractive. We had a fabulous view and the bed was very comfortable. The amenities were great! I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to SF. The only problem with this hotel is that it is close to Market Street, and there is a lot of questionable activity on that street, so just try to avoid that and you'll be fine.

I booked 5 nights here in the beginning of October for a stay during Christmas time. Through the Westin website I found a great rate that required prepayment along with no cancellation or modification. Just fyi, the rate on the Westin site was better than Orbitz, Travelocity, Hotels.com, etc\u2026 so it's worth the time and effort to double check the hotel's website before booking. Well the day before we are to leave for San Francisco, my partner injures his back throwing some kids around on the bed. At first it seemed as if it was just a strained muscle but as the night wore one it was clear he was not going to be able to travel, he could barely get out of bed to walk around! I cancelled all of our reservations (air, car, restaurant) but when I got ready to call the Westin I recalled my reservation was not able to be cancelled or changed. But I thought perhaps I could just move the reservation a few nights\u2026 possibly if my partner's back felt better we would still make it for part of the trip and extend out a few more days\u2026 maybe someone would be in a kind mood as it was the holiday season. I ended up speaking with three different people before I talked to Justin the front desk manager. First, the 800 number customer service agent\u2026 she tried to adjust the reservation but was unable. Very nice and advised I call the hotel directly. I then spoke with someone from the hotel's reservations desk and she also attempted to change my booking with no luck. She suggested talking to the front desk directly. When I reached the front desk they passed me over to the manager. He couldn't have been more pleasant. I told him I was aware that my reservation was pretty much carved in stone, but that perhaps they could just modify it somewhat so I wouldn't be stuck with a large bill for a hotel stay that never took place. Justin went beyond that and offered me a full refund. Not once did he nor anyone I spoke with from Westin ever say my reservation absolutely could not be changed. No one had a \"too bad\" attitude, in fact just the opposite, everyone made a sincere effort to help even though it was quite clear from my reservation that I wasn't allowed to cancel or change it. To be honest I was not expecting this at all. I'm not sure they would have been so helpful had I booked through a third party site, as I've heard many stories citing that hotel staff is unable or unwilling to make certain changes when reservations are booked through alternative sites so I'm glad I booked through Westin.com. I am sad I missed out on staying at the Westin but most certainly plan to book here again when I go back to San Francisco.

The hotel generally was OK, the rooms were nice typical Westin rooms and the location was very good. The entrance area and lobby was pretty dull, it seems as if they spent more space and time designing the bar area (which is hidden from the lobby by an imposing wall) which left the entrance area unfortunately barren and cramped. The staff for the most part were more cordial than congenial compared to most places that we have stayed, although there were some nice exceptions through the stay with morning greetings and a doorman opening the door, but these were well received anomalies for our stay. Also, we only approached the concierge once, early in the trip, and was so put off by the interaction that we chose not to visit again. We were the only ones there, there were two attendants available, and our questions were pretty basic, primarily regarding the Muni system. That was very disappointing. All the above were minor detractions for us, and when Geraldine at the front desk provided assistance by obtaining a different room for our last night we were most appreciative. In fact, it was one of many highlights of our overall trip. You always hear about 'one bad apple' ruining things, but one good apple can help obscure those things mentioned above. Very nice. If you are planning on staying here, here are some specific tips: Try to get a room on the highest floor possible if you enjoy great views. We stayed on a lower one, then the higher one and the difference is amazing. Many Muni connections are less than a block away, including the retro F-line streetcars that cruise up and down Market Street, and take you directly to the Wharf. Bart is a couple of blocks, depending on where you exit the station. (The Montgomery station itself is a couple of blocks long!) Having a good game plan here will save lots of walking with luggage. The hotel isn't on Market itself, it's about an 1/2 block off, down 3rd street. We found the location to be excellent. There is a nearby Starbucks, and a little French Cafe just around the corner to get you going in the morning. Also, directly across the street is much more affordable parking. Be aware though, there are 2 garages across the street. One offers 24 hour parking for $20 while the other one claims to be $21. The $21 rate ends at 6am(regardless of when you enter) and begins again to charge at a rate of $5 per 20 mins. You may think you're getting a deal, but...... I forget the names, but the better one is the one with the large \"P\" sign that you actually park your own car, keep your keys and pay the attendant on the street level before you return to your car. Parking in SF is expensive, we only rented a car for our day trips to the coast and Napa and used Muni for everything else. It's very easy and convenient. One final tip....if you do rent a car, either rent a car with a navigation system or bring yours from home. You will greatly appreciate it as SF is pretty difficult to navigate on our own.

We sat down at the bar only to find that they quit serving at 2pm (it was Sunday), and it was now 2:05pm. So we went across the street to get a pizza. We did eat at the restaurant one evening. The waiter came up to us and told us all the things they didn't have! I almost closed my menu and left to go get more pizza! We had a salad and gave up after that! Our room was very nice, no complaints about it. We found it quite comfortable. We came back from a day of wine tasting the next day with a case of wine, however, and had to get our own rolling cart out of the lobby to get all of our stuff back into our hotel room. Not one bellhop offered to help us! So we rolled the cart upstairs to our room! And piled our luggage on it the next day (it was still outside our door)!!! The lobby is dark, dreary and needs some work, and the bell hops are terrible if you need help with luggage.", "Date": "October 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cAnother Great Westin\u201d", "Author": "laurengucsb", "ReviewID": "UR84918949", "Content": "While we don't live far from SF, we've been spending most weekends looking for an apartment in the city so as I was arrived on a late flight Friday night, we decided to head up and spend the night. We've stayed at many of the Starwood hotels in SF, but hadn't stayed here before, but if the price is right in the future, this will be our new spot. We arrived late and left our car - which is a big downside of the hotel, $54/night parking, which I have to say, is probably about right for hotel parking in the city, but still ridiculous. I forgot to turn in the public parking lot which is just around the corner and will probably charge you half as much. Although check in took a little while, the guy came back telling us he was upgrading us to a suite. We have a lot of Starwood points, and were using them this time, so often we get upgrades, but we were thrilled nonetheless, especially since we hadn't gotten a suite upgrade in the past. The room was actually a handicap accessible suite so there were certain differences, but nothing that bothered us. There wasn't a tub but that wasn't a problem for us. There was a large sitting area with double couches, TV, desk, etc, then a good size bathroom and a separate bedroom. The beds are always good - i think we'll buy the heavenly bed for our house when we finally move. We ordered room service for breakfast the next morning and it was very good, although I would say that for the price, they skimp on the sides. There were about 3 potatoes, one strawberry and half a fig. Everything was good though and the bacon was excellent. It came very quickly. Not much more to add here as we just stayed the one night, but the location is great for Yerba Buena stuff, as well as market street shopping and you can walk to the embarcadero.

The Westin is located conveniently near a bus stop and is in downtown San Fran. Union square is walking distance. There are so many restaurants and shops within a 5-10 minute walk. Even a HUGE mall. Couldn't have asked to stay at a better location as first time visitors. The suite was breathtaking. The views from our 21st floor suite left me in awe. The room was immaculate, the room had two large flat screen TVs, an amazing dual shower head in the bathroom, clean, fluffy towels, the most comfortable bed with the softest sheets and complete privacy. The staff was courteous and the luggage service was very handy since we had a late flight out of San Fran. The concierge service was extremely helpful as well. The young lady behind the counter helped us book the tours we thoroughly enjoyed throughout our trip! She helped guide us in picking the tours that best suited our needs and above all, picked us up RIGHT in front of the Westin. The Ducca restaurant's breakfast buffet is truly to be enjoyed. The variety of hot food, breads, pastries, fresh fruit, salmon, bagels, cream cheese, soups forced me to go back for seconds. The orange juice tasted fresh squeezed, the coffee was hot, and perfectly brewed. All in all, the Westin made our first trip to San Fran a very memorable experience.

Cleanliness: During our stay the room was cleaned daily and we were provided fresh linens and replacement soaps in a consistent and timely manner. The hallways and lobby also appeared well kept. The windows overlooking the promenade could use a good Windex by housekeeping. Location: I was in-town for a conference and this was one of the recommended hotels. The hotel is located in the financial district. During the week the streets were very busy and the hotel was within convenient walking distance to buses and other ground transportation.

Service: Front desk was very friendly and professional. Management could revisit the concierge desk. The gentleman that assisted us with our weekend excursions was not friendly, at all, and gave us the impression we were bothering him. Either he was clearly in the wrong job or he was having a bad day. Value: I used Starwood Points for the week which I believe was 10,000 points a night.

The discounted weekend rate is likely because of its location in the financial district which becomes very quiet on the weekends. Sleep Quality: Bed was very comfortable and thermostat worked fine.

I travel to SF 1 - 2 x's a year, staying 5-7 days for business. This will be by 3rd year in row to stay at this Westin--but I will not be returning after this. Normally I book through the hotel direct, but recently my company set a mandate to use Expedia Corporate for bookings. At check-in I was told I would be on the 6th floor. The hotel has 35 floors so I requested a high floor for views--where I normally stay. It was explained that since I booked with Expedia, that I would have to have a lower floor. Being a Starwood preferred guests; I mentioned I should have a complimentary upgrade. The a lady at check in said the best she could do would be a handicap room on a higher floor but it has a queen bed instead of my King reservation. I reluctantly took the handicap room. Upon entry I was disappointed in the hospital/urine smell, no bath tub, and very limited counter space (not even enough for my toiletry bag). However at this point, I was so tired and the desk worker was not in a helpful mood, I decided to move my room tomorrow. The next morning I noticed the room did not have an ironing board. I requested one and it took almost 30 minutes to have it delivered, making me nearly late for my meeting. After lunch my client decided to stop by the hotel lobby for an informal work session. The wi-fi fee is $15 a day--since I had already signed up, I asked the front desk for the promo code for free wi-fi for my client. I was told non-guests were not allowed use of the wi-fi. So I said, \"Okay let's try this again...let's say my husband needs Wi-Fi and I have already purchased it, how do we get him a code?\" The desk worker said \"your husband' would have to buy another wi-fi access. She further explained the fee is per person, not per room. \"So let me get this straight, in addition to the $500 for the room, the $100 for parking, and the $75 I have already paid for Wi-Fi, you want me to give you even more?\" I thanked the lady for not being helpful and walked away. I was baffled by the lack of customer service that I was not use to at a Westin. After 8 hrs of meetings, I came back very tired thinking a nice bath would be nice--but oh yeah--my room doesn\u2019t have one. So I requested a room change again. Again, I was told I would have to move to the lowest floor since I booked \"with Expedia\". It was like I had been blacklisted--every time they looked my up and saw I booked through Expedia, suddenly I became someone they didn\u2019t want to help. I truly felt snubbed by each of the 3 desk workers. Customer service is important to me and this hotel has opted to treat certain guests differently so for that reason, I will be checking out and not returning.", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cExcellent experience\u201d", "Author": "KatieM13", "ReviewID": "UR64745978", "Content": "We arrived early to San Francisco and we were not only allowed to check in early (11:30am), but were able to upgrade to a room on the 33rd floor with a MUCH better view.

The corner unit is V-shaped. Despite being so awkwardly shaped they did a great job designing it and making it functional.

I asked to be switched and was again given the best room spiel and given the same type of room on 33. It seems that the bathroom ventilation fans never turn off so you'll have to remember to shut the door if you are sensitive to it as I am.

We ate there twice at dinner and once for breakfast. The oriental guy supposed to put water on our glasses, many times fulled the glass more than possible, sreading water at the table. The same with the olive oil, he spread oil at the table too, not because he fulled it but because his movements were too terrible. One day we got breakfast there. When we\u00b4ve just seated, the waitress asked our order, so we said we would like to see the menu for options, and she looked at her watch for a long time and said breakfast time was about to finish. My husband asked her what was breakfast hours (we had already confirmed it at the reception desk before entering the restaurant), and told her we still had twenty minutes and it would not take longer. After she brought the juices, coffee and bread basket we ordered, she asked if we would charge to the room, and gave us the check. It can\u00b4t happen in a hotel like this. Staff must be more polite, she could have said the same (that we didn\u00b4t have long time for breakfast ) in an elegant way. Now, the grand finale: The day after, we were having dinner at the restaurant and I saw a mouse!!! It appeared, took something at the floor and desappeared. I was so astonish... I told the waiter very quietly and he was not surprised, he said he would ask someone to take care of it. Just that, normal face: it seemed to us that for him it is perfectly normal to have a mouse at a restaurant .

I was surprised when she gave me a room on the 22nd floor. When I made the reservation, it said I would get a room on the 4th to 7th floors. From the 22nd floor (which is not the highest, 36 is), you can still get some stunning views of San Francisco from one huge floor-to-ceiling window. The room was connected to another room, which is something I don't like, but at least the connecting door was close to the main door, and not in the center of the room. The Internet was way too expensive, $14.95 for a day. Didn't touch the minibar after a notice said the hotel would start charging after 10 seconds if the minibar was touched. Was happy to see there is a safe in the room, I can leave my laptop there. And the bathroom had plenty of towels. It's a nice hotel. I wonder if some employees at this hotel were ever affected by the recession. When I asked what was the cheapest way to get from the hotel to the airport, the concierge told me after discount, I can take the town car for $45. After the financial crisis and recession, the economy may be improving but that does not mean people have money to throw away. If I can take Bart to SFO for $8 and arrive exactly where I want, without any more walking, why would I be interested in paying $45? What I expected them to say is, \"we can get a cab for you\" for $23.

We arrived at SFO from LA around 8am and used the BART to get into the city centre. It took around 30 minutes and you can either get off at the Powell or Montgomery Street stations. The Westin is about half way between both stations and is about a 5 minute walk. I would recommend the BART as an alternative to a shuttle or taxi. Not only is it fun and adds to the adventure but its also easy to use and follow and is totally safe. Because it was early morning when we arrived at the hotel we were originally hoping to have our bags placed in storage until we could check in. To our surprise the very friendly staff member allowed us to check in early as well as provide us with a 2pm check out time. We were on the 24th floor which provided us with superb views of the city and alcatraz. The room itself was great and very spacious. One thing I would advise is be careful of the mini bar fridge. Don't bump or remove any of the items because there is no time delay on the products and you end up getting charged. Once again the friendly staff member at the front counter was only too obliging to remove the charge from our account. There is a gym on the 4th floor which is complementary. It is well equipped with weight machines and cardio equipment. We didn't eat at the Restaurant or use room service. The Westin is right in the heart of the city centre and is only a 5-10 minute walk to the trams and shopping centre. The F line tram which takes you to Fishermans Wharf is less than a 2 minute walk. We have nothing but good things to say about the Westin and its staff, accomodation and location. We highly recommend it to others. The only negative I have which does not involve the Westin or SF is United Airlines. We flew with UAL from LA to SF. All I can say is this airline sux. Their customer service sux, their timeliness sux, their staff are rude, arrogant and unhelpful. In general their overall performance is pathetic and also sux.

Would have been easier if we could have just temporarily moved the stuff in the minibar fridge out but they have one of those sensors that charges you when something gets moved, so we didn't try it.

My husband and kids joined me for the trip even though I was attending conferences for most of the time, and they had the cable car terminus, union square, and the Yerba Buena park all within a 5 min walk. A BART station is also right nearby. We also took the F cable car down to the market at Embarcadero. The food stands there are amazing -- just too bad it isn't open for longer hours. For anyone going to a convention at the Moscone center, it is 1 block away. We ate twice at restaurants that were within walking distance of the hotel and had been recommended by the concierge. I thought both were uninspiring. We had thought about eating at the restaurant downstairs but the menu was rather pricey and their prix fixe menu (one night a week) only had 2 choices for entrees, both red meat which I don't eat.

We didn't have breakfast at the hotel - Starbucks is just up the street if all you want is a coffee and pastry- but we did have a very good , if rather expensive, meal at \"Ducca\". My only complaint would be that our room was right next to the service elevators that rumbled noisily up and down late at night and early in the morning. I presume that our room allocation was due to the fact that we had got an absolutely fantastic rate on Expedia, which I imagine gives the hotel some scope to allocate better -placed rooms to those paying the full whack. All in all our stay was very pleasant, and if we're ever back in SF ( it's a long way from France!) and get a similar deal, then I'd stay there again.", "Date": "October 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cDecent place if you get a decent deal\u201d", "Author": "SpoonAmerica", "ReviewID": "UR45524007", "Content": "I stayed there with my gf for 4 nights.

Approx. $50 for parking per night seems like highway robbery to me, no matter what city it's in, or how nice the hotel is! The staff at the front desk were courteous and the bellman was pleasant. The room was nicely decorated and the beds were fairly comfortable. On the first night of our stay however the guests next door were partying and drinking which turned into screaming and hollering in some type of domestic dispute at around 1am. I was on the verge of calling the police when I called down to the front desk at 1:30am. No one from security ever showed up and our noisy neighbours finally quieted down around 2:30am. When I complained to the front desk the next morning nothing was done. They simply blamed it on \"unruly guests\". The walls between the rooms are thin so noise travels well, and the heavy metal room doors also slam loudly which echoes down the hall anytime a guest leaves their room. This hotel has the typical overpriced minibar ($5 for a can of soda?) and they also charge $15 per day for wireless internet. In this day and age that's just poor service. If the cafe on the corner can offer free wireless, so can the Westin. There is a convenience store next door that sells soda and snacks so skip the minibar and save yourself from the price gauging. In the end we were highly disappointed by our stay, feeling overcharged and undervalued as guests.

This I had no problems with, the desk clerk was excellent, and made sure I was moved to another room. I did find the diningroom staff at breakfast to be somewhat less than congenial, they seemed put out when asked for something, such as cream for the coffee.

Like New Orleans, this was a recently remodeled hotel (formerly called The Argent), but had been given a pretty thorough Westin makeover. The lobby rooms are totally Westin-ized, with very comfy Heavenly beds, clean-lined furniture, stark white walls, large flatscreen TV, and upscale bathroom. Actually the rooms are a very good size for a hotel like this, definately wider than usual. We were three guys, and were able to fit a (very comfy) cot into a room with 2 double beds, with plenty of room to spare. Over the course of 3 nights, this was actually a very comfortable layout. Bathroom shower pressure very good, cutains were effective at blocking out light from the sun, and the closet was nice with upscale wooden hangars. Bathroom amenities were Westin's Heavenly Bath brand, but didn't include a liquid body wash, which surprised me (used the shamproo instead). Towels were plentiful and very fluffy. As for the rest of the hotel, didn't use much of it. Had a drink one night out on the terrace of Ducca, the hotel's restaurant. Was surprisingly quiet, thought the place would be more of scene. Restaurant furniture was pretty chic and the restaurant's terrace was a nice amenity. One of the other guys ordered room service breakfast, which came very promptly, and he was satisfied. I had a package dropped off at the front desk with just my name on it, and the hotel had it sent up to the room which was nice. All in all, very pleased. Only one thing I would comment on was they put us in a room next to the service elevators, and you can mildly hear them race up and down the elevator shaft at certain times.

If you take the BART from either the San Francisco or Oakland airports simply depart at the Montgomery Station and walk about two blocks, and the hotel is right there!

The room itself was nice, spacious and clean and nice view of the SOMA district from the 29th floor! I also used the fitness center at the hotel, and thought it was nice too ...

Once again, I want to personally thank Eric Pasch for my incredible experience at this hotel and i truly hope to be back very, very soon!", "Date": "July 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cWestin Say It Aint So\u201d", "Author": "SFNative80", "ReviewID": "UR35116841", "Content": "This hotel must not be corporate managed hence, I ask the question \"Westin say it aint so?\" Mouse traps outside the building!!!!

When I arrived I asked to change my room type and my request was granted. I was nervous when I saw that my room was next to the elevator but unlike other reviewers I had no problem with the elevator sounds at all. It was slight background noise and it wasn't bad at all. At other hotels you'd be lucky if the street noise was as tolerable. I hate noisy hotels and I found this hotel to be very quiet over four nights. The room had a simple yet modern look with a huge window with great views. It was perfectly clean. The beds were wonderful. Often I dislike the super comfy hotel beds but the Westin beds were perfect. The bathroom was clean and a nice size as well. The hotel location was ideal.

My husband commented to the front desk clerk that he is a Starwood Gold member, upon which the front desk clerk disappeared to the back for a couple minutes. When he returned, he upgraded us to a king room and suggested we book directly with the hotel instead of using a 3rd party such as Hotwire next time to guarantee a better room.

We stay at Westins often, so it would have been interesting to have ended up someplace else.) The room was on a corner and had amazing views. The decor was typical Westin, except it was odd that the room lacked a sofa/loveseat--instead it had two dining chairs, which was awkward. The bathroom was ridiculously small, and they should replace the hinged door with a pocket door. Thank goodness the sink was outside the toilet/shower area or we never would have been able to get ready! This was also the first Westin I've stayed in where there were no robes in the closet.

It couldn't compare with the Westin St. Francis which promises to make your children feel welcome (wecome pkg, etc.). There is not a speck of personal service or attention here. I have always thought of the Westin as a nice hotel and this trip changed my mind. It falls under the Marriott. I will admit that I stayed in a Hampton Inn overnight on a road trip, once, and the room & service was as nice or nicer than this. Our children are the quietest, most well-behaved children (per others) and they said they didn't feel welcome there and actually complained when we pulled into the Westin SF Airport on our last night. Luckily, we spent most of our time out of our room, because it was nothing special and not as nice as our home. The floors were also pretty dirty. The \"large\" windows were not as large as most hotels where I've stayed and the view was bad...and I am a Starwood member; which obviously means nothing. We also had 2 charges that were not ours but they took them off without question and very nicely...they were so obviously not our charges. Room service breakfast was also speedy and friendly. You also have to ask for toiletries. Typically, one would find a shower cap and body soap, but the rooms are only stocked with shampoo and hand soap - nothing more. The recession has hit the hotels! Our room did NOT have the heavenly beds either. They were not great actually; we know heavenly beds, and did have them following our stay when we went to the airport Westin, and the difference is discernable. I can't imagine we just got a bad room. Do not take restaurant recommendations from the concierge; do your own homework! We had a restaurant picked out and the concierge told us she knew of a better one. We should have been clued in when she gave us a post it to give the owner with his name and her full name on it. It wasn't very good and was filled with tourists. Not a single ethnic person in a Chinatown restaurant!?! It was not good and she was obviously getting a kickback from them. (I believe in the form of chinese takeout!) We were unhappy. All in all, if you can get a cheap room and do not want anyone to talk to you from the hotel, stay here.

All but this one were fantastic. This one was a disappointment. We arrived from New York on Dec 29 after a delayed flight and were so tired that we did not check the room(869). As I tried to get to sleep I kept hearing a noise that I put down to the cable cars outside on Powell Street. At 2am I realised that the noise was not the cable car but the elevator and our room was directly behind the elevator shaft!! On thinking back to the checkin I remembered the woman behind the desk grimacing when she saw what room she was giving us and a slight look of panic as she handed us the room keys. At 6am, after getting no sleep I rang down to the front lobby to get a change of room as we were staying 4 nights and the room was too noisy. The clerk on the front desk asked what room I was in. I told him and he said he understood perfectly. He told me we could go to 874 and I should come down to reception to get the keys. After packing our bags and moving them to outside 874 (at the other end of the hotel) I went down to the lobby to drop off the old keys and pick up the new ones. I asked the clerk if 874 was next to an ice machine, stairs, elevator etc and he said \"I wouldn't do that to you, brother. I'll just make sure\". He opened a drawer and consulted a sheet of paper which I guess contained all the Priceline rooms. It took him 15 minutes of consulting the computer and the sheet of paper before giving me the keys to room 867 (two rooms from the first room, 869). So I went back up to the 8th floor, told my partner that we had to move the bags back to the other end of the hotel. I wondered what was wrong with 874. So, after carrying our bags all the way back to the other end of the hotel, I opened the door to 867 to find the new room was a lot smaller than the first one and we had been downgraded from a king-size bed to a queen. I rang the front desk again and was told that I was given a standard room with a queen bed and the only standard rooms with a king size bed were next to the elevator shaft. I am 6'6\" tall and am used to sleeping in a king sized bed but having had no sleep that night I resigned ourselves to this room. The room did not appear that clean- it looked like it had not been vacuumed in quite a while (there was visible dust and the bath looked like it had not been cleaned with a creme cleanser in a while). Little did I know this was just the start of our hygiene problems. On New Years Eve, the 8th floor rooms started filling up with what appeared to be frat aged guests. The hotel was hosting a New Years party and the atmosphere became quite lively which I enjoyed. In the early morning we stepped out of our room to go on a tour to find a pool of vomit just outside our neighbor's door. A few more yards along another pool of vomit and then another one just outside the elevator. I thought I should mention this to the front desk as it would be hours before the housemaids would be coming around. With the smell still in my nostrils I mentioned this to the woman behind the front desk. She did not look surprised and asked if we would like another room. I said no as I had already been moved and I was just mentioning this as it should be cleaned up as soon as possible. I told her where the vomit was. She consulted her computer. After a few seconds she said \"Priceline\" to herself out loud without looking at me and opened a drawer. She removed a couple of complementary coffee coupons from the drawer and asked if could she offer me them in apology. I said no thank you but felt quite insulted by her manner. First of all, a coffee costs 20c to produce and secondly, she categorized me by the fact I was a Priceline customer. When we returned to the room that evening the \"solid\" bits of the vomit had been cleaned up but the smell and stains were still there. I rang the \"Express Service\" number and mentioned it to them. Two hours later, after no action, I asked one of the housemaids cleaning a room next door (late checkout) to address it. The stain outside my room was shampoo'ed but not the others. Is \"Express Service\" an oxymoron at Westin?? In our travels around the U.S we used a mix of Priceline, Hotwire and hotel chain websites to get good value rates. In comparison to to other hotel chains where I received excellent service and value for money I don't think I can recommend Westin either for this hotel or their approach to service. On the plus side, the hotel is the oldest hotel in San Francisco and oozes history. Have a look in the ballrooms get get a feel of the old San Francisco. The location is perfect in Union Square. You can walk from the Market Street BART station (3 blocks slightly uphill) straight from the airport. Only $4.35 each. P.S I lodged the above comments via their website and got a response email offering me 5.000 (sic) points Starwood Guest Points.

Hell, I had an actual work desk, a 32-inch (or maybe it was larger) LCD TV, two very comfy lounging chairs, a full mini-bar, a full closet, and, a king size heavenly bed. The room even had a small ante-room leading to the main bedroom! (The fact that I paid considerably less per night for the Westin compared to the Hotel Mela sweetened the deal considerably.) I should also mention that the room was very clean. I quite liked the lobby and the hallways. Further, the location was very convenient to the SF MOMA, the Moscone Convention Center, Yerba Buena Gardens, and shopping (Westfield San Francisco Center. Virgin Mega Store, Apple Store, ROSS, and Old Navy, to name a few.) Some stuff to note, however: (a) the bathroom was plain jane. Nothing distinguishing about it at all. (b) some of the extras I was hoping for were AWOL. No complimentary bottled water. No slippers. No shower gel. No toothbrush kit. No sewing kit. No shower cap. None of that mattered (well, except maybe for the complimentary bottled water) to me though since I had the necessary toiletries with me. (c) I got charged for mini-bar consumption despite my not having actually consumed anything from the mini-bar. Apparently, as explained to me by the front desk, the fridge has an electronic sensor such that, the minute you move anything in the fridge, you're automatically charged for consumption. As such, when I moved stuff around to accomodate perishables I'd bought, I got charged. (I'm not sure I actually believe the front desk's explanation by the way. The electronic fridge system, if it actually exists, just seems like a great way for the hotel to get into unncessary arguments with guests.) In any case, the hotel reversed the charges without giving me a tough time about it. So, I'm not complaining. (d) I came back one day to find a cleaning rag left behind by housekeeping on top of a cabinet. No biggie for me, I just placed the rag along with my used towels, but I can envision how such an episode could irritate other less sanguine guests. (e) The lifts had a key card security system to control access to the guest floor. However, the system was apparently not yet up and running during my stay. Lastly, I should mention that I was able to book my room for about USD180 (including tax) a night directly through the SPG website. Considering that the average room rate in San Francisco for a hotel of this quality seems to be closer to USD250 ++ per night (based on my own research), the size and quality of the room, and the locaiton of the hotel, I feel that I got a very good deal indeed.", "Date": "October 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Gatos", "Title": "\u201cLoud Loud Loud Elevator Noise!\u201d", "Author": "trip2sf", "ReviewID": "UR20861701", "Content": "There is just no excuse for a Hotel of this quality to have such a serious problem with the elevator system.

I only found out the room was ready because my wife went back and asked. *) Evidently my room (which was booked by someone else) included free valet parking. The hotel never told me it was included. How did I find out? My wife randomly asked about the room rate and they happened to mention the free parking. *) The laundry service . . .

They did not meet their time committment, and didn't bother to call or apologize. As if that isn't enough, this is the big one.

I am fairly local (just over an hour away) and I have to say that this hotel is an outstanding value for anyplace in the Bay Area, let alone San Francisco, and let alone Union Square! You can not go wrong. I booked the hotel directly with the hotel website. If you compare all the sites and prices, you will find that the hotel's own prices are the most reasonable, so I recommend booking directly. I was a little worried when I read some of these traveler reviews, but it is as if the negative posts stayed someplace else. Every detail was beyond satisfactory. I'll start at the beginning. We parked across the street at the Hearst Parking Garage. 24 hour parking cost only $20--um excuse me, actually this is cheap!! It is safe and secure and literally across the street. Just map everything before you go and you will find it alright. When we checked in, the clerk read my special comments and without asking, she upgraded us from a Grand Deluxe King room to a Premier King at no extra charge. We were on the 29th floor. The floor to ceiling windows make for a breathtaking view of Yerba Buena Gardens, the Metreon, Zeum carousel, the bay (even AT & T park if you know what to look for) and the hills of San Francisco. Imagine that at night time, with the lights. Just fantastic. I highly recommend asking for a room that faces Yerba Buena Gardens. Some of the complaints here were that the view of 3rd Street did not impress and I would agree, that if we had a room facing 3rd, it would NOT be the same experience. But remember, you get what you pay for. The Grand Deluxe rooms clearly state, \"High Floor.\" The bed looks exactly like the online photos and is extremely clean. That is precisely what I look for in a hotel, is cleanliness. The bathrooms are large, spacious, fully stocked with a hair dryer, bath robe in the closet, etc. The large screen tv, well stocked mini bar all says chic, elegant, modern. That is what you will get from the minute you walk into this hotel: modern elegance. From the huge white orchids in the lobby to the hotel lounge with the urban vibe, it delivers upscale taste at an extremely reasonable price. I can tell you that the price for a standard room here compares to that of a far inferior room in the wharf area (such as a Best Western.) As to other hotels in the Market Street area, you are looking at THE best priced hotel for the value in the area. This place can't be beat! Quality and affordability. You are getting upscale, quality service for a bargain rate. The concierge was helpful. Cabs come straight up to the door and took us to the Curran theatre, which was a $5 cab ride away. Everything is in walking distance. If you leave the hotel, go left to Market and left again and walk to Union Square. Go right out of the hotel and you are steps away from the SF Museum of Modern Art, the Metreon, St Patrick's Cathedral, Jewish Museum of Art, Yerba Buena Gardens (beauiful), Zeum, and the Children's Carousel. This location puts the value of the hotel far beyond the price they are charging. From the time we walked up to the front desk clerk, who upgraded our room in celebration of my husband's birthday, and offered him a glass of wine to boot, to the convenient parking across the street to the LOCATION beyond belief, to the cleanliness of the room and the comfort of the beds: I highly recommend this hotel! Note: if you are looking for a \"historic\" looking hotel, then you want to stay at the Westin St Francis or the Sir Francis Drake. That is an entirely different type of experience. At the Drake (where I've also stayed) the rooms are small and the bathrooms are closet small. But you are at a historic, older building.

Second, there really is no comfortable common area in the hotel to relax and spend time. One tip I read about which saved us a lot of money. Parking at the hotel is $49 per day. We parked across the street at the Hearst Parking Garage for $20 per day. Although that lot does not have in/out privileges, and is not open 24 hours per day, that did not matter to us because we did not use our car while in SF. All in all, we enjoyed this hotel and would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "July 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGood experience\u201d", "Author": "MongDublin", "ReviewID": "UR18093676", "Content": "Fantastic location to view a wonderful city.

AT&T Park is 15-20 minutes walk straight down the street from hotel or about 10 minutes on the F maket trolley. I had not been to a baseball game before but I am a sports fan. My daughters ( 17 and 14 ) were not. They loved the experience so much we also went on the BART to Oakland a few days later to catch another game. Book Alcatraz at least a week before you visit. Well worth the money, very interesting. Don't bother with a car , use public transport. We got a car only when leaving SF. Lots of car rental offices about 800 yards away. We travelled south towards LA. If going on a similar trip catch the \"Mystery Spot\" in Santa Cruz on the way south. Entry $5/person and $5 for parking, well worth it, a great laugh.

Overall, we thought we 'shop' around in terms of hotels: we stayed at the Mandarin Oriental (by far the best hotel with impeccable service and amazing views from the rooms), the Fairmont (grande dame of hotels in San Fran, but really no longer up to scratch with its facilities) and the Westin. First of all, I rang the hotel to confirm that we would get a king size room on the upper floors as set out in our booking. However, upon our arrival (which was at 20.45pm - the hotel was aware of that) we were told that this was impossible and also never confirmed. When I saw the room we got (next to the lifts), I went back down to the lobby and requested a change (which we eventually got after much debate). By 21.30, we unpacked and went to the receptionist (who had been exceptionally rude upon check-in) and asked whether there would be any good restaurants in the area that would still be open (it was a Tuesday night after all). The answer: he did not know (he was the receptionist and concierge at the time!), but there would be a 7/11. Tired of arguing with hotel staff that clearly did not like their job, we went out and around the corner to the Four Seasons where I explained the situation (sorry, should have stayed at your hotel, we are stuck with the Westin now and an incompetent concierge) and their (friendly) concierge pointed out three closeby restaurants which were open and the one we chose was a real hit! I am not going into any further detail of what else happened when we stayed at the Westin (wrong final bill - when I pointed it out, they acted as if it was MY fault that the bill was wrong and they generally could not care less), but it was one of the most irritating hotel stays I have ever had (and I travel around the world a lot as part of my job). As a general rule (by now): when hotels start giving their mattresses or showers special names (heavenly bed or heavenly shower), just stay away from it.

Our breakast server was very good and attentive to our needs. We arrived back late one night right about closing time for the restaurant and we wanted to order dessert. They allowed us to which was very nice and the desserts themsleves were just OK. I really only had 2 issues with the hotel, we stayed in room 405 and for the entire stay we never had a trash can in the bathroom, only under the desk which is unusual. Also, every night we stayed the room attendant short sheeted the bed by 2 inches. I dno't know if the sheets they buy are too short or if this attendant is making the bed wrong but being six foot five it became annoying to constantly rub your feet on the mattress and mattress pad.

Hope this is of help to someone! We thought our (10 day) stay at the Westin Market street location was fair for the price. We found a special on Expedia, and the value was good- I believe that it worked out to be around 150$ Canadian, per night, taxes included. I think we likely had the least expensive type of room. The highlights were an EXTREMELY comfortable bed, a great location, and the outdoor terrace located beside the restaurant. The terrace provided a small, quiet haven in the middle of a bustling city and you could order drinks, food, or even bring your own items and enjoy the atmosphere. There is a gym in the hotel and it has enough equipment to provide you with a fair workout while away. We ate at the hotel's restaurant \"Ducca\" one night and also quite enjoyed that. To elaborate more on the location, we found it very convenient. It's right downtown, with endless great restaurants and the major shopping section just around the corner. Chinatown is also a very short walk away. A short cab ride will take you to the wharf, telegraph hill, Mission Delores, etc.. We are big walkers so we walked to these sites- but they are around a 45 minute walk and more in some cases so not for the weary! Cable cars (as well as other modes of transport) are all around and probably a more fun way of travelling to your chosen site. The only drawback of being in such a central location would be the noise level. Market and 3rd streets are busy - the traffic & the frequent sound of sirens were well heard within our 7th floor room- which faced the street. Maybe a room which doesn't directly face the street might help somewhat. We got used to the noise, and the really comfortable beds do help to encourage restful sleep for the most part. Also- the rooms are not huge but we found them fair enough for our purposes. Lastly, for those looking to vacation in San Fran like we did - I want to mention that we really enjoyed the Alcatraz tour (great audio guide available), a wine tour through Tower Tours (67$ pp 3 wineries & tastings incl), renting a car through Budget car rental (5 minutes walk away on Howard) and driving down the scenic HWY 1 (not to be missed if you have the time), as well as dinner at the Cliff House restaurant overlooking the Pacific. And my last comment is that the Museum of Modern Art is current showing Frida Kahlo's work which was such a pleasant surprise. This museum is literally a 3 minute walk from the hotel.

My fianc\u00e9 and I stayed in San Francisco for 5 nights in June 2008. Overall the Westin on Market served us well \u2013 thought I\u2019ll be the first to admit we don\u2019t spend much time in the hotel room when we travel! Location: Excellent. Right in the hub of Downtown, just off Market Street. Between two BART stations (which I\u2019d recommend for ease of use, speed & low cost from SFO airport). 5 minutes to Union Square, 5 minutes to Westfield Shopping Centre (huge!), 5 minutes to the two major Tourist Tram stops, get the idea? You\u2019ve got buses, streetcars and trams within a few minutes walk that service the majority of the City, and public transport is pretty decent (and relatively cheap) in San Fran so there\u2019s no reason not to use it. You\u2019re also near a number of the big conference venues, as well as the Yerba Buena Gardens \u2013 a very pleasant city park! This was our major factor for choosing the hotel and it didn\u2019t disappoint. Amenities / Rooms: We had a standard Queen-bed room on the lower floors, but asking politely at the front desk got us moved up to a higher floor, corner room with nice City views \u2013 a good start! Room was well equipped, good TV with plenty of channels, nice bathroom and a very comfy bed. Soap / Shampoo etc all good quality and a free daily USA Today. Our room was a little crowded, but it wasn\u2019t a problem for us. Good quality Starbucks Coffee / Tea, however we had a gripe with the paper cups (it\u2019s a hotel \u2013 not a coffee shop!) - it took us 2 days and a couple of conversations with housekeeping before they would bring us proper mugs \u2013 not flimsy paper things \u2013 though I appreciate the business traveller may want the convenience of coffee to go. The fianc\u00e9 said the shower wasn\u2019t hot at times, though I never noticed myself. Lastly for international travellers \u2013 the hotel doesn\u2019t provide complimentary power adapters, so don\u2019t forget yours from home like we did! The rest of the hotel was very pleasant, nice lobby / lounge area with a fireplace(!) and a good bar \u2013 however we didn\u2019t try the restaurant or the gym \u2013 so can\u2019t comment there! Service: Everyone at the hotel was great, housekeeping were very pleasant (we had to call for coffee / tea top-ups nearly every day, they only replace the packets once a day) and very quick to respond to requests for extra hangers and the like. As I said the only problem was getting proper mugs instead of paper cups \u2013 which did take a few calls to different people before they\u2019d help us! Lastly the Concierge was very pleasant and helpful with the couple of queries we had. General San Fran: Hit the major tourist spots (Alcatraz, Haight Ashbury, Fishermans Wharf, Chinatown etc) as they\u2019re all worth seeing, but book Alcatraz in advance as it sells out often! Nob\u2019s Hill is great for some views down the very steep streets.

Book a two-bed room-its the same price. Obviously, there are noisy, windy rooms but our rooms were very clean and quiet, despite the wind. Rooms were located away from the elevators, midway down the hall, not in an alcove. No view except for the rooms on the 7th floor. The hotel is not pet-free. Members of our group have allergies and we were lucky that no one reacted to any dander that may have been left behind. We asked for non-feather bedding. Did not eat in hotel.

We particularly wanted to be as high as possible (within our budget) and overlooking the city skyline. We arrived around 8pm and upon checking in asked to be put as high up as possible. The receptionist told us he had a room on the 32nd floor as someone hadnt turned up and it was now available. We were delighted, he tapped away on the computer and gave us our keys.... for a room on the 14th! I challenged this and asked about the room he had just mentioned on floor 32 and he said he couldnt give us that as it was allocated to another guest and assured us that he had given us one of the best rooms in the hotel. Too tired to argue, we accepted. The room on floor 14 overlooked the Yerba Buena gardens and a ground level building site which is immediately behind the hotel. Beds were fine, but the shower curtain was hanging off the rail and the water level in the toilet bowl was so high that you almost got wet when you sat on the loo! there was only one bathrobe supplied and the towels were a bit on the sparse side. We stayed there for the night and tried again at reception the following morning. We were told to leave our packed cases in the room and they would be moved to an alternative room by the time we came back from sightseeing in the afternoon. You guessed it, we came back around 4pm, asked at the desk and clearly nothing had been done. We were found a room on floor 26 but had to move our own luggage which I thought was a bit much given that the foyer is swarming with door staff, cocierges and bell boys! Overall the reception staff were a bit aloof... not the sort of service i was expecting really. The new room was identical to the other one, just higher up. The bathroom was in a better condition but still only one robe was supplied and again the number of towels seemed rather mean. We never got our city skyline views, bit the view from the back of the hotel over the Yerba Buena gardens, Moscone Centre and the bay in the distance was nice. We experienced the creaking of the hotel later in the week when the wind was really high (mentioned by another reviewer) but it wasnt an issue at all and not loud enough to disturb. We also experienced the fire alarm but were allowed to stay in our room until the hotel had checked it out and we were told it was a false alarm due to a problem in the garage. All of this was done over a PA system in the room.. very efficient and we were pleased not to have to walk down 26 flights. We didnt use the restaurent, way too expensive for anyone not on a business expense account! Breakfast items were individually priced and franky outrageous. There is a starbucks, a pizza restaurent, a Subway and a well stocked deli immediately outside the hotel so getting supplies to use in the room room isnt a problem. The mini bar is overpriced as is usually the case with hotels. The day before we left, i asked the guy who looked after the door how much time to allow for a cab to get to the airport during rush hour. He asked when we were leaving and said he would be on the door and would arrange for us to use the hotel limo as it was free. I took this to mean it was complimentary but when we arrived at the airport we were told the fare was 40 dollars! Thats more than a cab and I felt we had been misled somewhat. Beware if you are offered this service. It was nice to travel in style but you'll pay extra for it. So, positives: Great location Comfortable beds - and you can have a change of bedlinen every day if you want it. Fire alarm handled well. Negatives Reception staff aloof and not very efficient Problems with initial check in and subsequent move Charges for limo service not made clear. Breakfast prices outrageous.

The main reason I chose to stay there was a) the great location for shopping, and b) the decent/above average reviews on TA, and c) because I'm an SPG Gold Member. I went ahead and booked a Deluxe King Corner Room thinking that sounded pretty nice and a definite upgrade on the standard Kings..boy was I wrong. Let me back up though. Indeed the Westin is very well positioned just off Market Street on 5th. It's a great spot not only to head out shopping for the day but also is a little less scary then a few blocks north up towards the Tenderloin (where a number of big chain hotels are.) The building itself is modern and the lobby is clean and functional. We were checked in and recognised as Gold Members and everything seemed to be fine. Unfortunately when we got to the room we discovered that our 'upgraded' Deluxe Corner room was certainly not on the corner and looked like a standard King at best. I immediately went down to the front desk to only be told that I not only was in an upgraded room, but this room was an upgrade on the one I'd booked! After many discussions and the usual 'we're booked solid so can't move you' routine, we let it go. TIP: Be sure to triple check the room type you want/book..it is very easy to be fooled into thinking you're getting more then you are! This being said the room was fine and clean, although the bathroom was hardly what I'd called 'upgraded' and certainly not up to the dozens of Westins I've stayed in around the world. The gym was decent although small, but the bar downstairs was lively on the Saturday night and the staff fantastic.

The location is excellent, between Union Square and Moscone Center, and one block from the subway. Someone complained about noise in a review, but if you're staying in the heart of a big city how can you possibly expect it to be quiet? We were on the 9th floor, so we didn't hear too much noise anyway. Our room was spacious, nicely furnished, and the mattress was very comfortable. The bed linens were of good quality and there was a down comforter. The room had the usual amenities (coffee maker, iron and ironing board, hair dryer) and the towels were thick. My only complaint is that the bathroom (the room that contains the toilet and bathtub--the sink was in an alcove outside the bathroom) was extremely tiny. I literally had to move my body sideways to get the door open from the inside or there would have been no room to open the door without smashing it in my face. We had a corner room, so perhaps the bathroom in those rooms is smaller. Also, there were no towel racks by the sink so we had to leave our hand towels on the counter. Otherwise we were happy with the room. When we received our bill under the door, we saw that we were charged $20 to receive two packages. These fees had not been disclosed, so we complained upon checkout and the front desk clerk removed the fee without an argument. Internet access is $15 per day from your room. The business center fees are steep, but you can print your airline boarding passes for free. Overall, the service was good. The concierge recommended an excellent (though expensive) seafood restaurant in the area called Farollan.

In contrast to the Westin St. Francis, not too many blocks away, the Westin SF Market Street feels like a smaller, boutique hotel (even though it is 36 floors high) emphasizing a more modern, cutting edge style. I enjoyed my stay immensely and will try to use this as my hotel of choice in San Francisco. ADVANTAGES: 1) Great location one block off of Market Street at the Kearny/3rd St and Market intersection. Union Square is an easy walk going North across Market St., and Moscone Center/SFMOMA one block in the other direction. BART is two blocks away, making access to the Westin easy to from SFO. 2) Spacious rooms (mine was 3603--top floor with a view looking South) with all the appropriate accessories including HD screen and fantastically comfortable Heavenly Bed. 3) Very well equipped 24 hour fitness center with five treadmills, three ellipticals, three cycles, and various weight equipment. All have built-in video monitors and headphones are provided. Fitness center is complimentary, which is a distinct difference from the Westin St. Francis where there is a fairly steep daily charge. 4) Excellent service--my HD display wasn't working the day I arrived, and a call to \"service express\" brought an engineer within 5 minutes. He tightened a connection and ran through with me how to navigate the screen menu. Very helpful and friendly! 5) DUCCA Restaurant in the hotel is fabulous! Cool, hip setting (e.g. clusters of whimsical and colorful Murano glass chandeliers) with a menu emphasizing seafood--and reasonably priced with entrees in the $20-25 range. Cocktails that must be double-sized: My Bombay Sapphire martini was enormous! DISADVANTAGES: 1) Bathroom is rather small (but the glass-enclosed shower is cool!),. 2) Wireless internet access (somewhat slow) is $15/day. 3) Minibar and items in the open all mounted on a sensing platform that automatically charges your account if you so much as pick up an item. I was afraid to even touch them! A notice gratuitously states that the automatic charge is for your convenience! (Sounds just like airline doublespeak).

The location is great for those planning on visiting the Union Square area, shopping on Market Street, and reaching Fisherman's Wharf within a ten-fifteen minute cab ride. China Town and North Beach are also a short commute away. However, the name of this hotel is misleading: the building (and entrance) is located on THIRD STREET less than half a block off of Market. On account of my mom's birthday we were upgraded to a thirty-second floor bay-view room which was very comfortable. The posh beds, plasma TV, and easy-to-use coffee maker with Starbucks coffee were all impressive, not to mention the view. Unfortunately the tub did not drain properly and one had to shower standing in two inches of water; so I do not rate this hotel as excellent. We tried the restaurant, Ducca, once for a breakfast buffet; at $22.50 per person I suggest either ordering a la carte or simply going elsewhere as the buffet is overpriced for the food selection (limited hot selection and fruit).

We'd asked for adjoining or connecting rooms, but were upgraded to a suite and adjoining king at the end of a hall. There was absolutely no noise from rooms next to or above us, and the only street noise was the fire trucks that ran down 3rd St. frequently. Our rooms were spotless (and trust me, as I check under beds and behind bathroom doors!) and well appointed. Having the living room was nice because we seemed to end up back at the hotel for an hour or so before dinner. We had a great view of the bay, AT&T Park, a bit of the Bay Bridge, and downtown. We could even watch the ice skating next to the Moscone Center at night! We only used the concierge for a few minor things--getting our boarding numbers for our flight, making dinner reservations once, and checking directions a few times. They did write out multi-stop directions for my husband and daughter. The young man who gave us directions our first night there was all attitude, but the two young women who worked Sunday were very friendly and knowledgeable. We had the buffet breakfast once, and thought it overpriced, but when we got double billed and called the front desk about it, they apologized and removed the charge completely, so for a free meal, it was excellent:) The location is great. We usually stay at Le Meridien in the Financial District, but being right off Market made it easy to get around using the buses and street cars. My only quibble with Westins in general is the extremely crappy bath amenities. I wouldn't use that shampoo on my dog!

The hotel had the audacity to charge me $15 for each small box or $45 to receive $30 in CD's! Absolutely criminal if you ask me. The concierge refused to reduce the charge to one $15 delivery fee which is bad enough. In addition, they charged me for $29 in minibar charges when I had exactly $0 worth of items. Worst, they charged me twice on the same day for Internet access and refused to deduct one of the two charges. The Heavenly Shower is not bad but an overengineered gimmick. They'd be better off with rainshower heads in my personal opinion. OVERALL The hotel is good looking and has a pretty good position in town.

There were a lot of people checking in so it took about 5-7 minute to check in but I find that normal for a busy hotel like this. It is better than having no guests and being empty in my opinion. It definately gives it a much more lively and upbeat feeling. The room was smaller than most of the hotels I've stayed at but very elegant. Simple decor yet stylish. The thing I look forward to the most is the Heavenly Bed and it was no exception. I always fall into a deep sleep. Overall I had no complaints. Express checkout was great cause of course, it was busy at the front desk. Consierage was very helpful and when I checked out I left my bags at the hotel for free in a room which was great.

The room was extremely clean, and the very white duvet felt especially so. The beds were very comfortable. I always want fitted sheets because I roll around a lot, and although these were not fitted, they were tucked in well enough to stay in place through the night. My beef was that there is a typical thermostat in the room but it seemed that it is set with a very narrow range that the guest can change. I am ALWAYS cold, yet I could not turn down the thermostat enough to feel comfortably cool. I can't imagine how a hot blooded person would feel. Finally I turned it down 60 and still felt hot. This was in a 7th floor room. I don't know whether they're all like that. Other things that some prospective guests might be interested in: The sink is inside the bathroom, so one person cannot be showering while another is outside the bathroom using the sink. The windows go all the way to the floor, which is very nice, but some parents with young kids might be wary. The plusses were a helpful staff, good location and as I said earlier, very, very clean.

We are Gold Starwood Preferred Guests and this hotel was not able to extend a late check-out nor was it able to upgrade our room category upon arrival. Although I understand that this hotel caters generally to business travelers, for leisure travelers, I would not pay more than $200 for a Standard Room, even during peak-times in San Francisco. We booked this room initially for over $300 per night but two days before arrival the rate lowered to $199, as went as low as $159 several hours before check-in. For business travelers that will have their expenses reimbursed, then I guess it would not matter what rate you are paying. When calling the hotel directly, it takes the hotel operator sometimes in excess of 10 rings to answer a call. I am not sure if this hotel offers its guests' Concierge services but I would be sure to inquire about it before making plans to stay here if you are going to require the assistance of a Concierge. We made no use of the fitness/spa or restaurant faculties so I will not comment on those aspects of the hotel. For your information, valet parking at this hotel is $42 per night plus taxes. Hotel accommodation taxes is 14%. You can park your car across the street in a public parking garage or turn into the Four Seasons alley way and find the Jesse public parking garage where you will pay $20 max/ per day. Be advised that the Jesse parking garage closes at 10 or 11 and DOES NOT open until the next morning. Your car WILL BE stuck until the next morning so if you will be needing your car throughout the night, do not park here. Check-in at this hotel is consistent with any other convention hotel. It was busy and the check-in staff did not honor their priority check-in line for Gold/Platinum Starwood Guest members. The Standard Room we were given was on the lower floors of this 36 floor hotel and our view was of another rooftop's A/C unit. We were looking down the alley way of the Four Seasons where their guests bring their cars to valet park. It was really a small room. Generally I prefer to stay at hotels where rooms start out at 400-500 sq ft in the Standard Room category but this hotel's standard guest room was half that size. There was a king bed, a desk/chair, a dresser with a flat screen television, and a bath with shower/tub combination. It was not very well ventilated, even with the air conditioning set at 65 degrees throughout the entire during of the stay. The toiletries are of the Westin brand variety (not really good) and all the sheets and towels are available for sale and made exclusively for the Westin hotel chain. If you are a tall individual you may feel that your head may hit the ceilings as they are set really low. We left the DND sign on our door and housekeeping honored the sign so I can't comment on that aspect of the hotel's service. You have an option of whether you want your sheets changed daily or left alone for the entire duration of your stay. We did order room service: three drinks, an entree and one order of an appetizer came up to around $80 dollars. A significant portion of our bill went to taxes, fees, and gratuities. The food was average but it did come up in half an hour. The bell-desk is ALWAYS busy. The valet brought up our car in less than five minutes. We were left waiting for a housekeeping attendant to bring down something we left in our room, granted it was our fault, but it took 10-15 minutes from when we made the call for someone to be sent down. I thought it was an excessive amount of time but maybe it should be expected. Check-out, like check-in took a fair amount of time of waiting as well even though there were 3 front desk agents and 3 guests in front of us. We waited probably 10-15 minutes to check-out. Again, they did not honor their priority check-in/out line for Gold/Platinum guests. The bill they sent up to our room before check-out was correct so there was no need to dispute anything about the bill. The location is excellent and I it would be a fair assessment to say that this hotel is able to get the job done when all you need is a clean and comfortable place to stay while in San Francisco; however, if you want a more personable hotel, this is not the place to stay. And like I mentioned above, for leisure travelers do NOT pay more than $200 for a Standard Room, I assure you unless you are upgraded to a better room, you will regret it as the price is not consistent with the value that you may expect. I know I would have been mad had I paid $300 for this room.", "Date": "October 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cNice base for SF activities\u201d", "Author": "flyer07", "ReviewID": "UR10075399", "Content": "Stayed at the Westin market street for two days in SF before a friend's wedding.

Of course, this is San Francisco and there are great food options very close so keep that in mind in picking your rate. The gym was nice and expansive for a hotel gym.

I decided to go for the suite and wish I hadn't spent the extra money. Modern decor is not my style. The rooms are oddly shaped, and the decor is, well, bland. Two chairs, a short, shallow sofa, huge wooden coffee table, work desk and chair, and a dresser with TV make up in the living room. The bedroom had a king size bed, a chair, another dresser with a TV on it. Both the living area and bedroom had flat screen TVs. The closet in the bedroom is miniscule and the closet in the living area was locked. No clock in the living area, only on the clock radio in the bedroom. My 16th floor suite had nice floor to ceiling windows on two sides, but looked over numerous ugly rooftops. The bed wasn't as soft as I remember, and that was my reason for choosing the hotel. There is a beautiful work desk in the living area though, lots of plugs if you are a business person with many electronics! I brought my laptop and the WiFi worked great (extra charge, of course!) There is a mini bar with sodas and drinks in the corner of the living area. Coffee maker with coffee and a CD player. My room wasn't ready when I first arrived, so I left my bags and went out for awhile (the lobby is, indeed, very dark). When I returned, I found out the restaurant didn't open until 5:30 for dinner. I had been walking for a couple of hours and was very hungry by about 4:30. The nice doorman pointed me towards Thirsty Bear, a Spanish restaurant just a block or so away. Delicious food there. I loved the showers at the Westin. They have two shower heads. Since I travel solo...always plenty of towels! The bathroom was fine with soap, shampoo, conditioner, makeup mirror, hairdryer. Nice marble counter and floor, which makes for a cold floor...but...did you know standing on a cold floor in bare feet, if you have a leg cramp makes it feel better? That is a helpful tip when you are walking up and down hills in San Francisco! Another reviewer said that you had to weave your way through numerous cars that are parked in front of the Westin's entrance. Correct. Later in the evening, when I came back from the theater about 10pm, I could barely get from the sidewalk to the door, there were so many cars. However, I did find the front desk, room service, and everyone who assisted me in person or on the phone to be very polite and helpful. A late checkout was graciously handled for me. They have WiFi (charge) and in room movies (you'll pay more for one than if you went to the theater yourself). I had room service twice, both for a late snack and breakfast. The food was fine and the service was friendly. The hotel is nice enough, I found it quiet except for sirens from the street at all hours. Close to everything and the room was exceptionally clean. All things being equal, I think if I came back, I'd try another hotel. Nothing against the Westin, really.

We were ignored both visits by several cocktail waiters and after 10 minutes had to go up to the bartender to get a drink which took another 10 minutes. One drink and we left. The second time we were again ignored so we never made an attempt to enter the bar or eat at the restaurant in the hotel, assuming it was the same type of staff.

Well, on our second night after dinner, we decided to do that. We got all ready with our snacks and cocktails we purchased from the local store and nothing.

Check In was noticeably fast, and my 4pm check out was honoured without a problem; the maid even refreshed my room on my last morning which helped make packing a tidier affair for me. Bathrooms were small, but that seems to be the norm in all SF hotels. The location cannot be beaten; four minutes walk from the South Side of Union Square and just round the corner from the Four Seasons and opposite the Fantastic San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, with the new and unmissable Olafur Eliasson light show. Wired web connection was easy to access, swift and affordable ($15.99) though if you just need to check emails, pop over Market Street to the Apple store where you can get online for a few minutes free. Two tips; if you are renting a car, get a Hybrid (Prius) as they charge half price ($22/night) for these environmentally friendly cars vs. $42 for a regular vehicle. Second: if you go to Macy's take your room key and out of state ID to Customer Services for an 11% discount.

A couple of times we asked for Westin Market Street but they still drove us to St Francis The location is very very good. A short walk from Union Sq and BART, MUNI, bus stops are only minutes away. Right in the middle of shops as well as the Westfield shopping arcade just ten minute away. Office Depot is right opposite and there is a Starbuck just round the corner. Reception has a nice ambience and scent and hotel generally nicely decorated. Quite clean except I noticed a bit of wrapping left lying on a slightly dusty table in the elevator lobby throughout my 4-night stay. Check-in staff was efficient but did sense a cold tone when she mentioned Priceline. Hotel has a well equiped fitness room but small and a bit cramped. Strange thing is that there didn't seem to be a restaurant within the hotel, I could be wrong though. Conciege was very helpful when we tried to arrange transport to the airport. Valet parking was $40 plus + tax (ouch) but only used them for one night as rental car was to be returned the next day. I couldn't be bothered looking for a cheaper parking for that reason but did notice cheaper garages close by. Unless absolutely necessary, I would avoid driving in SF - a lot of roads are one-way.. Beside, public transport is the way to go to get around - cheap and easy to use and many options - just get a muni/bart pass. Front of hotel could get a bit chaotic as 1) small and 2) cars waiting to be parked are left everywhere, even onto the pavement. As the hotel was completely full, we couldn't get a king bed so settled with two queens. I stayed on 26/F so noise wasn't a problem but being on a very busy road, I can imagine lower floors can experience some noise from the traffic. My room was 2616 and I noticed all the other rooms are 'Starwood Preferred Guest' rooms (say so on the doors). Maybe that's why the room was relatively more spacious. Again simply and nicely decorated and clean. Room overlooking main roads. Being on a high floor, I was glad to see the tops of most surrounding buildings.. Bathroom was reasonably sized with towels and toiletteries refilled/replaced daily. Shower wasn't that powerful though. Small wardrobe with a safe and just big enough for our two cases.

The staff seemed overwhelmed during check-in - which was about 6:30 PM on a Friday night. We had 4 bags (2 large and 2 carry-ons) and were at no time offered assistance or bellmen. When we asked about it - we were told that the wait was 35 to 40 minutes so we took our own bags up to the room. The room itself was fine. We were on the 26th floor and had a nice view of the city. The Westin is one hotel that charges a premium for internet service and it is not wireless- making it less than desirable for someone trying to transact business while staying there. In fact, we had to connect two separate times at a double price of $14.95/day. They still have not credited the first bill although they told us that they would take care of it. The hotel --although refurbished is showing signs of wear and tear. The carpet was frayed and bald in areas- and the furniture marred and chipped. There were several large groups staying at the hotel. On Saturday night- one of the took over the entire lobby area, monopolized the elevators and the lobby absolutely reeked of marijuana. No one at the hotel seemed to care or take any steps to do anything about it. There was a large pool of vomit in one of the elevators that was left there for at least an hour because my husband encountered it a second time when he went down to the lobby to print boarding passes. Speaking of boarding passes- one of the consierges tried to charge my husband $20 to print two boarding passes (something that EVERY hotel does as a courtesy) and sent him to an Instant Print place around the corner because they charged less. Another consierge heard him and agreed to do it for no charge. My husband was wondering just how many people agreed to pay the exorbitant charge just to do this simple task. Checking out- once again - no bell men. They also did not take my Priority Club card stating that they had no record of it when I had the card in hand. All-in-all, although the hotel was a bargain and the room adequate, the treatment from the staff was nothing short of rude and the other guests in the hotel (drunk, obnoxious, and out of control) made the visit less than enjoyable. At a minimum, when I go to a hotel that is rated a 4 star, I would expect good service at check in and check out and a safe., clean environment in common areas.

If you're interested in such things, Starbucks is directly across the street to the left. The rooms were clean and comfortable and had, of course, been given the full \"Westin treatment\" with the heavenly bed, typical desk, and so forth.

The new northern Italian restaurant off the lobby is good, but with so many other options in the city, I would look further afield. At least during our stay, they did not yet serve brunch.

The minibar fridge was one of the new ones without any space for your own items and the \"you move it, you pay\" setup. Material in the room, though, said that the property had a limited number of mini-fridges available free of charge, if needed. When we asked for one, it was delivered and set up in minutes.

After a full 25 minutes of waiting, someone finally showed up, but not surprisingly, they gave us horrible service.

Not huge deal since they comped the room AND the parking for one of the cars for TWO days ($85). Frustrating but nice way of making up for the error in my opinion. Staff is moderately friendly. One porter watched me lug my own bags out of the elevator and kind of laughed when he saw I was struggling a bit. He at least got the door for me, but not the kind of service I would expect from this caliber of a hotel. Overall the room was good. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was adequate.

Suddenly, a smoking room became available. As this was also unacceptable, we asked that they at least waive the high $42 parking fee if we had to wait, since we technically had paid for the room since 3pm. When we asked for the manager, a non-smoking room miraculously became available. No apology or explanation. Needless to say, we were not happy with the service, even if we eventually got a decent room with some serious prodding. On the plus side, the daytime front desk staff, housekeeping, and valet were very nice. The night desk clerk and manager seemed to needed some training in customer service.

I'm overly sensitive to decor and cleanliness. That said, let's begin... 1. Bring your printed confirmation with rate noted. I read a review about a rate check-in issue by another traveler on Tripadvisor. I always bring a printout, but I wasn't going to take any chances with The Argent. Upon arrival I was given the room rate of $336 for a one night stay. My confirmation (which I printed from their website) noted $189. They handled the issue in a professional manner. 2. Room: Clean and cozy. The glass on the work station needed to be wiped down. The furniture and bedding were upscale in appearance. The TV was freakishly small. It must have been an 18\u201d TV. I have a 52\u201d at home, so I felt like I was a teenager in my childhood bedroom. I reserved a Deluxe room with king bed. The passageway between the TV center and end of bed was about a foot and a half wide. I did say cozy\u2026 :) 3. Bed: The mattress was hard. It needed a featherbed as you could feel the springs thru the padding. The sheets were standard, say 210 thread count. The pillows were down \u2013 big bonus. If I had to rate on a scale of 1-10, the bed was a 6. A simple featherbed liner and higher thread count sheets would make a huge difference. 4. Bathroom: Nothing special. Standard tub. The water took about 10 minutes to go from cold to hot. 5. Hallway noise: The ice machine was located across the hall. Every hour or so, the ice machine would dispense a load of ice, which made a crashing sound. I woke up a few times during the night due to the noise. Try avoiding rooms next to the ice machine. 6. Location: Great location! Shopping 1 block away. Starbucks directly across the street. Liquor and munchies store nearly connected to the hotel. 24 hour 7-11 around the corner. Seriously, the location was the best. 7. Workout room: Nothing special. 3 treadmills, a few ellipticals, a recumbent bike, some weight machines. I would say this hotel is more like a 3.5 star hotel. I wasn\u2019t impressed, but I wasn\u2019t disappointed. For under $200 bucks \u2013 it was pleasant enough for me. Would I go there again? Nope, but only because I like to try out other hotels.

Upon arrival, people at the reception were friendly, and check-in went very quickly. We received one of the corner rooms, away from the elevators, with floor to ceiling windows. There were some small details that didn't make the room look fabulous (thorn curtains, burn stains on sheets, thorn carpet,...) but overall it looked nice so I didn't complain about it. The bed was very good and the bathroom was clean. On the first morning we opened only one pair of curtains and left the other pair closed. When we arrived back in the room (after housekeeping went through it) the curtains were exactly as we left them, and it stayed like this for the 7 days we spent there. On the third day I moved the chair standing in the corner to the middle of the room (just to see whether they would put it back), and again nothing happened. But all this is nothing compared to our last evening there: When we were packing, I found a pair of underpants on the floor in the walk-in closet (carpeted, so normally a place that should at least be vacuum-cleaned) which didn't belong to my boyfriend or me! I was completely stunned, and I called the front desk to complain about this. The answer of the receptionist to my remark that I had a complaint about house-keeping was: \"Oh no.\" She transferred the call to house-keeping, I explained the problem (I heard her laughing on the phone, very professional), and the only thing she said was: \"Do you think they have been lying there all week?

When i explained that we just flew in and needed to go right away to a conference session at Moscone, we had no problems checking in earlier than the normal check-in time. For \"discount\" Internet hotel reservations customers ---------------------------------------------------- After winning the bid for $125 per night at Priceline, i read numerous travelers' reviews of Argent. Since it seemed that, even with a discount, we might still be able to a nice room at a higher floor (which according to other reviews should be somewhere above 12th to 15th). We then took an early flight (from NY to SF) to avoid a late arrival, late check-in, and an unsatisfactory room assignment. A very nice, soft-spoken lady named Kathy greeted me at the registration front desk. While she was looking my name up, i asked her if it was possible for my husband and i to get something at a floor higher up. She asked whether we preferred a King or two Doubles, i picked a King, and without any problems she put us on the 15th floor! So my suggestion is, try your best to avoid late check-ins. Size of the room ---------------- Some travelers were saying that, when they lie in bed, they could literally reach the television with their toes :-) So we were anxious to find out what our room looked like. When we opened the door with the card, we were both WOWing! It was a corner room, and it was NOT small at all!! The first thing that caught my attention was the floor-to-ceiling glass window (as advertised on Argenthotel), and the view, while not looking at neither Bay Bridge nor Golden Bridge, was quite amazing as well. There were some highrise buildings a few blocks away (in most directions), and i am pretty sure higher floors could get better views of maybe the bridges, but overall the 15th floor is already not blocked by adajacent or across-the-street buildings. For the room itself and its layout, please see the pictures attached. (But i thought the pictures still do not show that the size of the room is great.) From my limited sense of direction in a city where i had never been, Room 1524 is very likely facing northeast. Also, through opened doors, i could see that other rooms on 15th floor are more like square layouts. They (e.g., Rm 1507) seem to be larger than the corner room(s), and they seem to have double beds. Internet access --------------- Some previous reviews were complaining that Argent charged $13 or so per day for Internet access. Interesting enough, a friend of mine who was staying at a nearby hotel told us that she was able to pick up some signals from the street, and we did! In Rm 1524 for instance, the signal was on and off in bed, yet remained rather stable on the desk by the window. The concierge ------------- The concierge at Argent now provides complimentary boarding pass printing (or e check-in). i did not know about this until i made a phone call to the front desk inquiring whether there was any charged document-printing service. What is lacking --------------- A swimming pool, since Argent is said to have a 4-star rating! And, one funny thing is, the hotel does not provide shower caps. They probably a hairdryer will do after people wash their faces :-) Transportations --------------- i believe most people do their homework before going to San Francisco Bay area, yet i still highly recommend paying $11 at the ticket station (Powell @ Market Street) for the one-day pass, which allows traveling on buses and cable cars.

We were really questioning why we decided to try something else from the moment we walked in the door. Nobody offered to help us with our bags which seemed odd but whatever. We then made our way over to the check-in counter. There were two people in front of that were waiting in line. They did not appear to be together and both looked quite puzzled. After waiting 10 minutes with nobody at the front counter to help us, I fear that we had the same puzzled looks on our faces. I finally asked them how long they had been waiting... 1 said about 10 more minutes than we had and the other simply said too long. My boyfriend then took a tour of the rather small lobby area to see if anyone was working that evening after no offer on the bags and a empty counter at check in. He found someone who must have made a call because only then did someone come out of the little office adjacent to the check in counter. He looked as if we had woke him up from a nap. We finally were helped after a 30 minute wait and the gentleman that checked us in was quite nice but still looked a little groggy. On to the room! We thought... THIS HAS TO GET BETTER. Well, not so much it turns out. The room was very small and very outdated. We were in 3224 which did offer a decent view but that is the only plus to this room. I completely agree with the other reviewer that said it was possible to change the channel with your toes from bed as it was that small. It is worth noting that we were in what was considered to be an \"upgrade\" room which is the deluxe. They have three categories standard, superior, and deluxe before getting into the suite category. So the deluxe was the best of the standard so to speak. I would have hated to see the other rooms. In closing, the only pleasant experience we had was with the doorman on our way out on the town two times. He was very nice. Who knows where he was the night we came in.

If we visted San Fransisco again, we would not stay at The Argent, but would check into the Westin St Francis which is in a better location (overlooking Union Square) and has much more character.", "Date": "July 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "orlando, fl", "Title": "\u201cnot worth the price\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3618798", "Content": "We stayed at the Argent hotel from the 22nd June 05 for 4 nights. We had requested a king bed high floor room, and had spoken to the reservations dept on two separate occasions regarding the request. We had the displeasure of being checked in by an extremly hostile lady who proceeded to advise us that the company that we had booked our rooms with only had rooms from the 1st-7th floor as they paid a discounted rate. Since i work for that particular company, I was appalled that she would tell myself and other customers this. She did not offer any infomation about the hotel and im convinced she gave us one of the worst rooms. The room we had on the 5th floor overlooked a moss covered roof and the car park, it was depressing to say the least but after a long journey and busy schedule we stayed put. Aside from the view, the carpet was dirty, the bath stained and had mildew and long black hairs in it. The carpets in the corridor were filthy. The next day i asked if their was any other rooms available and was offered a 9th floor next to the elevators, which i refused. At that point i decided to unpack and not worry. The staff were mostly snobbish and rude, like working for the Argent gave them some kind of status that was above yours. The prices were outrageous and the concierge staff distracted and lukewarm. The location wasnt bad, but since the main reason we booked the hotel was because of its floor to ceiling windows offering a great view, without the view and with the poor attitude of the staff, its really not worth the extra money.", "Date": "June 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hickory, NC", "Title": "\u201cAm I a snob?\u201d", "Author": "VLBerry", "ReviewID": "UR3483636", "Content": "I stayed at the Argent Hotel for a business trip the weekend May 15-17. It was one block from the Moscone convention center and near many great restaurants. Until I read some of these reviews I did not know that this was considered an upscale 4-5 star hotel. I had seen pictures on the website and thought it looked like it was going to be great. It was obvious the hotel had been remolded and updated with modern furntiure and decorations. However when I arrived in my room, the furniture and decorations, while modern were in bad condition. There were beautiful mustard colored high back chairs to sit in but there was a noticeable dark area where most people would rest their heads. The carpets were dirty, the armoire doors were broken, and there were marks left from suitcases and who knows what else all over the walls. Some simple touch up paint could leave a much better impression. The bathroom was worse, the tub stained brown, the shower curtain was old and stained. On a good note, the service was good, concierge was helpful and the location was great. The price is decent too for San Francisco. The view from my room was also spectacular. If you are looking for a luxury experience I would go to the Ritz Carlton or the Four Seasons (a block from the hotel).

Pleased by the courtesey of both hotel & valet staff. Somewhat disappointed in the cleanliness of our room, carpet could definately have been more thouroughly vaccumed. Had booked an Asian Art Museum package & upgraded from \"Superior\" to \"Deluxe King\", the difference between the two is 1. A king size bed as opposed to two double beds, 2. We got a room \"with a view\" looking over the Yerba Buena Gardens & the Metreon complex. I was glad that I had booked the room on a higher floor, because of the layout of the City, as there is little to see from the lower floors. Room service was prompt & friendly, but a little pricey, even for those of us with 4 & 5 star taste!! Received a good deal by purchasing the Asian Art Museum package, room alone would have normally cost $300-$500, but we spent less than $300 on the room, valet parking, museum admission, dinner out & room service for breakfast. By the way, & slightly off subject, the Asian Art museum is beautiful, & most definitely recommended to visitors to San Francisco, or anyone with an intrest in Eastern history & culture.", "Date": "April 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cnot luxury at all\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3324675", "Content": "My first trip to San Francisco was great, minus the hotel room.

When we got to the room. the view was spectacular, but the room wasn't at all 'deluxe'. There were chips of wood taken out of the light fixtures, the TV was tiny with horrible reception on most channels, bathroom only had one tiny bar of soap (for both the sink AND the tub), the bathtub was difficult to get in and out of if you're under 5'4\"....etc. None of which I would deem 'luxury accomidations'. Btw, we never did request the room we had origionally booked. There was a Mexican Soccer Team in for the weekend, and we were afraid of being put in a room either on a rowdy floor, or beside the ice making machine. The view was the deciding factor.
