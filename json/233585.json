We reserved a room on the 5th floor with a balcony that had an amazing view of the Tower. We arrived at 6:30 am and the room was not yet available, but the hotel staff was very helpful and offered to hold our luggage while we proceeded to our first tour we had booked that morning and gave us a map and explained the easiest way to get to the meeting point. The staff were always very happy and helpful, never made us feel like \"stupid american tourists.\" The room was small, but very nice and clean. The bed was VERY comfortable! There is a mini fridge filled with items to purchase, and a mini-safe to hold your valuables. There is free wi-fi in the room (remember to ask for a few wi-fi password slips as each password can be used once, so if your computer/smartphone disconnects and doesn't remember the password, you will need to enter a new password, but just ask for a handfull of wi-fi slips and the staff will be happy to give them to you). The best part is the view. Open the window and step out to the balcony and look to the right, and right there is an excellent view of Paris's most beatufil monument - the Eiffel Tower. My wife and I bought a bottle of wine and sat out on the balcony a few nights before going to sleep and enjoyed the wine and the view as the tower sparkled every hour at night. The location is excellent, only 5 minute walk to the Champs de Mars (the park in front of the Eiffel tower), a 5 minute walk from the Hotel Invalides museum, and 2 blocks from the nearest metro stop. The metro in Paris is a little confusing and overwhelming at first for those that don't live or frequent big cities, but the staff is very helpful in explanining how to get to specific areas using it. Many cafes and restaurants are within walking distance as well. Breakfast was included with our room (I think we paid extra for it, but the breakfasts were ok and the same everyday - eggs, bacon, juices, fruit, and some french pastries. The breakfast wasn't gormet or anything, but great as a quick bite before heading out to tour the city. The breakfast staff didn't speak a lot of english, but they were very nice and helpful and tried very hard to make sure you got what you needed. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a beautiful experience while traveling to Paris.

Our room was small which is, we understand, par for the course in Paris and you just need to accept that. It might be worth considering an upgrade to one of the bigger rooms so that you get that Eiffel Tower view. The bathroom was also very compact but functional. Really nice area with Metro stops and good local shopping include the Rue Cler which has examples of every type of stereotypical French shop you can imagine - great for remembering your Higher Grade French!Lots of nice places to eat - special mention the for 7eme Vin bistro. Whenever you have message they write it on a tiny blackboard next to the lift! They acted on our behalf when we experienced big problems with the bus tour company - see our review of that - and got our money back for us. Free internet in the lobby via their Apple Mac.

The hotel is about a 10 minute stroll from the Eiffel tower, and 15 minutes from Montparnasse. The nearest metro station was only 3-4 mins away (ecole militaire) which is on line eight and seems to be very central, we only used the metro and found it very quick and easy. We had a superior room on the fifth floor (room 54) which was lovely, the level of cleanliness was excellent, the staff were all very friendly and extremely knowledgable about the area, and we certainly picked their brains enough! They gave us advise on the metro, opening times of places, restaurant recommendations (very good restaurants) and even put a half bottle of champagne and a card saying 'happy anniversary' in the room as we told them it was our anniversary, which was a lovely surprise when we got to our room. You can also book a shuttle from Charles de gaulle airport to the hotel via the hotel by emailing them your flight details, which was 36\u20ac for two, but got cheaper the more people there are. We found this very convienient as it is only about 25 mins from the hotel and much better then getting the trains. The view from our balcony was fantastic, we had the eiffel tower one way, and montparnasse in the other, it is on a main road which seems to be quite on the weekend but busy during the week, however this was not a problem as the double glazing was very good. The mini bar is very reasonably priced, and although there are no tea or coffee making facilities you can request it from reception (there is no room service as it is a little boutique so you do have to go and ask) however we didn't feel that this was a problem. The shower was really nice and powerful which is unusual but very welcome, although larger people may find there is not much space in the shower. Breakfast was really good, a very French selection of bacon and eggs, crossiants, pain au chocalat and bread with a selection of preserves and yogurts. Breakfast is self service but tea and coffee are sever by the pleasant breakfast staff, in a lovely cellar which is bright but cosy. We had no complaints with the hotel and are already planning to go back to Paris (which we loved) and when we do we will definately stay at the Duquesene Eiffel, and would urge everyone to do the same!", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Amy G", "ReviewID": "UR126189712", "Content": "Everyone at the hotel was incredibly helpful - from booking a room with a view via email months prior to our trip, reserving a shuttle from the airport, calling a cab for us and even providing stamps to mail last minute postcards.

Having never been to Paris before and spending many many weeks trawling the internet for a hotel with a view - this did not disappoint. We decided to get a room on the 5th floor with a balcony and view of the Eiffel Tower and paid extra for this. Also we booked direct with the hotel to assure we would get the room we desired. We had paid more than if we booked elsewhere but we had the confirmation of the room number and a cancellation up to the day before so we felt this was worth it. We were greeted by a very very helpful and polite receptionist who spoke very good English and always smiled which made us feel very welcome. We stepped out onto our balcony and WOW is all I can say the Eiffel tower was in view and was fantastic at night also when it has a light show on the hour. We both felt we could not have picked a better hotel for the view was amazing and we knew we were definitely in Paris. The room was very clean and neat and comfortable ok not the biggest but we knew that this is typical of most hotel rooms in Paris and as I keep saying the view was really all we could rave about. We chose not to eat breakfast there as we were out all day every day. The metro is just a few minutes down the road. Also we used the Batobus to get on and off the tourist attractions which we found excellent value for money, just past the Eiffel Tower about 15 minutes walk away from the hotel.

I booked the hotel direct via email and asks them for a room with a view as this would be our first visit to Paris and a surprise birthday present for the missus, so as romantic as possible. A week before arrival I received an email saying scaffolding would be up and could potentially spoil the view. I am glad they sent this as if I had arrived without forewarning I would be very disappointed. We found the hotel easily enough from metro station about 5 minutes walk away and were happy to see the scaffolding not up against the building but dismantled infront of the building ready for removal. We had arrived 4 hours before check in so were not expecting our room to be ready. I had emailed them to say we would be early and asked if we could store our luggage while we explored the city. To our delight the room was ready so, after our friendly hotelier assured us that if we needed any advise, or information we needn't hesitate to ask, we took THE ELEVATOR up the our room, (number 45). I can't tell you how happy the number 45 made me after reading TripAdvisor reviews I knew this was a good room. And we weren't let down. Clean, more than enough room, the most comfortable bed (haven't slept so well in a long time) and the view! It was perfect. It might be worth adding that during our stay I needed some advise on where to eat and was very happy with where we found ourselves having taken the advise given. All in all a very enjoyable stay, friendly staff, beautiful room and would definitely recommend to anyone who cares to hear it. Also breakfast was nice and not too expensive like some hotels.

Upon arrival we we're greeted with scaffolding across the outside of the building which was a little surprising however to quote another reviewer ... at least the building is been maintained. We were provided with a complimentary bottle of champagne on the final night which was a nice gesture. Additionally, one final negative was that the lift was out of action due to the work been undertaken however we were provided with a free breakfast for the duration of our visit which was great. The food was tasty with a good selection to choose from. We found all the staff a great help. The girls on the front were friendly and helpful. The maids did a good job and were friendly. The workmen in the building were respectful & considerate of guests. The room was great - rooms in Paris are small but this was spacious enough for 2 messy people with bags without it feeling cramped. The only minor issue for me was that the beds were 2 singles pushed together and not a standalone double. The view from our room on the 5th floor was great despite the scaffolding. The beds were comfortable. There was a good selection of reasonably priced drinks in the mini-bar. The free wireless was fast and worked well - no issues at all. Overall the hotel was clean and everything aside from the lift was in working order. There was plenty of hot water available. The shower was powerful. If I was to visit Paris again I certainly would stay here and would definitely recommend this hotel to friends & family.

We asked the hotel in advance for a room with a view and were lucky enough to be allocated room 45, which was completely out of this world!!! The view of the Eiffel Tower was magical. I would recommend anyone to upgrade and give enough time to request a great view. Although there was scaffolding erected on the property at the time of our stay this did not inpose on our view one bit, so I can't understand the negative posts. The superior rooms are very spacious and the beds are very comfortable. We definitely benefited from the triple glazed windows as the room was very quiet. The hotel is situated in a great area and very close to some great bars, cafes & patiserries - great for an early morning croissant. We were recommended an evening meal at 7 Vin (ask the hotel staff where to find this) which served the most amazing food. Get there before 8pm though as the restaurant is very small and fills up very quickly. We also visited Central Cafe on Rue Cler which we loved as the bar has a happy hour and again serves great food. I would HIGHLY recommend the shuttle bus the hotel offers to & from the airport, however after a certain time this isn't available. I believe the last trip is around 7pm. The taxi from the airport to the hotel cost us \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60 so the hotel shuttle at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac36 for two people for one way is a bargin!!!

This was a suprise birthday present for her and when I was researching I wanted to find a good quality hotel close to the Eiffel Tower / Central Paris that was a decent price. BINGO. I did some searching round trip advisor and this directed me to the Hotel Duquense. A previous user had recommended Rooms 45 or 55 and if anyone wants a romantic view to add to their Hotel expereince, make contact with the hotel and ask for one of these rooms. The view of the tower is amazing. We sat in our room looking out the big windows at the sparkling Eiffel Tower literally outside the window. I asked for either room and we ended up with room 45, I think 55 might be even better! We arrived at Gare du Nord and after a short wait for a taxi outside we got a cab to the Hotel. Only a 10-15 min trip and about 18 euros should sort it. Be aware taxi's charge extra for bags so that 18 euros is a total of everything. The hotel staff were fluent in english and were really helpful for suggesting places to eat and where to head. We were only in Paris for a long weekend and may I recommend the bus tours round the city. An awesome way to see all the city and get some info about everything you see. We picked the bus up from the bottom of the Eiffel Tower (should prob say this is only a 5-10 min walk from the Hotel). You can see the tower from the hotel and its a very easy walk to navigate. The busses go round all the expected landmarks and you can get off and back on at your leisure. Also the boat trips down the Seine are great, not overly expensive but a lovely afternoon trip. We decided to go back to the boats for an evening dinner cruise, which was lovely for a romantic trip for 2. There were lots of larger tables but the food and service was great for everyone. This trip was a little expensive but well worth it if anyone wants to take their other half on a romantic dinner trip. Overall the hotel was perfect. Great staff, ideal location, clean, and friendly.

I chose the hotel as it was reasonably priced and definitely the nicest looking and best location out of my short list. After a short trip on the metro the hotel was a few minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 walk from the station and easy to find. The receptionist was very friendly and check in no problem. Our friend was given a standard room with a double bed plus single and separate bathroom and toilet. We thought our room was going to be directly above his and so we were expecting the same but we had booked a deluxe room and so had a lovely surprise when we entered the room to see it was completely different layout, a little more spacious and with a balcony. Stepping out on the balcony and seeing the Eiffel Tower was unforgettable- it was unexpected and we were pretty amazed, despite having visited Paris and seen the tower a few times before. Our room was numbered but was also called Arc de Triomphe and was on the 5th floor. We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the hotel for long enough to really appreciate everything but the rooms were a good size, lovely furnishings and a very comfortable bed. Bathroom was nice with a lovely rose body lotion amongst the toiletries. The reception area was contemporary and the girls on reception were really very friendly, happy and helpful. I realised two days after checking out that I had left some boots in the wardrobe so gave the hotel a call and they had them (unfortunately there had been many items left that day and so they were unable to know exactly what was left in each room, so were very pleased and apologetic when we called up!). We drove to the hotel and the boots were there for me so I was pleased! The hotel is in a great location just 10 minutes walk from the Eiffel Tower and if like us you decide not to have breakfast in the hotel there is an amazing bakery just around the corner; we spent a small fortune in there then sat in the grounds of the tower to eat.

The lady he spoke to could not have been more accommodating, advising us that as they were fully booked she would not be able to give us a room with a view that day but would be happy to upgrade us free of charge the following day. This was all dealt with whilst we were out sightseeing and we arrived back to a most splendid view and lovely room. Granted the rooms are small but fully equipped with everything one would need, toiletries, hairdryer, air-con, desk and chair, bedside cabinets and lighting, mini bar, safe and a most comfortable bed and pillows. Shower pressure was good and the water nice and hot. Despite being on a fairly busy road with the windows closed you could not hear a thing so a deep sleep was had every night. The hotel's positioning was very good, a 5 minute walk to the nearest Metro station and a 10-15 minute walk to the Eiffel. Bars and restaurants just a stroll away.

On the plus side, the room was very clean and the bed was fairly comfortable. On the negative side, the room was extremely small, the bathroom was just okay; the towels were thin and felt like sandpaper, the small shower area had only a glass door that covered the front half of stall, and the hair dryer was low-functioning. It consisted of a device connected to the wall with a tube that blew a little air from the head, however, despite using it for some time, I was unable to get my hair dry. I think if the hotel added a few extra items, such as a room safe, a nicer hair dryer, nicer towels, a universal electrical outlet adapter, the hotel would be upgraded quite a bit. Yes, the rooms are small, but I could easily tolerate that if I had a few \"homely comforts.\" Additionally, I think it is very important for hotel staff to be accommodating and pleasant in their interactions with patrons. On our first day, we did not experience that. We called to ask for an additional wash cloth on the afternoon of our arrival, as there was only one in the room. The front desk girl seemed surprised by the request. Shortly thereafter, a washcloth was delivered to our room. The woman who delivered it seemed annoyed at being bothered in the afternoon, despite our repeated \"Merci/Thank you.\" When we left the hotel via the lobby a few minutes later, the same woman gave us a very unpleasant look (which I found disconcerting as I thought she would be cleaning our room during our stay). Fortunately, she was not. I must say that the young lady who DID clean our room was pleasant. She always greeted us with a friendly \"Bonjour\" and smile as we passed her in the hallway. She also did an outstanding job. I only wish that all staff had been as pleasant! The location was pretty good. About five blocks to the Eiffel Tower and about two blocks to Les Invalides (where Napolean's Tomb is found). Two blocks to the underground subway as well. Several cafes nearby, too. Though I requested a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower via our reservation several months prior, our room had a disappointing view of the alley way so to speak. The room is rated as a three-star, yet there are very few amenities provided and no porter to help with luggage. Additionally, the elevator barely holds one person with luggage at a time and the hallways leading to room are very narrow. Based on my experience, I would not stay here again.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Western Australia", "Title": "\u201cLovely, efficient boutique hotel with views of & close to the Eiffel Tower\u201d", "Author": "DJEargasm", "ReviewID": "UR116611179", "Content": "I pre-booked a deluxe room with views of the Eiffel Tower and was surprised at the low cost (in comparison to other accommodation in Paris), especially as it's short walk (15-25 minutes) to the Eiffel Tower. I was hoping that I wouldn't be disappointed by the comparatively low tariff - I CERTAINLY WASN'T!! Being a small, boutique style hotel it doesn't have a large front and huge signs, so it can be a little hard to spot initially. (We took a slow cruise down the avenue and spotted it reasonably easy.) I arrived into Paris on the early Eurostar train and was at the hotel by 9:45am - way too early for check in. However, the lovely and very friendly receptionist (Melanie, from memory) was very helpful in storing my luggage and looking after my laptop/DJ hardware gear whilst I joined family and visited the sites of Paris. She also offered directions downstairs to the bathroom so I could freshen up, which was a nice touch. Apart from the quality of the hotel, Melanie was a joy to be served by - so very friendly, helpful, multilingual and \"ooh-la-la\" very pretty - definitely an asset to the hotel. (Haven't felt so welcome in an accommodation premises in over a week - on the road for 40+ days.) Later on I returned to the hotel and officially checked in. This was a rather simple affair and was completed within a few minutes then off to my room via their small elevator. My room was situated on the top floor, overlooking Avenue Duquesne with a private balcony and views of the Eiffel Tower. Admittedly, the room was small and didn't allow for much free floor space, however it was sufficient and functional enough for me. It was all very clean and modern looking with reverse air-conditioning. It also consisted of a comfortable Queen bed with headboard with reading lights, two bedside tables, two wall mounted lamps, telephone, small wall mounted flatscreen TV, small desk with lamp and chair, footstool, bench seat and a wardrobe (with mini-bar, tea & coffee station, hanging spaces and a couple of shelves). The room was also tastefully decorated and thick, plush curtains covered both the glass French doors which lead to the balcony. At night the views of a lit up Eiffel Tower were splendid. The ensuite was also very small, but still practical and functional, and most importantly - very clean. It was all very bright and consisted of a toilet, towel rack, vanity sink and mirror, complimentary toiletries and shower gel, and a small shower-in-bath. The water pressure and temperature in the shower were both very good, with the only downfall being the slight lack of water containment allowing the toilet area to get moderately wet. A simple shower curtain would prevent this from occurring. The breakfast is a buffet style and costs extra. It is held downstairs (below reception) and the venue looked a bit small and cramped. However, I did not eat breakfast and only passed through the area to use the bathrooms - so there could've been more to it than what I witnessed. Unfortunately, I did not stay in Paris long enough to make the best of this hotel but what I experienced won me over, and if I ever return to Paris I would definitely stay here. Admittedly, the whole hotel from the reception and it's lobby (which has a very lovely sitting/waiting area complete with settees, chairs and coffee table) to the hallways, elevators and rooms are all quite small and compact, it all works very well. I really enjoyed my time at this hotel and I look forward to returning one day. Overall, if this falls into your budget (stretch it a little if you have to) then this is a really excellent and highly recommended boutique hotel to stay in whilst visiting Paris.

There was just enough room for 2 small night stands, a desk, dresser / closet and small flat screen TV on the wall (only CNN and BBC News English channels available so be sure to put some movies on your laptop or ipad). The bathroom was smallish and some of the larger Americans, like myself, might have trouble using the toilet and shower...but it's doable. The best part was that the Air Conditioner works very well which is a big plus for us Texans! My only gripe was the room safe is too small to hold my laptop and other expensive electronics. The all you can eat breakfast costs about 12 Euros each...which is reasonable if you were to buy the same breakfast at the grocery store 2 blocks away. They had basic cereals, milk, OJ, croissants and some pastries.

Apart from this glitch I would recommend this hotel, the location is perfect theres the metro close by even though we walked everywhere as it really doesn't take that long, theres plenty of restaurants and bakeries and also a supermarket just round the corner. Its just a shame that after spending months getting excited for this trip it was slightly dampened by the work going on!

After spending many, many hours searching through TripAdvisor, I selected Hotel Duquesne Eiffel based on the wonderful reviews, the lovely pictures, and the fact that they had a room with a (small, standing room only) balcony available. The staff was professional, kind, and helpful in our email correspondence prior to our arrival, and their friendliness did not diminish when we actually arrived. The ladies working reception during the day were happy to greet us with a smile and we did not feel embarrassed by our lack of French. The night clerk was very gracious about being woken up to check us out before 6am for an early flight. The hotel has an elevator which was small, but no smaller than most that we experienced in our European travels. The only mildly alarming thing was a sudden jerk as it slowed and stopped at its destination, but we put it down to a quirk of the elevator system and were happy not to have to climb six flights of stairs. The room itself, as one might expect from reading other reviews, was small - although I greatly amused my travel companion by exclaiming \"it's bigger than I thought it would be!\" It's not very well suited for people who need a lot of space or who have a lot of luggage, but no doubt the same could be said for most of the hotel rooms in Paris. The bathroom was not overly large, but the space was well-utilized and my only very minor) complaint would be that the high bathtub was a bit difficult to get in and out of. Both rooms were spotless and the maid service impeccable. We did not get the chance to try the hotel's breakfast, so cannot comment as to that. The free wi-fi was easy to use and worked perfectly, and I believe there was also a computer in the lobby available for guests who do not bring their own. Overall, we had a very nice stay at Hotel Duquesne Eiffel and the only reason we would not stay there again is that we found the 7th district too quiet for our taste, which is certainly no fault of the hotel.

Over the stay, the hotel was able to recommend places to go, explain to us how to get to places, book us transfers to the airport and attend to any other request we had. They even booked us dinner one night, which turned out to be great because even though reservations weren't required at this restaurant we were able to go ahead of a 45-60min wait for a table because we said we were staying at the Hotel Duquesne Eiffel. If like most people, you want a pleasant, comfortable hotel that is conveniently located and you know will leave you smiling and glad you stayed there, then I couldn't recommend this hotel any higher. You will love staying here and we will gladly return when we visit Paris again! A special thank you to the staff and management that made our trip to Paris such a memorable one!", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cAmazing view\u201d", "Author": "CEM80", "ReviewID": "UR94542670", "Content": "This hotel is situated near to most things, not far from a metro stop and a fabulous bakery.

We wanted to make sure our first experience was an unforgettable one so I researched extensively for a long time for a suitable hotel. I was very impressed with the reviews of the Hotel Duquesne Eiffel on tripadvisor. The location was exactly where we wanted to be, in a safe and friendly district, within walking distance of all the main attractions and the ultimate for me was to have a view of the Eiffel Tower from our room without paying a fortune, and to our absolute delight the hotel was exactly my dream come true and more! Thankyou tripadvisor for alerting me to this gem. We loved the fact that it was a small and intimate hotel which was another reason we were drawn to it. After an arduous delayed flight from Prague because of the snowy weather, from the minute we stepped into the lobby, we were treated with warmth and consideration. The hotel staff had organised the Airport Shuttle bus to pick us up and this was great and cheaper than a taxi. Helene confirmed that we had one of the top floor rooms, that I had been very careful to book early, with a cute little balcony(if you can possibly get one, do so) and on entering the room, we saw the absolutely stunning view of the Eiffel Tower. At night it sparkled and became even more beautiful! Yes, the room was quite small as expected from the reviews but we found it very adequate in size for our three night stay. It was well decorated and it and the tiny bathroom were spotlessly clean. The bed was very comfortable and cosy but who could sleep with that magic view out of the window! I was up all night taking photos! The next morning there was a dusting of snow over everything and we felt like we were in a fairy tale, coming from sunny Queensland where we never see this! We thought we would try the breakfast room the first morning and the ladies that took care of us here were delightful. The choice was limited but adequate and the selection on offer was delicious and you could eat as much as you liked. It is extra on top of the room rate, but we both felt it was good value. The cosy atmosphere and the great service brought us back again each morning of our stay. Not only Helene but all the front desk staff , including the managers Jennifer and Olivier(sorry if I've forgotten the names correctly) were so patient , considerate and helpful of two very inexperienced travellers, far from home, with very little French and I can't say enough about how they looked after us and put our minds at rest with information about things to do or how to get around. I only wish I had known that we could have booked some of our city tours through them. Keep this in mind if you would like to do this. We had booked a night tour from Australia which turned into a disaster and had returned unexpectadly very late/early morning from this tour and we were worried that because it was a small hotel, there would be no one up to let us in so we were very grateful to find the night watchman there to welcome us home! We were impressed and grateful! The lobby is a very welcoming, cosy, bright and happy area to relax or check emails(from memory, free) and it was here that we got to taste our first French Cognac! During our time in Europe, we experienced mainly five and four star hotels and I can honestly say that none were better than the Duquesne. It may not have had the size or the plushness of the bigger hotels, but we felt we got a six star experience and the hotel evokes such good memories of our trip, it became our favourite. I would never think of staying in any other hotel in Paris.

The decor is aesthetically pleasing and is certainly inoffensive, clean and the bed was very comfortable. I also cannot speak highly enough of the staff here. My pathetic french wasn't even worth attempting and all the staff were very fluent in English, had great senses of humour and always greeted us with a warm smile and 'how was your day?\" upon our return in the evenings. It felt like coming home to a warm haven after being out and about in the fresh chill of a Paris winters' day. They even shared their chocolates with us!

We absolutely adored this hotel. The decor is gorgeous, with rooms having been refurbished in a warm and charming style. The rooms are very clean and comfortable, and the location is extremely convenient (there is a metro stop about 2 mins from the hotel, which allows access to most places throughout Paris, and there are plenty of cafes and patisseries within walking distance). The staff were friendly and amazingly helpful. On numerous occasions they helped us try to find ways to deal with flights and trains being cancelled due to the extreme weather conditions at the time, and even allowed us to use their internet facilities to book travel arrangements after we had already checked out of the hotel. The man on the desk at night even came out with us during a snow storm to help us find a taxi, even though this meant he had to go back to work quite wet! We were always greeted with a friendly smile when returning to the hotel after a day of sightseeing, and staff were always happy to help us with things that language barriers would have otherwise prevented us from doing (such as making/confirming restaurant reservations). The first room we stayed in was very small, but still lovely and a great place to stay considering that we were not there to linger in the room, but to explore the city. The second room was booked well in advance and had a view of the Eifel Tower (room 35). This room was substatially larger, and was a wonderful place to stay in order to experience the romance of Paris. It was lovely viewing the Eifel Tower twinkling every night from the comfort of our room. We specifically requested this room at the time of booking, and I would recommend that you do this well in advance of your stay in order to secure a room with this view.

The room was small (think: larger cruise ship cabin), but that's ok. Unless you are planning on sharing one room for more than two people, the space in these rooms is perfectly fine. And after a long day of traveling, you might not even care about how big the room is so long as the bed is comfortable (which it was). The room was great and very clean. Exactly what I expect. The location of the hotel is fantastic. You are just a few blocks away from a Metro stop, Les Invalides, the Eiffel Tower and a bunch of cafes. Since this part of Paris is predominantly residential, there is a supermarket just around the corner which was a huge plus for us when we didn't feel like spending a lot for lunch some days. The neighborhood is pretty quiet at night, so if you like a nice evening walk without too much traffic this is the right part of Paris for it.

The hotel itself was appealing. It was located both slightly removed - yet near enough - to all the fun stuff we were hoping to do in Paris. Near the metro, that tower thing, the Seine, Rue Cler (for the RS crowd), plenty of cafes and bars... but a short two minute walk away from where the cafes started sprouting up, meaning the hotel itself was quiet. Best of both worlds. The interior was inviting as well, a smaller hotel that had a comfortable feeling to it (as opposed to a couple larger hotels we stayed at later, in which you were one of a herd of guests) ... Nice little sitting area, big iMac for guests, quaint little bar with a nice selection of scotch if you wanted one final night cap. Our room (20?) was small - partially based upon our American POV, and partially based upon our budget, as it seems more expensive rooms might have had more real estate - but it had a very comfy bed, and (just) enough space for our stuff. We were in Paris, so it's not like we spent any time more in our room than sleep and getting dressed/ready to go out required! The breakfast room was pretty cool looking, the spread was good enough when we needed a quick and convenient meal on a day with a tight schedule. However the extra effort of springing into action earlier our second (and more open) day in town and finding a nice cafe was worth it. And, finally, the staff. We found the staff very friendly and accommodating. They spoke English well and seemed genuinely interested in us and our adventures. They had no qualms in storing our backpacks our last day in town, after we had checked out, while we explored the city until it was time to head to the train station. Also, a nice, big gold star to the night clerk who did a wonderful job dealing with a frantic 2am Paris-time call from a non-French speaking American freaking out about a message from his booking service (hotels.com), 48 hours before departure, stating he might have lost his reservations...

The room was hot at night and the area was too noisy to sleep with the door to the balcony open. My biggest disappointment, however, was the affability of the staff. We asked to have the air conditioning checked but we didn't get any follow up and it didn't get fixed. There was no apology about the morning with no hot water (and no shower) and the evening guy with the shaved head seemed to have an attitude. When we checked out, we weren't asked about our stay.

But what makes this hotel extra special is the staff, Julie and Jessica speak English and do whatever they can to help you. I would gladly recommend this hotel. The 7th Arrondissement area was wonderful, 10 minute walk to Eiffel tower, close to the subway, supermarket, laundry. Beautiful walking spaces like the promenade of Avenue de Breteuil facing the dome of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel des Invalides. An area where you can see the French people walk their dogs, play their ball game P\u00c3\u00a9tanque or having piquenikes.

There was also a few places we went to a few times in that area. One restaurant that we like was called the Ecole Militaire, obviously name for the Ecole Militaire right across the street. It was tasty. There was also a nearby, late night bar that we got to know one of the bartenders. It was a fun place to stop on the way back to the hotel at night. The neighborhood was very quiet and we were told by a taxi driver that it was a more affluent district, the 7th arrondissement I believe. There wasn't too much night activity as there was not many hotels that I noticed in the area.

As this was her first trip to Paris (& possibly her ONLY visit) I wanted somewhere special to end the trip. For years she had longed to see the Eiffel Tower, so I felt a tower view was a must & began trawling the TripAdvisor site for likely hotels. Because of the excellent reviews, I chose Hotel Duquesne & everything clicked perfectly into place from the very first email. I booked Room 55 (which they say is the best room in the hotel) & it may even be the best room in all of Paris, with its wrap around balcony & fantastic view of the Eiffel tower. We did an evening tour of Paris, bought some cheese, bread & a bottle of Eugene Rothschild champagne for a late night feast while watching the twinkling lights of the tower change to a diamond cascade every hour. (Many apologies to the staff for the crumbs we left behind!) Later, my cousin moved her bed so she could lie there watching the very last of the lights from her pillow. Truly a magical way to close what had been a wonderful trip through Italy & France. Room 55 cost us Euro 198 which worked out to about $NZ380 - far more than our usual budget of Euro 90 per room, but I feel for the room itself. the location of the hotel & the service from management & staff it's probably very reasonable indeed by Paris standards. I cannot speak too highly of this hotel & its staff. My emails were promptly returned & all questions answered courteously. The manager tried every way to find us a shuttle to CdeG next morning, but when this proved impossible, arranged for a taxi to take us to the RER station at Invalides instead. One hears too much about the inhospitality of the Parisiennes. I must be fortunate as I have barely experienced it & I can positively state that the service in the Duquesne is second to none & the hotel richly deserves its many glowing reviews.

We were lucky to be able to get in to our room(#34) already for our 7 night stay. I haven't been to Paris for 25 years and stayed in dives or with friends previously, so don't know what to expect of a room in Paris these days, but it was well appointed with beautiful tasteful furnishings, a recently updated bathroom with gorgeous tiling and marble, and large sunny soundproof windows. It was me(a 47 year old male) and my 75 year old parents. They had a kingsize bed(two twins put together) and I had a single bed that acted as a sofa during the day. The room was quite spacious and we never felt cramped. I liked having the toilet room seperate and across the entryway from the bathroom(although a mini sink in the toilet room would have been nice). There was a fully stocked mini fridge(contents not free, of course) in our large wardrobe style closet next to the safe. No chest of drawers for storing clothing, but that seemed to be the norm in other hotels we stayed in other cities after Paris. I found the bathtub odd where you only had a clear glass divider that only protruded halfway out from the wall...ended up always spraying lots of water out on the floor. You only get to see the top third of the eiffel tower from the 3rd floor, and only if you stick your head out the window and look right, but it was still beautiful. The threesome rooms with a better view were already booked more than three months in advance, so book early for the summer months if views are important to you. They actually offered us a room with a better view for our first night, but we did not feel like moving after one night. Our room was $2136.00 for 7 nights, but did not include breakfast. I did ask nicely since we were staying so long if they could make an exception, and they did. I booked directly with the hotel. Breakfast was very nice with scrambled eggs, croissants, american style cereals, ham, yogurt, cheese, fruit salad(out of a can), coffee, and tea. There was never any deviation from the menu every day...always the same. Very quaint basement breakfast area. Nice lobby on the small side(mirrors make it look bigger) with small elevator. One beautiful Apple computer in the lobby for all guests to share. Be patient though. Often others were on it, and there were often access problems. I often had to use the french keyboard(one english, the other french) which takes getting used to, and they often had to sign me in with their manager's access code. All the staff were adequately friendly, but don't have grand ideas (after reading some of the gushing comments on this site). None of them would speak or look at me unless spoken to. Also, Leeloo, the dog, never showed up. Never took the public buses, but Ecoile Militaire metro stop is close. Unfortunately, that line won't take you anywhere you want, so you can't be afraid to switch to get to where you really want to go. The eiffel tower is an easy 15 minute walk. There are plenty of pleasant cafes nearby, and we loved the Thai restaurant literally next door to your right as you exit the hotel, and the cafe literally to your left(with a very friendly waiter). The Indian restaurant nearby is excellent too, but the waitstaff could be friendlier.

Two blocks from the metro, so close to the Eiffel Tower and Napolean's Tomb (Les Invalides). Rue St. Clair was a few blocks away, start your morning there and pick up bread, fresh cheese, fruits, chocolates, wine. Keep some supplies in your room, as you'll wake up at strange hours initially, and be hungry. There is no coffee/hot water in the room, although there is small bar downstairs that will make hot water, drinks, etc. for you. The entire room and bathroom looked newly redecorated, marble and quartz in the bathroom, very, very clean and modern. Bus 69, across the street from the hotel, will take you on a tour around the city and bring you back again. Staff was friendly and helpful.

The room is a decent size and I would characterize it as being cruise ship stateroom efficient. Not cramped, but no wasted space either. The W/C is in a separate little closet away from the sink and shower adding to efficiency. The bathroom was operating room-clean. Spotless upon arrival and it was maintained as such through out our stay. The staff, especially the women, could not have been nicer, friendlier or more helpful.

First of all, the location on this gem cannot be beat. It is located within a 10-minute stroll from the Eiffel Tower, one block from the Invalides (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Napoleon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tomb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the Warfare Museum (a must for medieval armor and knights\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 gear that is not represented at the Louvre)) and two blocks from a Metro station Ecole Millitaire on the 8th line. Rue Cler, a cozy cobblestone pedestrian street with multitude of shops, cafes and food markets is also very close by. For the first two days we stayed in room #55, which I assume has the best view of the Eiffel Tower in the entire hotel and a real balcony (as opposed to Juliette balconies on other floors). The tower is right there in your window in its full glory. However, due to the size of the room & the location of the furniture it is impossible to see it from the bed, which cannot be moved to the side as the headboard is attached to the wall. However, some clever positioning will let you see it from a teeny tiny bathtub \u00e2\u02dc\u00ba. For our last night, we were moved to room #44, which also had the view of the Eiffel Tower, but you had to look out of the window to see it. No big deal, as we were so exhausted from all the sightseeing that we used our room primarily for resting/sleeping purposes. Surprisingly, this room was much bigger than room 55 with a bigger bathtub and a separate toilet room, European style. Overall, the hotel is small and cozy, the lobby is pretty and the Reception Desk is attentive and extremely helpful with everything (they helped us a lot with those plug converters). The rooms themselves are small but very well decorated and clean. We had breakfast at the hotel once and for 24 Euros that we were charged, we could have totally gotten something better outside the hotel. The food was excellent and served in the beautiful basement dining room, which was probably one of the neatest hotel dining areas that I have ever seen, but the value was just not there if you are used to eating small breakfast. (Of course, if you like buffet style breakfast or breakfast is the meal of your day, you will enjoy it immensely). Now, some overall tips on the area and Paris in general. It was our first trip here and despite reading tons of reviews and guidebooks we still managed to have some hick-ups that were easily avoidable. First, we took everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advice on using Metro for all of our travel needs and boy this was good advice. The system is very easy to use and gets you everywhere within minutes. Transfers are easy and the longest we waited for a train was 5 minutes. However, we failed to take advantage of the unlimited pass deal. When we wanted to buy our first Metro ticket, we saw that there was an option to buy an unlimited 3-day pass, but when the clerk told us it was 40 Euros per person, we backed off and we should not have. This pass allows unlimited travel for 3 days on ALL public transportation, including metro, buses and RER trains (airport and Versailles trains). Considering that one ride on the train for 2 people is 3.20 Euros and 2 tickets to Versailles and the airport are 30Euros, we should have taken the unlimited deal. So, if you are a heavy sightseer, take the unlimited pass and you will save some Euros. Second, we found the food to be excellent. A lot of people on this website recommended Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Du Marche on Rue Cler for meals and we did eat there twice but were not as impressed. It seemed a little on the cheaper side and on Sunday morning we found a bunch of drunk French men crowding the bar area and the waitress who served us breakfast had such dirty nails that I literally wanted to get up and leave. The food is also nothing to write home about. We tried the place across from Marche, Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Central and found it way classier in d\u00c3\u00a9cor, service and food quality. We also tried the Ulysses for crepes that one of the reviewers raved about and were disappointed to see them re-heat the crepes instead of making them from scratch. We generally followed Frommer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Guide to Paris (check it out for awesome walking tours of Marais, Montmartre and the Latin Quarter) and tried some of the restaurants that he recommended. But none of those restaurants came even close to the place right next to the Duquesne Hotel that was recommended to us by the Reception. The place is called 7eVino (still not sure what the heck it means) and it is located by the Ecole Millitaire Metro station (across the street from the big La Terraza restaurant). It is a small intimate restaurant (only 16 tables) with the most personable service that we have ever experienced. We come from NYC, the city of restaurants, but the owner of this place blew it out of the box for us. The food was amazing, just the right combination of traditional and modern French cuisine. Once we came in, the owner gave us complimentary glasses of wine and made sure we were 100% happy during the course of our meal. We tried escargots (Burgundy snails \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 6.5EU per 6 snails), oysters and I had beef in duck liver sauce (19EU), the taste of which I will never forget. The wine selection is amazing at this place and is very reasonably priced (average of 4EU per glass). The cr\u00c3\u00a8me-brulee desert (7EU) was heavenly. We came back for dinner the next day and the owner, who by the way speaks fluent English, gave us one of the reserved tables and arranged a complimentary wine and cheese platter within seconds. We had another heavenly dining experience with a baked prawn and scallop appetizer and roasted duck and fish specials. Hands down, the best meal ever! It does take a while for your food to arrive so make sure you allocate a lot of time when you come to this place. But overall, this restaurant was one of the highlights of our Paris stay. Upon departure, the owner personally came to say goodbye to us and gave me a long-stemmed rose from a huge bouquet that was standing on the bar to commemorate Valentine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day. Third, a Versailles trip is a must! We wanted to skip it first, but then reconsidered when we saw Napoleon III\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apartments at the Louvre. The trip to the Chateau is painless and quick (1 Metro stop and then 30 minutes on a RER C train) and is totally worth it. One huge TIP: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE TICKETS BEFORE YOU ARRIVE TO THE CHATEAU (you can buy them online before you depart to Paris). When we got off the train in Versailles, there was a tour guide advising people to buy the tickets at the tour agency right across the street from the station, but we totally disregarded the advice, thinking that the line cannot be that bad in February. And of course, we were completely wrong. We stood in line for at least an hour and in the end, we bought tickets at the ticket machine (credit cards only) located in the lobby of the ticket office. The machine had absolutely no line and if we knew about it, we would not have wasted an hour on that ridiculous queue. So if you do arrive without tickets, check the lobby first to see if the machines are working (3 out of 4 of them were broken) to save yourself some time. After snapping some beautiful pictures of the Opera House, we visited the Galleries Lafayette, Paris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest and most famous shopping mall and it was an interesting experience to see European fashion (and prices!) at its best. The main hall of the mall is incredibly beautiful. I mainly did window-shopping as the prices are insane but I am pretty sure some reasonably-price shopping can be done on the street where the mall is located as I saw European H&M, GAP, Benetton & Zara there. We decided not to use the airport shuttle on the way back and took the Metro to the airport. The trip was a little complicated as there were a bunch of stairs to climb during transfers, but we got to CDG in about an hour after leaving the hotel. The cost for 2 people was 17EU but it could have been avoided if you had the unlimited Paris pass. (We got on at the Ecole Millitaire station and took Line 8 to Invalides station and then took Line 1 to Chatelet where we transferred to the B train to CDG). Overall, we had an amazing trip. In general, I would advise to avoid the Metro after 9pm as it seemed to be full of sketchy people and use the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big city radar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when visiting the major tourist cites that are swarming with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153souvenir sellers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with dubious intentions.", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cA terrific stay...\u201d", "Author": "collee09", "ReviewID": "UR55676747", "Content": "I really can't say enough great things about this hotel.

To our delight, they all spoke english and never tired of our many questions regarding metro's, buses, show tickets and directions to museums and other sites. I will also comment that even before we arrived to the hotel, my emails with questions were answered quickly and completely. Special thanks to Oliver, Helene, Jennifer, Jessica, Alain and Patrick for making us feel so welcomed during our entire stay. There is a shuttle service that the hotel can arrange for a pickup from the airport...very reasonable at 36 Euros for 2 persons--this shuttle service can also pickup at the HDE for a return to the airport. The room was cozy and clean. It did not matter the small size of the room since we could lay in bed and look to the Eiffel Tower---a priceless experience while in Paris!! The lobby was welcoming to sit and read or to use their computer. If you bring your laptop, they only offer wireless in the lobby, to present. The breakfast was delicious, though with the same foods offered every day, we opted to only eat there a few days during our stay. The Rue Cler neighborhood is sweet and safe and very much the feeling of a small town in itself. We enjoyed Bus 69 which is a local bus that takes you all around the city--very reasonable for all the sights seen along the way.

Coffee was good and with Rick Steves' book you get an Amercan breakfast with an egg and ham for 6 E. For a cheap dinner go the Tribecca on Rue Cler. Great food and service but 4 days in a row was a little t0o much for us. For excellent but slightly more expensive food try Le Florimond on Avenue de La Motte Picquet which is located at the end of Rue Cler. It is not open on Saturday and Sunday and doesn't open their doors at night until 7:00 PM. Stop by the night before and make reserations. Also go to the Restaurant Pasco which is farther down de La Motte Picquet. Walk doiwn past La Florimond and when you get to the corner turn right and you will see it 50 feet down the next street on the right. Both of these last two were very good restaurants and worth every penny. For a big time expensive meal go to La Fontaine de Mars and see why Obama ate there. Don;t eat dessert at any of the restaraunts. Stop off on the way back from sightseeing and buy desserts at the Lenore which is located between the Metro station and the Post Office on De La Motte Picquet. The cheesecake was light and tasty. The chocolate candies were terrific but I couldn't see buying a box of chocolate and a dessert. If you need to convert American dollars go to the Post Office. Best conversion rate in town. If you stay here say hello to Jennifer and Jessica. They worked the front desk many of the days we were there and tipped us off to much of what I have listed here. There is computer available in the lobby so you can check your email. They also had a limited number and types of power converters you could borrow. Great stay and if I ever go back I would stay here again. Especially since it was up to my wife's standards", "Date": "November 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Encino, CA", "Title": "\u201cFireworks for Bastille Day from our balcony!\u201d", "Author": "Tangosnow", "ReviewID": "UR48643305", "Content": "Went to the Duquesne on recommendation of friends, who often stay there.

After arriving at Gare Du Nord via Eurostar, the transportation company I had arranged was waiting for us after getting off the train. I would highly recommend a transportion service, particularly with a family of four. Two cabs would be needed, and the taxi cues at the Gare Du Nord are famously long after a train arrives. It was 60 euro for a minivan to take us all and luggage through Easy Transfer Service of Paris. They were always on time, and made our transfers effortless. It was a quick 10-15 minute ride to Duquesne Eiffel. The check in at the hotel was quick and easy, and all of the front desk staff were friendly and able to answer any questions on how to get to places from there. They provided maps with the directions, and all spoke fluent English. The elevator is small, and will only accomodate four people, so people and luggage took us two trips, but we were aware of this before we booked. We found small elevators to be the norm in Europe at the smaller hotels. This is similar to the transportation problem: A taxi would only handle two people and luggage, like the elevator. Our biggest concern on this trip was finding hotels with air conditioning. As we progessed from London to Paris to Rome, finding hotels with air conditioning became an increasing challenge. This hotel had great air conditioning. The hotel is located two blocks from the Ecole Militare metro station for easy access to the subway system. There are bank ATM's, small grocery store, and a famous local French pastry shop and bistro's within the two block trip to the metro station. The rooms are smaller than usual, and we were prepared for that. We read a review of someone who left immediately because of the small rooms. The hotel is a 17th century building, hence the room size, but for lack of size, the rooms were completly updated recently with modern features, and very clean. The room our kids had was a bit bigger than ours with two twin size beds. As before, the important feature for us was that the air conditioning was great. The bathrooms are small as well , but very well appointed for their size. We do not spend a lot of time in the room anyway, so being for lack of room was not a problem for us. The free wifi had to be obtained in the lobby, as they were in the middle of gaining a new contract service for wifi when we were there. There is a small bar in the lobby as well with drinks that are not overpriced. The rooms have a keyed safe, obtaining the key on request from the front desk, as well as a minibar that is not terribly overpriced as they are in the US. But, as I mentioned, there is a small store a block away where drinks and snacks, etc. can be bought. The service of the room was outstanding; never intrusive, and immaculate on return from a day out. The continental breakfast is served in the basement in what could have been an old wine cellar. There was French bacon, like Canadian bacon, scrambled eggs, as well as cerals, toast, coffee, juice, etc. The service personnel where all very friendly and helpful. I couldn't help but leave a few euros for a tip, although it is not expected. The hotel is a couple of blocks from the Ecole Militare, at the end of the Champs Du Mars, making about a fifteen minute walk to the Eiffel Tower. The front desk personnel warned us to hang on tightly to our cameras around the Eiffel Tower from snatch and grab theives. We did make it to the top of the Eiffel Tower in the early evening, and it was well worth the 45 minute wait to start our way up. The view at night was incredible. Among other sights we visited in the four days we were in Paris: The Louvre was an all day affair to see a third of it as we well knew. It worked out well that day since it rained. Notre Dame, as well as an organ recital there one night. A day trip to Versaille with Fat Tire Bike Tours; I wrote a review of the wonderful trip we had. Montmartre for the girls to go shopping. We even made it to P\u00c3\u00a8re Lachaise Cemetery to visit the grave of Jim Morrison. We liked this hotel, although I would not recommend it for people not used to some of the smaller features of European hotels. Anything with the expected space of American chains will cost twice as much in a central location such as this.

If you use streetview for the US, you will be amazed at how much better the Paris version is. E.g., you can zoom in 4 times and read 2 inch font on storefronts - the photos seem to be equal to 2-3 megapixel cameras versus the just 1 megapixel version in the US. We used this feature to find HSBC ATMs in the neighborhood. (see pic of La Terrasse restaraunt attached) -Shower Interesting swing out door that seems to invite water to leap onto the floor took some gettign used to. However, by the second try I had mastered the relatively dry shower technique and did not flood the place. See the pics - the door swings out and covers only half the tub surface, so water splash goes everywhere if you are showering. If you are tubbing, be aware that this a half tub and unless you are 3 ft tall, won't be able to stretch out. Not t a biggie for me as I prefer showers. -Window Came with a nice sidestreet view (see pic) and was really dead silent when closed. Really - there was construction down the street with jackhammers that were rendered silent - not quiet, but dead silent when I closed the window. And, we heard no other guest room noise. -A/C Is not US spec A/C. So, it does not get extremely cold. It keeps the room reasonably cool, about 75F, but not cold. Several nights dipped to the low 60s and I simply opened the window because the street noise was not that bad. There is a dial on the wall, but ignore it, becuase we kep it at \"full blast\" for the entire week we were there and the temps never went below 75F. Again, not a huge deal, but there is no really cold breeze, it comes from the ceiling at a drip and a slow drip at that. That said, it was not enough of a problem to complain about, even on a 95F day. -Location Within about 7 minutes walking to the Eiffel tower and 5 minutes to Champs de Mars, the perfect picnic location. Nice, safe, quiet neighborhood. We felt fine coming home late at night. -Staff Perfect and helpful. Enough said. -Tip There is a shoe buffer-type machine in the lobby to clean you shoes after you have been off galavanting in the tan powdery dirt of Paris - which is everywhere - use it. The carpets are dark and show the foot prints if you do not. -Lobby internet Stop at the fron desk to get a free login password and check your email. The speed, according to speedtest.net was fairly low (0.96mbps down and 0.23mbps up), but perfectly suited for checking the weather and email. Great public-use Apple in the lobby if you don't have a laptop. -Breakfast We didn't eat at the hotel becuase there were so many cafes within easy walking distance. For an excellent continental breakfast that will carry you for hours of walking, try La Terrasse de 7eme, mentioned in Rick Steve's Paris 2009 book. It is on the corner of Avenue Bosquet and Avenue De La Motte Picquet, within sight of the hotel. For 12 euros, you get a few slices of ham, 2 eggs, caf\u00c3\u00a9 creme (incredible coffee with cream), two slices of white toast to dab the eggs, a 10-inch buttered half baguette, two jellies, sugar cubes, and a huge croissant.

Reservation online was fast and easy on their official website - old website layout but I understood from the girls at frontdesk that they will have a new website very soon. Rate was same as on Booking/Venere... and rate was in line with competitor hotels nearby. Check-in's been fast and easy. Efficient girls at reception. Unfortunately I put my room card key by my blackberry case (the one with a magnet inside, which means my card key did not work. When I went down to reception to get it activated again, it took a few seconds and staff was willing to help. The room had a great view to the Eiffel tower. Room size was quite good for a 3* property in Paris. Separate toilets. Bathroom was small but I'd rather have extra square meters in room itself than in the bathroom. Very good bed. Flat TV with lots of channels. minibar with reasonable rates: a Perrier was 2.60 Euros. Usually I pay 3 to 4 Euros for a Perrier in hotel minibars. I checked details such as hangers, bathroom line, guest supplies... and everything was cleaned and where it was expected to be. When hangers are different and bad ones, it reflects a good idea of how the hotel is maintained and managed. At the Duquesne Eiffel, their maids know their job. Air conditioing worked well and did not smell. Carpet was cleaned. I did not use their free high speed Internet access since I'm using a 3G card everywhere I go in France. So many hotels have been late providing such a basic service as HSIA that travellers like me have a 3G card in laptop. However, while waisting time waiting for a friend in hotel lobby I checked available wireless networks and found theirs.In hotel lobby they provide free use of a Mac computer with very large screen and 2 keyboard - 1 french and 1 English, next to the bar. Breakfast room is lovely. There was everything needed, including eggs, ham, cheese. Unsual in a 40 room parisian hotel. Breakfast room is small but staff seems to be efficient and refresh tables fast. Coffee was good breakfast coffee - it is funny saying that but I experienced so many terrible coffees elsewhere... Checkout's been fast and easy. \"Have you had something from the minibar\", a few clicks on their computer and I got a printed bill that was right. They called a taxi for me. I have stayed many times on left bank but can't remember having stayed in 7th district. This is very quiet, very accessible - metro is one block away. It looks easy to park outside. Easy access to main train stations. At 8.30am it tooks my taxi driver less than 8 minutes to get to the Chamsp Elys\u00c3\u00a9es. I'll stay there again soon... Congratulations to management.

We stayed at the Hotel Duquesne for the duration of our holiday, and chose it after reading so many positive reviews on Trip Advisor. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re so happy we did...we absolutely loved it! The location is perfect: in a quiet neighbourhood near the Eiffel Tower, Hotel Invalides & Napolean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tomb, the Rodin museum, and the Rue Cler area. If you like to walk (and you can do plenty of it in Paris!), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s within walking distance of the Louvre and Tuileries Gardens, Place de la Concorde, the Orangerie and Orsay museums, Grand and Petit Palais, and Pont de l\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Alma (site of Princess Di\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accident). But the Ecole Militaire metro stop is also close by and the system is so easy to use, you can get anywhere in Paris in very little time. The hotel itself is charming; the outside fa\u00c3\u00a7ade is quaint with little tables set out front \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perfect for enjoying a quiet drink outside. The lobby, reception and bar area is well kept, and the provided laptop and free lobby WiFi access is a nice bonus. The staff, both day and night staff, are efficient, pleasant and courteous, and their English is far better than my limited French. Julie, Jennifer and Marieaux (sp?) were very helpful both during email exchanges before the trip, and to all of our inquiries during our stay. The elevator is definitely the smallest I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d read about it, but was still surprised to see it when we arrived. You can fit 4 people who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind getting close, or one person and two suitcases. Since we had three cases, we each went up separately, but this was no inconvenience at all. I had reserved our room well in advance and specifically requested room # 55 (Gustave Eiffel), based on the recommendation of Trip Advisor contributors. It was an absolutely lovely room. While small in comparison to North American standards, it was perfect for Paris, where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not expected to spend much time in your room. And truthfully, the size contributed to the Parisien feel for us. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was contemporary, and the wardrobe, dresser, desk and night stand drawers provided adequate storage for our needs. The bathroom was very clean and it was such a thrill to be able to lounge in a bubble bath and gaze out at the Eiffel Tower through the balcony window! Which brings me to the best part of this hotel...the view. We expressly wanted a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a better view for your money than Hotel Duquesne! I never did get over the thrill of opening the balcony doors and looking straight at the Tower...it was a highlight of the trip for me! Our room had a wrap-around balcony and provided some great views of the city. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, and plan on staying here again on our next trip to Paris. The only constructive criticism I would have is with regards to attention to details. When I made our reservation, I explained that we were going to be in Paris to celebrate our 10th anniversary, and I indicated which day that would be. Typically, a hotel will make note of special occasions and then acknowledge it in some way during a guest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthis did not happen. Further, a day previous, I asked Jennifer to make a dinner reservation for our anniversary at Le Florimond (a very nice restaurant we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d read about in Rick Steve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paris 2009 book). She graciously did, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mention to them that we were there for our anniversary. At the end of a truly delicious meal, I asked for a picture to be taken of us, explaining that this was our 10th anniversary. I was told that they typically do something special for couples celebrating occasions and would gladly have done so for us had they known. This in no way took away from the wonderful anniversary and stay that we had, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s those kind of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153little\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd details that separates a first-class, 4-5 star property from others.", "Date": "June 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "washington", "Title": "\u201cDuquesne Eiffel is the best hotel I ever stayed in!\u201d", "Author": "happyinparis123", "ReviewID": "UR32487173", "Content": "I don't really know where to start, but my mother and I had made reservations via the internet to a hotel that is located a block away from this hotel.

While the fireworks were a bit disappointing (because of the heavy fog, we figured) this hotel was certainly not! We made our reservations through their official website, and we didn't have any problems with it at all. I exchanged a few e-mails with Julie Palisse, who replies to the reviews here, and she was extremely helpful with answering any questions I had. We also ordered their airport transfer service, which was quite efficient and convenient; the annoying part, however, was having to wait for the car outside the airport gate in the cold for much longer than we had been told. Our first impression upon entering the hotel was a very good one: the interior was clean, cozy, and the staff at the reception was not only quite friendly, but also spoke very good English. We stayed in room 18, a standard double room that had no view, but was very nicely decorated. It was, of course, small, but that should always be expected in Paris. Everything was spotless clean, and the bed was absolutely fantastic (something very important after a long day of walking and sightseeing). Unavoidably, the bathroom was indeed small, but since it was just as well-taken-care-of as the rest of the room, that was not a problem. Something worth mentioning is that we never really figured out how to make the air conditioning work as we wanted it to. So I guess we were lucky that even though the room was always very hot when we returned from a day out, the problem could be easily and quickly solved by leaving the windows open for a few minutes. Admittedly though, we could have just called the reception. One of the reasons why we picked the Duquesne in the first place was its location, and it was on a par with our expectations in that aspect as well. The Eiffel Tower was within walking distance, and so were a few subway stations (which is really all you'll ever need to get around in Paris). Although the street the hotel was actually in didn't have many services or amenities, it was relatively quiet, which was a bonus at night. Besides, there were many other streets nearby that more than made up for it, with their many boulangeries, brasseries and shops in general. Rue Cler is particularly worth mentioning, offering many options of places to eat, have a drink or even just buy some fresh bread, cheese and good wine for a simpler, economic but still delicious meal in the hotel room. We usually ate breakfast around that area too, since the menus offered were quite filling and still cheaper than the hotel breakfast, but we did choose to indulge and ask for room service on the morning of January 1st. With a generous assortment of breads, jams, juice and coffee, plus the added convenience of having a breakfast for two in bed, we think the meal was fairly priced. Finding affordable places to have dinner in the direct area of the hotel wasn't easy, but upon asking at the reception for a suggestion, we were told about Le 7\u00c3\u00a8me Vin: while it wouldn't be accurate to say it was an inexpensive place, it was definitely the most charming, and the best meal we had during our stay. We believe the hotel staff definitely contributed to make our trip even better: the service was excellent, from the receptionists to the housekeeping ladies. Coming back from a tiring day to find our room as cozy and clean as it was on the first day we arrived was always a very pleasant part of our routine in Paris. We were even surprised by a box of chocolate-coated nuts waiting for us in the room after New Year's, so we were glad to be able to show our appreciation with a few small gifts to the staff as well. Just writing this review and remembering the many good memories from the trip has really reminded us of how much want to come back. My boyfriend is from the Netherlands and it was his first time in Paris, hopefully out of many more to come.

The room was very very small, and the decor was old - infact some of the wallpaper was peeling and badly marked. The toilet was half the size of the room - which was frustrating as it was a waste of precious space. The breakfast was expensive and average at best.

All the above does not make this a bad hotel, but my last thing is the worst- we found one hotel clerk in particular to be unfriendly and at one time just plain rude and mean. There was little or no explanation when we checked in about services from him. We went looking for ice and wound up being scolded like children for looking in the bar area for it.

After a lot of searching on the internet after a good, well-positioned and price-acceptable hotel, I have come across Hotel Duquesne Eiffel. The location seemed perfect for us with two subway stations close by. The Eiffel tower is close to the hotel so this tall tower can be used as an orientation point when walking from or to the hotel. Reviews on Tripadvisor and the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pictures looked great. Luckily I have found an offer on www.hotel.de which included a double room with breakfast buffet and welcome drink (100 euros per night for the whole, min. stay 2 nights) so I have booked it immediately. This offer wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t available on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website. If you are booking a hotel in advance (2-3 months before the trip) or taking a trip in the next days, you can find various good-value offers (e.g. early bird offers, last minute offers) so search through more websites (HRS.de, hotel.de, FastBooking.com, Expedia.de) before booking the hotel. The feature of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Check rates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the tripadvisor is very helpful to see the price differences on most of the hotel booking websites, these price differences can be quite high on certain occasions. Upon arrival and during our stay of 4 nights, the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. In the lobby, you can find a laptop with internet connection for free use. Our room was on the 4th floor with a view to the Eiffel tower. I was admiring it every morning when waking up and every evening before going to sleep. I had a W-Lan connection in our room, but, due to some miss-configuration, the internet didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work unfortunately. It is well-known that hotel rooms is Paris are small so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised. Our room was tasteful and nicely furnished, its size was comfortably enough for two people. The bathroom was modernly equipped. The location of the hotel is even better than I thought when booking this hotel. Visiting Paris by foot is the best way to get a real taste of the city so we took nice walks to most of the sights starting from the hotel in the morning. The neighborhood seemed safe; we, two women, walked back to the hotel every evening without any fear, only by following the Eiffel tower from a distance. A good idea is to plan your daily itinerary upfront in order visit every day the sights close by in one chose area by foot if possible. We used the subway only for coming from and going to the airport. We had lovely chats with the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owner who stayed at the reception every evening and appreciated all the tips about Paris which he gave us. The breakfast buffet was delicious and more than sufficient to charge our energy for the upcoming long day. Various choices are available: ham and cheese, omlette and bacon, 4-5 different fruit jams, 4 types of cereals, orange and grapefruit juice, milk, coffee, tee and last but not least the typical French bakery products: croissant, pain au chocolat, pain au raisins and baguette.

The other hotel was not nice..and we were told that the whole city was sold out and it was the only equal hotel they could find. The next day we came back and they had our room ready, and it was totally gorgeous! It was completely renovated, and a real retreat after walking all day in Paris.

The facilities inside the room were good including a mini-bar service, flat screen T.V. and modern/new shower unit. The only things worthy of critical comment are pretty minimal, however so that others are aware: if you stay in rooms at the end of a corridor you need to know where the light switch is, to illuminate the area in front of your door, otherwise it can be quite difficult to see the handle and unlock the door. Once you've found the light ouside the door for the first time it's no problem from then on. There are some areas with suspended panels for the celing and when you open/close a door the pressure can sometimes cause these to move and they can startle you a little.

Location is very good since it is near a Metro station and some notable spots like Rue de Cler, and the Eiffel Tower. Area also felt very safe. Glitch we experienced during our stay was that the hotel staff who checked us in did not give us a complete orientation. Finding our room was a bit difficult since the hallways were dark. The motion sensitive lights in the hallways on our floor did not always work. Also, staff did not tell us on how to turn on the lights in our room. We were supposed to insert the card key in the light switch to turn on the power. Then our safe did not have a key and we were given the option to leave our valuables in the front desk. Not that we did not appreciate the effort by Julie.

Even the guy who checked us in was helpful in providing us hot drinking water late at night for my grandmother's tea. Probably he just needs more training on how to entertain guests.

Our room was on the 6th floor (European 5th). Again, the room was tiny, but this time we had a queen-sized bed that was very comfortable, with a choice of hard or soft pillows. The room had a small balcony, from which if you stretched way out, you could indeed see the Eiffel Tower. It was quiet and no bug spray smell! However, the towels were worn and threadbare.

It included both hot and cold items; very runny scrambled eggs, wafer thin slices of ham, cereal, yogurt, coffee, pastries and juice.

Frankly, I wouldn't have paid $18 USD for that breakfast when a 10 minute walk to the Rue Cler would have bought me a great selection of pastries and pain du chocolat, but it was included with my tour, so I didn't have to pay extra for it.

We got checked in right away and were given the room I had requested some 9 months before when I booked - one with a great view of the Eiffel Tower. We were in the Eiffel Tower Room (appropriately named!) on the 4th floor, and, let me tell you, it was wonderful to have our first good look at the tower come from the hotel room! We would spend some very romantic moments gazing at the sparkling tower at night from our window. Being in a big European city, the room was small, of course, but quite comfortable. Everything was super clean, and I'm very observant about that sort of thing when it comes to hotels. There was the queen bed, a dresser-ish piece of furniture with a mini fridge in it, a desk with a chair, a flat screen TV, a small closet, the bathroom with sink and shower/tub, and a separate toilet closet. One thing I found very nice is how sound-insulated the windows were. When open, you heard the usual city noise, but when closed, it was extremely quiet. We didn't partake of the 11 euro breakfast, so I can't comment on that. Instead, we went around the corner to the nearby Rue Cler where there are fruit stands and bakeries to put together a nice breakfast from. Our first morning there, we bought some croissants, beignets (more dense than New Orleans beignets), nectarines, orange juice, and goat cheese (the cheese was all for hubby, bleh) and walked down to the Eiffel Tower where we found a nice park bench on which to enjoy our meal. A much preferable experience to breakfasting in a hotel, IMO. The hotel is very convenient to everything since the metro stop is so close, and with the metro cost very reasonable, we traveled all over the city with no problem.

We stupidly agreed to this arrangement not knowing that Splendid wasn't so splendid. the only redeeming part was that we had a view of the Eiffel Tower from our hotel window. But after getting our room at Duquesne the next day (they took our bags for us), we realized that Duquesne was so much nicer. We didnt' have a view of the Tower, but the bed, bathroom and room was so much nicer. Breakfast was covered for us, because of their mishap, which was great. Eggs, ham, good coffee, etc. 2nd part: came back to Hotel Duquesne after a couple more cities in Europe and it felt like home instantly. They gave us a room on the 4th floor with a perfect view of the Eiffel. If we go back I'll definitely request that room.

The Duquesne Eiffel Hotel is located in the 7th arrondissement of Paris, close to the Eiffel Tower, Invalides and the Musee Rodin. We like this area of Paris, it's quiet and safe, close enough to the sights to either walk or take a short metro ride, close to the Rue cler area where there are a lot of restaurants and patisseries. We stayed at a budget hotel in the Latin Quarter the last time we visited and were disappointed so this time I was looking for something affordable but nice and found it at this hotel. The reception staff was very pleasant, not particularly helpful on restaurants but fortunately we had printed out some recommendations in advance. They had a computer set up in the lobby where we checked our email which was very nice for us. Breakfast was not included in our rate of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac102, it was an additional \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11 so we got breakfast at a local patisserie instead since we just want a pastry. We had a standard double room, there are also comfort rooms and superior rooms, some of which appear to have a view of the Eiffel Tower and balconies. We booked the room on booking.com, the rate was lower than their normal rate I assume because it was August when a lot of people avoid going to Paris since a lot of Parisians vacation at that time. Room 58-very clean, our room was not overly large but certainly big enough for the two of us. The bed was comfortable with plenty of pillows. The room had a plasma TV with the extremely odd feature of being able to rotate the picture so it was upside down or reversed, air conditioning, minibar with just a small amount of extra space for your own stuff and modern decor, looked to be newly remodeled. No view from our room but then again we didn't pay for one. Bathroom-plenty spacious, very clean, shower and tub with good water pressure and plenty of hot water, toiletries included shampoo/bath gel on the wall in the tub, lotion, emory boards and a few other things I didn't need.

It was room 10 and it was basically a bed with about 6 inches on either side. The bathroom was tiny as well as only one person could stand at it at a time. There was no real storage in the hotel room either but that being said, it was the most comfortable bed ever and we slept well into the first morning there. The next day we requested an upgrade and were immediately shown a deluxe room that was still small by North American standards but was much more appropriate. The Staff: For the most part we were very pleased with them. They all spoke good english and were able to help us with any problem. They were having a computer problem while we were there so our upgrade took some time but as we ended up with what we wanted, we arent' going to complain.

All in all, while it was not the nicest hotel we stayed in on our honeymoon, it was a very comfortable stay and we would recommend it, although only the upgraded room.

We could not have picked a nicer hotel. The hotel is located very near the Metro stop Ecole Militaire about 3 blocks away and once you get the gist of the subway it is a great way to get around. You can buy a \"Visite Pass\" which gives you unlimited use of the trains and buses for a certain number of days. We bought a 3 day Visite and when that was done we got a carnet of tickets ( a 10 pack of tickets ) and used that.Our hotel was in the 7th arrondismont literally a 10 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower. Our room overooked the street and we could just catch a glimpse of the Eiffel Tower when it was lit up at night. The hotel sits on a corner and it is very convienent to many sites that are very nearby. Les Invalides , where Napolean is buried is right down the street, the Eiffel Tower is very close by, The Rodin Musum is around the corner from Les Invalides that is where the famous statue of The Thinker is . It is a magnificient statue and it sits outside in the middle of a rose garden- fabulous!! The mostly pedestrian only street called The Rue Cler is one block behind the Ecole Mitaire Metro stop. We really enjoyed Rue Cler , it is a slice of life for the local Parisien. There is a boulangerie called The Artisan where you get the best croisannts ,baguettes and pastries. We ate breakfast at Le Pettitte Bistro next to the Post office , and dinner at a restaurant down further called Tribeca both were excellent. If you are a Rick Steves fan he recommends them both. We also ate at la Terasse on the corner by the Metro stop Ecole Militaire, also very good food .The hotel has recently been remodeled and our room # 47 was beautiful. The windows are brand new and double glazed so there was no street noise at all, we were on the 4th floor just above the trees.The size is small but that is standard for Europe. It was very clean and everything was brand new ( linens - towels etc ) The closet is the only place to put your clothes, there are shelves and hangars. It was adequate for our stay of 5 days. The hotel staff were very nice especially Lucy who was a huge help with everything. All the staff spoke perfect english so there was no problem. It was so nice to meet Julie, the manager whom we've read so much about on Trip Advisor, she was very sweet and she should be proud of her staff. We had use of the hotels laptop computer and we were able to check our email and keep in touch with family back home. The hotel lobby was the last thing being remodeled and it was finished on the day we left, the floors looked great! We used the hop on/hop off Batobus boat tours as our transportation and also walked a lot! You can get the Batobus boat at the base of the Eiffel Tower and it literally stops at every major museum or place of interest. It was a nice and calm way to travel ,but it is not for those in a hurry. I loved it and found it to be reasonably priced.It will take you to The Lovre, Notre Dame, Champs d' Elysee, Orsay Museum etc.. most of the major museums are along the river Seine. We took the Metro up to Sacre Couer Church in Montmartre ( get off at Anvers and take the funicular up to the top, it costs one metro ticket approx 1.60 Euro for the funicular) the view from the steps of Sacre Couer down into the city of Paris are amazing. We looked around where the artists set up shop on Place du Terre right around the corner from Sacre Couer. My daughter had her portrait drawn for 35 Euros ( a little less than $ 50 US ) it was well worth it, it was an amazing experience, one I'm sure she'll never forget.

Electronic door locks, flatscreen TV, very well appointed bathroom amenities, modern furniture and a good number of power outlets (not in the bathroom however, which seemed to be common in the other hotels we stayed in Europe).

It is an excellent hotel, and the best value hotel I have used in Paris. I've been visiting Paris for 20 years and this is the best hotel (but not the most expensie) I've stayed in. Excellent location in a pleasant, quiet but very central area. Close to metro, but you can walk to many places in central Paris from the hotel. You can also stock up on mineral water, fruit, bread etc in shops nearby. The hotel is very stylish, in fact I'd say it is sophisticated - I got the impression that someone with an interior design background has been involved in this or they've paid a lot to get a good professional designer in. The room I stayed in was very nicely decorated and furnished - in fact better than most 4 star hotels I have stayed in. Everything was perfect, including the choice of paint colour on the woodwork and the inspired striped carpet! The lighting was unusually good - with all the lights on it was bright enough for me to read by, I'm really sick of dismal rooms when you turn the lights on full and you still can't read. Reception staff spoke fluent English, were efficient, friendly, and more approachable and helpful than I have found before in a Paris hotel. The breakfast serving staff were great also - good English, friendly, helpful. I'm not one for asking a lot of questions of reception staff, but I noticed some other English speaking guests doing so and the receptionist was really helping with advice, hints etc. Both check-in and check-out were rapid. The reason I booked here and not another place? Fire safety. I have a thing about it, and, being English, despair of why such an advanced country as France doesn't have the same standards we insist on in hotels in the UK. I only book Paris hotels if there are smoke detectors, which rules a lot of them out! And there are mains-wired detectors, and alarms, in the public areas - so I felt safe. But there didn't seem to be a smoke detector or alarm in my room. I was disappointed about this - I had read on some website (maybe not the hotel one, but one of the many that carry details about hotels) that there were smoke detectors or alarms in each room. If there was a detector or alarm in my room I could not find it. However, I would stay again - it's well built, and as well as the public areas coverage there was a sturdy fire door to segregate the bit of corridor my room was in from the rest of the corridor, and so I felt entirely safe. (PS I wish reviewers on tripadvisor would comment on this feature - a couple of years ago I stayed in a very positively reviewed Paris Hotel that I thought was a death-trap, with no smoke detectors or alarms - and yet there were dozens of people who'd written how nice the receptionists were! Hotels like this one, that invest in safety, should be acknowledged for this). Good quality flat screen tv with reasonable range of channels. A great view of the Eiffel Tower, shimmering and glittering. On a reasonably busy road but not too bad, and the double (or is it triple?) glazing highly effective. Good plumbing, in fact very good - easy to get the temperature balance right, and a proper shower screen (which you don't always get in Paris). I stay in hotels quite a lot, and this one was unusually clean. There is not even a hint of limescale build-up anywhere in the bathroom, and no dust. You get the impression that someone obsessive about quality is involved in running this hotel. Attention to detail is everywhere. I didn't use it, but there was a laptop with internet access and checking it briefly it seemed to be working okay. Oh, and whilst it's a newspaper I abhor and never buy because it attacks my home city (Liverpool), the English newspaper The Guardian was stocked. Nice for those English liberals, public servants and Liverpool-haters out there. Bed comfortable - I prefer a firm mattress and found it ok, not as hard as I like at home, but a good hard hotel firm. If I stay somewehre with a soft mattress I usualy end up sleeping on the floor, but no such problem here. I slept very well. Noise between rooms was a bit of a mystery to me so hard to judge after just one stay of just one night. Generally I think it's very good indeed - for an old building excellent. However, the doors close noisily and someone staying in a room close to me came back late and seemed to open and close the door a lot......the hall lights (movement activated?) may have confused them, I don't know. It woke me up. But no noise of neighbouring bathrooms (which is common in old converstions) or of TVs, which makes me think the sound insulation is good. I think if you are noise-phobic (as I am, as well as being fire-phobic and rudeness-phobic) you will probably get on well with this hotel. What can be improved? The quality of breakfast was acceptable but a bit disappointing for the price (12 euro) despite the lovely staff. Coffee in particular was a let-down - murky and just quite not good enough. I mainly stay in English hotels, where the quality of coffee has come on hugely in recent years, and sadly Paris hotels (this one is not alone) aren't quite there with coffee at the moment. Choice of food very limited. Just not quite good enough for the money. Okay, don't be put off, it's not a deal-breaker, but I think it could be improved. Served in a lovely stone room. The minibar prices are not at all good! 2.50 for a packet of crisps!!!!!!!!!! (chips to Americans). I know all hotels charge a lot for minibars, but with the pound-exchange rate being so bad, it just hurt as I arrived hungry and raided the mini-bar! Lots of little shops nearby, so don't make my mistake!

The bathroom was terrific and separate toilet were great for our stay. The receptionist was very friendly and helpful. Our room was not available when we got in around 11am but she told us to return around 12:30 or 1:30. We were able to walk directly to the Eiffel Tower - 10 to 15 minutes - and go directly up.

Having been to Paris three times previously, I have decided that nowhere could be better than the Hotel Duquesne Eiffel in the 7th Arr. (neighborhood area). I read a lot of reviews on Trip Advisor and decided this time on the Hotel Duquesne Eiffel--and I didn't go wrong! It is a charming hotel located across from the Ecole Militaire and about a block from Les Invalides in a beautiful area of boulevards, trees, and lovely cafes. Cross the boulevard, and walk directly to the Champs du Mars, the gorgeous park in which sits the Eiffel Tower! Just two blocks from the hotel is the Rue Cler market street (think chocolate, wine, flowers). Julie, the hotel's manager is a dream to work with. She helped me make the reservation directly with the hotel (and didn't get frustrated at all when my travel dates had to change). All of the staff are fluent in English and were most helpful in making reservations, taxi services, and offering directions. As an addicted-to-ice American, I even had that available from the lower-level kitchen! My room was lovely, and large compared to other places I have stayed in Paris. Of course, I was most fortunate to have a room on the 5th floor with a gorgeous view of the Eiffel Tower, glittering at night like a diamond pendant hanging from the sky. The hotel has recently undergone a decor change (from most online photos). The subtle tones of ecru, plum, green, and burgundy are most relaxing after a long day of working, walking, and sight seeing. The rooms are cleaned daily and everything in my room and bath was always spotless! Breakfast at the hotel is a bargain, particularly with a large pot of coffee, juice, eggs, and all of the wonderful pastries of Paris. Convenient to the hotel is the metro stop---the easiest and fastest way to get around Paris. From my metro I could travel with no difficulty to the area of the Louvre, Grand Boulevards, the Marais, Latin Quarter, and the outer areas of Paris.

Only needed to use Metro once. Don't miss Monet's WALLS of Water Lilies in the de l'Orangerie museun on the border of the beautiful Tuileries Garden which is in front of the Louvre. Monet's pond, gardens & house (Giverny) is worth the trip.- 50 miles north of Paris. If you can't fit it in -on the right bank is the Marmottan-Claude Monet museum. It has many of Monet's work. The most beautiful stained glass was in Saint Chapelle - not to be missed. We couldn't have found a sweeter hotel in a better spot. Why stay in a big city hotel when this boutique hotel has so much to offer? I searched for hours on the internet for a romantic hotel & we couldn't have been more pleased.

The very friendly but absolutely incompetent girl at the desk simply apologized but did not provide any kind of solution. We were basically told to grin and bear it, as it was a holiday in Paris and there was no staff to fix it. Changing rooms was not a possibility either. Later on the day, we asked for an iron, which of course was not available in the room. My husband was sent to a steamy room in the basement and had to iron his shirt himself, as again, there was no staff/laundry service available. The last straw was when, having tickets for the Opera, we asked Reception to book a taxi for us with an hour in advance. The girl said that it was not necessary to book it that early, as 10 minutes was enough. Of course, the taxi she called was over 15 minutes late, so we started to get worried and went out to the street to get one ourselves. Guess what? When we are sitting inside the car, already running late and risking missing the show we had booked months in advance, she ran outside to the street, opened the door, and demanded us to get off the car immediately as \"she had already called a taxi for us and we could not cancel it\". We replied it was her own fault as she had evidently called it too late, but she was mad and demanded the taxi driver to stop. Just then the other taxi arrived, and we were forced to get in it. By the time we got there, we barely had time to get to our seats a minute before it started. We were so stressed and shocked that the whole evening was ruined. Oh, and did I mention that the transfer she booked for us to pick us from the airport was ALSO 20 minutes late? To sum up, the administration of the hotel is completely unreliable, so if you decide to stay there, be prepared to book all your services independently and deal with the insane girl at the front desk.

We were incredibly lucky to get room 55 with twin beds as I had requested - I draw the line at sharing a double with my mum! The views from 55 are really breathtaking - the tower is so much more impressive by night, and Les Invalides is equally stunning. We could even see Sacre Coeurs in the distance! Obviously not all the rooms can offer this view but it's only a 15 minute walk to get to the real thing and it's a lovely walk too. The location of the hotel is fantastic - metro stations close by and easy to walk to Musee Rodin, Les Invalides and of course to the Tower and River. We also walked to the D'Orsay and across to the Place de La Concorde. The staff at this hotel were brilliant. All spoke perfect English and were so helpful, planning metro routes and offering advice. We would recommend the dinner cruise on the Bateau Parisiennes - at 95 euros it wasn't cheap, but we were treated like royaly, the food was delicious and there was more wine than we could drink, along with great music and the breathtaking views of all the sights along the river. It was a spectacular end to our four day break, and my Mum loved every minute. We recommend the Thai restaurant adjacent to the hotel, and the Italian just round the corner. I can't imagine how anyone could be disappointed by this hotel, and although the view is a bonus, it's still worth visiting because of the lovely decor, comfort, friendly staff and fantastic location.

When we needed to place to stay during a spur-of-the-moment weekend trip to Paris, I defaulted to this hotel without really considering any other. Coincidentally, we got the same room, #21. While the rooms are indeed small, one must understand that one's in Paris, not Pittsburgh. It's one of the most visited (read: expensive) cities in the world. For the money we spent, I think we received great value. Here's why (and my more general comments apply to both visits): ALL of the staff were friendly, helpful, and thoughtful. The front desk staff, notably Eric, couldn't be nicer or more accommodating. When we arrived early, via the Thalys, he not only got us into an available room, but provided us with coffee, juice, and croissants to \"raise our energy level\". In the evening, he'd greet us and offer a glass of wine or an espresso. Our room, while small, was quite comfortable. We heard no street noise thru the window, and either no guest was inconsiderate or the rooms' soundproofing is excellent . Yes, as one reviewer mentioned, the room's decor was in need of an update; the hotel owner, however, is in the process of completely renovating the entire hotel. Evidently, the upper floors' rooms have been completed and the lower floors and lobby are next in line. The room and bathroom were very clean, as was the rest of the hotel. Beds were comfortable, even to a man with a bad back and arthritic hip, both of which were aggravated by walking the length and breadth of the city. I cannot comment on the breakfast (other than the snack we were offered). With so many wonderful bakeries, cafes, and markets nearby, why eat in the hotel? Additionally, the neighborhood in which the hotel is located is excellent. It's quiet, safe, and relatively non-touristy. The hotel is a short walk to the Metro, and to some of the most lovely streets, IMHO, in Paris. We've decided that it's become our Paris hotel.

Our first visit to Paris, we ummed and arred about buying a 2 day Paris pass before we went but ended up buying a museum pass from the hotel & the metro is much cheaper than London, I think we may have saved a fair bit of money this way.. For budding art critics and posh shoppers I'd recommend Madelaine - There is a Soutine exhibition there until March 08 and Fauchon (expensive foodie shop). If/ when I go again, I'd give the Pantheon a miss but the views from Sacre Cour & Notre Dame cannot be missed, if u can handle all those steps!

The bathroom was perfect, there was a separate toilet, which was good when there are 2 staying in the room, however a wash hand basin in the toilet room would have been useful. We had a view of the Eiffel Tower from the room, which was fabulous, especially when it sparkles for 10 minutes every hour on the hour.

The drinks in the mini bar were cheap compared to most hotels I have stayed in and compared to the prices in cafes and restaurants around the city. The metro station at Ecole Militaire is very close by, but we found the hotel was very well located for exploring on foot.

We got the bus from CDG airport to the Arc de Triumph (13 euros each) and with a half decent map we walked the rest of the way which took about 25mins and was very easy. On arrival at the hotel we were given our key to room 46, a superior room, and some local information, mini bar pricelist etc. The room was pleasantly decorated in lemon and blue with french windows that opened inward to reveal a fantastic view of the Eiffel Tower. The bathroom was spotles with a 3/4 bath and great shower. Good hairdryer too which is quite unusual for hotels. There was also a french window in the bathroom too. The double bed was very comfortable and the heating was very good too, which was a god send because on the sat and sun the weather was very very cold. There were some markings on the wallpaper particularly where the cases would go but overall the room was very clean and tidy and not too small either. Beer in Paris is very expensive. Bottles are 25cl and in the bars cost around \u00c2\u00a33.50gbp and around double for 50cl. Heineken seems to be the popular brand. The prices in the hotel mini bar were probably as cheap as u would find, 25cl bottle of Heineken being around \u00c2\u00a32 a bottle. We didnt eat breakfast in the hotel, We did try the breakfast at the Ecole Militere brasserie down the street which consisted of orange juice, large coffee, french bread and either fried egg with cold ham or scrambled eggs. The cost was around 8 euros. There are lots of cafes and restaurants around the area. We ate at the champ de mars which was very good. There is a great hot food stall, next to the carousel by the Eiffel tower. The hot dogs and fries are delicious. Paris is very easy to get around. All the streets are well signposted and you can literally walk anywhere, weather permitting. The ecole militere metro is a couple of minutes walk down the road if you want to take the tube. All in all we had a lovely time.

The room is small (remember you're in Europe), but it was enough space for my husband and I to cuddle in on a cold rainy week in romantic Paris! There are some good reveiws on here about what room to stay in to have an Eiffel Tower view. We tried to get the corner room on the top floor (floor 5), but it was booked, so we stayed in the room next door.

I'm sure there are other hotels with bigger rooms and a better veiw, but for a romantic view on a budget - this is well worth it.

We waited and waited - they were about 45 minutes late, and then had to pick up other guests at other hotels, and waited SO long (waited in the hot stuffy bus for about another 45 minutes) and then by the time we got to the airport, we were so sick we couldn't even think about getting on a plane for 9 hours! I think it would have been much better to drag the luggage to the metro and do it that way - that's the way we got from the airport to the hotel, so it's not too bad. You must eat at Cafe Panis!

Our room was adorable -- small (as most European hotel rooms are), and very tidy. We had hoped for a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower, and even though all rooms with this view had been booked solid for weeks, the staff managed to squeeze us in when someone else canceled. Our room had a spectacular view, encompassing the Tower as well as Basilique du Sacre Couer (and the Ecole Militaire, naturally, since the hotel is so close to this building). The (Ecole Militaire) Metro stop was two blocks away, and conveniently goes directly (no transfers) to stops near shopping at major department stores (les grand magasins) such as Printemps and Galleries Lafayette, as well as the Pont Neuf and the Louvre. The 7e neighborhood (where the hotel is based) is full of character as well as great sites to visit within easy walking distance (including parks, the Mus\u00c3\u00a9e Rodin, Mus\u00c3\u00a9e de l'Arm\u00c3\u00a9e, Napoleon's Tomb -- and the Eiffel Tower, of course). The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly! We really appreciated the room w/ view, as well as Metro directions, airport shuttle information, and all-around helpfulness. We did not eat the hotel breakfast, but chose to go to the local grocery store, butcher and bakers for food to stock up in our room's mini-fridge, which was quite cold (most hotel room fridges are inadequately cold to really keep food in). Restaurants in the area are pricey (cafes, too) -- even for Paris -- and I recommend saving some money and exploring the neighborhood by doing local shopping instead of eating out every meal. On a side note, it was truly unfortunate that the hotel was filled with obnoxious tourists. We ended our Western Europe vacation in Paris, and we certainly saw ignorant travelers from every culture (not just the stereotypical \"ugly Americans\"). However, the folks staying at this hotel tried our patience, even in passing in the halls. For example, one woman barged into a conversation I was having with the front desk person, inquiring loudly for a \"map in English.\" The staff person politely did not appear shocked at this ridiculous request, and provided a map from a wall display while explaining that they had maps, but the street names and monuments would be in French, not English. The woman completely missed how her request had been asinine, and continued to say in a condescending tone, \"Well, then I guess I'll have to learn to speak FRENCH then, now won't I?\" Well, yes, a passing attempt at conversational French would be nice when you visit France. So would some basic knowledge about travel, like the fact that maps do not translate street names from the original language into other languages to suit you. How would you find \"Pont Neuf\", if it were called \"New Bridge\" on the map??? Other than our fellow tourists, the hotel itself was delightful. Great location, clean room, helpful staff.

We just got back from our trip. We found this hotel on tripadvisor.com, and the experience was great. Amandine, Julie and Estelle (and their other team mates) were very helpful (and are still being helpful even though we have already checked out.. more on that later) As this was a wedding anniversary trip, we were very happy to stay at the Duquesne Eiffel.. we stayed in 2 different rooms, #54 and #35 and the view was super.. My birthday was on 8/31, and we were given #35, with the fabulous view of the sparkling eiffel tower, for our last night in Paris. What a super birthday present and way to end our trip to Europe! How many people can really say they had a view of the Eiffel tower? From my first email to our departure, the team at Duquesne Eiffel were very helpful, and thankfully communicated in English very easily (all I had was some junior high school french to rely on!) We stayed a total of 4 nights, and checked out to travel to Belgium for a few days in the middle of the week, and we were able to leave some of our luggage at the hotel, which helped us immensely to be able to travel easier on the trains to Brussels and Brugge, and back to Paris. The location of the hotel is by far the best, in terms of convenience to the metro stop (L'Ecole Militaire), Rue Cler, the Supermarche, as well as the Eiffel tower and museums like the Rodin, Musee D'Orsay and Invalides Militaire (Napoleon's tomb). The neighborhood was very safe as well and there were never any concerns about safety, even late at night. The rooms were very clean and neat. Thank you to the cleaning staff! Amandine also helped us book the \"Eiffel tower dinner/cruise on the Seine/show at the Lido\" which was the perfect combination of things to do while in Paris (not to mention a perfect birthday celebration!). That package encompassed 3 of the many things we wanted to do while in Paris. And I can't forget to mention that the hotel also helped by booking the YELLOW van to pick us up at CDG to bring us to the hotel. We received very clear directions on what we needed to do, once we landed in Paris, to ensure we met the driver (needed to pick up any phone and dial the toll free number BEFORE we went to baggage claim.. The man on the other end spoke english, who then told us what door to meet him at). I had been nervous about this procedure, as I couldn't understand how we would be able to make a call, without putting in any coins or using a telephone card, but it worked very easily. Last but not least, Estelle has been helping us contact Thalys, the high speed train to/from Brussels, to see if they found a print of Brugge we inadvertently left behind on the train, when we arrived back in Paris. Thalys hasn't been very responsive to her messages yet, but we are very appreciative of her efforts on our behalf. We are hoping for the best. We gave her our email address as we were checking out the following morning to head back to the States and she said she was going to keep trying to see if she can get some answers for us. This just shows us that the staff at Duquesne Eiffel are truly customer service - oriented. We highly recommend this hotel because of its location, and staff and cannot wait to stay again when we are visiting Paris (and hopefully it is sooner than a 20th wedding anniversary!)

Although the rooms are small and bijou they are clean, and the bathroom is lovely, very tiny but with bath, shower & loo, what more do you want. To lie in the bath with glass of champagne, looking out of french windows directly at the Eiffel tower is heaven! Mini bar prices very reasonable with good selection. Satellite TV was limited though - CNN or MTV, would be nice to have BBC news and maybe Sky 1 & Cartoon Network if you have kids travelling with you. We did not breakfast in the hotel, as we preferred to try the french pastries on the numerous cafes terraces nearby, but the breakfast room looked lovely. Lift access to all floors. The staff were good, they booked us a lovely dinner cruise which was wonderful, go with the hotels choice as it was the cheapest and we had a wonderful 3 course meal, but go for the 50 Euro option not the 69 euros with drinks included, as the drinks were 1 cocktail, 1 water and 1 coffee. We had 3 cocktails each for the difference in price structure. The hotel is in a lovely district, a short stroll from bars and restaurants & supermarkets. Very close to the military museum. Lovely street market a few blocks from hotel on a Sunday. The Ecole Militaire metro is 5 minutes walk and takes you all over Paris. I would advise anyone going for longer than a few days to get the Paris Pass online well before you go, we did this and it saved us a fortune, gives you access to 60 museums and attractions, a metro ticket for the duration of your stay and allows you to queue jump! A word of warning, if you hate crowds & are visiting Palace of Versailles, go early, it is heaving with tourists all being herded like cattle around the rooms! Also to get the best view of Paris, do the Tour Montparnesse, 38 seconds in the lift, takes you 56 floors to a bar and 360 degree panoramic views. Much less crowded than Eiffel with the bonus of watching the Eiffel's light show after dark on the hour. wait til after 10 pm though to miss crowds and see paris by night. For the very brave, walk the extra floor to the terrace and have an open air view! So, fab hotel, great staff, lovely room. Remember space is of a premium in Parisien hotels, so nowhere will be huge unless the cost is as huge as the rooms. I would highly recommend this hotel for value, area and views.

We paid out (a lot!) for the Premier Service but it was a really wonderful evening. Tips Hotel bar and mini-bar prices were a LOT cheaper than local bars and restaurants. If touring Paris by Metro be prepared to walk a lot - not many escalators and lots of steps and tunnels. Also, I wouldn't recommend the RER & Metro as a good way to get to your hotel from CDG unless you are travelling very light. If you book an airport transfer or similar make sure you book the time using the 24 hour clock - then your 5:45 pm pick up won't arrive at 5:45 am and provide an unexpected early wake up call!! Don't go to the Palais de Versailles on a Monday - it's closed! But if you do go make sure you take in the Domain du Marie-Antoinette - beautiful. And don't be afraid to hop on the 'Petit Train'. Those gardens are big! Finally, check how many Metro & RER trips you are going to make and where you are going to go. You need quite a few trips to make it worthwhile (although it's very convenient) and ensure that the regions covered are sufficient for your journey - it's a pain having to get of a train to buy another ticket for the last leg of your journey. Obvious but worth noting - you'll get the best out of Parisiennes if you at least try and speak a little French - most you'll come into contact with will speak English (except train station employees) but all seem to appreciate an attempt at thier native tongue.

We wondered if it was worth the trouble, since we didn't get in until late afternoon, and the weather was closing in. We took the Air France shuttle to the Gare Montparnasse, and rolled our luggage mostly downhill the mile or so to the Hotel Duquesne Eiffel. The shuttle gave us a wonderful view of the city, and passed some spectacular sights we would not have seen otherwise. We chose the hotel based on the reviews on this website. We were warmly greeted at the hotel and given Room 51, a \"superior\" room, as we had requested, with a view from the balcony of the Eiffel Tower. As stated by many, the European rooms are a bit smaller than standard U.S. rooms, and this one was no exception. The room was nicely appointed, clean and had a modern and roomy bath. The view from the balcony was wonderful.

We were getting chilly, so we started heading back toward the hotel across the Parc du Champs-de-Mars where we could look back and see the lights come on the ET. We passed the Ecole Militaire and dined at one of the restaurants recommended by travelers on this site: Le Terrasse. Although it was too cool to sit outside, we did plenty of people watching, with a Metro stop directly in front of the restaurant and lots of people on the streets and in the restaurant. Our waiter was wonderful, bringing us glasses of kir and snacks while we perused the menu. He gave us very lively appraisals of some of the items on the menu! The French onion soup was excellent. Although it was 11:30 on a Thursday night, we felt very safe walking back to the hotel, because the streets were as busy as they are at lunch time in the U.S.! In the morning we raced out to soak up some more atmosphere, enjoying a croissant and cafe at a small corner restaurant.

When I went downstairs, to ask to be moved to the room that they'd advertised, the clerk slammed things around, and informend me that yes, the room WAS a superior room. I just had to GO OUT ON MY BALCONY, and look way around to the right, and then I could see it. First, if you're at all afraid of heights, there's no way you're going out on that balcony. Second, you can't stay out there, it's far to narrow. The hotel staff was COMLETELY unconcerned that the romantic evening they'd advertised was in fact a lie. In fact, there are only 3 rooms in the hotel with a view of the tower out your window as they advertise, but many more than that with NO view of the tower out your window that they classify as SUPERIOR. So, if you think that you're going to get one of the good ones for certain just because you book a superior room, DON'T COUNT ON IT! You're really paying for a CHANCE that you get a room with a real view of the tower. Also, if you do stay at this hotel, the breakfast room is like an oven.

First of all, the location is ideal as it is close to the Ecole Militaire Metro (in the 7th arrondisement) with many wonderful cafes nearby for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Les Invalides (Napoleon's tomb) is practically a stone's throw away. The rooms themselves are quite spacious for a Paris hotel as I've stayed in places in Paris before that were slightly bigger than a kitchen drawer. The rooms look as if they've been recently renovated with marble/granite bathroom countertops that are nicely cleaned everyday. There is a good breakfast - I particulary appreciated the fresh fruit - and all the amenities one could expect in a hotel (i.e. soap, lotion, dryer, internet, etc). Above all, however, I must single out the staff who were all exceptional. Muhammed, Amandine, Estelle and the cleaning and wait staff were a delight to deal with and they went out of their way to be pleasant and helpful. (How Parisians get their reputation for being snotty, I'll never know, but I'm guessing it has as much to do with the visitor as with the way the French respond to certain attitudes). The cherry on the cake, of course, was the view of the Eiffel Tower from our rom with its glorious shimmering lights at night.

We ate breakfast at the hotel and found it worthwhile. If you don't have much time in Paris, and there is so much to see, eat a quick breakfast at the hotel. For me, I needed my morning coffee before we set out. If you need to experience a cafe, have coffee, hot chocolate, or a glass of wine later in the afternoon instead. Be sure to eat dinner at Carmine's (and italian restaurant in Paris). It's just beyond the Ecole Militaire metro stop. The food, the prices, the staff - it was all a wonderful experience. Walk to Mus. Rodin - buy your mulit-day museum pass there! It's a smaller museum = short line. You can bypass the huge lines at the Louvre, D'Orsay, most important, Versailles and at least 30 other museums around the city. The desk staff is as friendly as everyone has described in their reviews. Extremely helpful. They made our reservations for a fashion show (Gal. Lafayette on Friday afternoon or Printemps on Sunday and maybe Tuesdays, too). For an amazing shopping experience, walk (15-20 min) to Bon Marche. There's lots of little shops in that area. It feels more authentic than the other 2 giant stores (GL & AP) and the crowds along Blvd. Haussman. The Eiffel T is a 15 min walk. The hotel's location is great b/c you must get there early! It opens at 9:30. We left the hotel at 8:30, and had plenty of time to walk and take photos before we got in line. By 9:30 the line is sooo long. Take a short walk to Rue St. Domanique and Rue Cler to see the shops. From this hotel you can walk to Rue Pont de l'Alma (15-20 min). That's where you ride the Bateau Mouches. The basic ride (without dinner) is 9 euros. We rode at 6:20 (the times may change with the day). You'll get photos of the major buildings with a beautiful sunset. Later, the buildings are all lit up - so beautiful!! The whole ride is about 90 minutes. To return to the CDG airport, the ride at 9:15am was 51 euros and took less than an hour.

The weather was very nice during this time. Not too hot and not too cold. The hotel was the first one of three that we stayed at during our trip to France. It was our 10th wedding anniversary so I wanted a romantic hotel with a great location. The Duquesne Eiffel Hotel did not disappoint. When making my reservation I explained this was a special anniversary trip & I would like a room with a nice view of the Eiffel tower. The hotel delivered! The view was breathtaking and I was up late ever night enjoying the light show of the Eiffel Tower from our room. We had room 301. I had booked my reservation directly with the hotel (via email), they were very prompt in their responses and made me feel comfortable that my reservation would be in order when I arrived. The Hotel is close to Napoleon's tomb, The Military Academy, Rue Cler, walking distance to the Eiffel Tower (a 20 minute walk that is very pleasant during the day) and there are many close restaurants and small bakeries. All the restaurants that we went to were very good, and they spoke English if needed. There is even a grocery store about 4 blocks away, so you can stock up on snacks. Don't miss trying the Orange flavored Coke they sell there. The hotel staff was wonderful, everyone working there was polite and helpful. They were great at giving information and helping to make reservations. If you do not know French the staff spoke fluent English. I have often read about hotel rooms in Paris being small. So I was prepared for a small room, but to be honest I did not think this room was too small. It was exactly what I needed. I was in Paris to see Paris, not hang out in a hotel room. So it served our needs well. I think that people who stated the room was too small have never stayed in a hotel in New York City (now those rooms are small !!!!). The bathrooms was a nice size. The room was very clean and the maid service was prompt & complete. We did have breakfast there when we arrived. I found it expensive for what we received. It was nice to have to there on the grounds, but you will find bakeries just a few blocks away for a better price. I would recommend this hotel to other travelers. Some notes about the area & traveling: RUE CLER: If going to the Rue Cler I would go by this schedule: The market is at its best Tue-Sat 8:30-13:00 or 17:00-19:00, Sun 8:30-12:00, dead on Mon. Which I found on this site: http://www.ricksteves.com/plan/destinations/france/ruecler0208.htm. I also had to put my French into high gear when eating at a restaurant on the Rue Cler. The staff did not speak English and I did not know how to ask for my leftovers to go. BATEAUX PARISIENS We went on an evening dinner boat cruise with Bateaux Parisiens. http://www.bateauxparisiens.com/ It was a bit expensive but worth it, the meal was delicious and the atmosphere was lovely. We sat by the boat's side window, I think if you were stuck in the middle of the boat you might not have had such a great view. The tour is priced according to where you sit on the boat. The band played a nice variety of music, so I think all age groups would like something they played. We walked back to the Duquesne Eiffel Hotel after dinner. (A 20 minute walk) I must admit not being too familiar with the area I was a little nervous about the walk back. I would not recommend the walk back for senior citizens, there were also no taxis in that area at night. Perhaps the Bateaux Parisiens would call for a taxi if you ask. We did get to see many teenagers \"mooning\" the boat as we traveled down the Seine. It must be a ritual. So have your cameras ready ;-) The monuments were lit up and were beautiful to see from the boat. We did dress up for this dinner, but we noticed many people were not too dressed up, it varied. I wish I had known we did not need a suit and dress or I would have been able to pack lighter. They also have a lunch tour. VAN SERVICE: When booking a room at the Duquesne Eiffel Hotel we were given the name of a van service that we could reserve to pick us up at the airport and take us to the hotel. I would NOT recommend this service. First when reserving it they tell you to call them as soon as you get off the plane, not to pick up your luggage first. I followed there instructions, and called them upon arrival. The man said hurry up and get outside the van is getting ready to leave. Since we did not get out luggage yet it took a few minutes, then we had to get to the location were he told us to go. This location was not easy to get to. It look us 20 minutes just to get on an elevator to get to the street level. We then found the van, and the driver acted like he didn't know we were coming, he was very rude and ignored us when we asked him questions (and we asked in French). After leaving us stand there for 10 minutes while he talked on the phone he said to get in the van & he would take us, like he was doing us a favor. It was not a very friendly welcome to France. Thankfully the rest of our trip was not like the arrival. TAXI RESERVATION: When leaving the Duquesne Eiffel Hotel we were heading for the train station, so we needed a taxi. Apparently taxis are very hard to get especially during rush hour. I was booking the taxi a day in advance and I was still not sure if I would get one. The woman at the Duquesne Eiffel Hotel desk was very helpful at getting me the taxi.

We wanted a good quality, three star hotel in a good location, but most hotels seemed either very expensive (in most cases overpriced, I'm sure) or just poor in quality. Because we were quite late with our booking as well, finding a good one (I was very careful to read reviews on all possible places) seemed pretty much impossible-- that is until my boyfriend stumbled upon Duquesne Eiffel. We both had a good feeling about the place, based on reviews in particular, and we were definitely not disappointed! First of all, the LOCATION IS GREAT. I cannot emphasize this enough. It is close to the Eiffel Tower and a stone's throw away from Napoleon's tomb (hotel des Invalides) right next to the military academy. 5 minutes away is the metro station and along the way a wonderful little bakery and a couple of restaurants. While it is so close to two of the main tourist attractions in Paris, its still a very quiet, nice and safe area. With the metro you can get anywhere in within minutes and even walking to the Louvre is possible! As we arrived we were greeted by a polite young receptionist and she quickly confirmed out booking, filled in the paperwork and gave us our key. The room was on the third floor (there's only 5, its very cosy and nice, clean and charming) and we were absolutely thrilled when we got in, saw the room and especially our view! Now, the room was small, but for a weekend trip this shouldnt be a problem unless you are fussy about space. It was nicely decorated (blue and yellow), everything was good quality and clean and the overall feeling was very charming and French! The bathroom was a very positive surprise because it had a big window and a bathtub, all very modern and tastefully done (nice bathtub and new showerhead). And now to the view- from both windows (room and bathroom) we had a view of the Eiffel Tower! This, I imagine even in Paris, is by no means standard and I'm sure many people pay a lot more than we did to have it! It was so gorgeous at night (although the cynical Parisians apparently disagree ;) and an incredible perk for an already positive experience. We stayed for 3 days and have no complaints at all. We didnt have the breakfast though (which seems expensive-- its much nicer to go to a local bakery, I think), but all and all service was excellent (cleaning and receptionists) and our check-out was very quick and professionally handled. We both loved Paris and a big part of this was thanks to our very positive experience at the Duquesne.

I stayed at the Duquesne because of the positive reviews and was not disappointed. I booked a superior room, which turned out to be on the top (5th) floor. It had a small balcony and a view of the Eiffel Tower. The room was small but typical for a Paris hotel. Quiet, clean and well appointed and with a well-equipped bathroom. The price was Euro 145 a night. Continental breakfast plus scrambled eggs and bacon was an additional Euro 11. The staff was friendly and helpful and all spoke English very well. The Duquesne is in a pleasant neighborhood, a five-minute walk from the Metro (Ecole Militaire). I was a little concerned that the location would be too far from the middle of the downtown area, but if you like walking (and if the weather's good), you can get pretty much everywhere on foot without too much trouble. It's about 20 minutes to walk to the Eiffel Tower, maybe 40-45 minutes to the Ile de la Cit\u00c3\u00a9, Notre Dame, Louvre, etc. Otherwise, a Metro pass will be money well spent as the subway in Paris will get you absolutely everywhere and the trains run every 4-5 minutes, if not even more frequently.

We booked the Duquesne Eiffel Hotel as it had such good reviews on trip advisors and as it was our first visit to Paris we thought it was a safe bet. Unfortunately this hotel was the only downfall of the weekend. When we arrived to book in we were told that a \"regular customer\" had decided to stay an extra night and that they had no room for us even though we had booked on line months before our trip. The hotel found us a room in a nearby hotel which we stayed in for our first night of the trip but then the next morning we had to check out of this hotel and head back to the Duquesne Eiffel hotel to check in, not an ideal situation. Another couple staying in the hotel the same weekend had a similar problem, they had a room but it was not the room they had booked. The hotel itself is quite nice, the staff are very friendly, the rooms are nice and the location is good too. When checking out of the hotel I paid by credit card, I then noticed a week later that the hotel had taken a further payment from my credit card, they never contacted me to say they were making a further deduction or give an explanation for the deduction. I'm currently waiting for them to come back to me on this!

The desk clerks made reservations for dinner and had some good recommendations. They were most helpful in obtaining train schedules for the balance of our journey. The hotel is showing a few signs of age such as scuff marks on the walls in the hall, but our room was updated. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

They were extremely friendly and helpful. We had a few hiccups during our stay which they smoothed out with a smile as quickly as possible. (Some issues with the room key, and also our reservation was mistakenly taken down for one night rather than two.) They were also helpful with restaurant reservations, metro directions, etc. We stayed in two 'superior' rooms at 180 euro per night. The first was pretty basic but acceptable - certainly nothing overtly super about it - clean to a reasonable standard but not to, say, 5 star standard. There were some scuff marks on the walls, slight peeling, etc, but the room did appear to have recieved care, just to be a little bit aging. The second was room 56, with a little balcony and a stunning view of the Eiffel Tower from the desk and from the bed. This room was much preferred! I'd ask for it by number if I stayed here again. The rooms are average European hotel sized, which Americans will find relatively small. This being Paris, you won't spend time in the room anyway. For our purposes, the location left a bit to be desired - however, we are a bit of a party couple in our late 20s and we like to be able to walk to nightlife. On the other hand, it's a 5 minute walk to the Metro and the hotel is in a lovely, quiet neighborhood. It was also quite easy to take a taxi back to the hotel provided one can remember how to say '23 Ave Duquesne' in French at the end of a night out! If I were looking for a peaceful relatively inexpensive hotel in Paris I'd definitely stay here again. I'd send my parents here, for example. But next time we come we will probably try to stay somewhere with a bit more street life. PS - I'd have to say the Rue Cler is our least favorite place in Paris by a wide margin. It's full of tourists from Ohio talking loudly in English and generally being annoying.

We made a right decision. We stayed in two different rooms: Room #25 for the first 4 nights, and in Room #56 for another 2 nights after coming back from our overnight trip to MSM/ San Malo. Both chambles were worth the rate -- cleaned everyday, hot nice shower always. Room #25 (on the second floor): Only the top 1/3 of the Tower Eiffel was seen, but the room was quite spacious for Paris standard -- two opened suites cases, no problem. Shower w/ bathtub, separate bathroom. Room #56 (on the top floor): Marvelous view of the Tower Eiffel through the window/ from the balcony, especially when lighted up at night. It even twinkled every hour, at 9, 10 11 and 12 midnight, which perfectly highlighted our stay in Paris. Though the room and bed were rather small, we fitted OK, but may not be such a recommendation for larger people. Shower w/ bathtub, bathroom in the same room. Service: All the staffs were always so pleasant. People at the reception spoke very good English and helped us finding our way getting around Paris, they were always quite busy helping out people. We also liked breakfast in our room, nice caf\u00c3\u00a9 and kind ladies who brought the plate with nice smile. Food (dinner): Our No.1 recommendation is 7 me Sud, 10 minutes from the hotel, on the Mont Piquet Ave, always packed with locals and tourists. Try their 20 euros course menu. I had Foie Gras as entr\u00c3\u00a9e, Dug Fillet as main plate, and candied pear w/ vanilla ice cream as dessert. The best a la carte was Escargot (in Takoyaki plate). Had two red wine (full-size bottle), and it was 85 euros.

Hotels recommended by friends were booked, but the Dusquene Eiffel was available. The great Trip Advisor reviews clinched it. The only room type available online was the comfort double, but the attentive staff responded with the offer of an upgrade to a superior room. Based on reviews, I chanced requesting Room 55, and it was available for four of the five nights we wanted. The fifth night was in room 25. The room and the hotel were wonderful. All rooms ending in 5 are corner rooms with views of the Eiffel Tower through french doors. Room 55 at the top of the hotel has the best view and a two-sided balcony from which you also can see Sacre Coeur and Les Invalides. The star attraction, of course, is the Eiffel Tower. At night, it sparkles in your window on the hour with the lights installed for the Millennium celebration. Magical, and surely one of the best views in all of Paris. Room 56 next door is smaller but also has direct views of the Tower from the bed. It would be nice if the hotel would put flower boxes and a couple of small chairs and a little table on the balcony. That would make it perfection. The hotel staff is everything the reviews say and more. They are knowledgeable, friendly, helpful and cheerful and will gladly suggest and make reservations at restaurants and even provide a computer-generated map to them. Even though we had been to Paris before, we really appreciated the advice of the staff. Special kudos to Amanda and Pritti. As others have said, Rue Cler is just a couple of blocks away behind the Ecole Militare Metro stop. This is a great place for coffee and a pain du chocolat in the morning though your table mates may be Americans armed with Rick Steve's Paris guide. There are wonderful cheese and chocolate shops and a nice patisserie. At the Ecole Militare Metro stop there is a small supermarket with a good selection of wine, fruit and staples. Use the Metro and invest in the Paris Visite pass, which is good for one to five days of unlimited public transit rides and discounts to some museums and attractions. Buy them at the Metro stations. We like mussels and went to one of the many Lyon de Bruxelles restaurants. It's a chain, but if moules are your passion, they are good and reasonably priced here. The nicest restaurant experience of the trip was at Fermette Marbeuf (5 Avenue Marbeuf). Its domed ceiling and tile work were enchanting and the food was superb. There's a 30 Euro fixed-price menu that is well worth selecting. We embellished it a bit, added wine and coffee and the tab was only 101 Euro, service included, for a special night of elegant service and wonderful cuisine. All in all, a lovely time at a lovely hotel with a lovely staff and a lovely view. A few reviewers seemed disenchanted with their rooms, but they seemed unused to the size of European hotel rooms and the prevalence of glass half-doors on showers. True, some of the rooms at Dusquene Eiffel are small and more basic, but if you can plan a little request room 55 or any of the corner rooms ending in 5.
