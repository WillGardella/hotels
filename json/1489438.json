The extra space was very welcome, as was the kitchen, laundry and Jacuzzi! We stayed on points and booked it the full 11 months out to make sure we would get the view and unit we wanted. We were at the far end of Magic Kingdom View and really pointed at the Contemporary but it proved to be still great for watching the fireworks. The kids loved seeing the monorails running back and forth, especially at night when it looked almost like a model train. We were hoping for an early check in but it ended up being only minutes till 4. Bell services had, without asking, put one of our grocery bags int he fridge saving us from spoiled food. That was a very welcome surprise. Bay lake tower itself is quite upscale. I personally like the decor, but I can see how others think it is not very family-friendly or very disney. Since the tower does not have much itself we spent a lot of time at the Contemporary. The pool and waterslide is good but lack much shade and is light on theming. The DVC only lounge at the top of the building came off very cold and uninviting. The best part by far is the proximity to the Magic Kingdom. It is no nice to avoid the crowds after the Main Street Electrical parade and make it back to our room to see Wishes. It is also very handy to grab a monorail ride to Epcot or one of the other resorts on the loop. I do wish there was a kids club somewhere in the Contemporary rather than going to the Poly or Grand Flo. Overall BLT is quite good, but could be better. You don't really feel 'transported' the way you do at other resorts, and it could have more for the kids.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spring Lake, NJ", "Title": "\u201cLocation!\u201d", "Author": "IIMFD", "ReviewID": "UR126804101", "Content": "A short walk to and from the Magic Kingdom makes this place.

We had a studio lake view on the fifth floor. We faced the Comtemporary and we were on the same floor as the skyway bridge. It was a fantastic location. My 2 year old could see so much from the balcony: the boats coming and going from the docks at the Contemporary, the flags on top of the Wilderness Lodge, the monorail going into and coming out of the Comtemporary, fireworks from Epcot, the nightly boat parade, the evening movie on the big screen down on the lawn, and the fire pit where people were roasting marshmallows provided by cast members. The room was great for our small family, but if we were staying longer than a long weekend we might want to upgrade to a one bedroom. Just because we have so much baby stuff and we had to use every inch of space. I really appreciated the extra vanity area in the kitchen hallway with the full length mirror. Both of my girls loved the fountain area by the pool for playing, but be warned the pool can get packed in the afternoon and there were a lot of seat savers and towels spread out on chairs that seemed to never have a person occupying them. Luckily it drizzled for about five minutes and about half the people cleared out and we finally had a place to sit. During this trip we went to Magic Kimdgdom and Epcot and never used our car. We walked to Magic Kimgdom twice, it took all of 10 minutes and that's with a 2 year old and a stroller. We also took the monorail to the Polynesian twice to eat. Just have to say the guys directing traffic/bell services/valet that work in front of the Contemporary all seem to be so good at their job, they have a lot of cars and buses to deal with but they do such a great job of managing everyone and still being polite.

We chose the bay lake tower because it is so close to the magic kingdom and we have young kids. This was a perfect place to stay. It has a great pool, and is located right by the magic kingdom. In fact, we didn't event take the monorail since it was only about a 5-8 min walk. Presently, the monorail is out of service from 11-5 daily so be mindful if your trip is coming up soon. Was not an issue for us really since we were so close. They are using buses for travel to and from the parks during the day. The bay lake tower is connected to the Contemporary hotel via a bridge. It's a very quick walk and the bridge leaves you right onto the 4th floor where the restaurants and stores are. So it's very convenient. The villas have a full kitchen, washer and dryer, two nice full bathrooms, balcony, pull out queen sofa bed and a chair and a half pull out bed. We had 3 adults and 3 kids and had plenty of room. We stayed in a 1 BR villa which has all of these things and i'd recommend this. My kids eat a bagel or pop tart or pancake for breakfast so I was glad there was a small market in the contemporary which sold all the staples you need for making quick meals in the room. So we avoided the crowds and overpriced breakfasts and ate in the room in the morning. Great pool with two slides, one very small, and one large. They provide very high quality life guards and also have kid's life vests available. There is a small place to grab snacks and drinks by the pool. Great pool!

The location was perfect for walking to Magic Kingdom and taking the monorail to Epcot. The rooms were well-appointed (except for a lack of additional pillows and blankets in the room for those of us sleeping on the sofa bed and sofa chair), and the service was good. My only complaint is that, after returning to our room around 9-ish after a long day at the parks, all we wanted to do was fall into bed; however, our room faced Bay Lake, where there is a nightly light show at about 10:15 pm that is accompanied by ridiculously loud electronic music. On our first night, we jumped out of bed when the music started playing, thinking that someone in a nearby room was blasting his TV, until I looked outside and saw the parade of brightly lit 2-dimensional animals passing by on the lake. So for our remaining 4 nights, we knew there was no point in trying to go to bed until after the light show was over. If you're routinely up until 10:30, this is obviously no problem, but for a group that included young children, this was a bit annoying. It would be great if they could at least turn down the volume of the music. Some friends of ours had a room in which their view of the light parade was obstructed, so they had the even more unfortunate situation of being subjected to the music without being able to see the show. So in summary, it's a great place to stay unless you like to go to bed early.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cHappiest place on earth!\u201d", "Author": "realreviewFlorida", "ReviewID": "UR126359059", "Content": "Bay lake tower is very clean and has outstanding service.

When I booked I was told no \"deluxe views were available\" I inquired as to what that was and was told I could face a parking lot or less than favorable view. I was standing on that property at the time I booked and didn't see anything horrid...so I grabbed the standard Studio for 3 nights in March, 2012. Arriving at the hotel we had to check in at the main property. I refused the 1st floor room and offered to spend more points for a room on a higher floor. They would not be forthcoming on what the criteria was for a standard vs deluxe studio room. They refused to book a room on another floor using my DVC points and begrudgingly offered to move me to a room the next day. We regretted the room the minute we moved in. Once the room was assigned we found it was ground floor with no barricade from the rest of the world. NO sheers on the glass doors left you in a fishbowl as we were next to the marina. Steady traffic paced by our door and our only alternative was closing the blackout drapes and it was cave-like. No workout facility here (walk to main building 3rd floor) No beverages or food (walk to 4th floor main building) If the s.f. is the same as other DVC Studios the layout does it no justice. DARKNESS was everywhere and it seemed like we were in a submarine. Except in the Tower common areas - no blinds left you to stand in the blinding GLARE of unobstructed sunlight when we waited at the elevators. Poor layout at the bathroom sink left little visible storage for daily toiletries. I'm 5'7\" and weigh 180 and the tub was tight for me....The kitchen was a one person area, although not as badly planned as the bathroom (NO EXHAUST FAN!). After our day at the park I walked to the main building (LOTS OF WALKING HERE) and explained my aversion to 1st floor hotel rooms - she/Mgr. explained what the previous desk man didn't, that floors 1-5 were standard and 6-16 were deluxe. They were giving a room on the higher floor because it had not been explained at booking....although the desk man never told the mgr. I had offered to \"pay\" for the deluxe room with my points. They acted like they were accommodating me greatly by not accepting my points...just a weird vibe. The bell staff picked up our bags the next morning and held them until we returned the next day at 4....the bookkeeping got jabberwokeyed and we had to comb thru our account because of charges that appeared mis-posted. This was not a pleasant time. I figured the 6th floor room might be \"nicer\" than the first floor it was exactly the same less some toiletries that we had been given the first day. (Body lotion and aftersun lotion). The private club was an outpost of a sort.... a DVC member walks to the center of the Tower and needs to show their room key and DVC member card - then the Clerk walks you 100 feet to the elevator and keys it to be able to get to the 16th floor. No draft beer.....just mixed drinks and wine and bottled beer, very few appetizers for food available. The bartender was bored and easily chatted about how SLOW the place was. It is a perc for DVC members to have this \"exclusivity\" but there is no break on prices or servings, we aren't being given anything you can't get elsewhere else on property. The most people I saw was one night at fireworks perhaps 9 people were there in about 3 groups. The laundry facilities are for guests of the DVC property - 3 large washers and 6 dryers. Nice because the studio has no washer/dryer as the 1, 2 and 3 BR. I will NEVER book another room here..... the room was smaller than any DVC studio I had ever stayed in and the staff was non-existent The Resort Monorail was down from 11:30am-6pm .so we were faced with bus rides that stopped at 3 other resorts before our destination (Going out and coming home we were always the last property - how did that work????)

First off, October would be a great time to visit due to fewer crowds, slightler cooler weather (at least not steamy) and if you're interested the Food and Wine Festival is at Epcot during this time. However be warned that if you're bringing very small children the food and wine festival may not be the best option as it is very crowded and there are swarms of people drinking and in some cases being obnoxious. We went and left after a couple of hours. Also, Mickey's Not so Scary Halloween party is happening so even if you don't attend you get the benefit of an awesome fireworks show from your balcony, though if at the MK that day you'll have to leave early for the party (if I recall correctly around 7pm). Our children were 22months and 3 at the time and we still felt they were too young for the halloween party so I could't offer much advice/information about that, but I will say the fireworks are quite amazing. As for the hotel, you cannot beat its location. Just a short 10min walk to the Magic Kingdom, another short walk to the monorail to Epcot, The Grand Floridian, etc. For extended stays its wonderful to have washer and dryer as well as a fully stocked kitchen. Regarding this, many folks recommend Green Grocer. I don't have experience with this as we live 1 1/2 away from Disney and brought our own food, but I will say that there is a Goodings (I think) grocery store a short 10-15 min drive away in the Crossroads shopping center where we went to pick up a few items to replenish near the end of our stay. It's also worth adding that there are a myriad of dining options outside of the resort, including at this shopping center. We had dinner at Fudruckers that night and they had a balloon artist twisiting some of the best balloons I had ever seen, and it was a week night. A real kid pleasing place to eat. The room was clean, bed comfortable. I loved the modern decor. We had a one bedroom, which seems to only be in the form of baylake view as opposed to the option of park view. Nonetheless we had a perfect view of the freworks from our balcony and windows. AMAZING. As non disney vacation club members we did not have access to the rooftop for fire works viewing, but not knowing this was a requirement during our first stay we did go up and were not asked to leave. It was nice because you have the benefit of hearing the commentary and music that goes along with the show, but watching form the room was every bit as nice. We used the play-yard for your 22month old to sleep in; just made some adjustments to make it more comfy for him. For our daughter we used and inflatable toddler bed, though the room comes with a pullout sofa and chair. We just had the thing from the previous year and brought it again. When we went in 2010 she was just 2 and we thought a pull out would have been too high for her and got the inflatable. It worked out great. We had PLENTY of room in the living room for both kids. If we go again next year, she'll get a pull out and my son will get the inflatable bed. The pool area was sufficient. No major bells and whistles but there was a kiddie slide for the toddlers and a larger slide for older kids. there is also a non pool/splash area for toddlers as well. There was entertainment in the form of music or a cast member heading poolside activities/games. There are poolside refreshments. House keeping was perfect; serviced the room daily with no issues or problems. During this trip we attending character dining at: Crystal palace for lunch 1900 Park Fare for breakfast Cinderella's Royal Table for lunch. We also had a local Macaroni Grill deliver food for 11 people (we were celebrating a 60th birthday for Grandma, who did not stay in the room with us but came to visit for a day) and I would highly recommend them. They did an awesome job; brought crayons and a paper table cloth like at the resaurant as well as absolutely everything you would need from serving utensils to parmesean, olive oil and herbs for bread dipping, butter, mints...I could go on. I could review the character dining but I think I'll do that in the restaurant section. In summary: Stay here! you can't go wrong! About the only \"con\" I would offer is that to get any service, ie front desk, etc you have to walk over to the contemporary, but this was either never an issue or if it were, I really wouldn't mind. Also when we checked in (early) we had a cooler full of food, and I was worried about leaving it at the front desk/food spoiling etc, but the time we were able to get into the room, but we were really lucky and our room was ready at checkin both times!

The rooms are spacious and full of amenities - e.g. DVD player, full kitchen, W/D. The bathroom w/large whirlpool tub and separate shower is delightful. The decor is clean and simple yet the furnishings are quite comfortable. The pool is great fun - second only to the Beach Club/Yacht Club's Stormalong Bay. There is a large waterslide for the big kids and also a small waterslide and sandy beach for younger ones. And of course there is a hot spa to warm you up afterward. There is a lounge on the top of the hotel that serves drinks and serves as a fireworks viewing platform for those staying at the Bay Lake without a view of the Magic Kingdom from their room (though if you and your family are feeling lazy, the elevator lobbies provide an excellent view of the fireworks as well). The dining at the Contemporary is varied and uniformly delicious (though it must be said, rather expensive). We love the California Grill and have visited it repeatedly over the years, but this trip we visited the Wave as well and were pleasantly surprised. Chef Mickey delivers quality a cut above it's buffet nature. And when you need a quick bite the Contempo Cafe does a fine job. But best of all is the location - you can walk to the Magic Kingdom and monorail to EPCOT...so most of your trip will be 'bus-free'. And because the Contemporary is uniquely part of both the MK's monorail and water taxi service you can easily and quickly get to all of the other MK resorts as well. Over the past few years Disney has decided to make their resorts destinations in their own right. So the easy trip by monorail or water taxi to all these resort restaurants (and perhaps more importantly with children, the quick ride home) helps make staying at the Bay Lake Tower a joy. I have only three 'warnings' and they are more quibbles than truly warnings. First, there really is no 'fast casual' dining option at the Contemporary because the restaurant targeted to that niche - 'Chef Mickey' - is LOVED by all. So book ahead or prepare to wait. Second, food in the lounge atop the Bay Lake tower seems to have been an afterthought - I think it comes from a kitchen they added in the basement. So avoid anything that needs to be cooked and enjoy the drinks and snacks. And third, if you face the lake (and this includes some of the rooms inside the horseshoe of the hotel) keep in mind that there will be a water show late in the evening.

But my oldest keeps getting older and she is such a dreamy kid, still (at 10) loves fairies and princesses and all things sparkly and magical, so it seemed time to take the plunge. As a Disney newbie my learning curve was steep -- I had no idea all the details it paid to consider! I spent hours planning and researching the trip and it was truly amazing. I chose Bay Lake Tower and it couldn't have been better. The location is perfect, especially with younger kids because it is so close to Magic Kingdom (I hadn't even really realized that Disney encompasses a whole bunch of parks) and is right on the monorail. The room was smallish but clean, up to date in terms of design and amenities, and it had a kitchen! (a frig, microwave and coffee maker) Somehow I didn't realize this when I booked it but the tower I guess is part of the vacation club so they have some really special perks. I definitely would have brought along fruit and other healthy snacks and food options if I'd realized. Also, upstairs is a special room for vacation club folks and the people at the Tower -- we never made it up but heard the view for fireworks was awesome! There are a bunch of really wonderful dining options at the Contemporary -- we loved The Wave and my husband enjoyed sitting at the bar at the California Grill... the kids and I were too tuckered out from walking a thousand miles a day (again -- had no idea how much walking you do, even when you stick to just Epcot and Magic Kingdom) to eat anywhere too schmancy, but he LOVED it. If you plan far enough ahead, I would make dinner reservations there early enough to see the fireworks over the castle... we only had a 6 or 8 week lead time and I discovered many reservations were impossible to get at kid-friendly times. At The Wave we liked sitting in the cool round blue rooms by the bar -- the kids loved the ambiance (kind of like being inside Jeannie's bottle!) and the food was really good with fairly diverse options -- LOVED the edamame with sweet chili sauce -- genius! Could also get great coffee in the Contemporary lobby each morning. I was a little overwhelmed by the faster service option, but by the end (a little late!) I was starting to get the hang of the meal plan and learning the ropes in the Contempo Cafe -- you really can find healthy options, and we really had a hard time using our meal plan points. For us that was a waste, though I imagine if we went back I'd have a much better handle on it. I would advise talking with the concierge or someone in the cafe right at the beginning if you're new to it the way I was. For example, I didn't realize I could stock up on water bottles and fresh fruit under the plan, and so on. Another lovely thing was the two pools to choose from -- both with snack bars, hot tubs and water features for the kids. They often had special things in the evenings for the kids as well -- movies under the stars, roasting marshmallows on the beach, trivia games and dance parties. One evening we took the boat, right from the Contemporary dock, over to the Wilderness Lodge for dinner -- again, for the children, another magical adventure. Even with the proximity to the Magic Kingdom, believe it or not my best advice would be to bring a stroller -- I ended up renting one every day for my two kids (6 & 10)... we used it a lot of the time just for holding stuff, but both kids rode in it a lot as well, and it gave me a good place to sit every now and again!

On my last trip a few months ago, I stayed at the Poly, which is also a \"Deluxe,\" and the rooms at the Poly can't hold a candle to the rooms at BLT. For example, the master bath has an oversized whirlpool tub and a rain shower, and the kitchen had granite counter tops -- the rooms at the Poly, by contrast, were basically standard hotel rooms with south Pacific decor.

The first trip was with an \"extended\" family in a 2-bedroom suite. There were five adults and one 3 year-old. We found the suite to be perfect for this group, with plenty of room. The rooms were very clean, and though we did observe some of the wear that others have commented on, overall we found it to be nicely furnished. And, the convenience to the Magic Kingdom could not be beat. This was offset though by the fact that aside from MK and Epcot, the other parks were a 15-25 minute bus ride away. Not a deal killer, but if you intend to spend time at Hollywood Studios or Animal Kingdom, do consider balancing the convenience. We also found the Contemporary to be nicely accessible, and the service to be particularly good. The contempo cafe is one of the best quick service restaurants available, and Chef Mickey's was good for breakfast the two times we visited. The second visit in the studio was with just my wife and son, The room was furnished in a similar way, we had missed the fact that there was no washer and dryer in the studios though so were somewhat disappointed by that. Again, it was comfortable, but I would caution that there is a kitchenette in the studio, the actual \"living\" area of the overall room is very tight for three people, particularly when the pullout is in use. We had a nice view overlooking the tennis courts/lake/MK. The room was not nearly as clean as on our first visit, with cobwebs in several places in the room, and dust on some surfaces. The sofa pillows were also badly stained and the bed furnishings were somewhat worn. The best part of the stay there is the convenience to the Magic Kingdom and the monorail line. If you have limited time at the resort, this comes in particularly handy since you aren't eating into your time on transport. I would say the drawbacks come from the contemporary furnishings, the distance from some of the services of the Contemporary and the lack of a Disney flair. Would I recommend a stay? Yes.

When we got over to BLT (you go across a bridge from the Contemporary Lobby - very fun!) it turned out we were only on the 4th floor. We had a good view of the castle, but the monorail line cut through it, and having just spent 11 nights at the Boardwalk wishing I'd changed rooms on check in (or at least asked) I thought I might as well give it a go here. I called down to reception and was told no problem, come back down and we'll get you changed over. Down in the Lobby we talked to a wonderful Cast Member called Mario who secured us a room on the 14th floor - as high as you can be!

We had the studio unit that had a queen bed and sofa bed, the only problem was if it was two couples the two were side by side not even two inches apart. For a family with 2 children this would be fine. The unit had a table and chairs and large mirror. The balcony was the best- with beautiful view of castle even though we did not have a resort view room. The mini kitchen was enough for us to make breakfast with microwave, refrig., coffee maker and toaster. It also had a vanity area across from the mini kitchen and a full length mirror in this section. It had a full bathtub/shower and sliding door for the bathroom. A full closet with door,safe,luggage stand, iron/board. There was room to store our luggage. The Tv and cabinet were modern, flat screen. We did not hear anyone in hallway,but could slightly hear the toilet flush in next room. The pool/ hot tub were nice- hot tub was perfect temperature, pool was cold in Dec. but contemporary pool next door was warm. There is a walkway between this hotel and Contemporary which brings you to the level in the Contemporary hotel with the most services. The monorail was easy to use but it goes to the other hotels first in the morning before the magic kingdom. But it is nice and close when you leave magic kingdom at night or for lunch. It is also close enough to walk to magic kingdom. Check in is located in the Contemporary hotel which is quite a walk. We did not eat at the hotel. We were also not able to book any dinner reservations for our favorite places- this was probably because disney was offering a free meal plan at the time of our trip-(we booked a few weeks before our trip).

Epcot is more reasonable so it would be nice to hang out there in the afternoons before walking back to the hotel.

This was my first time staying at Bay Lake Tower. First, the positives: Proximity to Magic Kingdom is wonderful, both for the ease of access to the park-just a quick walk across the street-and more significantly, the view of the fireworks from the roof top. Access to the variety of restaurants and services in the Contemporary Hotel, along with monorail service to Epcot. You can even see Spaceship Earth in the distance if you are staying on the left side of the resort with a lake view. Now, some of the negatives... When we arrived, our room was not ready. So we checked our bags and went into the park. When we returned to the resort, we stopped at bell services to have our bags sent to the room. Once we arrived in our room, SOMEONE else's bags were there. I called down to the front desk. I was informed the bags had been delivered by mistake and someone would be up to collect them. Well, they promptly sent someone to retrieve them, however, OUR bags got \"lost\"... After a few calls to bell services, I finally called the hotel manager, explained the situation and told him I wanted my bags found. The bags were delivered within 20 minutes of my conversation with him. The situation is even more interesting, coincidently because when checking into the Saratoga Springs Resort (where we stayed before transferring to Bay Lake Tower) the person next to me was complaining that when SHE got to her room, someone else's bags were there too!! I hope this isn't a trend with the \"Magical Express\"....Anyway, the rooms are a bit smaller than some of the other vacation club properties. The modern furniture is uncomfortable and not really conducive to lounging, in my opinion. The construction quality was somewhat disappointing, and unusual for a Disney resort. The top drawer in the kitchen was already broken. The cabinet door of the cabinet over the coffee maker scraped against the door molding each time it was opened. Sheet rock finish was sub-par as well. We happened to be there when there were bugs EVERYWHERE. They smelled like dead fish. While Disney did their best to vacuum them up as quickly as they could, the bugs prevented us from enjoying the balcony at night. They breed on/by the lake and are supposedly only around for a couple of weeks a few times a year. It was kind of cool to watch a few bats flying around eating them! Again, as the title said, I'm glad we stayed here once. However, we will stay at a different (more than likely Saratoga Springs) vacation club property on our annual trip next year.

Can't really comment on cost or value since I am vacation club member (if you go to Disney World or vacation at least 1 time per year, you really should look into vacation club as it does pay for itself many times over) Overall, we really liked the resort but if I were not a DVC member I would probably compare to rates at Contemporary before booking and if similar go with Contemporary instead since most amenities are at that resort anyway..", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cMagical Location\u201d", "Author": "kshark1958", "ReviewID": "UR120591876", "Content": "We stayed in an 8th floor lake view two bedroom villa with seven adults and one 7 year old child. We all felt very comfortable with two adults in the master bedroom( king size bed), three adults in the second bedroom (two queens) and two adults and the child using the sleeper sofa and fold out chair( single bed size) in the living room. Three bathrooms and plenty of drawer and closet space. It came with all the Disney resort home away from home amenities which are listed in the description of the unit and I don't need to get into here. We originally asked for a magic kingdom view they were booked so we got a bay lake view which I am glad for because except for watching the fireworks at night the bay lake I think is a better view, I attached a photo of our view. Also being a vacation club member It cost me less points. We did have some problems which is why I can't give a five rating but with each problem we had the staff worked their buts off to take care of the issue with good results. This building is next to the Contemporary and the Contemporary is where you have to checkin it is also where the stores are, the restaurants to eat, and the transportation to the parks. In Bay Lake you will find a small lobby with a matrai'd but nothing else. This was a small inconvenience but the Contemporary is a small walk away either from the first floor lobby or a walkway on the fifth floor.The feeling you get when walking through the hallways to get to your room is kind of weird because of that contemporary kind of decor but once you get to your room you will be very pleased. I guess the hallways don't have that warm and fuzzy feeling you get with other Disney resorts.The problems we had are as follows. Upon checkin we had issues with putting our park admissions on our room key but this was not the fault of the checkin clerk, when I ordered my park passes over the phone the girl on the other end of line did not attach them to our room. We wanted everything on our room key( park passes and meal plan) so we only had to carry around one card for each person so it took awhile to checkin. Our room was not ready ( 11:00am) so we went to eat lunch but our cards did not work so we had to have cards issued again. They did not deduct any meals from our meal plan because of this so they gave us a free lunch for the inconvenience. We then proceeded to spend the rest f the day in Magic Kingdom.You can walk to the Kingdom from here but when someone tels you its a five minute walk don't believe them it is more like fifteen minutes.We got a call at 4:00 which is checkin time that our room was ready but we stayed in the park till 8:00 then went right to our room. All of bags were there, we called down to the front desk for our grocery order from Garden Grocer ( different review) and they delivered that right away. The room had a great view of the lake and pool area and was very clean EXCEPT for when we pulled out the couch sleeper sofa their was a lot of crumbs and somewhat dirty sheets. We called the front desk and they sent someone up right away to correct the problem.The rest of the unit was spotless. Like I said before it wasn't perfect but the staff was very helpful when we had an issue. The only other problems we had with the unit was the living room TV had fuzzy lower channels and the washer stopped working, but the front desk made sure these were taken care of. The things we loved about this place. LOCATION, close to the Magic Kingdom walking or monorail.Nothing better then being able to walk back from Magic Kingdom when the park closes and the busstops and monorail platform is packed. Monorail to Epcot and buses ( every 20 minutes) to the other parks. The pool area was fabulous it also has a poolside bar. The staff were real friendly and helpful. The unit we stayed in was very spacious and had everything we needed it was also very quiet didn't hear anything through the walls. Their is also a viewing platform for fireworks and a bar ( kids allowed) on the top floor. Access to the top floor is suppose to be only accessible to vacation club members( Sorry but membership has its privileges) but the maitre d did not always check this. You need to go to the first floor so the maitre d can give you access to the top floor.Another side note about being a vacation club member, whenever I stayed at a time share resort I never had maid service everyday it was only once a week but since we were members we had maid service everyday, if you are renting you will not have this. Also even though you have to take a short walk next door to the Contemporary it has everything you need for gift shopping plus extras for your room,restaurants table service or counter service, arcade, coffee shop and pastries along with a very friendly and helpful staff. Would I stay here again? Absolutely, their were some issues but the staff took care of those and the pluses far outweighed the minuses.

We were amazed when we arrived at the Resort. A lady greeted us as we arrived and escorted us to check-in and gave the kids mickey stickers! We were all given 1st Visit and Birthday buttons. Then came the \"Key to the World\" key card...up to our suite ...WOW! Big , spacious and very clean...whatever airhead complained about their suite is sick! We had a 1 bdrm 2 full bath villa with a full very modern kitchen, eat at bar and balcony with a view of Bay Lake. We have stayed in nothing but the best..Venetian in Las Vegas, The Hotel at Mandalay Bay, Marriotts all over and had a butler suite when we went to Jamaica..Everyone at the resort is super friendly..its so unreal how they will go out of their way to make you happy..i never saw an unhappy face or i never heard them say \"i'm sorry or i dont know\". Disneys bus, boats and monorail (which ran straight thru our resort..yay) was great to..we never waited more the 4-6 minutes for them.

There are 3 adults - husband, 21 yo (6'4\") son and me. Hubby & I shared a comfy queen size bed and son survived the sofa bed ('not as bad as most' he said). Our room faced a quiet lakeside shore on the opposite side from the main Contemporary tower. From the balcony we could look to the left and had a great view of the fireworks at Magic Kingdom (for which we could also hear the music from our in-room t.v.). For our Disney Vacation Club points - the standard view is better than \"lake view\" as you usually have a good chance of side view of fireworks. The first time we stayed in a studio (when they first opened) I don't remember a separate sink area in the toilet and shower area - you had to use the wetbar area. However, that has been remedied and there is a nice sink in the same room with the toilet and shower/tub. The wetbar/kitchenette area is spacious and has great storage space. If it was just my husband and me, this room would be just fine for extended stay. However, with 3 adults (or probably anything more than 2 adults) it would probably not be very comfortable for more than a night or two. It was quite a hike over to the Contemporary resort which housed the restaurants, shopping, and monorail - but still better than driving to the other resorts on the monorail route. We only live an hour from the Mouse, but find our little one/two night 'getaways' for that hour drive are worth the expense of DVC membership. We can drive an hour and feel like we are a thousand miles from stresses of work and 'everyday.' We rarely ever go into the parks, but enjoy watching the faces of children and meeting families who are here for the first time. My main complaint about this resort is that there is no separate check-in for the Bay Lake Towers - all check in is done over at the Contemporary. It would be nice to be able to check-in in the same building in which our studio or villa is housed. We've also stayed in a one bedroom villa (about a year earlier) and loved the layout and wise use of space. We had 4 adults on that trip (husband, son, his friend, and me) and the separate bathroom for the guys was wonderful for this 'lone' woman on the trip.

The rooms with a view of the Magic Kingdom also have a view of the car park. The lake view also lets you see the electrical water parade from your balcony, so for me it's the best option.

We bought a set of points at BLT with reservations, not really loving the modern theme/decor. But staying here is a whole other ball of wax, that is, a whole different perspective. BLT is by far the best in my book. We usually take a studio to save more points for more stays on-site, and the BLT studio has the most storage, the most functionality of such storage. The t.v. unit consists of 6 drawers, and alongside the t.v. is another large cabinet with shelves, there is a large closet with ample hangers (the kind that you have at home, they are not \"attached\" to the clothes rod), and the kitchenette ... I should have so much storage at home! Next to the dorm-size fridge is 3 or 4 drawers (inside the top drawer is a silverware rack with said items, plus a corkscrew and can opener), and next to that is the under-sink cabinet. On the other side of the fridge is a ceiling-height pull-out pantry (similar to the ones you see at Ikea)! Above the sink is another cabinet, this one a horizontal unit with a \"garage-door\" type door, in which are the plates, glasses and mugs. This is all along one side-wall. The other side wall confused me - half of it is just some decorative panels, but beside that is another counter with a large well-lit mirror, and below that is several open shelves for more storage. The back wall of this food-prep space is covered with a large (full-length) mirror. The bathrooms are the smallest I've seen so far (we've stayed at AKL-JH & KV, as well as OKWR) and unfortunately do not offer the \"split\" in these other hotels (that is, where the commode has it's own \"room\") but is quite nice despite that. There is a shelf in the under-sink cabinet, and there is a set of shelves next to the sink that was sufficient for the two of us. The only time I'd think it would fall short is if you have teenage girls with you! Of course, if that were the situation, you might want to rethink staying only in a studio. I asked for a studio in an even-numbered room on the highest floor possible, and was rewarded with a great view of the Magic Kingdom. If you tune your in-room t.v. to channel 20, you can hear Wishes as it is played out over the castle, and watch it from your balcony! Almost nothing can top that in my opinion. The service, well it's Disney Customer Service, on a par with no other company. The value, excellent if you are Disney lovers. The beds are excellent, the cleanliness as well. The restaurants are all in the adjacent Contemporary, accessible either on the ground or by the skywalk, which connects the 5th floor of BLT with the 4th floor at the Contemporary (which is the floor where two of the restaurants and the 3 shops are located). Being able to just walk next door for food or for the monorail beats everything (save for watching and listening to Wishes! from my balcony!)! The restaurants are also on the Disney level of service. The California Grill on the rooftop affords a spectacular view of the Magic Kingdom and evening fireworks. If you're not dining during the fireworks but still wish to view them from there, you can save the receipt from your meal and be able to access their viewing deck to watch. The Wave, another fine-dining venue, is on the ground floor at the end of the registration and concierge desks. Chef Mickey's offers buffet and character meals, and the Contempo Cafe counter-service food (these are both on the 4th floor). The only negative thing about the Contemporary and BLT is the size of their elevators, they are a bit small; it was difficult when there was a stroller or scooter and 2 families as well.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shan3034", "Title": "\u201cModern look, minutes to Magic Kingdom\u201d", "Author": "Shan3034", "ReviewID": "UR119758850", "Content": "I loved this place.

We stayed at BLT for 3 nights/4 days before moving over to Beach Club Villas (BCV) for a week. While we were glad we stayed there, we were happy to transfer at the end of our BLT stay. The resort is new, which is always a plus. Check-in is at the Contemporary, not at the tower, which is consistent with other DVC resorts. The lobby decor is nice - a modern theme. The hallways are clean and curved, since the building is circular. In the hallways and elevators, you feel like you're in a high-rise apartment building in a city, so if you're looking for a vacation-like or homey feel, you won't get it here. The room was nice. We stayed in a studio, and one of the best things about it was the different layout than other DVC studios. Other studios have a microwave, refridgerator, etc. in the entrance hallway, whereas BLT has a separate galley kitchen with quite a bit of food storage space. We didn't have any food to store, but we liked that we could! Also, after member complaints of no sink in the bath, they moved it from the galley area (still has a kitchen sink) to the bath where it belongs. An extra counter with a mirror in the kitchen gives another place for hair/makeup in the AM, although if we were using the kitchen, I'm not sure that's a sanitary option. The bathroom had the two most negative complaints of the unit. It was clean and appointed as any other bath, except a) it lacked hooks to hang towels and other items; it only had shelves, which you don't want to put wet handtowels and facecloths there, and b) the tile floor was the most slippery surface I have ever encountered in my life, including ice skates on a freshly Zamboni-ed rink! We had to remember to hold onto things as we walked in there. If you fall it's small, so the risk of coming down on the tub, toilet, or sink is high. We found it really dangerous. My husband thought the bed and pillows were comfortable, and he's really picky about them. Despite our early request and confirmation of that request a couple weeks before of being on a high floor, we were only on the second. Disappointing, but we realize requests aren't guaranteed. So although the view off of our balcony wasn't high, we overlooked other parts of the resort, beach area, and marina - not bad. We went to the Top of the World lounge our first evening there, and although it was nice, we were disappointed with the VERY limited food options and the sizes of what we did order vs. what we paid. I would go again for drinks but would make sure I ate first. Going out on the balcony to view the fireworks is nice, and although it was a Friday night and one that a Halloween party was going on at the Magic Kingdom (MK) - meaning less people were at the park since it was a special ticketed event, thus more people could've been at the resort - it wasn't crowded on the roof deck. It's a bit of a pain to get up to the lounge since you have to go to the first floor lobby to be let up by the concierge. OK, I guess that's one bonus to only being on the second floor. The pool area was fine; nothing all that special - a small waterslide and the pool is a decent size. The bar has some limited food that is convenient, and the food court isn't far at the Contemporary (or for a fee they will bring an order to you). As a runner, outdoor options are limited if you want variety. The path around the resort is short, so it's easy to get bored if you want to run more than a couple miles. For one stretch, I tried running out to MK and past it as far as you can go. It was getting congested with park guests, so I'd only recommend that if you run early before the park opens. The theming of all other WDW resorts (except for Pop Century) is based on places - e.g., New Orleans (POFQ, POR), Africa (AKL, AKV), New Jersey Shore (BW, BWV), Cape Cod (BC, BCV), the Northwest (WL, VWL), etc., wherewas BLT and the Contemporary are based on a time period - and one that only exists for awhile (the future) until you reach it, then it's outdated. Because of that, I think the little theming touches of other resorts are missing here, which is something most WDW guests enjoy. Being walking distance to MK was definitely nice - no bus, boat, or monorail needed. Since we don't have children, we'll would probably only stay here for a couple nights for the MK advantage, then move over to the Epcot area where we spend more time and like those resorts (Boadwalk, Beach Club, and Yacht Club) much better.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort!\u201d", "Author": "the-z-family", "ReviewID": "UR119395333", "Content": "We are DVC members and this was my first stay at Bay Lake Tower. I was prepared to not like it very much after I had read many reviews on another site from unhappy DVC members who did not care for it. I was totally blown away. We had a studio - I loved the decor and the set up of the studio. Loved that the kitchenette has it own seperate area - we treated this as a bar area since we were there for a girls weekend for Food & Wine festival and made good use of it! As others have mentioned, the tile on the floors of the bathroom are super slick. They're pretty but dangerous, especially when wet. I can't imagine that people haven't taken a fall on them, a lot. The same tile was used in the bathroom by the pool. I also agree about the showerhead I saw on a few reviews, although I was ok with it because I didn't have to work hard to get shampoo out of my thick hair. I am guessing our room has been one of the ones that was changed because we did have a sink in the bathroom and ony one sink in the kithenette. Also, we had a huge full length mirror in the kitchenette area as well that took up the entire wall area at the end of the kitchenette. The bed was really comfy and I didn't mind the fact these studios were a tad smaller than the other DVC properties. The only thing I didn't care for was the bathroom door, as others have mentioned. There is basically no privacy. We did use the pool for an hour or two one afternoon and found it to be a bit small for the size of the resort. we had to walk aropund the pool a few times to find 2 chairs next to one another and we did find that the sun went behind the building at about 3pm. Didn't bother me but if I were looking to get a tan it would be an issue! The feel of the pool is a bit sterile compared to the other DVC properties. Kind of boring but again a non issue. One of the best features of this property is the top of the world lounge, This exceeded my expectations. We went up to check it out and were treated to Hallowishes, the fireworks show at Magic Kingdom for the Halloween party. The pipe the music in so its really cool. The lounge itself is very hip, although we did not have a drink there I plan to go back for snacks and drinks in the future. Loved it. Of course the 10 minute or less walk to Magic Kingdom is a plus as well. We took the monorial to Epcot for the festival and that was convenient as well.

Check in is at the Contemporary Resort. We were checked in very quickly and in our rooms with in 15 minutes of arriving at the resort. Room was clean with a view of Bay Lake and the Contemporary Resort. Decor was very modern with lots of stainless steel and dark brown tones. Bed was a queen size that was very comfortable. Bay Lake\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greatest asset is its location. All, and I mean ALL, services are at the Contemporary Resort. The 5th floor walkway between the hotels makes getting between them easy. It is a ten minute walk to the MK, and the monorail or busses can get you anywhere in WDW you want to go. Bay Lake has a few issues: 1. Bathroom floors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are very shiny and slick. Nearly killed myself stepping onto bath mat while getting out of shower. Wife had same issue. 2. Shower heads and water pressure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the shower head is not adjustable and the water pressure is so strong that it feels like needles hammering at your skin. If a child turned on the shower and got a water jet in the eye it could cause serious injury. You turn on the shower with a sliding lever that we discovered can control the pressure as well. There are no instructions about this in the bathroom. 3. Bathroom doors - I understand this is being addressed and will be changed, BUT, until then beware \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is a large gap left open when the door is closed. This allows others to see into the bathroom, specifically the shower area. May be a problem with kids. 4. No full length mirror anywhere in the room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c real problem for my wife. 5. Sink in the kitchen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c There is no sink in the bathroom; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the kitchen area. There are two sinks in the kitchen area, one for dishes and one for the bath.

You can walk over to the Magic Kingdom in less than 10 minutes, which we found to be the ultimate convenience. No need to wait in line for the monorail and visit the other 4 monorail stops to reach Magic Kingdom. And the castle view from our room was pretty neat, especially for our 5 year old who loves fireworks. The resort itself really isn't anything to write home about. The corridors are very sterile-looking. And beware - The shiny floor tiles at the entry door thresholds become VERY SLIPPERY when they are freshly cleaned. Several members of our family almost fell. The rooms are contemporary and over-designed, to the point of being impractical (for both guests and the maintenance team). While the sliding partitions that make up one wall of the master bathroom (in a one-bedroom villa) look cool, they don't block any sound coming out of the bathroom and actually allow some light to leak out in the middle of the night. If that light isn't enough to wake you up, the sliding doors with frosted glass inserts on the bathroom and toilet room are loud and flood the master bedroom with light. And these doors fall off! The door on our toilet room fell off its track on the second day of our trip (almost trapping my husband inside the toilet room! Just think if it would've been my 5 year old in there!) and wasn't fixed until the fourth day, despite calling maintenance immediately. The lighting at the bathroom sink is the WORST I've ever experienced in any hotel room. It was nearly impossible for my husband to shave at the sink, and putting on makeup became my daily challenge. I was worried about being mistaken for a cast member from The Haunted Mansion, since that's what I looked like in the bathroom mirror! And then there was the shower! We stayed in two different rooms on the 7th floor. In the first room, there was a wall mounted shower head and a ceiling mounted shower head, but not enough water pressure to power either one. After lathering up, I wasn't sure I could get the shampoo out of my hair! In the second room, the ceiling mounted shower head had been removed, and the water pressure was adequate, but barely. When we checked into our first room, the sink in the master bathroom was clogged, so I made my first call to maintenance within 10 minutes of checking in. And the room was dirty! There were visible dust bunnies on the shades of the wall-mounted lights and some long, black hairs that obviously weren't mine on the bathroom floor, trapped under my favorite sliding doors. YUCK! The pool was great for our 5 year old, but older kids would've gotten bored. And the pool is positioned so that it's completely shaded by the building in the afternoon! Who designed this place?!!!!

Our unit was nicely organized and we took all of our evening meals in our unit because it had a kitchen and dining area and this gave us more time to enjoy the resorts' pool, hot tub, etc. (You can have the resort pick up your food for you or go off-site and buy your own) The laundry room was a bonus with our large group and and each unit has a child's \"Pack and Play' crib. The resort is a contemporary styled resort that is both beautiful and comfortable. Our unit had 3 bathrooms, all with showers and 1 with a bathtub. Each bedroom had a deck and we viewed the lake, it was gorgeous! The Lake view will also give you a view of the Electric Light Parade on the lake which occurs each night about 10 pm-approximately 20 minutes after the fireworks display at Magic Kingdom. (If you face MK or the parking lot, go to the pool after the fireworks to watch this display on the lake) Viewing the lake will also give you viewing of para-sailing, boats on the lake and lots of huge birds. There was easy access to the viewing of the evening fireworks at Magic Kingdom, and it is my belief that this viewing is for the DVC members, but the viewing at the adjoining contemporary is just as good as BLT. (There is a connecting hall to the Contemporary Resort on the 5th floor.) We had heard that non-DVC members could go to the front desk and be escorted up to the 16th floor, but didn't confirm this.).The fireworks during our stay was both the \"Wishes\" display and the \"Micky's Not So Scary Halloween\" display and these displays are different and equally enjoyable. The pools at BLT was great, the hot tub nice, and the activities for the kids and family (movies, games, video rentals, boats to rent) are plentiful, there is always something to do after the parks close at this resort. Access to Magic Kingdom is a short walk away, the location is fantastic! It is a great location for those with young children who need a break from the parks to take naps, have a nice lunch, or just hang out in the pool for a few hours. We had a rental van and we were given a parking pass upon check in which admits you into the BLT parking. You will receive 'key cards' for the members of your party and will occasionally be asked to show this as your car enter the property at the gate. Our stay was a good one with the only hiccup being the floor near a closet became very wet.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in just about every kind of room they have to offer: value, moderate, and deluxe resorts, as well as studios, 2-bedroom, and 3-bedroom Vacation Club Villas, and I hope that this review offers a fair (by my opinion) assessment of Bay Lake Tower in comparison to what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve grown to know and love about Disney over the years. The room: We stayed in a studio at Bay Lake Tower for this trip. It had one queen sized bed, a bathroom with shower and toilet, and a kitchenette area (included plasticware and some dishes) that also contained the bathroom sink area (more on that in a minute). I LOVED the artwork, it was some of the best I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in a resort room, very eye-catching. I thought the bed was pretty comfortable. Being a studio, there was plenty of open-air storage space, which was nice since the closet space was a little lacking (although drawer space for clothes and food was pretty decent). The balcony was a good size and though we were on the side facing the pool, the view was nice (got to watch the sunrise!). I would say though, that if you can afford it, getting a view of Bay Lake Tower and the Magic Kingdom is the way to go at this resort. While the pool view was pretty nice, the way the building curves inward on the pool side made me feel very close to my neighbors when I sat on the balcony. One thing I hated in the room was the shower - it was so incredibly strong, it felt like 1000 needles cutting me, and there was no way to adjust it that we could find. I can imagine if you had even a small sunburn, it would be unbearable. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard that this is not the case with other showers in the same resort, although I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure why they would have different showers in different rooms. Also, the room did not have a full length mirror. There was a decent sized one in the living area, but to see full length, I had to stand on the ottoman, which is sort of annoying. Lastly, the layout of the studios at Bay Lake Tower is terrible (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s different from the 1, 2, and 3-bedroom villas, and even different from some other studio villas at other resorts). A Bay Lake Tower studio has a bathroom with just a shower and toilet, which is not unheard of \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Disney generally separates the sink area from the shower and toilet. This bathroom did not have a lock on it, which I thought was weird. However, the bathroom sink area is located in the kitchenette area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what the heck?? It was so cramped, and also kind of gross \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hairbrushes near my food? No thanks. There was plenty of counter space at the bathroom sink, but I would have preferred a larger mirror and two sinks - it was difficult for two people to get ready at once with only one sink, although it would probably be even more way too cramped with two. You should also keep in mind with any Vacation Club Villa you may stay in, that maid service only comes I think once every 4 days, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come every day. The pool: We went to the pool a few times. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little too small for the size of the resort, as we occasionally had trouble finding two chairs together, depending on the time of day. Otherwise, it was fine and we did enjoy our time there. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not overrun with children, although they do have activities with a DJ to keep the kids occupied, and they all seemed to be having a blast. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try the water slide or the bar (both looked pretty standard). The Top of the World Lounge: This was really great. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lounge that can only be enjoyed by Disney Vacation Club members, or if a member books your room for you. In chatting with the (wonderfully friendly!) bartender, I learned that it is in fact available to ALL Vacation Club members, but that many don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize they can come over to use it even if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t own or stay there (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard otherwise from some members, but I assume the bartender knows what she is talking about). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shame more people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use this area, because the bartenders are some of the best I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve run into on the Disney property, both in personality and ability to mix a great drink. The lounge was always very quiet and relaxed whenever we went up there, and there is a huge balcony area outside where you can enjoy the Magic Kingdom fireworks with music piped in to the speakers from the Magic Kingdom. The view is a little off-center, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really cool, plus you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to battle people inside the park to get a good spot! We ordered some appetizers, which were ok but not great. Food is definitely not the main draw for Bay Lake Tower. The resort itself: You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really beat the location, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122sa very easy walk to the Magic Kingdom from Bay Lake Tower, plus the Contemporary is connected via a footbridge, and with a 2 minute walk to the Contemporary, you have access to the monorail plus all the dining and shopping. There is no real dining or shopping at Bay Lake Tower, other than the bar at the pool. It actually doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even have its own check-in desk, you have to go to the Contemporary to check-in. Bay Lake Tower has a very small lobby with a greeter, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not bustling with the normal Disney hotel activity. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a huge deal, but it might be nice to have a snack bar or quick service restaurant in Bay Lake Tower, so that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to walk over to the Contemporary for just a cup of coffee in the morning. We waited a long time for buses (Bay Lake Tower and the Contemporary share a bus stop), although this is not the normal experience that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had the past 25 years or so visiting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c normally the buses are very good. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obvious that Disney has cut back in the tough economy, and surely there are fewer drivers and they are doing fewer routes that are much longer and less frequent. Overall, I think Bay Lake Tower is worthy of a 4 star rating because it really is a beautiful hotel with fabulous furniture, artwork, and lighting, plus you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find a better location to stay in. However, for me, it lacked a lot of the Disney theming that I enjoy about staying on property there. It had more of just a generic nice hotel feel, than a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Disney\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd feel that places like the Animal Kingdom Lodge or the Boardwalk Resort have. I probably wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend that much money to stay again, as I would probably prefer to stay at a moderate resort like Port Orleans that is heavier on the theming, since that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something that I love about Disney. It is, however, a really nice hotel that I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t caution against staying in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about what you like to make you feel at home!", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auburn Hills, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cFantastic For Young Families!\u201d", "Author": "MickeyMommy", "ReviewID": "UR118675666", "Content": "Our family of four stayed in a 1 bedroom bay lake view villa for four nights.

The hotel itself did not disappoint. I had a magic kingdom view 1 BR appartment for me, my wife and 3 yr old son. the location is great. When going to the MK we used the walkway and when heading out to Epcot we used the Monrail via the MK. The room itself is well appointed and nicely decorated. The property relies on the Contemporary for checkin, restuarants, etc with the exception of the wonderful members only bar on the 16th floor. Check it out for the fireworks and a nice cocktail. The pool at the Bay Lake tower seemed less crowded than the main pool at the Contemporaty but both could be used. My son thoroughly loved the slides at both, not to mention Saratoga pool and Boardwalk Pool (pool hopping). Now the complaints. the monorail broke down 4 of the 5 nights we used it. In one case we were literally stranded at the Floridian for 2 hours awaiting a bus to get us back. On principle I didn't want to pay for a cab but should have in hindsight. I can't blame this on the Bay Lake Tower but patrons should be aware that apparently this has been happening for weeks based on the age of the trains (last upgraded in 92). I spoke with two conductors and they mentioned Disney is aware of the problems and working to fix it. When the monorail works its soooo much nicer for parents with a stroller than a bus as you don't have to close the stroller down. Secondly, and again I can't blame this on Bay Lake Tower but it's something to consider when booking. The MK was closed for a private religious celebration Friday night and saturday. There were sound checks all night long that were so loud my wife was up all night both nights. I too could hear them but slept through them. We live in Boston(in the city) so we are used to noise but this was ridiculous. I can confirm that the Contemporary managers received many, many complaints. The MK side for the extra points may not be worth it. The noise is pretty bad in addition to the sound checks there were trash trucks, car alarms, etc. Overall our experience was wonderful and the lines were non existent but some of the star lost its luster due to these issues that disney shouldb't be allowing to happen. I might suggest the Bay lake side to avoig the noise but gain the same experience at this lovely location and property.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay again!\u201d", "Author": "asty", "ReviewID": "UR118020455", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here this August.

We were booked for a 1 bedroom, but got a 2 bedroom instead. We were located at the end of the tower on the 4th floor. The room conditions were very nice. As we weren't too high on the healthiness of food at the parks, it was really great to be able to make breakfasts and dinners at our place at the start and end of the day. Also, we saved money by doing this since we weren't on a meal plan. We used a grocery delivery service. It wasn't cheap compared to prices at home, but was cheaper than buying meals at the park. Additionally, they delivered the groceries to the Contemporary resort and the Disney staff there stored the bags even before we checked in to Bay Lake. Checking In: we switched from a different hotel to Bay Lake in the park and got dropped off at the front door of Bay Lake. What I didn't know is that the check-in happens at the Contemporary Resort and the front doors to Bay Lake require key card access. Luckily a nice older couple let my family into the lobby to wait (with our luggage) while I checked in at the Contemporary. As I noted, our room was at the end, with a Bay Lake view. It turns out that we actually had a better view of the nightly fireworks, than the Bay Lake boat parade. Both were easily heard from our rooms at around 9:45 to 10p every night. The fireworks are awesome and they are loud - they would shake our windows at night. Our kids were luckily too tired at night to even wake up, though, so we enjoyed the show each night from our balcony. Admittedly it would have been nice to see it at the Magic Kingdom, but our kids were too tired to make the trip for the Electrical Parade/Fireworks. One big reason for us staying here was the proximity to the Magic Kingdom. There is both a walking path and a monorail to the park. Since the monorail to the Magic Kingdom is the last stop from the Contemporary resort, it is actually faster to walk. We did so each morning because it wasn't too hot even in July and I'm not big on waiting. Coming back from the MK we always took the monorail since the kids were pretty tired of walking. My older son and I took advantage of monorail service to Epcot as well, which turned out to be quite easy. For those that don't like to cook, there are restaurants available in the Contemporary resort. We tried the Comtempo Cafe, and the food was adequate. My brother tried Chef Mickey, and his kids had a blast, though probably more from the character greetings than from the food itself - note the character greeting only happens at breakfast buffet. There is also a market to buy some sundries and snacks, which came in handy. We only tried the pool at Bay Lake. It is carded entry and has towel service. The pool isn't that big, but has a pretty good slide for the kids. There is a lounge at the pool that serves mixed drinks and snacks only. Since we were not Disney Club members, one benefit is that our room was cleaned daily. We also took advantage of the fact that each room had a washer/dryer and detergent for a single load.

Very modern, clean, spacious and comfortable for 5 adults and our newborn baby boy. We were on the fifth floor, which I requested because it is the floor connected to the skywalk to the Contemporary. The theme park view of Magic Kingdom was WONDERFUL! We watched the fireworks every evening during our 7 night stay. You can also see the water pageant at the Grand Floridian. The pool and bar, Top of the World Lounge, and clubhouse were great. All the staff we encountered were helpful and friendly. The convenience and location of this resort was perfect, especially with a four month old. It is going to be hard to stay in a resort off the monorail again. With strollers, it is so nice and convenient to load the baby up in the stroller and just glide on and off the monorail versus packing and unpacking a stroller each time you need to use the bus for transportation. When the monorails are overloaded, the walk to and from Magic Kingdom is five minutes, so the many options are great. You also have many shopping and restaurant selections off at the monorail resorts. On evenings that it rained, we hopped on the monorail, went to dinner and shopped and returned to our villa without the worry of the rainstorms.

We stayed in a studio for a week with our two girls, 4 and 6. The room was a little tight, though the square footage might be comparable to a moderate room. You loose some space because of the porch, large bathroom and kitchenette. It was a little tight, but fine for us. The queen bed was comfortable. The pullout sofa was big enough, the kids slept, but it was not all that comfortable. We had a \"lake view\" room, though that was pushing it. rm 7832. We were in line to see parts of the lagoon, the Contemporary pool and building and we could see thunder mountain railroad from the porch. We expected to be able to see the water parade, but only saw the tail end. A little disappointing for \"lake view.\" As DVC members, housekeeping visit once during a week to take out the trash and change towels. We would have liked more, but you can pay for that. The room was clean and as a new building is certainly modern. There are tons of activities for the kids for DVC members in their room downstairs. The fireworks from the roof were cool, but I would argue the angle from the walkway was better and easier to get back to your room (crowds from the 16th floor). We had to watch fireworks every night if we were there, as the kids would be woken up by the noise. It was loud, as were the movies they played on the lawn outside of our room until 10. The convenience to the Magic Kingdom is unbeatable. We walked most of the time, unless it rained. We are quick walkers, and brought strollers, but we were in the gates within 8 minutes. The monorail access is priceless as when it rained or when the kids fell asleep at Epcot, that really worked out. We only used the buses to go to Hollywood Studios once, Animal Kingdom once and Downtown Disney once. We never waited longer than a couple minutes and the kids did not fall asleep, thank goodness. We ended up locked out of the room once, when the scanner at the door needed to be reset, as well as the safe in the room. Due to a \"miscommunication\" they took a half hour to come up and get us in. We were in wet clothes that day, so we were not happy with the slow response. It is obviously a short walk to the contemporary for stores, meals, and front desk help, but that was fine. The gym at the contemporary was adequate. The quick service dining at the contemporary was on the weaker side, not comparing to the moderate or value resorts, as far as choices go.

At 4:30, we were told that our room was finally ready. We went up and the place was still dirty. One of the beds had the dirty sheets from the previous guest balled up on top of the bed, there were finger prints everywhere and the place just didn't feel clean. We called the front desk and they offered us a new room. The staff member that they sent up was very rude while we were trying to decide if it was better to stay put and have them clean, or to move. We ultimately decided to move. The next room was a little better, it at least smelled clean, but it was still pretty gross. There was hair stuck to the bathroom wall and it was very dusty to list a few complaints. The pool area is also gross. The sidewalk is filthy and slippery because it needs to be scrubbed. My son (who was not running) slipped and fell by the slide and skinned his leg. I saw at least five bandaids on the stairs to the slide and on the sidewalk one morning which had to of been from the day before. Some of the \"clean\" towels were stained and gross. The stairs to the slide are grimy...stained with dirt and green mold. The lifeguards were kind of rude. Not one of the budged when my son slipped and fell. Housekeeping never came at all the second day we were there, the third day they showed up at the room at 7:30 pm to \"clean\", but we had just returned from a full day at Epcot and were exhausted. On checkout day, housekeeping knocked on the door at 8:30 am and asked if we were ready to checkout when checkout isn't even until 11. Thanks for the early wake up call...not! When I asked the front desk about whether the room should have been tidied up daily, they said \"no\" because it is a timeshare resort. Another downside is that you are not allowed on the 16th floor observation deck to watch the fireworks if you are not a timeshare owner. I don't understand why they would prevent their guests from using the resort amentities. They shouldn't rent out the rooms, if it is a \"timeshare resort\". The only upside to this place is it is close to MK. But, it's not that close if you think about it.

Proximity to all of the other resorts on the monorail line. This gives you a wife variety of restaurants available that are all just a short monorail ride away. Concerns about staying at the Bay Lake Tower: During our stay, the weather was cool, and not many people used the pool. Even though not many people were at the pool, finding two chairs together was difficult. When the weather is hotter, I think the pool will be too small for the size of the hotel.

We did not book directly through Disney, and rather rented DVC points from a member, an excellent way to save money....(if questions, just google renting dvc points) Anyways, on to the review.....BLT has three booking categories: Standard, Lake View, and Magic Kingdom View. In my opinion, the Lake View is the best as it is cheaper than MK view, and you still have a chance at a MK view as well, worth the risk JIMO. We had a lake view and ended up in room 7712. Had a view of the lake and of Magic Kingdom (MK). They pipe the music in for the fireworks on the TV every night which makes watching the fireworks from the balcony all the more enjoyable. And without the crowds NO less! The rooms are spacious, almost 1000 square feet with a seperate living room area and bedroom area. For those of you who have stayed at DVC b4, you will find the studios smaller, but the other options larger. You will find the rooms nicer in terms of furniture, stainless steel, granite, and 2 bathrooms instead of one. The hotel offers a wonderful pool, albeit small and not as deep, really for the mid range children. perfect for mine at 6 and 7. An awesome 150 foot pool slode doesnt hurt. A beach area, where you cannot swim but hang out in the sand and a hot tub to boot On rainy days, there is a community hall, open everyday to cool off as well, where kids can play video games, do activities, or just plain hang out! There are also movies under the stars most nights as well. Is BLT worth the price? Well if you utilize the monorail it is: How do you do that?

Me and my partner bought into the vacation club in 2009, and had our first stay at BLT in September 2010. We were already sold by the mock-up of the hotel at the DVC Centre, but we were overwhelmed when the Magical Express pulled up outside the Contemporary and we were whisked to the first of two rooms we stayed in for those two weeks. Using our 160 vacation points to their full potential, (and seeing as there were only the two of us to make the whole thing more feasible), we had a ground floor, standard view studio for the first week and switched to a 1 bedroom lake view for the second week. Well, what a treat! The studio was fantastic, a high class hotel room with lovely furnishings and great decor. Admittedly, the furniture was slightly battered in places. But I am fully aware that Disney are addressing this, (somewhat of an oversight of dark furnishings vs. heavy suitcases!), certainly not something worthy of spoiling the stay! The 1 bedroom was out of this world. We were lucky enough to be on the 14th floor, with exceptional views across the lake, the pools and beyond! The suite was just beautiful! Extremely contemporary and classic in design, yet modern, fresh and homely. We had the bedroom and some family joined us for a couple of days and comfortably slept on the pull out sofa-bed in the living area. It certainly felt there was enough space for us all and the 2 bathrooms certainly helped with the morning, pre-park trauma of showering early to get to the parks before opening!! In terms of location, the Bay Lake Tower could not be better. Not only is it within walking distance of Magic Kingdom, (10 mins leisurely walk), but the hotel is linked to Contemporary Resort, so the monorail and bus services are so frequent! I absolutely beseech you, that if you have chance to stay at this wonderful hotel, then don't think twice about it! Book those tickets, pack your bags and get ready to make the magic brighter!

My parents are Disney Vacation Club members and graciously allowed us to use their points to stay here.

The best part about this hotel was the private pool and 14th floor bar for vacation club members. As guest of my parents, all the vacation club perks applied to my boyfriend and me. Every night we sat in the hot tub and on our last two nights we enjoyed drinks at the Top of the World Lounge. Watching the firework show from the Magic Kingdom was amazing, the lounge had the same music playing that is played in the park.

It does have a bit of a sterile feel; it certainly lacks the majesty found in the lobby of the Grand Floridian, for example. One of the real selling points is the convenience \u00e2\u20ac\u201c being able to walk to the Magic Kingdom is a big, big benefit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly if you with little ones. Also you can be at the hotel pool within about two minutes of exiting your room, which is to say, everything is in relatively close proximity. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be put off by a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153standard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd view. Yes, you have a parking lot below, but off in the distance is Cinderella\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Castle, and you can actually watch each night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fireworks from your balcony. And the parking lot doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to involve much activity. The pool is great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly the waterslide \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and you also have access to the pool at the Contemporary. Bay Lake tower rooms have kitchenette. So there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a microwave and refrigerator, but not a mini-bar (a great relief). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little convenience store in the adjoining Contemporary, where the prices are a bit high but not outrageous. Bay Lake Tower doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have restaurants of its own, but Contemporary next door does. If you have kids, Chef Mickey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is great. Minimal contact with staff, but universally friendly and helpful. Quiet room Room itself is a bit cramped for three (or more) people. But the couch pulls out to a bed, which is nice. And I got my best night of sleep on it in months, though this may have had something to do with being completely exhausted after a full-day at the Magic Kingdom. The room was also extremely quiet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recall much of any noise from the outside, except for the gardeners and their very loud blowers in the late morning. No big complaints. I spent some time in the lobby of the Bay Lake, working on my computer, and it has the worst kind of pop-Muzak playing (also in the pool area). It escapes me how anyone could think this is pleasant to listen to. Silence would be much better. Note that if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to places that rely on bus transportation, the buses are on no set schedule, and sometimes they may only run every 15-25 minutes (and then make other stops before getting to their destination). It seemed to take us forever to get to Downtown Disney, and even longer to get back. And it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth the trip. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a glorified strip mall that you can find anywhere else in the United States.

( by my standards!!! LOL ) I will start by saying that we love Disney! Period! We love it so much we became DVC owners in 2009 because we knew we would want to come back yearly, if possible, for life. We vacation in other places..we take cruises and love to explore new destinations...but still Disney is our favorite place. Last December we stayed for our 3rd time at BLT, and our first time with family. We stayed in a 2 bedroom Villa with my daughter and her family ( 5 grandchildren) and then we got my parents a studio across the hall. The rooms were great. Studios are a little small. But the views we have had each time are beautiful. Here are the issues we had: 1. My mother got locked in her bathroom when we arrived. This was just an engineering problem and it was taken care of. But be careful!!! There are no locks on the bathroom but she still got locked in..and I mean she could not get out! 2. Our room was dirty! And not just a little......food under and behind the sofa bed! Dirt so big you could see it when you looked behind the sofa. Ok....we called housekeeping to please clean it and the next day we were told if housekeeping came they would not charge us THIS TIME....like they were doing us a favor. Really? And I was told that was what the manager said to tell me. DVC does not get daily housekeeping which is why they mentioned charging me. 3. and this is the BIG one...pay attention to this please.... The tables in the rooms are football shaped with a wood top....IF YOUR ROOM HAS THIS TABLE EITHER HAVE IT REMOVED OR BE VERY CAREFUL! My 4 year old grandson was getting up from the floor and put his hand on the table to pull up and it fell over on top of him. It is HEAVY! My granddaughter tried to get it off of him but it was too heavy. After my daughter got the table off of him and checked him out the paramedics had to be called just to be safe. It was scary and terrible.....an engineer came up to look at the table and took one look at my grandsons head and said to get a manager up there ASAP. I had already called the manager at that time and she was on the way up. The engineer said they had had problems with these tables and stability before. The manager was very nice and called the paramedics for us. My grandson was OK. Even scarier was the fact that my 7 month old granddaughter had been crawling under that table minutes earlier....I don't even want to think about that. Of note is the fact that my 70 year old mother had been getting up from her table and she and the table began to topple over but my dad was there in a flash to stop it from happening. We did not hear about that until this happened with the grandson. These table are dangerous....just be careful! Please! I know you want to know if they did anything about this...like tell us they would remove the tables from the rooms....no..they did not and I do not think they plan to. I have talked to them a few times and they will not say anything about it. They just say I have to talk to someone about a claim regarding my grandsons head/injury .....we do not have/want a claim about his head.

Our party included four adults (husband, wife, and two grandmothers) and two children (ages 2 years old and 3 months old). Generally, the hotel room was amazing, and exceeded our expectations! The layout was perfect because a living area separated the two separate bedrooms, which afforded everyone a little privacy. Was also great to have three full bathrooms, which we used. Washer/dryer was awesome for those baby blowouts (hotel provided Tide detergent). The room had two balconies and wall-to-wall/floor to ceiling windows in the living room, for breathtaking views and lots of natural light. We also loved the large jacuzzi bath in the master bedroom, which was great for Mom and Dad to enjoy after a long day of walking. We were in room 8002. Our room had a gorgeous view of the Lake with a family of hawks which provided a lot of entertainment for our little ones to watch. The week we visited WDW there were record cold/freezing temps, so it was nice to have such a lovely room to come back to, since we spent more time there than we had hoped. Unfortunately we couldn't use the hotel pool because it was so cold. However, we could see the fireworks from the Magic Kingdom right from the room, which saved us from venturing out in cold temps. Room was clean, convenient, and super close to everything, e.g., a 7-min walk to the Magic Kingdom. Now for the pros and cons: Pros: - Luxurious suite. - Large sized rooms, - Plenty of room for large parties. - Comfortable beds. - Even the pull outs in the living room were VERY comfortable (which was surprising). - Great view. - Nice kitchen facilities - all new and modern. - Layout of suite was nice and afforded privacy for everyone, e.g., separate bathrooms, etc. - Hotel was new and clean and fresh looking. - Lots of places to watch fireworks and water parades from in the hotel, e.g., elevator lobbies, walkways, etc. - Pool area looked nice, even though we didn't use it. - 7-min walk to Magic Kingdom! - Easy access to busses and monorail. - Kitchen facilities to save money on meals (we ordered from Garden Grocer, and our food delivery was waiting for us at the hotel when we checked in. Super convenient!). Cons: - Walls were very thin. E.g., You could hear toilets flushing in other suites above and below, and the flushes were even louder in your own room. We found ourselves leaving #1s in the toilet at night because the flush was so loud it would wake the kids up! - Doors on bathrooms are sliders and do not close all the way or lock (a little weird). - The hotel does not have any restaurants or food on-side, so you have to walk over to the Contemporary to find anything. This is a bit inconvenient, especially when it's freezing out and you have to walk through the uncovered walkway just to get fresh coffee or a snack. It can be a long trek to the Contemporary depending on where your room is located, like ours...far from elevators and walkway. We found ourselves using room service often, to avoid having to make the trek to the contemporary. - Another small con for us was the shower in the Master Bath - it was a nice shower with a double shower option of either a rain shower or normal shower. However, the door didn't close all the way so water kept leaking out all over the floor, which made things dangerously slippery. - Monorail lines were long and trains kept having mechanical problems. We were told it was because of the low temperatures, so things were malfunctioning. So, we found it easier to just walk to the Magic Kingdom. We hadn't been to WDW in 20-some years, so a lot of things had changed and were new to us. For example, we are used to being able to get restaurant preferences at the hotel you stay at. Not the case here. We were guests at the Contemporary, but had a difficult time getting reservations at the hotels there, even the more basic restaurants like Chef Mickey's. We did eat at the California Grill, and the food was quite good (and fantastic wine list). But the prices are incredibly high and perhaps not quite worth it. E.g., $20 for a basic sushi roll. Not somewhere for kids. All in all, we were very pleased with Bay Lake Tower and would most definitely stay there again. It was worth the premium price for us because we had two little ones and preferred a nicer room since we spent more time there for naps, etc. Also because the weather was so cold, it was nice to have more luxurious accommodations.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ashburn, VA", "Title": "\u201cThe Location Cannot Be Beat\u201d", "Author": "MFLetou", "ReviewID": "UR92146079", "Content": "The location is literally the best in all of Walt Disney World. You simply cannot stay in a Disney resort with better views and with this kind of access to the Magic Kingdom (by foot.) Bay Lake Tower could be better. For such a new property, the furniture was rather scuffed and worn looking. The sound insulation is so-so. I wouldn't call it especially luxurious--I think cheap materials were used whereever possibly. The price is out of whack with the level of luxury and service. But, if you are traveling with a family, it is still THE best to stay. We were a bit crammed with four adults and 2 children in a one-bedroom. We knew that going on, and I don't fault BLT for it. It is worth paying for a Magic Kingdom View--we had two separate rooms during our rather lengthly stay and the MK view room was nicer, slightly bigger, and the view was magical. Our kids were so excited to be watching the monorail right in front of them that they could have never moved and be happy. The bed was comfortable--on the softer side which I like with high end threads and fabrics. The pool area is well designed and kept up, and less crowded than many other WDW resorts. BLT as you likely know is connected by walkway to the Contemporary, where there is dining, shopping and the monorail connection. The Contempo Cafe--essentially a fast casual restaurant--was more than respectable for food quality and offerings. And you can watch the monorails come and go--which, like I said, kids love. Chef Mickey's is the big character place, we've done it twice for breakfast and its a chaotic mess. The food, however, is better than you might expect for such a large buffet. The Wave is sort of an afterthought--overpriced, and dark. For breakfast, it can't hold a candle to Kona at Polynesian or the Grand Flordian Cafe (which actually is even better than Kona.) Fortunately, you are a quick monoral or drive away from those two. I rented a minivan which is essential for getting around the World easily--except for MK. The parking situation is excellent--you can park right out front and be at your car in seconds. I received a heavily discounted rate on my one bedroom which was tough to get but worth searcihng for. I would return to BLT--I wish Disney had done a better job at some things, but overally my experience was positive. Disney is a magical place, and so is BLT.

The check-in process is streamlined with the online check-in now, and you check in at the Contemporary and then walk over to Bay Lake. We had a lagoon view. Our room was gorgeous. Not exactly my style in decor, but very stylish and hip. The floor to ceiling windows are beautiful. At night, at 10:10 p.m., there is a lighted pageant across Bay Lake, complete with music. The walk to Magic Kingdom is short, maybe a 5 minute walk. There is easy access to the Contemporary for the monorail, if you wish, through a skywalk. We watched the fireworks one night from the skywalk. The pool area is beautiful and and overlooks Bay Lake! Everything was perfect. The only thing I didn't like, but it wasn't terrible, and this is common with a few resorts, is that you need to walk over to the Contemporary for any food, drinks and mug refills.

Just a quick (5-10 min) walk to MK, which was a blessing upon closing time to not have to wait in an insane line for the bus, monorail or boat. We also used the bus station at MK to transfer between different resorts, very easily. The monorail is very convenient at the contemporary as well as the boat service between the contemp, WL.

The first day, I had purchased a magazine and left it on the bathroom floor and it was gone after the room was cleaned.

Towels were only replaced once daily and my husband left a wet towel on the back of a chair one day and it was still there after the room was cleaned. The room was quiet, which is rare for hotels. So that was a huge plus. Didn't hear kids running or doors banging or loud, drunk people late at night. The worst part about this room was the shower. It was one of those rainfall overhead types. This water flow was so low that taking a shower was a painful experience. (And not to mention, who ever invented the overhead rainflow shower clearly didn't know anything about the anatomy of women).

Certainly it's location stands out as #1. We arrived at the hotel AT 2:30 finding our room available, 10th floor bay view with easy access to the Contemporary via elevator to the 5th floor walkway. Our one bedroom slept 5 people with ease. There were two full baths with a jacuzzi in the masterbedroom, balcony, flat screen in both living room and bedroom, everything you would expect in a vacation club property. Since we are not vacation club members we were unable to access the 16th floor viewing area for the firework display.....not to worry, the view from the 5th floor walkway provided an unobstructed view of Cinderella's castle. This viewing area also afforded you the opportunity to watch to \"Electric Light\" parade on the Bay, however, this parade was BORING. Recommendation - do not waste your money on a Castle view, depending on your room, you will will view the track to the monorail and/or parking lot until the Castle lights up! I have two complaints regarding this property, 1- I do not believe housekeeping is efficient keeping track of \"vacation club rooms\" as opposed to \"guests\". Vacation club members have different guidelines as to the upkeep of the room and restocking of supplies. I was never able to get a firm answer from Concigiere whether the pullout couch and chairbed were supposed to be closed after the room was cleaned each day(as would be on a cruise). Instead the beds were made and left open, which I found to be somewhat inconvienant and made the room like unkempt. Secondly, this may seem like an silly complaint, except this is a Disney property. As you leave the Contemporary heading towards the walkway of the Bay Lake Tower there is a large gated unused landing that runs under the monorail. This part of the hotel had garbage, chairs, wet towels on the floor and dirty cigarette containers about. At no point during our 8 day stay was this area cleaned. Also, being a smoke free enviroment, guests would sit in the stairwell between both buildings smoking - a little unexpected for a Disney property.

When we got there to check in our room was on the 2nd floor we figured great nice and low until we got off the elevatore and there was mold all over the windows. We went downstairs and asked to have our room changed. They did and put us on the 15th floor. The room was very small it was so dirty I refused to let my children touch anything. There is a few issues with the room itself. First of all we have never stayed in a hotel that did not have locks on the bathroom door or where the bathroom door had a sliding door. If someone had to come into the room to fix something and was carrying a bag and hit the door by accident it would open up. The second problem was the kitchenet/bathroom vanity. It is all in one area so to the left is your little kitchen area and to the right is the bathroom vanity so if I am blow drying my hair and someone is making a bowl of cereal my hair could fly into the cereal. That is so unsanitary!!! Then there was the issue of bug. I killed 4 bug in my room. My husband went downstairs to tell the manager and the hotel did nothing about it. Every year our children get something sent to the b/c it is their birthday. My husband told the hotel when booking it the date of their birthday, added it into the computer and at check in told them. Our children had nothing sent to them on the day of their birthday. So when my husband went downstairs to talk to the manager about the bug situation and all the other things going on he asked why our children didn't even receive a card and they told him it wasn't put into the computer so the next day they sent up a balloon and card . It was like they put it together to shut us up. There was no ice machines or vending machines in the hotel so if you wanted a drink in the middle of the night you would have to walk over to the contemporary.

We had a 2nd floor, odd numbered unit at the end of the hall near the stairs by the pool. We loved the fact we could walk out our villa door and down one flight of stairs to get outside to the pool. We could also use our key card to enter the stairwell to get back up to our villa. Our reserved view was \"bay lake\". From our two balconies, we could see the lake in the distance beyond the pool. The pool was in our direct view. Also we were right by the shuffleboard courts. The palm trees provided some privacy for the 2nd floor so we didn't feel like we were \"open\" to the courtyard below. There was always good music playing outside our balconies to be heard in the courtyard and pool area that played until about 11pm. We could also access the community room quickly via the stairway to the outside and across the courtyard to the outside door access to the community room. My two oldest kids enjoyed the activities in the community room like foosball, tie die t-shirt making, internet access for games and wii. The villa and building at BLT is new and very elegant with a contemporary feel. The colors are cool and inviting. There are three full bathrooms in the two bedroom villa - a wonderful thing when everyone wants to bathe/shower at the same time. The master bathroom has a large whirlpool tub separate from the shower/toilet area so it was very handy. One interesting thing is the wall between the master bathroom and master bedroom consists of three sliding doors so you can open up the tub area to the master bedroom and view out the balcony. Check in was a breeze at the Contemporary Hotel - we arrived around 5pm and received our keys and were in our room after a short walk to the BLT building across an open walkway. The walkway was awesome - covered to keep the sun off but open to get a great breeze. At night you can watch the fireworks at MK and hear the soundtrack that goes along with it. There are also movies that played nightly on the lawn below the walkway. My kids loved looking over the rail to see what movie was on. We used Disney transportation exclusively upon arrival at the Orlando airport. The Magical Express was efficient and our luggage did arrive within 2 hours of our arrival at the hotel. We used the bus system to get from BLT to DHS & AK. The bus stop is between BLT and the Contemporary so it was a short walk to the bus stop. We never waited over 15 minutes for a bus - even when leaving the parks to return to BLT. We used the monorail for access to Epcot and MK. It was easy to access too - using the walkway from BLT to the Contemporary 4th floor - to the escalator/elevator up the monorail platform. The monorail only goes one way from the Contemporary so you have 3 stops before you get to MK. When going to Epcot you go one stop and exit the monorail to transfer to the Epcot monorail. It's a short walk around the station but very well signed and the wait was really short each time. We purchased the Disney Dining Plan with our package (BLT and park tickets) but we will never do it again with young children. Even for ourselves - it was too much food at one sitting - for adults you get a dessert with every meal! And most meals were very filling before you even got to dessert. The 20% savings basically meant a free dessert that we didn't want anyway. Sometimes we got dessert just because we were entitled (already paid for it) but ended up throwing it away without even tasting it. We had a nice meal at the California Grill and didn't use the dining plan because it takes 2 of your table service meal \"coupons\" and we didn't think that was a good value. The best character meal we had was at MK Crystal Palace. The characters were Pooh and friends and the food was very tasty and variety for everyone. Chef Mickey's character breakfast was good too. It was a good way to use the Dining Plan for breakfast and priceless for the characters and how delighted the kids were to meet them at our table as they made their way around the dining room. We noticed the wait times at all the parks for most rides were about half what they predicted on the signage for each ride. I think this is due the the use of fast passes and them not knowing how many of them will return at a certain time. We happily stood in lines marked 40 minutes only to find out our actual wait was about 20 minutes. We did use fast passes at MK, DHS, and Epcot and found them to be very helpful but at AK we thought they were not helpful - I think it's due to the small park size and smaller attendance than at the other parks. The walk from BLT to the MK took me 10 minutes by myself - and it was a brisk walk. It would probably take an average family with young children about 20 minutes (pushing stroller) at a \"stroll\" pace. It took about 30 minutes to get from our villa to MK via monorail so it does save some time but it's a hot, sunny walk and our kids enjoyed riding the air conditioned monorail. The Luau at the Polynesian wasn't very good - pretty cheesy. Our kids did enjoy Mickey's Backyard Barbecue at Fort Wilderness campgrounds though. The characters interacted with all the kids on the dance floor for about an hour (at least). My son danced with Mickey, Minnie and Goofy. He loved it! We did not like the fact the Magical Express picks you up 3 hours before your flight time. We also used the resort airline check in for our return flight home. It was great! Although after the BLT/Contemporary ME bus stop you also stop at the Polynesian, Grand Floridian and Wilderness Lodge on your way to the airport you have plenty of time. We fudged our flight time with the ME booking center and left only 2 hours before our flight and made it to the airport (about a 20 minute ride once you pick up everyone at all the other resorts) in plenty of time. The lines were long for security at the airport but it moved faster than we thought it would. Overall it was a great, six night trip basically because the BLT two bedroom villa was SO nice and we had such a great location in the towers. One other thing was to use the elevators on the north side of the building and not the elevators that you come to first when you cross over the walkway from the Contemporary. Everyone uses those south elevators and they seemed crowded but since we were on the north side (facing south) we passed right by all the people waiting for those \"first\" elevators. Also, because we faced south, the morning sun did not blaze into our villa - it was a perfect location. We didn't care that we couldn't see the MK from our villa - we went to the 15th floor elevator lobby on the north elevator side and watched the fireworks from MK. We couldn't hear the soundtrack but the sights were great and the booms could even be felt if you were touching the glass. We have stayed at Grand Floridian, Polynesian, Wilderness Lodge and the Nick hotel and we will definately stay at BLT from now on!!", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cLousy Lake View\u201d", "Author": "dweedledee", "ReviewID": "UR73833054", "Content": "We visited in June 2010, in a 2 BR \"Lake View\" room.

There were swampy looking trees that blocked a significant part of our lake view. On the positive, we could view the fireworks from our balcony. Disney REALLY NEEDS to reclassify the views.

There was also a lack of towel bars we had wet towels hanging from door knobs. The shower head was painful or just barely a trickle. The kitchen/sink area was cramped but bath area was huge. Why they didnt hang more bars is beyond me. The lobby was usually deserted and automatic doors were always open, not very secure and let in bugs. Elevator was extremely slow and smells from contemporay trash area overpower the walkway to contemporary. Big complaints about observation deck on top of resort. Dont take your kids as they will not be able to see fireworks over wall. I had to hold them up and they would not let stand close to wall while holding them. So we were having to look over someones shoulder to try and get a view. It could have been a good view but distraction of having to hold up a 9 year old was not worth it we only went up there the one night. Seems to me they could put some type of stand for the kids to see over the wall or placed open railing like that on the contemporary observation deck. Resort and room not up to typical Disney Standards but location made up for the short comings, Hopefully Disney will work out the kinks in the coming year and we look forward to next year.", "Date": "August 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perry, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "carolvk", "ReviewID": "UR73114098", "Content": "Staying on property at Disney is a must if you have older kids.

That being said, I regret that one of those resorts is BLT. Having stayed at many deluxe and vacation villas over the years, we could hardly wait to stay at the newest property. First, the positives. the room was beautiful, spacious, and had a magnificent view. We were on the eleventh floor with a lake view. Loved the picture window in the main living area, and the additional bathroom was a plus with three children. The building itself is impressive, and you can't beat being walking distance to MK. The room was also very private, and the building very quiet. Now, for the negatives. First, the other reviewers are correct in that it is extremely inconvenient to have NO desk staff at BLT. Every question, issue, or even a snack or magazine requires a schlepp over to the Contemporary. The security doors were either propped open, or inoperative for most of our stay. The door to the left of the North Tower elevators was stuck open, and the lobby was filled with thousands of black bugs. The distance from the Contemporary doesn't seem like a big deal until you are traveling it several times a day. I was also disappointed that the security that they touted as being prevalent was completely eliminated with the broken doors. Next, the room. I know I am a neat freak, so I try to give a little slack when staying in a hotel, but this room was DIRTY. Note to Disney:Do not have black furniture if you never dust it. The carpet was badly worn, sofa had a huge tear in the cushion, and we were missing many kitchen tools, a dustpan, vacuum had a broken belt, and kitchen floor was dirty and sticky. Housekeeping was not answering their phones, so took us two days to get a replacement vacuum, and we resorted to helping ourselves to the housekeeping cart for towels, toilet paper and tissues. The lack of locks was also an issue-just weird. There was also an obvious lack of staff, as room service trays would be sitting on the floors outside of rooms for days before being picked up. Everything was just too dirty and worn for a new hotel, where the rooms are $500.00 plus a night. The view was also a little strange. No one has a dedicated MK or Lake view,based on the shape of the hotel. We had more of a view of the A-Frame, and had to crane our necks to see the lake, from our tiny balcony. All in all, not up to Disney standards. We then spent 5 days at Jambo House, with a Savannah view, and couldn't have had a better experience. Spotless room, friendly staff, and available dining/shopping options, all in a much older resort. We offered our children a choice of resorts for next year, and they all chose AK, and a return to Beach Club Villas. Sad that we now own points in a resort no one wants to stay in again. Finally, the pool is tiny, dirty, and worn. Also, the pool hopping rule is a joke, as the locked door was propped open the entire time we were there. Never had to use our key to get in, and as a result, was unbelievably crowded. Pool seems too small for the resort. We spent our time at the main pool and quiet pool at the Contemporary.

The first 3 days we stayed at the Animal Kingdom Kidani Village(which was amazing!) and the last 4 days we were at Bay Lake Tower. Bay Lake was very disappointing and did not come close to how awesome Kidani was. At both resorts we stayed in a Grand Villa. 1. The staff at Bay Lake was not as friendly as other resort staff. Everyone was uptight and we did not feel as welcomed here. 2. The maid services were not good at all. Our room was missing many of the kitchen utensils such as bowls, a cookie sheet, and kitchen towels. When we called down to get these items, the man who brought it up was unfriendly and acted as though we had inconvenienced him. Our room was not as clean as the other resorts we have stayed in. There were MANY stains on our couch and the TV stands were dusty (it looked like they had not been whipped down in a week or so) 3. Poorly designed rooms. THERE WERE NO LOCKS on any of the doors including bed rooms or bathrooms. In fact, the bathroom door was a sliding door. Not so good for a big family. The rooms were a lot smaller then the rooms at Kidani. 4. Not as secure as they advertise. When we first got there they told us we would have to use our room key to get in and out of the building and the pool area but throughout the 4 days I was there, I only had to use my room key once to get into the building. All the other times the doors were propped open or unlocked. The door on the 5th floor leading to the contemporary was open 24/7. 5. If you want to do anything you have to walk to the Contemporary. There are no shops or real restaurants to eat at in Bay Lake Tower. For example: If you want to get a gift from a park sent to your hotel you have to get it sent to the Contemporary. Another example: The Airport check in is at the Contemporary. Another Example: No fitness center at Bay Lake.. you have to go to the contemporary. Another example: to get to any park you have to walk to the bus stop or the monorail AT the contemporary. If you want to get to the magic kingdom the best thing to do is to walk there (it was about 5 minutes). If you take the monorail you have to go all the way to the Ticket and Transportation office, then to the polynesian and the Grand Floridian and then finally Magic kingdom. The only thing that makes this place worth staying in is the view! Yes it is very close to the magic kingdom which is nice but it is extremely far away from Animal Kingdom, Hollywood Studios, and Downtown Disney (Expect at least a 25 minute bus ride). To get to Epcot you have to hop monorails which takes a few minutes. The last night we were there, we watched the Magic Kingdom fireworks show from the Top of the World Lounge (Which only allows 75 people in and everyone who goes there must be staying at Bay Lake) The view of the show was awesome!

The Contemporary has allot of appeal with its architecture, decor, the monorail in the lobby, the view and so on, but an unexpected highlight for me was the location. With monorail right there in the lobby, access to the Magic Kingdom and Epcot is easy and convenient and with the bus stop just outside the main lobby entrance, catching the bus to other Disney Parks and attractions was a breeze. Also with the bus, you're at the beginning of the run to the other parks so we always got a seat, and coming back we were the first ones dropped off. Crowds on the bus and monorail weren't bad at all, far less than I was led to believe they would be. Transportation by boat is also available at this resort. This ease of transportation made staying at the Contemporary well worth the money! Regarding the room, I have no complaints. The room was tastefully furnished in a kind of a \"retro-contemporary\" look (make sense?!) and not the Disney theme that we experienced at the Disneyland Hotel in California. The room was comfortable and clean (I found the bed very comfy) and the cast members always made sure we had clean towels and linen and things were in order. The room was quite with the only thing breaking the silence was the occasional over excited child in the hallway trying to get their parents to move a little faster to get to the park (what else would you expect at a Disney hotel) or the nightly fireworks at the Magic Kingdom. These are sounds you would associate with a stay at Disney and so they only add to the \"Magic\"! The only complaint we did have is that there is no counterpace in the bathroom to put things on. Also it is a long walk from some of the rooms to the main lobby, so if walking is an issue with you, keep this in mind. As for the restaurants, we ate at the The Contempo Caf\u00c3\u00a9 and The Waves Restaurant. The Contempo Caf\u00c3\u00a9 is a self serve restaurant and was handy when you wanted to grab a quick breakfast before you head off to the parks. The food is ok, actually some of the baked goods were tasty, but it is a bit pricey as with most things at Disney but it is kinda cool to watch the monorail pass by when you're eating at the Contempo! The other restaurant, The Waves, the food and service was very good with the only complaint I had was the food is more adult oriented so sometimes our 12 year old ordered off the child's menu. Unfortunately with the child's menu, the portions were a bit to small for him. Other things at the Resort include a couple nice gift shops, an arcade, a pool with a slide and lots of activities to keep the kiddies entertained. You can also watch the fireworks from the resort and they pipe in the music for it, so it's a great way to watch the show, and avoid the crowds. Check-in and check-out was easy and there were no issues. Staying at the Contemporary also allowed us to use the airline check-in service so we checked our bags and got our boarding pass right there at the resort. Not all airlines use this service so check with the resort to see if yours does. That's it.

Most families at this resort had small children and the parents didn't seem to care that they were screaming in the hallways and elevators, and running through the concourses.

Accomodation wise, the old A-frame building had much better accomodations. The resort itself is true Disney with breathtaking views from the observations deck and great views of the fireworks and water parade. Great pool, shopping, laundry, and dining (both quick service and table setting) .

In researching I found that there was nothing closer to the Magic Kingdom than the new Bay Lake Tower. The 2-bedroom suite that we stayed in was larger than I anticipated. The kitchen+living area was quite roomy (I was expecting something more akin to an extended stay hotel). The view was also much better than I expected. We booked a Magic Kingdom View room, and while I had a lowered expectation of being able to see the castle out of the corner of the window, our room was located on the 10th floor in the center of the building with a direct unobstructed view of cinderella's castle and the Magic Kingdom! It was even more magical at night as we had a front row seat to the nightly fireworks which we could watch from the comfort of our living room. The proximity to the Magic Kingdom is excellent. During busy times (i.e., after the parade or fireworks at night) it is a short stroll back to the hotel. It also doesn't take long to walk over to the Contemporary to catch the monorail or the bus access to the other parks. We did find it quicker just to drive to Animal Kingdom and Hollywood Studios. The added benefit to the 1 Bedroom or 2 Bedroom suites is the full kitchen and washer/dryer. It made for a much easier Disney vacation. We were able to play longer and have a much better experience had we stayed in other accommodations. We visited the pool once, but did not have much time as a storm blew in. In the back corner is a splash pad with sprinklers where our 1 yr old and 3 yr old both had fun. Be sure to bring your DVD's! The room came equipped with a DVD player as well as inputs if you want to hookup your laptop. The only technological downer was the internet. There was no wi-fi available, though hi-speed is available via ethernet. It is an additional $10/day for access. Also, AT&T wireless service was only worth using near the bay window or on the balcony. Also, check-in was great. We arrived early for check-in (check-in is at 3pm, we arrived at 12pm). The staff took our bags and stored them for us while we went on up to the Contempo Cafe for lunch. By the time we finished lunch the front desk sent a text that our room was ready.

After an early morning visit to one of the parks we left early and were hoping to check in, get changed, and hop in the pool. We went to check in at about 1:30 and were told that in fact check-in was not in fact until 4pm so the room was not ready. I am reasonable and was not bothered by this fact. The clerk kindly offered to notify us via text when the room was ready. My expectation at this point was that although we might need to wait an hour, maybe even two, that we would be able to check in soon. Somewhat complicating issues for me was of course the fact that we were travelling with a coterie of 5 small (5 and under) children. So off to the pool from there - we hung out in the heat for over two and a half hours, with me checking my phone every 15 minutes to no avail. 4pm comes and goes and I go to inquire about the status of the room. As mentioned in other reviews the BLT is not staffed for check in, so I use one of the concierge's phones to call the main desk. The receptionist then tries to give me a song and dance about how (1) they are at 100% capacity, (2) that our room was the last in the group to be cleaned, and (3) rooms aren't actually guaranteed until 5pm. Frankly for the price paid and for a premium hotel (which I use often as I travel frequently for business) these excuses don't matter. We had been waiting for over 2.5 hours to check in with no indication from the hotel that it could possibly take that long. I was disappointed and spoke to a manager (who offered a room upgrade - which would seem hard to do if they were at 100% capacity). The upgrade was from the pool side to the Magic Kingdom side and not substantial nor worth our inconvenience in my opinion. Further adding to my annoyance at check in was the fact that there were elevators out of service in each of the two banks of elevators (I think 3 of 8 total were out of service). I had to spend a total of 15 minutes waiting to get on elevators since we had to share them with all the service people and others going in and out at time of day. This should not happen in a premium hotel and I found it unacceptable. Our room was spacious as mentioned, and tidy, but I don't think it was clean. Lots of stains on the couches and gave the impression of being given a quick wipe-down rather than a deep clean. My final complaint was the WiFi. I had a hard time getting it to function with my work computer and when it did work it was incredibly slow. Seriously like dial-up speeds. So all in all I can score this hotel as Average at best. I expected more as the experience was poor relative to other premium hotels I have stayed in. If I had to stay at a Disney hotel again it would not be this one.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cBay Lake Tower Best Out There\u201d", "Author": "JasminedogLosAngeles", "ReviewID": "UR68261555", "Content": "We are Disney Vacation Club owners at the Disney Boardwalk Villas and our family of 4 decided to try the Bay Lake Tower at the Disney Contemporary Resort. We used our points for a 6 night June 2010 stay in a dedicated two-bedroom villa. At the time of booking we were fortunate to be able to reserve a Standard View villa since these required fewer DVC points and are relatively few in number. Check-in was inconveniently located in the 1st floor lobby of the adjacent Contemporary Resort. The 4th floor contained a small convenience market, gift shops, 3 restaurants and the Disney World monorail station. A small corner exit of the 4th floor led to the walkway that connected to the 5th floor of the Tower. We arrived in the evening and were assigned a Standard View villa located on the first floor (Unit 7144). I was initially disappointed and was concerned about the view and location, but there were no other Standard View 2-bedrooms available upon check-in. The desk clerk was of little help in securing a higher floor Villa since we had reserved a Standard View unit (no luck for us). However, upon entering we were pleasantly surprised at the contemporary interior design of the spacious villa. The furnishings were still generally new (given that Bay Lake Tower is less than 1 year old) and the floor layout was well designed. My teen son commented that it was designed like an urban loft condo. We were also pleased that our ground floor Villa was an end unit in the south wing of the Tower and faced the Contemporary Resort boat marina and Bay Lake beyond. Villas from the 2nd to 16th floor of the Tower had enclosed balcony railings. Our villa on the ground floor was open to the grassy lawn surrounding the tower and felt quite spacious and open since no balcony railing was needed. The only downside to the ground floor unit was that the large picture windows and sliding glass doors afforded little privacy at night, requiring that our drapes be drawn (during the day, the reflective glass of the Tower eliminated any interior views from passersby on the outside). Initially hesitant and concerned, we concluded that our Villa location at the end of the 1st floor hallway allowed for a quiet and private location. The end of hall location also made it very easy to exit the building to conveniently access the Bay Cove Pool area and the building\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inner courtyard with the bocce ball and shuffleboard courts. An added bonus was that a few yards from our patio one could access the small and deserted white sand beach fronting the marina with plenty of sand chairs available for quiet sunning. The ground floor location also made it very convenient to access the Disney World shuttle bus stop that was shared with the Contemporary Resort guests. The dedicated Villa had a Master Bedroom with a King Bed, a small writing desk, side chair, flat screen TV and a great master bath with spa tub, glass enclosed shower, and plenty of drawer space. In the dedicated 2-bedroom Villas, the second bedroom contained two queen beds, flat screen TV and a much more spacious bathroom with separate sink area (since a separate exit door and kitchenette are not needed in the dedicated 2-bedroom). The living room featured a queen pull out sofa bed and a twin side chair sofa bed, DVD player, flat screen TV, built-in dinette and a small third bathroom (making morning wash-ups very convenient). In total, the 2-bedroom Villa could sleep 9 persons. The contemporary kitchen had a stainless steel refrigerator, stove, microwave and dishwasher; excellent lighting; a great kitchen island and breakfast bar that had cabinets and drawers; and two clever slide out pocket door pantries that easily stored our breakfast items. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes and cookware, although I did have to call housekeeping to request a few missing items from the kitchen inventory. The staff responded quickly and delivered the missing items. There was plenty of closet space and the Villa was furnished with a wood high chair, pack-n-play, vacuum cleaner and stacked washer and dryer. On three of our nights we viewed the Magic Kingdom fireworks from the Top of the World Lounge (access only for Disney Vacation Club owners). It was a cozy and very beautiful lounge with floor to ceiling windows providing awesome views of the surrounding Disney World property. The rooftop deck was spacious and provided views of the fireworks with a piped-in soundtrack from the Magic Kingdom. The Magic Kingdom is an easy 10-15 minute stroll from the Tower if one did not want to wait for a monorail. The Contemporary Resort fitness center was adequate with plenty of cardio and stacked weight machines. The fitness center was available for 24-hours which was a major plus. We also rented two Sea Raycers at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Marina, which allowed us to zip around for about 45 minutes on the Bay Lake and Seven Seas Lagoon of Disney World. Other watercraft were available for rent from either the Contemporary Marina or Sammy Duvall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Water Sports (both shared the same marina building). The marina also provided fun and convenient transport boats to get to Wilderness Lodge and the Fort Wilderness area of Disney World. The Bay Cove Pool was a family pool that, frankly, could have been designed larger. Forget about doing exercise laps in the very busy and kid-filled pool here. It had a fun twisting water slide, zero entry area and an adjoining water fountain play area. On busy hot days, I would imagine lounge chairs would be at a premium. Towels are provided and the adjacent Cove Bar offered a limited lunch and drink menu. The Bay Cove Pool was restricted to guests staying in the Tower. Our only concern for the future would be the on-going housekeeping maintenance of the Villas, since full housekeeping service is generally only done after a family checks out for stays of 7 nights or less. I noticed that some of the shower tiles were in the beginning stages of mildew accumulation, some of the carpet areas were showing tread wear and tear, the kitchen stove top was getting scratched, some of the wood surfaces of the furniture were chipped or scratched, and some of the curtain blinds were damaged from careless guests. Nevertheless, we would highly recommend the Bay Lake Tower and will definitely return and even request the same unit. The pleasant Villa made our Disney World vacation a joy to return to each night.", "Date": "June 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "raleigh,nc", "Title": "\u201cImpressive and convenient!\u201d", "Author": "raleighgal", "ReviewID": "UR68022527", "Content": "Very pleasantly surprised!!

It was AWESOME. We were on the 4th floor near the elevators in a three room suite. It was huge. The pictures online do not do it justice. I have four kids ages 4-17 and my husband and i were a party of six. This was perfect with so much room to spread out. The three bathrooms were great to have. The master had a nice walk in shower and whirlpool tub. I used the washer/dryer every day. The full kitchen was very sleek and functional. I had grocer.com deliver in groceries for some of our meals and snacks. My kids loved to be able to see the monorail go by our window and see the MK and fireworks every night. It doesn't have the \"theme\" atmosphere of other disney locations unless the theme is \"sleek, modern, future\" style, but it has mickey mouse pictures and designs and for me location and convenience with four kids trumped the theme aspect. They also showed movies on a big screen on the lawn downstairs every night and of course you could see the lighted boat parade too. My 9 year old enjoyed the arcade. You have access to 3 pools, the one at bay lake and the other two at the contemporary. My kids liked the fountain at the contemporary pool and the slide at BLT. This hotel was VERY quiet and peaceful a great break from the parks. The location is everything. If you can stay on the monorail do it. It saves you so much time and is convenient especially with tired little ones. I was also able to easily access events/places at the polynesian and Grand floridian using the monorail. To get to the monorail and counterservice/chef mickey's etc. you have to walk across a skybridge to the contemporary. We had lovely weather so it really was no big deal, but it could be windy and it would probably be unpleasant in bad weather. Bell service seemed very busy and behind a lot, so expect to wait 30 minutes or so for your stuff instead of the 15 minutes they tell you. My room was cleaned daily and very well done, although we didn't experience any towels made into animals or anything like that. That's OK, i couldn't make a towel into an animal if they wanted me to either!! The maid was very nice and friendly. Balconey doors have locks thank goodness. If you have little ones be advised that the balconey railing is the type with a concrete footer (that can be climbed) and a shorter railing on top. My only complaint is echoed by others: there are no locks on the bathroom doors or interior doors. The bathroom doors slide and with no latch or lock they would sometimes bounce back open repeatedly. Even if everyone is family, you should have a way to keep others from accidentally walking in on you. And Mom and Dad, if you are seeking privacy in your master bedroom after the kids go to sleep i recommend propping the desk chair against the door! (it worked :) ) But this was a small thing. Our stay was wonderful we all enjoyed this \"home\" away from home. 5 years ago we stayed at Port Orleans, what a difference! If you can splurge or get a deal go for it it is worth it!!

LOVED the space. I have 3 girls and the 1BR was perfect for us. My 7 yr old twins slept in the pull out sofa and my 9 yr old slept in the pull out chair (nice sized - size of a twin bed). From reading other reviews, we asked for a even # room on an upper floor. We ended up on the 3rd floor (even #)...we didn't want to wait for a higher floor to come available. The view of bay lake was great and being on the 3rd floor turned out to be very convenient ...could use the stairs to get to the pool and outside easily. This hotel was the most quiet hotel I've ever stayed in. We could hear the evening light parade, but it was only for about 10 min. The only drawback was the lighting in the bathroom. Both bathrooms had horrible lighting. I challenge any female staff member at this hotel to go in there and apply their makeup. Bring your own lighted makeup mirror -- you'll be glad you did. Pool was ok -- geared toward younger kids. Bring a few pool toys to help pass the time. The pool doesn't go deeper than 5 feet and there's no room to swim laps. We used the garden grocer and it worked out great. Groceries were there B4 arrival and we had them delivered to our room 10 min after check in. Take a trip up to the 15th floor to check out the views from the windows - we got some great pics. Don't bring dishwasher soap -- they have that and paper towels. Wish they had a baking sheet, just had a small glass pan for our nuggets & fries. They didn't replace our clothes washer soap, so you may want to bring a few 'singles' packets. BTW - there is no bus service to Epcot. You have to take the monorail and change at the WTC. If you have an early breakfast booked, don't book it B4 8:30. We left on the first tram at 7 am and barely made it there by our reservation at 8:30 (they do safety checks early in the am).

Had an even numbered room on the 12th floor overlooking Bay Lake and the grounds of the Contemporary. The room was large and comfortable with a very nice kitchen and 2 baths. There was a comfortable pull-out couch in the living area and also a pull-out chair. The bed in the bedroom was comfortable, if a little soft. Bathrooms were very clean. Stacked washer/dryer was great but a little loud. The sliding doors to the bathroom in the main room and the shower/toilet part of the master bath were not a problem for us, as others here have suggested. The location of this hotel makes it well worth the money. You can walk to the Magic Kingdom in about 5-10 minutes. The Contemporary is the first stop on the monorail leaving the MK, which is also very convenient. Our room overlooked the lake, not the theme park. I thought ours was a much nicer view. If seeing the fireworks from your room every night is a priority, then pay for the park view. But during the day, you really see very little of the theme park and mostly a parking lot on that side of the hotel. We were able to view the fireworks from the bridge connecting BLT to the Contemporary, which was nicer than having to fight the crowds leaving the MK after the fireworks. The pool area is terrific, except that there is very little shade. The only umbrellas are attached to tables. If shade is important to you, you might have more luck at the Contemporary pool where the trees are more mature. There are great water slides at both pools, and a fun walk-through fountain for the kids at the BLT pool. We ordered groceries from gardengrocer.com and found the service to be very convenient. It was a little inconvenient to have to walk to the Contemporary if you needed front desk/concierge services. It would be nicer if the lobby of BLT was staffed. Also, at certain times (morning, dinner time) the elevators were busy. When we first checked in, our kitchen counter was full of crumbs. That was our only housekeeping complaint. But there was ample dishwasher and laundry detergent. Finally, the resort charges $10 a night for wired (no wireless in the rooms) internet service. I thought that was pretty outrageous, given the high cost of the room. Free wireless is an amenity I would expect at a hotel of this caliber.

The living and kitchen area were in the middle of the bedrooms, which kept each family very private (and we couldn't hear each other - crying or whatever). The pool at the Bay Lake Towers had a zero-entry and small slide PERFECT for little ones who just wanted to splash around. It also had a little \"splash\" area, with padded floor.

We also shipped a box down via UPS that had all of our diapers, formula, baby food, etc - so we didn't have to pack everything. That box was brought up to our room about 10 mins after we checked in. Check in was easy and of course 99.999% of the people in Disney are always nice. The roof top lounge for DVC members was great and hopefully that remains a perk for DVC members only. The room itself was neat and clean, by disney standards it was big - but not as big as what you get at a typical timeshare resort. The layout was kind of strange - not sure you really need the third bathroom. Now for what I didn't like - NONE of the interior doors have locks???? OK, that is just a little too modern for my taste. Not sure what Disney was thinking here but there should be locks on these doors - if not on the bathroom doors than at least on the bedroom doors - the main bathroom in the common area really should have a lock as well. If you go with guests that aren't family this is a little strange. The main building should have check in, and they need some type of store and place to grab a quick snack - very poor oversight. Finally, the beds stink! I don't know what it is with places that spend a ton of money on showerheads but skimp on the pillows. I love having a nice shower, but I NEED a nice pillow and mattress/bedding. Everyone in our party were complaining about the beds and even people we met in the roof top lounge were saying the same things. Hopefully disney listens - of course that just means our annual fees will go up to make these changes, but hey - it would be worth it! The only minor thing I would point out is that if you get a lake view room, that electric parade on the water is annoying and loud - our 4 year old woke up a couple of night because of it, after a few days there they were so tired that they slep through it, but that show is very loud so next time I would try a MK view.

The view was the Contemporary pool area and the harbor. Floors 1-9 begin with 7*** and floors 10-16 begin with 8***. If you are on the 4th floor the numbers are 7402-7444. If you are on the 15th floor the numbers are 8502-8544 so the second number is the floor and the last two are the location on that floor. If you want a view outward towards Magic Kingdom, you need to reserve an even numbered room between 8414 and 8430. Odd rooms look at the Bay Lake harbor and pool area. Those are nice views too however. The lower the floor the less the view so I recommend floors 5 and up. We had a studio room, the smallest available. Two adults and two preschoolers fit nicely in this room, although crowded. Since we don't spend a lot of time in the room, that was fine for us. There were a few design flaws in my opinion. There was no stool for the kids to reach the higher level counters. That was difficult to hold them up to wash hands and brush teeth. The mirror in the sink area was 24\" wide, leaving a squishy area for two adults to groom themselves (my husband is a mirror hog). There is no full length mirror (sorry ladies). The kitchenette is nice, but crowded because it houses the bathroom sink as well. Loved the bathtub and toilet area. Beautiful glass tile. Overall, loved the decor. The balcony was nice but I wish they had childproof locks so the kids couldn't unlock the door on their own and get to the balcony. Close supervision is necessary. Cabinet space is nice but counter space for \"stuff\" is narrow in the room area. Loved the pull out couch because the kids were protected from falling with cushions. I wish there were food options in Bay Lake but a short walk to Contemporary solves that problem. I would stay there again but might upgrade to a one bedroom for more space.", "Date": "February 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bartlett, IL", "Title": "\u201cSo Close to the Magic\u201d", "Author": "picc_2", "ReviewID": "UR56865118", "Content": "We stayed at Bay Lake Tower the new addition to the Disney Vacation Club (DVC) on the same property of one of the first Disney World hotels The Contemporary.

You can WALK to Magic Kingdom, which at the end of the day, after the Fireworks get out, is a super plus. Everyone else was scrambling to get to their bus/monorail/boat, and we strolled out, about a 10 minute walk max. Our room was 8036 on the 10th floor. From our room, we viewed Bay Lake & the Contemporary pool. We also could see the EPCOT fireworks each night. I would recommend requesting an even-numbered room on as high a floor as they will give you. Getting an even number allows you to be on the outside of the crescent shaped building, which is much better for your view. We originally were assigned an odd numbered room, and luckily were able to switch. Although this resort is a bit pricier than some others, I believe the convenience of the location (it is the only resort you can walk to the MK from), being on the monorail line, and the amenities in the rooms are completely worth it.

The resort is beautiful, with fantastic grounds and rooms. The decor in the rooms is great, and the beds were quite comfy.

While a higher floor would have been nice, our room was located on the 5th floor, which is the same as the sky bridge connecting BLT to the Contemporary. We are DVC members, so we spent a couple evenings at the Top of the World lounge on the 16th floor. It is fantastic and a great place to watch the fireworks from Magic Kingdom. While its supposedly for DVC members staying at the resort only, I think it largely depends on who is working the lounge check in desk. The first visit we were asked for our DVC card, our 2nd visit we just asked to be let up and he did so without asking for anything. A few things of note: The showers are incredibly powerful, almost painfully so. A trick Iearned was to only turn the shower lever slightly over and that reduced the pressure. In addition, we are used to staying at Boardwalk and walking right back to the resort from Epcot at the end of the day. While being connected to the monorail is a great attraction, be prepared it will likely take an hour to return to BLT from Epcot if you stay till their fireworks. If Magic Kingdom is your primary park, it cant be beat, as its a very short walk over. Also some may have noted already, but the bathrooms are not exactly private.

BLT is very conveniently located next to the well-known Contemporary Resort (CR). Parking is free. There is a connecting walkway to CR for easy access to the monorail to Magic Kingdom and Epcot. In fact, Magic Kingdom is close enough to walk, especially when monorail is quite busy (e.g. after fireworks). Plus by walking over to MK, you can catch a bus to anywhere without having to change buses. Of note, check in is at the CR. Most of the amenities are at the Contemporary (e.g. restaurants, shops, concierge, health club/spa, business center, marina). DVC members have access to all the amenities at CR (but not vice versa). But it is somewhat inconvenient to have to walk over to CR if you just need a little something, like milk.

We had both a one and a two BR villa for a party of 2 and 3 respectively. The decor of both the Contemporary and the Bay Tower may be off-putting to some (it's very 70's in a sort of Brady Bunch meets Jeff Lewis meets Airport Lounge way), but the rooms are big, and having a second full (albeit smaller) bathroom in the one-bedroom villa makes life a lot easier for those with families. The two bedroom villa had 3 baths. Everything was spotless, sparkling, and new as can be - with the exception of the tens-of-thousands of flying ants that seemed to be everywhere around the outside the hotel entrances at night. Thankfully, by the next morning they were lying dead in sprawling piles all around the same locations either because they spray every night or because they only live for a few hours after sprouting wings. We opted for the \"Magic Kingdom\" view and paid a considerable premium for what turned out to be predominantly a view of the front parking lot, with the MK off to the right - I uploaded a photo from our 4th floor window. What we got was an ugly view and a lot of traffic noise. The interior view rooms that overlook the pool are a far better deal and the view is also much better, so I'd recommend those unless you absolutely must see the top of Cinderella's castle peeking out over the tree-tops. We had a few complaints regarding noise - banging/slamming/stomping - sure, this is WDW and there are lots of kids and families around, but this seemed to go on all night long, so I'm really not sure what the source of the noise was. The walls are thin - I could hear conversational level voices from the adjacent room. It's an awkward location - connected to the main Contemporary Tower by a bridge on the concourse/4th floor - the whole tower just sorta sprouted up on a sparse plot of land. If you want any type of refreshment or snack - a drink, something to eat, etc, there is nothing at all in the Bay Tower to be found and you've gotta schlepp it over to the main hotel (there are vending machines on each floor but they only dispense candy). Lastly (and this is a huge pet-peeve of mine) they do not offer free high-speed internet. 10 bucks a day for a wired hookup. No wireless in the room. Come on, nowadays internet service is commodity and pervasive, and lots of people carry laptops/netbooks when travelling so it's not just a \"business\" amenity. As an aside, I have a few comments regarding the overall experience that aren't specific to the hotel per se. 1) At-hotel Flight Checkin: There seems to be an overall lack of coordination with the hotel check-out process and flight checkin/boarding pass issuance. We were only provided with one pass, despite their being 2 in our party, and then had to stand in the checkin line at the hotel not once, but twice, to try to resolve the issue. But again, that's all part-and-parcel of the WDW experience - expect to spend the majority of your time while you're there *waiting* in some sort of line. 2) Magical Express Bus Confusion: Upon departure, a non-Disney (labelled Mears Transport) bus appeared at the Port Cochere, and we barely noticed because it wasn't clearly announced that that was the bus we should board - I suspected it was \"our\" bus and I am glad that I asked the bus driver, or else we would have left without us. 2) We were there for Halloween. We've been going every year for \"Mickey's not-so-scary Halloween Party\" at the MK, and every year it has gotten progressively more crowded. It was so crowded in Fantasyland this year that we literally could not move. There is supposed to be Trick or Treating throughout the park, but this year, I estimate there were about 1/3 the stations than in previous years - we only were able to get close enough to one of those stations inside the park. 3) Shuttle Bus service around the resort seems misallocated and not sufficient. We waited for a bus more than a half hour to go from the Contemporary to Downtown Disney, and the return required a similar wait.", "Date": "November 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cWe would go back in a heart beat!

We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been assigned the fourth floor, but at check-in were moved to a studio on the 15th floor overlooking the pool and Bay Lake. The view was nice. Off to the side was the lake, the pool was right down below and we could see the other wing of the building across the way.

The studio itself was much smaller than I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d imagined, even after looking at many pictures and layouts on the web.

Our room was handicapped-accessible - not something we asked for or needed, and we would have preferred a regular room. The accessible layout has a larger bathroom with two showers, but a MUCH smaller kitchenette. The kitchen counter was so small that the coffee maker hung partway over the edge of the sink. Not enough thought went into that! The pool is not very big, but really attractive and fun. It's one of those \"safe\" pools - no water deeper than 4 feet. The slide is really cool. There's a pool bar and beach adjacent to the pool, and you can also stroll right over to the Contemporary to use their marina and pool. There's no restaurants or shopping at BLT, but again, the Contemporary is a short stroll away.", "Date": "October 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "tyler", "Title": "\u201cPerfect compliment to the resort choices at WDW!\u201d", "Author": "relaxalot2", "ReviewID": "UR46325654", "Content": "We had a four night stay at Bay Lake Towers during late August. We realized this being a newly opened resort, their could be glitches. The only notable disturbance was a middle of the night fire evacuation on our first night, but upon inquiry the following day we were told everyone was safe and the alarm sounded because a door to the room where they keep the helium tanks was left ajar by the service staff. Oh well, we were safe, right? The room was amazing. Very modern and sleek design. We stayed in a one bedroom with lagoon view. The living area had a sleeper sofa and a sleeper chair, so our children were able to have their own beds every night. The jacuzzi tub and powerful shower head was amazing to our sore and achy bodies following long days at the parks! Although we would have preferred a MK view, the lagoon view gave us first look at the electric water pagaent nightly, we thought that was a nice perk. Location is SO important in WDW, and this resort is perfectly located next to MK, easy walking distance and the monorail at the Contemporary. Navigating the park system from BLT was very easy and we never felt pressed for time. I would recommend Bay Lake Tower to friends and family.", "Date": "October 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBay Lake Tower - our home away from home.\u201d", "Author": "lindabobhat", "ReviewID": "UR45753254", "Content": "We stayed at Bay Lake Tower last month for a long weekend. We are DVC Owners and this was our first trip \"home.\" We booked a 2 bedroom villa/condo with a Bay Lake View. I had read that even numbered rooms were on the outer part of the crescent and offered partial Magic Kingdom views, so I requested just that, on a high floor. Our room request was honored - we got room #8102. It was the last room on the outer side heading left from either elevator bank. A long walk, but well worth it to only have neighbors on one side. And considering that our only neighbor liked to smoke on their balcony, this was a big plus (it's a big plus no matter what - we stay in hotels a lot and love to be at the end of the hall away from the elevators = much less hallway noise.) We had a dedicated 2 bedroom unit, which means rather than a 1 bedroom lock off combined with a studio, it was an open unit with a distinct 2nd bedroom with 2 queen beds, and no additional mini-kitchen. We specifically booked this kind of unit and were very happy with it. I took the master, my mother-in-law and son took the 2nd bedroom, and my daughter opted for the sleeper chair in the living room (she could have had the queen sofa bed but liked the cozy chair better.) It was plenty of nice private space for the 4 of us and would have easily accomodated more comfortably. We could have dealt with a 1 bedroom unit, but I didn't mind splurging on the extra points since we only stayed for 3 nights. Highlights/Pros: Easy check-in; we did the online check in and arrived at 2PM on a Thursday afternoon. There was no line at the 'express\" desk at the Contemporary Resort. Our room was not ready, but they texted us just an hour later to say it was ready, and included the room number in the text message. it was a smooth, easy process. I didn't think checking in next door at the CR was particularly complicated or difficult. Big spacious condo - I highly recommend asking for an even numbered room, as they are in the outer part of the crescent shape of the building - this makes for a wider living area because it's on the outer part of the curve. If you look at some of the other pictures in the reviews, the inner units facing the pool have straight lines - there are no barstools on the kitchen island and the living rooms are noticeably narrower. Nice modern decor - this is not everyone's cup of tea, but it suits us perfectly. We love modern, sleek hotels with clean lines. 3 wall mounted LCD TV's. 3 bathrooms in a 2 bedroom unit (and 2 bathrooms in a 1 bedroom unit.) Only one other Disney property offers this perk - Animal Kingdom Villas. The master bath is particularly nice. A separate shower with 2 shower heads (one rainfall head mounted on the ceiling.) The jacuzzi tub is adjacent to a slider wall so it can open up to the master bedroom. I didn't find this a particularly great feature, but if you had a true Magic Kingdom view you could feasibly watch the fireworks from the bathtub. I will say that the tub was a generous length - I am 5'10\" and I enjoyed using it very much - I could get my whole body underwater. Fabulous views - Bay Lake straight ahead and to the right; Magic Kingdom to the left. We did not watch the fireworks from our room, but we could have if we wanted to. Fully equipped kitchen with stainless steel appliances. Mind you, we only prepared simple breakfasts and snacks; it was perfectly functional and we could have gone a bit more elaborate with meal prep if we wanted. Great comfortable, luxurious beds - my daughter even loved the chair sleeper. Perfect location on the monorail via the CR next door. Yes, there was some walking involved but we enjoyed taking in all the scenery. Same can be said for restaurants and shopping. Honestly, it kept the resort itself more quiet and relaxing - but we could get anything we wanted next door if we needed it. Best of both worlds if you ask me. Really nice pool, hot tub, water slide and splash pad. Plenty of lounge chairs, at least when we went there. Reasonable prices at the pool bar. Access to other pools at the CR if you wanted to check them out. Lowlights/Cons: First and foremost, the neighbor who smoked on his balcony. I had the sliding door open in my master, returned to my room and as I turned the corner, thought, \"what is that smell?\" It was just wafting into to my bedroom. I shut the door and called the front desk. They said they would send security up to handle. We left the room for the evening. Returned later to relax and enjoy the balcony and he was smoking again. I called the front desk once more. I didn't have to deal with him smoking anymore, but he liked to throw his cigarette package wrapping and foil insert on my balcony - I found this twice. I think it was his subtle way of letting me know he was mad that I complained. Despite the resort only having been open for less than 2 months, the rooms were already showing some wear and tear. I also hated the way the dark laminate cabinets and furniture showed dust and fingerprints. DVC members don't get housekeeping so this was especially noticeable after the first day. One of the faucet handles in the master bathroom was broken. The A/C was not very efficient. It was hot when we checked in so I set the thermostat down to about 68. It was still hot. I couldn't even put on makeup without breaking a sweat. I turned it down to 65 (as low as it would go) waited overnight to see if it kicked in but no such luck. Called maintenance, who came up before we left to go swimming. She said it was fixed, but it really wasn't much better. Maybe a little cooler, but I left it on 65 - if I did that at home I would be freezing and it wasn't even close. If we had stayed more than 3 nights, I'd have likely complained again. Overall, I was very pleased with our stay and plan to stay here again. Since I'm a DVC member and it's our home resort, that's pretty much a given. But we really liked the decor, the layout, etc. The resort really does suit us. We also enjoyed watching the fireworks up in the lounge, which was a really nice perk of being a DVC owner here. Speaking of DVC perks, our internet access was free. As others have mentioned, there is only one HSIA port in the master bedroom - you could bring a wireless router with if this doesn't work for you. And to those who are not DVC members and complained about paying $9.95 a day for access, this is true of ALL Disney properties. There are, however, several free Wi-fi sites at the various properties if you just need occasional access. I don't think this is outrageous. Most mid to upscale hotels (Hyatt, Marriott & Sheraton to name a few, charge the same exact daily fee for internet access.) By the way, we ordered room service once - typical, adequate, slightly overpriced fare, much like any hotel. I was truly glad they offered it, but it was nothing out of the ordinary.", "Date": "October 3, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Bay Lake Tower at Disney's Contemporary Resort", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34515-d1489438-Reviews-Bay_Lake_Tower_at_Disney_s_Contemporary_Resort-Orlando_Florida.html", "Price": "$494 - $639*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4600 North World Drive</span>, <span class=\"extended-address\">Lake Buena Vista</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Orlando</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">32830</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1489438", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/f1/90/0d/la-piscine.jpg"}}
