The hotel and room was clean overall and in good condition. We had a king size and our son slept on the pull-out sofa bed. It was nice that there is a wall between the living room and bedroom sections, although it is not closed off completely. We stayed for about a week and the breakfast never varies, so after a while, it gets tiresome as the food is just standard fare. The hotel was full while we were there, but there was always room in the dining room. I noticed that quite a few people just grabbed food and brought it upstairs to eat in their rooms. If the weather was warmer, it would have been nice to eat outside as they had some tables set up, but it was too cold in the mornings. For a business traveler, the location near the airport is very convenient but be aware that Route 536 is full of tolls in all both directions and heading to the Kennedy Space Center, we could see that they were in the process of adding yet another toll plaza! The hotel's wireless internet in the rooms is pretty slow. It takes a very long time to load pages, and if you use the hotel's computer, its browser is so ancient that it prevented us from ordering online tickets. Because of their computer's limitations, printing docs is a real pain. Their network needs a major upgrade. Having a laundry room is very handy for business travelers who have to stay longer than expected. You can just walk down the hall instead of hauling everything to a laundromat. Most of the time we used the stairs instead of the elevator and the stair case is carpeted in brightly striped colors and well lit. The remote control for our TV had some kind of problem with the power button and it always took several tries to get it finally turned on. The hair dryer also did not work at all. Everything else was fine, or we did not use it, so we're not sure if they were okay. Daily room service was good. Overall, a very good hotel. Room was quiet even though it is near the airport.

I hold no ill feelings towards SpringHill Suites or Mariott Hotels. This will just be for informational purposes for others. We spent two nights here on our honeymoon. The first and the last night in particular. We did this to try and maximize our time on Disney property. The first night we called the hotel from the airport to get a shuttle. I don't think you actually HAVE to call them. They tell you one will be there in around 15 minutes. If you do call though you will be guaranteed a spot. Don't quote me on this, just seems that way. Everything with check-in went fine, the room was nicely cooled when we got in there. Shortly after we went to Tony Roma's for dinner. In my opinion it wasn't as good as I was expecting. We shared a meal though and got a free appy because we were staying at SpringHill. If it weren't for that we probably would have gone somewhere else. Back at the hotel the room was a nice size and the bed was comfortable enough, but after being on a plane for 7+ hours and a 1.5 hour layover with another 45 minutes waiting on the taxiway we could have slept on a few bales of hay to be honest. The next morning we stuck around long enough to have some of the free breakfast. I must say the selection was nice, from muffins and fruit to cereal, to hot items like sausages and bacon. They even had waffle irons to make your own waffles. If you want hot chocolate just ask one of the staff and they can get it for you. We got a ride shortly after back to the airport to catch the shuttle to Disney. The last night of our trip we stayed again. It cost a little bit more this time, but not a big deal. Oh I should mention, they never checked my ID for the AAA/CAA discount. Just thought I would mention that. Upon check-in the guy working the front desk asked us if we would be ok with an accesible room because there were no regular king rooms left. We were fine with that. I was actually curious to see the difference. All I can say is that the room seems a lot bigger. The walking areas are much wider for obvious reasons. The bathroom has a walk-in shower with a bench in the back. Other than that, nothing to complain about with it being accesible. One complaint we had though was the complete lack of a garbage can. I'm sure this was just an oversight and I pointed it out to the manager. After cheking in we had booked a time for the shuttle back to the airport for 5:30 am as we had a flight back to Vancouver at 8:30am. After we got to the room my wife decided to call the front desk and set a wake-up call for 4:30 am. The night was a little rough as the AC wasn't on when we got there so we turned that on for a little bit, but it was too loud to leave on all night. Suffice to say we both got a little warm and sleep became more restless. Well I got woken up by my frantic wife at 6 am going...WHAT TIME IS IT?!?! Clearly the wake-up call we had requested never came. We jumped out of bed and got dressed, missed out on the breakfast we had bought ahead of time as we wouldn't have time for the hotel's. As we were getting ready the room's phone rings and the girl at the front desk wants to know if we want on the 6 am shuttle as we had missed our 5:30 am shuttle. I was just like you notice THAT, but not our wake-up call??? Anyways, she apologized and when we finally got downstairs I reiterated my anger about not getting a wake-up call. The girl was like \"Do you have any questions about your bill?\" All I could say was \"Yeah, why do I have to pay it when you can't even wake me up on time?\" The end of the story is a happy one though, we made it on our flight although we smelt and felt gross and the stress was not a great way to start the day nor end our trip. All in all if I ever had to stay near MCO again I think I would stay here again. Only the next time I'll be sure to set my own alarm.

I asked the woman, \"how could this happen?\" She said, the reservation system keeps accepting bookings although they are full. So, despite the good reviews, you might want to reconsider committing to a booking at this hotel. I, for one, really hate coming to a place with full expectation that I have paid for a place, and finding that they didn't really mean it! OH, and according to tripadvisor, their hotel is 3 star, and the place they put me in is 2.5 star (Hawthorn, Wyndham, which is very close). Not having seen the hotel rooms here I can't compare the quality, but if your star rating system means anything, they put me in a lower standard place, and did not offer me any financial compensation for a price difference. Of course, this is extremely difficult to pin them down on, as the prices change day by day! So I guess they can get away with anything they want, attributing it all to their faulty reservation system? You be the judge... From my point of view, it looks a bit dicey.
