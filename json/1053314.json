{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Ok, but DON'T USE ORBITZ Stayed at the Puntacana Hotel. It is a beautiful setting, and the people were nice. It is one of the few places in Punta Cana, that doesn't offer all inclusive. I booked a package deal with Orbitz, offering only breakfast and dinner. When I got to the hotel, they said I didn't have any meal plan. I would have to settle that problem with Orbitz directly, and they couldn't help me. They did offer a 3 meal plan for $850, though. I reluctantly took the offer. I sent two emails trying to explain my predicament to Orbitz, but they never answered me. I couldn't phone them without giving an unknown foreign operator my credit card information over the phone. ( I wouldn't do this, as it isn't recommended.) When I checked out of the hotel, the bill was staggering. I explained there must be a mistake, and to the desk attendant's credit, he went over the bill for about an hour, making numerous phone calls and reduced the bill by about $400. The bill still was very hefty. Drinks were not included, and they were very pricey, and sometimes were very low quality. There were also numerous expenses that I was surprised by. The hotel experience was marginal, but the ORBITZ experience was HORRIBLE! Days after I returned, I sent a registered letter to ORBITZ explaining the problem. They never answered the letter. I later called them and the first person I talked to offered me a $100 travel voucher. I declined and they gave me a supervisor. The supervisor offered me $200 which I also declined, and I was given a third supervisor. After rambling and basically saying nothing, this person offered me nothing! He claimed they never offered any meals (being that it was offered on their web site that was no longer available I couldn't show proof) what really was outrageous is that he then denied that I was previously offered any compensation by the two people I talked to before him! While at the hotel, other people complained to me that they also were not given the 2 meal plan that had been promised online.I will never use Orbitz again, and I'm considering legal action. I will be very cautious about relying on web site offers that can no longer be referenced if there are any discrepancies. The mood of the entire vacation was soured from the start by the complication of being denied the meals that were advertised. The lack of response from Orbitz added to the ill feeling, and their subsequent actions were nothing short of outrageous. I not only feel cheated about the meal plan, but the entire experience with Orbitz has so soured me that I can't even think about the vacation in a nice way. I searched on line, and I see I am not the only person treated in this fashion by Orbitz.", "Date": "Apr 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR978724214", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "TFO"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g147293-d1053314-r15460333-The_Puntacana_Hotel-Punta_Cana_Dominican_Republic.html", "HotelID": "1053314", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
