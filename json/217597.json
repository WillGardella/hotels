My two sons aged 6 and 3 slept on the pull out. We were on the sixth floor overlooking the pools. We arrived Saturday night on St Patricks day. Everywhere was packed full of drunks and rowdies except for the Hilton which was very peaceful. We went to the Flamingo Club pool in the mornings and then switched to the HGVC pool at noon once the sun was overhead. It was nice you could bring in your own food to the HGVC pool area. No need to complain about the noise from the Flamingo Adult pool anymore. The jackhammers from behind the Imperial palace drowns out any music. I can see going forward this will be a main complaint about the pool area. A huge new, new orleans themed Casino is going to be constructed and I am sure many will not like the noise. We loved the huge jetted tub in the room. My sons demanded to take a bath everynight. All staff we encountered were extremely polite and helpful. Location was great. One day we walked to Circus Circus and the next day we walked to Manadalay Shark tank. Saw two magic shows -Nathan Burton (free) and Mac King ($13) Our kids also loved the birds and flamingos by the entrance to the flamingo.

We had a 15th floor room with a view of the Flamingo Hotel pool and could even watch the Bellagio fountains in the distance. The hydabed that my son slept on was much more comfortable than most hotel hydabeds, although I did have a little trouble figuring out how to get it set up. I was able to figure it out though without getting help. As we did a retail rental, we had daily maid service. There is a little store and deli downstairs which is super convienent to pick up snacks, breakfast, or a sandwich. Staff were super friendly and helpful and some even knew us by the end of the trip. The two bedroom confguration is a little strange, as first there is a door to enter and then there are two other doors that need key access -- one to a one bedroom condo and one to a studio. We just turned the locks backwards, so we could move freely without have to us the condo key. My mom took the lockout and we took the one bedroom and used the one bedroom LV/DR/Kitchen as our main hang out place. It's a little tricky getting around with a car till you learn the ropes because of all the construction going on.

We had a very pleasant experience at this hotel. I will say one thing, many of these reviews claim that this hotel is all one-bedroom suites with full kitchen etc. that is NOT true. We were in a studio and the kitchen area was minimal. Had a toaster, coffee maker, sink and small fridge. The hotel is a bit old so don't expect anything glamorous, but it is clean and cozy non the less. If you are set on spending time at the pool, make sure you call ahead and ask if it will be open. We were told that the pool was closed and was being resurfaced and would be open on the 5th, but then they extended that to the 10th. The Flamingo GO pool was also closed due to early season. They did have the smaller family pool at the Flamingo open for use but it was very crowded. Just saying - do your homework before you go. All the reviews about this hotel being close to the flamingo and strip are very true. This Hilton is a great location and a short stroll through the Flamingo to the strip. Because this hotel is off the strip and not part of a huge resort it tends to be fairly quite and not rowdy like many other Vegas hotels. Good for families and working trips. Also, the staff was very friendly and helpful with any questions or requests we had.

The hotel is not even a three minute leisurely stroll to the back entrance of the Flamingo. Once inside, the monorail is only an escalator ride and another very short walk away. We took the monorail once to MGM. In my opinion, the Flamingo is the best location on the strip. We repeatedly walked to the Venetian/Palazzo towards the north end of the strip and The Cosmopolitan towards the south end. Ceasars, Bellagio, and Paris all seemed like a stone's throw away. We had a one-bedroom suite which was perfect for the two of us. The full refrigerator and freezer with an ice maker came in handy. We had previously stayed at the HGVC on the strip near Circus Circus with another couple who slept on the sofa bed. The living room at the HGVC Flamingo is much smaller and I wouldn't want to stay in the one-bedroom suite there with two couples for a whole week. Check out time is 10am, but they let us remain in the room until noon. Our flight didn't leave until very late so the bellman offered to hold our bags.

We tbooked a 2 bedroom suite that was perfect for our needs. The rooms and bathrooms are very spacious, and having a living room with a kitchen was great. As you may have read in earlier postings, the 2 bedrooms are just that, they share an entryway, but then immediately split off into two separate rooms with standard heavy hotel doors to each. Great for couples, maybe not so good for families. The location could not have been better. Out our window we could look down into the Flamingo pool, that was closed for the season. A little to the left you could watch the water display at the Bellagio. The Hilton is about a 1 min walk, if that, to the Flamingo. It's literally next door. I really loved being just a tad back from the strip, away from all the smoke and casinos. It was a little quiet oasis in the heart of all the action. You can walk anywhere from the Flamingo, which is about in the middle of the strip, very close to the Bellagio and Paris, etc. Some folks noted that there are steps from the lobby down to the desk for check-in and out. This is true, it's about 4 steps. I didn't find this an issue. You leave your bags at the top of the stairs, the bellmen watches it if being 15 feet from them is a worry. Check-in and out only took a few moments, there was never a line. Compare that to the tons of crowds waiting in line at the Flamingo or anywhere else, it was great. There is a small heated pool that the Hilton has on site, as well as a gym. This hotel looks and feels like a regular Hilton, from the rooms to the lobby. Expect the same workout machines and space for the gym. It's not huge, but it's also not too crowded, so we were able to get a good workout in without any issues. Also in the lobby is a little store where you can grab coffee, breakfast sandwhiches, deli stuff, water, beer, wine and liquor.

The hotel itself is \"reasonable\" - its price justifies a lot of its shortcomings, but only to a point. So shop around. First, this is not a \"real\" Hilton property - this is a re-done former timeshare, and it shows. There is no Executive lounge, no room service, no upgrades (they give you 2000 bonus points), there is free WiFi, however. There is a concierge to store your bags and a tour operator to make a reservation for you.... There are steps to reach the check-in counter, so be ready for hauling your suitcases over the steps at least twice. The elevators buttons require a card at all times so your guests would need to wait for you downstairs. Two rooms share a single entrance door, so you will definitely hear your neighbor open two doors (the front and their own), which are VERY noisy. The checkout time is 10am, but the staff can adjust it to 12pm. After hours, the telephones, wakeup service and whatnot is handled by the phone operator at the Flamingo - which can lead to problems (it did for me - no wakeup call was recorded). There are rarely any taxis at the hotel entrance - you have to schlep all the way to Flamingo's taxi line to get out. a MAJOR inconvenience. You can also ask a concierge to order one for you - add extra time, a tip for a concierge, and a tad more for the taxi driver.

The view was a peak of the strip, but since this property sits back from the strip, not really a true strip view as you might get at Bellagio, etc. Our room was located down a long hallway from the elevator, but we liked it as it was away from everything and VERY quite. The room was typical of HGVC properties. LR/DR/Kit combo. The kitchen is fully stocked with full-size appliances. Plenty of room for storing as much food/beverages as you wish. Didn't matter to us as I do not go on vacation to cook! The bedroom is very large with a HUGE jacuzzi and bathroom sink/drawers There was another bathroom with shower,toilet and sink/drawers. There is plenty of space in the bathroom, however they could have a larger dresser in the bedroom for clothes. Two flat screen TVs (who goes to Vegas to watch TV?) one in LR and one in BR. The room was very clean with plenty of amenities. The valets/bellmen were terrific and very helpful. There is a mini-mart type store with counter for salads/sandwiches and Starbucks coffee. The ladies making coffee were very nice and friendly. Overall, the location is best part of this hotel. It is a short walk to the casino and the monorail. Everything was fine, except the furniture and carpeting was tired looking. Having just stayed in a couple brand new HGVCs it was quite a disappointment.

It is located just behind the Flamingo and away from the strip. But for our taxi cab driver, he wasn't familiar with the HGV Flamingo so make sure you tell them the property behind the Flamingo or you could be paying a few extra bucks for the cab like we did. It's about a $16 cab ride from the airport so just a few more than taking a shuttle but more convenient. When you enter, there are 3 stairs going down to the check in. Either they want you to drag your luggage down those stairs (and lift them up) or they want you to use the bell service. The check in went smoothly and the front desk staff are all friendly. There is a welcome desk that you are directed to for coupons. The coupons include a free hypnotist show (you may the service fee thoughs), Margarittaville, 10% off at Macy's, and a variety of other eateries on the strip. If you want show tickets, you can get a discount but they are only offered if you sit in on one of their presentations. If you are staying here a HGV member, don't bother going. You can get cheaper tickets at the numerous tix for tonight locations. We stayed in a one bedroom which including a washer/dryer, dining area, full kitchen with coffee maker, tea kettle, dishwasher, fridge, and stove, living room with tv, bedroom with another tv, 2 sinks and counter space, shower, jacuzzi, and a closet with safe. It's big enough for 4 to be comfortable. They also have free wifi and morning paper. They only offer one housekeeping visit for a week long visit and be prepared to pay if you want it and stay less than a week. The reason I'm giving it 3 instead of a 4 is that one day they shut off the water for 8 hours. I get they needed to replace the water tank but the timing wasn't ideal for us as we like to sleep in later so we had to make sure we showered, toileted, and washed up before the cut off time.

The lobby area is nice, free wifi terrific, staff are excellent and the pool area is pretty good. We also liked their small grocery store where we could get Starbucks Lattes. But...we stayed on the 2nd Floor of the North Tower which had its drawbacks. Walking through a dismal hallway from the lobby to the North Tower to take the elevator to a floor that seemed to have only 4 rooms per floor, we felt out of touch in that area and never saw anyone else except if we looked out at the pool which was right below us and people sitting at the pool were no doubt easily able to see us if we were at the window. As a previous poster said, the carpeting need replacement and the hallways can use some cheering up. The suite itself was ok. We had a full one bedroom. The kitchen was well set up with granite counter, it was nice to have two separate rooms with sinks and if you like a swimming pool sized jacuzzi bathtub, this place is for you. The living room furniture could use an update. As far as bed comfort, I have a major pet peeve. For the life of me, if you are going to provide a duvet, get proper duvet covers with zippers rather than use a flat sheet as I am pretty sure these duvets are not cleaned in between guests. Others had commented about the noise from the Flamingo pool . We only noticed it on the day we arrived and wow is it thump thump loud. Think it's only on the weekends as we hadn't noticed it any other time. The walk to the strip is easy, either through the path to the Flamingo Hotel or a side lane off the North Tower. I was a bit hesitant about the lane but there is always lots going on with delivery trucks etc so never felt unsafe, except there are limited sidewalks and traffic so need to be careful. If you must have a car (we did), the parking garage is creepy (maybe just me), and while it is easy access from the North Tower, it would be a bit of a walk from anywhere else. I would pay the $10 per day valet and let someone else park and get your car for you. Would we stay here again?

My husband and I have been to Las Vegas numerous times over the years and have stayed up and down the entire strip (Caesars, Signature at MGM, Bally's, etc). Since I was bringing my young daughter and husband, we decided to try the suites since we were Hilton Honors Silver Elite members, for the convenience of the kitchen and in-room amenities (washer-dryer) and the great location near my conference. We arrived late Wednesday night and were given a corner, ground floor room in the South tower. I called a few weeks before to specifically request a quiet room away from the elevator. Apparently, the message was not received as we were put into a room that was one room away from the elevator and the windows faced the loud Flamingo \"adult\" pool. Because of the late hour and traveling with a young child, I decided to stay in the room. Here's a summary: Pros: 1) The room size was very large (1-bedroom suite) and fairly clean. A few years back we had stayed at the Signature at the MGM so the room size at the Hilton Grand Vacations was bigger but the rooms at the Signature were much nicer. 2) Kitchen was well stocked with kitchen utensils, plates and large refrigerator (for leftovers). Washer and dryer had detergent ready for use and was a nice convenience. 3) Location was perfect. You could walk easily to Bellagio to see the water show, City Center for shopping, Venetian and other casinos. The Flamingo casino was close by so having a place to gamble nearby was nice since there is no hotel casino. 4) There was a store in the hotel to grab quick drinks, food or other supplies. Employees were very friendly and cafe (didn't try the food) seemed like it had some nice selections. Cons: 1) The hotel is surrounded by a loud and noisy pool. The music from the Flamingo \"adult\" pool was unbearable. It started at about 9AM and continued until 5/6 PM, everyday. I tried to take a quick nap during the stay and the dance music was pulsating through the windows. Again, I didn't complain because I believe every room in this hotel can hear the obnoxious music. Dance music is fine, but keep it in the clubs. At the end, when I complained to the person checking me out, he just shrugged and said they could've moved me to another room that wasn't AS LOUD but most rooms could hear the music. Some friends were staying in the Flamingo hotel in a high floor room overlooking the pools and you could hear the music from their room so he was probably right. 2) I enjoy gambling some but really love going to Las Vegas to sit by the pool and relax in the sun. The hotel pool had no sun until about noon. It was gone by four or five. I wasn't even able to enjoy sunshine by the pool, especially with the 90+ degree weather. The only time I had available, the pool was chilly and the lack of sun made for a cold dip. The Flamingo (family) pool was similar in that sunshine was intermittent throughout the day since the pool was sandwiched between buildings. I believe the adult pool had more sun but didn't get a chance to go there. Having stayed at Caesars where the sun shines all day long around the pool, it was a very disappointing experience at the Hilton. 3) Beds were not that comfortable. The mattress was lumpy and the sheets that they replaced on one night had a large iron stain that had a hole burned through. For a Hilton, that was very disappointing to see. How hard was it to miss a big dark brown stain with a hole in the middle of the bed? 4) The shower glass door was not a tight seal so there was constantly water from the shower on the floor of the bathroom. Overall, I would not be staying here again. There are plenty of choices along the Strip that have better amenities and nicer rooms.

This was our fifth visit to this property, and even though we have tried other hotels, we always seem to come back to the HGVC Flamingo for its smaller feel and easy walk to the mid strip. Our room was a huge 2 bedroom/2 bathroom unit with more than enough space for four. I like the fact that in addition to the king bed in both rooms, the second bedroom also has a pull out sofa. This works out great for my son and daughter. The only drawback to the 2 bedroom unit is the entryway. You walk in a set of double doors to a small hallway, then each room has a separate entrance/locking door. Each unit is self contained, which may not be ideal for families traveling with very young children. I was hesitant to leave our doors open overnight, but also didn't want to lock out my 11 year old son (entrance would have been with key entry only) in case he needed something during the night. But it all worked out OK. There is a very well stocked deli and mini mart in the lobby for snacks that was open from 7am-10pm which was nice if you needed something and didn't want to drive or walk to get it. We rented a car, but it was more of a convenience than a necessity. It is a very short walk from the HGVC to the strip right through the Flamingo lobby and casino.

The room was immaculate, and everything worked fine. I loved having a washer/dryer right in the unit-- saved on over-packing.

It opens early so you can enjoy it before the heat of day (over 100F). There are plenty of shady spots around the pool and walkways to escape the sun. The exercise room has good equipment and was never crowded. There is also a small deli in the hotel where you can buy coffee and sandwiches and snacks, along with small amounts of groceries for breakfast and lunch. Prices are higher than in supermarkets, but were comparable to the Walgreens we found farther up the Strip. After all this is Vegas. The location is superb. It is behind the Flamingo Hotel, and guests simply use the walkway around the pool to the front of the Flamingo to go to the Strip, or walk through the Flamingo to the Monorail to access points farther up or down the Strip.

When we arrived, there weren't any non-smoking rooms available. However, the staff went above and beyond to make us comfortable. They immediately brought up a machine to remove the odor (it worked) AND they moved us completely the next day. It was no trouble at all, and illustrated exactly how customer service should be. Speaking of the staff, this property is small enough to really build relationships. The bell staff (especially Josha) and all the valets were personable, professional and went above and beyond.

My daughter said the hide-a-bed wasn't too comfortable, but I have never slept in one that was. The unit was clean, had all the kitchen things we would need, and the decorations tastefully done. We went to Costco and bought some groceries (and alcohol). It was about a 10 minute drive and well worth the time spent. I read some reviews about the noise from the Flamingo pool. We could definitely hear the pool during the day, but it wasn't annoying, especially since the pool closed at 6pm. We actually liked the music from the pool as it added a \"party\" feel to our pool. My daughter chose to use the pool privileges at the Flamingo, but it was a little too much of a \"party place\" for our tastes. The Hilton pool was just a regular pool, but they have nice chairs, a BBQ area and was clean. We didn't have any problem finding chairs.

The Flamingo pool is now completely fenced in, with security guards at the entrance and loud music blaring from 10 am - 6 pm daily.

The Flamingo Hotel/Casino begins blaring music from their pool about 10 a.m. every day, and they do not shut it off until about 6 p.m. It's loud, throbbing music with heavy bass that you clearly hear even in your room with the doors closed, because they have big speakers pointed right at the HGVC at the property boundary. The HGVC manager told me that they've unsuccessfully tried to get them to change it. The Flamingo has also erected a fence between the properties, so you have to walk around to an outside entrance and be processed through an airport security type station and get an armband after having your bags searched in order to enter the Flamingo pool area. Before Hilton sold the Flamingo to Harrah's you could just walk into the Flamingo pool area right next to the HGVC, which was very convenient, and then on into the casino.

We booked the Flamingo due to the central location but were very disappointed with the quality and general cleanliness of the public areas and our one bedrom suite. The check in area was clean and failry ok but there the positives ended. We made our way to our room through dirty carpeted corridors that looked as if they hadn't seen a vaccum in months. There was a damp and dirty odour throughout and when we got to our room it was very dark and dingy. We tried to get over the disappointment and unpacked then went for a walk along the strip. Whilst walking back to the suite I decided I would mention my concerns to reception. The gent we spoke to seemed very surprised at my opinion but he did offer to put us in an alternative room, he came with us to show us another room a few floors up but it was exactly the same. I was beginning to feel that our expensive purchse of HGVC points was not rewarding us with good accommodation!!!! I said I wasn't happy with the cleanliness of the rooms, especially the walkways and public areas. The noise from the pool area was alarmingly loud also which was rather annoying. We asked to be transferred to the HGVC on the Strip, the gent was very helpful in organising this for us ao we quickly re-packed and made our way down there. The difference is quite remarkable. I was stunned when we checked in. The building is much newer granted but the quality is far superior and super clean. We were in tower 2 with a fabulous view. Comfy clean beds, lovely lounge, bedroom and bathroom. The fully equipped kitchen was fabulous for keep our drinks cool and for preparing our breakfast and light snacks. Its abit further away from the hustle and bustle of the strip but we used the regular bus for a few dollars for three day ticket. Although we did walk up to the middle of the strip every morning which took about 15 minutes and provided some light excersise too. I can absolutely, without hesitation recommend this hotel if you are looking for something a little quieter and 5* quality.

Highly recommended.\u201d", "Author": "Foxgolf", "ReviewID": "UR108812243", "Content": "My wife and I just got back from a vacation at this location and we had a GREAT time. We are Disney Vacation Club members and exchanged some points through RCI for a week in Vegas. A week in Vegas can be a long time but we had some day trips planned so we thought a week would fly by pretty fast and it did. My wife and I are not real \"needy, pay attention to me\" type of people. The more simple, the better. Our intention for this trip was to relax and enjoy the great weather, see the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam, see some shows, gamble a little bit and spend some quality time around the pool. We were not disappointed with anything we did. If you are reading this review I think the information you want the most is what we thought of this facility so I will address that first. Check in was very easy and fast. We got there early and they were able to get us a room right away. The room was on the 2nd floor which turned out to be perfect as we were able to use the staircase in the main lobby opposed to having to use and wait on the elevator. We then did the \"welcome to the hotel\" spiel and what they were offering for \"the tour/timeshare sales presentation\" was not to our liking so we said \"no\" and that was the end of it with no pressure again to participate which was appreciated. When we arrived in our room we were very pleased with what we saw. We had a one bedroom and there was plenty of room for the two of us. We liked the way it was setup and the decor. As we moved around the rooms we discovered a couple issues and thought it was best to address them immediately. The TV in the living room was not working properly, the safe was locked in a position where we could not use it and there was some food crumbs around the coffee table in the living room. I called the front desk and they were very sorry and offered to move us to another room but we said that was necessary but would like to have the issues fixed and they sent up a maid and a maintenance man within minutes. Everything was taken care of very professionally and the employees were very friendly and apologetic. I was very impressed with this reaction from the staff. We also got a phone call an hour later checking to make sure everything was taken care of to our satisfaction. They even offered us some free credit in the snack shop which we declined as it was no big deal. We never had any other problems at the facility the rest of the vacation. The facility was bigger than I had imagined and was very clean. The pool is in a gated area and it not huge but was very well laid out. Never had any trouble getting chairs and the towels were just inside the gate. There was a small bar where you could get some snacks and drinks which was convenient. The one issue you had if you wanted to get some sun early was the main building blocked the sun at this time of year from hitting the pool area until about 10:30am. We both got early and wanted to hit the sun a little earlier than that so we used the Flamingo pool for this which opened at 9:00am and there usually was a line waiting to get in but it moved pretty fast. The drawback of the Flamingo pool was it was not heated and was pretty cold in my opinion. The HGV pool was a lot smaller but it was heated and I used it numerous times. I found the crowds a lot younger at the Flamingo and a little more our age at the HGV pool area. The music was a little less loud too. The location of the HGV @ the Flamingo was GREAT. It was just a short walk around the Flamingo pool to the Flamingo casino and gift shops (3-4 minute walk and you were on the strip). We elected to not get a car and used the buses (RTC) to get around which worked out perfect. There were stops on both sides of \u201cthe strip\u201d almost right across from the Flamingo which was very convenient. We used the bus system last time we were in Vegas and knew the ropes for getting around. We saw to Cirque shows \"Mystere\" and \"KA\" and really enjoyed both of them. If I was going to see one of them again I would choose \"Mystere\". I'm sure I would see many things that I missed the first time. Show tickets can be a little pricey but they really are worth the money. The day trips we took to the Grand Canyon (south rim) and the Hoover Dam were fantastic. The GC tour took about 14 hours and the HD tour was about 5-6 hours but well worth the time and money. Took the bus to the downtown casinos (Fremont Street) and enjoyed the \u201cFreemont Street Experience \u2013 light show\u201d which was way cool. Well worth the trip to see and watch the people in the crowds which can be a show in itself. In summary, we thought the HGV @ The Flamingo was an excellent facility and hope to visit again in the near future. I would highly recommend it to you and any of my friends. My only negative experience in Vegas is with the people on the sidewalks trying to pass out there prostitution flyers and cards to anyone that walks by them. I never made eye contact with them and pretended they did not exist but it was still a constant annoyance. Unfortunately there is an area out in front of the Flamingo Hotel that they use constantly. If Vegas could get this problem fixed it would make going to Vegas much more enjoyable. Remember \u201cwhat happens in Vegas stays in Vegas\u201d. Have a GREAT trip.

(HGVC-F) Being center strip, having a nice room, and access to nice pools was a must....but we did not want to spend crazy money for the stay either! Finding this location was very easy using our GPS. They have short term self parking up front while you check in and take your bags to your room. The front desk staff was courteous and helpful. They had a room ready for us for early check in as requested but we decided we did not like that room, and opted to wait for a room that was in the main tower, up high, with a straight on view of the pool at the Flamingo. (High room gave us a sliver of a view of the strip towards Paris) We chose The HGVC-F because it had full access to all the pools at the Flamingo, but was a non gaming property. (Yes, they do have access...the reviewer that said this was not the case was wrong...maybe they tried to take their kids to the adult pool?) . The lobby is of acceptable size and welcoming with a breath of fresh air by not having to walk through a smoky casino. The room and bathrooms are nicely appointed and are very roomy. We booked a studio but opted to do a standby upgrade to a 1 bedroom for $19 per night. (If we booked a 1 bedroom it was $39 a night more). Room decoration is warm and they are very well kept. It was worth every penny to upgrade to the 1 bedroom. The room had a living room with sofa bed, kitchen table, full kitchen, washer/dryer, large bathroom, two person whirlpool tub, full shower, king bedroom (fully closed off from rest of suite). The room had plenty of desk space. The bed was very comfortable and the hotel had plenty of TV Channels and flat screen TV's in both the bedroom and living room. Climate control is acceptable and you can leave the blower motor on for white noise while still using the climate control. Absolutely no noise from the nearby strip, but yes you will get noise from the Flamingo pool during the day but it is only from 9am to 6pm so should not be of any consequence, and it is fun to people watch out your window. Regarding housekeeping...there seems to be some confusion on the board.....let me sum it up....if you are staying as part of the timeshare, you do not get daily housekeeping, but if you are booking as a traditional pay customer, you WILL get daily housekeeping. The housekeeping staff did an excellent job of meeting our needs. (Even running the dishwasher daily). Having the full kitchen was great. We did a bit of light shopping on our arrival day so that we could eat a few healthy breakfasts and lunches from our room. There was no charge for in room internet access and the service seemed to work well both in the room and also at the pool. They also nice gym / spa given this is a limited service location. The HGVC brand is a time share that also operates as a hotel/condo rental. Unfortunately there are virtually no HHonors Diamond benefits at this brand other than a few bonus points. (No breakfast, etc.) We knew this coming in and it was not an issue. They gave us a couple of bottles of water when we checked in (no charge) The one negative I will say is that their check out time of 10am is ridiculously early. We were only offered a noon check out as Diamond members and had to push for a later check out. They offered 2pm for $50 (crazy!) and I pushed for no charge and they finally relented after I pointed out this is to be a Diamond benefit, and if they could offer it for $50, they could offer it for free as it was not an availability issue! We were never harassed to attend a time share presentation. They asked us to stop by for a \"welcome gift\" which we skipped....we know that\u2019s just wanting to talk timeshare with us....no thanks. They also left one message in our room and that was it. I understand self parking is free and valet does have a charge. We did not use the parking amenities as we returned our rental car after check in and then just took a taxi to the airport on our final day. The bell desk was excellent at both storing / delivering our luggage on check in, as well as storing our luggage/getting us a cab on check out. Besides the great rooms and non gaming property, the pool scenario was excellent!!! You have the best of both worlds. Full use of the pools at the Flamingo....a short stroll down a nice walkway and the relaxing enjoyable pool at the HGVC-F. The upstairs pool at the Flamingo is a family pool, and the large lower pool is adults only....which is great. We went over to the Flamingo pool in the mornings when they had full sun and the crowds were not too bad. Unfortunately, the pools at the Flamingo are very crowded and the drink / food is over the top expensive. Well...when you have had enough of that....wala, welcome to the private oasis of the HGVC-F pool ONLY for guests of the HGVC-F. This was a very nice, smaller pool with a great hot tub and nice loungers. You did have the full on music from the Flamingo, (which some people may not like) just across the fence, but no crowds. We were able to find loungers either in the sun or shade almost any time. They also have several cabanas and tables (no charge). The pool is really shaded in the morning, but that\u2019s why we went over to the Flamingo Adults pool in the morning. The other cool thing about the pool is that they also allow you to bring in your own food and non alcoholic beverages. (You can bring alcohol in after the bar closes.) Note: No glass containers. They even have barbeque grills where you can grill a steak if you choose. Another great thing, the pool opens on hour before the Flamingo (8am for HGVC-F and 9am for Flamingo) and stays open several hours longer. (10pm for HGVC-F and 6pm for Flamingo) The poolside bar has excellent prices and great service on both food, and drinks (both adult and non adult beverages). Tim the bartender is excellent. If you are lucky enough to be there the days he works (usually Wednesday thru Sunday).....he will take great care of you. Food and drink prices are about half of what the prices are at the Flamingo....awesome! The food and drinks are all very good. Access to the strip is very easy....just go down the walkway to the pool (open 24 hours) and walk along side road past the Flamingo, and next to Bill's Gamblin Hall and there you are. Less than 3 minutes to the strip....This is much faster than walking through the Flamingo. We would stay here again in a heartbeat for our summer trips when we want to have the access to the pools.

We had a nice pool of the pools, and partial views of the strip (Eiffel Tower, Bellagio fountains) and a partial view of the mountains. There were two flat-screen TVs in the unit and the bed and sofabed were very comfortable. Free wi-fi was available. The pools at the Flamingo are great, having just opened for the season during our stay there. HGVC Flamingo quests were allowed to use the Flamingo pools. However, the main pool is now adult only which was a bit of a disappointment but the family-oriented Beach Club is a very nice pool. The private heated year-around HGVC pool was also very nice albeit smaller than the main Flamingo pools. There is also a nice small Fitness Center onsite. The self-park is a bit of walk (maybe 5 minutes) but it is free, had plenty of space right by the elevator, and beats paying for valet parking + tips. At the HGVC Flamingo you are very close to the strip but it is still a bit removed from the noise and activity. Swimming in the HGVC pool in the evenings was very quiet and peaceful.

Our unit was at the end of the hall in the north tower, and we did not share a vestibule with a studio unit. It was very quiet and we never heard other guests in the hall, nextdoor, or above us. We had a nice view of the Flamingo pool, and could see some lights looking up the strip, but most of the strip was obscured by the Flamingo Hotel towers. As other reviews have mentioned, the location is really terrific. From the elevator in our tower (the 3 towers do not connect, except on the 1st floor) we could exit to a service road that we walked up one short block to get to Las Vegas Blvd right at Margaritaville. Or we could walk through the lobby or the pool area, and quickly get to Flamingo Blvd, and the over-street walkways to Caesar\u2019s or Bally\u2019s or Bellagio. Stage Door Liquor was very close, and a good place to buy bottled water and other convenience store-type items. The condo was missing some items when we arrived. There were no coffee filters, no iron or ironing board, and only one dishtowel and no dishrags. I called and someone brought up the coffee filters within about 30 minutes. The other items I noticed later, and left a note for housekeeping on the day of our mid-week maid service, and those items were left in the room for us. I would suggest checking the inventory of the room when you arrive, and requesting any items that are missing, because it\u2019s inconvenient to wait for them when you need them. The hairdryer was really wimpy. The only other criticism I have is that to call the HGVC front desk you have to dial 0, wait for a recording to run through, press 0 again, wait for an answer, and then the Flamingo Hotel operator answers, and you have to ask to be transferred to the HGVC desk. It gets old having to go through this every time you want to ask for the valet to bring your car, or have another question or request. I don\u2019t know why they can\u2019t have their own phone system; it\u2019s certainly a large enough facility to warrant that. The unit was nice, with attractive d\u00e9cor. There was a stacking washer/dryer in a closet, a small galley-style kitchen with stove/oven, microwave, full-sized refrigerator, and dishwasher. Dishes for four. Not a huge amount of counter space, but adequate. Living room had a sofa sleeper (double) and arm chair, coffee table and side table, and a credenza that housed a room safe, DVD player, and a good-sized flat-screen TV. The living area was completed with a built-in upholstered seating bench, a glass-topped rectangular table, and two dining chairs. The king-sized bed had nice sheets and a light-weight down comforter. Another flat-screen TV was atop a chest of drawers, and there was an upholstered chair in the bedroom. The bedroom area was open to part of the bathroom, containing the clothes closet, a sink and large countertop area, and a huge, round, jetted tub. The rest of the bathroom was a pass-through to the entry area, and had another sink and counter area, with a separate toilet and shower room, which could be closed off with a pocket door. This layout made for good traffic flow through the unit. We had a rental car, and rather than self-park (which I think involved a fairly long walk to/from the parking garage) we spent $50 for the all-week valet parking. Add to that the tips every time we took our car out, plus the cost of the car rental, and it really adds up to have a car. We mainly wanted a car so we could visit Hoover Dam and Valley of Fire, but I think for future trips we would skip the car and just walk everywhere. All of the staff were very nice and helpful. After check-in they send you to a \u201cWelcome Desk\u201d which is a code name for \u201ctimeshare promotion desk.\u201d You really could skip this step, but they do give some coupons, and of course offer you free tickets to a show (but not a top-notch show) if you attend a presentation.

When you park you have to go though a maze of elevators and buildings to get to the main buidling, then once inside you have two doors to get to your room.

If they fixed that it would be great. The bed was super comfortable but the pull out couch bed was one of the worst I have ever been on and I have been on a few. The tv was a nice flat screen and you could play dvds which was a plus. Lots of storage and space in the room and it looked out over the pool. The room was super quite which was the best part of it after all the noise on the Strip. Over all the room was great, but would love them to fix the couch and have some privacy for the tub. Security: I felt very safe here as a woman. They had card to get into the elevator and they always had someone at the front desk. Pool: They had a great small pool with the great high quality lounge chairs. The pool bar and grill had everything you needed and the lady who was there was very friendly. Location: It is the center of the strip but behind the Flamingo so it is quite but in the action at the same time. Also it is very close to the monorail which turned out perfect to heading to the conference area. We actually had to walk less then the other people staying at the hotels next the the conference area. It was right next to a little store that you could get alcohol and food. Internet: They do have wireless which a lot of Las Vegas Hotels do not have or you have to pay for, but it is slow. It is fast though if you use it in lobby which is quite and comfortable so that is what I did when I needed to work. Extra: The best part of the hotel was you get to be at a smaller, quite hotel, but had access to all the amenities of the Flamingo hotel. It is like getting your cake and eating it too. You did not have to walk through the smoke filled casino to get to your room, but you could use all of Flamingo hotel like you were staying at it, including the Flamingo pool which seems to be the best on the strip. Also we had dinner at the buffet in the Flamingo and I was surprised how good it was. It has lots of variety and I loved there dumplings. We had a great view too.", "Date": "October 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "lowestoft", "Title": "\u201cFriendly quiet oasis in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip\u201d", "Author": "tubby75", "ReviewID": "UR79547771", "Content": "After a 11 hour flight and car rental pick up we eventually found the hotel, its not clearly visible like the bigger hotels on the strip. it's tucked behind The Flamingo. We were greeted by friendly valet staff who offered help with our bags and introduced themselves. At check in we were helped by Ricardo and another young lady (very pretty dark curly hair) they offered us ice cold water which was lovely, generally asked where we were from etc, sorted our room they didn't have a high room available at the time (i like a view) but they assured us that on would be ready within an hour. i can't praise the customer service enough with this hotel. When we got to the room we were very impressed, separate bedroom, whirlpool bath, roomy shower and fully equipped kitchen we don't cook on holiday but having the fridge and bits was so handy. The room was spotless and trust me i'm a clean and neat freak. It met all my fussy standards. The pool area is so nice. The staff at the bar called us by our names and were very helpful with iced water etc. There was always plenty of lounges and the towels were soft and clean. Staying at this hotel you have access to the Flamingo Pool, we are only in our thirtes but we found it very busy and over crowded and were more than happy to relax in the hilton pool. There is music played in the flamingo pool and yes you can hear it but i kinda liked it. The small deli in the hotel was great again staff very friendly, excellent breakfast snacks and coffee, and they also do light salads which were yummy. Made a change from the excess buffets that were about. We used valet and it was always quick and prompt you could ring down from your room, this way your car is cooling with the A/C when you get down. This is a timeshare condo hotel but we never got the chat 'would we be interested' there was a message left on the phone, we didn't reply and no more was mentioned. I got a weeks stay here through the disney vacation club but we met other british folk in the hotel who simply just booked through the website. I really can't stress enough how great this hotel is. We visited all the 'brand' hotels on the strip and i can honestly say that i would rather stay here. Vegas is all about excess and the other hotels seem overcrowded with tourists and i loved that although i could enjoy all the casinos and bars in the other hotels then i could escape at the end of the evening to the hilton. I don't think the bellagio front desk would say good morning to you personally by your name each morning. If you want to enjoy all what Las Vegas has to offer but would also like abit of down time this is the place for you. I have said to so many of my friends that it was fantastic.

I still had a lot of unanswered questions, so I am mainly going to answer the questions I had hoping the information will be of value to others too. This is a very nice property and well deserving of the high TA rating. This was the first time I stayed at a non casino hotel in Vegas. I never saw more than one or two people waiting at the front desk, which is totally different than the check in experience at many casino hotels. Also different is after we finished checking in we were sent to talk to the welcome lady, who is just trying to get people to commit to listening to the time share presentation. When I run into those people on the street I am very short. Because I was checking into the hotel I was trying to be polite, but after about the 3rd time she asked me why I wouldn't waste a morning listening to a high pressure sales pitch I lost my patience. So you might as well be rude right off the bat and save yourself some time. You won't get away from her any other way. If you book thru a time share you are an \"owner\" and if you book thru Hilton you are a \"renter\". The reviews on this forum lead me to believe there would not be daily maid service, which is true if you are a time share owner. But, because we booked thru Hilton and were renters we did have daily maid service and coffee packs were replenished daily. I had already checked in the deli and they were charging $2.29 for one coffee pack, so I am glad it was included in my room rate. The deli kind of ticked me off in that prices were not listed on most items. I asked about a 6 pack of bottled water and it was $ 7.50, no thank you. Some of the food was reasonably priced though, with muffins at $2.09 and breakfast sandwiches at about $3.29. If you have a car go to Von's or Albertson's for water, soda and snacks. We had a studio suite, which was spacious enough, but the kitchenette was crammed in a very small area with little counter space. The only sitting area was across the suite, not next to the kitchen area. We heard no noise except when people came out of the adjoining room. The doors slam very loud. I believe all suites face the Flamingo pool. There are only rooms on one side of the hallway. When you walk down the hallway you look out windows on one side and the rooms are all on the other side. There are three towers connected only at the ground floor. The check in desk and deli are in the center of the largest tower, which is the west tower. The HGV pool entrance and self parking garage are closer to the north tower. The Flamingo self park garage is across from the south tower. Valet parking is $10.00 per day. If you self park you can use the HGV reserved lot, which is across the street and down a short way from the north tower. It has an elevator. You can also park in the Flamingo self parking garage, which we did a few nights. I think it is more convenient, but there are only stairs near the exit across from the south tower. To use an elevator in the Flamingo lot you would have to go to the far end of the parking garage, away from the HGV. I parked on the 3rd floor near the HGV and walked down. The entrance to either garage is off Audrie Lane or Winnick Av. If you are driving and unfamiliar with the area I highly recommend you look at google street view to get your bearings. Winnick Ave runs directly under the monorail track, so that is a good landmark to use. Many of the reviews on this forum are written by travelers who came with children, so I was a little concerned about noise, etc., but we were not bothered at all. The walk to the Flamingo and on to the Strip was pleasant. You walk along the fence by the Flamingo pool for just 2 or 3 minutes and you are at the casino. It was dark at night, but there are security guards and cameras around. We even ran into a couple of guards on bikes riding thru the HGV parking garage one night. This is a great center Strip location. A car is convenient to get groceries and we wanted it to get to the Wisconsin/UNLV football game, but this is a great location if you won't have a car.

I was told, that HGV maintains ALL properties to the SAME standards and I was told, YES that there is housekeeping services.

We all really liked the room, both the King bed and sofa bed were comfy. LOVED the two person jet tub!!!! Nice touch to supply starbucks coffee packets for the coffee maker. Right after check in we walked down to the Venitian (took 30 min due to lots of ped traffic). Got our tickets for 7:00 show for the Blue Man Group. As an FYI, we bought those tickects on our Alligant Airways Flight. Only paid $69 each for the \"good seats\" but we were actually seated in the \"great seats\" and got to meet the guys after the show, with only 5 other people. It was a great show and very family friendly. While at the Venitian, we ate at the Grand Lux Cafe (very good and reasonably priced) and we did a gondala ride (so so experience for the price). Had breakfast sandwiches and bagels from the on HGVC site cafe our first morning. Ok prices and tasted pretty good. There is a small store right next to the hotel that has better prices. For reasonable prices,drive or take a taxi to Albertsons or Safeway which are both nearby but off the strip. We heard from several people that Batistas, the Italian resturant right next door is very good and reasonably priced although we didn't try it. The vallet guys were very nice and good at getting us taxi's quickly. Thursday we saw Cirque du Solei KA at MGM (got discounted tickets on Ebay). Excellent show,highly recommend but probably not good for kids 10 and under as there is a plot to follow. Ate at Rainforest Cafe at MGM. Good food and fun atmosphere. Friday we ate at Hash House A-go-go at Imperial Palace. VERY good food and great prices, close to HGVC. Also did the Effiel Tower.

It's further up the Strip than where I usually stay (somewhere near MGM Grand) -- but we found the location to be prime for venturing up toward the Fashion Show Mall, the Wynn, and further than I'd be able to comfortably get from the MGM. Realize the Strip is extremely long, there is a lot of walking, but with Caesar's right across the street, you really can't go wrong here. The service was incredible. From the front desk, to housekeeping, to the bellmen and everyone else, we were always greeted, smiled at, everything was impeccably clean. Our room was beautiful; a one-bedroom in the North Tower with a huge jacuzzi tub, beautiful bathroom, living area and kitchen. My only two gripes about the room were that (1) housekeeping apparently only comes once per week, which I find to be too little -- we arrived on Saturday and they cleaned on Tuesday, which left us with a mess from Tuesday on; (2) the shower water was seldom hot enough. In any event, we had a washer-dryer, a fully equipped kitchen, our room was immaculate and even I, a germophobe, was happy sleeping in the bed, in the sheets, walking barefoot in the room. The hotel has a cute little cafe, and they have amazing coffee if you like it strong. The patio area is great, the pool is cute and they have quite a few amenities. You do have to carry your key around all the time to get into the building, to use the elevator, etc; I had never seen that before, or noticed it, but apparently it is the status quo for timeshare properties. I'd be very happy to go back here, to be honest. This is a beautiful hotel, and the staff made a huge difference.

Don't try to walk through the Flamingo to get to the HGVC at night. Just don't do it. The best is to just walk all the way down the street between the Flamingo and O'Sheas. Be careful as there is not always a sidewalk down this street.) There was free parking in the Flamingo parking deck. Check in was easy. (I won't repeat what the other reviewers mentioned about the amenities.) It's the little things that made our stay. We checked in on my husband's birthday. That evening, we were brought a staff signed card and a little snack gift with three balloons festively tied to it. It was a very sweet gesture and it made my husband's day! We also liked the layout of the suite. Past the main door of the suite led to a little foyer with two doors, one leading to a studio bedroom, one leading to the one bedroom suite. This is different from other HGVC muliple bedroom suites in that it provided a little more privacy. Because my parents had different plans in Vegas than my husband and I, we were able to come and go without waking the other couple (as my parents were early risers and we were the late-nighters!) Kitchen was invaluable for making egg breakfasts. Although we had a car from the first leg of our vacation, we left it parked in the deck and seldom used it.

Had a one bedroom villa on a RCI Exchange, and was looking for a restful stay. The kitchen area was very nice, but the light switches made no sense at all, in most cases you had to walk through a dark room to turn on a light! The bedroom was shared by a partial bathroom with a soaking tub. Okay for folks that want to soak and then run to bed, but I prefer seperate rooms for bathing. The sleeper sofa was hard as a boulder, and just about as comfortable. But I did enjoy the breakfast nook treatment for dining. To get anywhere within the resort you had to walk out through the pool area of the Flamingo, but the garden areas with wild life was fun. My major complaint came on the afternoon before my early moring departure. The Flamingo Hotel and Casino was having a private \"Pool Party\", and the management of the Grand Vacations Club informed everyone that there might be some noise. At 4:20PM the sound checks started. My room was shaking from the vibrations. Really. I felt the windows and walls, and could feel the movement. I decided it was not going to get any better so walked down to talk to the folks at the front desk. They said there was nothing they could do, and the music would probably stop around midnight. I asked to speak to a manager, and the assistant manager came out and was sympathetic to my objections. But there was nothing to be done, this happens every now and then, and they have no say over the noise. I could not even watch television because I could not hear it over the non-stop band outside. I had to get up at 4:00AM, and by midnight I was exhausted and upset. Earplugs, pillows over the head, nothing worked. I finally dragged sofa cushions onto the floor in the hallway, directly under the air conditioning vent to try to block out the pounding so I could sleep.

We chose this hotel base on other travelers opinions and we wanted to be in a hotel that did not have the noise and foot traffic of a casino hotel. This was a perfect fit for our needs. We booked a suite since it was just a short stay. The room was very clean and comfortable, overlooking the pool. I liked that the Hilton pool was much smaller and quieter than the Flamingo. Although there was no music at our pool, they cranked up the volume so high at the Flamingo pool that there was no problem hearing it. We never had a problem finding lounges at the pool, in fact, each day we were able to get a cabanna, since we prefer the shade. The pool bar service is friendy and relatively inexpensive. The deli carries almost everything you need for a short stay and the kitchenette in the studio is sufficient for 2 days. If you are staying for a week, I would recommend a 1 BR with a full kitchen so you would have more room and cooking options. The bathroom was updated, nice jetted tub and a separate toilet/shower room. Bed was comfortable as were the pillows. Hotel staff was vey helpful and friendly. I used the treadmill in the fitness center on Sunday. The fitness center is very clean, it has all the basic things you need/want for your workout while on the road. Towels and water are provided also. There is another small spa inside next to the fitnss center as well as a sauna. There is no charge to use any of these facilities. There were a few shortcomings; 1) there was no dish washing soap in the kitchen. I don't mind doing my own dishes, but I don't want to spend the money in the deli for a large dish detergent that I won't use but a few drops and is too large to carry-on in my suitcase. 2) is that there was no make-up mirror in the bathroom. 3) As someone else on this site mentioned, the room has a main door and then 2 doors off the small foyer. The main door is very heavy and \"loud\" when it closes. Fortunately, there was no one in the room next to us, or I'm sure they would have been really irritated at our coming and going. These are minor things, just a bit irritating, but nothing to detract from my recommendation to family/friends or to keep me from returning.

The pool is small but quiet and relaxing with a full bar and misters. The Flamingo pool, which Hilton guests have full access to is a very crowded, mostly young scene. It is nice to be able to choose between the two pools. On weekdays the Go Pool at the Flamingo is not at all crowded. There is loud music and a bar with plenty of free lounges. It is $10 for men to get in and bikini tops are optional. There were very few who went topless. The small mini-mart and deli at the Hilton is convenient and has good Starbucks espresso drinks. The center strip location is excellent! It is a short walk over LV Blvd to Cesars and Bellagio. THe Venetian also isn't too bad a walk. To walk much further in the summer Vegas heat isn't fun. We took the monorail from Flamingo/HGVC a lot. There is an elevator right to the monorail stop outside the main lobby of Hilton or there's a bridge that goes from the Flamingo alongside the pool area to the monorail.

When we arrived there was coffee etc in our room. Bathroom amenities were shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and soap, all replaced daily. We booked a King bed studio room and this was very spacious and ideal for us. As there is so much to do in LV you don't spend much time in your room. The room had a large jacuzzi bath and wash hand basin open onto main area with a separate shower and WC. Maid service was excellent, though their duties don't include washing / drying of dishes. The pool area is not very big but still very pleasant. Guests can also use the Flamingo pool and although this was much bigger it was always extremely busy and very noisy. There is a deli on the ground floor where you can buy all basic essentials. We preferred to go to the nearby grocery store, 2 minute walk from the front door of the hotel. Here prices were cheaper. e.g. bottle of wine was $13 instead of $20 at the deli, water was $1 instead of $3. There are 2 computers available for guest use, at a small charge. All staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a perfect location, only 2 minute walk to the Strip. We took a taxi to Premium outlets, $16 - 20. Taxi to airport was $16.

The apartment was comfortable and well equipped (eg well stocked kitchen, coffee machine, useful washer and dryer). Our room was refurbished room and not at all pink which was a relief!

I had a studio room on the 16th floor. the room was very spacious. I enjoyed having a small fridge, microwave and coffee maker. there is an excellent whirlpool bath set up - there is a large opening between the bathtub and the main room, so you can have a good soak and watch TV if you want. There is a separate private shower and toilet area. The TV was a flat screen of decent size (42\" ?) and the channel selection was good. service was good - daily maid service and friendly staff all around. Small grocery store and deli on the premises was useful, fair prices and good food and excellent coffee. What really makes this place special is its location. It is at the backside of the Flamingo Hotel, and all the rooms overlook the Flamingo's expansive tropical pool grounds. You can use the flamingo pool (good for kids) if you want to hang with the crowd, or you can use the HGVC's small pool and hot tub. I chose to use the HGCV pool as the flamingo pool had all of the sunny chairs taken. There were kids in teh HGVC pool and they seemed to enjoy it. An earlier post on this site refers to the HGVC chairs all being \"reserved\" first thing in the morning. As far as I can tell, what really happens is that staff puts a rolled up towel on each chaise first thing in the morning and they are not being held for anyone. Great little pool bar too with reasonable prices. The grounds immediately adjacent to the hotel are a nice place to have coffee in the morning. I used the monorail to get to the convention center each day. The monorail is right behind the HGVC. It is a little convoluted to get to it as you have to exit the Flamingo pool, enter the Flamingo, and then backtrack along the monorail walkway. Not too far and the monorail comes at least every 10 minutes. I also found a really good pizza place in the Flamingo, over by the actual flamingo (the birds) exhibit. I got take out so I could watch a movie in my room and have a pizza and a couple of cold beers. Speaking of beer, I found a small microbrewery place in the Flamingo too - with stout on tap, which seems to be pretty hard to find in this town. The strip is readily accessible through the Flamingo hotel. I found it enjoyable to walk the strip and then take the monorail back and vice-versa. I would recommend the HGVC for business travelers as it is quiet and they have free internet access and can print your boarding passes. I would also recommend this for families, though I can't really imagine bringing my kids to Vegas. The Flamingo pool is the big family draw and the HGVC provides access to excellent pools and the all the Vegas sites without having to expose your kids to really drunk 20-somethings. I am not giving the HGVC five stars because it is not a five star hotel. However, it is a solid four star in my book. I've stayed at the Golden Nugget (a four-start hotel), which is a low four star in my book, and the HGVC room and service quality are better. It just doesn't have all the bells and whistles (restaurants, nightlife, spa etc.) that must be required to be a four-star. Not all was perfect and I have a few pet peeves. Bed was hotel standard - not one of those dream beds you get in some places. Nice down comforter and pillows though. Couch was a twin fold-out, and I find fold-out couches to be uncomfortable to sit on. I would have much preferred a good solid leather chair or two but I guess they are going for maximizing the guest bed potential. The TV is always pre-tuned to the commercial for the HGVC membership, which wouldn't be too annoying but the volume preset is too loud. The DVD player is a great touch, but the DVD rental kiosk downstairs was busted so I was at the mercy of TBS. On business trips I like to splurge for the overpriced new releases on demand and I was looking forward to watching the new Bond movie, but the HGVC doesn't offer on-demand and the DVD kiosk selection, when working, is limited. The room shares a private foyer with the adjacent one-bedroom condo. The foyer door is keyed too which is nice if you want to rent out the whole two bedroom set-up for a larger group. However, both the foyer door and the two split unit doors close really loud, and on my last night my new neighbors were coming and going from 11PM to midnight (they had friends in another unit, had just gotten in and were situating - yup I heard all their conversations in the foyer) and the loud doors kept me awake. I could not hear their conversations once they went into their room. The key positive to me was the grounds - being able to sit outside and relax surrounded by vegetation and no crowds. I could not find any other hotel on my strip wanderings that offered such a relaxing outdoor area. They all seem to focus on the indoors, or close their pool areas at 5 (nice move for business people), or are so crowded as to not be relaxing. So, if you are still bothering to read this rather lengthy review, I hope this has been of help in making your decision. It is a mellow hotel and is a good choice for mellow people.", "Date": "March 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Service": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis/St Paul", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location!\u201d", "Author": "joceylou", "ReviewID": "UR26278746", "Content": "My father allowed me use of his timeshare at the Hilton Grand Vacation at the Flamingo March 7-14, 2009.

We were the first ones in a newly renovated 2 bedroom suite. 42\" flat screen tvs in the living room and studio and a smaller flat screen on the wall of the master bedroom. All upgraded granite counters. New furniture. Everything was great. Both rooms had jacuzzi tubs and separate showers. The new shower heads had no pressure adjustments and stung when you used them. If they had a way of turning down the water pressure or using an adjustable head, I think it would have been better. The only other thing that I would prefer they changed is the old 1970 hotel style heating and cooling. The temperature gauge went from cool to heat. Then there is the switch for low, medium and high fan and another switch for low, medium and off. I would prefer a thermostat with a temperature setting that allows the fan to turn off, but otherwise it functioned fine.

Used the free parking just off the hotel and was not a problem at all and saved $8 per day on valet. There was always a space in garage reserved for HGVC guests. Hotel staff was just fabulous, and friendly. Deli in hotel was small but had great food and coffee (starbucks). Kept the coffee cup as refills were much less expensive. Rented a car and had easy access to the main roads in each direction. ie..30 min to Hoover, 4.5 hours to South rim, 35 min. to Red Rock Canyon...etc.. Did not use the monorail as it seemed quite pricey and walking the strip was very easy as long as you have good sneakers. Saw Spamalot and Ka and walked both ways to each show. Would recommend both but get twofers at Travelzoo or someplace else. Was at HGVC with two teenage boys and they both enjoyed the place also. Played tennis and enjoyed the pools on off travel days. I think they are closing around July 1 for renovations but we loved our room with the full kitchen, washer/dryer, BLENDER, etc.....would highly recommend this hotel for anyone...price was right also.", "Date": "April 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Catonsville, MD", "Title": "\u201cClose to Everything, and Good for Your Money\u201d", "Author": "JPuppy1234", "ReviewID": "UR13794559", "Content": "This is a wonderful place to stay at.

I was told this is one of their original properties, purchased around 1994. It is on the grounds of the Flamingo Las Vegas. However, we discovered that they are no longer affiliated in any way. Hilton has a much newer, nicer property at the north end of the strip, but you can't beat this one's location. It is on the strip behind the Flamingo which is next to Bally's and Paris and across the street from Caeser's and Bellagio. Check-in was good, however the parking for HGVC is actually about a five to ten minute walk to the Flamingo's employee garage which has NO ELEVATOR'S, and guests can only park on level three or higher (because this is the employee garage for the Flamingo). It would have been nice to have been told this by the check-in desk. Do yourself a favor and drop you bags off at your room first if you're parking a car. And be careful because the walk is behind the Flamingo on an access road that doesn't always have a sidewalk. Imagine walking in the street in Vegas with luggage while delivery trucks and taxi's speed by. It is the most ridiculous parking situation I've ever seen -- but it's free! The HGVC has it's own pool/jacuzzi area which is separate from the Flamingo. This is a good thing as the Flamingo pool area was always extremely crowded with hundreds of people and lots of kids (as well as really murky, cloudy water). The HGVC has a deli/market open until 10pm with a pretty extensive variety of items. Think of it as a cross between a small convenience store and Starbucks. It also serves breakfast sandwiches, wraps, subs, and pizza. And if you're an owner you get a 10% discount on all purchases. Our unit was a one bedroom apartment. On the plus side, it was a good size and was extremely clean. On the negative side, the decor was obviously inspired by the Flamingo in the early 90's and has a Golden Girls pink/green theme. The stove and microwave in the kitchen were functional, but old. The bathroom was enormous, with an extremely large jacuzzi tub that easily fit two people. However, the sinks and tub were very dated. My biggest complaint was the sofa in the living room was very old and had multiple stains. I have one complaint in terms of service --- the binder in your rooms that explains \"owner\" benefits include a 10% discount at all restaurants at the adjoining Flamingo Las Vegas as well as any Flamingo Las Vegas logo items from their gift store. As I mentioned earlier, the Flamingo and HGVC are no longer affiliated in any way and the Flamingo did not honor this 10% discount AT ALL. I brought this to the attention of someone at the check-in desk and she shrugged her shoulder's and said, \"Yeah, it's real hit or miss. The manager is trying to work something out with them. You can fill out a comment card if you want\". I told her it was not the fact that the Flamingo wasn't honoring it, it was the fact that the binder in my room says they are! Change the binders if you no longer have an agreement! I realize this is not a huge issue, but it irked me. Overall, this property is for you if you are interested in a central location on the strip. It's clean and spacious and the staff were (overall) extremely friendly and helpful.

We stayed here for a week through an RCI exchange. This was just an OK experience. Stayed at other 'resorts' and had better times - Loved past stay at the Mandalay Bay on the Strip! Arrived in Las Vegas and rented a car since we planned to go out and about to sight see (Hoover Dam - Lake Mead - etc). Self parking is free - valet parking for the week is $30 - plus your wait time. The property is located behind the Flamingo Casino (Hilton Flamingo... Hilton GVC...). Walking distance to Bally's, Harrah's, Bellagio etc. If you want to go along the Strip and see the various casino's - purchase a 24-hour monorail ticket ($9) since there is a station connected at the Flamingo. Monorail runs from MGM to the Sahara. There is a separate monorail that runs from the Excalibur to Mandalay Bay. Reserved a 2 bedroom unit which turned out to be a 'Master Unit Room' and general 'hotel room' attached. This composed of two bedrooms (king beds) with TVs, w/a DVD or VCR and a sleeper sofa, two hot tubs (a single and double), two shower stalls, small kitchen, dining table, sleeper sofa and living room area with a TV. Beds were super firm, basic 'hotel' type bedding - nothing dreamy or super fluffy about them. Couch had minor stains from leftovers. Walls were dirty with handprints and food stains in the kitchen. Dishwasher, coffee makes, toaster, etc. Sub par cleaning performed or at least to my personal cleaning standards. Room overlooked the pool and faced Bally's. Towels in unit are basic hotel towels - nothing fluffy or luxury about them. Elevator had foul order. Washer dryer in the unit is super small efficiency type. Two shirts, two shorts and maybe a pair of undergarments was pushing it's capacity. HGVC provides dish soap, single use laundry soap box, 2 -1oz coffee packets, 2 dishwasher packets, bathroom soaps and shampoo/conditioners, 1 paper towel roll. Nice touch. The staff were very nice. Registration Desk - Welcome Desk - Concierge - bellhops - pool bar staff - etc - everyone was very very nice. The picture of the resort is shot looking from the Flamingo Casino looking though landscaped trees into the Hotel court yard - pool area. You register behind all this off the drive up entrance to the Flamingo next to an alleyway. The HGVC has it's own pool (only 4 feet deep), a 15 person hot tub outside and a 8 person indoor tub. Small hotel size workout facility. Guest also have the usage of the Flamingo pool and grounds. The Flaming has a very large pool (3.5 - 4 feet deep only), life guards, has a kids slide at one end, a separate European sunbathing area - adults only & a pair of tennis courts. About the pool area - When we were there, adults would go down to the HGVC pool starting around 6am to reserve Cabana's (there is a total of 5 available - they have fans and water-misters) and chairs. Very annoying since it was the same families time after time. I complained to the pool staff and had their items removed from the Cabana since the family left for the other Flamingo pool for over 2 hours while leaving their item within the cabana. A lot of kids, a lot of teenagers and young adults. Loud music plays at both pools. Heavy smoking going on around the pools too.. since the HGVC is non-smoking inside. 2nd hand smoke all around the pool. Parents at times put their kids - in diapers - into the pool - GROSS! When we were their - a child (4/5) swallowed too much pool water and puked his lunch into the pool. Hence it was shut down and needed to be cleaned for the day... There is a small deli on site - good food at a nice price. There is a pool bar, $5 for weak drinks though.
