One 'room' had two Queen beds, and the other (the parent's room) had one Queen bed, and each had a TV. It also had a little fridge and microwave, which is good when you have kids. It was only a few blocks to watch the Thanksgiving Day Parade (and the balloon inflating thing the night before is on the same street - 77th), and there was a great pub with microbrewed beers on 76th and Amsterdam (the Amsterdam Ale House), which served a Thanksgiving dinner for us un-American tourists.

If Broadway is too busy then Amsterdam and Columbus are close at hand. Staff were very helpful at check in and again any time we had a request. When my wife found the hairdryer was missing one was delivered to the room in minutes. House keeping was good and every one we spoke to was friendly. Our room was a decent size a for New York hotel and very comfortable but here come the quirks. There was an old fashioned cast iron radiator which could take 10/15 minutes to warm up and then roasted us and likewise the shower sometimes needed to be run for 5 minutes before providing hot water. Let me be clear these did not cause real problems but did need a little adjustment. I was reminded of my stays in Scottish hotels rather than American ones. Our other problem was no coffee maker in our room - a first for us in America. Now there was excellent free coffee in the lobby but this was only available 7am-4pm. Arriving in to our room about 5pm after a hectic day in NY a reviving cup of tea or coffee would have been welcome. The lobby itself opened directly on to the street and in January was freezing and had limited seating but there were free newspapers.

This hotel was a lovely, older style boutique hotel in a great location. Everything was well appointed and clean. That said, it was a cold, January weekend in NYC and our room and bathroom were freezing cold! The hotel had an old radiator, steam heating system, but the windows definitely need to be replaced as freezing cold air was literally blowing in from the windows in our room and bathroom, completely negating any heat offered by the room's radiator. After complaining the first night, the hotel staff sent up a space heater, which, unfortunately did little to combat the cold air drafting in through the windows. It was obvious that other guests were experiencing the same problem, based on conversations at the front desk, and the evidence of several space heaters left by maid service at the elevator areas after servicing checkout rooms. After a second complaint, the front desk sent a mainteance man up to our room. He shared that he was busy with many calls for cold rooms. He actually lowered our bedroom window and draped a blanket over it and shoved it closed and then stuffed extra towels along the base of the window. Unfortunately this did little to stop the draft whistling in from the sides of the bedroom window. We then confiscated another space heater from the hallway, and when 2 space heaters wouldn't warm our room sufficiently, we finally marched down to the lobby and registered a \"face-to-face\" complaint. The staff offered to move us to another, warmer room, and after trying several new rooms with them, we finally settled on a somewhat \"warmer\" room and moved all of our belongings (and one of our space heaters) to the new room. What a pain, although all the activity did help to warm us up! After spending the day out and about in NYC in the freezing cold temperatures, we returned to our new, warmer room to find the radiator completely cold and the room quite chilly! Fortunately, we still had the space heater, which we literally had to run constantly to remain confortable, even throughout our sleeping hours, which I wasn't real happy about. Our room radiator did actually spring to life and give off sufficient heat one time, when it awakend us with it's clangs and clunks at 6:08 a.m. Unfortunately that was the first and last time the thing gave off any heat during the remainder of our stay. Topping off all of this was the fact that I blew a circuit in our room when I turned on the hair dryer the next morning, and plunged our room into total darkness, because the space heater and hair dryer apparently caused an overload. After fumbling in the dark, I was able to locate the phone and call the front desk. They hustled a serviceman up and he reset the breaker and I was able to continue drying my hair, without the space heater running. While we were checking out, we voiced our dissatisfaction with the heating system, and were offered a meal voucher, which we turned down as we were heading out of town. During our checkout, another couple were voicing the same complaint to the other desk clerk. My advice regarding this hotel would be to book it only in mild weather months and to be sure to ask for a room with a working radiator!!", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "williamsburg, va", "Title": "\u201cA great place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "jlullman", "ReviewID": "UR123736310", "Content": "We just stayed for 5 nights of theater and sightseeing!

We booked through expedia, and got a good deal. When arriving at 3am to be told our room had been subject to a minor flood our hearts sank... The reception staff were friendly and ensured we had an alternative room available, but only for one night whilst they resolved our room. The room we were given was the smallest I had ever stayed in - I mean smaller than university accommodation!! Needless to say we were both tired, and at least the bed was comfortable. The next day we went for breakfast (over the road), which was nice and we met some fellow tourists who advised on their trips so far. After then, we decided to go for a walk at Central Park, which is only 5mins away from the hotel. Upon our return to the hotel our luggage was moved and we entered our new room... To our surprise and satisfaction, the room was lovely and really big, which made up for the night before - therefore upgrade your room, plus ask for a room facing broadway. This is when our holiday really started. Admittedly some maintenance was going on on the rooms around us, but the workmen didn't start drilling or making any noise until we were up - i.e. when they heard the TV or when I went to the gym or grabbed a coffee from the foyer. I workout every day, so chose the hotel as it had a gym. Although it was small, I only ever saw one other person in there apart from my wife and I, so it doesn't feel too crammed. There are 2 treadmills, x-trainers and bikes, some free-weights (max 50lbs dumbbells), so no heaving lifting possible. The multi-gym equipment is in need of some oiling, as it was very sticky, so injuries are possible if you don't exercise properly. I would recommend the hotel purchases a bar for guests to use either on a bench or elsewhere - it does't' have to be olympic standard!! The staff were friendly, especially the doormen (as we called them). We wanted to have a special meal for our wedding anniversary, so asked the hotel for recommendations and we were surprised that the Italian they recommended provide guests of the hotel with a 30% discount. The restaurant had very friendly staff and the food was the best we ate out there. Being on 77th, unless you have your walking shoe's on, it is a good 20mins walk to Times Square, and add another 20-30mins to catch the ferry to the statue of liberty. We used a taxi once and a bus once for the experience and to save our feet from throbbing too much... Do not pay for the \"super shuttle\" - taxi transfers between JFK and the hotel are the same price, so to save you waiting for the minibus, being crammed in and potentially being the last to be dropped off...I would sort out transfers upon arrival. There are loads of taxi's outside!

I will start with the few positive things that this hotel has going for it. First the location. This is the main reason why I picked the Belleclaire. The Upper West Side is a great place to stay in NYC if you are looking for a more neighborhood feel away from the hustle and bustle. Also the Belleclaire is clean. Now for the negative. Upon arrival we requested an early check in as we had an early flight and would love to have taken a nap. We expressed that we certainly understood if they could not accommodate this but would appreciate it if they could put in a request. The woman at the front desk told us she would definitely put in the request. After venturing out for a few hours we called the hotel to see if they were able to check us in early. We spoke to the same woman who checked us in. Not only did she not even remember speaking to us she never even put in the request. We booked a deluxe queen room and the size of the room was decent. I don't expect much when it comes to the size of the room in NYC. You pretty much have to expect it to be small. But the room was certainly functional and clean. Those were the only good things about this room. The hallways are so narrow and the walls are so thin that we could hear the people speaking and yelling ACROSS the hall not to mention the baby who was crying all day and night in the room next to us. The hotel did not inform us that there was construction going on in the hotel. We woke up to hammering and pounding everyday at 8am. Our bed was like a rock. Actually a rock is probably more comfortable. The pillows were even worse. They have really let this hotel become run down. All of our furniture was severely damaged and there were large holes in all the sheets, pillow cases and duvet cover. Luckily we only needed to use the air conditioner one night during our trip. After turning it on we soon found out there was no hope in sleeping with it on. It was the loudest air conditioner I have ever experienced. So we had no choice but to turn it off. We thought we would finally get some relief from the noise. We were wrong. It continued to rattle even when it was turned off and unplugged! How is it possible that an air conditioner can continue to be noisy when it is unplugged! This was officially the hotel from hell. The hotel advertises free wifi but it rarely if ever works. We had a total of 12 tv channels. No I did not come to NYC to watch television but if I am paying $2000+ for a room I should have that option. We truly felt as if we were staying in a low budget motel. The only thing that reminded us that it wasn't was how much it cost. If at any point during your trip you would like to sleep or feel comfortable I recommend not staying at the hotel Belleclaire.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northport, New York", "Title": "\u201cCharming and great location!\u201d", "Author": "Perez303", "ReviewID": "UR119221470", "Content": "Our experience was wonderful at the Belleclaire.

We arrived in New York at 12am but as with most places, this hotel is open 24 hours so check in was no problem. We were greeted with a smile and a New York hello by the doormen and given the keys to our room. Our room was pretty small, just a queen bed, a small fridge, a large tv, a desk and an aircon. We opted for the shared bathroom and we had no problem with this as it saved us money and we never once ran into the other group of people using our bathroom. The room was, although small, perfect for us because when you're in NY who spends their time in the hotel room? We used it for sleeping at that was it! We travelled to NY during the heat wave and boy did we need that aircon! It worked perfectly and actually got to 15 degree Celsius unlke many aircons in australia. The elevators were a bit slow but that can be expected from such an old building. The only fault I can give is that on one occasion my partner was seriously ill and she required doctor attention. After running down to ask the manager I was greeted with a response as though he didnt take us seriously or was thinking 'typical tourist', Nonetheless, he gave me some information about how expensive a doctor would be but he seemed like he wasnt concerned to help. The location of the hotel is perfect! It used to be right across the road from the Manhattan Diner, which we must say is the most amazing diner we ate at. Everythnig was tasty and the service was outstanding. The first few days we walked to time square from the Hotel and it takes about 20 minutes for us, taking in the sites along the way. However, the 1 train goes straight to time square and takes 5 minutes. This elaves from 79th street, 2 blocks north.

Walk over to Amsterdam or Columbus for a great selection of restaurants such as \u202aGina La Fornarina Restaurant\u202c or cappuccinos and pastries at Bomboloni or walk up the street to Zabars. And down below on Broadway are 24 hour markets with a great selection of food and beverages. Lincoln Center is a nice walk away (I made this walk several times a day for a week) from the hotel, and there are 2 subway stops close by - one a couple blocks towards uptown but I much preferred the walk to the 72nd Street Subway station. The Belleclaire is a wonder bargain for the price and the location and it's a very warm and friendly place to stay -- I'd highly recommend it to anyone!", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brookline, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cUnpleasant\u201d", "Author": "greybeardboston", "ReviewID": "UR118292173", "Content": "We recently spent a night at the Belleclair.

We booked the 'deluxe queen room'. I will try here to give a very unbiased review so, I will go over the positive and the negative of this experience: 1. There was nothing deluxe about the deluxe queen room. The room was extremely small and very dark (picture is taken in the middle of a sunny day). The room had a very bad smell to it so we went over everything to see where is it coming from. This allowed us to see that the mattress and linens were all clean and mattress was actually new. We located the smell to be coming from the air conditioner, turned it off and reported it to the front desk. Air conditioner was a window air conditioner supported in its place by some kind of foam. Front desk staff was really very responsive and sent an engineer to look at it immediately. We had to leave the room so we did not know that fixing it did not work until the evening. We were exhausted after a busy day in New York so, instead inquiring for another room we decided to just turn the air conditioner off and open the window. The window was extremely dirty with sticky tape all over it ?? (see photo). 2. Bathroom was clean except for the tiles that could use some cleaning (see photo). There was no shower curtain and instead only a liner was placed. Toiletries were excellent. 3. There is no coffee maker in the room. 4. There is a big screen TV 5. There is a mini refrigerator 6. Only one elevator (of the two existing) worked resulting in long waiting periods 7. There is a business center in the lobby with two computers and free coffee/tea. Prints to the front desk 8. Cold water in the lobby 9. Staff is extremely nice and helpful 10. Location is excellent within two blocks from metro, numerous restaurants and grocery stores around it I travel extensively and I never stayed in a room that was called deluxe and was so inadequate. That room and the state it was on was in sharp contrast to the rest of the hotel, the lobby, the staff etc. I don't think this is new or recent as I have seen other people review about the very dirty windows. It should not take much to correct these things and it really ruins the impression of the hotel completely.

This hotel is in an older building which adds to the charm for me but you do have to realize that means not every room is the same. Be sure to ask about the different types and sizes of rooms before you book. The value is excellent when you can find a deluxe king room in the heart of the city for under $200 per night. We love the laid back less crowded vibe of the Upper West Side neighborhood. There are lots of restaurants and bars within walking distance and of course you are right between two excellent parks with Riverside Park 2 blocks one direction and beautiful Central Park just 3 blocks away the other direction and the subway is only 2 blocks away. Yes, it is true that the elevators are cramped, not the fastest, and often at least one is under repair. However, I can live with that in exchange for the charm, location, service, and incredibly comfortable beds. I sleep so much better there than at home!!

I can't say enough about how much we were pleased with this choice of hotel. We had a parlour suite on the 9th floor which overlooked the Hudson. Very spacious with hardwood floors. The bedroom had a very comfortable king. The sitting room had a fold-out sofa which was also comfortable. We squeezed in a rollaway in the bedroom. There were two 32 inch flatscreens and two window air conditioners which worked great. The mini fridge was a nice addition. We filled it with stuff from the Westside Market which is right beneath the hotel on Broadway. The bathroom was larger than we expected and had floor to ceiling tile. In short, this room exceeded our expectations on all levels. The staff was extremely prompt and courteous. The front desk had extra blankets and pillows sent up within 10 minutes of our requests. The bellmen were very helpful in procuring transportation and offering advice on ATMs, food, shopping, etc... Everyone there knew the neighborhood well. We had no trouble with slow elevators even though one of the 3 was out of order for four of the days we were there. The neighborhood the hotel in located in is very vibrant. Lots of shops and restaurants. We liked the Levain Bakery on 74th and Gina La Fornarina Restaurant which was on 73rd and Amsterdam. Ask to be seated downstairs if you don't like crowds. If you walk 3 blocks east you are at Central Park. My one regret is that I didn't ask the front desk where I could get a copy of the 1912 era photographic print of the Belleclaire and Broadway Ave. that was hanging in the bedroom.

This is A big problem -don't overlook this - cause hotel is crowded and you end up waiting in lines for an elevator!!!! 3) Front desk people seemed to be too busy to answer question or annoyed if you asked them ... Bad management to let this type of impoliteness to exist....people who stay at this hotel are not from NYC - how hard is this to figure out for staff !!! I asked a good restaurant and they couldn't tell me , I asked subway ticket question and I got \"it depends\" qualifying answer (meaning I could care less go figure it out yourself attitude).... I will not stay here again and unless they retrain their staff and fix the elevator I do not recommend anyone staying here--here is my summary: First time ever in NYC and the location of this hotel is best thing going for it. \u00a0As most negative reviews said - bummer only one small elevator works here - pretty ridiculous ...fits only bout 4 people at a time. \u00a0Rooms are nice and comfortable - no shared bathrooms - not sure why that rumor started - air-condition nice even from small window unit - it was 100 degrees outside yet cool inside room all the time. \u00a0 Subway is 2 blocks away - nicks diner right downstairs and great breakfast and lunch food - slice of pizza is the best - new York pizza is awesome! Museum of natural history is 4 blocks away and a good thing to do in day (air condition throughout). \u00a0 Subway is pretty tough to navigate with many many different lines/colors, plus there's construction so some lines not working???? Went to see ground zero, wall street, empire state bldg, all via subway - you should get $10 unlimited pass. \u00a0 Times Square by far the most impressive thing to experience in New York - like a gigantic party 24 hours a day - incredible energy and pandemonium in the air there!!!!", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Castle, Delaware", "Title": "\u201cDepends on the room\u201d", "Author": "gottakeepgoing", "ReviewID": "UR115779172", "Content": "Have stayed here twice now.

We lucked out and got street parking, free for 4 days, we had to alternate the car to the otherside of the street once during the trip but the doorman was helpful and gave us his spot. Our room was located in a wing with no one else staying in it. Our room had a double bed, sink, mirror, closet, chair, and large window. The bathroom (toliet & shower) were located in the hall. This was my first time using a shared bathroom at a hotel, other then a hostel. It was not as bad as I imagined it to be. The only weird part was you had to wash your hands once back in your room..so you had to touch all the door handles to get back to your room. Germ central. The room was very modern and nicely decorated though. Great food in the area...one of my favorite burger joints..Big Nicks is located just downstairs on broadway. They have the most signs you will ever see in a restaurant in your life. Its almost funny. If you can, sit on the patio, the inside is full of history but very crowded. They have super big portions and AMAZING AMAZING FOOD. The washroom in big nicks is scary. Be prepared. Its back where the dishwasher is. No matter, I frequent here when I am in the city. For around $12...and you can customize anything. From diet to meatless meat to glueten free they have it all.. Another two great things in the area..Zabars. Go here for Cheese, Fish, Bread...just walk around and take it all in. This is a city staple and everything in here is wonderful. H&H Bagels is also here...one of the oldest bagel shops in nyc. You can buy a bagel to eat, but the cream cheese is sold seperate and is not homeade..and they don't toast anything. The hotel is located on the Upper West Side. There are many great boutiques in the area, starbucks.. central park is a 10 minute walk..if you walk across to amsterdam there are lots of greats bars..shake shack is nearby..and its an overall great area...right on the subway line. While here, we went out in SoHo. If you are planning on going downtown..beware..its about a 30 minute subway ride...we took a cab back and it was around $20.

The bathroom was very clean even if basic, and fresh towels were provided for me even if I went out quite late in the morning. The worst thing ever was the view from the window: a brick wall. Next to it, another brick wall. If I really really stretched my neck, I could see a 10x10 cm of sky, very high above the building. It felt like a prison.

Standing in an elevator with five other people, along with our luggage, the elevator (the only one out of the two which was working) got stuck between the 6th and 7th floors. When we got off of the elevator, the staff was unhelpful. They gently informed us that this was the risk we ran by getting onto such an old elevator, and that this is not an unusual occurrence. From there on out, we rode the staff elevator which is in the midst of renovation (along with the rest of the hotel). Our understanding is that the hotel has been under renovation for a long time, and it doesn't seem to be ending soon. On a positive note, our room was beautiful. Although completely lacking in storage space, we appreciated the modern style and fixtures. We would definitely return to this hotel on the basis of the room, as well as on the basis of location. Besides for the unprofessional response to, and potentially dangerous condition of the elevator, the service on a whole was sub-par. The bellhop was unable to direct us on where to park, and was uninformed as to the parking regulations of the street on which the hotel is situated. The front desk directed us to a parking garage across the street which offers discounts to those staying in the hotel. Unfortunately, there were three garages across the street. When we contacted the front desk to inquire as to which parking garage was the correct one, we were strongly encouraged to use the valet parking instead. The front desk ignored our repeated requests regarding the parking garage. What it comes down to is that we loved the room. It was beautiful, comfortable and the location was ideal.

Last week we decided to make another trip to the Big Apple and chose the same hotel. During these 4 years that have passed since our previous visit, it has improved very much. Service is even better than before. Every morning they serve complimentary coffee and tea in the lobby. Even by European standards, the coffee is quite tasty and with a good strength. There is free complimentary wifi. However, this is one of the few things that are not perfect. The capacity of the network provided by Wanderport is very limited. In particular in the mornings it is more or less impossible to log on to the network due to too many subscribers on the network. Otherwise, it works fine. The hotel also has a business center where one can borrow a computer and printer for 5 dollars for 20 minute session and e g checkin on flights on the internet and print out boarding passes. There is no restaurant or breakfast served in the hotel, but across the street there is a quite good diner. For those who prefer to make their own breakfast in their rooms (since they are equipped with fridges) there is a food market just around the corner from the hotel. When we visited the hotel last week, one of the elevators were broken (out of total three elevators) so there was sometimes some waiting to get access to the elvators, but that is just minor temporary problems. All in all we can highly recommend this hotel. It has a great location, very close to the American Museum of Natural History, Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum and just a few subway stops from Times Square.

The location of this hotel was in the Upper West Side. There were many diners, supermarkets, pharmacies, retail stores and banks nearby. Some nearby supermarkets and food establishments were also open 24 hours. The hotel was a close walk to Central Park (Strawberry Fields) and the American Museum of Natural History. The nearest subway was two blocks away and taxis were available non-stop at every hour. As well, there were multiple well-known car rental depots right across the street, if you needed to rent a car. As for the hotel, I do have positive and negative comments to make. I stayed in room 605 (deluxe double) with a view of Broadway. First of all, I definitely recommend reserving a room with a view. The window was huge and you were able to open the window to enjoy fresh air and the nice view. On the other hand, the curtains were nonfunctional. Yes, it blocked the room from the sun in the morning, but it was hard to open and close the curtains. The room had an AC, but I never used it. The room also had a radiator, but I didn\u2019t need to change the setting or anything. However, another downside of the room was sporadically throughout the night, I heard either the radiator or pipe or ventilation noises. The noise came on and off, but for short periods of time. Room 605 also had: two double beds, a mini fridge, an in room safe (pay per use), a small closet, a flat screen TV, a floor length mirror, an iPod speaker/alarm clock, a small round table with two chairs, and a small washroom. The beds and pillows were very comfy and cozy. The mini fridge was great because I had a place to store leftovers or fresh snacks from the market close by. The channels on the TV provided plenty of options. The closet was small, but it stored two pieces of luggage, while a third one was placed outside of the closet. The iPod speaker/alarm clock was also great, but it wasn\u2019t a charging dock. The WIFI Internet was also good, but at times slow. In general, the room was clean and relaxing. As for the washroom, it was very small, with limited counter space, but it got the job done. It was clean and the shower\u2019s water pressure wasn\u2019t that bad. They also offered toiletries, which my travel companion said was acceptable. Lastly, the walls were thick enough for you to not hear your neighbors. As for their services, they had luggage storage if you checked in early, but check-in began at 3pm. I arrived at 8 am on March 3 and was told to come back around 1pm or they would call me when my room was ready. However, once I came back at 1, my room wasn\u2019t ready. So, I stayed in the lobby to rest. I checked in around 3pm, which was okay, but exhausting after traveling to NYC in an early morning flight. Regardless, the guy at reception was friendly and he did as best as he can to check when my room was ready. As well, one particular bellhop was really friendly and worked as best as he can to get tips. Too bad I didn\u2019t get his name, but he worked there in the early mornings or throughout the day. A last downside was the one small and slow elevator they had for guests. No more than four people were in there at a time. There was another elevator, but it was still being repaired. Overall, my interaction with the various employees at this hotel was delightful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in a more relax area than a typical touristy area in Manhattan.", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cHotel Belleclaire works for us.\u201d", "Author": "MiaRoller", "ReviewID": "UR100210956", "Content": "Just returned from 3 night stay.

I had lived on the Upper West Side some twenty plus years ago, so it felt like staying in a real New York neighborhood apartment, rather than a predictable tourist crash pad. The new decor is sort of hip urban-chic which transposes onto the vintage charm quite well. We had a king room on the corner, which was very spacious due to the round shape of the room. Unfortunately, that meant that the bathroom was quite small. This is an old Beaux Artes era building that has been updated quite effectively, but the architecture can be quaint or limiting, depending on your point of view. I found it charming. The ceilings are high and the windows large and overlooking Broadway. Again, the windows are a little drafty: charming or annoying? I didn't mind. In fact I liked not feeling hermetically sealed into a new building. The heat is very efficient from a cast iron radiator, which once you know how to control it, is great. It was off when we got into the room, but It warmed up quickly, once I turned it on. It can get hot, so no need to leave it on while we were out all day. The street noise can be LOUD all hours of the day and night. But I knew what to expect and my trusty earplugs insured me a great night's sleep in the very comfortable bed. I am a big fan of in-room coffee makers, so I was a little nervous about the absence of one in the room. But the 24 hr diner across the street delivers for free(tips, of course) and had piping hot, good coffee to the room in minutes after direct dialing it in. The afore mentioned Manhattan Diner is a very good value and the food is great. The location of The Belleclaire on Broadway and 77th made it a convenient spot to sightsee from. The proximity to the subway and crosstown bus on 79th was perfect, and safe even late at night. You can walk in any direction from the hotel and find any type of restaurant you could want. Great shopping and a real neighborhood vibe. The service at the hotel was OK, not that we needed anything beyond basic check in/out. Everyone was very nice. I really liked The Belleclaire.

I believe they would have changed our room again but I was exhausted and just wanted to go to sleep. It was also not clear to me what, beyond the size of the bed, made one room standard and another deluxe. The clientele appears to be international and well-mannered. All the rooms we were in were very quiet. Some floors still had revovations going on and we didn't stay there but there was no noise from that work in other parts of the hotel. The wi-fi wasn't working on our floor and the hotel made other arrangements so that I could do my email. I have always stayed on the eastside or in midtown on the west. This was the first opportunity to stay on the upper westside and I think we'll always go back.

Upper West Side seemed ideal... but: when we arrived, both elevators were out of use for repairs (why both at once?) so we had to use the service elevator, which was just dreadful, lined in hardboard. Great first impression! The room we were given, first floor, #114, smelt overpoweringly of solvent - apparently rubbing alcohol, used to clean the room. We couldn't open the lower part of the window, as it abutted the roof of the ground floor, and therefore was sealed for security reasons. We couldn't reach the upper part of the window, too high, the roller blind was jammed half shut, and the inner, venetian blind, was also jammed. The roof outside had on it a huge aircon unit, which was incredibly noisy, kept turning on and off all night, and there was litter all over the roof. The aircon unit in the window in our room had one knob missing, and a vent fell off onto the floor as soon as we turned it on to try to clear the smell. All the windows are single-glazed with aircon units in the lower halves, so rooms are dark and noisy. The staff were very helpful and apologetic, however, and the next day we were offered a change of room and a 20% rebate on our sleepless night. A full rebate would have been nicer... The room we got instead overlooked Broadway, on the 9th floor. We were offered a choice of a quieter alternative, but it faced a brick wall and the double bed was against the side wall, so only one side table and only oneside to get out of the bed - not great if you both need to get up in the night. So we opted for the Broadway view. Or, it would have been a view if the window hadn't been incredibly dirty. I tried to clean it with a tissue, just to be able to see out. No food at all in the hotel, but there was a GREAT diner across the street, Manhattan Diner, on corner of 77th and Broadway, open 24 hours a day. We ate there a lot. They do deliver to your room without charge, but there was no table or chairs to eat at, so a little difficult. There was a fridge in the room, but no kettle or coffee maker. A food supermarket was just round the corner, so we bought in stuff for breakfasts, including our own plastic cutlery and bowls.

My husband and I stayed here over the Christmas holiday and had a great stay. This place was clean and comfortable,. Room: The room we had was a corner room and was very spacious, especially considering that I have heard that other rooms are small. I have only two complaints about the rooms here: 1) the bathroom was tiny 2) the room was blazin' hot. The bathroom was about the size of a closet and could only accomodate one person at a time, but it was enough room to shower and brush my teeth. The room also stayed uncomfortably hot the entire time...and this was at the end of December. Maybe this was my fault since, for the life of me, I could not figure out how to turn the heat down or off. I tried several times at turning the dial, but it never went off. So, to fix this I'd just opened the windows to let a little cold air in. Hotel: The hotel was nice and it was especially nice for the price we booked. My only complaint about the place in general is that they have two, archaic elevators that are incredibly slow. A lot of times we would just take the stairs, but that wasn't so fun in layers of clothes. Staff: The staff was friendly and helped us out with places to visit. Area: I'm glad we chose to stay in this hotel. It was only two streets down from the subway and we never felt unsafe walking at night.

I'll come back to this one. The Belleclaire is the perfect combination of several elements: excellent value, clean and spacious room, comfortable bed, updated amenities, neighborhood. I won't say one can't find a hotel this good for $200 or so a night, but you'd have to look quite hard to find one. Our room was freshly appointed, with flat screen TV, free internet, polished wood floors, nice comfy queen bed, very quiet. The window was a bit small, the view so so good. Well, so what. Yes, the elevator is small and slow, there's no restaurant/coffee shop or newstand (but free NY Post in the lobby). I didn't miss them. I loved the upper West Side neighborhood. Walking distance to Central Park, Lincoln Center, Riverside Park, Columbus Circle. Subway at 79th(local) and 72nd(express). Non touristy, plenty of restaurants, from neighborhood bars to the very excellent Ouest 3 blocks away. Movie theaters a few blocks in either direction, wonderful residential architecture on the side streets, a feeling of living with the locals. The staff was fine...not overly friendly but quite acceptable, many foreigners among the guests. It would have been even better if breakfast was included, but not to be. Room service is available and provided by the Manhatten Diner across the street. One might want to try it out before relying on it, as it looks like a typical New York coffee shop restaurant. I read in Zagat's that Nick's on B'way just around the corner from the lobby entrance is highly thought off and open 24 hours; also just down the street is Zabar's, specialty groceries and coffee shop. One could complain, I suppose, that it's a bit out of the way from Museums, shopping, art galleries, B'way theaters. Didn't bother me.

Here's an honest review, based on what I've read from past comments. First of all, the location, at least to me, was perfect. Two blocks from Central Park and two blocks from the subway. The best part was the neighborhood - quiet and clean. I've stayed at nice Times Square hotels before, but this is a gem regarding peaceful nights and the area is just a nice contrast from the dirty and sometimes sketchy New York streets. Yes, the fact that the entrance is hard to find is true - but once you are in, the lobby is very nice. Small, but it is a boutique hotel, not a major chain. The staff was professional. Perhaps not overly friendly, but nice enough, and we weren't really expecting hugs - they were well informed and service was fast. The elevator indeed is tiny, but I don't understand the complains - it just takes you up and down, you don't sleep in the elevator. The hallways were very clean, I noticed there always were staff members around. We stayed in the queen bed room with a private bathroom. The rooms are more spacious than I thought - they had nice hardwood floors and they were very clean. I personally liked the decoration, the whole set up reminded me of European hotels in terms of size and layout - it really had character and the bed was very comfortable. No complains regarding the washroom, and I never saw a single bug. The A/C is indeed a bit noisy, but not to the point where it was unbearable, and I understand that it must be the only way to keep prices affordable in this older building, so it really didn't bother me at all. If you expect The Waldorf at Comfort Inn prices, maybe this isn't for you. New York hotels can be extremely pricey, and I've found the affordable ones to be \"iffy\" at best and avoidable at worst, so I thought I really paid the right price at this hotel and would definitely recommend it and would be back.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cI'll be back.\u201d", "Author": "Aneetah", "ReviewID": "UR67993420", "Content": "I've been to quite a few hotels in NYC and this is the only one I'll stay at more than once for sure.

But if you mostly get around by taxi, you might as well spend those extra dollars and stay further down on manhattan. The A/C was so noisy, we had to turn it off to be able to sleep at all.

This time with 20 yr old son. Reviewing room 629 at the Hotel Belleclaire that is has 2 twins and a shared bath down the hallway. I asked for a very private and quiet part of the hotel since the previous trip to NYC was quite noisy and I didn't sleep well. Let me tell you it was dead silent!! The bathroom was only shared with 2 other rooms and we never had to wait on anyone and it was spotless. Our room was nice sized, had a refrigerator, flat screen tv, ac... extremely quiet!! There is a market right around the corner so you can pick up groceries for your refrigerator. Also right next to the market is a nice neighborhood restaurant called Big Nick's. Sometimes we ate there and sometimes we'd pull up their menu on our laptop and order a meal and my 20 year old son would go pick it up and bring it back to our room. They also have delivery if you don't want to pick it up. There are also several nice neighborhood restaurant there. What I also like about the Belleclaire is that it's in a more traditional Manhattan neighborhood, so you see people that live there or possible students from Columbia University on bikes, etc. vs. the last time we stayed on Times Squares and all that noise! Also, you are 2 very, very short blocks away from the 1 subway train which takes you north or south. (It's the Red colored train on the map) there are exchanges at 50th and there are tons of exchanges at 42nd St (this one is Times Square). Believe me...my son was a little overwhelmed the first day with the subway system but then the second day on he was completely fine getting around. That's why I chose Belleclaire as a test to see if he could handle the transfers of the subway system all on his own if he chooses to go to Columbia University or work on Wall St. and he figured it all out without me saying a word in 1 day...it's that simple. From Belleclaire which is on 77th St. you walk North to 79th st on the West side of the Road. You want to go to Times Square? Then you want to go South. You'll always go below the side of the street in the direction the car would be going if you would be driving. Next transfer your debit card in the machine and transfer to the subway card, again very simple....get on the 1 train...get off at 42nd street (like 4 exits down) walk up the steps and you're in time square. This is like 10 minutes. Going back from Times Square to Hotel Belleclaire be on the East side of the road (going North) just like you would be in a car take the steps down. You can use the Hotel's computer /printer to print out your boarding passes for 5 bucks the day before you leave which was nice, too. And the taxi ride back to LGA was around $35.00 which I thought was a decent price. Oh, and the Hotel is very close to Central Park like a 10 minute walk to the central part of central park but I don't advise entering the park without a map if you don't have a map with you since you may get lost with all the trails.

We had an economy room which required us to share a bathroom with two others rooms. I'd never done that before and never will again. If you've never done it before, imagine delaying the start of your day - up to an hour or two - because you have to wait for people to shower before you. Imagine having to simply use the toilet quick but not being able to because someone is showering. That was bad enough, but the bathroom was down right gross. It reminded me of a camp ground bathroom. It was old, dingy & really dark (how difficult is it to replace the one dull light fixture??). There was no fan to help with the humidity after a shower, which I'm guessing is why there was black mold everywhere on the tile's grout. The drain didn't drain fast enough, so you ended up wading in a bath of water (gross when there could be hair in it from the previous person)! We couldn't seem to shut off the radiator/heater in our room, so even when leaving the window wide open (no screen) didn't help enough, we had to leave our window unit a/c on. It was less than 50 degrees out at the time. The window unit a/c caused problems itself, because the exposure to the outdoors (gaps around it that weren't sealed) made it sound like you were sleeping in a tent! The unit looked like something heavy had dropped on it from the outside, because it had a huge dent in it. We were just so suprised at the low standards & what they considered acceptable - something you'd expect from a college dorm room & not a hotel! The photos are misleading. You would assume the hotel occupies the entire building, and you walk into the front of it into a proper sized lobby. Nope - you enter on the side of the building (an entrance that you could easily miss), and the lobby is small & narrow. The two side by side elevators should be made into one normal size one. I'm not kidding when I say you cannot fit more than three people in it, and even that is cramped. I've never seen such a small elevator! The hallways where the rooms are are so narrow that in some parts we couldn't wheel a piece of luggage down it. We had to turn it on its side and pick it up. The place feels like a doll house.

Before booking I called to make sure that it was going to be good for a handicapped person. I was travelling with my mother who had a knee replacement in October and is still healing. I made it very clear on the phone that we could not share a bed and there would need to be a bit of room to maneuver in the room. I was assured that even if I booked via Hotwire it would be fine, as the person on the phone took down my name (unfortunately I did not catch theirs). We get to our room, very excited as it would be my mum's first time staying over in NYC and we're in this gorgeous hotel that I've shown her the website/photos for. We open our door to find one twin/full bed, a desk, and a TV. There wasn't even enough room for 2 people to SIT on that bed, let alone sleep. The bathroom was small but very nice, and there was a large closet...space that could have been better utilized in my opinion. On top of this, the room stunk of what I thought was men's cologne - however it's one of the products the cleaning staff uses. I could tell instantly that my mother was extremely disappointed, as I had ASSURED her that everything would be fine and now it wasn't. We ended up completing all of our plans in NYC except for staying over and eating a traditional breakfast the next morning (which we were both quite excited for, I used to live in the city and sometimes miss it quite a bit). On the survey you get upon checkin, I explained to them exactly why we left early and why I was disappointed. I left my phone number and email address and honestly expected to at least hear from customer service. Not a peep. I'm actually going to be forwarding them this review as well, because that is *NOT* how you handle a situation.

We, and our friends both found the hotel rooms comfortable with full baths and a closet. Location was very good. The upper west side is a kid-friendly, easy access, quieter neighborhood, and riverside park is just two blocks away. The room had a small refrig, AC, heat, comfortable bed, clean bath, and we slept well . We really liked the hotel but the desk staff detracted from our stay. The cleaning service was very good and the rooms kept clean (i could walk barefoot on the floors without dirt). The doormen helped with questions, opening the door for guests and very friendly to everyone. It bothers me to make the following distinction but the friendly factor varied widely between the men and the women who staffed the hotel. As a working woman who tries to keep male female distinctions out of the work place, this was such an exceptional difference I feel I have to mention it. Our friends and us found the male staff at the door and at the desk very friendly and helpful. The women behind the counter were much less knowledgable or did not want to offer service, and at times gave the classic NY negative attitude. Two examples, a basic question about restaurants for breakfast and a repetivie problem with our room keys. On morning #4 we wanted to eat at a different location but was once again referred to Manhattan cafe for breakfast or to the European Bakery which we had been to on more than one occassion. I said that we had tried those already and inquired nicely if was there a third option, she looked at me and walked away to help another customer! With a classic NY attitude, because I pressed a second time, I recieved one other reference but it took a 5 min conversation to get the information, and required me to not be willing to go away easily. My husband was very frustrated when every day we had to get new room keys made. He was suprised when he was consistently chastised/ blamed by the women behind the desk because he was not taking proper care of the keys! The first day he was told that the metro card was demagentizing the room key. Sorry not possible! Day 2 he was told it was due to cell phones but we left our cell phones at home 3000 miles away so to be undistirbed by work phone calls! After a third example on Day 3 he complained later to another desk clerk (male) was told the real story. The desk clerk explained that those making the keys for us were not following the process correctly so they would only work until the next morning. Had the women only fixed the key and not blamed the traveler with such gusto we likely would not have found the experience so unpleasant.

After catching an earlier flight than expected, I arrived at the hotel at 10am and was pleased to find that my room was ready and I was given the key straight away. As you would expect for a budget room, facilities were basic but more than adequate. Flat-screen TV, desk, radio alarm clock with iPod dock, refrigerator, closet, and a night stand on either side of the (very comfortable) double bed. When I checked in, I was told that nobody else would be using the shared bathroom so I had it all to myself - it seems the other rooms along my part of the corridor had all been refurbished with their own facilities. I can confirm a couple of things from other reviews - yes there are some very noisy pipes in the hotel, and even though I enquired about changing rooms I was told that it wouldn't really make a lot of difference due to the age of the building. Also, one of their elevators is still out of order and the the one that works really is very slow! Noise was a bit of an issue for me in other areas - street noise all through the night (not helped by the laundry van which spent about half an hour outside every single night at around midnight), and the noise situation inside the hotel could have been better. The doors to the rooms are very heavy and will slam easily (and loudly!), and hanging the \"please do not disturb\" sign on the door seemed to be read as \"dear housekeeping, please vacuum this corridor as soon as possible\" which caused a bit of annoyance. It's true that these issues can be overcome eaily enough with the help of a decent set of earplugs, but it would be preferable for these issues to not exist in the first place. At least the ones inside the hotel - I understand there's not much anybody can do about street noise! Despite this, the hotel's location is excellent - just a minute's walk to 79th St subway station, and plenty of convenience stores and restaurants nearby.

I stayed in this hotel with my boyfriend about two years ago. We wanted to take a NYC trip in the off season, and got some awesome rates on everything. Including this hotel, which was running a discount where staying 3+ nights would get you the 3rd free. We stayed in a double room with shared bath. It came out to about 50$ a night so it would have taken a lot to make us unhappy with the hotel. My dad who grew up in Queens recognized the name of this place and remembered it as being nice. Location: really good. Nice neighborhood. Just down the street from a subway station, across the street from an awesome diner, and there were little groceries (and a duane reade) along the street between the subway and the hotel. I mention the groceries/convenience store because we were lucky enough to get really bad colds during our stay and we were able to get the loads of cold medicine we needed without going out of our way. Room: we had a double with shared bath. We had no trouble using the bathroom/shower. I think I heard other people so I'm pretty sure one of the other sharing rooms was occupied, but we didn't see 'em. The room was adequately sized, but it's just a place to sleep and relax after running around all day. It was larger than the bed, which is more than I can say for more expensive rooms in other large cities. Radiator heat which made the room plenty warm when we turned it up. Enough that we needed to open the window and cool it down during the night. Staff: didn't see much of them, but they seemed friendly and they did their jobs. I recall the maid coming to our room multiple times while we slept in/got ready in the morning - she really wanted to tidy our room I guess. That was a pain, as we sort of wanted privacy to get dressed and all and she kept opening the door. Otherwise, we had no trouble. The front desk people helped us with directions and advice. They held our bags for free when we arrived before check-in. The lobby is really nice, too. Looking now I see the rates have gone up a lot and the deals for this January aren't nearly as good, so we might not be staying there in this years planned trip during the same time, but I don't know if I want to take the chance of getting a crappy hotel for not much less.", "Date": "December 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cAMAZING\u201d", "Author": "sjh9Edmonton", "ReviewID": "UR50814924", "Content": "My boyfriend and I both loved this hotel.

Staff were friendly as well and the neighbourhood was appropriate for travelling with our 3 year old \u2013 more residential and less hectic than the mid-town area. We recommend the Bellclaire, but please stay away from room 912. On check-in we were given this room, which at first seemed fine until the night when there was this horrible hissing and clanking noise coming from this peculiar vent (pipe) in the bathroom. There was noise also from the street however that did not bother me since this is New York City after all. My husband went down to the front desk to enquire about a room change and was told that because the Bellclaire is an older hotel, all of the rooms had this problem and they could not guarantee that if we changed rooms the noise would be any better. I decided it was worth the risk to stay in another room and we moved to room 511 the next day where I immediate check the bathroom to see if it had another one of those peculiar pipes. No pipe \u2013 no noise, and I had two very comfortable nights of sleep. So, stay at the Bellclaire if you are looking for a reasonable place in the upper west side, but avoid room 912 at all cost! Other tips \u2013 the hotel is also close to the subway (the 1 Train (local) on 79 street and the 1,2,&3 trains (express) on 72 street. There were also good choices for eating.

Filene's basement just a few blocks north for great discount shopping. A CVS drugstore not far away ... we even saw a movie ... the theater was also just a few blocks north. Subway stop very close by. The hotel staff were accomodating. Talk to Sare, the young door/bellman. I think he's a real up and comer in the hospitality field. Very helpful, always smiling ... remembers things ... a good kid. The room was small but adequate, pretty much as advertised. Sharing a washroom was not as bad as I thought it would be ... it's New York after all and no one lounges around the hotel much. One quibble ... I would have expected the shower curtain to be have been magnetized so it didn't ride in on you when you were taking a shower. And just one more thing: there's a small but funky gift shop in the lobby ... it even had three internet stations. This was important, because my wife's laptop wouldn't work in New York due to a company firewall. I must have spent an average of $15 dollars a day on the gift shop internet but I didn't mind due to the convenience. I thought that area of Manhattan would be crawling with Internet Cafes but it wasn't, most locals just go wireless wherever they are. The trouble is, I understand the gift shop will be shutting down in March when the lease is up and the hotel will use the space for something else.

Great Location-with a block of 2 different subway stops & straight up Broadway if you were to take a taxi.

Small Bathrooms-no necessarily a con, but unless you've traveled to Europe & experienced there bathrooms, then these bathrooms will be small to you.

The hotel was under construction with one working elevator and a service elevator for use. Luckily we were on the 2nd floor so could use the stairs. I may have found this more inconvenient if we were higher up. The room itself is no frills but i wasn't there to hang out in my room. There were 2 good quality beds, a couple of chairs and a desk under each of 2 flat screen TV's. The maids forgot us one day and we had a backed up toilet another day.

Again he was quick and effecient, even bringing a space heater. Street noise was a nuisance because i am not accoustomed to noise and sirens all night long--but again NYC city that never sleeps--obviously not the hotels fault.

Definately get a metro card if you want to save some bucks. There are 2 reasonable markets close by and we had a small fridge--so milk, snacks and such in the room were no problem. It also felt like a really safe neighborhood, (although we did see a girl get arrested at the restaurant around the corner, for trying to skip out on a bill).

The bad: the place is in the middle of construction and the elevators aren't working PLUS the elevator that is working is TINY, room keys stop working randomly and you have to go back down to the front and get re-keyed, next to a major intersection and the windows are thin so you get sirens, car alarms, etc. throughout the night, and there are people who live in the hotel that are kind of sketchy. Here is where the fine print comes in: I got an economy room and didn't look closely enough to see that it was a shared bathroom and shower between 3 rooms.

The location is fantastic and near many local attractions, but wear comfy shoes if you plan to walk.

Chamber maids perhaps not brilliant; one day we weren't left any toiletries (I was relying on the shampoo and conditioner!), and another day we asked for an extra pillow and received even more towels, but no pillow. The next day the extra towels were taken away and not replaced (so not good if we really HAD wanted more towels), but still no extra pillow. Hotel: 3 pillows between 2 people are not enough. One of the lifts was broken; not a massive problem, but annoying. There was a full length mirror in our room but hung at about 5 foot from the floor, so we could only see ourselves up to our chests.

Rooms are spotless and are very large for a NYC hotel. We stayed in a two queen deluxe and it fitted to adults just fine. The flat screen TV is more like a PC monitor but nevertheless creates a nice modern touch in a very typical 60s NYC room. Wood floors and large windows add tones of character. I stayed at a room overlooking Broadway and the Fire Station. When combined, the two will be well enough to keep you up all night. If you are a light sleeper but still want to feel the wibe of the city when you are awake, get some earplugs. Otherwise, ask for a room facing the back of the building. Lobby area and the hallways of the hotel might be misleading as a first impression but this changes as you walk in and out. It feels as if you are going to your apartment rather than a hotel room. I liked that. Location is great. Right on Broadway and about a very enjoyable 15min walk to Central Park, with lots of places to eat on the way. Very close to the subway and plenty of busses stop right in front of the hotel. The dinner across the street is very good and convenient. They even deliver to your room, as the hotel does not have a restaurant. There are plenty of places other places to eat around. You can also find a few grocery stores, liqueur store and book store all within 10mins walking distance towards the Beacon Theatre. I think this is a very nice hotel with plenty of personality.

The Belleclaire was absolutely perfect for us because it was such good value for money. We had a family room for 4 (two interconnecting bedrooms plus ensuite bathroom). The room was on the small side but perfectly adequate. Both of the bedroom windows looked out on the quadrangle in the centre of the building. This made it a little dark, but again, not a problem. The room and bathroom were spotless. Some thought had gone into the decor and interesting modern furnishings. The only negative thing I can say about the room is that I found the A/C quite noisy. I was awake a lot of our first night. However, in all fairness, we were straight off the plane from London and rather jetlagged. So this is more likely to account for the bad night\u2019s sleep. I also liked the location. It is perfect for families. We felt safe walking around the neighbourhood with our children after dark. The Manhattan Diner across the road is an authentic NY diner.

We booked a superior king room and when we entered the room were shocked to find that it looked hardly anything like the photo on their website. The room was very small and the king bed took up most of it. There was a tiny window in the back corner of the room letting in a small amount of light and the toilet was also running. I called reception to complain and they offered to move me to a queen size room which they said would be larger. I was astounded that the king room that I was paying extra for was actually smaller in size than the queen room! The queen room was still sub-standard and only had a small window, again in the far corner of the room. The window was propped open with a shampoo bottle and the air conditoner was wrapped in a towel! When I asked reception why I didn't get a king room that looked like it did on their website they said that there is only 4 rooms in the entire hotel that look like the king room on their website and that every room in the hotel is a different size! They also didn't send anyone to the room to move our luggage so we had to move it all to the other room ourselves. The TV reception was so poor that it was frustrating to even watch TV. We had spent almost 3 weeks in Manhattan staying in apartments and found that the Belleclaire was the only place where the reception was bad. The remote control also worked only sometimes. I would not recommend this hotel but instead would suggest to stay in an apartment. My husband and I stayed in a wonderful apartment on W 75th Street, close to the Belleclarie for almost a week. We had a separate kitchen, large bathroom and big bay windows overlooking the street, and we payed $250 a night, much less than the Belleclaire!", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cIt was ok\u201d", "Author": "Minibreakergirl", "ReviewID": "UR21975167", "Content": "My stay at the hotel with my sister for a week was rather tainted by the crazy man who appeared to live in the room at the end of our corridor!

The location is fantastic but the hotel was very disappointing the second time around - so much so that I can guarantee I'll not be back. Upper West Side is a brilliant location but the Belleclaire, for us, was not. The temperature is something that seems to be a common problem with the hotel and it seems to be pot luck as to whether you get a good room or not.

Everything was clean and in good condition, with crisp linen. The staff were very helpful, the concierge excellent (found us a good restaurant for a reasonable price near the Phantom). As for location, the hotel is a fair bit uptown, but close to both 79th (Line1) and 72nd St. Metro stops (1/2/3) and it was never an issue to get around. There's a great diner with good food across the crossroads, a cheerful bakery a few doors up, and two pubs within staggering distance, if downtown is too far away for your taste.

The hallways were narrow and stuffy and our room was fairly small with a brick wall view. We chose to get a room with a shared bathroom. This was ok as we never needed to use it when it was occupied, however it was a little dirty with standing water and soap scum. The room itself was very basic and again much different than the pictures we saw online. That said, we were in New York and didn't want to spend much time at the hotel anyways. If you're looking for an affordable hotel with no frills but a decent place to lay your head down, this one may work for you.

The beds were as comfortable as most hotel beds, we had what we needed and while not a great view, I enjoyed looking down at the people and traffic.

The Pros: Good sized room - especially for NY Comfortable bed (although the double was small) Clean linens - sheets with a minimum of stains, towels fluffy Nice size desk area - although I didn't use it, I always book a king bed so I can spread out on it - obviously not possible on a double bed Relatively clean room, although I found some hair and dust on the floor when I dropped a pantyliner sticky-side down - yuck. Shower pressure was good The Cons: Gray grout in bathroom makes the whole thing look dirty Only one trashcan in the whole room - in the bathroom Remote control wasn't strong enough to reach the TV in the double room (although this was better in the king room) Weird bathroom layout (in the double room, I had to close the door to use the sink) Ugly light fixture in the center of the room. Really ugly - they could have spent 5 dollars more and made it better Inadequate lighting - I had to rearrange the lamps to get enough light to even read Toiletries in the bathroom were obviously not fresh - yuck. Lousy TV selection - no TBS, Food Network, Discovery channel, TLC...? No washcloths - is this a European thing? This has happened to me several times lately... Hallways look like what you'd find in a hostel My opinion of the hotel might be different if they had offered anything for my inconvenience of switching rooms... but all they did was switch me. I think they should have refunded my first room night, or at the very least offered me a discount on a future stay. But nothing. I never heard from them again, not even to check in and see how the new room was working out. Sigh.

I feel very fortunate that my first experience there was at the Belleclaire. This property is in a charming part of the city - I absolutely fell in love with the tree-lined avenues, the neighborhood merchants, and the grace and vibrance all around. There is a marvelous and extremely cost effective diner across the street, and an excellent grocer just around the corner on Broadway. There are wonderful bakeries nearby. Central Park is a couple of blocks to the east, the Hudson River a couple of blocks to the west. The hotel had a stellar staff. Check in was quick and pleasant. When I came practically stumbling out of the elevator with a heavy bag, a bellboy almost ran to the elevator to help me with the awkward luggage. Another bellboy engaged us in conversation while we were waiting in the lobby. Over 4 days I did not encounter anyone at the Belleclaire that was anything less than courteous and professional. For a major city, the room was large (2 queen beds) and clean. The bath and beauty products supplied by the hotel were more than sufficient and of good quality. The towels were soft and thick, and smelled wonderful. Our room had hardwood floors, and added to the feeling of cleanliness of the room. The only downside was that the air conditioner had a hard time keeping up with the intense July heat. I would guess this is not uncommon in hot, humid locales. I brought a small fan and am so glad I did. One other minor detail is that the hallways are not terribly glamorous. They're old looking - I guess reflecting the true background of the building. They also are not air conditioned, and I am a big fan of air conditioning during hot, humid summers. Conversely, if they cooled and spritzed up the the hallways, the Belleclaire would probably not be able to offer the amazing price that we got (air and hotel package deal thru Travelocity).

Having never been to New York City before, nor really knowing the neighborhoods, I was understandably nervous about finding a nice place to stay. We were SO pleased with the Hotel Bellclaire. Parking: We arrived on a Sunday (having driven from Wisconsin) & the frontdoorsman was kind enough to help us find a chance spot to park on thet street. When it was time to move the car two days later, we selected the Hertz Rental Car garage on 77th street. They have a deal w/ the hotel & parking was only $25 a day- considering this is NYC, that is pretty reasonable. I was very nervous about having a car in the city since everyone says \"don't drive in Manhattan.\" All in all our experience was a good one. We left the car in the parking garage for the week & took the subway or walked. This Hertz lot is just up the street from the hotel so it was easy to walk, luggage in hand, to pick up our car the day we left town. The hotel: Lobby is small & nice. The staff typically greeted us with a \"hello\" each time we passed through. We were able to check in a bit early which was nice. At first the front desk staff couldn't find our Expedia reservation but after we presented our paperwork & the clerk checked a bit, all was well. The elevators (2) in the hotel are small but that's typical for an older building. As someone who is usually nervous about elevators, these worked just fine. We were on the 7th floor. I rarely saw anyone in the halls & thought the hotel itself was rather quite. Space in the city is at a premium & we thought that they made good use of space in our room (a queen sized bed, single bathroom). The decor is contemporary, flat screen tv, etc. We basically only spent enough time in our room to sleep each night. It was 80-90 degrees the entire week & we were so happy that the window a/c worked well. Neighborhood: This is a fantastic neighborhood. We always felt safe, even walking in the evening. Lots of grocery stores, restaurants, etc. Near the subway (5 min. walk at most) & 10 min. walk to Central Park. Overall: Personally I find these reviews to be rather nervewracking since people can have a random bad experience & then trash an otherwise nice hotel. I would say that this is a really great place to stay. We saw everyone from European families, to couples, younger groups, etc. I would highly recommend this hotel & hope that others have as positive an experience as we did.", "Date": "July 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angleles, CA", "Title": "\u201cIncredible value!!\u201d", "Author": "CocoFoSho", "ReviewID": "UR18115279", "Content": "I stayed at the Bellclaire for the second time in april this year, I have to say I was not disappointed!

The hotel itself doesnt have a restaurant but there is a great diner right across the street called the Manhattan Diner that is very decently priced with delicious food that offers room service to the bellclaire! you have a number and menu right in your room, you just call them up and before you know it they are at the door of your room with your meal! I really couldnt ask for more at such a great price. Most dont see the appeal in booking the economy room which is a small room that has a shared bathroom (you only share it with two other rooms). Let me tell you, I have booked the economy room twice and there has never been ONE time where i needed to use the restroom or take a shower and couldnt because it was occupied. I pretty much felt like it was my own private bathroom, and though the other two rooms i shared the bathroom with were booked, i never ran into the people from those rooms or heard any noise, etc. The room is small, but EVERYTHING in New York is small, and if you ask me, its actually a GOOD size for a room in ny, ive seen new york apartments that small. In addition to that, if youre going to new york for vacation, you should only be in your room to sleep, change clothes , and shower. you dont need a room any bigger than that because you should be out enjoying everything new york has to offer, HOWEVER, should you happen to require more space, the upgraded rooms are considerably larger from what i saw walking by and from pictures they are a little more lavish. The workers there are very helpful and the housekeeper is also very friendly and helpful and very attentive to the rooms. All in all, I cant imagine getting a better deal anywhere else.

Nine members of our extended family also stayed at the Belleclaire for five days, and they were also very pleased with their rooms and the hotel in general. The only complaint I have is that we bought ticket vouchers from the conceirge for a Circle Line cruise. They were $6 and he informed us that it would guarantee our seats on the cruise. We just needed to get off the subway and it was a short walk to the pier. The walk turned out to be a lot farther than we had anticipated. We arrived at the pier, only to be told that the cruise was sold out. Neither the concierge, nor Circle Line would refund the vouchers. It was very frustrating. But that was the only problem we ran into. We would recommend Big Nick's Pizza, which is just around the corner, and has the biggest slices of pizza we'd ever seen.

When I checked in, the agent started to give me a room on a high floor, but the manager stopped her and insisted that I be put on the second floor. My \"deluxe\" room was an odd-shaped room, and while not tiny, was pitifully underfurnished. There was no dresser, nor drawers, nor shelves in the closet to put away clothes. That meant liviing out of the suitcase. There was no coffee maker, no ice bucket, no glasses -- only a few cheap paper cups. The hairdryer did not get hot -- only blew lukewarm air -- so it took forever to dry my hair. There was an air conditioner in the window that blocked the light and was constantly on, making a constant hum. The second night of my stay, it was in the 30's outside, but the hotel had no heat. When I complained, they brought me a space heater that blew out the fuse. I really cannot see how this hotel gets three stars, nor how it charges the prices it does.", "Date": "April 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UKtraveller56", "Title": "\u201cGreat NYC hotel but so noisy at night\u201d", "Author": "UKtraveller56", "ReviewID": "UR15182116", "Content": "We'd agree with much of what's already been said about this hotel.

It is just a few blocks walk to the American Musuem of Natural History, Central Park and the Dakota/Strawberry Field garden. Parking was easy and inexpensive - for NYC, that is (you get a discount with a nearby garage - our van cost $25/day and I think a car would have been $15/day with this discount). It was really nice at the end of a long day of sightseeing to return to a hotel in a slightly less congested part of Manhattan - more residential. They also have an I Love NYC gift shop connected to the lobby.

The two other rooms in our group were double beds, but the size difference of their two rooms varied significantly.

The hotel is in a residential area, which I liked. The staff was friendly and helpful - only two problems-the desk told us how to get to Yankee stadium, then another worker @ the hotel stopped us to tell us another way because he lives in Brooklyn. He told us to take a particular subway that we later found out wasn\u2019t running on weekends! We wasted 30 minutes waiting on that train! I'm sure it was an honest mistake. Also, when we were leaving the hotel a black taxi was out front. He offered to give us a ride to the airport and the lady that works in the gift shop told me it would be safe and that she knew the guy. Well, he didn't understand which airport and when I noticed him going the wrong way I tried to clarify and he just said he's going a diff way. After arriving in New Jersey I told him again that we needed LGA so he stopped, turned around, got lost, upset other drivers (got yelled at lots along the way back to Manhattan) and we almost missed our flight.

On checking in, the extremely helpful staff noted that we had opted to upgrade and then offered us a King room at no extra charge! We ended up with one of the round king rooms situated towards the front on the hotel. The room overlooked Broadway and the receptionist advised us to let her know if the noise from the road bothered us and she would move us. (We stayed in room 206) The room was fab! MASSIVE bed and flatscreen TV, Ipod docking station etc! You can hear the traffic but its not a very busy road at night, the odd truck or fire truck but nothing that caused any disturbed sleep!

Without wanting to repeat previous reviews, we got a great deal via expedia booking the flight and hotel together- at least half the price of advertised room rates, if not less. There are lots of positives to this hotel. Our room (908) was quite spacious, comfortable, very clean, no cockroaches, it had everything we needed and our towels etc. were changed every day. The bed was a little smaller than we expected, but this was remedied by getting a \"rollaway\" bed (ask reception) for $10 per night which was a single camp-bed on wheels. We took it in turns to sleep on it (its not as comfortable as a real bed) and it did the job. It will depend on which room you have as to whether you can fit in the rollaway bed - our room was plenty big enough. We shared a bathrom with 2 other rooms, as we were on a strict budget and this got us the best price. The bathroom is the only thing which wasn't satisfactory. The tiles were pretty horrid and old, but it was clean overall and we didn't have any problems with it being occupied when we needed it. My partner didn't like it at all and I had to force her to take a shower! The shower was hit and miss, and was difficult to get the temperature and flow to stay constant. One day it actually stopped whilst I was under it and I had to dip my head in the sink to rinse off my conditioner! I have to mention that if you are in rooms 908, 909 or 910, the shared bathroom window is right next to a large ventilation chute which serves one of the eatieries below. It pumped out awful smelling greasy cooking smoke and fumes most of the time, which was pretty nasty, so the bathroom window was kept closed, for fear that we would exit the bathroom more smelly than we had enterered it! I would assume that the bathrooms on the floors above and below would also be affected. Basically, if you insist on having a great bathroom, the Belleclaire is not for you. If your room is Broadway side, you should definitely bring earplugs, as the road is noisy 24/7, even with the window closed. As our room was hot, we needed the window open. Our radiator made strange noises (we likened it to Chinese water torture!) which woke us up most nights, even with earplugs in, but that was not a big deal for us. The neighbourhood is fantastic and the hotel is located perfectly for getting around on the subway - the number 1 line is very convenient. We loved Manhattan Diner and ate there every day, mainly for breakfast. Their burgers and salmon nicoise salad are excellent too. Highly recommended. Ruby Foos across the road is very nice, but more pricey (if you are from the UK, don't order their peking duck, because it isn't half as nice as what you will be used to). We tried lots of eateries in the area and all except one were lovely. The worst was Nico's which is on the corner a little way up from the hotel - the moussaka was awful! For an amazing steak (pricey though) we recommend Michael Jordan's restaurant in Grand Central Terminal (on the 1st floor). It is fab to watch all the commuters bustling about below - a great experience. We also went to Gallagher's steakhouse (West 52nd and Broadway) which was recommended by reception and that was pricey too, but not as nice as Jordan's at Grand Central. All in all, for a budget hotel, the Belleclaire was a super find.

I was told that the rooms with the shared bath were going to be the last to be remodeled. The room that we were placed in consisted of a regular television, a queen bed, old carpet, a refrigerator, a sink and a heater (like the ones you see in \u2018I Love Lucy\u2019) that made A LOT of noise. The bathroom itself wasn\u2019t any better, it had green tiles that were past its time. At this point, I had to go down to the lobby and upgrade my room because there was no way I was going to be miserable for the next 7 days in New York. When I asked for an upgrade, they told me there was an extra charge of $50 dollars per night and without any hesitation, I agreed. The upgraded room was a lot nicer. It looked like the one in the pictures on their website. There was a plasma television, hardwood flooring, a refrigerator, I pod docking station and a private bath. Unfortunately, the heater made a lot of noise and the bathroom that was in my room wasn\u2019t remodeled. It had the same miserable tiles that I saw in the shared baths . . . which was a big disappointment. Finally, my last complaint, which is a legitimate complaint in my opinion. The room that I was in had cockroaches. I killed 3 in the bathroom and 1 got away out in the bedroom. I am disclosing this because when you go buy food, make sure you don\u2019t leave it out. Don\u2019t throw the wrapper in the trash can in the bathroom, take it the lobby or throw it in the trash cans in front of the hotel. I can handle a lot of gross things in life but to see the cockroaches in my room was the last straw. With all the money I spent on the hotel, I felt that I could have gotten a nicer one.

I would recomend anyone staying at this hotel to get a room above the 4th floor due to the renervation work being done, also for a 200 room hotel to have only two very small lifts was a problem. Now for the good, New York was wonderful, the hotel location is fanastic, anything that you would want is right on the doorstep. The location really did save this stay. However I would stongly recomend that despite what the Hotel belleclaire says about the Manhatten diner accross from the hotel you should miss this restaurant. I found the staff incredibly rude and they made both myself and my partner feel very uncomfortable the one time that we did eat there. Avoid at all costs!

You can take that down to 42nd street station and catch a train to anywhere you want to go. A couple of late night eats were around the corner but they weren't that great. Anyway- the reason the price was so great is because you have to share a bathroom with two other rooms. There was one door that a key card would let you into that was just a hallway with 4 other doors, three rooms and a bathroom. We never had too much of a problem getting to use the bathroom whenever we wanted to. It was a bit of an adventure because a young couple had the room next to us and they wouldn't stop fighting for 3 days. The walls are very thin so we could hear a lot of what they we're saying. It really didn't bother us much though. We made a show of it because they kept fighting in the hall too. We looked out the peep hole for a couple good hours of laughs and entertainment. The rooms were very small moderately clean, thought we did kill a cockroach in the room one night. There is no view, just look out the window to a brick wall. The beds were comfortable and the linens appeared clean. Bottom line is if you are looking for a bed with a lock on the door and a low price and not much else, this place is for you.

The staff was extremely helpful with our last-minute booking. Not to mention that the shared bath was not as bad as I had expected. The bathroom was accessed by room cards only (shared between 3 rooms), and we never had a problem getting in. Also, the bathroom was very clean.

I went down to report the problem to the reception desk - leaving my boyfriend to hold off the beast of New York! By the time I arrived back at the room, there were two staff already there looking for the mouse and arranging for us to have a new room. That room was better than the first as it was slightly bigger and a better standard - still not much luggage space though - but it was okay and had no furry visitors! No problems sharing the bathroom as we never found it full. We stayed in a room with our own bathroom on the way back - it was a much nicer standard but not really worth paying an additional \u00a3100 for the two nights (\u00a3254 in all).

When checking in, one of the other couples were told that they had no reservation, but they had the booking email so they were given a room after 15 mins. When my boyfriend and I went to our room, on the 5th floor, we were shocked by the state of the corridor, there were pieces of furniture and large boxes all over, and we could barely pass by with our luggage, so we were fairly anxious about our room. however, our room had two double beds, really nicely decorated and even had a flatscreen TV and a little fridge. The bathroom was spotless, and our towels and bedlinen were changed every day. The room was a little warm, couldn't turn off the heat for some reason, but had air-con also. It was really comfortable and clean, which was all we wanted for our stay. The other 2 couples had only one bed in their rooms but paid the same rate, so i suppose we were just lucky.

There's also a gift shop at the entrance of the hotel, and the staff there were really helpful, they were able to arrange a bus for us back to the airport when we checked out, and the hotel stored our luggage for the day as we were flying out late that evening, so we could go get some more sights in.

We knew going there that the room was going to be small, but I guess I didn\u2019t realize just how small they could possibly make a room. Thankfully, we were never in the room much so it wasn\u2019t a problem. If you go to NY to stay in the room, then, this probably isn\u2019t the hotel for you. We only used the room to sleep and spent the majority of our time exploring the city. We stayed in a room with the shared bathroom which made me slightly nervous. I actually didn\u2019t tell my husband about it till we arrived cause I figured he\u2019d want to stay some place else, but I couldn\u2019t justify spending an extra $150+ per night just for a bathroom. But, all was good and we never had any problems. We never ran into any when we wanted in the bathroom and it was never dirty or gross. We did wake up early each morning and were out of the hotel by 8AM though. The only thing that we didn\u2019t like about the hotel is that it was SUPER hot in the room. Even though it was the middle of December, we had to sleep with the window up and it was still hot. The elevator was pretty small too, but we are young and healthy so we didn\u2019t mind walking the seven flights up to our room giving others a chance to ride on the elevator. The hotel is on the West Side and conveniently located near two subway stations. There is a 24 hour grocery store right around the corner along with some restaurants. We loved the pizza shop that was beside the subway station. Central Park is also only a couple of blocks away. Belleclaire is away from all the hustle and bustle of the city, but it is close enough to jump on the subway and be there in mere minutes. If it is your first time to the city, I would highly recommend trying out the Grayline bus tours. You can see a lot in a few days by hopping on and off the bus and any time. It is well-worth the cost. We were able to do the holiday lights tour (since it was around Christmas time) on the bus and it was awesome. We were able to cram in so many different landmark sites in just a few days by riding the bus. If you go to Central Park, take a carriage ride. It is pretty amazing. Also, purchase the metro card for the subway -you\u2019ll save $$. Overall, I would recommend the Hotel Belleclaire. It is a great budget hotel.

The hotel its self is a large corner plot on a main road. Some of the rooms I guess are noiser than others. I requested a quiet room online before I left and got exactly that. I had room 515 , it was a queen room with ensuite and was small but clean. The bedding and towles were changed every day and the room was spotless... It was also hot , real warm... I turned off the heating and its was just great , even though it was minus 6 outside !!! The staff were freindly and very helpful.. The liftswere small and slow but so what !! I requested a late check out and got one for 4.30 pm. Also the car servive back to JFK was well organised and reasonable value at $65 inc toll and tip. Its a great place , no spa , no pampering , no higrollers but after seeing the biger ( and more expensive ) hotels in and around 42 street I would reccommend tHe Belleclaire highly.. For $179 dollars for a private room on Manhatten I would find it hard to beat... sunshinebob", "Date": "December 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cA great find!\u201d", "Author": "alphatraveler", "ReviewID": "UR6321527", "Content": "We spent Thanksgiving week in NYC and stayed at the Hotel Belleclaire on the upper East side.

I chose the Belleclaire for the second time, after being so pleased after my first visit two years ago. The reviews I had read before the first trip on various websites were all pretty good apart from the odd one that complained about things such as the renovation that was being undertaken at that point in time and the odd dingy bathroom. I went not expecting a fantastic hotel but a basic, comfortable hotel and I was not let down in any way which is why I felt it was a good hotel to return to! We arrived at the hotel Belleclaire for our 5 night stay and were greeted by the doorman who pointed us to the reception in the lovely modern foyer. We were checked in quickly, with no problems then directed to our rooms which was only a few floors up. We waited for one of the lifts (there were two, both were small but never busy) and found our rooms with ease. We had booked a double room with a shared bathroom on a non-smoking floor, the room was offset into a corridor off a main corridor so it was nice and quiet. Our room shared a bathroom with two other rooms, but there was never a point when either my partner or myself went to use the bathroom and it was already in use. I feel that choosing a shared bathroom is a fantastic way to save money when staying at the Belleclaire .. Why spend money on having your own private bathroom when you can share one and have much more money to spend in those wonderful NYC shops! Once we arrived in our room I was pleased to find that it was of a decent size, was very clean and best of all .. the beds are probably the comfiest I've ever slept in, perfect after a hard day of New York life! In our room there was a TV, games, a fridge, a sink, a large storage cupboard, air con, radiators and your other basic bits and bobs that you would expect in a hotel room. The view wasn't fantastic (unless you really like brick walls) but there was a blind and curtains anyways so it wasn't like it was staring you in the face all day. Our rooms were cleaned and our beds made up daily which I've heard is uncommon in other budget hotels. The hotel didn't offer its own restaurant but did offer delivery from the fantastic restaurant/diner over the road. I do belive the restuarant is called simply the Manhattan Diner, and it is ideally situated for breakfast before a hard day shopping and sightseeing! The food is delicious and the service is the fastest and most efficient I've ever seen, add that to the bargainous prices and we have a winner. The hotel is situalted in a lovely little neighbourhood in the upper west side of Manhattan. Its quite quiet but only a short Journey from the hustle and bustle of the city. By foot, it is approximately 10 minutes to Central Park/Museum of Natural History and only 35 minutes walk from Times square. There is easy access to nearby subway stations, which make your jouneys all over NYC only a matter of minutes long .. I'd definately reccomend you use the subway in the afternoon when your feet start aching that little bit .. they will thank you later on! There are lots of nice local shops near the hotel and also a few small supermarkets to stock up on snacks and drinks for your hotel room. On our second stay in New York, when we left the hotel to walk into the city on our last day we were greeted with knee deep snow which was quite a shock! Little did we know we were about to be caught up in the biggest snowstorm NYC had seen in a long time. We called our pre-booked shuttle bus service to check that our transportation to the airport was still okay and they confirmed that everything should be fine. We checked out of our room and left our bags at the hotel whilst we went for some breakfast. Upon returning to the hotel we found out our transport to the airport had been delayed by hours so the hotel staff allowed us to set up camp in the foyer! Hours later we were eventually given the information that we would not be getting any transport via our pre-booked shuttle bus and that we had to make our own way there as it was not safe for such vehicles on the roads. The hotel staff were very helpful at this point and found us an alternate route to the airport (which involved walking, catching subways and busses and took a few hours) and gave us verbal and printed directions and timescales. If they hadn't been so helpful we would have probably still been there now! Overview: Hotel Belleclaire 250 W. 77th Street Corner of Broadway New York NY 10024 Basic, cheap and comfortable accomodation. Shared bathroom rooms are much better value. Close to subways and Central Park. Friendly, helpful staff. Nice neighbourhood.

We went for the shared bathroom accommodation and it was ok. Our room was one of three in it's own lobby behind a swipe card operated door. The reason for this is to keep our allocated bathroom for use only by 3 rooms. One downside to this was that there were now 2 extra doors banging whenever any of the other guests in our little area came through or used the bathroom. Some people seem happy to let doors swing shut loudly as opposed to closing them gently. Oh well. Our room overlooked the corner of 77th Street and Broadway and although it was on the 9th floor it was a bit noisy. New Yorkers love to use the horns on their cars! Also the local fire station was nearby which resulted in us being woken by loud sirens in the middle of the night a few times. We breakfasted at the Manhattan Diner opposite the hotel where you can get a filling breakfast for $5-\u00a36. The local subway is about 3 minutes away so getting to other areas was easy. There is a cinema about 5 minutes walk away. Central Park is nearby and genarally the area feels safe. Barnes and Noble bookstore is also about 5 minutes walk - a very nice shop.

The hotel is mentioned and recommended in many reputable guidebooks, such as the DK Eyewitness Travel Guide to New York (2006) and the Time Out New York guide (2006). Most of the TripAdvisor reviews have been favorable, and it was mainly on the TripAdvisor recommendations that we decided to book a queen-bed room with a shared bath for the rate of $129 per night... a real deal when compared with the going rate for other hotel rooms on the Upper West Side, all of which were asking $250-300 a night for similar lodging. We booked in July and received an e-mail confirmation the next day. Two weeks ago, prior to our arrival, I e-mailed the hotel and asked if they could give us a room away from the front of the hotel, since many TripAdvisor reviews mentioned loud street noise at night... something we would find hard to put up with. When we arrived at the hotel, we were given #524... our wish had been granted! You use your key to enter a door which leads to a small vestibule where rooms 523, 524, and 526 are located. The shared bath for these three rooms is located off the same vestibule. The room was small but perfectly clean, with a small sink in one corner, a closet with ironing board, iron, and extra blankets; a nice 19\" Samsung flat screen TV; and a utilitarian table and folding chair. A good supply of heavy cotton towels and a cotton bathmat were waiting on the table. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The room was completely quiet at night; the window opened onto an interior courtyard, and there was no street noise whatsoever. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept in, with nice thick pillows and a warm comforter. New York was sunny and cool during our stay, so we used the AC unit fan to bring in fresh air from the outside, since the window did not open. The air was refreshing, and even the low hum of the fan was a pleasant \"white noise\" which aided sleep. The shared bath was SPOTLESSLY CLEAN at all times. Only once did we encounter other guests on their way in or out of it. We could only deduce that the hotel staff keeps a close eye on the shared baths and ensures that they remain clean. Water pressure from the shower was good, hot water plentiful. The hotel staff are cordial, friendly, and accommodating. A doorman greeted us and held the door nearly every time we entered or left the buliding. As many TripAdvisor members have mentioned, the Manhattan Diner is on the NE corner of 77th and Broadway, just steps away from the hotel entrance, and you can't find a better place in the neighborhood for a hearty breakfast. We often selected the #5 breakfast: two eggs any style; a choice of bacon, ham, or sausage; toast, butter, and jam; a substantial glass of orange juice; and unlimited cups of excellent coffee... all for $5.95. The menu is extensive, and you could easily have all your meals here for a very low price. Around the corner on Broadway, just a few feet south of the hotel, the Westside Market offers a full line of groceries as well as beer & wine, cheeses, breads, deli salads, and even sandwiches for take-away. It's a fabulous place to buy food and supplies. If you were on a tight budget, you could put together a wonderful meal just from this market and enjoy it right in your room. Our room was small, with not much space to move around the perimeter of the bed. But we used the room only to sleep, and with a rate of only $129 per night, we felt that we had made the perfect choice. We easily saved $125 to $150 a night, and the savings were spent on theatre tickets, museums, and restaurants. Staying here is very much like staying in a tourist-class hotel in Europe.

I would select for economical reasons, perhaps, Milford Plaza or Hotel Edison. Friends of mine have stayed there and enjoyed themselves. HOTEL BELLECLAIRE: The hotel is small and currently being renovated on some floors. My senior mother and I could have cared less about the elevators. We were on the third floor and used the stairwell. In my opinion, this is not a place for children or teens. The hotel rooms are small, the televisions barely work, but that being said, it was fine for us. Honestly, I think it depends on what you are looking for. We did reject one of the bigger rooms on the 7th floor because the carpet was badly stained. The front desk is friendly and accomodating and changed our room immediately. My mother's room and mine were both clean (315 and 318). The view was nonexistent and the air conditioners rather loud. The bathrooms were spotless; no problem with hot water and I think the tile was new. The bed was comfortable and I smelled no unpleasant odors. I have a nose for mold, mildew, and other unpleasantries.....every thing was fine. I also have trouble sleeping at night, but found no problem here. It is an older place, however, the paint is fresh, a brownish-yellow, and the carpet looks somewhat newish. The halls are narrow, if you are on the big side, hmm.....find a bigger place. I noticed that there were a lot of airline staff who stayed here as well. The location, for me, was excellent. I wanted to stay in a residental area, to see more of the REAL New York, and so I did. The subway is two blocks away and you can get to Times Square in five minutes if you have two dollars. Not a bad deal! The area is safe, too. Just around the corner is a grocery store, with a huge selection of cheeses, chocolates, deli items, and imported beers. There is a great \"trendy\" breakfast place on Amsterdam called Sara Beth's. It is a local favorite and if you want a good Jewish breakfast, somewhere on Broadway (that's your street) and hmmm......86 or 87, you can find incredibly fresh lox, herring, etc. If you ask, once you get to that area, people would know the name.

After complaining, we were offered a room on a different floor; the new room had the same standard as the old one, but was smaller and had a window to the backyard. We were told that our original room was the only \"larger economy\" room, so we decided to stay there in spite of the noise.

My last visit was 5 days over the Fourth of July, 2005, still $99 dollars. It was hot and humid outside, but the window A/C kept the room cool. The shared bathroom overlooked a grungy air shaft, but it was clean and somewhat modern, and the view out the window was a slice of busy Broadway. I got up to the roof and was rewarded with a great view of The Hudson and the northern stretch of Broadway. The best part of staying there is the neighborhood. The Upper West Side has become my favorite place to explore,thanks to the Belleclaire's great location. Food choices abound, transportation is a snap and the shops are as varied as Midtown.

I told the agent the amount we were quoted and he said that my amount was totally incorrect and in no way would anyone quote that. However, when I whipped out a printout of an email sent to me by the \"Reservations Manager\" with the original quote, let's just say the upper hand had changed.

Be advised that despite this issue, (which can be simply avoided by getting an emailed copy of your total rates including taxes) we enjoyed our stay at the Belleclaire. All the bellmen we encoutered were very helpful and very polite. The rooms were clean and everytime we called the desk with requests, they were answered immediately. yes the elevators are small to fit barely one person and their luggage, however, that's what the bellmen are for so just ask. They have a freight elevator to handle that issue. The room we stayed in contained a fridge, iron, cd alarm clock, tiny dresser, closet, hair dryer, and even liquid soaps, lotions, shampoos, and conditioner. The neighborhood surrounding the hotel is awesome. Safe quiet, and far enough from the touristy Times Square area. There are also lots of shops and restaurants a few steps away from the hotel. The subway is a little more than a block away- I would suggest using it since cabs can get pricey if you're hanging out in the lower areas of manhattan like we did.

Also provided were tv, iron/ironing board, refrigerator, and in-room sink. Would have been nice to have a comfortable chair in the room.

One we had got into the lobby, it was very pleasant and the reception area looked very nice. They had a gift shop on site that you could log on to the internet. it was $3 for 15 mins. They sold all kinds of New York gifts and merchandise. They also sold tickets to tours, and can book the transfers to from JFK airport for you. Talk to the guy in the shop and he can give you Macys passes and can give you friendly advice about clubs, bars, pubs to go to etc... Aparently the 3rd floor had fire damage to it, that is why the scaffolding is there. They are refurbishing the hotel. We checked in with ease, and the staff were quite helpful. You have to sign an agreement and give over your credit or debit card to cover any events or charges that may occur (phone, extra nights etc...) and it says you must check out by 12.00pm otherwise you get charged for an extra nights stay. The Hotel had three lifts that you could use to go up to your floor. Sometimes the workmen would use them so we had to wait for another one, or use one of the others. We stayed on the 8th floor (the hotel had 10 floors). The room number was 814 and it was a double room with en suite bathroom. (toilet, bath, shower). Quite small though, and it took quite a while for the hot water to come through. Some of the tiles on the floor were a bit grubby but nothing to bad. It had a nice double bed and a TV with satelite. (MTV, Comedy, Childrens etc...) at no extra charge. The view was a bit constricted, but the room itself was pleasant and spacious. It had a dressing table, Wall mirror and a wardrobe with an iron, and a hair dryer. Also the room had a fridge in it (full sized). You could order room service if you wanted to. As for the location of the Hotel we found that it wasnt bad, but was quite some trek from all the main attractions. Most of the time we walked, but we got the yellow cabs sometimes. Central park is a short walk away down West 77th Street. The Restaurants we recommend in close proximity to the Hotel are the Manhatten Diner (Directly opposite), and the Cafe 52 which is just a short walk down from the Manhatten Diner. It was actually my 21st Birthday whilst we were in New York, so we went to the Tavern on the Green which was at 66th street, West Central park. Beautiful Restaurant! Nice surroundings. And the food was delicious. Some things not to miss whilst in New York are:- A Horse and carridge ride around Central Park (Try to find the Horse named Billie, he was a saint!) And do a deluxe ride for about $75. Also you have to try Ice skating. We skated at the Wollman Rink and it cost about $24. A Helicopter tour (we had one pre-booked) With Liberty Helicopters on 30th street. This was about \u00a333 each for a 10 minute ride taking in the statue of liberty, the bronx, Central park, the empire state building, manhatten and the Stadiums! Take a City Sites tour starting at Times Square its a hop on hop off bus tour that takes in everything! It was Brilliant. The company we went with were City Sights. Jose was our guide and he was very funny! And factual of New York. Of course there is the Staue of Liberty, Times Square, Empire State Building, Bloomingdales, Macys, The Chrysler Building, Grand Central Station, The UN head quaters, The Rockefeller Centre and Central Park to name but a few.

I had several concerns about the quality of the room we rented over the internet and the subsequent disinterest of the management staff to rectify our complaints. When we arrived at the hotel on Tuesday the 21st we checked into room 228. Sadly, the room that we had anticipated being a two room family suite was nothing of the sort. We were shocked to see how small the rooms were and that there was no sitting area that would define a suite. We had to climb OVER the bed in the first \u201croom\u201d in order to access the bathroom and there was very little space to set up a crib for my infant son. Not only were we disappointed that there was no common area between the rooms, but we were shocked at how sticky the carpet was. The mold on the bathroom shower curtain and the stains on the alarm clock speaker were disgusting. Furthermore, the window air conditioning unit had only two settings: off or freezing cold and was unacceptably loud. Our first morning in New York I spoke to the desk clerk who assured me that we could move to a larger suite. When we returned from our day of sightseeing, I was told that the hotel was sold out and a move was impossible. (How could such a terrible hotel be sold out?) The reservations manager cared very little about our complaints, was condescending and had no desire to meet her customer\u2019s needs. My attempts to speak with the General Manager went unanswered. We left several messages for her, including a cellphone number where we could be reached, and not once did she make an attempt to contact us in order to avoid this issue being brought to the owner's attention. Who, by the way, ignored my letter of complaint. We are reasonable people and simply wanted to be moved to a room that reflected the price we paid for the accommodations, as advertised.

Just a few minutes away from the Subway though, with a great supermarket round the corner, as well as loads of shops, diners - don't miss Gray's Papaya and H&H Bagels just 3 blocks away! The area didn't seem very rough at all. ROOMS Rooms were spacious enough, not too small or too big and with a fridge, all the usual - ironing board, hair dryer, cable TV. Do not expect great views but the room was very clean and functional. Fridge was especially handy, and there was an air-conditioning machine which was handy for the humid nights. Shared bathroom was not a problem, or noise but I guess my neighbours were courteous which may not be everybody's experience. SERVICE No problems here - everything that I'd asked about was efficiently answered and I even got a complimentary travel plug! AMENITIES Small gym located on the 1st floor, which I didn't use but had a quick look round. Again, functional for most people's needs with a dumbell rack, cardio and weights machines. No restaurant.

Technically, this was accurate. However, the rooms, bathroom and closet (yes, only one closet) combined were smaller in area than many single hotel rooms. Although the suite was supposed to be able to house up to 5 people, it was cramped for our 3 adults and one child. If we hadn't pre-paid for four days, we would have walked out and taken our chances elsewhere. The bathroom is accessible only through one of the rooms; if someone in the other room needs to get up in the middle of the night, he has to walk into the sleeping person's room. The closet is in the other room. The two rooms had a total of three small drawers, ONE chair, and NO box of tissues. There were none of the amenities one expects from just about any hotel these days -- coffeemaker, continental breakfast, etc. There was a small refrigerator, but no microwave, and no sink except the one in the bathroom. Let's talk about the bathroom. Among the 3 adults with us, we had experienced literally hundreds of hotels on four continents over at least five decades. This bathroom easily won the prize for the smallest and least user-friendly ever. The sink is so tiny that you can't help splashing water on the floor just by turning on the faucet. There is ONE towel bar (to hold enough towels for up to 5 people?) and ONE hook behind the door, no shelves, even within the shower area (to put one's shampoo and such). The fan was broken from the moment we arrived. We told the people at the front desk, who said they'd send someone up to look at it. Maybe they did, while we were out, but all they did was look; it was never fixed in the time we were there. Generally speaking, it was a dump -- who gave this place 3 stars? The window unit air conditioners were junky; not only were they mismatched and unattractive, but they made loud clanking and knocking noises all night. There was a hole in the wall of one room. (I once stayed in a German hotel that was about this bad -- I think there was a blood stain on the wall -- but it cost only about one-fifth what this place cost!) The clientele was the best part. We shared elevators with such a variety of characters! There were the two young \"ladies\" who used profanity in front of our 11-year-old, and the father who took his child out of her stroller and then didn't have the courtesy to fold up the stroller to make room for another person (and I believe several other reviews have mentioned how small the elevators are).

The hallways were very musty and devoid of oxygen. We eventually found our room (all 100 square feet of it) at the back of the hotel, and it was scary. A few \"features\": filthy carpets with black stains, no dresser, that fresh \"uriny\" smell, stained acoustic panels above the bed, a dented mini-fridge, and a tiny AC unit sticking out of the window that made more noise than a Kindergarten class at recess but failed to cool the sweltering room.

But we decided on the Belleclaire mainly because there was 3 of us, all male adults, and it worked out alot cheaper booking one of the hotels suites with 3 seperate beds than it did using another hotel and having to book at least 2 rooms. After a nervy 15 minutes at check-in while they found our booking! it all went rather well. Clean room and bathroom with plenty of towels, 2 single beds and 1 double bed, the double being in a seperate area of the suite, 2 T.V's, ironing board and iron, and enough space to pitch a 3 man tent (its true)! The location was just about right aswel. Just off Broadway, so not to noisy, and about a 10-15 minute walk to Times Square. Also near a main subway stop, i've forgot which one but we got to everywhere we wanted to from it. Also not to far from the park (just in case).

The beds were comfy, the cleaning service was impeccable and it was actually pretty private. The location is ideal. So close to so many fabulous things. Good food (particularly Zen Palate across the street), easy access to subway and Central Park...It was a very clean and safe neighborhood and we were really able to get a good sense of non-touristy New York.

The Hotel decor in the lobby is extremely attractive, and our room was small (hey, its New York after all), quite plain but clean, tidy and comfortable. The air conditioner however sounded like a Boeing 747 taking off when turned on. We stayed in a room with a shared bathroom with about 4 other rooms, which we were quite uneasy about initially, but were relieved with the cleanliness of the dated but functional bathroom. The hotel is excellently positioned on W 77th Street, and if you feel energetic (and its hard not to in this town), its a good walk down to Times Square. It is only a 3 block walk to the Museum of Natural History and the Gray Line NYC sight seeing tour pick up point. An excellent diner (The Manhattan Diner) is located across the street corner from the hotel. Internet is available in the concierge room for a pricey $3.00 per 15 minutes. A better bet is a little copy shop next to the Manhattan Diner which charges $2.00 per 15 mins.

The location was excellent - the hotel itself, quirky. I'd read that it had recently been totally renovated, but the walls of our room had scuff marks and paint smears on them. There's not a single piece of artwork on the walls, either, which renders the hotel very stark. The window airconditioning units do keep the place very cool, though, and drown out the noise of the city. The beds were extremely comfortable. The TV only got about 5 channels. There was no wastebasket in the room, just a tiny one in the bathroom. And although our beds were made and we got clean towels, there was no sign of maid service. Without a wastebasket, we had piled up a few shopping bags, which we filled with coffee cups, sugar packets, brochures we no longer needed, etc., and those remained on the floor throughout our stay. Our belongings weren't tidied up, nor was the bathroom cleaned. The staff at the front desk were relatively helpful, but acted as though they were in a far fancier establishment. When I inquired about a local restaurant, I was told I'd need to speak to \"the concierge,\" who turned out to be a girl of about 20 who had a notebook with restaurant menus in it. When we arrived, there was a big to-do about \"summoning the bellman\" to take our two tiny roll-on bags upstairs for us. Yet, when I requested a bottle opener, the \"concierge\" said she'd have one delivered to my room, but never did. When I inquired about it the following day, she waid \"Well, we didn't have one, so that's why we didn't bring it.\" This is a hotel that has quite a few pretentions it doesn't live up to.
