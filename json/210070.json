But then so so many other hotels. It is reasonably priced. But then again so are many other hotels. The staff is friendly, but then again so is the staff at any number of other hotels. London's easy to maneuver in, so I don't require a hand-holding staff. The hotel is indeed quaint, on the outside. Inside, it is dilapidated. Utterly. The rooms are small, so what, but they are also dingy approaching dirty. I also don't mind walking up four flights of stairs, but can the \"friendly\" staff help a bit. The halls are often filled with dirty laundry - room cleaning seems to go on all day. Finally for the breakfast. It is indeed hardy. But it is also quite poor. Coffee is weak, and the rest of the food largely inedible.

The location simply can\u2019t get any better \u2013 it\u2019s on the quiet street behind Marble Arch, which guarantees you a good night sleep and at the same time it\u2019s literally seconds away from Oxford Street. Bus stop is right across the street. When out of Marble Arch tube station take right and in about a minute there will be a mini market and a pharmacy. I\u2019ve been to few different single rooms. The bed is very very comfortable, even more so the pillows are too, which is a total plus for me with my neck. They clean the room every day, there\u2019s always a change of towels. In the single room there are a bed, a wardrobe, TVset (lots of channels), 2 drawer units, a kettle, tea bags and all sorts of tea/coffee making stuff. Simple? Yes! But what more do you need? Someone said about cracks on the walls, I saw it in one of the rooms, but it wasn\u2019t big and there was nothing falling off. You have to be reasonable, it\u2019s not 5 stars plus if you\u2019re coming to London to sit in the hotel and look at the walls then there\u2019s something wrong there. Having said that I did notice some improvements and repairs done in one of the room between my 2 trips, so they do some work. Single rooms are not en-suite, the bathroom and a shower are on the floor. I do have to say that bathroom / shower on the first floor is much better than one on the higher floor, where there\u2019s a bathtub instead of a shower cabin and the shower is handheld \u2013 that is inconvenient, but you manage. Also it is less modern, but both were always very clean, there was always hot water, very strong pressure. I usually didn\u2019t have to wait, maybe once for about 10 minutes because it was occupied There is little cozy lounge with free Internet, very convenient and also rarely you have to wait for long since there\u2019s a 15 minutes rule, if no one\u2019s waiting you can use it for longer. The breakfast room is small but very cozy, there might be some waiting involved when they\u2019re fully booked and everyone goes for breakfast at the same time, but you never have to wait longer than 5-10 minutes. The breakfast itself smells so good, that if you\u2019re staying in the room on the first floor it\u2019ll get you out of the bed :) There\u2019s apple/orange juice, coffee, milk, lots of choice of cereals, the [very well] cooked breakfast of your choice out of menu (sausages, tomatoes, beans, eggs, bacon). The staff and ladies at the reception are very friendly, very helpful, always there, always greet you with a smile, even when you arrive after midnight. There a safe and I felt very safe leaving my documents with them. There\u2019s a book shelf and you can help yourself out, just don\u2019t forget to put it back :) I once had mail delivered to hotel like weeks before arrival and they kept it for me with no problem. I travel a lot and always on a budget and there are 4 main things that count for me when I choose my accommodation: clean sheets/towels (comfy bed is always a plus), hot water, location and affordable price and at Edward Lear you get that plus a delicious breakfast and friendly people who work there.

However, when we returned this past April of 2010, we were sadly disappointed to find it was even more run down, downgraded in bathrooms to tiny box shower stalls, tired drawing and breakfast rooms, and steps that tilted even more dangerously than before. It is still a good value with excellent location right on Marble Arch in front of Hyde Park and the full breakfasts are still ever so helpful but the inn seems to have degraded in value and badly needs updating and renovations. The rooms overheated and the beds were difficult to sleep in due to the heat and the memory foam insulation mattresses adding to the heat. If you are all right with that and no air conditioning or very high heating in the winters, it's good for someone on a very tight budget.

Each stay has been 10-14 days. I've always been perfectly happy there. I find it sparkly clean, quirky, charming, extremely convenient and comfortable enough. It's a really authentic place to stay instead of a homogenised hotel that you could find anywhere in the world. A man I was talking to at the breakfast table put it best: he said he wanted to stay somewhere that had that touch of Fawlty Towers. Exactly. Basil Fawlty is nowhere to be seen but the building used to be a private home and has been split up, probably numerous times, for accommodation and that's where the slight eccentricity can come in. I've always stayed in a single room with shared bathroom so have no experience with the self contained rooms but it's always worked for me. I highly recommend the downstairs bathroom, next door to the breakfast room. It has the best shower. I find the staff friendly and helpful, the breakfasts delicious and amazing considering they're included in the very modest fee, the location truly excellent. I still haven't been on the tube even though Marble Arch is just around the corner; I just walk everywhere, that's how convenient the location is. There's no elevator so you have to haul your suitcase upstairs- well if I can do it anyone can. I don't travel lightly. There's no air con in Summer, which is when I stay but it's an old substantial building and well insulated. And you can always open a window. The quality of your stay can be affected by the consideration of your fellow guests. Sometimes people come in late and slam the front door. Big deal. I have heard someone say they thought the rooms were a bit noisy from the traffic on the road at the front. I'm an insomniac and I've stayed in rooms at the front and the back and I can't say I've been bothered by noise. You can ask for a room at the back, which will look out at a mews or buy some earplugs at Boots around the corner. Everything is basically round the corner from the Edward Lear. Look, it's not fancy and if you're accustomed to luxury and have deep pockets Edward Lear may not be for you.

We found the hotel a little hard to find at the start, and we were a bit apprehensive when we saw how close it was to Oxford Street, but it is quite remote and very charming on arrival. It looks like a country house from outside. Reception is at the back of the hotel. I found the staff very friendly, and when we were leaving, they allowed us to leave our bags in reception while we went to get lunch and take in a few more sights before we headed to the airport instead of hauling out bags around. Our room was very basic, although we were there in the height of winter and with single pain windows, it got quite cold, but there were spare blankets in the cupboard.

Given the price of everything in England, at 125 pounds per night B&B for the four of us, we really didn't have high expectations for the Edward Lear. Fortunately, we were very pleasantly surprised. Having read prior reviews of this hotel, I have to agree - the corridors are narrow, the stairs are slanted and crooked, but so what? If you want posh, then pay posh and stay posh. We were on the second floor in a 'family room' with a double bed and two single beds. Our room was immaculate, the beds were extremely comfortable (memory foam mattresses - MMmmmm!), the ensuite bathroom was brand new with a properly flushing toilet and good pressure in the shower. There was lots of lighting, lots of drawers and closet space, and lots of tea/coffee/hot chocolate etc. in the room for our use. In short, our room had no faults that we could detect, and was, in fact, much nicer than some for which we had paid more. The staff at the hotel were all extremely pleasant and very willing to assist with any inquiries that we had. Breakfast was served in a small breakfast room that was very clean and sunny. Some people had to sit with strangers at their table, but, again, so what? It's breakfast! You're travelling! Meet new people! We were a party of four, so didn't have the opportunity to do that, but would have welcomed it if it was necessary. The food was lovely with breakfast for each of us being made to order, and served promptly from a charming dumb waiter coming up from the kitchen.

As a frame of reference, we do not, nor can we afford to stay at more costly hotels. What we seek is clean, cheap and convenient to the locations we want to explore. As an example, we have stayed at Hotel Harrington while in Washington DC. in September 07 Edward Lear is a small older hotel converted from a Victorian residence, and we were originally concerned because it is a five story walk-up (no elevators) The there is only one room in the category we booked..a single standard (shared bath) . It was a large room with two single beds separated by a nightstand. It's located on the first floor!...We weren't told this when we booked, but we were very pleased, because we had asked for a lower floor; (we're in our 50s and 60s and not into jaunting up 1 flight, let alone 5!) Serendipity! Ask for room number 3. It did have a sink in a closet. Other amenities in the room included a phone, very small TV which was a bit two far from the beds, though we didn't watch much anyway. There were no chairs - given the size of the room, at least one would have been good, and two would have fit. There was a small stand with an electric coffee/tea pot well stocked with tea, coffee, sugar and creamers. There was a small closet which held what we had brought easily. The window in the room offered no view - just light in the day..and looked out over the basement kitchen glass ceiling...and thats about it. The shared bath was right down the hall...only two other rooms on that floor...and during the whole time i only ran into one fellow bather who got to me just ahead. It's small, with a shower...towels seemed to pile up during the day on the floor as there was no place to deposit a dirty one. The three rooms share the floor with the front desk, computer room, ( which gets busy in the morning and evening..plan to wait if you didnt bring a lap top) I was amazed at how quiet the hotel seemed. We got good nights rest, every night of our stay, and only once heard someone come in late. Housekeeping was done every day while we were out with no issues at all. Everything was refreshed, replenished, and straightened. Staff was congenial and helpful when we needed information. The breakfast is huge...nicely presented, and well cooked. As an American, the tomatoes and beans threw me off, but i got right into them, and by the end, ate the whole thing!...There are only 6 tables (four tops) in the dining room, which is smallish, and served by a dumb waiter from the basement kitchen. We got started early each day..weekdays it opened at 7 30 and weekends 8 am. Table is set with LARGE trivets upon which your plate is set..sort of balanced...I thought that was funny..also, more silverware than is needed...an extra knife - for butter and jam, etc..but crowded the table. There is also a selection of juices, milk, cereals, etc. Locationally, we couldn't have asked for better..great shopping is very near by..Selfridge's right around the corner..don't miss it - you can walk. Hyde park and Marble arch tube is a block away. There is a movie house around the corner as well....an Odeon we were shocked that we were asked to select seats based on price, and proximity..take the cheap seats...the theaters are small. Gay gents - the Quebec bar, London's oldest , since 1946, is in the next block...(and some of the original client\u00e8le were there the two nights we stopped in). For Americans, we paid the equivalent of 7dollars for a large coke, and 6 for an equal size beer..go figure. Take the tube to Leicester Square, check out the cheap theater ticks (go to the official booth which is a stand alone building in the square, not around the perimeter) We saw Spamalot and had a great time. From Leicester, walk over to Soho for lots of other bars...and drinking in the street...everywhere in London, pubs spilled out with people drinking in the street. Try the Geisha Bar for upscale decor, and very quiet. next door is a more typical bar catering to all kinds of gents. We didn't venture further - we could have all night..bars are open apparently 24 hours. We purchased a London Pass...we feel we did well with saving on some of the attractions. Check it out...and take the transportation option - you will save even more. Practically speaking, we were able to do about 3 major things a day on it, by hustling.
