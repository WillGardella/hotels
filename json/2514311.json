The location is fantastic - Times Square is literally right around the corner (a 1 minute walk) and the blue and red metro lines are both located less than 20 metres from the hotel door. It is a great central spot where you are equal distance from downtown and uptown Manhattan. I also found the reception desk very helpful - they offered me a map when I arrived, took my bags to and from the taxi and were generally very pleasant to deal with. Two small issues: the heating in my room was a little inconsistent and I did have to place a call to reception to investigate the problem. However this was fixed within half and hour. The rooms also do not have wifi, however there is a Starbucks 1 block away with free wifi access. When I return to Manhattan, I will definitely stay at the Amsterdam Court.

They assured us that the housekeeping manager would go right up there so we went out to explore the city. When we returned 3 hours later the hair was still there. On to my room. Although there was no hair decorations the heat just about killed us and there was no way to control the 200 year old radiator. I had the run the A/C at full blast and it was still too hot. There were sharp springs sticking out of the side of my mattress which we scratched ourselves on several times. Since there was no manager in the building at any time there seemed no point in complaining. The last straw was after the incredibly lame breakfast we returned to our room on the third floor and the maid was in the hall smoking butts. It smelled so bad and looked so incredibley tacky I was appalled that my 10 year old daughter had to see this.

Fearful this would happen to us, it certainly did and to 5 people total that night. Our experience was shady at the least and an unsuccessful scam attempt because we watched and listened to every move. Our front desk attendant, Natalie Garcia, was the epitome of poor customer service at the mercy of her management to scam customers into paying full price for a room. We booked through booking.com. Natalie said they couldn't find the reservation in the system. About 30 minutes later, it appeared but the dates they had were incorrect ( one night off). I confirmed the correct dates shown in my Droid email confirmation. That should have stopped right here and we should have checked into our room. Then we had to wait while they called booking.com to discuss. Booking.com wanted to fax a correction but THE FAX WAS BROKEN! Booking.com then offered to email the new reservation to the hotel email. Natalie then provided her personal gmail account to receive the email. When questioned she didn't see anything wrong with this. she was aslo going to take another customers information home to fax to England bc the fax was broken! Are you kidding me! Natalie never did check her personal email and I started to smell identity theft. Natalie then offered us a \"quoted\" room for the original discounted price per her managers approval who was now taking calls at home. However we still had to deal with booking.com to cancel our original reservation. We declined thus quote and called booking.com and they told us the front desk needed to give an ok to cancel the reservation! We then dis ANOTHER go around of them now not being able to find us in the system when we were just up on the screen and they could not reference anything to give the ok to he woman on the phone. After pushing the new staff attendant, Chris, he miraculously found us in the system to cancel the reservation. What a nightmare!

The latch to lock the window was not functional because the air conditioner unit was sitting in the window, so the window could be opened freely from inside or outside. Once I opened the window, I could see it opened up into type of storage room. This room held extra materials such as carpet and tiles. It also had a steel door which appeared to exit into another part of the hotel. The hotel's solution was to give us all a free breakfast. We declined their breakfast and when we returned back from breakfast, we went to our room to make sure we hadn't forgotten anything and we looked one more time at the window.

So I restricted my hotel search to the same areas for convenience. That's why I chose Amsterdam Court on booking.com, based on my main criteria of location, price, and Trip Advisor reviews. I was assigned a room with a partial view of Broadway (nice!). I was pleased with the location and the price I paid for it (alright!). And the bed was comfortable and room fairly clean in general (perfect!). Unfortunately, everything else fell short. Space was quite tight and was exacerbated by the odd shape of the room; one corner of the room was blocked by the TV and the TV stand. It was also poorly lighted and the window A/C unit noisy. Breakfast and wifi were extra which I did not avail of. I was also surprised that bulky TV sets were still used in big city hotels like this one. I did not mind my situation too much because I had a packed itinerary and only used the room to come home to at night.

For comparison purposes other Times Square area hotels are in the $350-400/night range (Marriott, Sheraton, Hilton, etc.). There is construction next door where a new building is going up. My 1st room was 427 and on the side of the building where the construction is. Construction was on-going when I checked in and the jack-hammering was intense. I went downstairs and talked to Natalie about another room. She promptly moved me from a standard to a deluxe King bedroom without hesitation. The standard room was tight, but adequate. The deluxe King was more spacious relatively speaking. If you're used to Court Yard, Marriott, Hilton, etc. sized rooms you'll be disappointed, but remember they are 2 times the $$. The rooms, halls, stairs, windows, and air conditioners are all outdated. The wallpaper is dark, the carpet is worn in the halls, the lighting is dim, and the furniture is worn. The windows don't seal tight to keep noise out. It wouldn't matter anyways because the air-conditioning is an in-window type which means one of the windows is halfway open to accommodate the unit and the noise comes right in. (Hint: turn on the AC to Fan only and create some white-noise to block out the city if you need to) Just because it is a bit dark and worn doesn't mean that it is dirty. The place is clean, the rooms are comfortable, the bathroom is clean, has good water pressure and plenty of hot water. The iron works, the hair dryer works, the TV is fine and the bed is comfortable.

The room was really hot, no way to make it cooler. We had to open the window at night, which isn't advised in NYC. The reason the room is so hot is because hot water boiler is just below the room we were in (206). Taking a shower was a nightmare!! The hot water is scalding hot and we couldn't even touch the nobs. There was no way to get a good temperature...it was either scalding hot or freezing cold, never anything in between. We left it on for 20 min, tried adjusting the temperature using the sink taps at the same time, still no avail. The staff were accomodating enough. They weren't super nice, but would always help out when asked. Other downsides: You have to pay $10/day for wi-fi and $10/day for breakfast which consists of cereal, some pastries, coffee/tea. We just walked around the corner to the local deli instead. Bed was nice, cleaned everyday. That's about the only good thing. The bar downstairs was being renovated on during the day but open at night, and they served good drinks and service was good. We didn't try the sushi restaurant also attached.

Well, of course! The staff at this hotel spends all day calming the guests down while shuffling them to different rooms. We had booked and PAID for our room over a month in advance after finding it through bookit.com as a \"Mystery Hotel\". On the day of our arrival from Canada we called the hotel to let them know we'd be arriving late due to the train schedule. \"No problem\" replied the hotel. When we arrived at the hotel 10:30pm, imagine our delight when the front desk lady told us they had no rooms available!!! They said they could pay for a cab to take us to a nearby hotel. After my wife hit the ceiling, they \"found\" another smaller room to put us in. You could barely get the door open to find a twin bed. And no...they weren't kidding. Being that this was part of our first anniversary, I got to see my bride transform into someone that would make the Alien jump off the ship. In NYC they CAN hear you scream! Guess what? They somehow \"found\" a larger room for us that night and promised to get us into an even larger room the next day. They also comped our continental breakfast in the morning (paying $10 each for toast, cereal and some fruit seemed a ripoff anyway). The larger room proved to be bearable, but don't try to pass each other by the side of the bed. It ain't happening. The bathrooms don't have vent fans, so use caution if you enjoy Mexican food.

Our first morning there we awoke to drilling/banging from the building site next door. This started at approx 0700. When speaking to the hotel staff they were surpirsed by the builiding works and had no knowledge of them happening, which on the face of it seemed a little strange as the building had obviously been in the demotiliton stages for weeks/months. The lady on reception who I cannot remember her name was very helpful and arranged for us to be moved to a quieter room. This happened with no fuss and I am glad we did complain. we got a quieter, bigger, cleaner room. The room was not made up for 2 nights though, am unsure why? And the room did get hot, the air conditioning was very noisy. There were 2 lifts, 1 worked and was very slow due to the high volume of traffic. We were told at reception that the out of order lift was a recent event and would be fixed by the end of the day. On speaking to other staff members the lift had been out of action for 6 months, and the lift still wasnt working when we left (after a 4 night stay). You could see the hotel is run down and is in the process of having works done to improve. As I say, great location, friendly and helpful staff. At a push I would stay there again but there would need to be improvements. I should have known though by the price. You really do get what you pay for. There was a happy hour in the bar which we didnt try due to it being busy, there is also a japanese restaurant attached which again was also always busy.

The room was clean and provided what we needed for our stay. Bad Points: If you want a good nights sleep avoid this hotel. Me and my partner are both heavy sleepers and even we could not sleep through the horrendous noise all the showers in the hotel made. This noise being heard during our stay anywhere between 4:30am and 11:00am in the morning. If a shower was being used in a room above or next to ours the room vibrated also. And the noise was that loud on some occasions that we could not even hear the television. (please see videos) With us requesting a non-smoking room we were surprised that we had been placed on a floor with smoking rooms. This meant that on most days when we got back to the hotel we had to put up with a strong smell of smoke both inside and outside our room. And on a few nights this resulted in us having to put towels at the bottom of the door to try and prevent the smoke from getting into our room. And upon returning to the UK i have has to wash everything we took and even the clothes we bought as souvenirs to remove this smell. Overall: The staff were helpful and pleasant, but were under a lot of pressure due to limited staff resources. And the hotel and the rooms did not reflect the price we paid and we were disappointed by the noise and lack of sleep that occured from staying here. We would not recommend staying in this hotel to anyone else and will not be staying there again. Tips: We were not told upon arrival where you obtained the complementary tea and coffee from in the hotel, this is located downstairs past reception and through a corridor located next to the main lift. There is also a pay as you go internet computer located in this room for 25cents a minute $1 for 5 minutes.

The only complaints: I was there over a couple cool spring days and coming in at the end of the day I was fairly chilled, hoping for a warm room. It was very cold in the room and the front desk said the heat only turns on if it's under 50 degrees outside (and it must have been 51 then because it was cool!) Without individual thermostats in the room, I had to just request extra blankets. Also, the walls are thin, so if people are coming in and out of the rooms around you or talking in the hall, you can easily hear it and be woken up. But in general, the room was clean and absolutely sufficient for my needs. I think it might have been a bit tight if I traveled with a companion (the king bed pretty much takes up the whole room) but for the price and location, I would recommend it.

After a awful start (Delta cancelled our flight after leaving us waiting at the airport literally all day) we finally got here and were really pleased with our choice of hotel. A very kind American in the UK let us use her mobile to call the hotel to tell them that we would not make it that night and they were great and said it was no problem - we had already paid. They were great when we arrived and got us checked in quick. If you need a taxi or any help they were very obliging and helpful. When we arrived at JFK we got on the airtrain line that takes you out to the city (LIRR) which was easy to use and not expensive. Once we got to the subway station we were a wee bit unsure and had been planning to walk but we got chatting to a chap on the LIRR and he said he was going in the same direction as us and said it was a fair walk so best to take the subway. He very kindly helped us buy tickets out of a machine (we got a 10 trip ticket I think) and off we went. Once we got to our destination (he indicated which was our stop but you can see it clearly if you get a good map - we used the lonely planet guide for getting about when we were there) we just walked up the stairs and we were at the corner of the street for the hotel. We actually managed to walk past the hotel as the entrance is quite small and the signage is discrete. If you see the next subway station (next to Subway the sandwich place) you have gone too far if you have come up at the top corner - can't now recall which avenue end the subway station is that we came up. A quick walk back along and you'll find it though and you should be able to see a theatre to your right if you have your back to the buildings. The hotel is fantastically located. The subway stations (there are 2 on the street one at the corner and the other about halfway down the street) are close, there is a Subway, Starbucks not far (if you take milk in your tea/coffee ask them not to fill it too high as they seem to fill them right to the top over there). There is also a dunkin donuts, tads brolied steak (my boyfriend loved this place) and a KFC. Times Square can be seen if you come out of the hotel, walk along to your right and then turn 90 degrees to your right. The room itself was relatively small but hey it was \u00a3100 a night and we were in central New York - you're not exactly there for the room! The bed was comfy, there was a TV and a small bathroom. The shower pressure was good and tolietries were provided. The room was cleaned each day and fresh towels provided. We were really very happy with the room. The room didn't have much of a view but we really didn't think this was important. The only gripe would be that the bathroom floor tended to flood from the water from the shower so we just put a towel down. Can walk to all the main attarctions very easily from here (which we did for the first 4 days) and then our feet were killing so we started taking the subway instead!

We got to the room, which was literally just a bed and a TV with a view of an alleyway (not recommended for the claustrophobic) After dropping off our bags, we went out. This hotel was located about 2-3 blocks from Rockefeller Center and across the street from the Gershwin Theatre and the Circle in the Square Theatre so in fact it was a really great location. After coming back a few hours later we realized our room was pretty hot even though we had turned on the AC full blast when we left. Called the front desk & they sent up a repairman who said the AC was broken and couldn't be fixed til morning, but opened the window for us. Gee thanks! So I went down to the front desk & had them change our room because I did not want to sleep in that sweat box all night.

My husband, who is a very occasional smoker went for smoking - i didnt think it would make much of a difference. I was very wrong! We entered our room to find there was literally a bed and a television. Our suitcases had to stand up against the wall and we had to squeeze passed them. There was no windows and the room stank of smoke. Being in the early stages of pregnancy i felt that there was no way that i could sleep in that room for 1 night, let alone 4. The en-suite was quite dirty and the toilet was blocked. We contacted reception regarding the toilet and also asked if we could change to a non-smoking room, mainly due to the smell. The room we were moved to was so much better! The room itself was about twice as big, there was room for our suitcases and there was 2 windows! The en-suite was clean and quite large. On the positive side, there was no problems with the house-keeping service, the other receptionists and hotel staff that we encountered were friendly. The hotel had a continental breakfast for $9.95, and there was plenty to choose from. The hotel itself is well situated - very central to the likes of Times Square and literally across the road from the Gershwin Theatre.

Both rooms were adequate for our needs. This time, I booked a room that was listed as a \"standard\" with either a full or a queen. We were given a full, but we wondered if it was a \"modified\" full! The room we were in (601) was probably less than three feet wide on one side of the bed and about six inches on the other side. It was too small for any furniture, which other reviewers mentioned--no chair, desk, table, night stand. There was a clock radio and phone propped on a three inch wide \"shelf\" attached to the side wall on the window side of the bed. The \"closet\" was on the other side of the bed, which was just a rod with a curtain hanging in front of it. The radiator (2 inches from the bed) was not adjustable and made noise all night. The air conditioner in the window had silver tape on it in an unsuccessful attempt to keep cold air from coming in. The very small bed was hard as a rock (you could feel the springs) and the carpet was dirty and run down. It is true that you spend so little time in the room that the size is not the most important thing and the location and price couldn't be beat.

The bathroom was also teeny tiny, with the toilet jammed into an alcove that your legs touched when sitting on it! No room for moving. The entire hotel, or what I saw of it, was incredibly dimly lit and the color scheme of dingy brown didn't really help the place to feel light and clean, but the linens seemed fresh and clean and the bed itself was really comfortable. We did have two windows in our room...one overlooked a huge heating unit ont he adjoined roof and the other was tiny and faced a brick wall. We never opened the blinds.

The desk staff were ok, although I did witness the desk clerk and the doorman involved in a loud, heated argument (including shouting and name calling) that went on for at least 15 minutes. I am surprised at such unprofessional behaviour when it was clear that there were many guests around. Overall, this place is entirely adequate for a short stay in NYC. Most people want location (this is it!) and cleanliness (pretty good) when In New York as you won't be in your room very much. It is definitely NOT the Ritz nor does it have the huge corporate glam of those skyscrapers down the street, but for the terrific deal I got on this place, I'd stay there every time.

We had no complaints. The hotel offers abuffet style breakfast which we only bothered with one morning - fruit, croissant, cereal and coffee, all very nice. As for dining, the hotel does not have its on restaurant but there is an oriental diner adjoined. We gave it a miss but only as it is not our thing. The hotel staff were all extremely helpful and friendlyin a number of languages. one girls (forget her name) even offered to take us to the bronx to yankee stadium as we were unsure about going on the subway!

We had 2 beds, and not much else in our room. It's hard to put into words how small the rooms actually are - especially for 2 people. Comfortable beds though. The staff was ok. Much nicer than most people have been writing about, but they seemed very uncaring for the most part.

This hotel was great. They let us check in early with no extra fee. The rooms were clean and the front desk service was spectacular. They went above and beyond to keep us happy. We asked for no maid service and they left us clean towels in a laundry bag hanging from our door anyway, so we didn't have to make a request. While I travel to Manhattan about once a month and know my way around very well, the bell hop was very helpful and always offered to give us directions or get us transportation. On our last day, they locked up our luggage after check out without charging us an additional fee (as many Manhattan hotels will), as we weren't leaving until the evening and check out was at noon. The room was a bit stuffy, but nothing that wasn't fixed by running the fan in the air conditioner for a bit. Water pressure (one of my big \"things\") was excellent.

(Fat chance, $9.95.00 for croissant and coffee! I recommend the Belly Delly for breakfast, it's truly wonderful!). After copying my number she handed it back and we made are way to the elevator that looked as though it dated back to the 1920's. It took ten minutes just to get to wait for the damn thing and get to our room which was on the second floor. When the elevator doors opened we were greeted by the smell of cigarette smoke. The room was simply disgusting, it smelled, there were damp patches all over the cieling, mould growing, cracked floors, cigarette burns, dirty bed linen and to my horror my son later found a Fungus growing behind a wonky radiator. We had to stay a night in this disgusting room but it felt like ten!!! Later on we discovered that they had deducted fifty dollars from my account without informing me. I canceled my card and i questioned them on this in which they replied that they took the money as an account for extra room services. I demanded to see the manager; however, this manager only works four hours a day... The Dragon, who we later named Cruella Devil finally agreed to move us after a lot of arguing. We were moved to the fourth floor. This room was better; however still dark, dingy and the same odd smell. The AC was loud and didn't cool the room; it seemed to blow out hot air. The bathroom was dirty and smelled. Also, the noise was terrible, people at night continually slamming doors, car horns and sirens something that we were guaranteed would not trouble us. The hotel was seedy, dark and simply disgusting with a strip club next door!

We had paid to upgrade to a King size bed but the room itself was very small and dark looking on to a concrete wall.

Alarm bells should have rang when I saw the mouse traps. We could not get a room anywhere else that night so had to go back to the hotel and swap rooms in order to get a couple of hours sleep. The room we were given to sleep in looked like a prison cell with a tiny double bed (looked more like a single) and I was relieved we had paid for the upgrade! This room also had mouse traps so the problem must be hotel wide rather than an isolated incident. Luckily Expedia moved us the next day and we went to Park Central Hotel which I would thoroughly recommend. Much more like a proper hotel. We lost a whole nights sleep and pretty much the next day of our holiday sorting this out, packing, moving and unpacking and were knackered! During such a short trip to loose this much time means a great deal. I work in the hotel industry and cannot believe that a hotel that knows it has a mouse problem will continue to take money and bookings for people to stay in rooms which are rodent infested.

The first night my boyfriend and I arrived (approx. 1AM), the front desk male said there was a problem with our room. Basically, they gave it away because they were overbooked. I was very annoyed at this point since I had called the night before to confirm that it would be a very late check-in and to ensure that our room would be ready. The front desk person then said they would pay for our cab fare and settle us into their sister hotel 4 blocks away on 54th St. (Ameritania Hotel), and that we'd be able to check back into the Amsterdam the next afternoon. When we checked into the other hotel, boy, were we in for a big surprise. I realize space is at a premium in NY, and rooms are tiny, but we opened the door, and the door hit the bed. The washroom had no tub, just a tiny shower that was a nasty grey colour, and we basically had to sit sideways to use the toilet to prevent our knees from touching the wall (I'm only 5'2\"!!). We sucked it up since it was for only one night, and the next day, we went back to the Amsterdam. The lady at the front desk was very nice and said that since we were put through some trouble the night before, the hotel would upgrade us to a king-sized bed. We were ecstatic and very appreciative that they were trying to redeem themselves. When we got to the room, it was still tiny, like most hotel rooms in NY, but it had a very comfortable bed and pillows, was clean for a hotel room, and the washroom was spacious with a tub/shower combo. The water pressure was decent, and the air con worked. It can be a little noisy at night or in the morning because the walls are pretty thin, and the hallway is very narrow, so you are in close proximity to your neighbours. There are very few channels on the small TV, but you're not in NY to watch TV anyways. All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel if you can get a cheap rate. It's a 3-star hotel supposedly, but maybe the standards are different in NY since most hotels there are pretty old. If you want a bigger room with more frills, you would have to pay way more and find at least a 4-5 star. Would suggest the SuperShuttle to/from the airport because it's only $17/person as opposed to $45+tolls+tips for cabfare. But only use the shuttle if you are not in a rush to get to/from the airport because it makes several stops at different hotels to pick other passengers up. It's a van, not a bus, so not too many passengers (up to 9, I believe). For Broadway show tickets, go to a TKTS booth and purchase them there. You can get tickets for 50% off for most shows. Recommend the play \"Avenue Q\" if you like fun, humour, and good music. For good, cheap bbq food, go to Dallas BBQ. Huge portions for what you pay for!!

Only 2 small drawers to put clothing into, so we just left everything in our luggage. I checked several websites for pictures prior to booking this hotel.

The renovations a few years ago were kind of slapdash in some ways with too much caulking around the sinks, etc. But to be fair, this is not a \"boutique\" hotel costing $350/night. It's a budget hotel in an old building. The lobby area has a lively bar and a nice little lounge with free coffee and tea and an internet terminal (charge applies). During my two visits (Sept. 2005 and March 2006) I have found the front desk staff to be professional and polite. Speaking of which, I traveled this time with a colleague who was given a ground-floor room. She heard a lot of noise from the lobby and from the smoking terrace behind the hotel, so I would avoid a ground-floor room. The furniture and bed linens look just like the photos on the hotel's website. The beds are very comfy and clean. I stayed once in a room facing 50th St. and once in the back of the hotel. I slept like a baby in the back room, though I got a lot of street noise in the front room (mostly drowned out by running the window a/c unit). The neighborhood is safe. There are delis and a subway stop just footsteps away, and you can walk to the heart of Times Square in about 2 minutes. I had a rental car for my business trip and paid $35/night to park across the street at a theatre's underground garage. Shocking? Yes, but that's the going rate for garage parking in midtown Manhattan. If you're traveling with kids, just be aware that there is an \"adult novelty\" shop on the same block. Frankly that is part of the history of the Times Square area, a holdover from the old seedy days before Disney came to the neighborhood. But the store is fairly low-key and you can't see much from the sidewalk. Overall this is a pleasant place to stay. I not only recommend it -- I was happy to return six months after my first stay.

The best thing about the hotel (other than its location) was its cleanliness - a major plus point. The room was a decent size, it did have a view of a brick wall, but we didn't care as we were out all day and being away from the street it also meant the room was quiet. The only notable negative was having to sit side saddle on the toilet due to its proximity to a wall, but I don't remember this spoiling my holiday!

As a New Yorker who was a bellman in the hotel industry when I was growing up, I can't believe some of the reviews I read on here. First of all, this is a two star budget hotel. If you want a great hotel experience in New York City, you have to pay top dollar. And when I say top dollar I mean at least $300 or $400 a night. And yes, the rooms are small. Do you realize you're in New York City where 22 million people live in the metro area? We don't have a lot of space here, so if you expect a big room with a lot of space, stay in New Jersey. And another thing, if you're going to buy from hotel scalpers (a.k.a. websites) understand that those cheap rates are cheap because there are risks involved. This particular hotel only has 16 rooms that have two beds in the room, so if you book through a website please understand that the bedding type is a request only, not a confirmed guarantee. That's one of the many reasons why its so cheap to book online, the risks. And those who complain about noise is just plain rediculous. You're in Times Square, NYC not at some far away in the country bed and breakfast. 22 million people kind of produce a lot of noise. Use common sense please. There is no greater insult than not tipping cabbies, bartenders, or bellmen. I tip bellmen the standard $1 per bag. So if you have like 8 suitcases and you give the bellman a $1 bill, that is a massive insult. When you tip the bellman at a hotel, he will be more inclined to point out secrets about NYC, discount cards to great restaraunts, and cheap transport back to the airport. These guys have connections, so if you don't tip them you could wind up missing out on some great experiences. I hope this has helped some of you who plan to stay at this hotel. I've stayed here 3 times now and I've had no major complaints.

It was nicely (and fairly recently) decorated, and was really clean. The bathroom was again quite small, but well set out and seemed to have been fairly newly updated. The shower was powerful and hot. Our room was cleaned to a really high standard and replenished with clean towels every day. Overall, we were really pleased with both our room and the hotel in general. There is some decorating work being done in some of the hallways, but this did not pose any problems at all. The main advantage of this hotel is the location - it is perfect if you want to be in the thick of things! Times Square and Broadway are just around the corner, but you can (and we did!) walk to lots of other attractions from here including ESB, Central Park, MOMA, Natural History Museum, Guggenheim etc. I will definitely be recommending this hotel to others visiting NY - its is affordable, pleasant and ideally located.

Upon arrival we were shown to our rooms (723 and 725) by the polite concierge. There was only a queen bed in each of the 2 rooms booked. We immediately returned to the reception desk to query this (as we had booked 2 rooms with single beds). The reception guy was extremely arrogant and unhelpful and said it was basically what you get when booking through a third party (last minute). I informed him that we had confirmed the rooms with the hotel direct before travelling, and he basically filled us with more bull. When I asked to use the phone to clarify this with the booking company, he would not allow me. We just could not win, and in the end fatigue won the day and so accepted the rooms with the promice that single bedded rooms would come free the following day (totally not true). The room was clean, and yes fresh towels were put in daily, but that was the only advantage. Our window looked directly onto a brick wall, (so much for the city views), only one bedside lamp worked, and the t.v had no suitable free view channels, and you have to pay approx $11.99 to view a movie. The walls are extremely thin and you can hear everything the people in the opposite rooms are saying. The bed was comfy but the quilt was as thin as ever (does 2 tog exist) considering it was -2 degrees outside. Fortunately our room was warm, unlike our friends. However the radiator was so close to the side of the bed you burnt your legs every time you got in and out. The bathroom was'nt much better. The shower thermostat was uncontrollable, either too cold or scalding hot, and most of the water ended up out of the tub. There was no coffee maker, and no room safe in either of the rooms as stated on their internet site. The coffee maker in the lobby was out of use and had been presumably since last year, and there was no complimentary breakfast as suggested. Flasks of hot water were provided but there was no fresh supply of milk. I suppose what made us feel a bit better was we weren't the only ones affected. In the 3 days spent at the hotel we witnessed the same complaints from 7 other holiday goers. My advise to anybody looking for a long weekend break is to look for a better hotel, this is the pits.

I noticed the very mixed reviews here so I thought my perspective might shed some light on things. When my husband and I check into our room at the Amsterdam Court we were disappointed. The room was small, dingy, and had a lot of street noise. When we sat down on and then tried to lie on the bed, we were were appalled. The mattress was lumpy and very, very caved in to the point where I truly didn't think we would be able to sleep on it without hurting our backs. I phoned the front desk to complain that the bed wasn't at all flat and the receptionist replied, \"Oh, they're all that way.\" After sputtering for a moment, I told her I doubted that they were all this bad and I stressed the point that the mattress was really caved and she then relented and said that she'd send someone up to show us other rooms. A very polite fellow arrived ten minutes later. He showed us a second room that was even dingier and tinier than the first. It was closet-like even by NYC standards. I supposed it was quieter, but that was the only thing going for it. By now, my normally easy-going husband was beside himself and said that the room was no good. The hotel employee then asked what we wanted and we told him that the bed in the first room was no good. He said, \"Oh, the bed!\" He then led us to a third room that had a nice big, flat, king bed. The room was also clean, and nicely (if cheaply) decorated, and quiet. It was the boutique-like setting we had been expecting! We stayed for three days and enjoyed our room and the fact that we were not paying a whole lot. We had no more problems for the rest of our stay. If I had only seen the last, good room I might have given the hotel a four stars, but since I saw the other two rooms I'm giving it two stars. Actually, it should be more like 1.5 stars because of the receptionist's initial response to my complaint. I have been afraid to go back to this hotel because I couldn't be sure we could get one of the really nice rooms again. Anyway, if you're on a tight budget, are going in the off season, and are ready to insist upon a room change, you might take your chances here. You MIGHT get lucky. Then again, you might not.

I need not have worried all was fine. I must say this is a budget hotel and I knew that when I booked it and you have to be realistic about it you get what youpay for and I got a really good deal. The whole trip including flight and hotel for four nights was 500GBP. I paid that 5 years ago and stayed in Loews in Lexington Ave. The rooms are tiny but spotlessly clean but you dont go to New York to stay in the hotel all day.The staff were very friendly and helpful and the candlelit bar was lovely. I do appreciate if you have paid a lot of money to stay here you would expect more but some of the negative comments written about this hotel are totally over the top. The real beauty of this hotel is the location - perfect.

In New York in general, the hotel prices are based on availability - we inadvertently chose marathon weekend, and struggled to find a room anywhere. Worth noting (having read a previous review) that the Waldorf-Astoria was $450 a night, so way more expensive. So, I would class the hotel as expensive, although no more than a similar hotel elsewhere in NYC would have cost that weekend. Wildlife: We awoke on our first night to hear a rustling noise in the corner of the room. Turning the light on, we discovered a small mouse running across our luggage. Not what one expects in a \u00a3165 a night hotel! We went straight to reception (at 3am) and were told there were no other rooms that night, but that we could switch in the morning. So, we were given a mouse trap and went back to bed. Closer inspection showed that the skirting board around the room had been plugged in several places with 'expanding foam filler' - so it was clear that they have tried in vain to cure an obvious mice problem. Comfort: The original room was quite small. It was clean etc, but the temperature was very high and the air conditioner broken. Room number two: The second room was great. Much larger, nice and cool, and no sign of mice. Much more like the room we would expect for the price. Had this been the first room we got, I'd have given a 4/5 rating. Breakfast: Breakfast was bagels and coffee (as much as you want). The bagels were nice, coffee was very nice and it was just right to set us up for the day - NYC has so many food experiences that we didn't want to fill up on breakfast in the hotel anyway. Staff: Without exception the staff were all friendly and helpful. The response to our issue with the mouse was exactly what you would want. Location: Just up from Radio City on West 50th between 7th and 8th Avenue. 20 seconds walk from 50th Street Metro station, which links you with all the major sights with ease. 5 mins walk to Time Square. 15 mins walk from Port Authority Bus Terminal. Excellent location all in all. Overall: A good hotel let down by the excessive price. That said, I am sure that other similar hotels in the area would be just as pricey.", "Date": "November 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Panama, Rep. of Panama", "Title": "\u201cA rip-off.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2809755", "Content": "I just stayed at the Amsterdam Court for three nights.

There was some inconsistency in the number of wash cloths provided, but in the grand scheme of things, not a big deal to me. The rooms were not huge, but neither are most hotel rooms in NYC...besides, that's not what I necessarily go there to enjoy. The lobby was in the process of renovation...and every day I noted marked improvement and progress. There was a neat little bar on the lower level, with great music and a cool atmosphere.
