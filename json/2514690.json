This, coupled with the garbage trucks and unbelievable lack of thought for any other guests by ignorant Americans shouting at the top of their voices at ungodly hours of the day (yes I include you, the 13 year old or so girl who just had to scream in her phone that she'd meet so and so downstairs in 5 minutes - at 7am) meant that it was difficult to get a good night's rest.

The very courteous AppleCore agent who took our telephone booking ensured that our requests were honoured: a king-size room in a quiet part of the 14th floor, with a full view of the Empire State. I'm a light sleeper so being high up, we heard no street from Korea Town/ 32nd Street. The morning we checked out, we were up at 4:30 am; we could hear the garbage trucks operating on the street below - but the noise didn't wake us prior to that. Most importantly, our room was very clean, especially the bedding. The mattress was protected with a solid, sterile mattress cover, and the area around and under the bed was spotlessly clean. The room is farily small, but there's enough room to walk around, work at the desk, have 2 suitcases open, and to hang come clothes in a small closet. The bathroom is small but manageable for one person at a time; it's also very clean. The hotel staff were always very friendly and helpful. The inclusive continental breakfast served daily from 6 am- 10 am is more than adequate: yogurts, apples, bananas, cereals, oatmeal, gently-boiled eggs, croissants and pastries in addition to bagels, toast, and the usual hot and cold beverages. What impressed us most was the fact that the breakfast room staff worked hard to keep the very busy breakfast room clean, tidy and continuously stocked up until 10 am. The lobby is very pleasant with 2 new Macs for guests to use. The Mezzanine lounge has comfy chairs, flat screen tvs and a 24/7 self service hot drinks 'bar'. The 2 newer elevators work well. Considering that the hotel was fully booked, the wait times for elevators, reception, breakfast were good. We also liked the fact that the hotel has designated parking out front for a couple of cars to drop off/pick up guests, and it's so close to the Subway! The only real frustration we experienced was that the WiFi reception was not good/non-existent in our 14th floor room. Reception tried several times to re-boot the server for our floor but it didn't work. Management later reassured us that they would look into improving this service. We'd stay at nmya again, and recommend it to friends.

I spent an age on my laptop trying to find a hotel as I had heard so many horror stories about pokey little places where you can't swing a cat. I happened upon this hotel and after looking at reviews etc booked it. It was a good choice. First plus was the view, I had contacted the hotel before arriving to say we were coming for my daughters 21st and could we have a room with a view of the Empire State Building. We were not disappointed as what a view, we were on the 13th floor with the empire state building outside our bedroom window. The room was also very nice, much more spacious than I expected in New York and the bed was very comfortable. You couldn't open the window, but then you can't in a lot of hotels and yes the air conditioning unit was a little noisy, but not unbearable. Knowing that New York is a 24 hours a day city, I had brought ear plugs and slept really well as did my daughter. The position is brilliant. Macy's around the corner (3 hours in shoe department with my daughter, but thats another story!) subway stations close by, 10 min walk to Times Square and as the hotel in in the middle of the Korean district, lots of lovely restaurants on the doorstep offering amazing food.

The breakfast area (bagels, coffee, juice etc.) is on the 2nd floor and gives you a good kickstart in the morning before you work day or sight seeing. The street the hotel is located on is called Little Korea and has many Korean restaurants and is quite safe. I have never had a problem walking around Manhatten even at night. The highlight of the stay had to be the Yankees game where the Yankees beat the Red Sox. Great day out and was my 5th Yankees game and my first at the new stadium.

The bathroom was very clean and water pressure was very good for showers, plenty of hot water. Housekeeping did an excellent job during my stay. One good thing, they did not start knocking on the door at 8AM rushing me out (that is a pet peeve of mine). The only two negatives I can think of are the continental breakfast, which was just toast and stale bagels, and the horribly slow elevators which take forever. There are tons of street vendors and other options available for breakfast so take advantage of those. The mezzanine area has juice and soft drinks available and is a pleasant place to take a quiet break after being out in the city. There is also a CVS pharmacy right across the street where you can purchase bottled water and snacks to keep in the room.

For more details about the street and location, see my May 14th 2011 review for La Quinta Manhattan. La Quinta and Nyma and three other hotels close by are all owned by the same company (Apple Core Hotels) and have similar offerings. We had a room with two doubles; it was a bit cramped for the four of us, but not tiny. I wanted two Queens but they didn't have any. It was very clean and the beds were comfortable. Also very quiet, probably because we didn't have a street-view room; no view at all. The air conditioning worked well and the hallway was positively arctic (which I liked in the middle of a summer). There was adequate hot water in the shower, although the shower curtain rod was loose and needed repair and the towels seemed a little skimpy and not very soft. Also, no grab bars in the bath/shower and no bathroom vent/fan. Large flatscreen TV with good picture and plenty of channels. No problem with the wifi for our laptops except the night when reception went out for the whole hotel, and even across the street at La Quinta. But I was surprised there was no in-room complimentary pens, paper, etc. and also no bed-side table with drawers - not very helpful. The in-room safe is big enough for lap-tops and locks and unlocks with your own credit card which is super-convenient. The complementary breakfast was well-stocked, although the layout is dumb with all the cups for drinks stuck back in the corner which causes a big and unnecessary bottleneck. Amarjit, (I think that's his name - an excellent breakfast staff-person!) did what he could to create a more rational set-up but on days he wasn't assigned to this room, it was back to difficult access and waiting to get a cup. The breakfast is identical to La Quinta's. It is very good I think - bagels and cream cheese, toast, donuts, pastries, hot and cold cereals, yogurt, hot hard boiled eggs, coffee, tea, real orange and apple juice, and apples and bananas. It can get crowded especially toward the end of the breakfast hours. There is an overflow room with a couple tables and lots of counter space. I found this room had more effective air-conditioning. We enjoyed our stay here very much, but even though the nightly rate was more expensive than at La Quinta we got only double beds, not queen-size beds like at La Quinta. Also, Nyma's two free huge-screen computers and the printer are right there in the front lobby. I felt very exposed using them. The lobby itself is not a warm or inviting place - lots of polished surfaces and functional seating - not great for meeting people. La Quinta has much nicer and more comfortable lobby seating, and a TV. Looking at the website after I came back, it seems that there is a mezzanine lounge which I totally didn't know about. Another Tripadvisor reviewer says there are hidden stairs to this level, which is above the front desk. If they have it, they should let people know with decent signage! So overall, I was happy with this hotel, but I have a preference for across the street at La Quinta. Nyma gave only a 5% AARP discount while La Quinta gave a generous 10% discount - which over a long stay makes a difference, and La Quinta's daily rates were a little better anyway. But for location and value, I can easily recommend this hotel too.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cOne time experience\u201d", "Author": "Red_Flashpacker", "ReviewID": "UR115901922", "Content": "To begin with the street outside is very dirty and has bad smell.

The room was clean, well appointed and a decent size for New York (probably as big as most normal people's bedrooms). No it's not the Four Seasons but it's a nice room and I had asked for a non-smoking room with a coffee maker, microwave and small fridge and got it. As soon as I got in I checked for bedbugs.

Breakfast was great with lots of options (fruit, cereal, toast, pastries, coffee, etc) but the coffee was really weak.

The clock radio does not charge an iPhone, but does an iPod, since the clock radio is an old version of the iHome clock radio. I had to pull out the night table to access the receptacle to charge my phone as I slept (and to use it as my wake-up alarm). They should have a more accessible receptacle beside the bed (or one in the base of the lamp as some do), but most hotels don't. The light at the desk is way to dim for doing any reading. The bathroom should have a fan. One has to keep the door open so it does not fill up with steam, which was okay because I was staying there alone, but might not be if you are sharing the room with someone. The gym/fitness centre is very poor as all they have is treadmills and elliptical trainers. But, you can easily get aerobic exercise by walking or running outside. They need a few sets of free weights and a couple benches as you can do every strength exercise known to man with free weights. I had to pay to go to a gym in NYC (not cheap!) to exercise which I shouldn't have had to.

It's not fancy, but the location is perfect for tourists - Empire State Building is right around the corner and Times Square is a quick subway ride away. Macy's is practically across the street and there are lots of inexpensive places to eat nearby. I stay in this general area every year and really like it. It can get too crowded at times, but I like being close to the subway, sights, shopping, etc. This hotel is on 32nd Street which is also known as Koreatown. There are numerous Korean restaurants, bars, grocery stores, etc and lots of young people at night. I have always felt very safe and comfortable in this area so I would also recommend it for women traveling alone. We had a non-smoking king with a small refrigerator and microwave. Room was very clean and comfortable and faced the street. There's quite a bit of noise at night and in the early morning due to the restaurants and bars lining the street, but I love the city and had no problem with it. My husband is a light sleeper and complained a bit, so keep this in mind when staying here. There is free wi-fi and it worked well. I was able to stream Netflix videos without any problems. If you need to check email or print anything, there is a computer in the lobby, but you have to pay to use it. You can print boarding passes for free, but that's it. The rate was unbelievably economical during Christmas - just $139 a night! We ended up staying through New Years and it went up to $259, but still very reasonable for NYC. Only small issue was the heating system. You can't control the temperature from your room and it can get pretty warm.

After I booked our room, I sent an email to NYMA explaining I was bringing my daughter to NYC for her 21st birthday and asked if we could possibly have a room with a view of the Empire State Building. I was told they would do what they could to provide such a room. We arrived at NYMA and were greeted by a very pleasant staff at the front desk. When we arrived to our room I was very impressed that the staff and management had gone above and beyond the call of duty to make our stay a comfortable one. I was in tears at their compassion and caring.We looked out the window and just as we had requested there stood the Empire State Building!

I went to reception and asked to be moved and gave my reasons why and the receptionist thought it was funny. The second room had a slightly better view but the room smelled even worse, this time of curry and very bad body odour, when I told reception this she said she would get housekeeping to sort it out. On returning to our room later that evening nothing had been done if anything, it smelled even worse. As time went on we realised it was the carpets that smell so badly. Then the hairdryer didn't work! Breakfast was a battle with the other guests as the breakfast room was no bigger than one of the bedrooms and there wasn't much selection either! The lifts were a nightmare, with 18 floors and 171 rooms that isn't good. Often only one lift was working and at a snails pace plus the cleaning staff use them which doesn't help. One of the days housekeeping didn't even bother to make our beds they only replaced the towels in the bathroom and most days we caught housekeeping watching the TV's in the rooms! The rooms are very cold during the night and the bedding is inadequate, you can't call a sheet and a throw on the beds \"bedding\". On our last day the car service arrived to take us to the hotel and the concierge tried to put the wrong baggage in the car and he didn't pick up everything out of reception so that when we got to Newark International we found one of the bags was missing which had my mother Christmas present, a photo of my granddaughter taken at Macy's with Father Christmas and my granddaughters hat, gloves and blanket. Of course when we phoned the hotel they didn't find the bag and claimed they spoke to the driver who said it wasn't it the boot of the car but how would he know when he was still driving.

The receptionist, a friendly-sounding young woman, said that the hotel had plenty of room that night and that although she was leaving soon, it would be no problem to wait a bit, I could call back or my friend could even just walk in. I called back not fifteen minutes later, wanting to finalize the booking. A man had come on shift. He seemed to know about my earlier call, although I might have misunderstood him. He quoted me $155+tax for the same room, same configuration. I protested that I had been quoted $139 on the previous call, honest and fair square. He said \u201cYes, she can tell you anything she wants but that was then and now I am in charge here.\u201d I said I wasn't very happy. Then he offered me $147+tax. I said no and called the La Quinta across the street and got a room for $139+tax.

It was a friendly negotiation and they did move, so I can't really complain too loudly.

The icemaker on our floor was a bit noisy but we were so tired from having come in on the red eye that it didn't bother us. Breakfast was simple but adequate although a bit cramped and chaotic.

We upgraded at the last minute from \"superior\" to \"deluxe\" to get a bigger room which included microwave and fridge. We found the room to be spacious by NYC standards. We fit a cot in the room when we needed it and it still did not feel cramped to us. We've stayed at up-scale hotels elsewhere but this fit our budget for NYC. There were some minor things I would have changed, but overall, we were extremely satisfied and would recommend highly to other travelers. The location, really, could not be better!!! Located in Korea Town (1 block stretch of W32nd St.) with welcoming lights strung above the street. Proximity to subways (all lines are 1-2 blocks away), Herald Square for shopping, Empire State Building, and walking distance to Times Square (we walked there every night for the fun of it and to see a show). The entire area felt safe at all hours for my daughter and me. \"Korea Way\" is filled with restaurants and eateries so on garbage pick-up nights, the piles of bags of garbage on the sidewalks can seem intimidating. We were prepared for this based on the reviews in tripadvisor so it did not bother us at all. Details of the room (the good and the bad): Room was very clean; bathroom was modern and spotless (no mildew or off-odors). Furniture and decor of room were not special but they were fine. We had plenty of room to walk around bed, etc. We were surprised how nice it was - simple but nice! Bed was very comfortable (memory foam?) and we slept well every night. Sheets, blanket and bedspread were thin but adequate. The 5 pillows in the room were all a bit strange (not down or fluffy poly - more granular!), but we didn't notice when we went to sleep. Excellent room soundproofing. We were on the side of the building so the view was not great. A/C worked but adjustment was weird - maybe just our room. We needed to call the front desk to have A/C adjusted up or down; there was no working thermostat control in the room. We were in NY in summer with 90 degree days so a/c was essential. Short on amenities - no little bottle of hair conditioner.:-) Hotel did not have any, but CVS was right across the street. Instead of real glasses, a stack of individually wrapped plastic cups was provided in the bathroom. We bought bottled water so we didn't have to drink chlorinated tap water. Deluxe room has fridge and microwave which came in handy with restaurant leftovers! 32\" flat-screen great for occasional tv viewing. Two cordless telephones were more than enough. Desk, bureau, and closet were spacious. The two nightstands had fake drawer fronts (real drawers would have been handy). Plenty of lights in the room to control. Loved the adjustable reading lamps -- a very nice unexpected touch. Iron and board were supplied in the closet. Rolling desk chair and upholstered arm chair completed the furniture in room. Door to bathroom is patterned etched glass so lacked privacy! Lobby is very plain but neat and clean. Elevators were slow and small, but not a problem for us. We used the fire exit stairs if we were in a hurry -- good option if you don't mind passing some bagged trash at the ground level (fire exits do not lead to lobby but go to sidewalk directly). Might be a little gross but if you're in a hurry.... Free, ample continental breakfast was available but we preferred alternatives outside. Business center - I needed to use it to access internet one evening. Computer is located in balcony off lobby; $3 minimum buys 15 minutes. No problems encountered. I was never able to access the free hotel wifi on my iPhone but used 3G network instead. Maybe if I had a laptop, the wifi would have been fine. The doorman was fabulous, helpful, and very friendly! Outside the hotel: We went to the Empire State Building after midnight on the first night we arrived --because we could and it was just around the corner -- the view was spectacular; NO LINES and we felt we had the place to ourselves. The staff was super friendly because there weren't crowds to manage. Cheap postcards and souvenirs - 40 postcards for $1; I Love NY t-shirts ($1 kid size, 3 for $10 adult), just to the right at the corner at 5th Ave. Food - Korean BBQ - we really enjoyed bibimbap at Miss Korea next door to the hotel (excellent food, friendly service, reasonable prices). Don't miss the \"frogurt\" dessert across the street at Pink Berry - delicious fruit flavored frozen yogurt with fresh fruit toppings! The lines were long but the treat was worth it! In Times Square, check out the delicious choices at the gelato cart in front of Sbarro restaurant (we had refreshing coconut gelato). Do not miss Chinatown Ice Cream Factory - gentle, exotic flavors your mouth will thank you for - try lychee, red bean, \"dan tat\" (custard - yummy!). All in all, an amazing trip to NYC that we will never forget. Because of NYMA's excellent location, we could go anywhere very conveniently -- especially the nightly walks to Times Square!", "Date": "July 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cIt's just a hotel in Manhattan\u201d", "Author": "shieri55", "ReviewID": "UR72794054", "Content": "It used to be Red Roof Inn and we got this reservation through Red Roof Inn's website.

There must have been a shortage of facecloths in the hotel, as we had to call down for some each day after the room was made up, but these came up promptly. A small fridge would have been nice in the room to hold a few beers or restaurant leftovers. The location on 32nd St near 5th Ave was excellent. Exactly 2 blocks south of the Empire State building, we could look up and see its summit from our bedroom window. The subway at Herald Square was a block west and for shoppers, Macy's New York, JC Penney and the garment district are right there. We purchased a 7-day MetroCard ($27)for unlimited access to NY subways and buses and often used the Park Ave and 5th Ave buses to get uptown to the museums and galleries.

Breakfast of cereals, breads, fruit was included but the breakfast room was small, noisy and frenetic.

Read great reviews here, and for the price (@ 159 a night), I couldn't find a better deal. Things to note: Location: - Located walking distance from Empire State Building, Madison Square Gardens, Penn Station (you can walk from your hotel to the station and visa versa if you take the subway from the aiport. Very economical!!) Also a subway station (34th Hearld Square) a block away that will link you to the rest of the city if you're tired from walking. - Located in Korea Town. This was a con for me. If you are sensitive to smells, you may want to reconsider this location. Although NO smell from the street whatsoever enters the hotel - restaurants from the street lay out their garbage each morning on the sidewalks and let it sit in the 100 degree heat all day until collection at night. Walking to a from the hotel was quite smelly and dirty. This is the only drawback to location. Rooms - We had a king size bed. We wanted a double room, but they were all sold out. All the could do was give us a king bed and charge us an extra 20 dollars a night for a cot. The king size ended up being large enough for two people to spread out and not even touch, so it worked out in the end. - NO BED BUGS. Thankfully, as other hotels in the area were being closed at the time for infestations. Very clean. Hotel staff did a great job cleaning and restocking the rooms - although you have to make it very clear if you want bottles or garbage removed. If we left them on night stands they were left, but when we put them together next to the TV, they were removed. - Air conditioning worked perfectly. I didn't find it too loud at all. Actually, it quite nicely drowned out the sounds of honking and sirens from the street below and slamming doors from other guests in the morning. These are the only sounds I managed to hear, but I had a great sleep, and I am a very light sleeper, so this is saying a lot :) Breakfast: - Very basic, but to be expected from a continental breakfast. Toast, bagels, oatmeal, yogourt, apples and bananas, coffee and juice. Never changed, same every day, but much needed sustinence for travelling and did the job. Available from 7 - 10 am. Closes exactly at 10 am, so make sure you get there at least bt 9:55 because they will lock the doors, but not kick you out of the dining area. Service: - Hit or miss. One lady was very helpful, and another gentlemen not helpful at all. For example, one night we needed a corkscrew for a bottle of wine. The gentleman at the front desk just looked at us blankly, then shook his head no. We thought, considering they have a bar (closed temporarily), they would have one. The next day we asked the lady, and she said abosolutely, we'll send one right up and you can keep it for the rest of your stay. It appeared at our door within minutes. Later, when we needed forks and knifes, the same gentleman denied us again. When we made a bit of a polite fuss, and ended up having a whole set nearby, which he thend lended to us. Overall though, the staff were helpful. WIFI - Just a note - wifi DOES NOT WORK anywhere in this hotel. At least on my smartphone. I could connect, but the signal was poor or fair in our room (which I requested to be wifi accessible). Even when I tried in the lobby, my phone could not connect. There is a paid internet computer in the bar which accepted my money, but would not connect. Luckily though, the concierge refunded my money and told us to go across the road to the business centre at La Quinta Inn (also owned by red roof) and use the free internet there. This worked, but was quite a hassle to go back and forth across the road to use the internet. Also points of interest: - Elevator is incredibly slow - if you're not too high up or don't mind the exercise, use the stairs. - Subway is incredibly confusing (and I'm from a big city myself) - grab a map from the concierge before using, or you may end up horribly lost as we did. Overall the hotel was a perfect place in terms of location, price, and quality for 2 young girls on a budget.

Excellent location if you're coming in on Train- 2.5 blocks from Penn Station. Close to 5th ave.Interesting Korean neighborhood-I mean that in a good way! WE felt safe and Korean BBQ's resturants are great. Empire building is right around the corner.And if you want double -decker tour bus, a stop is there too. We did that and it was fun. Some Fast food places too. Cabs are numerous here (unlike Chinatown where we had to wait 40 minutes for a empty one at a busy intersection in the afternoon?) We cabbbed to broadway play, took cab back to hotel - got the kids and caught cab back to Times Square at 10:30pm and shopped. I was amazed at how NYC'ers love their city. TIP:NYC gift shops by hotel, on 32nd and 5th are cheap. Who ever heard of 40 postcards for $1? ALSO, STATUE of Liberty-GET RESERVE tickets for boat, lines are long. I saw \"timed\" internet printed tickets flying ahead of me in line...and plan on 5+hrs for Ells island and Statue. We would defintely go again to NYC and stay here.

($250 per night was the going rate). The location of the hotel was superb for us. On 33rd Street and 5th Ave, it is literally one block from the Empire State building and a longer block away from Herald Square and Macey's. The subway station at Herald Square is a big one with many lines. The hotel's location on 33rd Street is on a block known as Little Korea, for the multitude of big, small and medium sized Korean restaurants, many open 24 hours. The constant foot traffic gives this block a very safe feeling. We ate at one of the restaurants and enjoyed the Korean BBQ a lot. Our room was small, as is standard in most NYC hotels, but not even close to feeling claustrophobic, just, well... small. Our view included the Empire State Bldg which was lit up in Blue and White lights, for Chanukkah, I guess. The bed was comfortable and the simple bathroom was in good condition and spotlessly clean. The staff was very nice. There is a free complementary breakfast, but during the weekend it is mobbed and we chose to eat outside the hotel. There are too many eating opportunities and not enough time to waste on a skimpy free hotel continental-style breakfast. We're talking Barney Greengrass (see my review) and NY diners for the epitome of NYC breakfasts. Due to a snow storm over Sat night, we thought it might be prudent to extend our stay until Monday. I asked the front desk for a discount for the night and they graciously gave me one. For great location, super clean facilities, friendly service this hotel could have have gotten 5 stars from me, it lost one star for the poor heating control that either when on cooked you, or when turned off became freezing.

I thought the location was fabulous. It was only a few minutes walk from Penn Station, so it was very quick and easy to get to the hotel after I arrived in the city. A number of subway lines are located within a few blocks of the hotel, which was convenient, although we were so centrally located that we preferred to walk most places. Basically next door to Herald Square, which contains Macy's and other shops. A Pinkberry frozen yogurt stand is also across the street from the hotel, although we did not eat there. Room was very nice -- I could tell it was recently renovated. Bed was very comfortable, and I liked the flat screen TV. We were a bit put off that the bathroom door was made of frosted glass; if you are traveling with someone you do not know very well, this could be a bit awkward. Room was of a comfortable, although not overly large, size. We went down to breakfast only one of the two mornings we were there and were relatively unimpressed. We went later in the morning, so perhaps the options are more extensive if you arrive early. There were bagels and other pastries, instant oatmeal, juice, coffee, and yogurt -- but what I really wanted was a piece of fruit, which was nowhere to be found. Breakfast room was also very crowded, so I noticed several people taking their food/coffee back to their rooms to escape the insanity. However, given that it is free, the breakfast didn't bother me too badly, and my friend was perfectly happy with her yogurt and bagel with cream cheese. As others have mentioned, waits for elevators can sometimes be a bit long, but they were not nearly so bad as I feared. Worst was in the morning when everyone was going to/from breakfast and leaving the hotel for the day, and even then I'd say the longest I waited was perhaps 5 minutes. Front desk staff was courteous, if not overly effusive. I noticed that there was parking available for $25 a day, which is not bad for NYC; other hotels I have stayed at have charged upwards of $50 a day. The only thing that really bothered me is that the doors of the rooms are not thick at ALL. This was not a problem for 90% of the time that we were there -- the floors are small, so there is generally not a lot of foot traffic in front of your door. However, as we tried to go to sleep one night, some men where shouting in the hall (it sounded like two of them were ready to go and were trying to encourage their friend to hurry up) -- it sounded like they were in our room.

It's SLIGHTLY frosted but leaves nothing to the imagination, you can totally see in the bathroom when someone is in there. What the heck were the designers thinking?? Duh. We had a reservation problem. The day before we left for the trip we called the 1-800 number and changed our reservation to be an extra day longer, and got a new confirmation sent to our email, and thought all was well. But, the hotel never got this updated info and thought we were still checking out on sunday and not monday which is what we changed to. So we were out all day sunday and we get back to the hotel and this guy is at the door, and sternly asks if we were from room 1106, and we need to see the desk IMMEDIATELY. So, there I am already late for dinner reservations having to convince this woman that we are indeed reserved till monday. I had to send my wife up to the room, to get out printed off confirmation of this, before she would let me go. They were almost treating us like we were trying to dash after staying for free or something. In the end we got it worked out, but it wasted 30 minutes of our day and made us late for dinner and we weren't really please at the way we were treated. We got a quick apology and I was told that It's my responsibilty to make sure the info is correct when I check in, and blah blah blah. When I just assumed it was all right according to my reservation and I signed. So, the moral to this story is ALWAYS TAKE A PRINTED OFF CONFIRMATION to any hotel you are staying in. Don't trust that their computers have all the info that was GUARANTEED to you. Other than that. The hotel was awesome. Everything was great. Location rocked! In the middle of everything. It was quiet, didn't have any problems.

I am a young guy from the UK but felt compelled to write this due to my experience here. I am currently writing this from my room in the hotel and have only 2 (minor) complaints since I arrived which I will get to. First the positives: 1) I am out here on an extremely tight budget and have to say that what you get here, for the price you pay, is EXCEPTIONAL value for money. Especially for NY. I have booked in for 7 nights 5 of which I'm paying $109 + tax (about \u00a360) and 2 at $119 + tax. I flew in to NY from LA and spent MANY hours whilst in LA checking out room prices in Manhattan and this price, compared to what you get at this hotel, is exceptional I believe. - plasma tv in room, free wi-fi in room, complimentary continental breakfast (which I havent mnaged to wake up in time for yet-although it ends at 10.00am) and clean amd modern furnishings and comfy clean bed. put it this way, before here I was in the Chelsea International Hostel which for $80 a night for a private room (only about $40 - \u00a325 less per night) was absolutely gross. tiny box of a room which had nothing but an old rusty bunk bed and a small sink, no tv, no nothing - horrible smelly shared shower, wifi in a downstairs shared kitchen that rarely worked. So arriving here was a HUGE relief. 2) The location is great I think. 32nd street is right in the hub of things if like me you are a tourist. close to the 40's and 50's and central park one way and close to soho and greenwhich the other way, so the tube journeys are never that long and cab rides are cheap. admittedly yes it is in the middle of Korea town and you are surrounded by Koreans outside the foyer and korean restaurants, but so what. Koreans are hardly threatening are they. It can be a tiny little bit noisy, even up here on the 11th floor, but where in such a good location isnt. My only 2 minor negatives 1) the air conditioning in my room doesnt appear that strong, I had it on 'High' and it didnt seem to make the room all that much cooler, although to be fair I only had it on for about 1 hour before realising that I didnt really need it. 2) the lifts take blooming ages, as someone said before, especially if like me you up on the 11th floor, These minor inconveniences seem a very small price to pay for all the positives, especially the value for money! I may even book in for another week.", "Date": "June 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portsmouth", "Title": "\u201cNice, clean & comfortable and fantastic location\u201d", "Author": "Cantthinkofaname_9", "ReviewID": "UR31699739", "Content": "Stayed here after reviewing this web site and not disappointed.

Bath room was clean and with a good shower. Did not notice any noise from outside and slept well in comfortable beds. Breakfast - not up to much but it's in the price (if you wanted something substantial, just around the corner opposite the Empire State Building was a great Italian diner). Location \u2013 the hotel was a bout a 10min walk from Penn Street station (exit from the Madison Square Garden exit). It is also literally just around the corner from the Empire State Building. Also, don\u2019t be put off by the fact it is in a street that is called \u2018Korean Way\u2019 \u2013 the Korean sector of New York.

I asked for a non smoking room on an upper floor away from the street, and they delivered.

Flat screen LCD TV, Microwave, college frig, FREE wifi. Overall the room was clean and bright. I had a problem with the safe, after a call to the front desk- maintenance appeared within 15 mins.

We booked a 'red hot deal' on the hotel's website, which offered a king room for $148 + taxes per night. We stayed for 7 nights. This was our first trip to New York. Things didn't start out too well. After arriving from San Francisco at Penn Station the hotel was an easy 5 min walk. The area felt safe even though it was around 1.00am. However, when we arrived at reception the man on the desk informed me that he only had a second floor room available. I had booked a king room, non-smoking and I had requested a high floor, away from the elevator! We were so tired and decided to go straight to the room and try to get some sleep. The room was away from the elevator BUT it was right next to the ice machine and it stank of stale smoke (a smoking room). I spent the night tossing and turning listening to the clunking of the ice machine and smelling the smoky air! Plus, as it was located on the second floor it was also right beside the breakfast room which was noisy from 6.30 onwards. I thought I was being taken for a fool. Needless to say, we had an early breakfast and then went to look at the higher floors and the location of the other rooms, before going straight to reception to request a different room. This receptionist ( a lady) was very efficient and after I explained what we needed she moved us to the 12th floor (no-smoking floor) away from the ice machine and far enough from the elevators. It was also a corner room which meant we only had neigbours on one side. Although the room faced the street I was able to sleep well. Speaking of sleeping the bed was very comfortable - it had a 'pillow-top mattress' - and it was hard to leave it in the mornings! There were plenty of pillows and clean towels. Everything was very clean and maid service was efficient, always respecting the 'do not disturb' sign. Plus, another bonus, our room faced the Empire State building and we could look up each night to see the illuminated top. It was very quiet within the floor at night - we never once heard any noise from the next room. From our point of view the hotel was very well located for our first visit. As others have already said, the ESB and Macys were very close. Times Square was just one stop away on the subway - subway stations also close by. The concierge provides a good map showing streets and subway lines and a more detailed bus or subway map can be got free from any news kiosk. The hotel is located in 'koreatown' hence the many korean restaurants and take aways. We did sample some food from the 'Woorijip' a couple of doors up from the hotel and this was cheap and tasty. Although there seemed to be a lot of bagged rubbish piled up on the sidewalks at night, I think this may be the case everywhere and it was always cleared by morning. Breakfast was welcome and set us up well for the day. It's self service from 7 - 10. Probably better to be there by 8.00 as it does get crowded later. We didn't use any other services as we were out most of the time, only coming back at night to sleep. There is also a PC in the lobby with 'pay as you go' internet access, which is useful if, like us, you don't travel with a laptop.

Each floor only has 12-16 rooms that are pretty spaced out so I never heard the other people coming home. We were on the 16 floor and the street noise was at a minimum. LOCATION--We were within easy walking distance to Madison Square Garden. It was less than 1/2 a mile and could be walked in about 10 minutes. We were also within two blocks of the four major subway lines. So if you couldn't walk to the location you needed it was easy to hop on the subway.

There also was a coffee machine, but the coffee left a lot to be desired, I preferred to get one in the cafe further down 32nd and bring it back. The breakfast was fine, usual stuff - bagels, toast, cereal etc.. I hated the polystyrene cups and plates, I suppose its a good way to cut down on staff but it means a lot more garbage! The only thing that I didn't like was the bar, we went there twice and had only one drink both times, I didn't think the bar man was particularly friendly, in fact he was a little bit rude and also the music was so loud it was hard to have a conversation. I preferred the bars around the corner on 33rd street.

I am not sure if it is just that the price goes down in the winter or if it is the bad economy driving the prices down, but either way I was pleased. The hotel, as said before, is clean and modern and the king room we had was great for the two of us. Bathroom was also clean and a good size for 2. The heat was a bit wonky and it took a while to heat up, but once it did is was very comfortable and we actually had to turn it down because it got too hot. We were also happy to find that the elevators were much faster than our last stay. Don't know if we just lucked out, but we never waited for more than a minute for them. The staff is not the most smiley bunch, but when we arrived before check in time, the desk clerk went out of his way to get us our room right away.

The only downfall was that the only room w/ 2 beds left was a smoking room, but the smoke was manageable (even though the front desk clerk said it wouldn't be bad 'cause no one smokes - so not the case here!) Then again, I'm used to staying in Vegas rooms all the time. It was worth paying the $300/night to have a nice and clean room. Beds were comfy and bathroom was completely stocked w/ towels and toiletries. Flat screen TV was a nice addition. The hotel is situated on a block we dubbed \"Koreatown\" since it is nothing but Korean restaurants and businesses. But this added to the flair of our block, as there were always people hanging out at different times of the day and night. I never felt unsafe coming back to our hotel late at night because there were always people around. In other words, the area never seemed \"shady\" to me, even at night. The staff was nice and the one time we needed assistance with the TV, there was someone at our door in less than 5 minutes. They have an activity desk and when we inquired about the Statue of Liberty, she told us to go online. So that was a disappointment! Overall, this was a great central location to have brand new accommodations (since I've read so many horror stories about horrible hotel rooms on this site!) and be surrounded by so many options.

We only watched the news in the mornings. 6) Lots of towels and bathroom accessories. We never had to ask for anything. 7) Good air conditioning system. 8) Good Chamber Maid Service. 9) Hotel room was quiet. 10) Helpful concierge and doormen. CONS 1) Small rooms and bathrooms -although this is very common in Manhattan. 2) On the pricey side for what the hotel is - again this is very common in Manhattan, so this is to be expected. 2) Indifferent Front Desk Staff. They could use a little training in customer service. 3) The hotel is located on West 32nd Street between 5th and 6th Avenue, also known as \"Korean Way\". There were piles of garbage outside of the many Korean Restaurants along this street each evening. Not a problem, if you can overlook the smell of garbage in the evenings.

The hotel itself is ok - it is located in Korea Town with lots of restaurants and close to many attractions. We had a twin room booked, size of the rooms were ok for New York. There is no fridge, had a plasma tv but also bad reception for tv channels (probably to get you to pay for movies). Bathroom is small but adequately clean. What I could not understand however, is the attitude of the staff here. There was not a single front desk staff who was helpful or courteous in the entire time we stayed. We rang a few times to ask a question and we were grunted at! One night we came back to our room to realise we had both left our access cards in the room. When I went to ask them for another one, I was told I had to have photo ID. When I said I had them in the room, I was told by the man that 'there is nothing I can do then'. He then turned to serve someone else! We are not fussy people and were not expecting first class service...but we were expecting staff who were polite and helpful. Obviously the customer service training program the manager was referring to in response to another reviewers experience is not doing its job. Breakfast was ok - had cereals fruit, pastries, juice, coffee, bread and bagels. Eating area pretty small and often no space to sit down to eat between 8am-9am. There are TWO lifts to service 17 floors and on the last two days at least one of the lifts were not working which meant people had to wait at least 15mins for a lift or as we did walk up and down 10 flights of stairs! The wireless Internet is free but very patchy (drops in and out all the time). There is a computer in the bar area which you have to pay to use and where you can print from. We thought that was great....until we tried to use it. We spent all of the time we paid for trying to install Adobe Acrobat Reader so we could actually open the attachment in our email that we wanted to print. The girl at the bar gave us some extra credit, but then the internet stopped working! Apparently it happens all the time....yet they don't fix it...

The 32 inch TV on the wall was really welcome. We were placed on the back of the hotel and the view was not unpleasant.

My extented family and I stayed there before departing and after returning from a cruise. Our first night was fine, and in fact we were quite pleased with the hotel. It is close to the Empire State Building, and the train, and we eager to return and spend time sight seeing in New York with the hotel as a centrally located base. However, when we tried to check back in there were a lot of problems. We were informed that even though we had a confirmation number and had booked in December of 2007, we were only booked in for three nights instead of four. Further we were informed that the rate for the additional night would be $385, $177 more than we had originally been quoted. When we questioned this rate, we were told that was the price and there was no negotiation. We pointed out that we had a confirmation number and that the number of nigts and the ratest had been booked in December, but were told that computer said we were staying for thee nights not four and so even though we a confirmation number given when we booked there was nothing to be done. When we asked why the rate was such a drastic increase from what we had been quoted, $208, we were told that that rate was wrong and in fact if we wished to stay our rate was $275 per night for the first three nights and then $385 for the fourth. We said that this was not what we had confirmed, but we were told, again, that that was what the computer said. We then attempted to cancel our three rooms, but were informed that Red Roof Inn policy states that all cancellations must be made 24 hours previously and that as we had stayed there before we were familiar with the policy so even if we decided to leave the hotel and find other accomodations we would be charged for our rooms. We pointed out that we were in the middle of the Atlantic ocean the day before and that we didn't at that point in time know there was a problem that would require us to change hotels and we were again told that Red Roof Inn policy requires a 24 hour cancellation and we would be charged for the rooms whether or not we used them. We very reluctantly stayed the night, and left the following morning, after paying over $60 dollars a room more than we had been quoted and had confirmed. We filed a complaint with Red Roof Inn corporation and when after hearing nothing for a week we placed a follow up call, we were informed that it was most likely we would never hear anything back as this location was know to be unwilling to \"give refunds,\" or to negotiate in any way. We booked three rooms on two separate nights and were prepared to book one room for another four nights, and we recieved no help. Our rates were changed by at least 60 dollars in each room, and this was after we had confirmed and booked in advance. After confirming twice on the phone, our reservation was filed incorrectly. And we were not given any help or cooperation from the front desk staff, or the corporate staff when we spoke to them. We didn't want any special treatment or rates, but simply what we had booked and confirmed four moths previously. This hotel has a great location, the rooms were clean and modern and the housekeeping and bell staff were friendly but based on the poor level of customer service at the front desk and the total lack of corporate response, I will never recommend it, or another Red Roof Inn property to anyone.", "Date": "May 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queensland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "Loudles", "ReviewID": "UR16185765", "Content": "We had 4 nights in NYC.

As yes, the location is fabulous, much better than some noisy streets near Times Square. The hotel is right in the corner of 5th avenue (and also few steps away from Broadway) and is right beside the Empire State Building and 34th street shopping (which, believe me, is much more affordable than in 5th avenue). Took about 15-20 minutes to walk to Times Square. The west 32nd street is quiet (=quiet rooms) but very safe, never felt unsafe anyware near the hotel (and safety is no. 1 in my book). Rooms are nice and clean, with nice big tv. Beds are funny: first I though that that the mattress is hard, but boy did it turn out to be comfortable - it kind of adjusted to your body, so very good beds. The pillows were excellent too, none of those large hard ones which make you think you have a large rock under your head. Breakfast room is small, but was not full if you went prior to 8 am. But can't say what it will be like in the rush season but you can always take food up to your room. Only negatives I have are the elevators (they are a bit old and slow, but hey, you are on vacation and have no hurry) and the service (which is mediocar at best).

Three tips: for best views, go to Top of the Rock at Rockefeller Plaza (better than ESB); for best skyscraper outline and truly unforgettable experience - walk across Brooklyn Bridge and turn back when all the lights start coming on, for the overall views take the Circle Line (semicircle tour will be enough to see the Statue of Liberty, Staten Island etc.).

We arrived at Port Authority and took the Metro to Penn Station, once at Penn we were able to walk to the Inn, it's that close! Checking in was effortless and in fact it was even cheaper than what was quoted to me over the phone (use AAA if you have membership). The gentleman at the front desk was very pleasant. Our room was not large but it was clean and newly renovated. I was worried about air quality and bathroom cleanliness. We stayed on a non-smoking floor and there was not a hint of cigarette smoke. The bathroom was spotless. The only downside was the veeery sloooow elevators. Lots of construction work going on and there are only two elevators. One is used for patrons and the other is for construction. We used the stairwell once so that is an option. It was really nice to leave the hustle and bustle of Times Square by settling down in a quiet room, we did not have a view,not an issue with us.

Our 20th Wedding Anniversary and 1st visit to the USA. I e-mailed explaining both and asking for a quiet room with a good view. The reply from the Hotel was our request would be passed to the GM. We arrived at the hotel after our long flights (as we travelled via Amsterdam) to be met by a severe receptionist. (no hint of a welcome smile) ok she may have been having a bad day but was that our fault! We were given our key and told our room was on the 12th floor. Yes, we waited ages for the lift, when it arrived the other one opened at the same time and we were met by a builder and a full skip. Passing the 8th floor drilling- hoped that was not going to continue. Opened our room door to see the tiniest, dingiest room but it was clean and if we had planned to spend much time in it (which we did not) then we certainly weren't now. It looked over the side Room 1210. Was too tired to bother mentioning it to receptionist( her attitude didn't exactly lend itself to her giving a damn anyway) On the plus side it was quiet and the maids were really cheerful & happy people. The breakfast was really good too. Beware though if you have a problem the manager we spoke to should visit a charm school. My husband accidently lost our safe deposit box key at the Yankees Game or somewhere on the day we went to the game. We held our hands up and were told that he would have to pay$125. Ok but we had to see the General manager the next day at 12.30. So we stayed in our room till then as OUR money was in the box- went down to meet the manager, fobbed off with he was busy and had we really looked properly! Manager would see my husband at 1pm, back to room back down in lift at 1pm waited , waited and waited manager not available. Come back at 2pm. Finally turned out that the reception person told us they had a spare key (not true). Manager had to arrange for someone to break open our box- bearing in mind the hotel was full of workmen why did we have to wait so long? We were only in New York for 5 days. Spent half our penultimate day waiting for the Manager. We have both been employed in hotels within the UK and if we treated our visitors like this we would not be employed.

Check in staff were curteous (not over friendly) and swift. We requested a non-smoking room with a view of the Empire State Building - we got our view but it was in a smoking room on the 6th floor. The smell was unbearable and after one night we requested a room change. This was done with no complications or hassle and we were moved to a room on the 14th floor which was at the back of the hotel so there was no street noise which was great. The free breakfast in the hotel was brilliant - loads of choice and we ate there everyday. The location was second to none and just around the corner from Macy's!! The interior of the hotel is a bit dated but they are doing the hotel up floor by floor at the moment beginning at the top and working their way down. Check out was a little delayed as a big group was checking out at the same time as us (the hotel is very popular for large groups of Amercian school/college students). The only problem I had with the hotel was that they booked us a car to JFK airport through a car company which they use (not a yellow cab) and they told us it would cost $55 dollars and we paid a $10 deposit to the hotel which left the fare at $45. When we arrived at the airport the driver attempted to charge us $60 but we did not pay him. He then demanded $55, we were in a rush so we gave it to him but in charging us $55 he lost out on his tip. I emailed the hotel to complain about this 1 week ago but so far have not had a response.

My reservation got screwed up multiple times. While I was in transit to New York, someone from the hotel called me to say that there were no rooms available for me. I was sharing a room with two other people, who had already checked in when I arrived (I guess our room was available after all...). However, when I got to the hotel, they could not find the names of my companions in their computer system and checked me in seperately, charging me for an additional room. When I tried to get all of this straightened out, one member of the front desk staff was incredibly rude to me. He refused to answer my questions and mocked me for being concerned about being charged for a room I wasn't staying in. He actually said \"It's just money, it's not the end of your life.\" Eventually I was able to speak to the manager, who did remove the extra charges after a lengthy discussion. He was very intimidating and initially maintained that I was at fault for the mixup. But he eventually agreed to charge me only a reservation cancellation fee. For a reservation that I never should have had! But I gave up at that point, as I was only being charged $30 extra rather than $300. Dealing with this situation ate up several hours of my trip to New York, and pretty much ruined the whole trip for me. As for the hotel itself, it was in a good location, but it was run-down and somewhat dirty. The wallpaper was peeling and the carpet had holes in it. It was definitely NOT worth the price I was paying (even when I was charged for only one room!) I later wrote a complaint to the Red Roof Inn parent company about the problems with my reservation and the outrageous response of the front desk staffer. Following my complaint, I received a phone call from the manager of the hotel, who berated me for contacting the company instead of him and told me that what I had said about the front desk staff couldn't possibly be true. I was in tears by the end of the phone call. He asked me to contact Red Roof Inn again to tell them that he had helped me and that he had fixed every problem that I brought to his attention. While it's true that he helped me to fix the problems I had, I thought that his response to my complaint was very inappropriate.

It is about a 3 minute walk to Macy's, 5 minutes to Madison Square Garden and about 10 minutes to Times Square. When the reviews say it is in Koreatown it is really just one street and has a lot of restaurants which were always very busy. We were out quite late at night and always felt safe. There are always plenty of poeple around especially if you don't head away from the main streets. We had room 1502 with a fantastic view of the Empire State Building from our window. After reading other reviews I was really surprised by the size of the room. By American standards it was pretty big and certainly bigger than the one we had in SF last year. Of course by European standards it was enormous! We had one large bed which was really comfortable and huge. The room was cleaned and bed changed every day without fail. Wasn't that impressed by the breakfast but there were plenty of great places to eat not far from the hotel. Check in and out was very smooth and the hotel happily held onto our luggage for us the final day before we headed to the airport.

We checked out the reviews on Tripadvisor.com and found most of them to be favorable so we decided to go ahead and book a 9 night stay, from Sept. 24 to Oct. 2. LOCATION - The hotel in located in W32nd St. between 5th and Broadway, in that area known as Korea Town. This is actually good for Asian tourists because of the proliferation of 24 hour Korean restaurants, serving authentic and affordable meals. The hotel is just around the corner from the Empire State Building, a hop and a skip from Macy's and H&M, Forever 21, the Manhattan Mall and other shopping destinations. Just walk up 5th Ave. and you'll hit the NY Public Library, the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick's, FAO Scwarz, the entrance to Central Park ... the hotel is great for just taking long leisurely walks to shopping and sightseeing destinations. Take the M4 bus all the way to Cloisters, it passes right by the hotel, take the Q32 all the way to Jackson Heights in Queens to all the ethnic restaurants -- and a few steps away from the hotel, at the corner of 32nd and Broadway is a subway station for the N R W line that takes you to Union Square, Chinatown and everywhere. The hotel is also very close to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, and Times Square -- everything is within walking distance. FACILITIES - As to the hotel facilities, the rooms are average sized, we had a king bed and cable tv and the room and the beddings were clean and comfortable. The room and bathroom were kept clean throughout our stay. The soap they provide is lousy so bring your own soap and shampoo. FREE BREAKFAST - There is free breakfast on the 2nd floor, up to 10 am, which we went to only twice during our stay -- they have bagels and doughnuts and jam and butter and coffee and juice. We opted to enjoy more of what New York had to offer and enjoyed brunches in quaint places throughout the city -- but if a continental breakfast is fine with you, the free bagels and rolls are good value for the rate you paid for. CHECK IN - I was momentarily nonplussed at check in because I had requested for a) non-smoking floor, b) higher floor with room number ending in 02 or 03 c) a view of the Empire State building. Instead, I got a smoking room on the 6th floor albeit with the requested 03 ending. The 6th floor is not high enough to block out the noises from the street below specially late at night, when all the garbage trucks are picking up the garage. I expressed my disappointment but the lady who handled the check in said there were no more non smoking rooms on non smoking floors. When I countered that I had requested for a non smoking room, they said that preferences were just that and could not always be met. I was afraid that the room would be stuffy and mentioned that 9 nights was too long a stay if I hated the room but she did say that rooms were aired and deodorized so definitely, the room would not be stuffy or would not smell of smoke. Thankfully, she was correct but if you are very sensitive to smoke -- perhaps you can follow up your reservation with a phone call to the hotel to make sure you do get what you requested for. PHONE CALLS - The hotel claims that you can make free phone calls within the 212 area code but we tried several times but couldn't get through -- we were never able to make use of the free service. You always get a busy signal. A friend who also stayed in the same hotel had the same experience and we ended up using our own mobile phones to call. What's the use of saying there are free calls when no one can ever get through? SERVICE - Reviews I read about the hotel were equally split between raves about the service and rants. I found the service at the front desk perfunctory but then again -- it's not the Ritz. Maid service was on the ball and rooms were cleaned thoroughly and on time and that was more important to me during our stay. We hardly needed anything from the front desk or the concierge so it wasn't an issue that they were not too friendly -- except for one night manager who was quite accommodating about a package I wanted them to keep for a friend.

The hotel lobby was nicely updated with marble walls, a concierge stand, front desk and a second level cocktail bar that too was comfortable and inviting. Check in was painless and upon arriving to our room, we were pleased that albeit a little on the small side - it wasn't too small and certainly was clean, smell-free and had everything we needed for a comfortable night's stay. The nicely tiled bathroom was very clean and had all the little hotel amenities (soap/cups/shampoo/etc) and plenty of towels. The best part about this hotel is it's location! You're on the same block as a subway entrance so it's great to be able to get the all day Metro Card and make our way through various parts of the island. It's an easy walk to Madison Square Garden, The Empire State Building and a whole lot of shopping stores. Keep in mind - once outside the hotel, you are in the middle of Korean Town with a lot of hustle and bustle and 24-hour sushi/karaoke bars. At night - the trash is piled up high but any smells we encountered were minimal. There is also a parking garage in the same block and the hotel does offer discounted parking. In our case - we parked the car and took cabs and the subway for the three days that we were there. Parking for our oversized Suburban was $35. Smaller cars about $25/day - One time in/out. I highly recommend this hotel especially if you're only planning on spending a minimal amount of time actually in the hotel as we did.

Iron, ironing board, TV, movies and Nintendo games available on demand (for a fee), coffee making facilities were all available in the room. Vending and/or ice machines were available on all floors from 2-17. The breakfast is simple but considering most hotels only offer food as an extra we were very glad of this most mornings. Tea, coffee or juices, cereal, toast, bagels or donuts were on offer here until 10am. Small but practical as long as you didnt leave it until the last minute to get here. The staff we dealt with were friendly although this was limited to checking in and out as we had no problems once we got settled. We had a noon checkout but our bus shuttle didnt depart until later in the afternoon so we were very glad to be able to leave our luggage safe for a few hours behind the front desk to allow us some final hours out shopping. We used the NY airport service from JFK on arrival which dropped us at Penn station. This was about a 5 minute walk from the hotel (with luggage) and on the return journey the concierge at the hotel arranged for us to be collected at the front door of the hotel. For $54, both of us had a comfortable return journey to/from the airport. As for sightseeing, I would recommend the Top of the Rock as a very good alternative if you want to avoid the very busy empire state building.

We got a 50% off coupon for Beauty and the Beast. AWESOME SHOW! Kids and adults alike. Hairspray was by far our favorite. Great for the entire family. We were lucky enough to get our name in a drawing for tickets 3 hours before curtain. Two front row center seat tickets for $25! Central Park is gorgeous. If you have kids, go to the zoo. Small selection, but laid out nicely. IF you need to give your feet a rest, go on the 3 hour tour, (don't be afraid, you won't ge shipwrecked) on the Circleline Tour. Very relaxing and informative.

The price was right and the location was described as being very good. Upon check in, I requested a room with an Empire State view and received it. In the initial inspection of the smallish room, I discovered these strange little bugs all over the faucet in the bath tub. I could not tell if they were roaches, spiders, fruit flies or what. They were very small, moving all over the place, and I was grossed out. To the hotel\u2019s credit, they sent someone up to check out the situation immediately. I requested another room and was given one without hesitation. The next room was bigger, but we lost our Empire State view. After venturing around the city etc., we retired for the evening. I woke up around 4 a.m. and discovered a bedbug on a towel we had spread out on the bathroom floor. From information obtained through Trip advisor, an AAA article, TV, I was well aware that it was a bedbug. I decided at that point to check out and find another hotel. I didn\u2019t want to risk staying there because my feeling was, if there was one bed bug, then there are many. I took pictures of the bug for future proof and I showed the bug to the people at the front desk. They told me the general manager would not be in until Monday. I wanted to get a refund for the inconvenience and the overall negative experiences. It was a rainy Saturday morning at 6:00 a.m., but off my sister and I went in search of another hotel. We stayed at the Carlton on Madison Ave. and had a marvelous stay there. I wrote a review for them too. (Carlton Treated Us Like Royalty) It was more expensive, not as good of a location, but we felt comfortable and welcomed from the start. I returned to the Red roof on Monday and talked to the manager. Despite his insistence that they take such matters very seriously, this was the first time he was hearing about my case. He took my name and information and informed me an investigation would have to be done, etc. Needless to say he called the next day. They owned up to the bugs in the first room, but not the bedbug in the second room. He assured me this was something the Red Roof organization took very seriously. Within a day, an inspector supposedly checked the room; a new mattress was purchased, etc. He offered free accommodations for the future, but I declined. I just wanted to get a refund, but he credited half of the one night stay back. I say beware. The location was good, the price was right, but the risk of carrying insects home is a huge concern.

I am a Houstonian and just got back from my visit from this wonderful city with my 20 year old son. I will talk about my overall visit before I mention this particular hotel. I want to give you some insight to help you make your trip more enjoyable. We checked in on Tuesday, May 16th, after a taxi brought us from the airport. The taxi from LaGuardia was $ 34.50 and returing to the airport it was $ 26.50. I can't explain the price difference, but there is one $ 4.50 toll fare added to the actual meter amount. If you are staying at the Red Roof Inn, fly into LaGuardia as it is about $ 15.00 cheaper each way for taxis than JFK, which is a flat fee of $ 45 . My son and I went there to see three NY Yankee games (vs Rangers) and we wanted to see all of the big, non-museum tourist sights. If you are going to be here for for 4 days or more and want to see as much of the city as possible, I suggest a couple of things: 1) Get some good walking shoes, as walking is the best way to see the city 2) Get a $ 24 Unlimited Use Metro Card, which will give us unlimited rides on the subway and public city buses for 7 days. 3) Get a good NYC Guide Book. We used Frommers. I recommend starting a walking program so you will be ready for your NYC advanture. The subways are fun to ride, and safe. We probably walked 5-6 miles a day and rode the subways up and down the city, into Brooklyn and all over the place. Subways are a New York experience you have to try. There are always people to ask if you get confused, and most of the people were fairly nice. If you are a baseball fan, you MUST see a Yankees game. There are no other fans or stadium like Yankee Stadium, and it's a fairly easy ride via the 4 train via the subwaysubway. One word of caution: The Yankee Stadium security people will NOT allow your large bag into the stadium, but a place right behind the stadium will check your bag for $ 5.00 and put your stuff in a clear bag. You can retrieve your bag after the game. The place and whole street is something no baseball fan should miss. If you are gonna see the Empire State Building, get there at sunset and stay 30-40 minutes until it's night and all the city lights are on. It's gorgeous. Buy your tickets online in advance. We rode the 3-hour Circle Line Tour around the city. Our guide was kinda hokey, but it was fun and educational. The Statue Of Liberty is a beautiful thing to see in person, as is Ellis Island. One of the best things we did was walk from Brooklyn back towards Manhattan on the Brooklyn Bridge. It's spectacular. If you do this, you can take the subway to Brooklyn, have lunch at the famous Grimaldi's Pizzaria, and then walk the 30-45 walk back. I visited Nathans at Coney Island, and yes, the hot dogs justify all the hype. They are very, very good. The walk back over the Brooklyn Bridge takes you past City Hall and that is an easy walk to Wall Street and Ground Zero. Central Park is beautiful too, and we had lunch at Mickey Mantle's across the street and next door to the Ritz Carlton. You must visit Rockefeller Center and Times Square, and Grand Central Station. They are NYC experiences. I could go on and on, but I'll stop and talk now about the hotel. I do STRONGLY reccommend getting use to a lot of walking. Most of the time you can walk faster than the traffic. Time's Square at 10:30-11:00 pm when a lot of the shows end is a madhouse.... packed, but fun. It has a tremendous amount of energy. It's eletric!!!! If you need a need a good NYC pizza place in Time's Square, try John's on 44th Street. It's in a cool building that use to be a church, and it's directly across the street from where Phantom Of The Opera plays. OKay, the hotel. It's an ideal location and only a block or two from the Empire State Building. If you are in Times Square and want to make the walk back, just walk towards the Empire State Building and you'll find your hotel. It's that easy. The hotel is pretty centrally-located, so you can walk just about anywhere in midtown easily. We stayed in a room without a view of the ESB, and the clerk told us none of the 2-double bed rooms have an ESB view, only kings. Our room was # 708, and it was very quiet. The beds were comfy, and water pressure and everything was okay. The toilet flush is obscenely loud, but that's okay. I suggest bringing your own bar of Dial or whatever you use, as the soap provided is pretty lame. The towels are okay, and shampoo and lotion is provided. Unfortunately it's true that the drains in the tub don't work so quickly, and there was 3-4\" of standing water during your shower. It's MY water, so I didn't care. Please note that there is an air conditioner in the room, but the thermostat controls aren't operable (at least not in # 708. You can turn the fan off and on, but you can't control the temp from your room. I like it cold (73-74) and you have to INSIST when you call down to make sure they turn the temp way down. It will blow cold for a while, then cycle to warm air for a while so it won't freeze up (so they say). If you need an average temp room like a normal person, it's probably won't even be an issue and you'll sleep very well. The elevators aren't as slow as some reviewers are saying. The complimentary breakfast was good, and included bagels, doughnuts, OJ, coffee, fruit and Oatmeal. It's on the 2nd floor, so go down to the lobby for for your complimentary USA Today before you go eat. Overall, this is a very clean and basic hotel. It's on a street with Korean restaurants, but it's nice. We only wanted the hotel for a base and place to sleep at night. Our NYC vacation was very busy, and you can miss a lot if you sleep late. If money is no object and you need luxury, and need a beautiful hotel to lounge around in, don't stay here.

Went to New York with a sister and brother and we shared a room with two double beds. The room was plenty big and comfortable. Quiet too! We were on the 11th floor and had no trouble with elevators. Not much of a view but who has time to sit in a hotel room in New York City and look out the window anyway! Only complaint would be they did not serve coffee in the small bar and we wanted a late night coffee topped off with amerretto. No minnie bottles either or we would have made our own as we did have a coffee maker in our room. One reccommendation. Go to Carmines restaurant, it was great.

We complained again in the morning and were moved room once more - this time to the 11th floor. Our 3rd room was again comfortable and didn't differ much at all from the previous 2 rooms, other than the pipes in this bathroom didn't make a sound (other than the ones you'd expect anyway). We didn't have the fantastic views but, hey, all we really wanted was a base and somewhere we could get an uninterrupted night's sleep. We didn't take advantage of the breakfast which was included in our room rate, instead we took advantage of the fantastic delis and coffee bars that NYC has to offer.

The rooms were extremely clean (no signs of roaches or rodents) and just large enough for 2 people in each room with luggage. Each room had a single king bed. The rooms were not large, but they were fine for our needs (sleeping and getting ready to see the city.) Our only problems with the hotel probably have to do with the age of the building. There were a few noise issues. The air conditioners in both rooms used by our group rattled and coughed their way through cooling. Changing the temperature guage on the units did not change the noise, just the frequency of the noise. Every time the a/c would kick on, it would thump loudly and the wall unit would vibrate noisily. We were tired enough each night from all our sight-seeing, it rarely woke us up. It was more of an annoyance. The second noise factor was the pipes banging. On a regualr basis we would hear loud bangs from the bathroom. In my room, we simply kept the bathroom door closed to cut off the sound, in our friends' room, they got more creative: they turned off the water supply to the toilet, and that stopped the problem - you just have to remember to turn the knob and get the water flowing to it again before flushing! As others have said, the elevators are slow, but it wasn't a problem. As I said, we were on the top floor, and we never had to wait long for an elevator. The only advice I can give is this: If you can, try to avoid a room by the elevators. My friends' room was next to the elevator, and the doors close loudly and woke them up often during the night. Other than these few problems, the hotel was fantastic. It is near a subway stop, and walkable to many places (the view out our window was the Empire State Building - just a block away!)

I pointed out that my confirmation clearly stated 2 rooms, booked for a total of 4 people, for 3 nights but he continued to argue.

What more could one ask for $120 a night in Manhattan? Area is Korea Town/Herald Square - great tourist area (near Macy's, Empire State etc). As a New Yorker myself (Brooklynite), I try to avoid this area with my life (too crazy and filled with tourists, and honestly, not the prettiest). If you want to be in the thick of it...it's perfect. If you're the kind of tourist who likes to avoid touristy areas, you may not like the area. Still, it's such a deal that I would still suggest it - getting out of the area is easy anyway - with 2 of the most convenient subway lines located on the very same block to get you anywhere!

The Red Roof offers a free continental brekfast (rare in NYC) but unfortunately the other guests took full advantage of this and horded food like it was the last meal that they were going to eat. One woman had a huge plate of jelly donuts that she must have been saving for a snack later since I can't imagine anyone eating 6 donuts at one sitting. The guests filling the breakfast area were rude and pushy, and many did not have the common courtesy to clean up after themselves. Another drawback was that there was a sign posted that stated \"All Food Musy Be Eaten on Premises\".

This place was definitely worth the $159/night (AAA discount) --\"above average\" for the price and I would stay here again. I found the staff to be accomodating...They let us check in a few hours early and gave us a room facing the Empire State Building. Overly friendly? No, but what do you REALLY expect from someone living in NYC and working at a Red Roof Inn??? After some of the comments I read on this sight I wasn't quite sure what to expect. We called down for extra towels soon after we got in the room and they sent 4 more up withing 5 minutes--no problem and no attitude. Also, they let us check out an hour late (no charge) and we appreciated that. We didn't have much more contact with the staff other than what I just listed. The room appeared clean with a slightly strong bleach-like odor but it dissipated after a while. Air conditioner worked well (that's one I worried about w/ the 90 degree weather)...The mattress was quite comfortable, although I read an earlier comment that it was really hard--I totally disagree...I can see where it could be noisy if your room is by the elevator or the ice/vending machines, but \"NYC never sleeps\" so it'd be ridiculous to complain about outdoor noise--which wasn't bad from the 14th floor...The elevators were somewhat slow but never had to wait more than a minute or two--except Sunday morning during what was presumably the breakfast rush\" around 9:45. The so-called \"breakfast\" is fine if you want to grab a quick bagel [good] and coffee [mediocre] early before you head out. The \"cappucino\" was actually pretty good if you like the taste of instant hot chocolate. A couple of other things: 1) Pizza Pete's has EXCELLENT pizza--right out the hotel then right around the 1st corner. 2) Take cabs if it isn't during weekday rush-hour traffic--they're almost always quicker than the subway and barely more costly if you're not going too-too far.

The Red Roof brand is a budget-type hotel and this property reflects that. I'm a bit surprised by the many \"4-Star\" ratings as that would indicate that this hotel is \"Above Average\" which in my opinion it is not in any way at all. It's just a good, basic hotel. It has some shortcomings, but overall I felt it was a good enough bargain to warrant an \"Average\" rating. This hotel is in a fantastic location very near Macy's, the Empire State Building (just one short block away) with a subway station at the end of the block. Times Square is a quick 15 minute walk north. The lobby is small but nicely appointed. It could, however, benefit greatly from better air conditioning as the lobby was always on the warm side (and I'm from Texas so I'm used to heat). The rooms aren't going to make the pages of Architectural Digest anytime soon but the furniture, while outdated, is in good shape. The room was average to a bit larger than many NYC hotel rooms (which are notoriously small). There were plenty of clothes hangers in the small closet and a generous amount of drawer space to store my things. I was, however, disappointed by the lack of an in-room safe. The bedding is of modest quality and the mattress incredibly hard. If you like firm mattresses you'll be fine, but I really missed my pillow-top mattress back home. Towels were a bit thin and small. Toiletries are of budget quality and I was happy that I'd brought my own soap and shampoo. The water pressure was very good and hot water was abundant. Like the lobby, the air conditioner in the room really needed some help. The room never did cool off adequately even with the unit on high. The unit also switched itself off a couple of times requiring a call to the front desk. I guess they must have thrown a breaker or something because it would come back on after my call without requiring an engineer to come to the room. The hotel claims to have free wireless Internet access in all rooms and while this is technically accurate, the service leaves much to be desired. Unfortunately the signal was terribly weak and the transmission rate was pathetic, often dropping out entirely. The hotel staff member I spoke to about this indicated that this was a typical problem but that there was nothing he could do about it. If you have much work to do on your trip that requires Internet connectivity I would recommend seeking a hotel more adequately equipped to handle the needs of business travelers.

First in Hicksville on Long Island, with one night at the Essex House as a treat and then at two different Comfort Inns. Aside from the luxury of the Essex House (along with a high price) the Red Roof Inn was the best place I've stayed. I primarily picked this hotel because my husband and I wanted a king sized bed like at home. The other hotels we stayed at all had tiny doubles. The price was good too, $139 a night which is a bargain for NYC. We booked directly through Red Roof Inns website. The hotel is located in Little Korea with lots of Korean restaurants in the neighborhood. We found one place right down the street that looked like a market at first but they had a great buffet in the back. They had some American food like meatloaf, mac & cheese and mashed potatoes, some Korean choices like kimchee, etc. and some really good Chinese food. It's a pay by the pound buffet. They also had a deli counter with sandwiches and other choices. It was really great but I can't remember the name. When you come out the the hotel it's to the left, a few doors down. The hotel lobby is nice sized and check in was easy. The staff is efficient but not overly friendly. We stayed in room 1407. The elevators are a little slow especially in the mornings when everyone is leaving their rooms. They must not have a service elevator because we frequently encountered staff taking the elevators. The people we spoke to were nice and very polite. Our room was quite big by NYC standards. Good sized bathroom with a tub and shower and plently of space to put toiletries. There is a blow dryer but no full length mirror. Complimentary shampoo, soap, etc. The bathroom was nice and clean. In the room was a closet with plenty of hangers, an ironing board and iron and a stand for a suitcase. Furnishings were in good shape with plenty of drawer space, two nightstands, a dresser, a desk with a chair and an extra chair. Very nice king sized bed with two extra pillows in the closet. There was one phone on the nightstand along with an alarm clock and another phone on the desk. Two big windows that do open and nice black out curtains. We did have a little trouble with the room temperature the first night. We like to sleep with the fan on for white noise but the room got pretty warm. The next day we called down to the front desk and asked that the heat be turned off. Less than a half hour we were called back and said it had been taken care of. We slept much cooler and more comfortably after that. Even though there was construction going on next door we could not hear it with the windows closed and the fan going. Not much noise in the hallways either. The maid service was good and they were very accomadating with us not leaving the room sometimes until almost noon. The TV worked fine. We never used the Nintendo stuff or the internet that you can do through the TV. I did notice that there was no safe in the room which I think would be a good idea. I feel much better leaving stuff in my room if it's locked up. Subway is close as well as plenty of non-Korean food, fast food, pizza, etc. The Empire State Building is right around the corner, Macy's an easy walk. If you like Irish bars, try Foley's around the corner on W. 33rd. Generous drinks at good prices. Gareth the bartender was great. As mentioned in other reviews, rooms ending in 10 are very small. We saw a diagram of the room layouts and you can definately tell that they are much smaller. Looks like rooms ending in 7 or 6 are the largest. The smaller rooms are the ones in the front, facing the Empire State Building. I would definately stay at the Red Roof Inn again and highly recommend it if you are looking for an affordable, clean hotel with larger than average NYC sized rooms.", "Date": "May 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, UK", "Title": "\u201cManhattan is amazing!!\u201d", "Author": "dinky", "ReviewID": "UR3470525", "Content": "Me and my friend stayed in the Red Roof Inn in Manhattan, 20/04/2005 to 24/04/2005 I payed $593.44 for four nights which was brilliant, as the hotel is clean, especially after the reviews i read about some hotels and they were more expensive.

Got a reasonable location near the Empire State, close to subway and Macy's, but in a Korean neighbourhood with the characteristic piles of rubbish bags outside the restaurants every day. First room we were given, despite having rung the hotel in advance to request a quiet room with a decent view, was small and cramped with a terrible view, made worse by the constant racket from the ice machine just outside - to add insult to injury, it didn't even dispense any ice, so we had to go 2 floors down to get some, and the hotel staff said they couldn't switch it off! Moved next day to another room on the same floor with view of the Empire State - much larger and better furnished, really quite comfortable, and we could only just hear the ice machine. Free breakfast comprised good quality orange juice, tea/coffee, doughnuts, bagels, toast, porridge and fruit - downside was that the breakfast room was far too small, so there was often standing room only, with a dash for a table as soon as one became free. Also too hot, as the air con was invariably switched off. Apparently there is free wireless high-speed internet access in the rooms, although they don't advertise it very well so I didn't bother taking my laptop. There are a couple of cheap internet cafes virtually next door, so don't use the TV-based system in the rooms, which is expensive. Staff were OK - moved our luggage to the new room for us while we were out, concierge booked us on the minibus shuttle back to JFK for $21/person, which only took 40 minutes (30 from picking up the last passengers) leaving at 7.30 pm - taxi would have been $55 plus tolls and couldn't have been any quicker. Didn't find any decent restaurants nearby, just loads of fast-food places, although I guess there was a good choice of Korean, which we didn't try as we had no idea what to expect. Very convenient for going up the Empire State at night - after an aborted attempt at 7.30, when the wait would have been 60-75 minutes, we went at about 10.30 pm, when there was absolutely nobody in the queue and the views were spectacular.

It is also close to the subways and to many tourist sites(Empire State Building) and shopping (Macy's, 5th Ave, and speciality shops). There are many Korean restaurants in the block of the hotel--some are open 24 hrs. Free breakfast is good -- bagels, donuts, oatmeal (no cold cereal), bananas and apples. Opens at 7am. Other nearby coffee shops open earlier. Bar has high priced drinks -- try some where else in the neighborhood. Some front desk staff were more helpful than others.", "Date": "February 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ontario, canada", "Title": "\u201cA great place to rest our weary legs!\u201d", "Author": "wooz", "ReviewID": "UR3220307", "Content": "We really enjoyed the Red Roof Inn.

I went back to the front desk and was immediately given a much better room on a higher floor ( try to stay out of the rooms that end in 10) The breakfast room was well stocked and busy, it allowed a great opportunity to meet fellow travellers.

The location was really really great, our room looked out on the Empire State Building and with the subway close by you could get to anywhere in the city quickly. The complimentary breakfast was great - doughnuts, bagels, toast, fruit, coffee, tea, porridge and fruit juice. The food was really fresh and the buffet was kept well stocked. The staff were nice and helpful. Its not the Four Seasons so don't expect a top class hotel, but its everything you need and the price is very reasonable. There are so many ways to spend your money in New York - it really doesn't make sense to waste it on a hotel that you won't spend much time in anyway.

We found shopping early to be the answer to beat crowds as they get really busy in the afternoon and evening. Century 21 nr. ground zero is def worth a visit . Some electrical shops are closed friday pm and saturdays. We found walking the best way to get around, took us about 10-15 mins to get to Times Square and about 25 mins to get to central park (i recommend the ice-skating).

The bathroom suites were exceptionally clean - typical hotel bath, not very deep, but I prefer to shower after a long day walking round Manhattan Island - clean sheets every day, sounds like a silly thing to say, but if you're used to English hotels then you'll know what a novelty this is. Breakfast was simple and filling. Bagels, oats (porridge), lots of fruit juice, fresh fruit, tea coffee. The staff were amazingly helpful, especially during the two minor emergencies we had during the stay. The hotel is less than spitting distance from 5th Avenue and the Empire State Building. Manhattan Mall and Macy's are only 5 minutes away. Madison Square Garden less than 10 minutes away. At only around $200 (115 GBP) per night for two adults and two children to stay this close to the centre of New York, I really can't recommend this hotel enough.

Be warned though that the breakfast room is very busy and sometimes you have to wait for a table. They also close PROMPTLY at 10:00 am. We had a double-bed room on the 6th floor.

We asked for extra pillows and our request was looked after immediately. There are only 2 elevators and they were really slow when busy but nothing to be overly concerned about. Subway station is within half a block and the best way to get around the city. We were leery at first of taking it but the people in NY were very helpful and we had no problems getting around after the first couple of times of using it. Cab drivers are CRAZY so we opted to use the subway wherever possible. With the hotel being on Korea street, there aren't many American restaurants closeby - there is a Burger King and Wendys just up the street and around the corner though for a quick meal. Hotel is really close to Macys (a great place to shop) and about a 10 minute walk to Times Square. Take the double decker bus tour around the city - a great way to see all the sites.
