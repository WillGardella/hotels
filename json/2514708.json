The hotel makes for a nice weekend getaway. The room was large, clean and comfortable. The room was decorated in a very modern style, the shower was great, and the room was quiet at night. It is three long blocks from Times Square and the theaters -- about a 15 minute walk. There are lot of pedestrians out at night and the location felt safe. The hotel is close to Grand Central Station A few down sides -- they charge for internet service, even though the room had a mini kitchen, there was no coffee maker, and the breakfast prices at the hotel\u2019s restaurant were way too expensive. However, there are several good restaurants and coffee shops close to the hotel. We booked the room last minute and got a rate for about $110 on Priceline using their blind bidding approach. We were told that we were upgraded when we got to the hotel to a nicer room on a higher floor. After we checked out of our room on Sunday, we checked our bags with the concierge so we could explore more of NYC. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. We would stay there again if we were able to get a similar rate. The hotel is rated as a 4 star hotel on Priceline; it is probably should be rated as a very nice three star hotel.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao paulo", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice for leading members\u201d", "Author": "felipevaz", "ReviewID": "UR127350848", "Content": "Get yourself a leading hotels membership and stay here with an upgrade, breakfast and nice rate.

A bit further out, but still walkable are Times Square/Broadway, Rockerfeller Center, St. Patrick's Cathedral, the Chrysler Building, and much more. The Price (via Priceline): I booked via Priceline after researching a bidding strategy via a priceline bidding strategy messageboard so I know I got the lowest possible Priceline price. For this hotel it was a steal possible only because the UN was not in session. However, I wouldn't want to pay rack rate or rates offered on other websites. Room Size: Excellent by NYC standards. (Standard room) The Lobby Staff: The bellmen, doormen, porters, etc. were excellent. I feel bad that didn't always get a chance to tip them, etc. Nice people and very helpful. Desk staff mostly ok. THE AVERAGE: Decor: It is average for a 4* hotel. Interesting but nice. The room could use an update. It shows a fair amount of wear. Some chipped tile/tub in the bathroom. Tub is nice and deep but narrow. And you have to have some muscles in your fingers to flush the toilet. Does not look nearly as nice as the photos online. We had a view of 45th and the building across the street. Boring and a little noisy. Beds: Comfortable, but nothing special. I requested 2 beds but did not get them (not guaranteed by priceline but it would have been nice.) Consierge: We asked for suggestions on a restaurant that would be entertaining and for two teens and 3 40somethings. He was challenged by this. In NYC with 1000s of restaurants, a consierge should be able to name numerous restaurants to choose from. One of his first offerings was Bubba Gumps. Unfortunately, 2 of us were from Louisiana and Bubba Gump's does not fly with our expert knowledge of such southern/gulf cuisine. We settled for Brother Jimmy's BBQ (ok even tho, again, 2 of us were from the south). He said it would be lively. Well, lively apparently meant really really loud music with happy hour with tons of 20somethings in the bar area. So, not appropriate when we wanted something \"lively\" for teens. However, the food very good. THE BAD: Room Temperature: It is winter and the heat is ON. The room was generally too warm for us (72'-75'F) when healthy sleep temp is 65'F. The only way to cool the room is open the window but then there is the street noise. Housekeeping: Generally clean, but... I did the \"I'm in NYC so I need to check for bed bugs check when I arrived (I found NONE an probably no evidence of any.) and noticed some small blood stains (?) on the underneath side of the white comforter/duvet. I did not complain as I always take it off the bed immediately anyway because I don't trust hotels to change them between guests. The Alex might, but I do this at all hotels. Seriously, how often do you see them on the housekeeping carts? Housekeeping didn't leave enough toiletries or replenish when needed, in my opinion. After the first day, I didn't bother to tip because of this and an incident (read below). THE WORST: Housekeeping: On my final day there, I had the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door. I did not have the inside locks enaged because my friend just left the room within the last half hour or so. I was in the room getting dressed after a shower. So, I was in a towel. Guess what happens? I am a female, and a male housekeeper knocks on the door and walks in unannounced before I have a chance to see who it was through the peep hole (I thought it might be my friend returning with Starbucks or something). And yes, there I am barely in a towel. COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE. COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. Had he said \"housekeeping\" or waited a minute before opening the door or READ THE DO NOT FRIKIN DISTURB SIGN the situation could have been avoided. NOT happy at all about this. When I checked out, the desk agent didn't ask how was my stay, otherwise I would have reported this incident. But, I knew I had this public forum to speak. OVERALL: The Alex Hotel isn't bad and if you chose to stay there you will probably be perfectly fine. In my case, it was simply not as positive as I hoped for or expected given the mostly positive reviews. I had a mostly ok stay for a decent price. But, I left a bit disappointed because I had higher expectations.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Great Dunmow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAdequate Hotel, Extortionate breakfast, pleasant staff\u201d", "Author": "Garyorient", "ReviewID": "UR125027785", "Content": "Came on a 3 day stay with partner and her son from London.

When we arrived in our room, we thought they had made a mistake and given us the smaller room. When we called down to confirm, they said that we were in the right room and they didn't know why the pictures on Expedia reflected a larger room. When I asked what room they were showing, the staff looked up the pictures but weren't sure what room was being shown because we were in the largest room, other than the penthouse and the pictures were not of the penthouse. Even the beds were small. For tall people, your feet hang off the end. The next issue was the showers in the morning. We couldn't get one working and the other one's shower head fell off when we turned it on. The staff arrived immediately to fix the situation. We were disappointed that we had to pay for WIFI for each device we had. Needless to say, I made a trip to Starbucks every morning, to plot out our day.

We stayed for three nights. I called ahead of time and spoke with the Manager, Mary Lou Pollock, who assured me that we would receive excellent service. She did not follow up, nor did she make us feel welcome. At the outset, I was told that breakfast was only for two people (in our two bedroom suite with two king beds). If I had booked two separate rooms which would have cost less, I would have had breakfast for four. They did agree to include breakfast for three. There was also an issue because they wanted to charge an additional fee for the third person in the two bedroom suite. This also did not make sense to me because we had two king bedrooms. The suite was pretty stark and very small. The furniture in the living room area i was very low to the ground, not too comfortable. The beds were comfortable. The elevator system was very quirky.

We added 2 nights to give us 4 days in New York, which i must admit is barely time to scrape the surface of this wonderful city. You really need a minimum of 1 week to get a real feel for the city. Problems started the minute we arrived with the room we were allocated being more like a dungeon on the third floor overlooking the dumpster in the back alley. We were expecting a light filled room with a view given that we were paying $400 plus for the room. We lodged a complaint given that we were staying extra nights and were allocated a dungeon on a higher floor. We decided to persist and tried again, this time requesting a higher floor and a room with a front street view. Being very specific seemed to help as we were then allocated a semi-spacious room on a high floor. Being fair, the rooms were clean with reasonable air-conditioning. From a reception service point of view it seemed to depend on the people that were on duty as to whether the service was good or poor, so overall i would classify it as mediocre. The last day topped it all off when we asked to have breakfast either slightly earlier than normal breakfast time or to have it in our room (early flight). We were advised that room service was not part of our package and that breakfast could not be served earlier in the restaurant. (mind you we had already paid for the breakfast supplement) As we were checking out we decided to create a small \"scene\" and were afforded a cup of coffee. Small recompense!! The hotel is not centrally located and is a few blocks from a subway station and a long walk to 5th Avenue and the shopping area around Times Square. Since arriving home, I have spoken to my brother-in-law who travels to New York regularly on business and advised me to try the Belvedere Hotel which is a beautiful hotel only 2 blocks from Times Square.

The bed had Frette linen and was gloriously comfortable, and of course there was the obligatory flat panel television, a stereo CD player with iPod dock, and a DVD player.

And a \u201cKing sized bed\u201d in Manhattan should be referred to as a \u201cNew York King,\u201d in contrast to a \u201cCalifornia King.\u201d Unless you are prepared to pay something similar to the national debt of a small country, everything in Manhattan is smaller than you might otherwise expect. London and Paris are no different. That said, The Alex is a delightful little hotel. Well-located between Grand Central Station and the United Nations, near 45th Street and Third Avenue, it is within walking distance to Times Square and the Theater District. Be prepared for Retro. Apparently, the intention is to create an oriental motif, but all I really got out of it was a stylish 1964. Think about a lot of white formica and wood with a little embellishment. The tiny sofa next to the kitchen area served little purpose and might have been better replaced by a couple of chairs. I can\u2019t imagine trying to entertain guests there. The room was large by Manhattan standards, and I was most impressed by the accoutrements and amenities that they were able to fit into the room. I could have stayed there for three weeks if it weren\u2019t in downtown New York and had a plethora of excellent restaurants nearby. There was a full-sized refrigerator, with freezer and icemaker, a dishwasher, a full stove, a microwave, and all of the necessary silverware, glassware, and pots and pans you might find in a small apartment. The hotel mini bar was, essentially, a full-sized stocked refrigerator. But with so many restaurants around, who wants to sit in the room and cook? The clothes and coat closet (with the now-common in-room safe) was in a partition that created a little vestibule and provided the kitchen space on the other side. There were also three intriguing cabinets along the wall opposite the bed, which made getting around the end of the bed a little crowded. One of them acted as a sometime closet, not very well designed, to complement the full closet by the door. The second contained an entertainment center with flat panel television, stereo CD player with iPod dock, and a DVD player. Instructions as to how to work it all would have been helpful for the less technically-oriented. The third contained an interesting little work station, with a fold-out desk, a multitude of little cubby-holes and drawers, and a lamp and trash basket that swung out when needed but could all be hidden behind the panels of the cabinet. Truth be told, however, the work space was not particularly practical for my purposes, and I would not really recommend the hotel for an extended business stay. Mine was short. The bathroom was comparatively large, the tub was deep, the towels were thick and oversized, and the soaps and such were very pleasant. The television and telephone in the bathroom were a nice touch if one wanted to lounge in the tub and watch a ball game. The view from the room was outstanding. It was on the 31st floor, and the windows extended around the corner, so there was a beautiful corner view of the East River at the end of 45th Street, about five blocks away, and a wonderful view of the top of the Chrysler Building from the main window. If you were so inclined, you could go to sleep watching the lights of that magnificent building from your pillow. Both check-in and check-out were smooth and efficient, the staff was pleasant. The fact that they only have about six rooms on a floor made it deliciously quiet. You could sleep the day away if you weren\u2019t in Manhattan. What was missing? A clock, for one thing. There was an unlighted digital device that was largely useless. Meaning that I slept with my watch on.

After an hour of \"not our problem\" from the icy front desk (which never asked at checkout how our stay had been), hotel security came to tell me the same thing, after which I was told by yet another Alex staffer that I couldn't change the tire myself because they needed the curb space for new check-ins. I had to beg for help, explaining repeatedly that I was a woman traveling alone with two young daughters. Eventually, the valet parking garage guys helped me out, changing my tire for $100. Apparently, the Alex smiles nicely when you check in, but after that you're on your own, even for $1,100 in two days. The front desk refused even to cash a check for me so I could give the garage guys that sudden $100. They sent me up the street and around the corner to an ATM. The only bright spot was Brian, head of security, who made that second call to the garage for me after I begged him for help. But no one -- not a single person at the Alex -- lifted a finger to assist me with that flat tire, even though under bailment law it's their responsibility.

The website trumpets it's affiliation with The Leading Hotels of the World, a collection of unique, boutique hotels. We've had the pleasure in staying in many of them and have never been disappointed. The hotel had a few strange quirks we could live with: - The room we had (1603) was spacious and had a built in kitchen. But the bathroom was so small you could barely turn around. And the unit had no table. What is the point of a full kitchen if you have no where to sit down and eat? - The elevator system is downright confusing. Enter your floor, then wait for a car. But we experienced a few things in our one-night stay that were downright unacceptable: - The platform bed was the most uncomfortable thing I've ever slept on. I've slept more soundly on sleeper sofas. Not to mention the headboard protruded into the bed a good six inches. So this six footer's feet were dangling over the edge of the bed all night... - The building's air conditioning system was not operating on the night of our stay. Our room was over 80 degrees when we checked in. The friendly bellhop graciously turned on the air conditioning to cool the room. When we returned later in the evening, our room was up to 85 degrees, as even thought he put the thermostat on A/C, heat was coming into the room. The hotel manager's solution: Open the window (which only opened 3 inches wide) and the room will cool down quickly. Well, all that did was let in TONS of NYC noise. We woke multiple times during the night to sirens, cars and other city noises. But most of all, I have never stayed in a hotel with a non-functioning shower. We used the shower two times a piece during our stay, and neither one of us got more than 30 seconds until the water pressure dropped, resulting in the \"rainfall\" showerhead stopping and the water coming out of the tub spout. Despite a terrific location, friendly bellhops and a killer breakfast (included) the next morning we won't be staying at The Alex again. - The water pressure was so bad, the shower would stop flowing every few minutes, forcing you to fumble for the switch to get it flowing again", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cAs a member of the Leading Hotel of the World it lack glamour...\u201d", "Author": "Italian_in_Boston", "ReviewID": "UR96504665", "Content": "Stayed there in February 2011.

The Alex is a wonderful balance; if you need assistance navigating anything in the region, they are terrific in terms of help - if you wish to be left alone to enjoy your space, they are respectful. Its location is great, neither crammed into the surreal fantasy land of the crowded destination spots teeming with confused tourists, nor isolated in a corporate canyon.

The bad features - the bathroom plumbing was confusing, poorly designed and not user-friendly. The shower was probably the worst I've ever experienced in any hotel, anywhere. You must get in first, then turn on the water, which flows from hot to cold, backwards from any shower I've ever used. That means hot is the lower pressure. There's a metal pull-tab coming out of the wall to engage the shower head, which is tough to pull and kicked back to the faucet numerous times while taking a shower. Totally unacceptable, but the management should address the issue and I can only hope they fix it. Housekeeping was problematic and inconsistent, management got word and followed up. - The majority of the staff was excellent, with respect to their generosity and assistance when needed. - The location is great, near Grand Central, midtown conveniences - somewhat quiet at night depending on the rooftop bar action next door - generally a peaceful retreat. - Internet access is $15/day, worked seamlessly, but I think it's overpriced and should always be free to guests in any hotel. - The Perfect Pint next door was the best meal I had all week. The Amish Market down the street was perfect for me, I prefer quick, ready-made meals and snacks - all could be stored in the fridge all week. Big plus. I sense this hotel is best for business travelers, overall it worked very well for me except for the cockamamee plumbing.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood midtown location w/o midtown noise.\u201d", "Author": "guoning", "ReviewID": "UR64163367", "Content": "I stayed at The Alex a week for work.

There is also a good sized refrigerator. The bathroom has rain shower and a TV, agian a bit small. Now the thing I don't like about the hotel, the lobby is very small, it gets very crowded at times when there are people checking in and out and people waiting for restaurants. There are only two elevators, it gets slow in the morning when i try to leave for work. The furniture in the room are a bit worn, especially the small dinning table in my room.

He without doubt was the best sight for sore eyes! This man deserves a medal for putting up with us, and our daft questions, he made us laugh out loud each time we came and went from the hotel, and we were gutted each time he was not on duty. That's not to say the other staff were not friendly and helpful, because they were fantastic, all of them ( Carlos deserves a mention too) We had come, in part, to celebrate a big birthday, and my little sis had asked for a bottle of something nice for me. The Alex did me proud, thank you sooooooo much. The rooms are not the biggest in the world, and the view was not the best, but who cares? We were hardly in the room. and when we were we were more than comfortable, we loved the turn down service. We ate Sushi at Riingo for supper the 1st night, sitting outside in the warm evening,and Linda fell in love with the Shiraz, declaring it the best she'd ever tasted, and boy has she tasted some! Food was lovely, service great, but expensive. It was a bit of a relief when it poured down for the rest of our break, as we could not have afforded to eat there too often, and we would have been tempted if we'd seen diners outside on our way in or out! Next door, The Perfect Pint, offered us just that. The food was good too. Happy Hour was a special bonus. Along the way was the Amish Market, I want to shop there every day!! We tried a few places recommended by TA but by far the best was Scottys Diner. Go for Scottys Brunch if you're there over the week-end! If not, go there and ask Nora what she suggests. She is the best waitress in the whole world. It's a chance to eat breakfast like a local. Brilliant! Some more suggestions: Chinese at Chin Chins, Margheritas at Dallas BBQ ( really!!) Harlem Gospel brunch at B.B.Kings ( food not so good, but the \"show\" fabulous) P.J.Clarkes do great food, but be sure to tip twice the tax, or the waitress will let you, and anyone else in earshot ,know you did not tip enough ( nearly died from shame ha ha) - We had been told to try Smith and Wolenskys Grill, but the crowd in there were SO loud, we had to leave, but DO try. We did the downtown bus tour, and laughed all the way round, great fun, if you get a boring guide, get off and get on the next bus!

I had stayed at the hotel myself a few years ago, really liked it, and booked it for this trip after finding a very good deal on Expedia. For a total of 3 nights, we paid approximately $700, which includes all taxes and fees. First, the location of the hotel makes it a great base. It's very near the 6 subway line and to Grand Central Station. Second, the amenities are very nice. The toiletries are Fredick Fekkai, the sheets Frette, the robes Frette, the snack Dean & Deluca, and there are two TVs, one in the bedroom, one in the bathroom. Some posters have mentioned that the rooms are small. Well, maybe if you compare to a Midwest hotel room, but for New York, they are quite spacious. One thing that I have to mention is the hair dryer. I almost never trust the hotel hair dryer to be anything other than some teeny, tiny low-wattage thing. The hair dryer here is the same mega wattage that the one I have at home is. I liked the robes, slippers and hair dryers so much from my previous stay that I didn't feel the need to bring my own, which is very rare for me. I wanted to bring only a carry-on, so I was trying to save space. As for breakfast, I didn't eat at the hotel. On the same block as the hotel is a market called the Amish market, which stocks anything you might need for breakfast (there's a small buffet) or a carry out lunch. Very, very nice place. I would certainly stay at the Alex again. The windows block out most of the sound, but we did have an issue when some people near the hotel were trying to make \"music\" by pounding on tables and the bottoms of metal trash cans.

I had given the trip to my mum, so I wanted a hotel of higher standard. I have made plenty of good experience with hotels which are part of the \"leading hotels of the world\" group so when I found a nice offer from The Alex and kind of liked to pics, I went for it. Prior to the trip, the first \"hickup\" was that when I asked for what transfer options they had I received a really poorly drafted word document ... I was close to doubting the sender's sincerity! Shortly prior to the trip I received a very friendly email from the manager, telling us we had been upgraded to a suite - lovely of course - and asking for further wishes. Good start! Once there, however I was disappointed from the start. Checkin was far from smooth and rather businesslike, not too friendly. We disliked the interieur, but well, that's individual tastes... looked rather worn even though I do not think the hotel is very old. The suite had a \"fully equipped\" (well...) kitchenette, a sofa that looked as if it was cheapest plastic ever and a TV. The fridge was so loud that it was unbelievably annoying. The suite had a huge balcony with a view over the Chrysler building, of course, in summer that could be a real asset. Bathroom very small but okay, bedroom too. In-room safe unusable. However, the thing I disliked most was the service - eg we are checked in as two people, but the turn-down service persistently only but one pair of slippers and one bathing robe on the bed. It's just not first class. Light bulbs were broken, TV remotes did hardly work etc ... Also, both the service in the restaurant, where we had breakfast (which could be chosen a la carte up to a certain value and was okay, but not great) nor the front desk or other people were too forthcoming. Am used different from other LHW hotels. And when I asked for a cab to leave the airport, we were provided with a town car - not much more expensive than a cab, but driver went via I don't know which mini roads to avoid tolls ... in 5pm traffic.

Room service had a habit of taking things away but not replacing them: by the end of our stay most of the glasses had gone, and the bathrobes had disappeared. On three of the five nights, the kitchen garbage bin was emptied but no new liner inserted. And the final insult was to be overcharged by over $3100 due to a human error.

With a full kitchen, living room/dining room combo with a flat screen TV, a large bedroom with flat screen and a bathroom with TV (much more appropriate than a phone - never quite understood that one) - this place had it all. The Alex was perfectly located for us - close to Grand Central and lots of great bars and restaurants in walking distance, and after just two nights it was so hard for us to leave. We will be back, though, and will go through PerfectEscapes again. As a 'New Yorker' (my boyfriend is cringing), I always search for the deal to get the best for the best price, and they didn't do us wrong!

The bedroom and bathroom were quite small but we had plenty of room in the living/kitchen area and hwho needs a huge bedroom in NYC when you're out and about most of the time so this was not an issue in the slightest. The doormen were nice although not overly chatty/freindy as others have ecperienced although very professional. Maybe we didn't try hard enough to talk to them! The Irish bar right next door is really great with a good atmosphere and great food. Shows all sports that you could ever want to watch and is fairly reasonable. There is also a coffee shop called Macchiatos a couple of streets down towards Grand Central which did great coffee and hot croissants & bagels (amongst other more healthy options!) made to order at very reasonable prices, perfect for breakfast.

We didn't eat in the hotel but The Comfort Diner across the street does excellent food and we ate breakfast there most mornings. I checked out loads of hotels before I booked The Alex and I can absolutely say that I booked the best hotel, it is within easy walking distance to all the main attractions that New York has to offer ie, 10 minutes walk to Times Square, Empire State Building, 5th Avenue etc etc. We had a fabulous time and can't wait to return.

Large flat screen tv in which you could rent movies if you wanted a lazy night in. Bed was super comfortable. Loved having the refrigerator if only to store snacks for midnight munchies.

There were 3 other Irish pubs right in the area of the hotel. Not sure why so many!! Negative The back of the remote control in the bathroom was broken. Instead of fixing properly, it had black tape on it to hold the batteries in. Very cheap looking. Heating did NOT work properly. The heating had 2 settings - on at 75 degrees or off. 75 was too warm, even during the winter. When we asked to have it fixed someone came up to the room, they turned it off and opened the window. LOL. So basically, we slept with the windows open to get some air circulating in the room. We asked to have feather pillows swapped out for foam ones due to an allergy I have.

Front desk staff very helpful and friendly on arrival however check in time of 4pm being stuck too was disappointing. However, the stored bags fine and gave a number to phone after three to see if room was ready... We stayed in a one bedroom suite which was plenty room for a short trip to NYC. Bathroom was small and dark but clean, very functional and shower was great. All it probably needed was a few extra bright downlighters and white paint and we would never have noticed. The bedroom was a perfect size for a couple with 4 cases to fill and the plasma TV was fully sufficient with the 40 or so free US trash tv channels and news. The living area in the suite was the only small let down. It was a little shabby and just needed freshed up. On reflection, we probably did not need this space, however, may not have thought this if we have got a smaller cheaper room. Dont know how pokey these are!......The suite did have a full kitchen and fridge though. We never used the kitchen but fridge and freezer came in handy for our market bought refreshments and ice cream!!! One good thing about the suite was that we were on the 31st out of 33 floors. What a view and quieter up there !!. See photos we took from the room. Chrysler building right outside our bedroom window and we could be the manhattan water way from living room. Did not use the hotel gym so cannot say how good it was however the business centre (one room on third floor with PC's and printers) was very handy to use free internet plus also check in and print boarding passes when going home. The area this hotel was in really suited us given most sites, shops etc (Macy's, Grand Central, Chrysler, Times SQ, Central Park, Blooms, Empire) were are within walking distance. We had a great long weekend of weather and walked everywhere. We did not sample any of the hotel food/bar etc so cannot comment on this however there was so much close by it just did not matter. I would say we bumped into one of the room service staff in the lift one night and she did show us the dish, it looked fab and smelled excellent so all looked ok there. To sum up, expensive mid town location however to be expected. Location excellent, lobby at let down, very comfortable and plenty of services, may need a wee freshen up in places, all staff very helpfull. Would we go back ??

Thermostat completely hidden by a closet unit... impossible to see what temperature you were setting it at. Sticky floor at room entrance upon check-in... not well cleaned.

Quiet enough (although larger rooms facing front are noisier). Very good gym for a hotel this size. Lots of equipment and machines. Location is excellent if your business is on Madison avenue / Lex avenue... but so-so if anywhere else (although taxis were relatively easy to find) Room service expensive but incredibly quick (too quick... would have liked to get through my morning shower before the doorbell rang!).

My husband and I were traveling with our son who was 8 at the time, so we booked a 1 bedroom suite. We arrived at the hotel and were very pleasantly greeted by the outstanding doormen who very quickly unloaded our luggage and made sure we didn't have to do anything but make our way to the front desk. Which we did, only to be greeted by incredibly, enthusiastically friendly staff at the front desk. (It was a breath of fresh air after spending 3 and a half weeks in Italy where 'great' 5 star service doesn't even come close to that of the USA). We were given an upgrade to a 2 bedroom 2 bath suite plus breakfast thrown in. A very nice surprise. They told us where local restaurants and shops were located and offered to make a dinner reservation for us at any restaurant we would like. The staff were all very very friendly. All of the housekeeping staff to the elevator assistant, front desk, doormen and the Town-car drivers that the doormen organize. The front desk staff greeted us by name every time they saw us. They organized tickets for us at the last minute on a show that was sold out. The concierge was great and extremely helpful. As was Mel (Melanie??) at the front desk. Really lovely and always very friendly. The room was fantastic. The beds were incredibly comfortable. The main bathroom, located in the main bedroom, was large and very roomy (yes, the shower was tricky and cut out a couple of times mid rinsing hair, annoying, but you get over that, just turn it back on). The 2nd bathroom was smaller, and looked like the photos on the website as well as other reviewers photos. We never once ran out of towels as others complained about. In fact, we had 2 showers a day and still never got thru all the towels provided. We could see the Chrysler building from every window in the room (both bedrooms and the kitchen and living area). The room was certainly roomy enough for the 3 of us. I would not say it was \"sumptuous\" luxury, but it was modern luxury and very comfortable. If you are looking for a grand, stately hotel, this is not the place for you. But if you want a modern and sleek hotel with it's own personality and flare, this is a great place. It is comfortable, you don't feel like you have to 'wear a tie' to breakfast, but, due to the price tag, the hotel maintains a higher standard of clientele. Liked having the kitchen. We didn't cook of course, but we stocked up on fruit and snacks at the Amish Market down the street. It's a FANTASTIC gourmet deli. We actually shopped there a few times. We had a coffee maker/pot in our room from memory. Other reviewers complained of walls being paper thin, but we did not once hear our neighbors. One day we stopped back into our room at about 2pm to drop off shopping bags and to make a snack and I did hear a phone ringing and ringing. It was a little annoying so I walked out into the hallway to see if I could determine what room it was coming from and found it was actually the hallway/corridor house phone ringing. So, I just answered it. Turned out, it was housekeeping, looking for another housekeeping staff member whom she thought was on that floor. She was very apologetic and by the sound of her voice, absolutely mortified that a guest answered the phone. It stopped ringing after that. Others also complained that hotel staff, housekeeping etc use the elevators, which is true, but we found that if a staff member was waiting for the elevator and we walked up, they ALWAYS insisted that WE take the elevator and they would wait for the next round. They would not ride with us, as they didn't want to make us uncomfortable. A couple times though, we insisted they ride with us. We had breakfast at Ringo's daily. The first day for breakfast we had a waiter that was obviously having a bad day. He was very preoccupied and didn't give a rats about serving us. We were kind to him regardless, and the next day he was like a different person. Very very friendly, gave our son a hot chocolate (on the house, as it was not included in the free breakfast). I think he may have recognized that the day before he had been a little grumpy. He remembered what we ordered the day before and for the remainder of our stay we almost didn't have to give our orders, he remembered. One note though, we tried one morning to eat in the area outside. We could not do it, ended up moving back indoors. The sounds of New York are great, but not during breakfast. It was very noisy with the sound of traffic, horns, big trucks and also, NOT something you want to do when it is rubbish/trash collection day. The smell was a little overwhelming. The location is good, it is in a commercial area. The only better place to stay in terms of a 'nicer' location in our opinion is the upper east side which is more of an upmarket, quiet residential area. Alternatively, if you like a trendy, hip location, then Soho might be it. Great place. Would definitely stay there again.

After flying into Newark (would go to JFK next time as I have done previously - and if you can afford it, use US Helicopters to fly straight to Manhattan = awesome!), it was on the train and then a taxi to the Hotel Alex. Impressions were immediately excellent after being greeted with those wonderful words - \"Mr Moss, we have a beautiful upgrade for you\". I am nobody special and did not ask nor expect this, but it was very welcome. The staff were friendly and efficient, and to be honest, this was my experience throughout my 4 day stay. My room, a King suite was clean, huge and well appointed. No view but did I say it was big?! I had a kitchen area, lounge, bathroom and bedroom. Excellent beds and Frette linen, reasonably fast internet access (a must for me) but no wireless in the rooms themselves (there is in the lobby/lounge). I had an American breakfast thrown in as part of my deal and I had this on two occasions - very nice, seemed very fresh and one day I rocked up with minutes to spare and they accommodated me with a smile. Beyonce's entourage was also staying whilst I was there, so if they were there, then hey, who am I to complain?! Finally, I was granted a late check out with not too much hassle, and they booked a car for me to go to the airport. So, in review: - a stylish, cool and well appointed hotel - friendly staff who really were very helpful - top location - Grand Central in 5 minutes and another subway about 10 minutes away.

The bedrooms were almost too small for 2 adults to walk around at the same time. Bathroom tub constantly flooded and we ran out of towels every day. Frederic Frekkai products were a nice touch but not worth the extra money. Furniture was extremely modern and uncomfortable. The L-shaped \"couch\" in the living room was 2 small for my 2 boys to sit on and stretch out together on. It was low and felt like a bench with a pad on it. Room service was outrageously expensive - $221.00 for dinner for 2 adults and 2 kids. Some of the food was just terrible. We got chinese takeout a couple nights and stocked up on snacks and drinks at the nearby Duane store. The refridgerator in the kitchen was filled with \"mini bar\" items - $4.00 for a 10 oz. bottle of coke. Kitchen was sort of useless as it didn't have a coffee maker, or kettle...nice with the microwave though. Front desk and doorman were basically useless as well. They had no idea how to get ANYWHERE. It was very frustrating to say the least. They answered \"I don't know\" to almost every question. I had to get on my laptop to get directions to local attractions and restaurants. Not helpful at all. The front desk staff acted like a chatty bunch of high schoolers and would blatantly ingnore customers while they chatted about plans for the night, their ailments, etc. They all need to be retrained in \"service\" skills if they hope to make this hotel a top hotel. Out of all the hotels that you can choose from in the city - I would choose a Courtyard or Embassy Suites over this. Half the price and better, more functional, rooms. Housekeeping did not clean our room for 2 out of the 4 days that we were there. Were rude when we needed to request bedding and towels. All in all it was a very expensive disaster.

Even though we were there early they let us check in AND they upgraded us to a suite at no additional charge! We were thrilled. They offered to help us arrange dinner plans (we already had them) and provided us with a map of the NYC area, along with recommendations. Our room had an amazing view - we were on the 26th floor of the hotel and the snapshot of the Chrysler Building was taken from our bedroom. The living room afforded the same spectacular view, and we felt like we were living it up the entire time we were there! They even put little Starburst candies on the plates in the dining room - a funky but memorable touch. The bedroom was comfortable and we had a flat-screen television in our room. The bathroom was so clean, which makes me very happy when I'm in a hotel! It also had a smaller flat-screen television, which was great to have on while I was getting ready. There was another flat screen television in our living room - a very high tech room! The hotel is conveniently located near so many attractions - we walked to St. Patrick's Cathedral, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, and the Empire State Building in our afternoon. It goes without saying that, at the holidays, one MUST stop by and see Rockefeller Center - it was absolutely magical! Cabs were in abundance, obviously, and we never had a problem getting one to go to dinner, the bars, or up to Central Park. I only wish we'd had more than one day there. Also, as an aside - if you're in NYC for a romantic weekend, I'd highly recommend dinner at Tavern on the Green. It costs an arm and a leg, but my boyfriend and I went there and had the most wonderful time. The food was quite good (which was a pleasant surprise, since I'd heard it was mediocre) and I've never experienced a more romantic environment.

Since we couldn't check in until 4PM, they held our bags and we were told that our bags would be in our room after 4. We came back to the Alex around 5, stopped in the bar for a drink and encountered our first problem with the service. They had run out of the house wine and refused to open another bottle..we were told we could buy a full bottle of something else, but we could not order a glass of house wine. The waitress was very sweet and managed to get them to serve a substitute wine. The second problem was that our luggage had never been sent to our room and we had to wait 20 minutes more for our bags after they had been sitting around all day. We had to rush to get ready and this almost made us late for our dinner reservation. As we left for the evening, the doorman led us to a waiting car which took us uptown 40 blocks to the tune of $50. This was our own fault for not asking but the hotel was certainly not looking out for us as they really steered us to this \"service\". The final blow came upon checkout when we had to lug our bags to our car because no one was around to help us. Was it all worth it? Well, if you only are looking for good quality sheets, comfortable beds, cool electronics and good shower products then this is the hotel for you! It's small, has an attitude, and fell very short on service. I would not recommend this hotel.", "Date": "November 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cA little pricey, but very pleasant\u201d", "Author": "snowbunnyUK", "ReviewID": "UR6025662", "Content": "I was really happy with the studio room, and the staff were very friendly.

The Alex is none of these. It is at best a 3-4 star hotel in a 2-3 star neigborhood , with not much going on. The hotel itself was fine, the rooms were more than adequate for NYC. The suite was large and very quiet. The best part of my stay was the size of the 1BR suite with the living room and bedroom being seperate. A great set up for someone travelling with a child or teenager. I never heard the NYC street noise or the tv from the LR. I would agree with one other review in that the hotel is not set up for business travel. There is no wireless in the rooms (absurd in 2006) so you have to go to the small lobby. Lights were not adequate to do work and 2 bulbs were out. Not set up for business. Not a magazine in sight either. I loved the kithcen with full size frig, ice maker and stove. No coffee maker but I called housekeeping and they brought one right up. Beds were to die for. AC did not cool the rooms enough. The hotel staff seemed self indulgent at times , but overall ok. Not very helpful so I was glad to be familiar with the city. On a positive, they were able to honor my late check out time which was very helpful. Sam, the doorman was the nicest guy -5 stars for him! The front desk said they were careful about security but I passed through the lobby and upstairs without any ?'s at all times. I was hoping they would ask for my key as I had a teenage daughter with me and wanted tighter security. Anyone could go up the elevators. Overall a good choice for location and room size. Would I stay here again, maybe. It is a hotel trying to be hip but has long way to go for the prices they charge. If you can get a 1 BR suite for under $350, go for it. Forget the regular rooms.

However, NO checkers. So, we called the front desk to inquire about where to find them...and (here's the weird part)...

No, the checkers were not made of gold...they were just plain old checkers. Weird.

Some would say this is quite sad - surely I should be out enjoying my last night in the Big Apple. If I thought it possible, I would. Now, as this is a hotel review, I'll start with that first. The Alex Hotel is located just off 3rd Avenue on East 45th Street, about 10 minutes walk from Grand Central Station. An ideal location for exploring Manhattan. However, the hotel has failed to live up to my expectations. Ever since arriving, I've been made to feel like a second-class guest. Placed on one of the lower floors at the front of the hotel, I experience all the noise and bustle of 45th street, including noise from the office block opposite the hotel which has a shredding lorry pick up their paper - at 1am every morning - and shred their paper!! You would think that this is a common occurence and an apology would be forthcoming - hah!, you should be so lucky. The room itself is OK, but lacks certain things that a business man in NY needs - like a desk. All the furniture is modular and \"trendy\", meaning that there is no real space to work. In addition, the wallpaper is peeling off the wall and the furniture is stained with God knows what. Finally, the price of food and drink at the hotel is a disgrace. A beer costs $9 (\u00a36) and a two course meal with water set me back $90 (\u00a360).

Muarry Hill area and 2nd Avenue have some great restaurants and bars. O'Neil's, just around the corner on 3rd Ave. is a great typical NYC Irish bar, the big screen comes down for sports events, food is good and reasonably priced, the crowd is local, friendly, and very outgoing, the barmen are all Irish. - As stated in earlier reviews, The Alex truly does have some of the best Doormen in NYC. Very friendly, very helpful, funny, and willing to go out of their way to help you. I've stayed at many of the top hotels in NYC, these guys really are the best. I don't know why, but tthey are. - Liberal upgrade policy. It is not unusal to get upgraded to a one or two bedroom suite (more about those below). - Beds are quite comfortable, clean high quality linens. The rooms are clean, good amenities in the bathrooms. In the suites, the kitchens are fantastic, high quality full size refridgerators and oven/stoves, microwave, dishes etc. The Bad; - The reception always leaves something to be desired. There are only two stations, and if it is at all busy the waits can be tiresome. As stated in earlier reviews, unlike the Doormen, the reception staff can have a bit of an attitude, and often leave you feeling like you have been processed rather than welcomed. - The hotel bar. This is obviously a very subjective area. I find it to be cold, sterile, and uncomfortable. - The rooms are generally spacious, and well appointed, butr the choice of furniture is not very comfortable. The suites have plasma screens in the living room, bedroom, and bathroom, but the only really comfortable place to watch is from bed. The rooms have DVD and CD players as well, and all good quality. They did not scrimp as on amenities, everything is excellent quality, it is more a question of design and choice. The Awful: - There is no service elevator, so in the mornings you are competing with guests, housekeeping, and room service for the 3 elevators. Often houskeeping will lock one of them off, making waits even longer. I once had to wait ten minutes for an elevator (only once, but still...) - The room temprature. Previous reviewers are correct. This is a major issue. - Room service is overpriced even for room service, and not very good. - Internet access can be an issue (this may have been corrected). All in all, not a bad place to stay, you take the good with the bad. For myself, I prefer to stay at The W Court, a few blocks down at 37th and Lexington. More expensive, but more my kind of place.

He showed us all the ins and outs of the suite and how to use everything. He was extremely nice and helpful and provided us with great service from the first moment we arrived. The suite was extremely spacious, especially for NYC. The bed linens were absolutely fantastic. The hotel provided a nightly turn down service that was a nice touch as well. The bath products were Frederic Fekkai and were also very nice. The kitchen was great although we didnt use much of it. It was fully equipped with silverware and cuisinart cookware. Again, Klawson was great, he gave us a few recommendations on eating and various other things. He turned us on to an Omish Market just down the street that was great for snacks, hand tossed made while you wait pizzas etc. He went out of his way to make our stay enjoyable. He remembered our name every time he saw us and spoke each time. There were several others who were very good as well, Chris and Alberto (I think). All these guys worked very hard and you could tell that just by watching and speaking to them. I must say, our last night there, Klawson knocks at the door and was bringing us a vase with some fresh flowers in it. Nothing we asked for, just following up on the great service. Our suite had a great view of the East River and Queens on one side and we could see the Chrysler Building out the other side. I can't say enough about how nice we were treated and what a nice experience we had during our stay there. As to the other reviews complaining about various things: I think in alot of cases some are just looking for something to complain about. The toilet is not difficult to flush, you do have to push a button to flush and it is not loose, but it is not bad at all. Now, I can only comment on the room temp. during our stay, and it was fine. There were 2 thermostats, one in the bedroom and one in the living area. We like to have it as cold as it will get, and while it wasn't as cold as many we have stayed in, it was in the mid 60's our entire stay....more than comfortable enough. You do have to re-pull the shower switch once or twice during your shower, but big deal! I suppose it is their way to try and save water. Certainly nothing to complain about.

Don\u2019t panic if you have already booked, it gets four stars because of some minor points, I couldn\u2019t give it five stars, though I would have liked to. We chose this hotel from TripAdvisor reviews as the best 4 star hotel we could afford, and got a reasonable deal on expedia. (Last time I stayed in the Milton Plaza near Times Sq and I vowed never again, it was horrible and far too busy.) Location is great, a good trade-off between city buzz versus noise. If you are fit you can walk everywhere, closest subway is nearby at Grand Central, with another line at 51st St and Lexington. 45th was a one-way street, with parked cars both sides and only one lane free for traffic, so quieter than the avenues. It was a weekend though, traffic noise was slightly worse on the Monday. We took earplugs just in case, but didn\u2019t use them, I was so tired I was out like a light anyway though my partner wasn\u2019t so lucky. Reception was always courteous and welcoming, there always seemed to be plenty of suited guys nearby the desk to assist and we never had a problem waiting for the lifts. The doormen always ran over to push-start the revolving door and asked if they could get us a cab. Unfortunately we got a room which faced over the back, so no Chrysler building view for us. In fact you could see a partial view from the hallway windows (yes, daylight and a view in the hotel corridor!!) I did go back down to ask if we could change, firstly to a view of the Chrysler building and if that wasn\u2019t possible, then to a room higher up on the front, but although the receptionist was friendly and receptive about my request, she did say we were on the highest floor for our room type (10th floor, normal room not suite) and my partner thought she was hoping we would pay for an upgrade to a suite. The room was smaller than we anticipated, on the floor plan we seemed to have the narrowest room on the floor, (room 1002) but as a bonus we were at the end of the corridor, so only one set of neighbours. The photos on the website are accurate, although as I said, we had a much narrower room (only about 18 inches clearance at the end of the bed when cupboards were open) Also our room was longer than everyone else\u2019s inside as the bathroom wall jutted back out into the hallway instead of taking floor space out of the main room. Having said that, the bathroom was quite small (but perfectly adequate) I had to take my photo standing inside the bath! The bath is not real limestone, it is a normal bath with a nice limestone tile surround, ditto the sink. Also if you wanted to watch TV from the bath, you would have to look sideways and halfway up the wall, it isn\u2019t right at the end of the bath like I imagined!! It is a lovely touch though, quite easy to see from the shower, and we enjoyed having it there. The bed linen was crisp and white and the room was spotlessly clean when we arrived. Our bed was kingsize and lovely and comfortable. The carpet looked brand new and was still slightly \u2018spongy\u2019 underfoot from the underlay, lovely and soft on barefeet. The cupboards, TV, curtains and sofa-couch thing were exactly as pictured on the websites. Didn't eat from the minibar or snack tray so can't comment. We had plenty of fresh towels, with robes and slippers, however my robe was supplied clean but badly frayed, and I should probably have asked for a new one! The toiletries were classier looking than I\u2019ve seen in other hotels, but who is Frederic Fekkai anyway? Didn\u2019t use the shampoo and conditioner but face soap, body wash and lotion were fine. So, why only four stars? Well, along with the tatty robe, there was a coat hook (at least I think it was that) just hanging off the wall, and one of the light fixtures at the bed had two screws missing so that it kind of hung down. Our room windows were absolutely filthy (not that we had anything to look at) and one of the stick-on pictures on the wardrobe was peeling off. All of which would be easy to fix, but spoiled the room slightly. Also, a couple of things were annoying and the result of bad planning: the light switch couldn\u2019t be reached easily from the bed, and the alarm clock was smart but useless, it had a black display on black. It had a button to illuminate the display, but how do you find it in the dark in an unfamiliar hotel room? The temperature control for the heat/a.c. was in a two inch gap down the side of the wardrobe, impossible to reach, but luckily the temp was fine. Our bin was inside a cupboard and was not emptied on the third day, so we had old rubbish and juice staring at us when we were watching TV, another thing we perhaps should have phoned reception for (we were just too darn tired!!) The hotel looks great, with stone effect tiles on floor and walls, but has no sound-deadening furnishings or carpets in the hallways and we heard people come and go all night. I have no idea why people can\u2019t move around quietly in a hotel, instead of leaving doors open and shouting to their friend down the hall. Although this is not the hotel\u2019s fault, it is likely you will experience some hallway noise while you stay there, just from people coming and going. My partner had to stick his head out and complain to the room across the hall as they seemed to be having a party in the hallway. Also, the TV has a super woofer speaker thing, and it seems to boom out even when you turn the volume low. We had thought the soundproofing between rooms was fine, but then realised we must have had no neighbour the first night, and I don\u2019t think their TV was even that loud! Also, when I asked the concierge Flo if she knew of a \u201cClinique bonus\u201d (free skincare stuff, for all you gents) she insisted it was in Bloomingdales, even though I said I had already checked there and it wasn\u2018t. The reason for her certainty became apparent when she gave me a card with her name on it \u201cto get an exclusive discount for Alex hotel guests\u201c but obviously also earned her something for referral. Her discount would have been nice, but I would have been annoyed if I had made a special trip. Later I found the bonus in Macy\u2019s, perhaps Flo doesn\u2018t get a reward there. If they don\u2019t pay attention to the little things in a few years this nice hotel might get shabby, but for now we felt it was still worth our money as any complaints were only minor and we didn\u2018t take them up at reception, our loss.

The lobby was a bit on the small side. The room was nice, clean, seemed on the small side for a 700 sq ft one bedroom suite. Kitchen was immaculate-very clean. The bathroom was the same. In fact the whole room was very clean. Orhcid on table was a nice touch. Towels were not Frette as advertised but Anichini - still nice. The amenities were great-Fredik Ferkai. The TV sets were awesome. On the down side - The room was very warm. we could not adjust the heat for anything. The next morining we asked to have it fixed - we were asked if we wanted a fan. I politely told the man-no- I wanted to be able to adjust the room temp. When we arrived back late afternoon. THe room windows were open and the curtians tied around the lamps. This is not 4 star service. The refridgerator with mini bar items never got cool. The woman working as the concierge was always too busy and always answering the phone when she was servicing other customers. I found that the only way to get her was to call from the room. Unfortunate, because she seemed good at her job. But it is rude to answer the phone when she has a guest in her presence. They should provide additional assistance. The maids in the hallways were always pleasant,smiled and greeted us and made eye contact. When I wanted to have the car brought around I was told that I would have to wait a half hour. Or if I preferred I could walk around the corner and get it. When I went around to get it, they would not release the car to me. They called the hotel and they were informed no. When I went back to the hotel, they said that the parking attendant said I wanted to check out. This was not true as I was standing there when the parking valet called the hotel. He never said I wanted to check out. \"Heath\" curtly told me I could now go and get it. This is not 4 star service, I asked him to have it brought around. The two men at the front desk were not friendly at all. They did not smile, except when laughing and joking with other staff members. Overall this left me with a bad impression.

I travel to New York on business and the company I work for has a corporate rate there. I have become quite familiar with the Alex, given the fact that I check-in and check-out every week. So, here's what I think of this \"great\" and \"terrible\" (previous reviewer's comments) hotel: - the good: it's a clean hotel, I believe it's only a year or so old, and the rooms feel pretty new - the bad: apparently, they're still working on their service - one reviewer said that the staff was \"indifferent\" - I'd say the majority of them are snobby and some of them down-right rude - their attitude seems to be, \"we're a high-class boutique hotel and you're just a lowly traveler - you should be thanking us for letting you stay here\" (yes, that's probably exaggerated, but as most of you will find, not terribly so) - the good: rainfall shower (note: i do not call this a \"good\" feature of the hotel, but apparently, everyone else enjoys a rainfall shower) - the bad: interesting shower to operate. first, you have to hold out the little knob below the big on/off knob. then you have to turn the water on while continuing to hold the little knob. all good and fine - i usually turn it on from the outside, adjust the temperature and then step in (sometimes difficult as the bathrooms can be quite cramped and you can get your arm wet). the PROBLEM being the shower is set on some sort of timer (if you read the hotel's note, it has an automatic shut-off to help conserve water). to alleviate the shock of the water suddenly shutting off, stick one of the soap bars between the wall and the edge of the knob - this keeps the steady pressure so that it won't pop back in - the good: they have a flat-screen TV in the bathroom, a flat-screen TV in front of your bed (for a deluxe room, two if you have a corner deluxe room - rooms ending in -07 below the 10th floor, two if you have a one-bedroom), a DVD player and a stereo system - the bad: these great gadgets don't necessarily work. the big flat-screen in front of your bed is of fuzzy-quality and sometimes the sound won't come on - same for the stereo. if you are deeply concerned about your quality-tv time, make sure to turn everything on and off and flip a few channels to ensure that they are operating correctly and call the front desk immediatly to remedy if they are not working properly - this may turn into consistent pestering as they may not be interested at that particular moment to care for your needs - the good: your own thermostat - the bad: also may not operate correctly, follow the above procedures for the tv and stereo - the good: their 24-hour fitness center and business center, you just need to swipe your card-key. the fitness center has the regular fan-fare - treadmill, elliptical, recline bike-machines, weights and some weight machines, as well as the big exercise balls - the bad: if you are having a really bad day and end up with a room on the third floor - these rooms are very noisy as you can hear all the traffic passing on 45th as well as the other guests utilizing the business center and the fitness center Conclusion: the hotel still has that new and clean feeling, but it's starting to show signs of use/age because some of the walls and ceilings have stains or peelage. for a weekend, all the bads from above may be tolerable, but i personally feel the regular prices are intolerable, unless you are able to book through one of the discount websites.", "Date": "July 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winter Park, Florida", "Title": "\u201cComfortable hotel - Friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "Car0lynP", "ReviewID": "UR3511555", "Content": "We just got back from our four day stay at the Alex. The studio suite we had was very nice with little extras like robes, slippers, comfy bed linens and nice quality TV. We did not have much use for the kitchen area (except the fridge), but it was nice to have nonetheless. Kudos to the concierge for figuring out the restaurant we wanted from just a description of the food and general location because we forgot the name/address. And, double kudos to the IT guy who figured out how to get the internet working on my husband's lap top. Sorry I can't remember your names but if you were working on May 27th (IT guy) and 29th (concierge), you know who you are. Staff was all very friendly. Door men always greeted us with a smile and got us cabs very quickly. The gals who cleaned our room (we were on the 30th floor), were very friendly and did a great job. We'd come back to the room in the afternoon and it would be clean. We'd come back late at night and the bed was turned down and slippers and robes ready to go. Avoid the mini bar and room service unless you enjoy outrageous prices. (industry standard, but I just can't stand it getting ripped off with the so-called \"convenience fee\") There are some markets in the area, so grab some soda, water, etc and stick it in the fridge if you have one in the room you choose. We were concerned about a few of the reviews about problems with hot water. The water was hot in the morning and evening at the times we used it, so I guess they worked that problem out. One issue that was a bit annoying was the elevator. I am sure the staff/management is aware of the problem. Lets just say we consistently ended up waiting a long time for an elevator with bell hops, etc. running back and forth in front of us. Somewhat chaotic at times. For this reason, I cannot give the hotel an excellent rating. I have experienced this at other NYC hotels, but it is an inconvenience just the same. Oh yeah, check out the deli around the corner called Pinnacle, they have great lox & bagels and the guys behind the counter were friendly.

Although the lobby's a bit small and the check-in desk can be crowded, the rooms are surprisingly large by NYC standards -- we had two full-sized beds and a chaise, and still didn't feel crowded. The decor is very well done -- natural colors (beiges, browns and cream tones), the beds super comfortable with pillowtop mattresses and down duvets. 2 flat-screen TVs, minibar, robes and slippers -- Frederik Fekkai toiletries. Drawer space was a little limited - lots of little drawers but few large. All in all, very relaxing! We had drinks in the restaurant bar off the lobby (Riingo) but didn't get a chance to eat there. Housekeeping was responsive and quick - we asked for extra shampoo and it was there in 10 minutes, delivered with a smile. Room service was very quick (30 minutes max) and nicely presented -- the menu's a little limited, but what they have is excellent. Prices were typical for room service -- although breakfast prices weren't as high as I've seen in similar quality hotels. Great location, close to Grand Central and a few blocks away from the Lexington Ave subway line. If you're looking to grab cheap snacks or drinks, there's a deli next door on the corner of 45th & 3rd, and a gourmet grocery store across the street with prepared foods as well.

After check in, I decided to take a shower but had to call the front desk since after about ten minutes I couldn't figure out how to work the shower. TV was a nice touch. Considering that it was a new hotel I was surprised to see cracks in the tile, paint on the floor, and faucet knob in the shower falling off. Safe wasn't working, we had to call service and he was very prompt and efficient in fixing it. Our suite included a martini package which wasn't there we we arrived so we had to call front desk and it was delivered that night. Studio suite was on the smaller side then expected. Linens were very clean and comfortable; however bed was very short - I am 5\"6 and my feet were hanging off. Also our room was just outside the elevator and we could hear every conversation going on outside. Be aware of the hidden charges on the room service menu - my husband's $7 cookies and milk truned out to be an outrageous $14 after room service charge, tax and tip. The view of Chrysler building was neat, way better if you are on the upper floors.
