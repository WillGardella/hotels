It was tremendously spacious, and not just by midtown standards. It was truly the most finely appointed hotel room I've ever stayed. The impressive photos on the website do not exaggerate; in fact I don't think they do it justice in terms of overall scale. No street noise from our room. Staff was very friendly, personable and helpful. Parking is a piece of cake and surprisingly not as expensive as expected. I would describe the decor as rich and opulent, but still understated. It fits in very well with the local surroundings/atmosphere. There is no place like New York, and in New York, there is no place like the Mansfield.

We were in the city with others from our University to celebrate Social Work Day at the United Nations. The Mansfield is a small boutique hotel with all the charm of the Art Deco movement. We each had our own rooms, which were small but clean and allowed plenty of space for 1 person. We each got a very good rate from one of the discount booking site which made it as affordable as anything we could locally in the Chicago area. It was about 1/3 the price that some of our other friends were paying at other hotels and only about $20 more than those who booked over in New Jersey. Location: The hotel was centrally located just 2 blocks from Times Square and Grand Central Station, making it an easy walk to most things. Comfort: The bed was comfortable, with both feather and down pillows. The bathroom was small and the lighting very poor for putting on make-up. Air conditioning is window air, but was okay with me because I have that in my bedroom at home. Food/Services: The hotel offers room service, but it is quite expensive. As is the food and drinks down in the M Bar. (i.e., yogurt/granola and fruit = $12; coffee $5). A martini will run $16.00 and a glass of wine is $12. While I didn't take advantage of the free coffee in the library, I so enjoyed the welcoming aroma each time we entered the hotel. We did find other places nearby that were more reasonable, but overall, New York is very expensive by Midwest standards. Staff: Concierge Robert was very helpful. Someone is always available to help with bags or hail a cab, which are generally plentiful except after shows let out or it's raining. Overall, I have given the hotel a \"very good\" rating because it more than adequately met my travel needs for my purposes in being in the city. If you are looking for posh and elegant surroundings then this is probably not the place for you. But, if you are looking for a nice place within walking distance of the theatre district or shopping opportunities, then I would say this is a great value.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAmazing experience at the Mansfield\u201d", "Author": "Lorraine H", "ReviewID": "UR126783458", "Content": "Just returned from a girls weekend at the Mansfield Hotel.

At this price point The Mansfield is as good as it gets in NYC. My experience is all of the 44th Street hotels are at about this caliber. A competitor in this price range with larger but not nicer rooms would be The Dylan. I have never had a problem with this place---you'll need to pay over $500US a night to get into a larger room in midtown. One plus for The Mansfield is that the interior (small) rooms look out into a light shaft - no view but quiet. You will appreciate this at 3am on trash night in NYC where the constant beeping and loading noise from trash trucks working the street below have kept me awake more nights than I'd care to remember. I think this place is perfect for business travelers as it is in the heart of midtown and will not raise eyebrows on the expense report. For tourists be forewarned that if you booked one of the cheaper rooms its going to be small. Fine for a night but it could be an issue if you go for a week. That said it is not a major tourist or convention hotel which I am sure is a plus for some.

Staff was very welcoming and supportive, helped us change rooms when we found traces of smoke in our room, and were very courteous during our stay. The rooms were not as advertised - in our case we had rooms that were rundown and looked like they desperately needed another refurbishment. The shades would not close properly and we slept in glaring lights of office rooms of the opposite building. There was a lot of noise from what was probably a heater or air flow mechanism from another building as well. Everything looked rundown and the shaving mirror in the bathroom was kaput. We thought the hotel was more or less like this - the other reviews show that at least some rooms are still up to standards. A more personal problem is that we did not really like the lights in the rooms and in the hotel in general - it seems to be a design issue to make reading more difficult and to turn pushing the buttons in the elevator into a guessing game. But symbolic for our stay: this was the case in one elevator, whereas the other had sufficient lightning! I would recommend checking your room before accepting it and looking at the shades in particular, as well as the general state of the room. Noise is always available in generous quantities in New York, so that should probably not be a deciding factor. Location is great - very central, just a short walk from Grand Central and from Time Square.

When I asked if it was possible to get a tooth-brush, an iron and board and per chance, a shoe shine kit- I was cursed at in Italian and hung up on. I was later informed by the Front Desk that I should have called Housekeeping for such items (which aside from the iron and board were not available). However upon informing them of the inappropriate telephone 'etiquette' of their Room Service staff, the Concierge seemed quite unmoved and not at all apologetic.

The first night was absolutely horrible. The room was extremely tiny, but that was not what bothered us. The A/C was not working at all! Although we called the reception a couple of times throughout the night, the handy-man that came up could not fix it, though he said he did. We practically stayed up until the morning, and once it was 6AM, went down to the reception desk to complain once again, ready to switch hotels to the Sofitel across the street! Although we were partially frozen by then, the gentleman at the reception desk was helpful and kind. He said he did not have the authority, but that he would pass the information onto his manager, and make sure we switch rooms. They upgraded us to one of the better rooms in the Hotel, called 'The Jennings Room', which was a very roomy suite with a working A/C an impressive decor. We stayed there for the other two nights; it did not make us forget the misery of the first night, but surely left a better taste in our mouth about the management of the hotel. Overall, the location was very convenient; it was a quiet street in the vibrant heart of midtown Manhattan. Close to shopping, entertainment, and sight-seeing; also had access to Metro easily. One bitter part was that the lobby seating did not exist at all; once we made the reservation we saw these cute pictures of a reading room/library-looking lobby; though it was under construction throughout our stay...

Would recommend for someone who hasn't stayed here before, but would probably stay somewhere else on my next trip. Recently stayed at The Mainsfield for a holiday weekend in NYC. Location is the biggest selling point of this hotel being only very short walks to Grand Central, Bryant Park and Times Square. Decided on the Mansfield as a change from one of the larger chain hotels and to take advantage of 3rd night free promotion. The Mansfield is smaller boutique hotel that has been renovated from an older, architectural beauty. This is where the give and take comes in. Having been restored from it's rich history, the hotel's size is dictated by the original rooms and layouts. It is smaller than most hotels in both lobby and rooms, but and effort has been made to preserve some of the charm of the original. If you are hunting for maximum square feet and an expansive bathroom, look elsewhere. If you are in NYC to see the city and will appreciate some architectural character this will work nicely. Pros -Great location for sightseeing - Easy walking to Grand Central, Times Square, Bryan Park & 5th Ave. -Renovated - hotel has undergone renovation with more modern style rooms, beds, fixtures, ipod clocks, etc. -Free wifi (although not lightning speed - speed tested at between 1-2MB down) -Free cappucino & coffee in lobby -Architectural charm -Nice lounge & M bar -Helpful housekeeping staff -Beds are solid -Street has nice charm and upscale feel Cons -Front desk staff seems indifferent most of the time -Rooms are much smaller than most hotel chains (but remember it is a renovation of an older building, rather than dozing it down and building new) -Bathrooms are exceptionally small (Rm. 902) - minimal counter space, small shower, etc. -No luggage racks -No table for eating or reading -AC units in windows (allows some sound in from the street - but you are in NYC!) -Beds are on rollers so move around a bit unexpectedly. -Plasma tv on wall is way to small. -Wifi a little slow, but free.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Haifa, Israel", "Title": "\u201cwonderfull\u201d", "Author": "evi z", "ReviewID": "UR121311587", "Content": "we were two friends sharing a room, as we arrived we were offered an upgrade and the room was ready for us as early as 10:00am. the room was great, clean, quiet, convenient for us. the hotel stuff were helpfull ,very patient and pleasent, made it possible for us to make a late checkout on the checkout day. the location is superb, we couldn't ask for more..defenetly a hotel to go back to", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa", "Title": "\u201cMansfield in New York, Tiny, but great\u201d", "Author": "chucker999", "ReviewID": "UR121196337", "Content": "Just got back from a five day NY vacation.

I was leery based on other iffy reviews but, having stayed here many years ago, I wanted to see for myself how fair these criticisms were. The hotel is scaled from a different time: narrower hallways, smaller elevator, smaller rooms. But there's marble and ironwork and hex tile flooring, and overall a feeling of architectural charm absent from many other NYC hotels. The room was immaculate. Nicely appointed, with a sleek modern vibe. Fabulous sheets and bedding. The bed itself was fantastic. Clearly management has spent money since the last time I was here. This includes upgraded lighting: the room had nice bright halogens over the window box (great place for luggage) and bright spots for bed reading. I asked for a quiet room, and got one. The bathroom was a little underlit and also tiny -- the sink, practically something from a sailboat -- but the shower (no tub) was spacious, with fabulous water pressure, gorgeous tile, and bright lighting. Thick, fantastic, white towels, replenished daily. No funky smells or scents. Didn't use the TV, so can't comment, but it's a newer flat screen mounted on the opposite wall from the bed. Housekeeping: fantastic. Front desk staff ranged from good to excellent. I witnessed one incident where the clerk showed an uncommon level of patience to a very, very trying customer. It exceeded what I'd expect in a psychiatric nurse, and reminded me how very hard their jobs can be. The restaurant is comfy; ate only breakfast there. Asked for simple toast and fruit (not on the rather elaborate menu) and was accommodated graciously. The only serious gripe: wifi essentially was useless. I was able to limp along with a 3G iPad, but anyone who absolutely has to have a reliable wifi - computer connection would be advised either to ask for a room with a stronger signal, or look elsewhere. But as others have said, the location is unbelievable and, especially with any promotions the hotel is running, the place is a great value. Saved at least $500 over the next choice.

The closet contains a safe and a minibar- boxes of candy were $4, bottles of beer were $8, wine $20. Great location on 44th, near many of the Broadway theaters.

Also, looking at some of the other reviews, I would like to point out that if you are staying in a mid-town boutique hotel, you are porbably not the same kind of person who takes the airport shuttle and who is worried about an extra $8. I would recommend that if you even consider the airport shuttle or the bus into the city, you would be happier at a hotel like The New Yorker. The Mansfield is very close to 5th Avenue.

From the minute we stepped out of our cab with incredibly heavy suitcases and the concierge came out, grabbed our bags, brought them to the front, then offered us both bottled water, I knew we would be happy with the service. The concierge then gave us a brief tour of our room and showed us where all the hotel facilities were. The room itself was larger than I expected (Parlour King), given that we were in Manhattan. It wasn't huge, but again, we were in Manhattan. The bed was almost too comfortable--we never wanted to get up in the morning!! The M Bar was beautiful. It wasn't overdone with crazy trendy decor, but was timelessly decorated. Free espresso and/or tea at any time of the day was also a wonderful touch. We also had free breakfast in the M Bar--also delicious. I do have two complaints. 1. During our last two nights, we woke up sweating even though our AC was set at 60 degrees. Neither my boyfriend nor myself are abnormal sweaters, so it was clear that the AC was not properly working! Both times we had to completely turn off the AC and restart it. Not something we enjoyed doing considering we were woken up in the middle of the night. I don't think is indicative of the service or quality of the hotel, just something that disrupted our nice stay. 2. Although I loved this hotel, I do want to warn anybody that relies on having internet when they travel to either avoid this hotel or practice their patience. The internet speed was terrible. There were two Mansfield connections. One had two bars and one had three bars from our room. We tried them both and literally waited 5-10 minutes to load websites. One time, we left our room for the day while a page was loading, came back hours later, and it never loaded. We asked the front desk if there were better connection options and he just said that they had two connections. So again, do not stay here if you need the internet. It's unfortunate that such a wonderful hotel has this horrible flaw.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "fort wayne", "Title": "\u201cCharming, great service, international flavor, small bathrooms\u201d", "Author": "sawtom", "ReviewID": "UR116486510", "Content": "Stayed with family 5 nights at this hotel.

Fortunately, the bedroom is located in the back of the suite, so it's nice and quiet, particularly if you close the beautiful glass doors that separate the two rooms.

We stayed three nights over a long weekend. The hotel is \"old\" New York. Lots of dark wood and marble. Tiny elevators. We stayed in a \"Club Row\" suite on the second floor, and frequently took a very narrow staircase from the lobby to our floor. It was like having a quaint secret passage to get in and out of the place. The folks at the front desk were very accomodating. We had some magnetic key issues that they had to doggedly pursue to get fixed. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They even hooked us up with umbrellas when the weather turned biblically rainy. The room had hardwood floors and smelled a little strongly of lacquer or varnish. We gave a little thought to getting moved, but we seemed to get used to the smell after a while and stayed put. The room was nicely appointed and of decent size for NYC. The bedroom was separated by beautiful frosted cut-glass doors --- a cool touch. The bed was very comfortable. There was a flat screen in both the bedroom and living area, but when will these hotels start to deliver an HD picture? It makes no sense to have a nice TV and a crappy low-def picture. The heat came from a radiator and boy did it work. The thermostat remote didn't do anything. The windows do open and we'd crack one occasionally to moderate the temperature. The view was unfortunately pretty ugly out the windows. It looked into a courtyard to nowhere and we were essentially staring at brick walls. It made the room very, very dark, even in the middle of the day. The bathroom is tiny. Great showerhead and solid water pressure. The toilet was crammed next to two walls and neither my wife, who is 5'2\", or myself (6'4\") could actually sit normally on it. We sort of had to ride it side-saddle. We had more than a few laughs, but the engineering was pretty lame. The property is in a phenomenal location,a bout two blocks from Times Square. However, it's just far enough away that the street outside is quiet at night. Our package included breakfast, served in the hotel bar, and it was pretty decent every morning. The bar is very turn-of-the-century and a pretty neat place to have a drink. There is also an old-fashioned walnut-lined library on the property that's a great place to sit and read the paper or have a cup of coffee. It's a quirky hotel that is probably not for everyone, but for the money ($233/night) it was competitive and a little more fun than staying at a newer hotel.

It was a \"Gentlemen's Rooming House\" in it's hayday, a century ago. It is a rare treat to be able to stay in a building like this, with it's interesting staircase and hardwood floors. The beautiful library and 24 hour coffee service is a delight. It was a nice touch, and much appreciated, to be handed a bottle of water upon check-in. The bedding was of a nice quality and it was changed everyday (many hotels are now cutting corners on this service). The room was clean and adequate, but there is no place for coats or dresses, as the closet is only half length due to the (un-needed) minibar. A couple of hooks on the wall would be a very welcome and inexpensive addition. My only other complaint is that the lighting in the room was extremely inadequate. Again, this would seem to be an easy and inexpensive fix. There are lamps, which provide direct lighting, but there is no indirect lighting, which gives the room a depressing and \"cheap\" feel. It appears that they probably paid big bucks for a professional designer to pull everything together. I always think it would be a great idea for a designer of a space to actually live in it for a night or two, to get a perspective. If that were the case, there would probably be much better lighting in the room. The staff seem professional, but unlike most NY Hotels I have stayed, they do not acknowledge guests with the niceties of \"Good Mornings\" or \"Welcome Back\". As I write this, it seems a bit petty on my part, but it was something I noticed at the time. I think \"detached\" is the word I would use. Be prepared to hoist your baggage up the 4 or 5 steps at the front entrace, as the doorman is not always there (to be fair, they are hard-working and are usually helping other guests to their rooms). I think it may just be a shortage of help.

The trip itself was expensive but we expected this given the location i.e. New York, Manhattan specifically. The staff on the front desk were very polite and helpful, but the same couldn't be said for some of the staff who served in the breakfast room who were less than polite. The rooms were quite spacious considering I was expecting small rooms. The only downside was the airconditioning unit in the room which was directly attached to the outside wall so let in the smells (chips mainly) and noises from outside. My room had no view and all I could see was an industrial generator underneath my window. As a result my room was noisy and a little smelly at times. The TV in the room was large and had plenty of channels on it for watching late at night. The room was very clean and was services excellently everyday. The bathroom was also clean and had a lot of space with provisions such as shower gel etc. The cost of the rooms came with a complimentary breakfast (vouchers were handed to us upon check-in) - however breakfast was really poor and not at all filling. You were given a choice of food and one drink only anything else was charged and no variations were allowed without charge. I asked for a little dollop of yoghurt to go with some fruit .. I was charged $2 for the privilege! Luckily there were plenty of diners nearby that one could go to for a decent authentic New York diner experience. When we discovered the diners we totally dispensed with bothering with the breakfast. On the lower floor the hotel has a gym, small but adequate, and two PC's for FREE internet access which was wonderful ... (in this day and age internet use in hotels should be free - especially wi-fi). Overall the hotel felt very boutique and cosy with a drawing room for guests to sit and read newspapers in front of a real log fire which was a nice touch. The location is excellent and a few minutes walk away from all the major attractions - Broadway, Fifth Avenue, Times Square etc. I would definately use the Mansfield hotel again - an enjoyable experience.", "Date": "October 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cThe best hotel value I have ever experienced in New York City.\u201d", "Author": "MichaelAGoldberg", "ReviewID": "UR81973886", "Content": "The Mansfield is a wonderful surprise.

It was my second time in NY and my wife's first and we decided to book this hotel rather than a chain hotel as we fancied something off the beaten track... Upon arrival we walked into the lovely reception area, very quirkey and clean and I was impressed, however having to bring in 2 large suitcases on my own as my wife is six months pregnant did not impress me. Check in was swift and efficiant and the receptionist was polite and pleasent. We were shown up to our rooms by the porter. Once we got in the rooms we could see what people meant by the fact the rooms are dark, the main light really is useless! But that said its a minimum of effort to turn on a spot light which lights up the room totally. The room was quite small but the whole point of our trip was to see the sights and get out so that was no issue at all. The bathroom is not big but by no means small, I found it perfect for us and always clean. The only issue I felt was storage, there were no drawers so my wife was living out of a suitcase (it doesn't bother me!) The housekeeper was brilliant throughout the week and our room was always clean and topped up with soap etc. She is the only reason they got one star for service. We popped out and when we came back I wanted a map for the next day, I went to reception as the concierge was not manned and had to wait while the receptionist chatted to a colleague who was clearly leaving after work before I was spoken to, but I got my map. The following morning I made use of the gym, it is small and basic but as long as your targets are C.V then it's fine and well maintained, the C.V stuff has TV's on them to listen to any of the hotels channels. On the third day however it had run out of towels and the water bottle was empty by 8 am, I left it for 30 mins before asking the receptionist to sort it out, they did so within 20 minutes. However when I asked for this the male receptionist was quite blunt and rude, not what I'm used in the U.S. The night before we were leaving I needed to arrange our pick up in the morning, I spoke to the concierge when we got back and he said it was no problem and to get our pick up voucher, bring it down and he could help me. I did this straight away and was back down within 2 minutes, he directed me to the other concierge member on the desk as he was now talking to someone, the other staff member looked at me like I was insulting him and told me to speak to the male receptionist who would sort it. So I went over to him and again asked for some help, however he also looked at me like I was insulting him and whilst still looking at me called out to one of the girls and shouted could she come over here to deal with this as he was due off half an hour ago and wanted to go home. The girl receptionist then came over and had no idea what I was asking help for, so she dialled a number and thrust the phone into my hand. thankfully the lady on the phone was brilliant and helped me loads, but this left me very disappointed with the staff. We had a drink in he bar that night, nice buzz for the after work crowd but dies after that and it really is not cheap! The next day when we checked out I was in the rest room when the transfer bus arrived and 3 members of staff stood by watching my six months pregnant wife struggle trying to take the suitcases to the bus, not one moved to help her. Thankfully I came out prior to her hurting herself. All in all the location is perfect, easy reach of most things, Times Square, 5th Av, Empire state building etc and for a boutique hotel it looks great.

But on my arrival the reception noticed that it was my birthday the next day... they upgraded me to a Queen (they wanted to give me a King but it would have been another hour to prepare), and I think just about every member of staff wished me happy birthday over the next few hours!! Very nice touch. The building has a real old New York charm. They have managed to retain the original features and a real feel of a genuine experience.. whilst adding modern twists and modern standards of luxury. The stairwells and corridors themselves are beautiful as they are full of character... not often I feel compelled to include stairwells in a review! Room was on the small side but definitely not shockingly so, and there was plenty of room to move about.. All very well appointed and lovely furniture. The bed... I can't say enough.. it was very very comfortable. Loads of power points. Air con was efficient but as per other reviewers it was pretty noisy. I wore ear plugs at night so that I could keep it on. It was very hot the weekend I was there. Lighting was muted to say the least. Not good for the application of make up! Bathroom was small but well laid out and luxuriously presented with a big shower. Aveda products are lovely touch. There is a well appointed gym with well maintained equipment (2 running machines, bike, cross trainer, plenty of freeweights and a stretch/abs area on a mezzanine level. This is a really good facility which you might not normally get in a non-chain hotel so I was pretty impressed. There is also a business centre - just 2 pc's but internet is free and printing is free and on demand (no need to request at reception). The other nice touch is the club room where you can get a free coffee (from machine) at any time of day. This is a library setting and feels very relaxing. Location is second to none and I would definitely stay there again. 1 minute from 5th Avenue and the M1 bus heading downtown. 3 minutes from Broadway and Times Square. 5 minutes from the Rockefeller centre and the cathedral. 10 minutes walk from Hells Kitchen and some lovely bars and restaurants (try the Marseille). 44th street is relatively quiet for a crosstown street in this part of New York. Plenty of good dining/drinking options right on the doorstep, including the historic literary Alonquin hotel. I had a couple of fab cocktails there. Felt very refined! Well, I am worth it!

Trip started a little bit on a downer as my sister and her daughter's flight was screwed up (Air Tran loves to over-book) but definitely took a positive turn when my daughter and I arrived at our chosen hotel-The Mansfield. Since I have limited words I will sum it up by saying that this hotel is charming, clean, has beautifully decorated rooms with the 'feel' of NY, has a fantastic location-close to Times Square/5th Ave/possible to walk to Central park/near Grand Central/NY Public library/Bryant park etc etc. Helpful and friendly staff (Henry!~Edward~cleaning woman who was sweet when we interrupted her by coming back to the room unexpectedly~curly haired woman at desk) they upgraded our room due to the flight mess which we appreciated VERY much. I recall seeing a few reviews here before booking that said staff was not friendly...I can only imagine that these reviewers are not terribly friendly themselves~you get what you give! In fact, we met so many friendly, funny, helpful and interesting people~LOVE NYC!!! And will definitely book at this hotel on return trips. And did I mention...FREE (and actually good) specialty coffee that you can get for yourself any time in the charming library. Sadly didn't get the chance to sample the blueberry martini in the M bar due to our quest to cover all of Manhattan in 5 days...but, bar was quaint and peaceful...next time! Also must be said that the beds were extremely comfortable, the Aveda bath products appreciated and amazingly our room (a suite on the 12th floor) was so restful, cool and quiet! This is NY-honk honk. For anyone who hasn't been to NY you should be reminded that the rooms over all are not large...but, bigger is not always better. Our suite had everything we needed and despite our bathroom fitting 1 at a time we managed beautifully.

We were also looking for a smaller quiet hotel so we could relax in the evenings. We would like you to know we have found the gem of the city. THE MANSFIELD HOTEL 12 WEST 44TH NYC. The hotel is in an excellent position just 2 blocks from Times Square. It\u2019s so close to everything you want to see but also just far enough away to be quiet and relaxing. A factor we were amazed about is what you see on their website is what you get; there are no glossy misleading pictures. All the rooms are just perfect. Upon arrival you immediately get the welcoming smile from each and every staff member at that remains the same to the day you depart. The door staff and concierge were exceptionally helpful and friendly throughout and the reception staff was Excellent. The boss of reception was Henry McLauren and if nothing is too much to ask. The rooms as you will see are in fantastic condition and are exactly what you see on the website. They don\u2019t hide the fact this is a boutique Hotel and the rooms are smaller than others but everything you need is in there. The rooms have A/C and a safe and the bathrooms are fantastic. All fitted out to a high modern standard and very clean. Admittedly being a smaller hotel consisting of 12 floors it does not have fantastic views from the rooms however any traveller going to see NYC will know you need to get out and about to see the city so this is in no way a disadvantage. The hotel has the full range of amenities available to you with a fantastic fully equipped Gym, Free internet access , Fantastic menu , Room service , Excellent selection of drinks at the bar , Fantastic Staff , The bar at night is lovely and relaxed and drinks are very reasonable pricing. I will have uploaded pictures of all levels of rooms from the smaller Chamber Queens through to the Penthouse and you will be able to see the fantastic standards are consistent throughout. I was informed that there are seasonal price variations and that like all New York Hotels shopping around for your price is recommended. We used a company called Magellan Vacations and they were also excellent. Do your shopping around then go to them we paid $149.25 per night plus the usual taxes and fees. This made the hotel very affordable and EXCELLENT value for money. I will include pictures of various rooms and did enquire about the pricing of the Penthouse as it was amazing the price again was dependant on season and was from $800 - $1200 per night. If you are going for a very special event (Honeymoon etc) don\u2019t miss this you will love it. All in All in this has been the best hotel we have found in NYC, Highly recommended and we will be staying there again. Please feel free to email me in relation to any information you may need as I am more than willing to help you. Or email the manager his name is John David Agosto (-----) once again a very helpful & positive person, guess that\u2019s where the staff at The Mansfield get it from.

I arrived and was instantly greeted , upgraded to a king size room, and given vouchers for free breakfast every morning. The room is small, but there was plenty of room to walk around, the bed was comfortable, and I loved the hard wood floors. I am a bit technically challenged so the a member of the mainteance team arrived within minutes of calling to show me how to work the A/C and A/C remote. Now to the wonderful customer service. The team at reception and housekeeping were so prompt with my request for ice, places to eat around the hotel, and any questions I had while I was there. However, the best moment was at checkout. Sunday morning (6/13/10), I was leaving at 4am to catch my flight. Unfortunately, the Puerto Rican parade was that day and started in front of the hotel so the street was blocked off. The hotel had notified the guest the prior day to let us know. Gina, at reception, said she would take care of me. She called me at taxi to pick me up at the corner of 5th & 44th. I was a bit nervous to walk to the corner by myself since it was 4am, I'm 3 1/2 months pregnant, and my traveling bags in tow would be a sure sign that I was an easy target for anyone. Gina assured me that even though it was a very safe neighborhood, she would personally walk me to my taxi so I would feel comfortable. WOW - she was wonderful.

He said all the bigger rooms are reserved so there is nothing he can do and he gave us one room which we entered and ran back immediately. It was tiny tiny with no light and a horrible air ventilation noise. The same guy who couldnt do anything suddenly could do something when we started claiming and gave us a bigger room!!?? I dont like this kind of approach which to get something you need to claim and cry etc. since it doesnt happen when you decently and logically request. Anyway the final room was ok. However I should mention that air ventilation was still noisy and the lighting of the room is very bad. Also the 24 hour free wi fi which was one of our attractions for the hotel was not working properly and when it worked it really only worked in the toilet (no kidding). There was 24 hours complimentary coffee tea which was nice. Location is very good. The bar and the staff in the bar was very nice. Front desk was never even saying hello good morning good bye nothing except for one lady whom I saw only in the last day. Housekeeping was very good room was always very clean and taken care of.

We stayed in a chambre petite room, which was essentially fine, as we did not intend on staying in the room very much, which we didn't, however, when we did, it was a bit of a tight squeeze with 2 suitcases and after a days' shopping, we were struggling to make our way around the bed. The room comprised of a very comfortable double bed, a single wardrobe of which most of the space was taken up by the mini bar fridge and the safe. The safe was far too high for me to reach and it was difficult to check it was empty when we left even for my 6ft husband. The room also had a lovely window seat, but being only 5 floors up, we looked out to nothing but other rooms, so the blinds remained permanantely closed! Shame really. The bathroom, on the other hand was huge with a walk-in double shower and Aveda products to boot. Another hook to hang stuff on would've been useful, particularly as there were two people in the room. The room was generally clean, but the floor was in need of a good clean as there were a good few inches of dust at the edges. The hotel also had a very convenient library, which of course housed books and a chess board, but more importantly, it provided complimentary tea and coffee (tea drinkers who have milk like me need to request milk from the M Bar). There was an intermittent wifi connection for the hotel, although there were computers available for your use. There was also a gym in the hotel, but we never used it nor looked in. The M Bar was on site, adjacent to reception, but we only wnet in to get milk for tea! Staff were acconmadating and polite enough when we needed assistance. On departure, we had to vacate the room at midday, but our flight was not till the evening, so we were able to leave our luggage in a safe room whilst we continued exploring NYC. The hotel is conveniently placed, being 2 blocks from Times Square and a few blocks from Grand Central Station. There's a good Italian restaurant next door and breakfast can be found everywhere!

The hotel is virtually opposite the Sofitel. I\u2019d purposely booked 2 rooms as I knew how small the rooms in these boutique hotels can be. We were not offered any upgrades, I made the booking via the hotel. We had rooms at each end of the 8th floor, away from the lifts so no \u201cpinging\u201d noise to annoy us! Initially the rooms seemed fine, although both were incredibly hot with small radiators on full blast, despite the temperature being around 16c when we arrived. Fortunately we managed to turn them off completely and the windows opened. My room was the smallest, with a toilet and shower cubicle in the tiniest of bathrooms! Too small for a sink which was outside and in the bedroom itself. The saloon type doors did close but had a gap down the middle and any taller than me and your knees wouldn\u2019t fit inside the little bathroom itself! Fine for me on my own but not if you like privacy! My husband\u2019s bathroom was bigger with a bath and shower combined. The rooms are very dark, with lots of dark wood but there are blinds you can open and plenty of lights. It was very clean and we both found the beds and bedding to be extremely comfortable. The temperature dropped to around freezing during our 4 days but I still didn\u2019t need the radiator on! Nice flat screen tv and free WIFI which my husband used. There wasn\u2019t much noise, apart from one night when I could hear people coming back at around 12.30am and they slammed their doors! This was repeated at around 3.45am in the room next to mine! We also noted that we could smell cigarette smoke in some parts of the corridors, we had asked for a non-smoking floor so maybe the smoke was drifting from other floors (the staircases are open leading to each floor) or we were on the smoking floor. Once inside our rooms we couldn\u2019t smell anything, which was our main priority. There was some street noise in my room but it didn\u2019t bother me, my husband\u2019s room was quieter. We had an excellent meal one evening in the Hotel\u2019s bar, good, friendly, efficient service and a nice menu. We also had breakfast which was ok, but nothing special and the bar in the daytime was rather depressing with so much dark wood and dim lighting. We made use of the complimentary tea/coffee machine which is available in the \u201creading room\u201d, unfortunately it constantly ran out of coffee and milk and the staff were in no rush to refill it! We also noticed that the hotel was very dusty! Many of the surfaces in the reading room were covered in dust and the computers and desk area were dusty enough to write messages on! We got a hotel car to Newark Airport rather than a yellow taxi. This was very comfortable journey in a SUV with a good driver. Overall, the hotel was fine for 4 nights but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d stay there again, despite it\u2019s good location.

Check in went smoothly (although the front desk staff seemed very bored to be there and was not overly friendly)-we arrived at 14:30 and were allowed to go to our room straight away. I had booked a Parlour Queen as I had read on tripadvisor that the rooms were tiny. I booked directly on the Mansfield website and got 3 nights for the price of 2. The Parlour Queen was also very small but it was big enough for my boyfriend and I to keep our bags on seperate sides of the bed and not bump into each other when packing. The bathroom was fairly big (no bathtub) with a giant shower which always had plenty of hot water and good water pressure. The biggest downside about the room wasn't the size at all but that there was no ceiling light so it was quite difficult to get the room well lit on entering the room at night as we had to turn on all the lights-dim lighting is pretty but not very practical so it would have been nice to have the choice. The bed was very comfortable and the room was impecably clean. The room seemed a bit too warm at times and we weren't quite sure how to sort out the heating but opeing the window for a bit sorted it out fairly quickly considering how cold outside! There was no view-just the back of another building but we really didn't mind at all since we saw so much when we were outside the hotel. There was a flatscreen tv on the wall opposite the bed and I was delighted with the docking station for iPods as I didn't have an adapter for my iPhone charger with me.

We had arrived mid morning having first checked that we could store our luggage at the hotel and return after official check in time and no problems there. We returned later in the day to officially check in, were handed our room key and told our luggage would be brought up shortly. The lifts were very small and a bit creaky and dim but we made it to the 7th floor which was equally creaky and dimly lit. When we opened the bedroom door we thought they had actually given us the key to the broom cupboard as it was such a small room but, hey, we only planned to wash and sleep there and they say size is not important! Our cases arrived shortly after and we managed to squeeze them in somehow. The room was clean but again a bit dim even with the light on. The bathroom was 'compact' but functional and came with the added bonus that you could slide the bathroom door back and with only one step you were in bed! The single window faced a brick wall housing one of the largest air conditioning ducts we'd ever seen and it turned out this 'hummed' all night long making for a very disturbed nights sleep. Next morning we debated wether to ask for a change of room as it was only for one more night but decided as were in for a very long day/night and journey home tomorrow a goods night sleep was required. The receptionist agreed to move us without any qualms and said if we left our luggage ready in the room it would be relocated for us. When we returned around 6ish for a wash and brush up we had been moved to a room a couple of floors up at the front of the hotel facing the street-our forlorn looking luggage was waiting for us as promised. This room was similar to the first one but a little bigger and although there was a little traffic noise at least no continuous noise to keep us awake later, erm, well at least that's what we thought........... About 3am that morning it sounded like there was a dust cart convention going on in the street below, lorries backing up with reversing beepers, clanging metal, engine noise. This went on for hours so again sleep was only possible in fits and starts. Maybe we were just unlucky with our room allocations and of course some noise is to be expected in NYC but having said that we had previously stayed at another hotel facing right on to Lexington Avenue and didn't encounter any excessive noise. The hotel does have a certain old world charm about it, the staff members we encountered were all friendly and helpful and it is handily located for getting about and seeing the sights but even if the City never sleeps occasionally it's visitors need to so we probably would not stay here again unless a quiet room was guaranteed! .", "Date": "September 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "essex, england", "Title": "\u201clayback, in the heart of new york city\u201d", "Author": "milly75uk", "ReviewID": "UR38841257", "Content": "This hotel was lovely, everyone friendly and helpful.

Staff From the moment I got out of the cab in the rain, to the moment that I got in another cab (my sole cabs btw on the trip; I strongly prefer walking/subway/busses) I could not say enough things positive things about the staff. First, they were professional. They were always very friendly and made The Mansfield feel like a home away from home. If they did not remember me by name, the certainly remembered me as a guest. The great thing was this attitude held true from the front desk staff, waitresses in the restaurant even the housekeeper on my floor. Great general manger. Keep it up. Grade A+. Location I used to stay around the park during trips to New York, but for years have moved toward mid town location. Happy made switch, as don\u2019t think for business traveler, anything beats mid-town if need to get around to multiple locations during the trip due to subway access near both Times Square and Grand Central. The Mansfield and its owners certainly are not alone in enjoying the location, as there are perhaps 7-8 hotels on 44th between 5th and 6th. It worked out great. Location A+. Room I was able to get upgraded at check in to a small suite. I enjoyed it. The good outweighs the bad, but I\u2019ll offer both comments. Good points are the room was nicely paneled, larger than most, had two flat screens TV and generally was quite. The bad was that it was much to dark for my liking as was an interior room on light courtyard and did not have accessible temperature controls without calling the engineer. Grade B- Ammenties I\u2019m still amazed in how hotels create their value proposition. In hotels like The Peninsula and Ritz Carleton and others at the upper end many amenities are extra. It seems like the better the hotel the more they feel confident charging for everything. At the lower end every amenity comes with the room. What was terrific about The Mansfield was that it offered a boutique luxury experience and included all amenities in the price. There is a terrific fitness center, better than lots of much bigger hotels, free Wi-Fi, a 24 hour complimentary espresso bar (terrific), a great lobby/library, a nice lounge off the lobby, I believe complimentary breakfast (was for me). Loved them all and used them all. Grade A+ Value Value is the word of the moment and The Mansfield offered tremendous value. It\u2019s not necessary to elaborate, but it would be easy to spend 2 to three times as much for a room in New York and not have as good an experience. Grade A+++ Summary I completely and thoroughly enjoyed The Mansfield. Would stay there again in a minute and probably will again soon.", "Date": "May 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Freehold, NJ", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay for Our Great Price\u201d", "Author": "black325", "ReviewID": "UR29425385", "Content": "We received a rate of $159/night through Travelzoo and thought we got a great hotel for a great deal.

The area between the bottom of the bed and the bathroom was tight - only one person could pass through. The bathroom was adequate and nicely tiled. My only complaint with the room was that the lone mirror was in the bathroom - nothing in the sleeping area. Since the weather was in the 60s we did not need either the a/c or heat, so we slept comfortably. We had an inside room, and the only noise we could hear was the ocassional closing of our neighbor's door. When the coffee machine broke down, they put out carafes of coffee, decaf & hot water for tea. I was puzzled by some reviewers mention of a continental breakfast - we didn't see anything like that - only the paid breakfast in the dining room. We opted for the diner right down the street.

I'm pleased to report that I found none of the above. We were there during the holiday season and 44th St. in this area had a lot of holiday charm with several other boutique hotels and clubs on the street all done up for Christmas. We booked our stay through travelocity and got a huge discount on the rooms (ordinarily $500+, we got for $300+). The location itself is worth it., just off the corner of 5th Ave. and 44th St. As others have commented it was a very easy walk to all of the main destinations (Eg. 5 mins to Times Square, 10 mins to Central Park) There were always cabs available and the subway was less than 5 mins walk away. We arrived early (9am) and were amazed that we were able to check into our rooms and were invited to partake in the free breakfast. (juice, tea, coffee, fresh fruit, pastries, toast & bagels). Both the desk clerk and doorman were helpful and cheerful. Our room was plenty spacious, considering we only planned to use it to sleep. (who goes to NYC to hang out in their hotel room) It was very modern with comtemporary decor, a flat screen tv, Ipod docking station and newly remodled bathroom. The bed and linens were very comfortable and we had a lovely little window seat. It was also spotless. If someone were to ask me to be critical, I found the room a little dark since there was no overhead lighting. The closet was small and there was no dresser. The floors looked pretty, but as they were hardwood, they were a little chilly in the morning. Also, the bathroom door does not have a lock. The elevators were also on the small side. That being said, none of those things were enought to take away from the overall charm and ambiance of staying in an old-world boutique hotel right in downtown NYC. Perhaps if I had paid full price I would have been less impressed. However, on a weekend, three weeks before Christmas you don't expect to get world for a bargain. In particular, I enjoyed the library. I loved the high ceilings and beautiful crown moldings. I sat in the comphy leather club chairs by the fire and wrote my letters home. We also enjoyed a drink (bit overpriced) at the 'M bar' before heading out to the theater. When asked the staff was happy to recommend a sushi restaurant within walking distance. I'd also like to comment that although I didn't use these services, I was happy to read that they were available. They acknowledge that their gym is basic and offer entrance to local gyms if guests wish. They also over an extrememly impressive number of pet friendly services (including transporting your pet from point A to B without you). In response to another users review, we too did encounter housekeeping staff in the elevators and notice the housekeeping cart in the hall, but there really isn't another option. This isn't a holiday inn by the freeway...it's a classic old building, consider it part of the charm!

Check-in & Reception: Staff were welcoming, and check-in was smooth and efficient. I was offered a complimentary bottle of water on arrival. I went up to my room to find that my room keys would not work. I had to travel back down to inform the reception that my card reader was faulty. They subsequently called the engineer who was rather intimidating as he checked that I was \"able\" to figure out how to use the room key correctly. In actual fact, the battery in the card reader needed replacing, so was told to return an hour later (this was at 23.30, and was already quite tired from my journey!!). I then spent my time in the hotel bar, where I felt the staff should have offered me a complimentary coffee or snack whist I waited for them to fix the defective card reader, but was not. Room: The room was larger than I had expected; I had ordered the small room, and given that rooms in New York tend to be small anyway, I was pleasantly surprised. I was not disappointed with the decor; it was contemporary; with tones of mocha and cream. The bathroom was relatively large and well stocked with Aveda products. Despite the pleasing aesthetics of my room, there were a couple of annoyances. My room faced the rear court-yard, so not a great view, but I had expected that. More troubling however was the constant noise from the air conditioning unit (which continued even when I switched it off) which made it hard to sleep on the first night. I however had got used to it by the next night. Also the main parts of the room were clean, however noticed some traces of dust on the skirting and on the ledge of the wardrobe. Dining: Breakfast at the hotel was fabulous; There was a lovely ambience, with background light jazz music playing. There was a limited range of foods (bagels, muffins, fresh fruit juice, toast, cereals, yoghurt coffee etc) however it certainly hit the spot, and staff were very quick to replenish items. A great place to sit back, people watch or read the newspaper over breakfast. If you are a solo traveller, it is really easy to chat to fellow hotel guests as this hotel does not have the feel of the larger hotel chains. Location: Really central location, walkable to Grand Central station and Times Sq. The metro is a short walk away. Concerns: Apart from the initial problem with getting into my room (defective card reader), I had a really pleasant stay. I did not want to stay in a large/chain hotel which is very samey (i.e. you could be in any country in the world and not be able to tell until you stepped outside), but this hotel had a lovely ambience, and being a solo traveller wanted a centrally located hotel. In addition, it is really easy to chat to fellow hotel guests at breakfast due to the nature of the lay out of foods and seating etc. Other: The free WiFi is a bonus.

The room was a decent size (we'd heard NYC hotel rooms are notoriously small) and very nicely appointed. The shower was much bigger than many hotels we've stayed at. The location was awesome - close to Time Square, but not too close to be bothered by noise or traffic. The hotel itself is very quaint. The elevators are European-hotel small, but not unbearable. The free coffee/hot chocolate in the library was a pleasant surprise. It was a nice way to relax after tiring days of sightseeing. The only negative was the noise that came from rain on our window air conditioning unit. It took a while to figure out what the noise was and I guess we were able to tune it out and get a decent night's sleep. Thank goodness it only rained one night.

The fittings were very stylish and there was complimentary wifi which was a bonus. The staff were industrious and attentive, and complimentary continental breakfast was a very nice surprise. The room was very dark, and at at the back of the building so you could hear everything going on in the near by buildings, especially the jackhammer which started up at 8am - but that was not the hotel's fault.

The rooms provide no insulation from the road noise (I know this is NYC but I don't expect to pay $300 and it sound like i am sleeping in the middle of the road when I need to be in the office at 7am).

Location: Couldn't ask for a better location, as it is a couple blocks from Times Square and just off 5th avenue. It's close enough to the madness but located on a fairly quiet street ensuring peace when trying to sleep. Easily walkable to the touristy places in midtown and a short subway ride to the more interesting places in NYC. Staff: They were great. Anything we asked of them was quickly done and they were very pleasant. The bar staff was great as well. Hotel/Room: Lobby, bar and library were very nice. Felt like a very upscale hotel but the attitude of the service was down to earth and friendly. Stayed in the petite chambre room which was very nice but also very small. This was our first time in NYC so I imagine the tiny rooms are the norm. The room size, although small, wasn't uncomfortable or claustrophobic at all. The bed was pretty good and the pillows were great. There was a clock/radio with ipod hookup which was nice. The TV's were Dell brand with great picture and sound. Small closet and fairly small bathroom, but big enough to fit our needs. We had a view of nothing which was good and bad. we looked into the alleyway and it was fairly dark at all hours of the day. As a result, the room was very dark in the morning (which I like) and it was also very quiet due to the location. Front rooms may not be quite as quiet, nor as dark, but would have a decent view of the street. Bar: The bar was great, but pretty expensive. $15 martinis and $7 beers seemed a bit expensive, but NYC is an expensive city. Overall we were very happy with our stay and when we visit NYC again we plan on staying at the Mansfield. We paid ~170 per night which we felt was a good deal in comparison to other similarly priced NYC hotels we looked at.

We also had free bottles of fresh water in our room every day. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and helped us to sort out a car for our return journey back to the airport. The laundry staff were also really nice. We stayed in the Petite Chambre which was more than suitable for our needs as we only used it to sleep in. It was kept clean by the laundry staff every day. The location of the hotel, just down the road from Times Square, was spot on. We were central for everything, to catching The Metro to go Down Town or hopping on the open top bus tour (which is a must to see Down Town and Up Town). Another 'must do' is to go on a helicopter ride. It is an experience well worth doing as you see New York from a totally differnt perspective, which is truly amazing. Central Park was about 20 minutes walk up the road and was brilliant. We could have spent days in there. On our of days there, we heard Sheryl Crow practising in concert for that night, so went back later in the evening and joined in with other people in the Park that hadn't got tickets, but could hear her so clear. It was brilliant and unexpected. We also saw the Naked Cowboy on the last day in Times Square, which made my day. I wouldn't want to take young children to New York as it is a very busy city, nobody seems to sleep and the roads are quite manic (but you do get use to crossing the roads eventually).", "Date": "June 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oldham UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Pardytours", "ReviewID": "UR17132390", "Content": "Had a great 5 Night stay in New York after booking on expedia.

Really good things about The Mansfield Hotel: the location is terrific - midtown between the theatres and grand central station the buffet breakfast is an immensely relaxed and casual affair (no need for whispered conversations as in some pricey hotels) and it's lovely sitting by the window reading the paper and eating the hotel's elicious pastries, watching the world go by. There's a really cool 'library' with open log fire where you can relax after the theatre The rooms are clean and the service is excellent - caring but not intrusive. It was at the Mansfield that I learned of the generosity of New Yorkers. Really naff things about The Mansfield Hotel: The smallest rooms are incredibly small and the black and beige decor makes them feel even smaller. Also, I was told that none of the hotel's wardrobes can hold a full length garment. Most don't even have a coat hook. The air-conditioning can be noisy.

We booked two rooms , and they were $600 per room per night. Here is what we got & didn't get. They 'upgraded' both my husband and I and our two children to suites next to one another. Ok. Nice. Then we get to the rooms. These also looked nice. Small . But, clean, urban, boutique-hotel-ish. Our heat never worked. We called. We called. The engineer came. Still didn't work. The bathroom is stupid in design. You actually cannot wash your face or lean into the sink--we kept hitting our head on the shelf above it. It was like some silly TV sitcom happening over and over again. There was always, trash and dirty towels and maids carts in the halls. Look up at the ceiling in the hall, and there are wires everywhere, just hanging down, or jammed thoughtlessly between plasterboard facades. The paint was roughshod. The water was never hot. The windows were drafty and still had the little A/C units in the windows. No closet.---Actually, the bathroom, that was the size of a closet, with loose french doors that never closed properly. We asked for duvets for the bed..since it was quite chilly with no heat.-- Oh, and these rooms attempt to be so cutting-edge that there are only sheets and a strip of material at the bottom of the bed. We got these ugly pilly, beige blankets that you might hand out in a college dorm or government facility. The breakfast, which was included, was in the bar, very dark. They offered little boxes of cereal, some apples and oranges, instant coffee and tea bags.... I felt as if I had booked a Holiday-Inn Express breakfast. We ate breakfast around the corner . The Mansfield is certainly not a hotel for $600 per night. The flatscreen TV's were nice. The front desk was polite. BUT This is not a four-star hotel. This is a three star that someone bought, slapped a coat of paint on, bought cheap brown and beige furniture and tried to make it look chic. My husband is from Manhattan and we travel here all the time. Although we have stayed at the Mandarin, The Plaza, Athenee.. we weren't expecting a five -star this time.

The hallway was being redecorated and it was sanded, taped, and plastered, but never worked on during our stay. Luckily, the paint smell did not emanate our room. The room was a matchbox- but after my first trip to NYC I discovered that space is at a minimum absolutely everywhere. Accommodations were well appointed, if small, and the room had just about everything I would need for a short stay. Don\u2019t intend to unpack much, as there are only 2 drawers and a half dozen hangers in the closet. The light in the room was pretty bad. It made it difficult to get ready in the evening and the hair dryer in the room was palm-sized. The flat-screen tv was wonderful and the bed was super comfy. Full length mirror was a nice touch. And the complimentary bath products were Aveda, which I appreciated. At our request an iron and board were brought to our room.

The rooms are clean enough but drab, small and dark with inadequate lighting and little home comforts or extras like cushions, throws, pictures, mirrors - a little too basic.

It was the first time my sister-in-law (from Australia) has been to New York. We wanted to be central and all our favourite hotels were booked. We had the 2 bdrm suite (PH5) which I think had been renovated. The beds were incredibly comfortable and the lighting was well-thought out but the renovation was a bit wacky - the hand- held shower was a challenge in the narrow bathroom and there is a huge - at least 6 ft long -TV in the sitting room that is too big for the space. The biggest problem was the squealing and roaring sleep preventing noise from a heating and cooling system on a nearby building. It was constant day & night and was so loud it actually drowned out the sounds of the early morning renovations. It was NOT garbage trucks as one person at the desk tried to tell me. Eventually a longtime employee admitted it was from a nearby building -something about they should ask their neighbours to replace the ballbearings in their system -but nobody really seemed to care. Lots of times when you stay in downtown European cities you can be in an area that is very noisy but the room is quiet due to double or triple glazing on the windows. I suggested to the staff they invest in something like that. Why expect guests to just tolerate it? My husband and I and my sister-in-law all have high pressure jobs and needed some quiet to relax during the night. At $800/night for the suite the owners should take more care. I expect some noise pretty much wherever I stay in New York but this was ridiculous. Also, no one told us upon check-in that breakfast was included so we missed it the first day.

The beds were great, with lots of pillows, high quality sheets and down comforters. Breakfast is included, which works well for us. There was a variety of breads, muffins, bagels, cereals, fresh fruit, coffee and hard boiled eggs. There is also an instant espresso/cappo/latte machine in a nice little library room off to the side of the lobby, which is open and free 24/7. Also hot water and tea selections. The staff was friendly, helpful and offered us free bottled water whenever we came in looking tired and sweaty from a day of NYC. There is also free bottled water in the room. There are two computers for guest use in another room off the lobby, which was great for checking NYC info, as well as printing boarding passes. The location of the hotel is great-- close to many attractions and a metro stop, but also on a fairly quiet side street. The workout room was clean and had a full range of equipment, as well as a loft area for yoga and stretching. We didn't need help navigating the city, but I overheard staff offering helpful, clear directions and suggestions, with free maps, to other guests. One thing that didn't seem to work so well was how breakfast is set up and served. There just wasn't enough staff the weekend we were there to make sure tables were cleared, coffee pots refilled, food replenished as needed and enough tables and chairs for the amount of guests wanting to eat at the same time. If you want to miss the chaos, show up early. Also, I always travel with earplugs, so noise rarely bothers me, but my kids complained that there was some kind of fan or generator (very loud) that kicked on and off throughout the night. We were on the 2nd floor, away from the street, so other than the fan, it was quiet and low key. The bar connected to the hotel lobby (doubles as the breakfast room in the morning) is beautiful and cozy, but drink prices were really steep-- $14.00 for a martini, and $7 for a beer. We decided to hang out in the library and have herbal tea instead. Better to wander down the street and have a nightcap somewhere else than pay those prices. Overall, I would recommend this hotel, but only if you can get a better rate than is typical.

When I arrived, I was greeted by a doorman who offered me some bottled water and to take my bag while I stood in a short line to check in. When I walked into the lobby, my first impression was that it was very cheery and light; a truly charming feel. Off to the left is an extraordinary bar and library area. The hotel lobby radiates a simple and elegant disposition. I immediately noticed the staff, all of which could easily have been mistaken for models. One would expect that they might have attitude from this well coiffed group, but this is where the nice surprise comes in: they are as beautiful on the inside as they are on the out. I was told about the complimentary breakfast, and whenever I had a question, I was given a detailed set of directions, including a map. And the staff always offered to call transportation for me. There is complimentary coffee and tea in the lobby area, by the way. I was astounded when I read other reviews that some didn't feel the staff was very warm. I cannot disagree more with that assessment; they were fantastic. The hallways were clean, with terazzo floors with mini one inch tile accents, again in black and neutral taupe tones. The light fixtures were deco. If you chose to use the marbled staircases, they are very convenient, but I had no wait taking one of the elevators. When I arrived in my room, I was again pleasantly amazed! The room was beautiful. The bed was about 6 feet from the doorway, and the foot of the bed was about 4 or 5 feet fromt the opposite wall, and the other side of the bed was a couple feet from the window sill, which had cleverly used this space covering the radiator with an elegant upholstered bench, done in a tasteful, modern jacquard fabric in olive tones. The walls are a light yellow color that my interior decorator friends refer to as \"petal\". Whatever. It's very easy on the eyes; neutral and not too bright. The ceiling and a 10\" trim were a crisp white, and the floors and wood trim were stained and painted a contemporary contrasting black. The hardware was all polished nickel; not that \"feel the warmth of India\" nonsense with tacky brass. The beds headboard was an artistic scrolled metal grid (backlit) that was mounted to the wall and floor-very smart as it doesn't vibrate (think about it for a minute and you'll understand). The sheets were a complimenting light yellow stripe; crisp and clean they reflected the room's design. The blinds were a thick black wood with an olive herringbone fabric down the middle. These are not cheap, cheesy window treatments, people. The bathroom, albeit smaller, was equally as impressive with a stainless steel basin, coordinating fabric shower curtain, consistant color scheme, and black soapstone tile and countertop. The room was stocked with bottled water and several Aveda accoutrements, as well as a repair kit and shower cap. There was a nice wall mounted hair dryer and a phone in the bathroom as well. I personally like a smaller bathroom; what on earth do people want with a gigantic bathroom in a hotel anyway. My room had a cedar lined closet! Yes! Unbelievable, I know. It was equipped with an iron and accompanying ironing board, serveral thick hangers with trouser clips, and there was a bag for complimentary shoe shine service, of which I did not take advantage this trip. My room was in the front of the hotel. I slept well. I noticed some complaining of street noise. Hello, people! This is NY! You are going to hear noise. The room had a small writing desk and upholstered chair, an alarm clock, and phone as you would expect. It also had a television, and a CD player/Radio system, which was playing a soothing soft jazz when I walked in. It made me laugh a little that they went to this extra trouble to make a good impression. In the bar area, you can order food. I noticed the chicken satay appetizer for $10 right away. To put into perspective how reasonably priced this place is, I had a caesar salad around the corner at TGI Fridays and it was $17 and $5 for iced tea, no refills, and it was served to me by a crass woman that looked like cottage cheese poured into a nylon leotard. Got it. Around the corner to the right on fifth avenue, there is a small deli called European Deli. Very reasonable, and a cafeteria ala carte situation. The NYSC gym is conveniently located across the street, which made me happy. I hope this offers some insight. Don't hesitate to stay at the Mansfield.

But otherwise way overpriced, snobbish, and unaccommodating. What do you get for $260+ per night? My family of four got the following for a three night stay (almost a thousand dollars -- ouch!): Even though we booked our room expressly for four and specifically requested two double beds, when we arrived we were told that no such rooms were available and that we had to settle for a room with only one double bed. We were informed that we could move to a two double bed room the following night. We were also told that we could be provided with a fold-out cot. When we complained, and asked for a discount because of the inconvenience, the male desk manager refused and then went into an arrogant rant about how other people like us who were inconvenienced chose to upgrade and pay the extra money for the upgrade. We told him that we would put up with the inconvenience for one night (rather than come out of pocket another $75!). The female clerk at the front desk then offered my wife and I a glass of champagne (undrinkable swill!) and a glass of water for my boys, which she said was to accommodate us for our inconvenience. I then noticed that the champagne bottle was already out behind the desk, and I asked the clerk if the champagne was complimentary for everyone who came in, not just us. Sheepishly, she admitted that this was the case. We were then led to what had to be the hotel's worst room: shockingly small with no closet, just a pole with some hangers covered by what looked like a shower curtain; a double bed on wheels (somehwere in NY there is a hospital missing a bed); a bathroom door that wouldn't close because the knob assembly was broken; peeling wall paper; and a window air conditioning unit that buzzed and whistled all night long. A fold up cot eventually appeared that was barely big enough for our 14-year old to sleep on (with his feet hanging over the end). Needless to say, with our 14 year old tossing and turning on his \"child's size\" cot, my wife and I trying to sleep with our 6-year old between us on a precariously mobile double bed, and the air conditioning whistling the \"Colonel Bogie March\", we did not enjoy a restful night. Luckily we were moved to a little bit larger (and only slightly more \"plush\" - Ha! Ha!) room with two double beds for the the next two nights, where, at least, we were able to get some sleep. But no apology was ever forthcoming, and no complimentary anything. The rest of our stay went with no incident until the last day, when we were set to leave. As we entered the lobby, we noticed that the adjoining sunken bar area was serving a continental breakfast. When we asked if this was complimentary, we were told it was. But no one had bothered to tell us when we checked in! Places such as this give New York \"hospitality\" a bad name. We will never, ever stay in this overrated, overpriced, boutique (read: \"antique\") hotel again, nor would we recommend it to our family, friends or colleagues, who oftern travel to New York on business and pleasure.

Great food, fast service, good prices, and friendly help.)

Paid $219US/night x 3nights using their internet site. PROS: 1.Location! - Amazing central location!!!!! Literally 30 second walk from Fifth Av. and 4 mins Times Square, 3mins to Grand Central station. The street is quiet and safe. No worries walking from Times Square back to hotel even at midnight. Several other hotels on street making it quite populated by tourists. Probably saved a decent amount of money on not having to take taxis. Subway station at grand central and times square. This is the best part of the hotel! 2.Decor -nice classy small lobby with a bar/breakfast area. The rooms where nicely decorated with brushed steel/black wood type finish. Comfy bed and down duvet. 3.Free bkfast -assortment of cereal, fruit, juice, milk, bagels, croiss, muffins. 4.Decently friendly staff -able to help with questions/recommendations, generally helpful. Needed maid service at night, quick to respond. Stored baggage for us. CONS: 1.Room size -stayed on the Penthouse level - queen size bedroom was small but apparently a regular size room. The room was no bigger than 15x10'. Heard stories about small washrooms, but ours was actually a good size. Hallway in penthouse was very narrow. Apparently the room across from ours was an amazing 2 storey room. I guess for $219/night, I was disappointed with the size of ours. Try Priceline for a better price. 2.Utilities -had to wait ~30 seconds for the tap to flow cold water from the sink. Air conditioner only had one setting (max) and remote couldn't control it. had to shut it off as too cold. 3.Elevators/Anemeties -slow/small elevators. Website stated that they had bathrobes- i didn't see any. No free computer usage, couldn't find the small travel info booth. Renovations started- not sure what they're doing but an area for sitting/computer area would be nice. OVERALL: I guess I would probably stay here again, although I'm not sure i'd be happy paying $219. Try getting it cheaper than that. The location is superb however, and unless you want to be directly in Times Square, the location can't be beat. Other hotels that i would check before making reservations are the Iroquois (2 buildings down) and the Millenium (3 buildings down) -both looked a bit nicer and I'd consider them for a similar price. Other hotels that you might want to check out are DoubleTree Times Square, The Marriott Times Square, and the Hilton Times Square. I wouldn't settle for a peripherally located hotel as you'll end up paying more for taxis or walking longer distances to catch the metro. Times Square is always well populated and being close and having a small walking distance made us feel safe. Finally, I'd recommend not taking the express shuttles to and from the airport/hotels.

The sofitel is just across the street. The glitz of the website is positively NOT indicative of this small, run-down, a tad dirty hotel. I paid $250 here through the hotel website and feel like i was really taken. The room was semi-clean, we found trash in the cans and the pillow smelled of perspiration. My daughter got 3 bruises in the bathroom as you couldn't turn around without injuring yourself on the sink, wall, tub, wall phone, etc. amazingly small, would call it teeny or tiny instead. The comp breakfast consisted of no more than dry bagels, muffins and coffee. we had to wait for juice refills. the computers froze upon arrival and we had a 15 minute wait at check in. our room 202 was ON THE STREET and garbage trucks were cruising all night long...no sleep, also the room was just above the entry foyer and at the bar's closing there was very loud laughter that made it impossible to relax...yet another thing, the room straddled the staircase...all this at $250 a night. Please do not waste a night here.", "Date": "June 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cNot my cup of tea\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1776406", "Content": "The room was very, very small.
