It is located right in the centre of Downtown and is always busy. The room was clean and had everything we needed. We had a couple of nights where the music from Freemont was heard when we went to bed, but this was because we went to bed a little earlier due to jet-lag. The room was cleaned everyday and shampoo etc was stocked. The bed was comfortable and very big. Included in our stay were 3 free breakfasts each. The breakfast is VERY good and you get a decent sized portion (felt full afterwards). Included in the breakfast are a choice of bacon or sausage, 2 eggs (cooked to your choice), shredded potatoes and 2 slices of toast. It wont take you long to get down to breakfast as the lifts are damn fast!! The casino has a good choice of machines and the tables always seemed to be busy. Waitress service was very good and quite frequent too. During our stay at the Fitz, we were looking for places to eat...we recommend the following places: The Heart Attack Grill - located down the Freemont strip - The burgers are excellent but one piece of advice, the chips are cooked in lard and they come browny coloured, they don't taste spectacular. When you go in, they place a hospital band on your wrist and they gown you up ready for surgery. The waitresses are dressed in nurses outfits and the cleaner is in scrubs - its excellent!! Thai Vegas - just off the main Freemont strip towards Gold Spike Hotel. Its a little Chinese/Thai restaurant that also do takeaways. Their food is delicious and have had their meals about 4 times now. Their portions are big too!! The restaurant in Fitz (where breakfast is located) - This is very good value and big portions. If you order from the back of the menu, salad buffet is also included in your meal and its very good!! Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the Fitz and would recommend it to others. The other good thing about this hotel is that it was a really good deal for the standard of hotel and room. (there are no resort fees like most of the hotels in Vegas). We found that staying Downtown in Freemont is a great atmosphere and the entertainment at night is great. Music shows with the lights on the hour from 8pm is worth watching.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cHotel Stay\u201d", "Author": "lcarvill", "ReviewID": "UR127808852", "Content": "This hotel is located right on Fremont Street, great location.

For those of us who need little pampering, preferring clean inexpensive accommodations, The Fitz is the best bargain in Las Vegas. Room 1215 was spacious and 100% satisfactory; in fact, at $29 per night, it was an absolute steal. I was allowed to check-in at noon, and had no trouble getting a 1 PM checkout. Every employee I encountered was professional and friendly. My room had an extremely comfortable king bed, plenty of pillows and towels and an awesome view. There was a work desk and an upholstered side chair in addition to the one at the desk. The TV was not a large flat screen, but it was fine. The bathroom was spotless, medium sized. The closet was small. There were some burn holes here and there, and I was not wild about the high pressure water conserving shower nozzle, which could not be adjusted. The housekeeping staff worked fast and was unobtrusive. Breakfast in Fitzgeralds Courtyard Grill was cooked to order and fairly priced. Don B\u2019s Steakhouse seems to be undergoing a conversion to a more casual concept. I was disappointed that a NY Strip steak was not on the menu, and my porterhouse was on the thin side, but my server went out of her way to make my meal enjoyable. The casino staff at The Fitz is outstanding. The dealers and pit bosses have a good time with you, making the inevitable losing less painful. Kudos to table games supervisor Becky and my host Suzanne. The atmosphere in the casino at The Fitz is right out the 1970s, so if you\u2019re looking for something trendier, refined or elegant, I would suggest taking your bankroll elsewhere. If you are looking for fun while gambling, The Fitz is the place. I hope the new owners don\u2019t try to make Fitzgeralds into a replica of their Golden Gate property, which is a little too hip for me. It\u2019s all but certain there will be a name change in conjunction with the remodeling and upgrading, so if you want to experience The Fitz for what it is, and what it isn\u2019t, go now. Those of us who prefer Downtown over The Strip know to expect panhandlers and the homeless on the eastern part of Fremont Street.

The best alternative to a taxi to Downtown from the airport and back remains the public Westcliff Airport Express bus. $2 each way, and the trip takes a little less than 30 minutes: http://www.rtcsnv.com/transit/route/westcliff/westcliff(11-07-10).pdf.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGood Budget Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Eddie S", "ReviewID": "UR123699375", "Content": "I stayed at Fitzgeralds on Jan. 13th & 14th for the second time.

Room was clean and tidy (shower head moved on the wall slightly - only fault I could find) and because of the new OTIS elevators top to bottom took about 8 seconds - serious ear popping if no-one called the lift on the way down.

Seriously for what we paid where would you get a hotel as good as this in the UK - its cheaper that a travel lodge.

We actually had a breakfast buffet one day in the Paradise buffet over in the Fremont casino - excellent value for money for only 8 dollars each.

Check in was fast and the clerk was friendly. She put in room #3029, high and facing east, away from Fremont Street. Also quiet, high and away from the Fremont Street Experience noise. Beds were comfortable, but the pillows left much to be desired, but I put up with them. Bathroom toiletries were of hight quality, which was a surprise, The furniture was quirky, to say the least. The large dresser had only two working drawers and nothing in the large space below them.. The end table had no working drawer. The lack of drawer space was made up for by the three large drawers in the T.V. credenza. The in-room safe required a key, which meant that I had to have it with me constantly. Maybe if they ever upgrade the rooms, they'll install the kind that work with a touch pad, whick is much preferable. The bathroom sink had no plunger installed (??), but drained extremely slowly. Sort of an offbeat compensation if there ever was one. If my wife had been with me, I would have asked to switch rooms, but soldiered on alone with this irritating drawback. The low rate included a coupon book and a free daily breakfast in their restaurant, which I didn't eat once during my four night stay. I opted for the \"graveyard specials\" at other properties around town. On the whole, it was a value-priced room that delivererd as expected without many additional frills.

The facilities downtown are fantastic and all the casinos are within a short walking distance, unlike the strip where the hotels are so far apart. We visited the pool bar at the Golden Nugget one evening and the view of the aquarium in the middle of the pool was amzing. The Fremont Experience was as good as always. There was free entertainment on the stages dotted around Fremont most nights. I enjoyed the Fitz very much and would not hesitate to stay there again, and again, and again.... The Courtyard has some fantastic daily specials, like freshly cooked to order pasta with free soup and salad bar for an incredible $5.99. Their New York Strip steak special is $9.99 up until 6 pm. The food and service were very good. The pool area is at the back of the property and includes a jacuzzi and small pool. It was not very busy and there was room around the pool and sun beds available each day. Overall I know you get what you pay for but what can you get these days for $22.

It never ceases to amaze me how many people there are out there who will pay $29 for a hotel room and then complain that it wasn't luxurious or modern enough. We had a great time here. Yes, the furniture, television, and other fixtures in the rooms are kind of a throwback to the 80's. However, everything in the room worked right and appeared to be in good shape in spite of its age. We never took advantage of the free breakfast as we don't like getting up early or standing in line, but it is available if you want it. I only have two negatives about this place. There are only a couple dozen chairs at their pool, and the hotel has over 600 rooms. You do the math. If you get to the pool anytime after 10 or 11 in the morning, you might get stuck sitting on the floor. Also, there are 34 floors in the hotel and typically one out of the four elevators is out of service. We sometimes had to wait much longer than expected for the elevator, and on one occasion we ended up using the stairs. Overall, we felt we got an excellent value for the money and would stay here again. My fiance and I are 30 years old and it's good to see a lot more younger people staying downtown now. On previous trips, we sometimes felt like we were the only people there not getting social security checks. To those reading this, if you've never stayed downtown before, go for it! The downtown hotels are an excellent bargain, and you'll have the same fun and great experience as people that are paying four or five times as much at fancy hotels on the strip.

The Coffee Shop boasts a varried cuizine with everything from burgers to ribs. There is also a McDonalds and a Krispy Kreme in the hotel lobby.

Our rooms were clean, beds comfortable and we enjoyed being on a high floor, but the look is definitely faded 80s. Plumbing is probably older than that. Drains gurgle even when they are not being used, the walls rattle when the shower is on and one early morning water was barely tepid. AC units are also noisy. Staff is cheerful and friendly, but not always on the ball. The housekeeper greeted me twice one day, but never made up my room despite the fact that it was empty for all but half an hour during her entire shift. When I got back at 6 and saw that the room still hadn't been tidied, I called housekeeping and they sent someone up. But if the price is right as it was for us on a recent busy summer weekend, it's a reasonable choice (especially at nearly half the price of the only marginally better Four Queens next door, or a third of the somewhat ritzier Golden Nugget). Cheap gambling just downstairs rounds out the downtown experience. The fans didn't do a whole lot to cool the balcony bar over Fremont Street, but it was nice to sit and watch the crowds for a while.

For those who want a quick opinion the Fitz is a clean, comfortable hotel and good value for the money. For those looking for more details and specifics my detailed review follows. This was our 1st stay, and overall we were quite pleased with a couple exceptions, detailed below. Front desk/check in/out - very good. Our check in was handled quickly and efficiently (like 2-3 minutes), plus we got the room we booked (not always the case in Vegas). While checking in we requested a mini fridge and it was brought up to our room promptly, while we were still unpacking. Room - in a nutshell our room was clean and comfortable with a comfy bed. For the price we felt it was a good value. Just remember you are not staying at the Bellagio (plus paying little in comparison) so don\u2019t expect ultra luxury. Considering the Fitz\u2019s rates we were completely satisfied with the room. Our room consisted of 1 king bed (2 doubles same price), 2 sitting chairs and small sitting area, desk, so/so TV, iron, coffee maker, and as mentioned, mini fridge. One minor complaint was the A/C worked well but was quite noisy. We stuck a empty match pack between the blades and the unit and that quieted it fairly good. Housekeeping - excellent. We\u2019ve been to Vegas many times and we are late nighters, meaning also that we sleep late. In the past we have had problems getting our room cleaned up and restocked due to this. At the Fitz this was no problem. Despite not getting out of the room till between 2-4 PM each day our room was cleaned and restocked daily, and they did a very good job of it. We could not have asked for more from housekeeping. Pool- The pool and pool sitting area are somewhat small. I\u2019d say pool comfortably holds about 12-15 people and there are about 25 lounge chairs. There is also a 6-8 person hot tub. Pool visitors were of all ages, but learning towards mostly 30s-50s. Good music (at least for us - classic and modern rock). Pool is open till 11pm which we loved as often pools in Vegas in our experience close around 6PM. They have a limited cocktail selection which you order by phone by the pool. But you can also bring your own beverages which many people did which we also enjoyed. For us the pool was ideal as we don\u2019t like large crowds while at the pool and often there we only a 5 or 6 other people there. Depends what you want from the pool but for us it was great. Food - there are limited food options at the Fitz. There is really only 1 full time restaurant. If offers both menu and buffet services and is open approx 7AM-11PM daily. Having said that the food is pretty decent and very reasonably priced (i.e. dinner special $6.99-$9.99). They have a number of daily specials for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. There is also a steak restaurant but its only open I think 3 evenings a week. We didn\u2019t try it but looked at a menu posted on the door and entrees averaged about $30. Other than that there is a 24/7 McDonalds. Staff - generally the staff at the Fitz is very good. Nearly all we encountered were pleasant and helpful and are committed to helping you enjoy your stay. Cocktail /bar service - this is a tough one to rate because it varied so much depending on who was serving. Let me 1st say we\u2019ve been to LV about 12-15 times so have lots of experience in what to expect. We are not one of those who expects a drink within seconds of sitting at a machine. We know in most places the staff work hard and that it takes a bit of time for them to find you to bring you a drink (i.e. 10-15 minutes is not unusual or unexpected). Once they find you then generally are back pretty quick. Having said all that I must say at times the service at the Fitz was very very slow. One time I was playing a table game for about 40 minutes with no service and right after went to a machine for about 30-40 minutes with no service. Another time my wife and I were both playing a table game and went about 45 minutes with no service. We got the dealer to bring the pit boss over and we asked him to check on the service. After about another 30 minutes we still had no service and were about to leave when someone finally showed up. This is not acceptable to me. At most casinos we\u2019ve been too, tables games service is very good. Also comp drinks at the bar can be very slow. One time I sat and played at the main bar for about 25 minutes without being served. This was like at 2AM and there was only 1 other person playing, so it wasn\u2019t busy. In our experience comp drinks at the bar at most casinos we\u2019ve been too is lightning quick (i.e. offered a drink anywhere from within a few seconds to 2-3 minutes). Having said that there are some outstanding servers at the Fitz, Mary-Ann, Julie L, and Joyce in particular. These ladies are quick, friendly and efficient. Most of the other servers are at least decent and serve you in a reasonable time, but there are a \u00bd dozen or so that are very slow and drag down the overall rating and can give a bad impression to the overall service. Particularly if its your first time there and you are unlucky enough to get one of the bad ones. Players club/comps - compared to other casinos we\u2019ve been to we find the comps at the Fitz are very poor. As I said we\u2019ve been to LV many times and generally we get comped rooms for our whole stay and often meals as well. Being 1st timers at the Fitz we did get 3 nights free and a marginal discount on the other 8 nights but that was it. At the end of our stay we got a shot glass (yippee!). I should add we did play less than we usually do. In part this was due spending time by the pool each day being a summer trip and all. Still the comps/rewards seemed quite low compared to most other places we stayed. In summary we would recommend the Fitz as a clean, comfortable, hotel/casino for a reasonable price. But if you find the comp bar/cocktail service too slow either complain or leave as there is much competition that is willing to offer quicker service. Finally for anyone who values comps/rewards I would recommended you look closely at what the Fitz offers and compare it to others. While we will likely play on occasion at the Fitz in the future we probably would not stay here again for this reason as we can get better comp deals elsewhere.

I stay at downtown hotels every year when I travel to Vegas twice a year. This year was no exception. I family members arrived a day before me, so I left my bad in their room when I arrived. I checked in to my room, but did not go up right away. We decided to go to lunch first. About 4pm, I finally went up to my room. The bathroom had barely been cleaned since the last guest. I had dirty towels on the shower curtain bar. There was so much hair in the tub that you could tell it had not even been rinsed. There were fresh towels, and new soap but that was about it. I went to the desk to tell them about it, and they called housekeeping to come reclean it. They did, it looked and smelled clean. The following day, phone books were left in the hall by each room. When leaving the room, the housekeeper yelled down the hall to me... \"Hey, you better bring those phone books in before you go.\" All right, fine. I was going to bring it in anyhow, but to have the staff yell at you like it is your job is not reasonable. On my final morning, a knock came at the door at 8:15 am. I heard the yell \"Housekeeping\". 8:15 am on a Saturday, in Las Vegas. Las Vegas is not a town of early birds, it is a town of night owls. I groggily yelled back.... \"I am leaving today, and check out time is noon\" She replied.... \"Well if you can get ready early let me know, we have someone else checking in to this room\" Ok... don't value the guest that is there. Just try to hurry and turn over the room for more cash. Thanks for making me feel like a valued guest on my very last day ever in your hotel! I told the desk manager about this... a different one than the one I told about the dirty bathroom. She seemed concerned. But not enough to offer a free night on a return stay.

It was way below standard. When I checked in my room last year, the package to the soap had yucky mold all over it.

My room was large and the bed comfortable. The window is large and, while you don't see the glorious shiny strip, I had a view of the mountains and at night the housing developments you could see provided some shininess. I like their casino and the cocktail waitresses were more available than in most casinos I visited during my trip. The staff I encountered were all very friendly and helpful. One of the good things about the Fitz is that they are very generous with offers for very little play. I'd have to work up to being considered a low roller and even I get offers for two nights for the price of one. This includes weekend nights. It also came with show tickets (Fitz of Laughter) and coupons. It's a pretty basic room. The TV is old style but it was a decent size and it worked well. The hot water worked fine in the shower but the water pressure wasn't great. Not terrible but not great. There were plenty of towels. Internet isn't free although I understand there's free WIFI at Krispy Kreme. The only other restaurant there that I ate at was their one on the second floor. I think it's called Garden Court. It was okay (especially with the coupon at check in) but I wouldn't make a big effort to go again. The good thing about downtown is that you're not very far from anywhere else downtown. Four Queens is next door and their cafe, Magnolia's, is very good and open 24 hours. There are several other places to eat that are very close. I'd advise you to go afield for eating but then come back to the casino to play. I'd often heard complaints about the elevators there but that problem seems to be fixed.

I expect certain things but I'm also more leniant when it comes to problems because I've been on the other side of the desk. When my parents and I checked in, the FD did a great job of meeting our requests and blocking us on a high floor close to each other. So far so good. As soon as we got to the rooms we examined the beds for bed bugs. Room 2430 was good to go. Room 2424 was infested. I actually conduct the training for my housekeeping department so I know what to look for. I had instructed my parents to not unpack for this very reason and immediately called housekeeping. The supervisor who came up was dumbfounded that I even knew what to look for and challenged me on my findings. She immediately recanted however when I produced the \"evidence\". My parents were moved to 1623 which was bug free. I strongly recommend that any traveler who reads this Review become educated on checking for bedbegs. It doesn't matter if you're checking into the Ritz or the Fitz...as long as people continue to travel there is the possibility of bed begs. I asked that the Front Office Manager call me the next day to discuss the issue and Dawn (manager on duty) did just that. She was extremely apologetic and empathetic and handled the situation beautifully. We were treated to a dinner at Don B's and thouroughly appreciated her generosity/follow through. The rest of the stay was uneventful and relaxing. We made friends with the Craps dealers Herman, David and Lana as well as the pitboss Patrick. Their professionalism and personalities really helped us to enjoy the weekend and we would come back specifically to see them again. The morning breakfast was decent and dinner at Don B's is definitely a must do. Overall (minus the crawlly friends) the rooms were comfortable and accommodating. Water pressure in the showers is AWESOME! The purpose of this review is not to scare you away from the Fitz...like I said, you can unfortunately encounter bed bugs these days at almost any hotel. Moreover it is to praise the team for how they handled the situation and to definitely recommend them for their service.

Our room had 2 double beds, a dresser with 2 drawers, a TV cabinet with 3 drawers, a nightstand, and a table with 2 chairs. I liked the surge rotector with 5 jacks at the bedside floor - hard to find plugs in hotels. This time our room did not face freemont street and the noise was much reduced. POOL- is closed in January, but looked very clean. Hot tub was open. RESTAURANT - excellent value in the mornng - $1.99 for 2 eggs any style, diced breakfast potatoes, and toast. Add bacon or sausage for $1.99 more... the short line to get in moved quickly. GAMING - at least one $2 blackjack all day, MANY $5 tables, generally no waiting, pretty generous with their comps. DRINKS - cocktail waitresses come by frequently and drinks of good quality. Check out the Vue bar overlooking freemont street on the secon floor TAKE a side trip to the Outlets (off Charleston -very closeby), and if you're an adventurer, spend the day hiking Red Rock Canyon, about 12 miles away. DID NOT LIKE: Self parking garage - you have to park above floor 6 and garage winds round and round and is very tight. Other customers may drive too fast and BIG potential for an accident.

The one bad experience that we had was that we had booked a King size bed, but were told upon check in that there were none available. The twin beds that we ended up with were extremely small. So small in fact that my wife and I ended up sleeping in separate beds because there was simply not enough room in the individual twins. Not exactly an ideal situation especially when you are on vacation. We had other family members staying at the hotel as well and some of them had the same experience with not getting a king size bed. The hotel staff was all very nice and the elevator problem that used to plague the place has been resolved. In fact I don\u2019t think I ever waited more than about 15 seconds to get the elevator.

Needless to say, we did not regret our decision. As everyone should know, this is not a fancy hotel. It is a basic hotel room, so if you are looking for an upscale strip hotel, this place is not for you. However, if you're looking for a laid back, clean and basic room at an unbelievable value, then you've come to the right place! They did replace the elevators, and that alone is a HUGE improvement. No more waiting!! Customer service was excellent. Our housekeeper, Ernestine, was so wonderful. If you are lucky enough to get her, please tip her accordingly. She is worth it! We always use valet parking, and they are great guys too and will help with directions or whatever you need. We did not eat in the restaurants this trip so I can't comment on that.

My room seemed to be in slightly better shape than on previous stays - they may have updated a few things, or perhaps I just got a somewhat nicer room. If you're looking for a 4-star place downtown with all the extras, stay at the Golden Nugget. If you want a decent place to stay, sleep and keep your things, The Fitz is perfectly acceptable and typically has very reasonable rates for a budget-minded traveler. The room, like most downtown hotels, was pretty large. Had a king bed, desk with chair, two end tables, iron & iron board, in-wall safe, bathroom, and TV in a cabinet with 3 or 4 drawers. Wish it had a mini-fridge, but that's my main gripe about all the downtown hotels in general. The bathroom had little bottles of shampoo and lotion, and 2 bars of soap. I used the shampoo and lotion daily, and they were restocked each day by housekeeping. Fresh towels daily as well. The Fitz is comparable to The Plaza, Binion's and The Fremont, where I have also stayed in the past. It's a step up from the Las Vegas Club, which was pretty ratty the one time I stayed there. I have never stayed at the Golden Gate nor California Hotel, so can't make a comparison to those. I've read complaints from people re: various downtown hotels and if you're considering any of them (excepting the Golden Nugget, which is at the top of the list for downtown hotels), be aware that most of them have not been updated in years, perhaps decades. There is no such thing as a non-smoking room - they have all been smoked in at some point; last night, last week, last month...as such you might have a cigarette smell, a burn mark on the bathroom counter or end table...that sort of thing. They're also pretty basic and no frills. Depending on which way the room faces, you may hear noise from the Fremont Street Experience. I don't have any real complaints about The Fitz for this stay, which was 4 nights. Only 2 things bugged me a little: the bathroom sink didn't have a drain stopper (so you had to let the water run when shaving or washing up, which seemed wasteful), and the curtains were about 6 inches narrower than the window opening (so the morning light would flood the room at the crack of dawn). Otherwise, it was fine for my needs, which was a downtown place to sleep and stow my luggage. They do have an on-site pool, which looked clean and maintained, and a number of people were using it during my stay. Wifi is available for $12 per day - pretty steep. They have internet kiosks in the lobby which are likely cheaper if you just want to check email. They do have an Enterprise rent-a-car desk in the hotel, if you want to get out of town for a day (up to Area 51, down to Hoover Dam, tool around town or whatnot). Tips: I didn't eat at any of the on-site restaurants, but did discover a new (to me) diner/restaurant at the back of the Golden Gate Hotel & Casino, called DuPar's (not the cafe', but the restaurant & diner, which is a separate place). The pancakes are great, and huge - try a short stack, which is 3 pancakes but they are as big as dinner plates so plenty for one person, maybe even 2 people to share. They also had good salads and pies, but the chicken noodle soup was off - I think it had been sitting too long. If you're looking for some good old-school style Vegas dining, try The Peppermill or Carluccio's - the decor in both places has to be seen to be believed. For another funky experience, grab drinks at Frankie's Tiki Room. To save a good $40 or more (each way), try taking the #108/Paradise bus from the airport to downtown, and back again. Catch it at level zero, it costs $2, takes about an hour to get downtown (give or take - one time it took me 40 minutes, another time a little more than an hour - plan on 90 minutes and you should be fine). It lets you off at the base of Fremont, by The Golden Gate (across Main St from The Plaza), and it's about 4 blocks' walk to The Fitz. On the way back, you catch the bus on the other side of Main St (the Plaza side), next to the old train car. I've taken this bus a number of times, at varying times of day & night, and it's always been safe and cheap. If you don't mind getting the occasional mail & email offer in the future, sign up for the Casino Player clubs. Most of them have some sort of coupon book that comes with signing up, and/or they give you a little trinket (deck of cards, dice etc)...and admittedly most of the coupons aren't very useful, but a few pay off. For example, at one place I got $10 in free slot play, and while you can't cash out that $10 worth, anything you win, you keep - I ended up winning $65 using their $10. At another place I got a $20 dining credit and ended up paying only $2 for a giant dinner. The better perks come later - I chose The Fitz this time because they send out quarterly coupons - the one I used was for a free night for every paid night, so my hotel was 1/2 price this trip.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Park City, Utah", "Title": "\u201ckicked us out\u201d", "Author": "skisickie", "ReviewID": "UR78953353", "Content": "daughter took her disabled dad to the mens restroom and walked the wheelchair into him after checking to make sure no others were there.

I have stayed at a bunch of Vegas hotels and not one of the them have been perfect when it comes to being clean. The casino and Fremont street makes for fun people watching but watch your stuff, there are a lot of homeless people at night looking for any opportunity. We actually had a very intoxicated homeless guy ask to share our drink with him. The pool area is small but there is no loud music and we pretty much had the pool to ourselves with no kids splashing. You can also bring your drinks in there (No glass). Most of the pools on the strip search your bags and allow no drinks. Then you must buy one of there drinks for $10 and up.

If you take a shuttle make sure they know you are coming downtown, our driver first said $6, then it jumped to $9 once we got there. One side note- This is the second time we came to Vegas for a big fireworks display (other was 2009 New Years) and waiting on the strip, there was no fireworks of anykind from any of the $$Billion$$ dollar casinos.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ca", "Title": "\u201cLosing Favor - I think.\u201d", "Author": "goingblonde", "ReviewID": "UR70212418", "Content": "We have always stayed at theFitz when we are staying downtown.

The closest I have to a downside is that the furniture in my room was a little worn but it was still servicable. I can live with a little worn. A friend of mine was staying there the same weekend and her furniture looked newer and in better shape. Maybe they save the better stuff for the nonsmoking rooms. It wasn't a problem for me as everything was comfortable and worked fine. I had heard bad things about the elevators there but they've apparently fixed any problem there used to be with them. My room was on a high floor and I never had any problem with them arriving or getting me to my floor in a timely manner. I was there on Friday and Saturday so the elevators got plenty of use and I had no complaints at all. Another thing I really liked about the hotel is that it was really easy to find your way around. When I did have any questions, the staff was always helpful and cheerful. You'd never guess that they'd probably answered the same questions umpteen times that shift. The staff were some of the nicest and most helpful I've met in Vegas. I would recommend the Fitz to a friend in a heartbeat and I'm really looking forward to staying there again the next time I go downtown. This is the third downtown hotel I've stayed at (I also stayed at the California and the Fremont on previous trips) and it's my favorite so far.

At approximately 11:30 my husband called front desk to see if they had a nurse on staff who could suggest something for me to take, or at least check vitals, etc. to see if I required a trip to the ER? They sent up an EMT, who was just a security guard. He spoke with me and told me that they could give me the name of a doctor that was on call or go to Walgreens and ask the pharmacist if I could take anything. I just felt like I was going to DIE and told him that I just needed to lay down for a little while and we had to check out. Security guard said it should be no problem for a late checkout, just call the front desk. My husband called and argued with the clerk and then the manager on duty. He merely asked if we could have a late check out, maybe 2 hours or so? They told him that they were fully booked and could not do so. Explained to them that security was up in the room and wife is very ill. After arguing that they had no rooms, they told him that we could stay for a full nights rate which was $90. For a late checkout??? We just checked into the room 12 hours prior! And besides, we had a prepaid room at the Rio for 2 nights, just felt so bad could not get in the car and drive over there at the \"moment\". They were HORRIBLE to deal with.

We had move our scheduled days of departure/arrival by 1 day. Our rooms were comped through an offer we received in the mail, along with a few other perks..so we were concerned about calling to request a date change. No need. My husband called, and they had no problem changing the dates. It was simple..took about 2 minutes on the phone with friendly staff. We had to rent a car from Los Angeles to drive into Las Vegas..not our original plan by any means..but we got there. We had read about the tight squeeze in the parking garage..but as we located the Fitz, there was an easily spotted sign for valet parking..sweet! Worked like a charm. Friendly guy and took care of the car. Returned in the shape we gave it to them in! Couple of dollars later, we are at the check in desk. Also friendly easy service. Got our room with no wait at about 7:30 pm on 02/14. Gave us additional coupons to use at checkin, which we did use several. Upon checkout, room was exactly as they said..free. No resort type fees at all. Sent us off with a thank you and hope we had a nice stay. We were given the comped room on the 7th floor. It was average, as expected. The elevators, the entire stay, were Zero problems. Had read here previously that they were slow. We entered our room and it was older furniture but not tore up completely as some would say. The bathroom fixtures older, yes..but funtional. Large vanity sink area, which we like, Low flow shower head in a tub/shower combo. Yes, it was older staining but I would not say it was dirty. It was over time built up. No fan in bathroom, just the slats things in the wall above the toilet. Towels, washclothes provided were clean though not \"plush\"..but again, usable. Provided toiletries and kleenex and plastic glasses along with ice bucket. No coffeemaker as stated on website. If we had called down, we may have gotten 1. We travel with a small 4 cupper anyway, so to us, it was not a problem. In room safe worked fine. Located in closet with hangers, ironing board/iron. There was a full length mirror on bathroom door, which is much appreciated and NOT supplied in a lot of casino hotels we have stayed in. Large vanity mirror as well along with working hairdryer. Since we only had been there 1 night for a short period of time, we did not require room service the first day but did tip the gal in the hall, replaced towels ourselves and some plastic cups from her cart. Had her cross off our room, as we could not find a do not disturb sign for the door. We left our bathroom belongings out in the bathroom, tidied up the rest, locked up valuables and never had 1 single problem. We did use housekeeping the other days of the stay. Left a tip on nightstand each time and was thanked by staff when we they saw us. Room was done way before noon each time, (we transfered to strip hotel morning of 02/17) Yes, TV was older but worked fine. We were placed on 7th floor. No view really. BUT I could easliy see the digital clock with time and temp each morning at casino down the road...that was nice! The main dresser only had 2 top drawers with a wood panel that ran along the bottom where, my guess would be, broken drawrs had been removed and recovered with wood panel. The room we received was located on the side street near a concert stage. We could look to the right and see the top of canopy. Yes, it was loud. Thunderously loud when the Canopy played its screen..but that is to be expected. We were right right beside it. There was also a band playing till 11 or maybe even midnight..beside us and it too, was loud. We were in room first and second evening before those were done..early nights, and I can imagine that some people could not sleep with that going on. We, however were so exhausted the first night- the bomb going off outside the window..did not keep us awake, or wake us. I would have to say the same the second night. We turned TV up a notch as it went on..to hear the words coming from there but it IS LAS VEGAS and it can be loud anywhere. We were not high enough to avoid the noise..so I can not say that you can't hear it further up. The bed was good. Not bad at all. Pillows..flat. Our room was 2 dble beds. No king available they said. We used the pillows from that bed too and it was fine. The casino restaurants were also fine that we used. We ate breakfast at the Courtyard grill. They had a 1.99- 2 eggs, hashbrowns and toast. They also offered 4.99 steak, hasbrowns and toast with 2 eggs. (You could order bacon or sausage for 1.99 to any meal) Service was fine, food was fine..it was not dirty. We did not get to eat at DonB's steakhouse, which we regret. We had wanted to try it- and there were discounts offers given to us as well. We did use the McDonalds one morning for a breakfast to go while playing a few slots to get the morning started. Ate from the 1$ menu. We played some fun slots. Upstairs there is cash in/cash out. Thats fine..except mine ran out of nickles..and was trying get 15.00 out. Had to wait quite some time for service as the man was alone..and working with another patron, He wasn't thilled about it, slightly stressed I would say, but he did speak to us..was just trying to get his job done and move on to the next machine in need. We tried keno for the first time. We won 2.00. Used the coupon offered to us..lost 18.00 of the 20.00 but have an understanding of the game now. Bell desk was helpful to us twice. We had to return rental car to the strip the first morning and he was trying to see closest place to return the car. Then, when we were checking out, they arranged a Towncar service for us thru Exotic Limo..that got us to NYNY..without having to use a cab. (40.00 to NYNY with SUV that arrived to take us, nice driver, safe!) We used the Players desk several time and had a lovely woman, tiny- wait on us each time. We got a free shotglass with our points! Each got 5.00 play, I think..or cash, don't remember really. She was very sweet and we enjoyed her alot. Actually seemed to like her job! Gaming was OK. I didn't win big bunches but did play for a while on what I put in. My husband played 3.00 craps tables..about the same. Enjoyed some of the slots himself. I don't think we ever saw his favorite slot there- Fireball, but he found some others to keep him occupied while waiting for me in the mornings. We did both eat and drink at the Vue bar on the second floor, twice. We used a 241 appetizer coupon we had, and all the dollar drink coupons, or 241's they gave us. We sat outside for a bit the first night and watched the street below us. The food was OK..didn't rave but good. Had chx ranch flatbread pizza and chx fingers with veggies. We split each and for 8.95 or so total for both- enjoyed the TV and people watching..Bartender was a funny guy first night. I would say our stay here was just fine. The hallways were clean to our room. Carpets were not dirty in our room and had been vacuumed. We had no problem sleeping, or problems with bed bugs at all....walked on carpet in socked feet without worrying. We are average folks that stayed at an average hotel and had a fun time!

It served its purpose well, and since I wasn't expecting much I wasn't disappointed. The room was like a basic, somewhat outdated-looking motel room with ugly decor. I have a personal aversion to oak furnishings, but if you don't, maybe you'll like it just fine. The person who checked me in was very nice and it was late so there was no line. The room was mostly clean except for a few hairs in the bathroom. After some extra wiping I even dared take a bath in the tub. The carpet looked a little worn and had a cigarette burn in it, but nothing was too offensive. There was a little peeling of wallpaper around the edges, but hey, it's an older hotel. The bed was clean and comfortable. I didn't use the free breakfast coupon but it's good not for your choice of breakfast, but for a very specific item (which I believe includes eggs, breakfast potatoes of some kind, and choice of sausage or bacon). The casino is run of the mill for downtown casinos -- again, nothing special. I moved to the Golden Nugget for the remainder of my stay (this move was planned in advance and not any kind of function of my like or dislike of Fitzgerald's), and there's a big difference between the two hotels. Fitzgerald's is pretty much just another rundown downtown hotel, but the Nugget is NICE. Casino is nice, pool with shark tank is sweet, and I arranged for an upgraded room which is nothing short of plush. My new favorite hotel is the Golden Nugget! But back on track, there's nothing really wrong with Fitzgerald's, especially if you don't plan to spend a lot of time in the room.

We tipped the maid a few dollars each day and she kept our room spotless. Thanks Bok. As for the elevator situation, there were three and sometimes only two elevators working. It was a bit more of a wait on the weekend when the hotel was busiest but I don't think I had to wait more than 5 minutes for an elevator. I didn't find the elevators as much of a problem as the patrons. If there were a lot of people waiting, the rude tourists would almost push people out of the way to get on, instead of waiting their turn for the next elevator. One time I came up behind two older ladies, one with an oxygen tank on a cart. They were first in line and I was next but several people pushed their way on before this poor women who had to manuever her tank around them. Such rudeness I don't understand. I think if people would be more civil there would be less complaints about the elevators. We enjoyed the casino and the cocktail waitresses were pleasant and came around as much as I wanted them too.

In the end I stuck with my Fitzgeralds reservation with the thought that the money saved would be used for food and games. Now home after 4 nights in LV, I'm having a hard time deciding if I can recommend the Fitz even for the low, low nightly rate. Our room was on a floor that had been remodeled recently. Well, the halls had been remodeled and looked very nice. Seeing that, I was really optimistic about the place until I opened the door to our room. Our guest room had 2 double beds, an armoire, dresser and a nightstand. The \"wooden\" furniture looked a little like the kind of thing you buy at Target and put together. Not bad, but fairly cheap looking. The beds were on the low end of acceptability. The TV had a decent selection of channels and good picture. The bathtub faucet leaked continuously and looked a little worn. The A/C worked fine but was a little loud. The overall effect of the room was one of advancing age and wear. One of my biggest concerns was the elevators. I had heard of a history of long delays waiting for an elevator and how this was now less of a problem since some of the elevators had been replaced, I'm sorry to say that it is still a problem when the hotel gets busy. Sunday morning I waited 15 minutes for a down elevator before giving up and taking an up elevator and riding back down. That is really unacceptable. I did not eat in the Fitz but ate at the Four Queens and Fremont which are steps away from the Fitz, Everyone I met at the Fitz who talked about the condition of the hotel said something like \"well, for the money it's okay.\" Personally, if I had it to do over again I'd spend another $10 -15 a night for the Fremont of 4 Queens.

This review was from a trip that i took at the end of may. I've been going to Vegas for the past 4 years, I find that Vegas is still the most affordable place to take vacation. The entire package was just under $800 for three people, including round trip airfare, and 4 nights in the hotel. We stayed at the fitzgeralds, this is my second time staying there. The first trip was with my dad, and we a had wonderful time as well, so good that i booked this trip at the same hotel. The Fitzgeralds is an older hotel, as many of the downtown hotels are. The room quality is good, a little worn around the edges but not dirty. I've read many complaints about the elevators, there are signs posted stating that they are in the process of upgrading their elevators. We personally weren't affected by long wait times, or over crowding of the elevator cars. We stayed on the 17th floor, and never had to wait over 3 minutes for an elevator. The staff we encountered were all very friendly, polite and helpful. The only place we ate at the fitz was the McDonalds located next to the casino. The prices there were the same as home, and they had the dollar menu. We avoided the Fitz buffet because of the poor reviews, the Main Street Station and Fremont have very nice buffets. The room was very adequate for our needs, and served it's purpose well, we were never back to our room before midnight so noise from the Fremont experience wasn't an issue. The view wasn't spectacular, but did look out to the mountains, which was nice. The curtains are the very thick \"Black-Out\" type which is great when you end up getting in around sun-rise and need to power nap before hitting the town again :-D My overall experience with the Fitzgeralds was great, The only minor thing was the narrow paths in the parking garage, very little room to move if another car was coming, and the winding up to the 6th floor was a little dizzying, but then again it's a small garage, for a small hotel. They do have a pool, however we didn't make use of it, but did see it, it's not in the nicest location. The pool is right next to the rear access road, and is surrounded by 7foot tall concrete walls, looks like a pool cell more than a pool area, and the pool was a simple square shape, but the water was clean and blue so that's a good thing :-)", "Date": "August 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canyon Country", "Title": "\u201cDo NoT StaY HeRe\u201d", "Author": "soinluv74", "ReviewID": "UR37317260", "Content": "i booked a reservation in advance for my husband and 2 co-workers and when they showed up at 2am after a 5 hour drive, staff told them that the reservation was NoT on file.

Check in was quick with no wait around 10:00PM. There was a flyer on the counter about the elevators being upgraded. but we encountered not one problem with them. At most we waited maybe 2 minutes. We were staing on the 17th floor. Breakfast came with our US Air package they give you your coupons at checkin. Breakfast was served extremely fast and consisted of bacon or sausage, eggs, homefries and toast and coffee. We used the pool after breakfast before it became too hot and noone was hardly ever there. We had the pool to ourselves and it was clean. It was kinda weird though walking outside the hotel past the valet parking entrance to get top the pool, but it was nice and not crowded. As far as the gambling goes I played a little BJ...nothing to heavy and walked away a small winner. Fremont St. was nice and don't miss Carl Ferris the sax player. If you're not trying to impress your girlfriend or have been married as long as I and can't impress the wife the Fitz should meet your needs. I liked the fact that everything was close and the layout was easy to figure out....not like some of the bigger hotels on the strip. Access the self-parking garage off 3rd and Carson....small sign says Fitz parking. If self parking wind up past the 6th floor. Although I didn't park across from the swimming pool behind Walgreen's I did see people parking there and it would be easier then winding up around the Fitz garage. Overall it was decent.

No biggie, we headed over for breakfast and did some gambling and arrived back at 12:45 just to check early. Ya never know! We got our room keys and were headed up to room # 3424. Top floor of the building and the room was much to my suprise very nice! Loved the large windows and so did my husband! Bathroom was decent size and clean, no complaints there. Not overally huge but it worked just fine for our needs. And we even had a coffee maker. This is the 1st hotel we have ever stayed at in Vegas that has had a coffee maker. . . we never used it however but it was a nice gesture. Bed was comfortable enough, rested well. Breakfast on 2nd floor for $1.99 and that was very good! The best buffet that we ate at was at Main Street Station! Awesome price! Awesome food and selection. Only downfall was the carpet in our room was not vacuumed very well. It wasn't the cleanest upon arrival but was taken care of later. The elevators sometimes were on the slower side but really not slow enough to truly complain about. Maybe had to wait no more than 5 min or so at times other times we got right on an elevator! The Hotel itself was smokier than I prefer but our room however was not at all and beig I didn't spend tons of time in the casino I wasn't too concerned about the ventilation system. It's to be expected when these are older hotels. Didn't have any luck in the casino area nor did we anywhere else either but then again I don't go to Vegas to get rich! Overall was very impressed and would stay again. Great customer service!! Would not recommend Bell Trans for shuttle . . . over 45 min late for a 2pm pick up and we had been waiting since 1:45. When I called at 2:15 they informed me the driver had already drove by the pick up area which was an outright lie and when we did get picked up they picked up at the wrong location. We were told out front at Registration in front of the shuttle pick up sign and they picked up on the west side of the building. Very disatisfied with Bell Trans!

We wanted to stay downtown this time around. 1st the bad: -Elevators are slow. Though normally not more than a 5 minute wait, the last day we waited 20 minutes as we tried to check out. -Service not so great. Barely saw the cocktail waitresses, check-in nearly refused to check us in. We were not told by hotel or travel agent that a deposit is required. We had arrived the night before we got paid (direct deposit) and only had limited cash on us. Wanted a $50 credit card (we only brought debit card) or $100 cash. We offered to give it to them the next day, and was told they couldn't. Luckily they allowed $20 cash. -Unclean. Not to the point of fearing bugs, but tub was slow to drain, and 2 days in to trip saw it was because a sticker in drain. Easy to grab (but I wasn't going to put my hand down there) but not caught by housekeeping for who knows how long. Feet were black after walking across the floor. Gave tip each day and asked for extra towels the first. The next day towels were gone. Apparently have to ask for them each and every day. The good: Courtyard Cafe - and their staff. Friendly, and the Sliders were excellent! Ate dinner/the Sliders the first night, went back the next night just for the sliders, and went back for breakfast our last day. The slots were fairly loose. We didn't hit it big (though 2 or 3 people did in the 3 day span), but won enough to keep us playing. We were able to play quite a while on $20. The location was great. The Deuce dropped off people right by Fitzgeralds, and only had to walk a block to catch bus to Strip. Walgreens right across the road, so we got water, etc there when we wanted it.

Weekends would have been $49 tops I think. I used the $20 bill trick and actually did get a room with a nice view (3348 I think.) The view rooms are basically corner rooms, and have a \"wrap around\" window. One view from my room faced the Stratosphere Tower, the other faced West. The room itself was older Motel 6 fair, but was fairly clean. Bedspreads looked and felt very used. There was a small in-room safe for guests, which I used. It was free. Maids were pretty good about keeping people out while they were cleaning the room. i.e. you couldn't just walk into a room unless they KNEW it was your room. A good thing at this hotel, as a few of the guests are a little seedy due to the low prices. I also met LOTS of nice people here during my four-night stay however, so the undesirables are probably the minority. Most people I met staying there seemed to be middle-aged. Got a player's card, which is only good at Fitzgerald's Las Vegas I believe. I played craps and some blackjack at the casino. Craps was $5 minimum and 3X4X5X odds. They went up to $10 minimum at times, but you could always stay at $5 if you bought in before they raised the limit. Nice dealers for the most part. Preferred to play my craps at Binion's however, though they had the same minimums. Another thing I liked about this hotel is the fact that the walk to the rooms isn't too terribly long from the elevator. This is because the hotel is really not that big, though it is one of the tallest (if not the tallest) hotel downtown. I was at the opposite end of the hotel from the elevator and it was a walk, but not nearly as bad as some larger hotels. The hotel is located on one end of the Freemont Street Experience (the south end I believe.) I liked this fact as it was also close to a Walgreens and a couple of gift shops where you could buy your bottled water, sodas etc. The \"Deuce Bus\" also stops just up the street on Las Vegas Blvd. They'll ding you about $13 per day for Internet, though they do have it. They also had a business center near the lobby, though I didn't use that. Overall I enjoyed my stay there. The price was right and you get what you pay for, but for those on a budget it's a great value and much better than some of the other \"cheapies\" downtown. I'd recommend the Fitz over the Plaza, Las Vegas Club etc. If you want a \"nice\" place to stay downtown, try the Golden Nugget's north tower. Usually the GN is about $100/night for north tower rooms, but sometimes they are just $79 per night.

The Fitz is about 1.5 miles from the bowling facility and seemed a good choice.

You notice this if you lift up the seats at some of the slot machines and see what the carpet used to look like. There are only 4 elevators to service the 34 floors and 600+ rooms. They are so slow that one routinely waited 10-15 minutes. When I approached the front desk they said that they were in the process of upgrading the elevators and that one was new and used digital processing while the old 3 used analog and they didn't talk to each other well. Indeed, the new elevator was frequently out of service. The beds varied wildly from acceptable to downright unusable. One of our group finally asked to be moved to another room only to be shuffled twice because someone apparently had kept a room key and was occupying a room thought to be empty. Other people commented about the poor quality of the mattresses as well. Our room wall heater/air conditioner failed to maintain the temperature (on the cold side) so we let the front desk know that morning and asked for a repair during the day. When we returned it hadn't been touched so we went back to the desk and a tech was sent. He said the filter was too dirty and he would fix it. It never did function correctly. The casino allows smoking and the low ceilings, combined with a poor air filtration system made it uncomfortable (we are non-smokers). If you want internet (wireless) access the hotel wants to charge $12/day (which is ridiculous) but you can do down to the Krispy Kreme shop and get free access. The employees rarely smiled and many appeared like they didn't want to be there. There are only two restaurants and both are dated and marginal from a food quality standpoint.

If there were a lot of people waiting to catch the elevator up, you could quite easily wait 5-10 minutes. Similar waits on my floor while waiting to go down. At non-peak hours it was just a couple minutes. Garage elevators were just fine. - Very slow drain in the bathroom sink, which would back up and gunk would come up and out into the sink. I assume the maids knew about it, since they did clean the sinks and running the water would cause it to back up, but it was not attended to. The neutral: - Room was a bit frayed and worn around the edges, but I knew that going in, having read other reviews. Plus it was a smoking room - not like they're going to replace things that will just get stunk up / burn marks etc. - My room was overlooking Fremont Street, which has a pretty loud sound & light show every evening (once every hour, on the hour, until about midnight.). Quite audible in the room, didn't bother me enough to switch rooms, but others may find it annoying (in which case, request a room on the other side of the hotel). - Loud A/C unit. I like a bit of background noise when trying to sleep, so it didn't bug me too much, PLUS it did help drown out the noise from Fremont Street. - Wish they had a mini-fridge in the room; there was more than enough space to place one. The positive: - The price, only $40/night during my stay. - Location: right on Fremont. If you've never stayed downtown and want to experience some of the older / original Las Vegas, this hotel is a good choice. However, Fremont is a bit limited and after a couple nights you may have already seen it all - an option here is to rent a car from the hotel (they have an Enterprise desk and cars on-site), and the hotel has a free parking ramp for guests, so you could drive to the strip and park at one of the hotels there for a night on the town, or take a drive to Hoover Dam & Lake Meade, or just explore other parts of town. I had rented a car at the airport ($9 per day weekend special from Enterprise) and parked free at the hotel, and did get a good bit of use out of it. Easy to catch a taxi to the strip as well. Depending on time of day, a drive the hotel and the airport, utilizing the interstate, can take less than 20 minutes. - Room size: was quite large compared to other budget-friendly places I have stayed previously (on the strip). More than enough room for 2 or 3 people. - McDonald's and Krispy Kreme on-site, for when you want a quick bite but do not want to wait in line for the area restaurants. At peak times, every single restaurant / buffet will have a line, there is no avoiding it. - Proximity to other casinos etc: walking distance to numerous casinos, buffets / restaurants, bars, vintage neon signs at the Neonopolis, souvenir shops, convenience & liquor stores up & down Fremont, and a few other casinos right outside the Fremont \"experience.\" Notes: Fremont does have its share of local vagrants and such, but I never felt threatened and they generally just seemed to hang out more than anything - was only asked for change once. You're allowed to walk around on Fremont with open containers of beer, drinks etc, so there's a chance you may see a few folks stumbling around, but the police presence was noticeable and never did I see any negative activity. All in all, I would stay here again, or along Fremont, if I wanted to stay in the downtown area.", "Date": "December 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nebraska", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay at the Fitz~~~!!!\u201d", "Author": "IMJBS", "ReviewID": "UR22389954", "Content": "We arrived at the Fitz on October 10 and were glad to be able to check in at 10:30 am.

I had a double queen non smoking room, handicapped, and the bathroom was quite large, with a tub/shower combination, and a very wide sink/vanity. Nice accessories furnished, Pantene Pro-V shampoo & body lotion, and boxed individual soaps, both facial and bath sizes. Housekeeping took very good care of things, bringing extra wash cloths (a stack!) when I asked, and extra coffee for the coffee maker. TV channels are basic, but there are several. Who watches TV in Vegas anyway??? I found the casino help, hotel accommodations (check-in girl was so friendly, and helpful... there was no line, and I got a nice Funbook from her) bell staff, and the people at the Courtyard Grill to all be welcoming and helpful in all aspects. I had a Bleu Cheese Burger with fries here that was killer for $8.95 minus a $2.00 coupon off from the Funbook !! And a lunch special (Crab linguini with garlic bread for $6.95) that was also very tasty. I'll be back, Fitz!

The hotel is in the \"old\" part of town, right at the beginning of the Fremont Street Experience. Anytime I get THREE NIGHTS FREE, which we did with the tournament, I think it's excellent! The hotel itself is a bit tattered and worn (but clean) - and the ventilation systems are not quite as good as the newer casinos. Things feel a bit \"tighter\" than in the sprawling taj mahals on the strip. But overall, the good outweighs the bad. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly, for one thing. The buffet is very good and free drinks are served often. There is a Walgreen's Drug store steps from the front door. And best of all, when you play in a tournament, you get three nights' room absolutely FREE. In addition, (and I assume this applies to other tournaments), we received four meal vouchers (for the player in the tournament and a partner) and two other tournament meals, an evening buffet and a breakfast, and player shirts. Now, HOW GREAT IS THAT?? The keno tournament is held 4 times a year, but they also host other tournament events, which, I am guessing, have similar perks. In the keno tournament, you put up $500, but get the full amount back to play in the tournament, and you get to keep all your winnings. Of the approximately 100 players, about 1/4 earned all their money back. The top winner took home over $11,000. We met some \"regulars\" at the tournament who said, \"Why stay on the strip when the only thing I need my room for is to sleep?\" The sleeping rooms are adequate, the beds very firm, and the shower was hot. Depending on the time of day, the four elevators could be slow, but that's true with any high-rise hotel. For those unfamiliar with Fremont Street, it is 5 blocks of pedestrian mall with a 1,400 foot canopy light show - billed as the world's largest. It's unlike anything you've ever seen. Also available in the mall area are small shops, drug stores, other casinos, and restaurants - all within easy walking distance, unlike the strip. There is nightly entertainment outside your front door. The Deuce Bus, which runs the length of the strip, is available for $5/day, so it's easy to get out to the other end of the strip if you want to tour other casinos or go to a show. So, check out Fitzgerald's Casino. Las Vegas deals are still there, if you know where to look!

The bathroom was average size and the water pressure is good, but the wall paper was pealing off and the shower head was loose and coming out of the wall. The housekeeping was average, but the second night we noticed a shortcut taken. They put a full size bed sheet across the king bed sideways instead of getting a king size fitted bed sheet. This is a bad sign! Parking is free, access the self-parking garage from the rear (3rd St.), just write your name and room number on the ticket and you'll never pay for parking.

Fremont St. is pretty neat with shopping and access to the other casino's within a short walk. There is McDonalds and Krispy Kreme donuts in the Fitzgerald's, and Dunkin Donuts in Four Queens. We didn't eat at the casino restaurants, but they looked ok. The Fitzgerald's, and the rest of downtown, is a long way from the Strip. You shouldn't walk it. It's too far, plus it's not safe walking around downtown outside the safety of the casino's. If you do go to the Strip, park at the Excalibur, which is street level and free parking, and it's a short walk to the rest of the Strip.

The card club offered items for joining and comps which we applied to the room cost, as well as cash rewards. Room rates were great - $340 for a week and that was for a busy time -- rodeo days. There is a 24 hour McDonald's if you want a quick bite to eat. We did not eat in the restaurant/buffet after reading the trip reports complaining about the food. But there are many restaurants nearby. I recommend Golden Gate, Las Vegas Club and Lanai at the Fremont. If you plan to go shopping or to the Strip it is a short walk to the bus depot. There was plenty of entertainment on Fremont Street. Note - it costs $7 to $8 for a shuttle to or from the airport. It took us an hour to get from the airport to downtown, because the shuttle dropped people off at hotels on the strip first.

This was my first downtown experience. There are plus and minuses at this property that was supposedly renovated a few years ago. My room was on the 24th floor with a fair northly view. Although the room was supposedly non-smoking there is some tobacco smell (perhaps coming from the floor below?) but it's not strong. The room is good sized, bedding and towels clean, two queen sized beds were rather firm and the mattresses seem new. No bedbugs. I could not tell if the carpeting had been recently steam cleaned because it was a dark shade (chocolate) but walking on it with bare feet was ok. The carpeting is coming up in spots. There is a secure wall safe w/key (no deposit), a hair dryer, and iron/ironing borad. The room lighting is adequate but one ceiling light needed a new bulb. The television is ok but the choice of channels is limited. Closet space good. Furniture is ok and not worn. The bathroom was clean and there is plenty of counterspace for personal toiletries. The hotel provides your basic soap and shampoo and these were adequate. Lack of an exhaust fan means that moisture will remain on the walls and ceiling, which in turn means mold. Just abit of mold above the shower. A serious problem is the shower curtain. Some idiot did not include a plastic curtain to go with the fabric one which means water on the floor every time I used the shower. I had to use a bath towel to sop up water. One good slip on the floor and you can say lawsuit! The shower faucet had a leak (waste of water). Unlike other hotels in Las Vegas the Fitz does not seem ecology minded (they don't ask guests to conserve water and reuse towels). The air conditioner was fine and not too noisy and does help cover some of the music from the Fremont Experience. The Fitz badly needs window washing. The exterior corridors are clean with less wear or wall marks than I have seen at some upscale hotels including the Luxor. Major problem is the elevators. Only three of the four were in operation and a few times I waited for 10 minutes for one. This could be a big problem in a medical emergency (there are separate service elevators not accessible to the public). The hotel itself is clean and fairly easy to navigate. The casino seems easily accessible for those who are handicapped (not so in certain other hotels). Directional signage could be improved. One good thing is that the hotel/casino is not so big that one spends 20 minutes getting to a restaurant. There are some entertainment options that I did not partake. The buffet is closed until later in Sept. The restaurant does not have a huge selection or variety on the menu but it 's not too expensive and the portions are large. My one big complaint is that sometimes noise from renovations in the buffet area can interfere with eating (why not give some discounts for the trouble). Oh yes. This is not a 24 hour restaurant except on weekends; other times there is McDonalds. The steakhouse looks good but I did not try the food (reservations suggested and I suggest dressing up some). The Vue bar has outdoor seating above street level. It has appetizers that come from the restaurant. Customer service is good and staff seem friendlier than at hotels on the Strip. Housekeeping did a good job. I had no problems with check-in or check-out but then there were no lines of people. My overall impression is that the Fitz is ok for the budget minded and especially if one gets a cheap package deal. It is close to the Duece bus stop. I won't comment on the gambling but as nearby gaming options are easily walkable the Fitz has a good location. Fitzgeralds compares in quality to the Riviera but is less expensive.

We had rec'd notice the water would be turned off between the hours of 2:00am and 4:00am Wednesday morning. The shower head incident occurred prior to the time. But, after that time about 5:30am I heard a drip, drip, drip, and got up to investigate and found that the faucet to the vanity sink was running and even throuh the stopper was not closed the sink had filled up and was overflowing onto the bathroom floor. (I'm sure this probaly was due to the excessive water pressure when the water was turned back on.) When maintenance was called we were told they would be right up. (Ya, right!!! 3.5 hrs later). One of the people in my party had to come to my room to shower. When we checked out we spoke to the manager who absolutely showed no empathy , but offered to buy us lunch. (We had just had breakfast and were checking out. Useless!!!) Throughout our stay we over heard several other guest complaining about various things and the employee that they vented to always had an \"OH WELL\" this happens all the time type of response. The Fitzgerald Hotel & Casino just lost three guest and really don't seem to care. It seems odd to me that most of the older Hotels & Casino's have remodeled or done some upgrades in some way or another, except for the Fitzgerald.", "Date": "June 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis MO", "Title": "\u201cCheap and it shows\u201d", "Author": "mslefreeman", "ReviewID": "UR8016638", "Content": "We arrived early and our room was not ready.

There were only two problems that we encountered on a daily basis. There were three of us staying at the hotel on the 27th floor and the shower dripped all 5 days we were there and the housekeeping couldn't seem to understand that if you have 3 guests in the room, you need towels, coffee etc. for 3 people on a daily basis, not two! We had to call every single day we were there for enough amenities for 3 people. Other than that, the place was clean, well lit, very quiet and the view was spectacular. We felt safe in the lobby, even at 4:00 in the morning when my sister and I were by ourself. We never did get to try Limericks. It was closed and under renos every time we went. The breakfast buffet was fabulous with helpful chefs at two stations to make your fresh omelettes. Prices were reasonable at Molly's and the staff were friendly and on their toes giving good service. Security could be seen almost everywhere you looked. We did not break the bank while we were there but plan on going back to try again this October.

The room is about 130\u2019 away from the elevator. The window view is a ground roof view of the roof and an angle view of the FSE metal cover. Standing on your toes you can see the corner of the Fitzgeralds balcony bar. The Nov. rising sun provides plenty on reading light in the low wattage room. You can hear the bass of the Fremont Street Experience. The sound is not real bothersome to me with the air conditioner and TV on. I did not have a problem sleeping, but most people will be bothered. The stairs next to the room come out on the 1st floor inside the high roller roped off area, but that was not useful to me. I could not find a door to the second floor on the stairs. The rooms above (423 & 523 maybe) on floors 4 & 5 dirextly abone appear to have a curved window in the corner of the room, while 323 does not. Fitzgeralds does not have in room internet access, but does have a public (pay?) room downstairs. I could pick up the free wireless signal from Crispi Kreme on the first floor, but it was too weak for me to use. A signal booster might make it work since the donut shop is directly under the room. The TV has a few more channels than other downtown Vegas hotels, still no favorite premium channels but the channels are: 2.KVMY My Network TV 3.KVBC \u2013 NBC 4.C-SPAN \u2013 II 5.KVVU FOX 6.In room KENO 7.TBS Atlanta 8.KLAS CBS 9.Univision Spanish 10.PBS KLVX 11.WGN Chicago 12.USA 13.KTNV \u2013 ABC 14.CNBC 15.MSNBC 16.ESPN 17.CNN 18.Fitzgerald Channel 20.Hotel Info 21.Hotel Info 22.LV Tourism Convention 23.Classical Radio 24.Country Radio 25.Rock Radio 26.News Radio 27.NBC KVBC Channel 3 LV 22.There were (3) adult channels that played free around the clock, which was a real surprise. I noticed you could also purchase them, but they were free in this room on channels 37, 38, and 39. There is also a control lockout for parent or wife. The room had a tiny one cup (10 oz) coffee maker in the bathroom. The small tea or coffee bags with a string will work perfect in it if you bring some. Other fixtures: Ironing board, king bed, iron, free key safe, proterra shampoo, conditioner, lotion, facial bar soap, and large oatmeal bath soap, 2 large towels, 2 medium towels, 2 wash cloths, 3 ash trays, ice bowl with 6 cups, 2 coffee cups, 9 coat hangers, complicated alarm radio clock, king bed with 3 pillows, one closet pillow, 4\u2019 diameter wood table, 2 chairs, one sofa chair, large 2 drawer dresser, 3 drawer wood entertainment center, (2) one drawer night stands, 3 lamps, 2 trash cans, 3 phone books, phone with $1 per call, Philips 29\u201d regular screen TV/remote, in room movies $10.99 each, smoke detector, fire alarm, 3 fire sprinklers, tissues, 3 mirrors, 2 pictures, tissues, and of course toilet paper and bible. I left $1 in the bible for you. The air conditioner could keep the room extremely cold and the fan noise moving the air was the only loud sound. The room was roughly about 30\u2019X17\u2019 including the bathroom. Fitzgeralds has no room service, no hair dryer, and only two electric wall plugs. They do have checkout available on the TV. The hall had a $1.50 20 oz drink machine and a free ice machine. Molly\u2019s Buffet is minimal selection, but has an omelet chef in morning until 11 AM. Buffet breakfast has 2 boxed cereals, make your toast, hash browns, 2 sausages, milk, 5 juices, sodas, 5 pastries/muffins, 2 scrambled eggs, bacon, minimal fruit, and jelly. Coupons are available for Mollys at check in and at the front door in the evening. The Fremont and Golden Nugget Buffet are larger. Molly\u2019s Caf\u00e9 is small but has excellent service and a $9.99 steak & shrimp. The 4 Queens, Golden Nugget, and Horseshoe caf\u00e9 are better.

I played a lot of slots and more times than not cashed out ahead. The slot attendents were always around to help with change or whatever. The cocktail waitresses were always coming by. I don't think I ever waited more than 5-10 minutes for a drink while playing the slots or table games. The table dealers are pretty friendly. They make it fun to play there. Cabs to the strip are a bit spendy, but if you don't want to cab it, take the Duece double decker bus that comes by. For $5 you can ride for 24 hours anywhere from downtown to the end of the strip.

When we arrived they had our room totally not as requested, then changed us to a room that had no refridgerater in it, less towels and wash clothes than were needed and as we were only staying minus flying time 2 days, waiting to try to get what we needed took up most of our 1'st day. Our air conditioner did not work and it was over 100 degrees there. I had reserved and arranged and paid for my disabled father and mother in law and their room was not handicapped and they had the wrong kind of bed requirement as we did.

My room was on the 21st floor, out of I think, 34 floors in the hotel. For an extra 10 bucks, I got an upgraded room, as is my custom. Room # 2134. $39.00 plus $10.00 + $49.00 plus tax, so call it $55.00 a night total.. No extra hidden fees but you were warned of a charge for local calls at $1.00 each and even more for long distance. I used my cell phone, good signal strength from Cingular in the room. Checking in and out was no problem. Electronic door lock and 2 keys. No bugs. I had heard complaints about the elevators but I had no problem with them. There were 4 and they moved pretty fast and there was only a reasonable wait time for them. 21st floor hall was in good shape with new carpet in appealing patterns but it had begun to come up at the seams but I guess hauling those heavy baggage carts around will tear any carpet up over time. Ice machine and soft drink vending machine near the elevators. Quiet in the room, no sound from the hall nor from other rooms except some sound of running water in the bathroom. The A/C could be considered loud by some but I am a city boy and not used to the quiet, so for me it was just a little background \u201cwhite\u201d noise. Comforting in a way. King sized bed, bedding was fine. 3 pillows plus 2 extras from the shelf in the alcove. Mattress was fine. One could feel the springs through the pad if you worked at it but it was not noticeable when sleeping. The best bed I had so far was at the California, that may have had that memory foam pad, anyway it was a nicer bed than at TI. In the room there was the bed with wall mounted headboard and two night stands, misc. lamps, alarm clock, a small desk and chair, an easy chair on the wall common with the bathroom, a round table and 2 chairs near the window, a dresser and armoire with TV above and drawers below. All in great shape, no sign of wear and everything worked. There was even a shoe buffing machine. Decent sized color TV that got local channels, live Keno and tourist infomercials and CNN. Not a problem because I don\u2019t go there to watch TV anyway, just the local weather and later the weather back home. Remote control worked fine. Carpet, a \u201clucky Irish\u201d green color, was in good shape, no wear and was clean. General room decor was pleasant. A very few black marks where wall met the luggage carts but not really noticable. Housekeeping staff was efficient but not all spoke English. so there were a few Fawlty Towers moments when the statement that \u201cI will be back at a certain time and please be done by then\u201d was not always understood. One wall was waist to ceiling windows facing west. You had a view of the hotels nearby with mountains in between., you could just see the time and temperature on top of Binions. That was handy to see how hot it really was. 103 at sundown one day, an hour or so later it had dropped 10 degrees to a bone chilling 93. In late afternoon, with the hot sun on the windows, even with the A/C on high and the black out curtains shut, the A/C struggled to keep it cool. It was not hot but could have been cooler. The curtains blew around a little while the A/C was on. Bathroom was fine, it had a tub and shower, a long marble countertop with one basin. Good stuff in small bottles, about standard, not a name brand but it smelled good. 3 sets of bath towels, hand towels and wash cloths. These were not as soft as at home but nor were they the sand paper you get at a lot of places. Shower as fine, the water pressure was very strong, almost too strong, think fire hose. There was no way to turn down the volume of water. After a while in the shower there was some water built up in the tub. By no means a problem for me. Also, in the bathroom was a coffee maker with 2 cups. ample supply of plastic glasses. A hair dryer that started out mounted on the wall then fell off due to a poor anchor bolt. I reported it and it was fixed promptly. Some un-gluing of wallpaper above the shower, probably due to humidity. No closet, your clothes were on a rod in an alcove on your right as you first walked in. A good number of wooden hangers. Shelf above for other stuff. Also an iron and ironing board. Stout room safe mounted in the wall of the alcove, used a key. The hassle with that was where to put the darn thing. I personally prefer a electronic combo safe for that reason. Internal volume was maybe 14 inches by 12 by 4 deep. Probably as big as the one at TI but smaller than the one at California. Not quite big enough for a full sized lap top, you could probably put 2 large hard cover books side to side, with a little room to spare. No fee to use the safe. The ground level pool was nice but nothing fancy. A rectangle maybe 30 by 20 and 5 feet deep max. A few palm trees but nothing elaborate. Ample plastic loungers and a good supply of towels. No attendant nor life guard but there were cameras. I noticed security ask a couple with 2 small babies not to put them in the pool. Maybe for safety reasons but frankly they did not look housebroken to me. You could call from drink service. Plenty of sun in mid August and I think it would be sunny in all but the coldest months. Pool was a street level with a wall on 3 sides and a fence on the 4th side facing a drive way. Not right on the street, so no problems with people passing by. Your room key opened a gate. There were washrooms nearby accessed with your room key. Pool was open 7:00 am to 11:00 pm.

We got back from our Mother's Day brunch at 2:00 pm to find BLACK SLUDGE all over the ceiling, tub, toilet & floor. (But the tub drained). She again called and talked to housekeeping who assured us that they would have it all cleaned up by the time we got back that night. We arrived back at the room at 2:00 am to find a newly painted ceiling over the tub, but nothing else cleaned in the bathroom. Daughter called housekeeping again, then the front desk, and was offered another room which we refused (what was to say it wouldn't be just as bad), so was assured that the problem would be taken care of first thing in the morning. We left at 10:00 am, returned at 3:00AM, expecting a nice clean bathroom & a nice long shower, only to find the same mess. This time we got a different housekeeping superior who came with a housekeeper within 5 minutes of our call, complete with two gallons of disinfectant & other cleaning supplies. They were shocked to see the condition of the bathroom and immediatly set forth to fix the problem like it should have been done in the first place. When they left, we could have \"eaten\" off of the floor or any other surface of that room. I wish we would have gotten their names, because they definately should have been rewarded for THEIR excellence. To bad the rest of the housekeeping help wasn't even half as good as them. In all fairness, the sheets & towels were clean. And the McDonalds all night cafe had milk available for me to take my medications with. Also, our friends had no problem with their room.

We arrived not expecting much after reading all the reviews on here. Check-in was quick and painless for arriving at 5pm on a Friday. The front desk staff was pleasant. We requested a room on a high floor despite the complaints about the elevators. We got a corner room on the 25th floor. The room was outdated, the bedspreads worn and there was an empty spot above one of the beds where a picure once hung. The bathroom was a nice size with good water pressure. We had an excellent view of the mountains and it was nice to watch the sun come up in the morning. The beds were not very comfortable but after staying out gambling till the wee hours it didn't bother us too much, if we were staying more than two nights it would have really disappointed me. The comments about the elevators were completely true. We waited about ten minutes every time we had to go up to our room. And coming down, we stopped at nearly every floor. Plus, the elevators were hot and because of the long waits, you were often crammed in with a lot of others making for an uncomfortable ride. We used the parking garage and that was a horror as well. The valet takes up the first six floors and maneuvering around is difficult , especially with a bigger car. I'm sure there have been plenty of accidents in there. The pool is small and located next to the parking garage, but it was very clean and uncrowded. Another plus, its open till 11pm, unlike some strip properties.

I have to commend the hotel staff as very friendly. On previous occasions we gambled at their 5 cent slots and found them loose and enjoyed the long play, but this time they were very tight. This was the first time we stayed in overnight in their rooms. We prefer larger rooms and asked for a suite. We were told customers can ask for upgrades when they check in, but cannot reserve suites ahead of time. We were also told that they had deluxe rooms (regular rooms), the club suite (for player's card holders, when available), and luxury suites (which were supposedly very nice and an additional $100 a night). We also asked about internet access which I need for my work, and were told yes, it is available. When we arrived, we upgraded to a club suite because no luxury suites were available. The only difference between a club suite and a regular (deluxe) room is a coffee pot, hair dryer, ironing board and bottles of water. The room size is no different than a regular room. There were no luxury suites available. The club suites were small rooms, with two beds, poor a/c-fan circulation and a flickering tv set. Since we didn't plan to spend much time in the room, we decided to rough it. This worked fine until the elevators quit working. Two days in a row, my husband walked down 11 floors of stairs along with many other guests. At least we were not on the 32 floor as some of his companions were. The elevators would go on the blink and stop at every single floor all the way up to 32 and all the way down to one. We were unable to board a down elevator during this time, so in order to use the elevator and not walk (which was not an option for me) we were forced to get on the elevator traveling up from floor eleven to floor 32, then back down to floor one. This took 25 minutes each time with nauseating stops at every floor all the way up and back down. I am diabetic, bad knee, and have Meniere's (a type of motion sickness). When we called the front desk to request a service elevator (which were working) for my transportation, we were refused. We explained that I had taken a insulin shot and needed to eat within 30 minutes, but were still refused. They offered to send room service but we knew that would take over an hour. I rode the elevator, without recourse, and we just stayed downstairs and avoided the rooms and elevators. As far as we know, no one was offered compensation for the inconvenience.

I decided on average because when we returned from our 10 day stay at Fitzgeralds last year, I wrote a letter to management complaining about several issues that we had while we were there. THE NEGATIVES: When we checked in, we were told that the room with a king bed that I had reserved several months in advance was not available and that we would have to take two double beds instead. The desk clerk knew we were on our honeymoon, but refused to upgrade us or try to accomodate us regarding this. If we wanted a suite, she informed us it would be an extra $100 per day. We were on the 27th floor and when we arrived there, we found that the soda machine on our floor was broken and the ice machine dispensed so slowly it took almost five minutes to fill a bucket. Therefore, whenever we wanted a beverage, we had to go up or down a floor. We were also very disappointed that there was no refrigerator in our room, which was a major annoyance due to the length of our stay. Also, with several restaurants in the hotel, we were very surprised that they offered no room service. The elevators were very slow while we were there. We waited on average 5 to 10 minutes, sometimes longer, sometimes shorter. We really didn't mind waiting for them unless we were in a hurry. Which wasn't often because we were on vacation! We ate twice in Molly's buffet; one lunch and one breakfast. Compared to other buffets available in Vegas, this one we found to be overpriced and very limited in selection. Disappointing. We also ate at their coffee shop which is attached to the buffet on our last night there. This was most definitely the worst service we received during our stay. We waited almost half an hour just for the waitress to take our order, then were forced to order off of an extremely limited \"late night\" menu, then waited nearly an hour for our food. Not a great experience. THE POSITIVES: Our room was surprisingly spacious with an absolutely breathtaking view of the mountains. It was also extremely clean. We had housekeeping in every day to clean and they always left us extra towels and linens without us even having to ask. The room had a small safe so we were able to safely store our valuables as well. With the exception of the desk clerk that checked us in, we absolutely loved the staff at Fitzgeralds! Everyone was unfailingly friendly, polite and helpful, from the cocktail waitresses, table dealers, bartenders, cashiers, security, everyone! Plus, since we were there for 10 days, many of them took notice of us and went out of their way to greet us specially and make conversation. We felt very wanted there and it was wonderful. The casino was great! The slots were pretty loose espeically when compared to the strip. Plus, my husband tried his hand at blackjack, which he had never played before. The dealer went out of his way to help him and gave him tips on how to play! We also loved the balcony that was off of the bar on the second level. It overlooks Fremont Street and is a great place to sit and watch the light show and just watch the people. They also had karaoke several times while we were staying there and the host was excellent with a great book. Long rotation though, which is par for the course. So, at the beginning of my review, I mentioned that I wrote a letter to management. Well, it took 8 months but I received a response from the Vice President of Operations last November. He apologized for the inconveniences that we suffered during our honeymoon and offered us a return incentive.

These people crack us up when they complain about rooms. With the turn-over in these hotels, and the way a lot of people treat property, they can and will get a little \"worn\" between refurbishings. We have stayed at several strip locations over the years and have to say that once you get on the elevator there isn't much difference from one property to the next.

When we checked in, we inspected the room and found ink like stains on the bed linens, so we called the front desk and asked for a room change. The original room was 1841. The front desk said they would change us, and to come down to the front desk to switch out the keys. Having experienced this problem previously elsewhere, many hotels will bring you new keys, instead of making you hall all luggage down to the front desk and then to the new room. It was a minor problem in comparison to the next one I\u2019ll detail, but a problem nonetheless. When we checked into our new room 1941, we noticed the same type of ink like stains on the linens. From this, we just thought it\u2019s a problem in every room, and at least the stains were not directly in the center of the bed. The entry way light blinked violently, and instead of reporting it we decided just not to use it. Our biggest problem with our stay, came from our first night and involved housekeeping. At about 1:15am we were awoken by knocking on our door. In my experience, when you don\u2019t answer people will realize they have the wrong room and walk away \u2013 but this was not the case. I heard a voice say something resembling \u2018housekeeping\u2019 and they barged into the room. Obviously we were confused, and yelled at the person to get out. They replied by saying something neither of us understood and left. Because of this incident, we had extremely poor sleep that first night, waking up every hour. The next morning, I went down to the front desk to complain to the manager about this incident. I asked the attendant for the manager, but she wanted to help me so I decided to tell her about the incident. She seemed willing to help, and contacted the housekeeping supervisor for an explanation. After the phone call, I impressed upon her that I needed an explanation as to why housekeeping people are coming to my room at 1:15am. I told her the only logical conclusion I could think of, is that they were looking to steal personal belongings. The attendant didn\u2019t disagree with my impression. She said I\u2019d be notified as to why housekeeping came into my room, and I told her I\u2019d be waiting in my room for a call. The call and explanation never came, and I was too busy to worry about it until I got home. Because of this unwanted and disturbing intrusion, we were extremely mindful to not have any maid service come into our room for the remainder of my stay, always keeping the privacy please sign, bolt lock and sliding lock on the door. It deprived us of one of the qualities I really look for in a hotel \u2013 safety. The only other concern I had about my stay, is the availability of internet at \u2018reasonable prices\u2019.

I am really disappointed in the a la carte nature of Las Vegas hotel casinos, believing that because they offer restaurants and slot machines, they can skimp on the things a traveler demands in any other city in the world. I am talking about a gym and business center, free of charge to hotel guests. Those are the bare minimum in my opinion, for a decent hotel \u2013 so if you want to elevate yourself among your competition, you\u2019d add them free of charge. I would appreciate a written response to the problems I\u2019ve taken the time to detail here, especially the late night housekeeping debacle. This is not the first time I\u2019ve stayed in Fitzgeralds, but I\u2019d seriously consider it being the last based upon the discrepancies I\u2019ve detailed.

We had a few problems with the elevators, as there are only 4 in the hotel (and there were many times that we would have to wait for the elevator as they were oftentimes too full). I didn't get to see everything that I had hoped to see while in Vegas (I stayed from 9/19-9/23) because it was a pretty long trek to the strip from Fremont street with traffic.

The dates were the 18-21st of August 2005. The front desk allowed us to check in and proceeded to give us room keys when we checked in at around 0930am. We were excited to get a room so earlier in the day. We then we found out the room they gave us was a two double bed room instead of the King I requested.

The only restaurant we ate at in the hotel was Molly's Buffet. We had breakfast there and it was excellent. The price was also good. We also ate dinner but that came at a price. I will explain. We were riding the elevator from our room located at the 32nd floor. We were in the elevator with an other couple who we did not know at the time. The elavator was travelling down when it made a loud noise and suddely stopped and jerked us around in the elevator. A few seconds later the door opened and we all decided to get out. A unknown woman entered the elevator when we exited and she became stuck in the elevator. We noticed that she got in before we could stop her and the door shut. The floor counter did not move and we heard the clicking on the elevator. We could hear the alarm being pushed from inside by the woman. A long story in a short form is that we called for help and the woman was rescued but we had to walk down 26 floors and then were only componsated with a free dinner buffet. The worst part was we had to use the elevator for the rest of our stay. Well back to the buffet, avoid eating dinner at Molly's it was terrible. I would not even recommend it for the cost of walking down 26 flights of stairs. The hotel does have a single outdoor pool and whirpool. Both of these items are very basic and would compare to what you would expect to find in a residental backyard.

After staying on the strip for the past 3 nights, we arrived at the Fitz around 5:30 pm to check-in. The building smelled musty and old, but that was expected for it being an older hotel. The guy at the counter who helped me was not very friendly or helpful. I had called the hotel several days before checking in to confirm my reservation and request 2 beds in a N/S room-no probs, it was noted in the computer. When I asked the guy at the counter if a room with 2 beds was available he said 'yes', then told me we had to wait for approx. 2 hrs because the room was not ready. He said he would make a quick call up to the housekeeping supervisor to confirm the availability and after hanging up he said that it would be around 30 mins before it was ready. I was a little disappointed because we were checking into the hotel after 3pm, yet they did not have any clean rooms with 2 beds available. Furthermore, at the same time that I was checking in, a woman next to me at the counter had requested the same type of room and she got it-no problems. I stepped away from the counter and figured we would just wait around the lobby since it was only supposed to be a half hour wait. After about 10 mins of standing around and me probably looking really frustrated, the guy called me back over and told me another room was 'suddenly' available. He handed me the room key in the little folder and didn't even have the decency to give me directions to the room, muchless direct me to an elevator. The room ended up being on the very top-34th floor, in the corner, with a view of the top of the Freemont St canopy. When we finally got to the room it was very HOT and stuffy. We immediately located the A/C and turned it on....that thing was sooo loud that we were practically yelling at each others the whole time we were in the room. To make things worse, the darn thing wouldn't even cool the whole room off. In order to feel any kind of cool breeze, you had to be standing right in front of the unit. Part of the reason it probably never cooled was because the unit was not completely attached to the wall (there was a big gap between the inside wall and outside). We decided that we were going to just deal with it, as we were going to be outside on Freemont St for a good part of the night and we figured that if we left it on while we were gone it would cool off some by the time we got back. That was a big mistake because when we finally got in, it was sooo hot that it was practically unbearable to sleep. Not only was the room temp uncomfortable, but the beds were as well....double beds w/springs poking at your back!!! We somehow made it though the early morning hours and were ready to check out. Overall, everything was gross and dirty-unvacuumed carpet, holes in blankets, bathroom, etc. We did enjoy the dowtown atmosphere; however, we will definitely NOT be staying here again. The customer service, along with old, scruffy rooms does not make it worth the hassle.

Needless to say, we will not be returning to the Fitzgerald on our next visit to Vegas in May. I must say we were quite disappointed in the Fitzgerald Casino's idea of customer service.

I got all the way down to the casino, found out I dropped a $20 bill, rode back up to the 23rd floor, and there was my $20 on the floor.

My only complaint, I found my \"lucky\" slot machine a little too late, the morning we were leaving. Ended up putting that $20 bill in and took out $115 in 45 minutes. Staff was all nice.

We ate at Limericks Stake House - you have to try the shrimp or chicken scampi. Both excellent choices! I have to tell you that after reading some of the postings - we were a little worried.

But, they offered the best deal ($49.00!) for a weekend room and money was an issue (isn't it always?) so we decided to give it a try anyway. Good decision! Frankly, we were expecting an older room that might be in need of remodeling, but even that would have been acceptable. For us, going to Vegas isn't about the room- we're hardly in it anyway. lol What we got was a very pleasant surprise! Though we arrived VERY late (2:00AM) due to a terrible accident on the I-15 (we were parked for nearly an hour!), they were able to give us an upgraded, recently remodeled room on the 19th floor with a wonderful view of the strip. It was clean, spacious, quiet and very comfortable. From the moment we arrived to our departure Sunday afternoon, everyone was nice. The food was fine, the casino wasn't too crowded and we won a little money too! (Don't worry, they got it all back!!) We had a great time downtown and happily spent nearly all of Saturday wandering from casino to casino and enjoying the many shops and vendors. Some people have complained about slow elevators and we didn't experience that at all. The longest we waited was perhaps one minute and most of the time it was only a few seconds. Also, and for those of you like me who schlepp their own luggage to and from the car, the parking garage elevators and the guest room elevators are only 50 feet or so apart. I've been in some hotels where it's a half-day hike! For me, it's little things like that that make a big difference. Same thing with the room. Though we were as far from the elevators as possible, because it's not a gigantic hotel, the walk wasn't bad at all. I've never stayed downtown before, but I would book another room at the Fitz without hesitation! Our only complaint, and this is a tiny one, would be the parking garage. It's very small and cramped, but if that's the worst I can think of, I'd say they did a pretty good job!
