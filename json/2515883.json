We did not see any roaches until the night before we were leaving. There was 1 in the living area. Killed it and that was that. Staff was friendly. Pool was great. The breakfast was adequate and saved us a ton of money for the week. We used the shuttle bus every day to go to all 4 if the Disney parks. That also saved us alot of money. The times could have been more frequent and the 07:50 am bus was very full most days. Other than that, a car really isn't necessary as the restaurants in the center next to the hotel are great.

The lunch and dinner choices were endless! The room key was a coupon for Cici's pizza, $3 off each buffet, the expiration date was for 2008, however, Cici's honored the coupon but you needed to take it with you to get the discount. Cici's was a great place to eat too! Very clean and cheap for the family! Our room was perfectly layed out for our needs! I called in advance to request a crib in our room since we have an infant. The crib was placed in our room before we checked in. The room was clean, the bathrooms could have used some work. Since we do have two small kids we needed the tub, I gave it a good clean before either of the kids bathed in it, as I would anway... but they needed some TLC. The kitchen was well equipped, pans, bowls, dishes etc. The beds were very comfortable too! The outside of the hotel itself was a little out-dated, however, I know they have a construction project begining in the near future and will bring everything up to date. The downside to the hotel was that there is no elevator, we were on the third floor, which doesn't sound bad, unless you are dragging children and LOTS of stuff up and down, gets a little rough by the end of the week! The pool was WONDERFUL! Though our entire trip was 80 or warmer the pool was heated so with the kids there was NO initial chill, it was phenomenal, worth staying at the hotel for! The hottub was and kiddie pool was nice as well! The breakfast was a great feature to the hotel, it was wonderful not having to pay for one meal for the entire family the length of our stay! If you are expecting a 5 star breakfast don't eat at the hotel, the food was tasty and fresh, but just enough to tide you over! If you are looking for omlets and casseroles you shouldn't eat there. They did provide, eggs, waffles, meat, cereal, bagels, donuts, muffins, toast, juice, coffee and pop. The perfect start to our day, we aren't demanding breakfast eaters.

We are a family of 4 (2 year old and 2 month old at the time) and grandma and grandpa joined us. Our needs were a little complicated since we had two young children and would need to factor in returning to the hotel for naps and also, we have many food allergies to work around so we needed a place with a full kitchen so we could prepare our own meals, and we wanted a connecting room with the grandparents. Complicated? Just a little! It turned out that to get lodging at Disney that would accommodate all of these needs was WAY out of our budget. We found Staybridge Suites had the option of a one or two bedroom suite with full kitchen and living room. We had plenty of space so that we (and our parents) could have privacy if necessary. The kitchen came fully equipped with just about everything one could need to prepare most meals. The room was very clean and spacious and the living area was quite comfortable. We didn't use the pool but it was open late and supposedly kept at 82 degrees. The staff was very helpful. For example, one day the internet wasn't working in the business center and I needed to use it so they allowed me to use the internet in their office briefly. The location of the hotel was convenient as well. We went back to the hotel everyday for lunch/dinner and naps. The trip to and from Magic Kingdom was a little far because one has to take the tram to the TTC and the monorail in addition to the drive but it was certainly doable.

I booked this hotel after reading a few hundred reviews on trip adviser as well as other review sites. although the reviews were helfull there were certain things i wanted to know in more detail which none of the reviews highlighted, so i will cover them here. But first, here is our general overview; Loved our stay. We found the room, a trio suite to be clean and spacious. The hotel location cannot be faulted, (Outside of the main Disney hotels) and we recieved great service. We requested a ground floor room which we had, and upon arrival we requested an in room kettle which was delivered within five minutes, fab ! After the first week we experianced some minor issues with the room, (A blocked WC and a loose towel rail) and again, these were fixed by the time we returned to our room later the same day. The breakfast; Whilst i can understand some of the negative reviews, at the end of the day this was no five star banquet, (but neither did we expect one !) there was enough choice to keep us happy; toast, waffles, cakes, cereals, eggs, fruit, sausage, yoghurt, ham, porridge, juices, pop, hot drinks. If you want to laze around all morning relishing your surroundings and eating the finest food then book a five star hotel elswhere, otherwise if you are like us and want to have something to eat that will keep you going half the day b4 hitting the disney parks then this will do nicely. the free snacks and drinks three nights a week are OK, perhaps not worth rushing back for, but if you are coming back early to the hotel anyway then its nice. Typically you get hot dogs, wine or beer, plus soft drinks. The pool and jacuzzi are clean and quite warm. They are open until about 23:00 hours every night. There are three free computers with internet and one free in the kids room. Indeed, as some others have suggested, they can be slow but still usable. LOCATION/TRANSPORT; IT TOOK ME MUCH DELIBERATION CHOOSING WHETHER OR NOT TO HIRE A CAR OR TO TRUST THE BUSSES. I TOOK A CHANCE WITH THE BUSSES AND IT WORKED OUT JUST FINE. THE PACKAGE DEAL I GOT FROM ENGLAND INCLUDED A FREE CAR FOR TWO WEEKS BUT THE INSURANCE WAS ANOTHER \u00a3300, PLUS ON TOP OF THAT YOU HAVE $15 PER DAY DISNEY PARKING !!! THEN YOU HAVE PETROL, AND TIREDNESS ETC TO FACTOR IN SO FOR ME IT WAS A NO BRAINER. I GOT THE IMPRESSION FROM OTHER REVIEWS THAT THERE WERE REGULAR BUS TRANFERS TO THE DISNEY PARKS BUT NONE OF THEM GAVE A TIMETABLE SO HERE GOES; MAGIC KINGDOM; PICK UP AT 07:50, 10:20, 11:40, 13;40. RETURN AT 7PM, 9.45, AND 11.35/12.50 WHEN THE PARK OPENS TIL LATE. ANIMAL KINGDOM; 07:50 ONLY, RETURN 5.30PM ONLY. EPCOT; 09:20 AND 11:40. RETURN 16;10 AND 22:00 HOURS. HOLLYWOOD STUDIOS: 09:20 AND 13:40, RETURN AT 15:55 AND 19:20. (23:20 WHEN THE PARK IS OPEN TIL LATE). ALL THE DISNEY BUSSES BETWEEN THE PARKS AND RESORTS ARE FREE AND REGULAR. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU ARE AT EPCOT AND MISS THE 16:10 BUS, YOU COULD HOP ONTO A SHUTTLE TO MAGIC KINGDOM AND GET THE 17:45 BACK TO THE HOTEL. THERE ARE NO DIRECT BUSSES TO DOWNTOWN DISNEY, HOWEVER HOP ONTO A FREE DISNEY SHUTTLE FROM ANY OF THE PARKS TO SARATOKA SPRINGS RESORT AND ITS A FIVE MINUTE WALK FROM THERE. THERE ARE NO DIRECT BUS FROM THE HOTEL TO THE WATER PARKS BUT AGAIN FREE DISNEY SHUTTLES GO FROM ALL THE PARKS, ALL BE IT VIA A RESORT. TAXIS; ABOUT $6 EACH WAY TO DOWNTOWN DISNEY. ABOUT $20 EACH WAY TO MAGIC KINGDOM. $15 EACH WAY TO EPCOT, $30 EACH WAY TO EITHER THE FLORIDA MALL OR THE MALL AT MILLENIA. COSTS: A TYPICAL BURGER AND FRIES IN A DISNEY PARK SERVICE COUNTER IS BETWEEN 8-10 $. DRINKS ARE $3 INCLUDING TAX, SAME FOR AN ICE CREAM OR POPCORN. FOR A SIT DOWN MEAL YOU ARE LOOKING AT 25-35 $ PER ADULT FOR THREE COURSES OR BUFFET, MINUS DRINKS TAX AND SERVICE. THERE ARE ALSO MORE EXPENSIVE PLACES TO EAT TOO. THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD VALUE PLACES TO EAT NEAR THE HOTEL:cici pizza buffet, sizzler, shoneys, subway, steak n shake, papa johns pizza, chillys, to name but a few. Furthermore, a 15-20 minute walk away will bring you to Mcdonalds, golden corrall buffet and the highly recommended bahama breeze.

It took us left out of the hotel and routed us on some great secondary roads that got us there with no traffic at all. I booked a Trio room and it was great, as my company likes for us to share rooms when a group of us attend a convention. The TVs were a bit outdated, and the wireless Internet was definitely spotty, but not bothersome enough for me to complain. I'm sure those things will be taken care of in the upcoming renovation they have planned. The food was better than most hotels where I stay. They have a virtual cafeteria in the morning, and the evenings we were there had beer, wine, and some sort of food available. The hamburger/hot dog cookout seemed the best. Enjoying that at the outside area with great weather in February made for a great time. While we didn't take a dip, many folks were enjoying the pool, which I have to assume is heated.

If you aren't going to spend every day at the parks and just want somewhere to relax and explore Orlando by car, I would definitely stay here again. My friend and I stayed for 12 days in November 2011 with plans to visit all the theme parks. The hotel was fabulous, but the location and free shuttles didn't suit our needs. Basically I recommend staying at Disney while you visit Disneyworld, as you then have full access to all the parks day and night for free and then stay somewhere closer to Universal/Seaworld to see the other parks. The Staybridge is a really great hotel, but not a good location for visiting parks. The 'free shuttles to theme parks' from the Staybridge only go to Disney World and only 3 times a day (7.40am, 10.40am and 1.40pm) and there are limited return shuttles too (7pm, 10pm and 11.25pm). (Times vary by season) Basically most of the parks closed to the general public at 8pm and we then had to wait around until 10pm or later for the return shuttle. There is nowhere to sit or shelter while waiting for the shuttles. If you are staying at Disneyworld you can stay at parks much later. Disney Downtown is only about $8 cab ride from the hotel, but you can't get to the parks from there on the disney buses unless you are staying at Disney. To get to Seaworld or Universal it was a $25 flat rate cab ride each way - cheaper than a car hire and parking I suppose, but expensive extra on top of entrance fees. The hotel itself, I couldn't have asked for anything more. We had a 2 bedroom suite(both with ensuite bathrooms), full kitchen and lounge area. Better still, it include free buffet breakfast every day and free Happy Hour every Tues to Thurs night including wine, beer and food. The pool and spa were heated and great. We both loved it.

We absolutely loved the suite.........2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, nice kitchen, 3 televisions. It was very spacious with large closets; reminded us of an apartment rather than a hotel suite. As other reviewers have noted, you must ask for a first floor room because there are no elevators. We were in Building A in Suite #213. I had requested a downstairs room close to the main building where breakfast is served and the free transportation picks up for Disney. The reservation clerk I spoke with prior to our arrival was very nice and accommodated my requests. We did hear a bit of road noise as our room faced the main roadway, but it was not too bad. You might want to request a room in another building if road noise bothers you. Now a word of caution about housekeeping. We normally stay at Marriott Residence Inns, and we are accustomed to their superior cleanliness standards. When we checked in, my daughter found an empty soda can under her bed. I found an empty dirty plastic cup under the master bed. When my husband went to get a glass from the kitchen cabinet, he picked up a glass that had red lipstick on the rim. I did report this to front desk, and I was just simply told they would report it to housekeeping. I thought an apology would have been nice. Breakfast buffet was good, but again, it did not compare to what we are accustomed to at Marriott Residence Inns. Each day the scrambled eggs were cold. When I reported this to the kitchen attendant on the first morning, I was told I could use the microwave to warm them. The problem never was corrected. My main word of warning for future guests is absolutely do NOT allow the front desk to call a taxi for you. When we checked in and mentioned that we wanted to go straight to Downtown Disney, the front desk clerk kindly volunteered to call a taxi for us. That taxi ride cost us $12. We called the same company to return us to the hotel that night. The next night we were at Downtown Disney and just used a Yellow Cab that was parked outside the World of Disney. That taxi ride (traveling the same distance) only cost us $6.60. The taxi that the hotel called for us cost almost twice the amount charged by Yellow Cab. When I reported this to the front desk, I was told that they always call the same company, and yes, they knew it cost more because the company charges a flat rate rather than using the meter. I replied that I felt like this was wrong to volunteer to call a taxi that they know overcharges their customers. I am curious as to why they would purposefully call a company that they know charges almost twice what a Yellow Cab charges unless perhaps they receive a kickback for calling that company. If you do choose to stay at this facility, just call your own taxi to avoid being overcharged. The location of the hotel is awesome, especially if you fly and do not rent a car. There is a Walgreens across the street, a grocery store behind the hotel, a reasonably priced souvenir ship across the street, and a Steak n Shake across the street. The Steak n Shake has great food with very, very reasonable prices. The free bus transportation to Disney is another perk. The bus picks up at the front door, stops by 2 other hotels, and then takes you to Disney. The bus picked us up at 7:50 each morning, and we were usually at the parks before 8:30 which was great since the parks opened at 9:00. I have left comments about the housekeeping, breakfast buffet, and taxi incident on the Staybridge website comment link. If they were to correct these issues, I would certainly consider staying at this property again.

I had to put a pillow from the sofa into the pillow sham to firm it up a bit, as I\u2019ve been having neck problems lately. I\u2019d have brought my own, but I tend to leave them behind so I decided against it. Upon request, the hotel provided a crib for our 18-month old, which was made of metal and appeared to be safe by the new government reg\u2019s. While it was a bit on the small side, it was fine for him and he slept great in it every night. The kitchen was clean, and silverware, glasses, coffee mugs and plates were provided in the cabinets along with a refrigerator and stove, and a dishwasher, which we didn\u2019t use. My 5 year-old son slept on the pullout sofa bed, and his only complaint was that the clock on the wall above him kept him awake. He said the bed was comfortable. We enjoyed the free buffet breakfast every morning, which offered different hot selections like eggs/omelets, bacon, ham, and sausage, as well as cereal, toast, muffins, donuts and a waffle maker. The food was good, and none of us had any complaints or problems.

I bought some snacks from the shop and thought it was a bit pricy ($4 for a bag of Doritos and a 20 oz. Diet Coke).

We also noticed there was a medical clinic across the street, which is good to know should an emergency arise. My father took my one son to the pool one day and said it was nice and clean (and warm).

The biggest negative on this stay is that I requested a two bedroom suite and only got a one bedroom. As you will notice on previous reviews you can only get to the bathroom in a one bedroom suite through the bedroom. It makes it difficult in the middle of the night.

Rooms and linens are kept extremely well for the age of this property. The amount of people from other countries make this a wonderful place to make interesting and amazing new friends.

Giordonnos (spelling?) in the mall across the street has wonderful deep dish pizzas. You can not beat the location of this property! Negatives- The pool is kept warm so the need for chlorine is greater- make sure your kids have goggles (really inexpensive goggles available in the mall across the street). Most of the breakfast food is really bad (scrambled eggs, meats, etc.). Rely on waffles and fresh fruit to fuel your day.

The location is great with lots of restaurants close by. There is even a liquor store, and grocery store right across the street. The location is also very convenient for Disney World, which is just 1 exit up on the I-4. The room: The rooms are dated but we understand that they are going to be renovating them in the next year. The room was sufficient size for me, my husband, and our 3 year old son. We really appeciated having the kitchen with dishwasher, fridge, and stove. The one thing I didn't like about the room is that the bathroom is connected to the bedroom. That meant that if we were taking a shower at night, my son couldn't fall asleep until we were done and if we showered in the morning, he was awoken by the shower and fan. Definitely made it hard to get up early and get myself ready before everyone else got up. Although the room did seem clean, we did come across a couple of huge beetles(cockroaches?) on our last day. Because it was late on our last day, we didn't tell hotel staff about our findings. However, I have no doubt that they would have switched us to another room if we had told them (I've since emailed them to let them know so they can inspect and treat the room). The staff actually phoned us a couple of times during our stay to make sure everything was going well - we were very impressed with the level of service received during our stay. Buffet Breakfast - We enjoyed having the buffet breakfast. It saved us the time and money of going to eat in a restaurant. I think the food offered is more than enough - they have waffles, eggs (scrambled or omelets), bacon, sausage, or ham, yogurt, fruit, cereal, toast, bagels, muffins, juices, coffee, tea, and milk. Hotel grounds - as someone else mentioned, the grounds are very clean. They have a nice seating area beside the pool area. The pool itself is a reasonable size. We were there during off season so it wasn't too busy. I'd be interested in seeing this hotel once it's all renovated. The only suggestion I would make is if possible, try to reconfigure the rooms so the bathroom is not located within the bedroom.

We were greeted on the main desk by Melissa and another of the hotel staff, what a welcome they had remembered my email without me mentioning it and that we were on a trip for our anniversary, check in was quick and we were shown to our room, we already knew there were no lifts but I had asked for top floor but even so they offered assistance with the cases. on arrival at our room we were so pleasantly surprised, we had been given a pool view 3rd floor two bedroom suite. The space was amazing a great little fully equiped kitchen, lounge area with dining table and chairs a master bedroom with a huge king size bed, dressing area and bathroom and another bedroom with two double beds dressing area and another bathroom. How anyone can complain about this I will never know, ok some of the kitchen bits are a lttle older but so what the whole place was lovely. ( and they are about to completely renovate the suites in a few months for those of you that are really fussy) The whole hotel was beautifully kept there were cleaners inside and out all the time the gardeners were keeping the grounds every day we were there and they were lovely grounds. The pool was cleaned evey day and was lovely as was the spa. There was a small air conditioned gym and games room. A business centre with computers and free internet (WiFi was free in all the rooms too) Breakfast was free daily and would vary from day to day.. Scrambled egg and either Bacon, Sausage or Ham. There was yohgarts fruit and cereals, muffins bagels toast. in separate area you could make your own waffles with a selection of waffle machines and porridge. (Included in the price really yes! ample foods to start your day) My only thing and its really not a complaint it is mearly a comment would be the cleaners come in to do a mini clean each day and once a week a full clean of the suites but you never know when they will be coming one day it may be early in the morning another maybe 5pm in the afternoon and when you are just coming back from a long day at the parks sometimes not what you would want. Another comment that may help We loved our Pool View room but bear in mind it is open till 11pm at night and there is noise from children and families till that time ( it didnt affect us one bit) Having said that This place is amazing, we will be back and will bring our children next time so spacious, great suites fab hotel lovely people a really pleasant holiday give it a go you really wont be disappointed here....

This place is on the doorstep to Disney and 15 minutes from all the other non Disney attractions for which this hotel gives you lots of information about when you check in - a lovely touch was the information sheets that the hotel has put together for all driving guests which had all the addresses of virtually everything you wanted to do for your car SatNav, all Disney, Universal, Seaworld theme parks as well all the restaurants you can imagine locally of which there was many to choose from, including the supermarkets and shopping outlets. Another nice touch was on our last day due to a late flight back home, they let us have the suite until 2.30pm instead of having to vacate at 11am at no extra charge.

The breakfast as other reviewers have said was a great start to the day - eggs, bacon, bagels, make your own waffle station, pastries, fruit, juices etc. There was something to suit everyone. There are Styrofoam cups if you want a take away cup of coffee and paper plates and bowels to bring cereal or pastries back to your room. We did this a couple of mornings when the older kids slept in. The last time we stayed we didnt attend any sundowners Tues, Wed and Thurs 5 - 7pm) but this time we did and I have to say they were great. It was a really good way to meet other people staying at the hotel and I was surprised that the food was so good particularly on the \"Cook Out\" nights. Pool area nice with plenty of sunbeds and towels. A couple of times they ran out of towels but they were replaced very quickly. There are plenty of pool toys available to keep the kids occupied. A bit of music around the pool area would have been nice though. There is a games room with arcade games, at a cost, and a computer. My teenager loved this for checking up with friends at home. We used the computers in the business centre to arrange car hire and found this very useful. A couple of times it was difficult to get at the computers in here though as there were teenagers using them to go on facebook. No under 18s are allowed to use the computers in this room but no one seemed to be monitoring it. It is only a small issue anyway. We didnt use the shuttle buses this holiday so I cant comment on them only to say that when we stayed in 2009 we used them all the time and found the service excellent. I am nearly finished - I know this is a long review, sorry. One of the main reasons we picked the Staybridge LBV on our first visit and again this time is the location. 10 minutes to disney and 25 to universal. Also for those evening when you aren't in the park there are ample restaurants within walking distance. Orlando Ale House and Olive Garden are two I would highly recommend. Winn Dixie and Walgreens are also within 3 minute walk.

Im an experienced traveller both to Orlando for holidays and to the USA in general for work and have stayed in various big name Hotels and on site at Disneyworld so wasnt expecting huge things from this more moderatly priced hotel but have to say everything about it was spot on. We arrived on the Saturday after thanksgiving and was quickly given our room after being given a little bag of cookies. We were asked by a lady on the opposite desk if we were interested in discount park tickets but said we were sorted and were sent on our way with a smile, no hard sell. The suite itself was on the 3rd floor facing the pool. I was aware that there were no elevators so expected to have to carry the cases up, but its only once up and once down so no hardship. If your party isnt able to do this im sure the guys at front desk would be happy to help. The suite had everything we needed, nice little kitchen, comfy lounge area with a good sized TV, nice bedroom and clean and well layed out bathroom. It was the little extras that made it for me though like the free in room safe and the free wi-fi. In the morning we did notice that one of the plug sockets was damaged and let front desk know. When we returned that evening it was fixed and we had a message apologising, there really was no need but nice touch. We made use of the free breakfast buffet about half the time we were there, its not as good as going to Dennys or Perkins for breakfast but theres plenty to choose from and if youre on a budget a great way to start the day. The hot food wasnt great but the pastries and coffee were lovely and i loved making myself a fresh waffle with maple syrup. It was a little chilly when we went but we did manage to use the pool a couple of times, its lovely and clean. Even at this time of year we saw the friendly maintenance folks cleaning the pool daily, it really was spotless. During our stay we had a weekend at Clearwater at the Hilton hotel and despite the Hilton being great we loved coming back to our little home from home. Location wise you couldnt ask for me, its a 10 minute drive to the Disney Parks, 15 mins to Universal and 5 mins to Seaworld. There is a shuttle bus to the parks but we had a car so never used it, it didnt seem too full when we saw it outside but again it was a quiet time of year. There are several restaurants in walking distance, we loved Chilli's for a nice no frills meal with a nice cold beer and Giordannos across the road does awesome chicago style stuffed Pizzas. There is also Joe's crab shack, Sizzler, Dennys, Black Angus and a few others in walking distance and you have Crossroads plaza a 2 minute drive away with lots of other eating spots including the awesome Sweet Tomatoes. There is a wallgreens near the hotel and a Winn Dixie out the back, i found the Winn Dixie to be much quieter and friendlier than Walmart and not much more expensive. Theres also so fast food take away places next to the Winn Dixie that would be good for a quiet night in with a pizza or chinese. Overall i have to say this is probably the best place ive stayed at in Orlando, beating the Disney hotels for convenience and value hands day and at least equal to the higher end off site hotels ive stayed at like the Wyndham resort and Hilton Garden inn in terms of service and quality of stay.

The hotel consists of a series of three story buildings ( about 12?) and our room was on the third floor facing the parking lot. Since we spent most of our time at Universal, it was suitable for us. Probably this hotel works better for Disney visitors since Disney is much closer than Universal. They do provide a shuttle to Disney which we found to be unreliable on our first visit 2 years ago Hopefully it is better now. The breakfast was filling but only a few hot entrees were served. Make your own Belgian waffles were available and delicious.

The room was as described and far better than a regular hotel room. Bedroom was large with doors that closed off. This is honestly the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in, and we have travelled a fair bit! Check in was smooth, we were even 2 1/2 hours early and our room was ready! It was the first week after kids were back in school so the hotel was fairly quiet for the first 2 nights, not a bad thing in Orlando!! Plenty of space with a full size frodge/freezer and icemaker. didn't use the kitchen as there are many decent restaurants within a few minutes walking dostance, I never want to cook on holiday anyway, but the kitchen is handy if required. Room view was poor, we were in the 1800 building which overlooked our parking area.. No private balcony was a downside, but the only one I can think of. breafast is free and decent, the coffee is very good! Sundownwer 3 nights of the week included food, beer and wine, we enjoyed a couple of free bevereges each evening! Smoking is allowed in certain areas but not in the pool area ( nor are alcoholic drinks). We found the hotel more than adequate for our short stay and are planning on staying there again with family in one of the 2 bedroom rooms.

Pros.. It is very close to Disney.. Sea World, Universal are easy to get to. The room is comfortable with two beds, almost like a small apartment since there is a wall with a doorway that separates the two rooms. Room had a full size fridge, a full sized oven, microwave, plates and silverware. Room also had a safe; it was easy to use and there was no additional charge for using it. There is also a Winn Dixie supermarket within walking distance (be sire and ask for a free WInn Dixie card on your first visit). The breakfast was always good; eggs each morning and the meat available was either ham, bacon or sausage. Waffle makers, cold cereal muffins and doughnuts, milk juice and coffee. The breakfast area is staffed so they were never out of anything. Everyone in our family found something they liked. The pool was nice and is shaded in the hot afternoons. Cons... we did see a cockroach.. but we are from the south (Texas), and we have seen them before. Some people are put off by them so I figured I would mention it. The free shuttle was jam packed. Standing room only...no joke. We only used it the first day and we drove to the parks the rest of the time. Yes, we paid to park, but the parking pass is good for all of the parks all day long.

As a member of the family of hotels' loyalty program, for us, it was a no brainer: free breakfast, a two-room, 2 full-bath, full-kitchen suite for $100/night plus tax...and only minutes away from Disney attractions. Throw-in a package deal: 7 nights for the price of 5 and 6 days of Disney park passes for the price of four, and this is hard to beat. But, you have to be prepared for a bit of 'rough around the edges.' Trim everywhere on the exterior needed a new coat of paint or completely repaired due to central Florida's relatively brutal heat and humidity. We found small areas required stucco repair, and some wood trim was visibly deteriorating. Previous reviews we have read noted the carpets in the rooms appeared dirty. I cannot disagree. Housekeeping could've been better. Rooms have coffee service in them, though, with a free breakfast, I never had a need to use it. However, we just happen to inspect the service and found that there were only de-caffeinated coffee packs available, and a used coffee filter pack still in the coffee maker from the last guest. Yuck. Throughout our stay, this coffee service was never re-supplied. There is a form for you to list any thing in the room that needs attention. I noted the wall clock in the common sitting area was not working(dead battery?) . The form appeared to have been collected by housekeeping, but I never saw the clock fixed nor was there any mention made by hotel staff of having received my note. Also points off for the dryers in the laundry area. $1.50 per load and our clothes were as wet as if they just came out of the wash machine. Another guest had the same experience as us as we were washing at the same time. The pool and the jacuzzi were fine, though we used it only 2-3 times during our week stay. I assume the pool uses one of those salt-based chlorinators as there was a definite salty taste to the water (yeah right, you try and keep pool water out of your mouth when you swim!). Otherwise, the pool water did appear clean. The lobby was clean and inviting. The free breakfast was great. One step above what you would find in a Holiday Inn Express or similar. It was actually more of a buffet, with two serving lines. As the hotel is comprised of several 3-story buidlings around a large court yard, which includes the pool, laundry service building and a covered veranda area, there are no elevators, just external stairs. If you cannot 'do stairs' I recommend informing the hotel at the time you are making reservations. A Winn-Dixie supermarket and a liquour store is literally across the street making use of the suite's kitchen a very easy alternative to expensive restaurant fare. Downtown Disney is only minutes a way by car, and not difficult to get to either. There are money quality eateres nearby, too. While the hotel offers FREE bus transportation to all Disney parks, it isn't the best. You can't complain though, since it is free. At one point it took us an hour to get from Epcot back to our hotel as the bus route also services at least two other hotels in the area. For the morning trips to the parks, as our hotel was the last on the route, it was standing room only...and I must believe some had to be left behind as there was eventually no more room. After the second or third day, we drove ourselves to the parks, forking over the $14/day parking. Admittedly it was due to an injury requiring crutches and a wheelchair, but I must believe we would have eventually decided to drive on our own as did one family sans injury because of the amount of time it took to get to and from the parks otherwise. The schedule of pick up and return to the hotel is also a bit limited. Overall, if you are on a Disney adventure and don't want to stay at a Disney property because of the cost, this is a great choice. Since you won't be doing much more than sleeping and eating breakfast here, going for something more expensive is truly a waste of money, IMO. The hotel, however, needs to invest a bit of money in this money maker to keep it up to Disney quality.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Heidelberg, Germany", "Title": "\u201cgood budget hotel with minor problems\u201d", "Author": "PaddySch", "ReviewID": "UR78319470", "Content": "Pros: 88 USD for a hotel with Breakfast, Disney Shuttle (all parks), 4 times a week Dinner and a one bedroom.

There are 3 tv's, free wifi, a full cooker, large fridge, safe, iron and ironing board, two hairdryers, and loads of storage space. There are 2 bathrooms. The breakfast is included and there's a great choice, so if you're going to Theme Parks you are not hungry again till late afternoon. With 5 of us, the rate was so good, my son said you would hardly get a hostel as cheap if you divided the nightly rate by 5. There is a business centre which we used to print off airline tickets, and no charge for that. There is a swimming pool and jacuzzi and a gym I think although we didn't use it. The hotel is literally around the corner from Disney and about 15 minutes in the car from Universal. There is a free courtesy bus to Disney and also to the outlets but we had hired a car so we used the car anyway. There is a great Walmart on Turkey Lake Road, open 24 hours and with a McDonalds in it as well, but there is a Walgreens and a Wine Dixie beside the hotel. Also there are lots of restaurants nearby. The beauty of this hotel is that there is so much room in the suites that everybody has their own space. The room was cleaned everyday with fresh towels, toiletries etc. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Orlando. I think it's an all round great hotel, in a great location, and so much space for everyone that you don't get the normal teenage arguing at all. On a visit about 10 years ago we rented a house in Kissamee but it was too far out and you had a long drive every night after the theme parks. Our flight was an evening flight so we were able to leave our suitcases in a locked room in the reception area and go back later for them. There is a huge parking area, free of charge.

So, every day when we came back the beds were made, we had fresh towels and the room was ready to go another round with us. The breakfast was awesome. We didn't pay to go to breakfast once. That saved us lots of $. Don't expect steak and eggs or an omelet station or anything. Juice, milk, cereal, scrambled eggs, a meat, toast, oatmeal, waffles, great coffee, tea. Coffee is out 24 hrs a day too. It's great to just go downstairs together or just whenever you're ready. Also, during the week the staff will bbq burgers and/or dogs and put out chips, beer, soda. So we saved again there because there were 2 nights that we didn't even have to go out for dinner. It's a short walk to the drug store, olive garden, mcdonalds, many fast food places to choose from. There's a computer room, a game room, a laudry room. It's pretty much like home. Just like some other reviews, my small complaint was the carpet was older and somewhat dirty.

We loved the hotel in general. We saw it's high rating on TripAdvisor and liked the fact that it had plenty of space for a family. Traveled with 6 people, three adults and three teens. Check-in was smooth and trouble-free and the staff were very friendly and helpful. We were given some coupons for nearby restaurants upon check-in and invited to the free daily breakfast and afternoon reception (held Tues, Weds and Thurs evenings). The hotel is a \"WDW Good Neighbor Hotel\", meaning you can buy Disney tickets here (though not necessarily at discounts). Hotel's location is outstanding. It is located just off Apopka-Vineland Road, just a couple miles north of I-4 exit 68. This road is somewhat of a tourist strip, but the hotel is not located in the busy section. Downtown Disney's entrance is 5 minutes or less away, and Universal and Sea World are no more than 10 minutes up I-4. You are really no more than 15 minutes away from any Disney location or park. The hotel is not smack on top of other hotels like some in this area; it is located by itself in a very quiet area, although everything you need is just minutes away, including several sit-down restaurants, fast food, and a grocery store (Winn-Dixie). If you're flying in from Orlando Airport, expect maybe a 25 minute drive to the hotel. We didn't encounter any problems during our stay. The rooms were VERY spacious, with a huge living room and two bedrooms, each with their own bathroom, which was wonderful. The bathrooms themselves are pretty small, however, but we didn't mind too much. The sink and counter is located outside of the bathroom.

Tuesday evening they had chinese night with egg rolls and fried rice, Wednesday evening they had a cookout with hot dogs and burgers and Thursday they had chips and salsa.

In addition to the foods, they had beer, wine and soda also free. The only thing I would change is more bus service to/from the theme parks, or at least Downtown Disney. You had a full kitchen to cook, but if you came back to your room for lunch and a swim, you had no way to return to the parks later in the day. We chose to use our car which made the travel to/from the parks fast and easy, However, you must pay $14 per day for parking at Disney if staying off property.

So we already had a certain expectation. The only negative is that it appears that the general infrastructure of the suites is lacking from our previous trip. The living and dining area in our suite was dirty and in need of refurbishment. We frequently had blackened feet and dirty socks from the carpet. However, as a place to crash at the end of the day it was acceptable. There was a serious pipe leak that put the small fitness room out of use and caused loud air dryers to be placed throughout the dining/reception area. Our room didnt get the attention that we had previously. On two occasions our room was not prepared and frequently rubbish not removed. I suspect that as with all of the travel industry the reccession has hit hard and perhaps their renovation and/or cleaning schedule has been affected. The maids seemed constantly busy working long hours, perhaps their numbers have been cut? The positives outweigh the negatives though. The location is great, Disney nearby, Universal a 10 minute drive (take Vineland Apopka Road, Sandlake then Turkey Lake to miss the Interstate (4) traffic). The I4 is 5 min drive and easy to access. Plenty of places to eat, Joes Crab Shack, Chillis, Red Lobster and various other family friendly restaraunts withinin walking distance. Winn Dixie supermarket is over the road which we found invaluable for snacks, drinks and stuff for our 2 1/2 year old. Parking is great easy to get to rooms and always available. The staff, in particular the breakfast team are very friendly and helpful. The pool is ideal for kids and was frequently busy up to about 1030 at night. Breakfast was ideal for setting us up for the day... not sure what people mean about lack of choice??? Cereal, fruit, juices, coffee, tea, eggs, meat, yogurts, waffles, muffins, toast, bagels, porridge..... What more would you really want? Lack of choice seriously???? We always enjoy the reception on a tues-thurs providing beer wine and nibbles... great to sit outside in the quiet courtyard after a day of chasing the kid around the parks. Beds are a real plus, big and really comfortable. Two TV's! Point to note....Keep kids away from the two lakes in front of the hotel however!

We live in Florida and travel to Disney multiple times a year with our two children (9 & 11). Over the years we have tried many locations in and around Disneyworld. The Marriott Village is too busy and has no character, the people are rude and I feel like a business traveler when staying there. The Holiday Inn SunSpree is dirty old and has no value. Other hotels in the area are commercial and lack the personality that this particular Staybridge Suites has. We have stayed there now on 4 separate occasions and each time we feel like we are at home. The rooms are spotless, the grounds are constantly being kept, there is no noise once you are in the rooms and the respect for each neighbor is given once everyone recognizes the quality of the hotel. The Breakfasts are bountiful and never ending. The game room for the kids is, well its there but not much to it, but we never use it anyway as there is always so much more to do off property. What struck me most about this location is its staff\u2019s attention to details. The second time we stayed there was Easter vacation of 2009. In a politically correct society, this location showed their true character by having the Easter Bunny in the lobby visiting with all of the children on Easter Sunday. I was amazed that a business would do this and elated that this location took the time to show us how much they cared about children on such a religious holiday. We enjoy the Sundowners reception that they have on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays which offers complementary soda, beer and wine along with a small buffet of appetizers, hamburgers or Hotdogs. Parking is safe and free. This hotel is minutes away from Downtown Disney and Typhoon Lagoon as well as the rest of Disneyworld. The frond Desk staff is courteous, kind and most accommodating. The Management staff recognizes the location of the hotel and the vast choices that we as visitors have and make every effort to make themselves memorable. A 2 bedroom, 750 sqft room with a kitchen, 3 TV\u2019s, 2 bathrooms and dining area along with a pull out sleeper sofa if needed is all that anyone can ask for while on vacation.

Let me preface my review by simply stating it was AWESOME! I traveled w/ my wife and family, 2 boys ages 10 & 12 and we stayed in \"tri-suite\" on the third floor overlooking the pool. Having stayed at Disney's Port Orleans French Quarter 2 years prior in basically a motel room, the entire family marveled at the size of our room. We had 2 bedrooms, 1 w/ 2 queens for the boys w/ their own bathroom and television, our room w/ a king, bathroom and television and a large living room(also a television) and kitchenette. The room was spotless and updated. In fact, we had to wait a few hours to check in so the rugs that we cleaned that day could dry properly. Our room was made up daily with fresh towels and I believe on our 4th day it was thoroughly cleaned and linens changed. The whole property is beautiful and the perfect size. Its a three story building that surrounds the pool and courtyard. The grounds are impeccable and the staff could not be more friendly or more helpful. I did my homework and spoke with the manager, Melissa, prior to booking. She was upfront and honest stating that the property was not brand new nor was it a five star hotel. I still booked for a variety of reasons; price, location, ammenities , free breakfast and managers happy hours, and the ability to get a suite. The suite was really great. Having the room to get away from the kids and give them their own space made for great relaxation. We had a perfect view of the pool and the courtyard and pretty much let our kids go. There is a small gameroom w/ 2 kid friendly computers w/ internet access. They also supply some pool toys and plenty of lounge chairs and tables. The whole place had a really \"safe\" feel to it. As far as location, you could not get a more convenient spot. You are literally 5 min. from Downtown Disney and no more than 15 min to any attraction. There are lots of restaurants, many within walking distance as well as a grocery store across the parking lot. I would recommend the Orlando Ale House for food. Big place with lots of T.V.'s , good food, big portions and very reasonable. The hotel has a shuttle but we had a rental car so I can not comment on it. The property is on a service road off a main drag so the road noise was non-existent. The free breakfast was great. I know a lot of reviews say it was repetetive but we found it more than ample. The managers receptions on Tues, Wed and Thurs had beer, wine, hots & burgers and a whole variety of snacks, again all free. We ate outside everyday at an umbrella table and the inside had plenty of seating. The kids could even make their own Belgian waffles. We saved a lot of time and money starting our day with a good meal and in beautiful surroundings. In conclusion, I wish everything I researched so hard came out so good. I would go back in a second and would highly recommend the place to anyone, especially families. Do yourself a favor and go online and get an Orlando Magicard. I think I saved about $60.00 a night and all you have to do is mention it. We traveled 3 nights in the prime season and 5 nights after prime and my total bill was $1340.00 If I had one criticism it would be that the pool was too warm.

Chose this hotel based on reviews and was not disappointed. The location is spot on - only a 5 minute drive to Disney and 15 - 20 minutes to Universal. What I particularly liked about the location was the fact that you could leave your hotel and walk places, not always having to drive everywhere. There is a Walgreens and Winn Dixie both within a few minutes walk and an abdunance of restaurants also within walking distance. I would highly recommend the Orlando Ale House. We stayed in a two bed suite and with five of us there was plenty of space. One bedroom had a queen size bed ad the other had two doubles. It was great having two bathrooms. Kitchen was well stocked, not that we used it a lot. Suite itself was a little jaded, looked like it was time for a coat of paint and some new furnishings. That said it was clean and had everything we needed - plenty of bedding and towels. Housekeeping came in every day and made beds and brought clean towels and soap, shampoo and shower gel. Dora was our housekeeper and she did a great job. Free breakfast in the morning was great, eggs, bacon, fruit, bagels and a selection of muffins or donuts. Kids especially liked the waffle station. We bought some chococlate syrup and took this down to breakfast with us every day. There are plastic plates and bowls for anyone who wish to take breakfast back to their room. There is a managers sundowner three times per week with complimentary food and beer or wine and sodas. We went one evening for a short time and it seemed to be very good. Business centre with free use of computers came in very handy for hiring car. Pool area was great with plenty of towels and beds. My only complaint was that the water in the pool was too hot - dont really think you need heated pools in Florida heat! First week there we didnt hire a car and took the shuttles to Disney Parks and found the service to be excellent. First 2 nights we rushed from parks after fireworks thinking we would miss bus back to hotel but then realised we had plenty of time, so don't rush they give you sufficient time. Anyone going to Disney for the first time I cannot recommend enough staying for fireworks or parade at the end of the day - it is the icing on the cake.

Game room is great for kids, there is even a computer in there for online games. We went back for one night Oct 29th to go to Halloween Horror nights at Universal, got our same room, and the boys walked in like they were home again. We are going back again, this time our stay was only 99 for the night! Fl resident discount, and if you are priority club, they give you choc chip macadamia nut cookies when you check in.

The room was very dated, but seemed clean. The carpet was pretty worn, but didn't seem dingy. The bathrooms were very clean! One BR had two full sized beds, the other had a King; each had its own bathroom. There was a small furnished kitchenette which we didn't use. The breakfast was decent. Nothing spectacular, but it was free and had some nice variety, including freshly made waffles and a different meat each day. On weeknights, there is apparently a free manager's reception with beer, wine and soft drinks, along with some appetizer type things, but we didn't make any of those, either. For you techies: I had trouble staying connected to the wi-fi, but it was free when I could. The rooms are wired for high speed, but I didn't have an ethernet cable. There were three tube tvs in the room, but the picture was pretty poor due to a lousy setup.

We stayed here for seven nights and the location to all the Disney parks is perfect - just a mile up the road from Downtown Disney and the same road will take you to all the parks in minutes. You can take the complimentary shuttle bus from the hotel, which we did one day and it was fine, I prefer not to have to worry about the bus schedule. There are a variety of restaurants and stores right accross the street. This is an excellent location! We reserved a two bedroom king suite, which was more than comfortable for two adults and two kids (11 & 14) for the same price we would have paid for a moderate room on Disney property. The boys had their own room with their own beds, bathroom and TV and we had our own room, bathroom and TV. The living room was comfortable with a sofa bed (if you need it), lounge chair, TV with DVD and VCR player. The fully equiped kitchen and dining area were perfect for our needs and there is free internet service in each room. The room was very clean and housekeeping came in every day to make beds and replace towels and soaps. They come in every third day for a full cleaning. The one thing I would recommend is trying to get a first floor room if you have a lot of luggage because there are 3 levels and no elevators so you have to carry your luggage up yourself. We requested a first level pool view room, which was a great location for the kids, but if you prefer peace and quiet, stay away from the pool side of the hotel - it can get a bit busy at times. The hotel has an arcade, with computer, a laundry room, business center with computers, gym and a library. The pool was very nice with a toddler pool, full size pool and a jacuzzi with fresh towels always available. The staff was very friendly and accomodating to any of our needs. The complimentary breakfast each morning was great, with a wide variety of breakfast foods and drinks for just about anyones taste. There is an evening reception with free food and drinks three nights a week.

Now this is 'Orlando' and full of tourest and kids and so is the hotel. But the good thing is they leave about 9 a.m. for the parks and don't return until late. So you almost have the pool to yourself if you want to relax at the hotel. The buffet breakfast is good. It comes with the price of the room and you should find something on it to start your day. The only problem I encouter is when they have scrambled eggs, I wish they would cook them more. The cook must like runny eggs, I don't. Now the rooms are starting to show some wear but they are kept clean and room service does a good job. Unless you want to pay a lot more to stay in a 5 Star Hotel stay here. Well worth the money.

It was just perfect as far as we were concerned. There are 2 large bedrooms, one with a kingsize bed and the other with 2 doubles. There is also a sofa bed. We have 3 teenage children and had plenty of room. There are 2 bathrooms, 2 hairdryers, 3 tvs, a roomsafe, an iron and ironing board and a kitchen with a full size cooker, huge fridge and microwave. There is free internet access in the suite. We brought our laptop and the kids were able to go on MSN, BEBo etc. Our suite was spotless. There were fresh towels and beds made every day. There was bath soap, face soap and shampoo renewed every day. I thought the furnishings were lovely. There is a kitchen table also. Normally our kids fight on hols if we are in a small living area but there were no arguments at all what with the 3 tvs and the internet access. There is a courtesy bus to the Disney parks - we were given the schedule when we checked in. The breakfast has a good choice. They have paper plates for people who want to take away the breakfast. A few days when the kids slept late we brought up cereal and pastries to the room for them which was very handy. The pool area was lovely, a big pool, a small for toddlers and a jacuzzi. There are loads of loungers and plenty of fresh towels at the pool for everyone. The hotel is literally a two minute drive from Disney World. A tip when you're coming out of the Disney Parks - head for the Downtown Disney area and that road takes you out to the exit near the hotel. For Universal take a left onto Apopka Vineland Ave (outside the hotel) and then the next left up Palm Parkway. This road becomes Turkey Lake Road and there is an entrance to Universal on that road. There is also a Walmarts on Turkey Lake Road, but there is a Walgreens just outside the hotel. There are loads of restaurants just outside also. I can highly recommend the Pizza Hut just around the Corner on Palm Parkway, the food is great, very cheap and the staff are lovely. There is also a great takeaway pizza place - there is a card on the worktop. We go abroad every year mainly to the States as my husband works for an airline. With 3 teenagers we are classed as 5 adults so accommodation is always expensive but we try to get it for a reasonable rate. We got a special on this hotel as they were giving a one bedroomed suite for the price of a two offer when we were enquiring. We also booked the Disney tickets. A tip - the difference between a 3 day and 5 day Disney pass is only 10 dollars in total - 5 dollars per day so it's worth getting the 5 day one. With Universal when we were buying a 2 day pass at the park they offered us a pass for a week for an extra 5 dollars each so we took that as well! Entry to Disney and Universal is by card (ticket) and fingerprint so don't mix up the tickets or they won't match with your fingerprints when you enter. For anyone new to Disney the hopper pass means you can go between the parks and Disney have courtesy buses that go park to park all day. If you are shopping what used to be the Belz Mall is now the Orlando Prime Outlets. It's good. There are other outlets - Orlando Premium Outlets - we found them expensive. There are small outlets a short drive from the hotel - Lake Buena Vista outlets and we found them pretty good. In summary I can highly recommend this hotel. It's got everything you need in it and also it's in a great location for everything. The area is safe and also the hotel is very quiet. I can honestly say that we loved it.

What we probably liked the best was the fact that it's really close to everything. I could litteraly walk to the Winn-Dixie and back with 4 bags of groceries, it's THAT close. (I used the car, but I could have walked! Ha...) There is a Walgreens right accross the street and many restaurants nearby. Sea World and Disney Parks are maybe 10mins away. Close enough that on a few occasions, we left the park around lunch, grabbed lunch at the hotel, then went back to another park after a rest. The pool area is ok. Nothing fancy, but clean, nice, no issues. They supply pool toys for the kids. We did get room service everyday (I think if you stay 7 days or more, you get daily, if not, it's as required). We did have to purchase dishcloths and perhaps more dishwasher detergent if we wanted to run it daily. But these are really no big deal. We had a 2nd floor suite (there are 3 floors) and for the first few nights, I think we had a family upstairs of us that were playing Wii like all night. Anyhow, I would suggest perhaps a top floor room if you really want to avoid issues like this.", "Date": "July 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "lewis center,oh", "Title": "\u201cLOADS OF ROOM BUT BRING YOUR OWN TOILETRIES!\u201d", "Author": "spike90", "ReviewID": "UR33276025", "Content": "I, along with my elderly parents and 11 year old stayed here for 4 nights during our visit to Orlando.

This hotel takes them all (used or not) and does not replace them. After calling the front desk everyday for towels were got to know our housekeeping lady very well. She was extremly friendly and would always apologize when bringing the towels up. She did speak English but didn't seem to understand it, but she was trying. The beds were made up the first night and that was it. She did come in on our last day to vacuum. This hotel needs to improve on their toiletries and on having rooms done daily. We also got to know the maintenance man as one of the vanity lights needed replaced due to a shortage of something. He was also very friendly and fixed it right up.

There was a large gap under the room's door which allowed plant debris from the courtyard to blow in under the door. There are at least 50 cable TV channels to watch including the local Weather Channel feed which should keep kids entertained when not out.

There are some inflatable pool toys for the kids to play with, and plenty of lounge chairs and tables. Breakfast was a good variety of hot and cold items, coffee, sodas, juice, fruit, and so forth. There are also several restaurants within a 5 minute walking distance. Across the street you will find Sizzlers, Steak-n-shake, Giordanos, etc. And behind the hotel (another 5 minute walk) there is a Papa John's pizza, an ice cream shop, and a Winn Dixie grocery store which is perfect for buying bottled water and other necessities. We used the free shuttle service to the parks for both pick up and return. The bus was very comfortable and stops at all 4 Disney parks. You will receive a shuttle schedule upon check in. Make sure you are at the bus stop at least 5 minutes before pick up. The bus comes on time (sometimes a couple minutes early) and it will not wait for you. It picks up whoever is there and takes off without waiting 5 or 10 minutes, etc. So if you're not there, you will be left behind. A word of advice about return times. The Animal Kingdom closed at 5:00 and the bus didn't arrive until 6:15, so for an hour we basically stood in the parking lot waiting. With the Magic Kingdom, the park closed at 9:00 with fireworks ending between 9:15 - 9:20. The bus pickup was at 9:30, so this left little time to get to the parking lot. We were literally running to get there. ( After a long day and tired feet, this was quite painful!) So if you use the shuttle for the return trip from the Magic Kingdom, make sure you are near the front gate when the fireworks are presented and then make a beeline to the monorail as soon as they are over. Skip the express monorail! Everyone goes there and you will end up in a line. Go straight to the resort monorail and you will get right on. The 2nd stop is the TTC and that is where you will find the bus. If you don't do this, you will most likely end up in a Taxi instead of the bus. Downtown Disney is less than 10 minutes away but it is not within walking distance. We took a cab for $12 each way. The hotel lobby will call a taxi for you so you don't have to arrange that yourself. When you're ready to leave for the return trip, you will find many taxis waiting outside the Marketplace and West Side so it is easy to get a ride with no problem. Overall our family enjoyed our stay at this hotel and we will certainly book it again if we return to the Disney area.", "Date": "October 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cCould be cleaner\u201d", "Author": "Adir0ndack", "ReviewID": "UR20545591", "Content": "Recently stayed based on excellent location.

The bathtub was old and the faucets were corroded. The towels were thin and not top quality. The kitchen cabinets were very old. The garbage disposal was right out in the open under the sink.... nothng even anything covering it. Our carpet was wet, due to the fact that they had just cleaned it prior to our arrival, so we had to wear shoes or our feet got soaked. NO ELEVATORS POOL: The pool was nice and it was clean. But the tiles around the jacuzzi were starting to flake. I'm not sure if it was paint or tile finish flaking away, but it was unattractive. Pool seemed warm and Jacuzzi was HOT! The courtyard in the very center of te hotel made for a great ambiance. very relaxing. BREAKFAST: I will say that the Breakfast was Good. Alot of variety and probably the biggest and best \"free\" breakfast I have ever incountered at any hotel I have stayed at. I did notice, and no offense, there were many Europeans staying at this hotel. Their standards are very different from American standards, they tend to vacation much longer then Americans, therefore they like this type of \"apartment\" hotel.

The breakfast was great ( some have said it's repetetive - but how many different things do you eat for breakfast at home !!) The choices are - either scambled egg or omlete with either bacon- sausage burger or ham, always a choice of cereal, fruit juices, bread, yogurt,grated cheese, boiled eggs, fresh fruit and tea & coffee ( wolfgang puck - fab !)and muffins, cake ,dohnuts or cinammon whirls.

The room was very clean on arrival but the standards of replenishing the goodies ( eg popcorn) fell rapidly as the stay wore on. It then improved when we handed a $30 tip to the chambermaid ( Us brits loathe this US habit). Room/suite This was very spacious with a king size bed for us and a double each for our teenage sons. The bath was a bit small and could be hard to get out of especially for my wife who has arthritis of the knees. There was a kitchen ( stock somewhat spartan) a very large US size fridge as well as a cooker and microwave. A toaster was also present and a coffee maker but no keetle ( is this a British item?). We ate out most of the time but feel we would have struggled to fix a full meal here. Air con good and can be controlled to a level that suits the occupant with ease. Swimming pool Good size with jacuzzi. Open till 11pm which was great on coming back from a day at the parks. Other facilities. Good hot buffet breakfast included in room rate. There was a business centre with 3 free internet terminals and signs in English and Spanish ( lots of South Americans staying here) advising that there was a maximum use of 15 minutes at a time and strictly no under 18's ( they had their own single terminal in the games' room).

Having two separate bedrooms and 2 baths worked perfectly. I would say that although I didn't think the suite or furnishings were \"worn\", the pull-out sofa bed had a caved in mattress. Not unlike most hotel sofa beds however. We had my 13 year old nephew sleep there, so he didn't really care. We had a 2nd floor room overlooking the pool which was great to watch other family members while at the pool. The pool is adequate...not very big as others stated, but it was very clean and had nice sitting areas as well as a hot tub. Even though we were visiting at a busy time, we literally had the pool area to ourselves at 10am in the morning. The free breakfast was wonderful! Hot items such as the fresh waffles and omelettes were a nice touch. My sister saved a ton of money not having to pay for breakfast for her family of 5. We literally filled up before heading out to Epcot. The parks are literally one exit away, so it is VERY convenient if you have your own transportation. If you plan to stay here, I would suggest becoming a Priority Club member first (it's free) before booking. As a Priority Club member, I received a basket of homemade cookies upon arrival as well as top notch attention. It also didn't hurt that I was wearing my \"TripAdvisor\" baseball cap during check-in! At first, the master bedroom toilet wasn't flushing properly and we also noticed the 2nd bathroom was missing shampoo and conditioner, but both were remedied IMMEDIATELY when I called down to the front desk. Literally, maintanence was at our door within 3 minutes and took care of everything so I can't complain about that. Oh, but their shampoo/conditioner product was horrible! So, I do suggest you bring your own. I never had so many tangles in my life! Anyway, the location can't be beat...many stores and restaurants are located in very close proximity...some even walkable. There is a grocery store, a couple restaurants, and a nice ice cream parlour right behind the hotel. Unfortunately, this hotel doesn't have elevators, so be sure to request a ground floor if anyone in your party cannot do the stairs. Overall, I definitely plan to stay there again.

You are right down the street from the Downtown Disney entrance to the WDW Resort. This entrance has less traffic and is often easier to access than Maingate. You can also catch Disney Buses right at Downtown Disney if you like. Staybridge Suites is less than 2 minutes from this WDW entrance. This hotel is not fancy but we have always found it to be clean and comfortable. The layout of the suite is ideal as we are often traveling with friends.

Our kids loved the pool, kiddie pool, fountain and hot tub almost to the point of annoyance because often they complained about touring the parks and just wanted to stay and swim! We stayed on the second floor overlooking the peaceful courtyard. This was convenient because when our kids would nap my husband and I could go down and play cards/read the paper/whatever and still keep an eye on our door. If we return, I would request the third floor however, because we could hear our upstairs neighbors plumbing and pipes in the morning while we were still in bed.

An open plan kitchen area, a 3 seater sofa bed, a seperate chair and a dining table and chairs. The bedrooms are on opposite sides which is useful for some privacy! The main bedroom had a huge double bed, with en suite fittings, TV, hairdryer, free safe, iron, ironboard and alarm clock. The other bedroom had two small double beds, ensuite and TV but no hairdryer and no safe. Apart from that not much different. All rooms were clean to a good standard, it's not going to satisfy everyones tastes but it satisfied my wife and she is a stickler for cleanliness!

They also provide an egg option and a meat option if you want to. It does get tiresome after a while so we went to IHOP a couple of times. One thing they didn't have was peanut butter! The only spread options seemed to be Mixed fruit jelly, Grape and a few strawberry ones! (Had to hunt for those!) So we brought down our own PB which we brought from Walmarts! Overall though, it was a good breakfast spread. Pool is a bit on the small side. Put it this way, if there's more than 10 people in it, it feels crowded!

We also used the laundry service which was ok, make sure you have plenty of quarters! Maid service was the minimal standard, they did come everyday including weekends which differs to what the notices say, and most of the time they tended to arrive between 4 and 5pm, which was an incovenience, especially when we came back from the parks early! They make the bed, give you clean towels and might put on the dishwasher but there's no hoovering at all and didn't appear to be any cleaning. I guess that is in the once a week full maid service! Whatever you do, do not use the phone! Very expensive to call the UK, I told my friends it wouldn't be cheap but they did it anyway and it cost them $130 for about 20 mins! So be warned!

For Disney waterparks take advantage of using the DisneyWorld Transportation System from the parks which runs throughout Disney itself. We did have to get taxi's to Seaworld and Universal but the taxi's the hotel used were all very reasonable. Our suite itself was very adequate for what we needed, bathroom is a little bit small but the king size bed makes up for that! We did miss not having a kettle in the kitchen, there is a coffee maker but for tea lovers the boiling water from the coffee maker is not nice! Cleaning was adequate but do make use of the \"later please\" sign if you are looking for a lie in as the timings of the cleaner varied alot! The daily breakfast was good but did get a bit boring after a while as normally either scrambled egg and bacon or scrambled egg and sausage! The waffle station is great fun though and there was always a selection of cereals, juice, tea/coffee and pastries/cakes. The hotel does not have a drinks/snack bar or any alcohol beverages, except on Managers sundowner bar b q nights, which is a shame, however there are plenty of restaurants nearby - The Olive Garden is a fab Italian, Hooters is just a bit further to the left of the Olive Garden, TGI Fridays can be found on Crossroads place, and Joes Crabshack is just opposite the hotel. Most nights we were out at the parks anyway! The hotel has a lovely gated pool area where you can swim until 11pm - theres a pool and jacuzzi which is very welcoming on the feet after walking around parks all day. Plenty of sunbeds and towels provided too. The laundry room came in handy but one request i would make is for a folding airer in the suite as there is no where as such to hang your washing that you cant tumble dry! There is also free use of computers and internet for those of you who cant leave checking your emails whilst away!

The other facilities were excellent, from the service from the staff, to the Free breakfast, which was more than adequate, and great waffles, to the Free internet and wifi in the rooms, if you wanted. One draw back at breakfast, no fresh fruit! The pool area was superb, and open until 11pm, which is a welcome break from the heat of Floirda and gives you an opportunity to rest your weary legs. The accommodation is on three floors and is situated around the coutryard pool, which gives a very safe and enclosed sense to the hotel. The utlimate question, would I stay there again and would I recommend it to friends? The answer to both questions is YES, and we did.

Free breakfast every morning and Managers specials during the week which included free beer/wine between 5.30pm/7.30pm. The pool/pool towels were immaculate and lots of inflatables/toys for the children to use. This was my fifth time to Florida (3rd time for my husband and children) and it was the best hotel so far we have stayed in. Brilliant location and right on the doorstep of Walt Disney World. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends. Light Maid service was daily and a complete change of sheets/hoovering was carried out on a Wednesday. We had a king sized comfortable bed in the master room with bathroom and the children had a queen sized bed each with their own bathroom. Lots of wardrobe and drawer space. The staff were very polite and friendly - even the maintenance guys. We viewed lots of hotels before making a decision and it was thanks to TripAdvisor that we picked the Staybridge Suites at Lake Buena Visita as it has glowing reviews - I can now see why! If you are travelling on a budget - this would be ideal as you could take full advantage of the free breakfasts and meals of an evening - all you do is leave gratuity. Lots of restaurants within walking distance - and a huge Walgreens opposite for holiday essentials. We took advantage of the free Internet use in the Games Room - and the children loved playing the arcade games. Also a launderette on site and a shop right next to the reception desk which stays open all the time.

Our flight from Dublin was delayed and by the time we got to the hotel we were under pressure to make the 9pm performance of La Nouba . Check-in was very fast. In and out in less then even 5 minutes with the staff answering some questions for me. I always like a quick check in. Our 2 bedroom suite was a good size. Full size fridge, microwave, dishwasher and cooker. Plenty of towels, replaced daily. Large TV in main room and one in each bedroom. Beds were very comfortable. Ample parking. The morning buffet was fine. Not a lot of change from day-to-day but you don't have that at home anyway. We were very happy with it. The hotel provide disposable cups, plates, bowls and plastic cutlery if you want to take your breakfast on the run. We availed of this a couple of times. Free Wi-Fi seemed to be available everywhere. Rooms have wired and wi-fi. It's a nice option to have this free. I am not a fan of charging for internet access. There is a banner in reception displaying that Staybridge is listed as one of the top 10 family hotels in Orlando (or something similar) I heard one of the staff mention this to a potential customer who dropped by, they seemed to be proud of this. I got the impression that the staff were generally proud of the hotel. I take this as good sign. Location wise the suites are close to everything. One tip when going to the Disney parks other then Typhoon lagoon, Downtown Disney or Cirque is to go via I-4. There is a entrance to Disney less then a mile away via Hotel Plaza Blvd but having to stop for traffic light every couple of hundred meters put me off. There is a 24 hour Walgreen's right across the road from the hotel. There is a large walmart within 5-10 minutes drive. When you are coming out of the hotel on to the main road, turn left and drive straight for 2-3 miles it's on your right (pass under I-4). For what it is. A mid-range spacious family friendly suite complex that is comfortable and safe close to all the attractions, I would give this 5/5.

This is a great place to stay if you need the \"suite ammenities\". We chose a one bedroom suite. It had a king bed, one bathroom, a kitchenette with stove, refriderator, toaster, microwave, and sink. The living area had a sofa bed and tv, and also a dining table area. Our boys slept on the pull out just fine. They are 6 & 9 but if they were older we would have opted for the 2 bedroom. We only ate out \"nice\" one evening and twice lunch in Magic kingdom & Blizzard Beach. The rest of the time the kitchen came in handy and we were able to have snacks, drinks for the kids and for us adults grabbed some beer from winn dixie next door, and sandwich stuff for the rest of the time. The bathroom was a little cramped, it needed about another 2 feet of space in there. It also needed a new shower head, but I find that in most hotels. If they would just stick to a plain ole shower head and avoid the fancy shower massagers they would work better and longer. Other than that it got us cleaned just fine. Breakfast was pretty good and got us to a great start. Eggs, bacon or sasauge, yogurt & granola, cereal, juices, milk, coffee, soda, waffles, muffins, bagels. We arrived late and did not stay during there BBQ evenings but it sounded good. We did not realize how booked the hotel was until our last day when we decided to sleep in (9am). We like to get to the parks early. There were alot of eople at breakfast that day but everything flowed just fine. Pool was small but we were there for the parks not the hotel pool. There was also a hot tub. Very close to DT Disney (5minutes). Close to all of Disney. There was shuttle service to all of these. I did notice that animal kingdom had only one pick up and return but the rest had multiple times. Saved on parking fees! If you are going to universal there is no shuttle service, but I would reccomend a closer hotel to there anyways. I think there is another staybridge closer to that. The hotel staff was ALWAYS smiling and actually seemed like they liked their job. Very nice and willing to answer any questions. We used our reward points to stay but the price is resonable compared to other hotel in the area plus you get breakfast, a kitchen, some shuttle service, and a suite. We would definately stay here again even if we did not have points to used for our stay. Oh I have to tell you this....One day after going to the Magic Kingdom when we got back into our room, our room was not only cleaned but my son's favorite stuffed animal was proudly set up on the pull out bed waiting for him.

I had done an enormous amount of planning for the trip, and was really happy with this place. If you're not staying at any of the Disney hotels, this is a great choice as we found that the hotel is never more than 10 minutes away to any of the 4 WDW parks. You can walk to Walgreen's (across street) or Winn-Dixie (next door). As well, the suites are nicely laid out and although they are not super large - they are more than enough room for a family of four. In fact, our 2 bedroom had a king size bed and 2 doubles, as well as 2 bathrooms, 3 T.V.'s, in-room safe and kitchen with full-size fridge, stove, m/wave, dishwasher and toaster. We found the rooms clean and nicely decorated/furnished. You can request a room right around the pool, but I don't know how noisy it might get (I think the pool is open quite late). Our room was still facing in towards the courtyard but was at the other end opposite the pool, and we liked that just fine as we could easily get to our parked car. However, even though the hotel was operating at full capacity, it was never noisy or overcrowded. Bear in mind there are no elevators, so if you bring a lot of luggage, you may not want to go higher than 2nd floor. The included buffet breakfast was deliciious! There's a waffle making station (yum!), and they always offer an egg dish (scrambled or omelette), meat (bacon, etc.),cereal, yogurt, granola, fruit, coffee, OJ, and cake, donut or muffins. You can choose to eat either inside or out (or in your room!), and the outside courtyard area is very tranquil and pretty. The pool and surrounding area is large and has a tropical-like feel to it. The hotel has a handy business center as well with free Internet. There's also a manager's cocktail reception 2 or 3 nights a week (I think it was Tues, Wed & Thurs evenings) and the offerings are pretty generous. They had chicken wings, salad, veggies/dip, beer and wine one night when we were there.

The benefits of this hotel for us were its location, which is handy to WDW, many restaurants, a pharmacy, and supermarket (walking distance for all but WDW). Other value-added services included the buffet breakfasts, manager receptions (3 times weekly) guest laundry (nominal fee), complimentary newspapers and shuttles to shops and WDW, tidy pool area and grounds, and willingness of staff to respond to issues brought to their attention. The drawbacks we experienced was a room that desperately needed more regular maintenance prior to guest check-in. For example, we were met with carpets that turned our feet/socks black within moments of walking on them, a toilet that would not flush/drain consistently (2 maintenance calls during our stay alone, problem still occuring on check-out), a moldy/mildewed shower head, curtain (a fresh one provided on request), toilet tank filled with mold, a moldy air exchange system, and rumpled bedding that appeared \"enjoyed\" by the previous guests. We appreciate that cleaning staff in most major hotels have 20 minutes or less to prepare a unit for new guests to arrive, but if you have health issues, such as sensitivities to molds, mildews, or dust mites, this is probably a hotel you want to avoid until the management works out a better maintenance schedule. Think I am being too fussy? Check out what the Centre for Disease Control has to say about exposure to molds and mildews.

The breakfast was extensive...certainly not as good as the fresh cooked Embassy Suites breakfasts, but definitely much larger variety than Hampton Inn, Fairfield Inns, etc. It's a bit of an awkward layout with three separate, yet adjoining rooms, but there is plenty of comfortable seating, the food is constantly being replenished and the staff is constantly cleaning the area. There is an adjoining room off to the side which has 3 computers with online and printing capabilities. The location is outstanding. We've stayed in various parts of the Disney area, but prefer the quieter area of Lake Buena Vista rather than the hustle-and-bustle and crowds on I-Drive, which we just don't feel is as nice as Lake Buena Vista. It is conveniently located to all the Disney attractions (a stone's throw from Downtown Disney), the major highway into Orlando (Sea World, Universal, and the airport) and there is certainly no shortage of restaurants. When we return with our teenagers, we will definitely look here first as there is plenty of room for them to have their own space.", "Date": "December 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, FL", "Title": "\u201cA Great Value\u201d", "Author": "CathyinFL", "ReviewID": "UR11636608", "Content": "We stayed for 1 night, for the Mickey's Merry Christmas Party.

Trip Tip: Since we had planned to do the \"Disney Experience\" for several hours each day and then return midday to have lunch the location was great because there were restaurants off Disney grounds and the ability to do grocery shopping at the Winn Dixie immediately behind the hotel. This saved a lot of money for us, The breakfast buffet in the morning also provided a great selection of hot and cold menu items. Again, another great money-saving feature of the hotel. Although the hotel is not on Disney grounds this really was not a drawback. The hotel is within 2 to 10 miles from each Disney park. However, be careful because if you are looking for complete shuttle service to the Disney parks, this hotel does not have it. We opted to drive to the parks each day and pay the $10 parking fee, which ended up being much more compatible with our schedules of going back and forth to the parks when we wanted to.

Booked this hotel using Priority Club points based on reviews on this site, and I have to say I was not disappointed. Check-in could not have been smoother, we were upgraded to a 2-bed suite as my dad is a Platinum member. The only downside for the whole stay was that there were no lifs, our room was on the first floor, so we had to cart our luggage up and down one flight of stairs. But the room was lovely. One bedroom had a king size bed and walk-in wardrobe, with safe. The other bedroom had 2 queen beds. Both bedrooms had an ensuite bathroom. The living/kitchen area was in the middle between the two bedrooms, and to be a bit picky the room isn't set-up very well to watch the TV but then that's not the worst thing in the world when you're on holiday! Having the kitchen was a bonus, and there was a full-size oven and fridge, and a dishwasher. Our room didn't have tea towels or oven gloves though. The maid service visited the room every day even though there is a sign saying that they only provide a light-touch service and nothing on weekends, unless you speak to the front desk. There is a little shop for basic amenities and the Daily Mail newspaper. There is a business centre with free internet connection and printing facilities and Wifi in the clubhouse. I didn't use the pool but it looked nice, my family who visited enjoyed it, however, it was very busy. Also the pool is open late so if you're down that end of the complex it could be quite noisy. The complimentary breakfast was excellent. Each morning there was a selection of cereals, muffins, cook-your-own waffles, and at least two hot dishes, which varied daily (bacon and scrambled eggs, sausages and cheese omelets).

I worried about some of the reviews I found here, but found they were substantually untrue when we got there. One of the best tips I got here was there are no elevators (lifts) so If you have a problem with stairs request a lower floor. We requested a first floor, quiet, recently renovated room and that is exactly what we got even though the hotel was booked full during the spring break period. Yes the breakfast was fine, nice to be able to eat right there in the sunshine before a day of battle at the parks. Room was clean and very spacious, we had only a single bedroom suite as we only had two adults and one small child, but really ample room to make things comfortable. We really didn't use the kitchen except the sink and the fridge, but everything worked and was well stocked, silverware, glassware, corkscrew, icemaker etc. We checked in early, checked out late, felt safe the whole time, things were quiet, staff friendly and helpfull. Common areas were nice and kept clean, same for the pool and the area around. The pool is not as big as it looks in photos online, but nice just the same as we didn't go when it was busy. I think the people who complain about the grade of cabinetry or how they found a speck of dirt here and there, or the maids hadn't done thier room every day by 1pm should get a grip. If you want first class luxury accomodations go to the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress ($190-$300 a night for 360 sq ft room), Ritz-Carlton Orlando Grande Lakes ($320-$500 a night per room), Disney's Grand Floridian Resort and Spa ($400-$600 a night for 406 sq ft room). Keep in mind the above quotes are rooms, not suites so double these figures for suites or adjoining rooms. Maybe I am easy but it seems to me if you want a decent, clean, well maintained suite type hotel, right near Disney, serves free breakfast, that's inexpensive and you are able to look past the occasional flaw then this place is a good bet. If you want perfection at any price, try one of the above. If you want perfection at Staybridge Suites prices, stay home. BTW. I am not that easy, I am a platinum Priority Club member plenty of travel experience. On this trip we also stayed 4 nights at the Crowne Plaza Universal (Jr Suite Priority Club Level) and 5 nights at Disney's Grand Floridian (Lodge Concierge). Were they nicer you ask..... Yup. Did we pay a lot more for that level accommodation..... Yup, yes indeed we did. Would I go back to Staybridge Suites Lake Buena Vista? Certainly, I go to Orlando for fun, not to look for things to nit pick about.

It's about a mile from Disneys main gates that lead to Downtown Disney. We used the complimentary bus service to the Disney parks most of the time. The breakfasts were excellent, selection of cereals every morning along with juices, then toast, pastries, muffins, bacon, eggs etc in rotation. There were waffle machines available to make your own. The kids loved these. We had a two bedroom suite overlooking the pool. The room was as we requested, non-smoking. 3 televisions, 2 double beds in one room along with it's own bathroom and a whopping king size bed in master bedroom along with it's own bathroom and dressing room (which contained ironing board etc and safe). The sitting room/kitchenette was a good size. Room was clean and well decorated - some of the kitchen cupboards had marks but who cares I wasn't there to cook! The beds were made everyday along with the towels being replaced - the room was hoovered every few days. The only day the room wasn't done was the Sundays we were there which didn't bother us (if you put in a request the room will be done 7 days per week). There was always plenty of hot water for baths/showers and plenty of car parking space. There was a managers special three times a week (Tues through to Thursday 5.30-7.30) where there were such things as chicken wings, cookout with hotdog and burgers, soft drinks, wine beer. You can get coffee 24 hours a day from the machine in the dining room. The kids loved the pool and there are plenty of sunloungers and chairs, this shuts at 11pm, so any noise will be gone by the time you want to sleep. The hot tub is as it says hot, but welcome when your feet are killing you! There were always plenty of papers (local) in the lobby but we never had time to read them anyway. The business centre had 3 computers with internet access. The hotel is in an excellent location for restaurants - Sizzler, Black Angus, Shoneys, Steak 'n' Shake, Olive Garden, Burger King, IHOP to name a few. Winn Dixies and a Papa Johns pizza place is behind the hotel, Walgreens across the road. Also a couple of gift shops across the main road, also a petrol (gas) station.

The air conditoning stayed on a constant 66 F, which we consider far too cold (prefer 72 F). We tried to turn the heat up a bit, but it didn't help. We should have called maintenance, but opted it out since we were leaving the following morning anyways. The bathroom however, especially the needs refurnishing though - low water pressure, cheap wall covering and a faulty shower head. It's an O.K. place, but we experienced far better value later the same month at the Crowne Plaza on Universal Bvld.

The place looks like it has not been cleaned or updated in years they claim renovation in 2005 but no way is that so (This claim has more to do with the staybridge on international drive which by the way some eager trip advisor commentators have mixed up with when writing there positive posts about the staybridge Lake Beuna Vista.) full house keeping is by request otherwise minimal clean up is done. The two bedrooms are a drop better then the one bedroom suites in terms of cleanliness but their only real feature is the fact that you get two bedrooms. The mattress had no support whatsoever (a problem which is hotel wide as we were offered to switch rooms) and the pull out sofa bed had springs sticking out. The bathroom and refrigerator were dirty (old disgusting stains) and the air conditionaing vents were full of dirt. Additionally while not a big deal but for the money you expect much better all the kitchen cabinets were chipped . There are NO ELEVATORS and the hotel is THREE FLIGHTS! The fact that there are no elevators is really not a well known fact. Afterarriving from the airport with your things or coming back to the hotel with a bunch of kids after a long day in the theme parks you are not interested in having to climb a bunch of steps. Currently there is also a discrepancy in the hotel ratings some websites list the hotel as 3 star while some list it a 2 - 2 1/2 star which it truly is dont get fooled! The only positive about this hotel that I can think of is that it is near disney parks and shopping areas. As there is no shortage of hotels suited for a family trip in the orlando area you are much better off spending your money elsewhere for the price the Staybridge charges. P.S. if you are thinking of staying at the staybridge international drive beware that while it is more updated then Lake Beuna vista it is more of a motel then hotel and the bedrooms have a queen bed as opposed to a king.", "Date": "July 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Limerick, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cNeeds a Clean Up\u201d", "Author": "ciog52", "ReviewID": "UR3654763", "Content": "I have just returned from a five-day stay in Staybridge Suites where I stayed with my wife, adult son and my two other boys aged 16 & 11.The first thing is location, which is excellent for visiting Disney. The suite itself had three rooms and two bathrooms. The kitchen was very poorly equipped with old-fashioned equipment but what concerned me most was the condition of one of the bathrooms. Complaints about it produced no results. The shower was dirty with discoloration between the tiles and generally neglected. The other bathroom was very clean. The walls are thin and you will hear the people above moving around. We were on the ground floor. The food at breakfast time is just ok but you can have your breakfast outside which is very pleasant. The two younger boys loved the pool, gym and games room. There is also free Internet access. Staff are helpful but the place needs a revamp and there is no excuse for allowing a bathroom to become that neglected.", "Date": "July 10, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Staybridge Suites Lake Buena Vista", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34515-d112103-Reviews-Staybridge_Suites_Lake_Buena_Vista-Orlando_Florida.html", "Price": "$124 - $202*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">8751 Suiteside Drive</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Orlando</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">32836</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515883", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e5/f8/e5f860846c346f1a92ebf48334450e8711large.jpg"}}
