Breakfasts were especially good and included in our e booking offer. Good coffee shop and deli just across the road should you want any snacks to take out with you for the day. Unfortunately not quite so impressed with the bar service as the waiter could not seem to quite see us, food eventually was good. Amazing week in NY, we had great weather and did all the sites and shopping. It\u2019s worth booking this hotel for the location alone.

Firstly the location can't be beat; there are few hotels of this standard that manage to combine the right mix of closeness to all the major landmarks whilst retaining a feeling of solitude. Admittedly the sofitel is never going to win awards for the views out of the window but New York is for walking in, not watching from the inside :-) Service is great; everyone smiles, says hello (or bonjour/soir) and nothing is too much trouble. Last time I was here I griped a little that no renovation was going on but on inspection I can see that they're constantly renovating rooms, just in the same style and layout and why not if it isn't broken? Entertainment system is great and free wi-fi whilst it says is a \"low-fi\" option vs the paid for version I can testify that my ipad couldn't tell the difference so save your money. L'Occitane in the bathrooms is nice and the usual biscuits and water with turn-down service is a nice touch.

Our first experience of the Sofitel was 2008, we were in New York for the All-Star Game, we were in room 1609, loved it. We met the Doormen Randy & Elvis who were great at recommending eating places and Subway advice to get to the Baseball Stadiums. Our first stay was 5 days, a fantastic Hotel, the dining was fantastic, Gaby's is great. The fresh orchids are to die for, their even in the Bathrooms. Rooms are by far the biggest I've styed in, in NYC. Sadly as we were waiting on the Limo we had an incident with a flower display that landed on us, to this day we still get recongnised in the hotel as the poor Scottish Couple, who were a bit wet! But the Manager at the time Vincent Vienne was fantastic, getting us a room to clean up, and urging us to email him when we got home. I did and Vincent kindly upgraded us to a suite on our next visit the following year. Sadly Vincent is now in Philidelphia Sofitel. So in 2009 we went for a further 5 days, the Hotel was just as good as the first visit, back again in 2010, then last July 2011, for 7 days, we were greeted with hugs and handshakes from Randy and Elvis, we were welcomed to the hotel by Paula the Concierge, who was a really nice, talkative and helpful person. I love the Eggs Benidect for Breakfast in Gaby's, the evening meals are always wonderful, Gregory Polino is a great restaurant Manager and Sylvian Harribey a great Executive Chef with a fantastic Menu. The rooms are great and the SObed is to die for. Their cocktail menu is also very extensive, with their lychee martini and mojito a must to try. We have never had a disappointing stay at this Hotel and look forward to our next stay in 2013. Since staying in this Sofitel we have booked into the ones in London, France and Brussels, the whole chain is wonderful, the design of the Hotel is exquisite. I just love the Sofitel!!

One thing - the beds are AMAZING ! After a through flight from Sydney, we were so glad we chose the Sofitel as our first sleep was phenomenal! free use of computer in lobby for the internet and complimentary bottled water was also a bonus Did not have the in house breakfast as we ventured out quite a bit and having so many options nearby assisted!

Unfortunately we didn't get off to a great start, it seemed my reservation (booked and paid for 3 weeks prior) was not in the system.

I wasn't too keen on a 3rd level room (mainly concerned about noise rather than view) so reception suggested I leave my bags and come back after 3pm. No worries, as check in is 3pm so not a drama. Happily left my luggage and went off to lunch. Around 4pm I returned and finalized my check in for alas, that's right, a level 3 room.

I quickly rushed back to Front Desk as I thought it was unacceptable, in all fairness, prior giving us the key, the Front Office did phone and checked if the suite was ready. As there was no other Suite available, we accepted the one while it was now being prepared by 3 maids. This turned out to be the only mishap throughout our stay.

The bathroom was medium-sized and only had one sink which was a bit of a problem getting ready to go out for two people. The suite couches were large and comfortable.

There was plenty of seating in the lobby and several PCs to check e-mail and print out boarding passes, etc... Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was great tasting. Coffee from the coffee press was warm and delicious. Prices were fair. Location is good for New York but not quite central. We took in a show on Broadway and walked to it in 10 minutes.

We will never know if we should have taken the risk to take a taxi or if we were right to book an expensive limo (130 USD).

For some reason, I seem to think of the Sofitel brand as a luxury hotel. Maybe it's because they're usually priced so high that I'm fooled into believing that. In any case, the Sofitel NY, while a nice hotel is definitely not a luxury hotel like the Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton chains. It's more comparable to a Renaissance or nice Hyatt Regency. The location of this property is right near Times Square but far enough away so that you're not drowning in crowds while getting to the hotel. Staff is pleasant and welcoming and they definitely do a good job. Rooms are slightly bigger than the \"NYC standard\" but even elite members of the Accor brand don't seem to get upgrades to bigger rooms (how many millions of dollars do you have to spend a year to get that???). The best things are the beds (very comfortable and hard to leave) and bathrooms (nice showers, tubs and amenities). You do get a decent turndown service and they have nice robes and slippers (if that's important to you). There is a small fitness room in the basement with about 3 treadmills and 3 other cardio machines plus some weight machines (2?). It can get crowded in here but at least they have a gym..... I was disappointed to see (maybe I'm missing something) only 1 restaurant/bar here off the check-in desk. It was small and had more of a cafe feel to it than a restaurant (see the Chicago Sofitel for an example of a nice restaurant). It was also grossly overpriced----usually I like to go to the Sofitel's for breakfast as you can usually get a continental basket (fresh baked goods) for around $17-20. Here it was over $25 and didn't include coffee. Hmmmmm........given the number and quality of French restaurants in town, you can do much better outside the Sofitel.

I was very excited about my stay at this hotel since it had good reviews and having stayed at The Royalton (which I loved) across the street during my last NYC trip - I knew it would be the same level of quality and a great location. Prior to arriving, I had been in touch with the front desk to confirm various requests: two double beds, a mini fridge and early check-in. I was told that none of those requests should be a problem but that I should call the hotel the day of to confirm an early check-in. Regarding the early check-in, I even called the night before to find out about the possibility of checking in early and was told that the hotel was not at capacity and it shouldn't be a problem. The morning of my trip, I called from the airport around 8 am and was told that I would definitely be able to check in early - my request was for an 11:30 am - Noon check-in. My flight ended up being delayed because of severe fog and when my friend and I finally arrived around 1:30 pm, exhausted from an overnight flight and travel delays, we were told in a very matter-of-fact and cold manner that our room wouldn't be available until 3 pm, the normal check-in time. I explained that I had called earlier that morning and was guaranteed an early check-in and was told once again in a cold manner that our room would not be available until 3 pm. No apologies for being told otherwise, no sympathy, nothing. Just such a disappointment when you're told one thing only to find out that it won't be honored after a long day of travel. I should mention that I booked this room through Priceline and worried that I was being treated differently because of that. If that was the case, then the Sofitel should not offer their rooms on Priceline if they plan on treating those customers poorly. Even though I got a discount, I still paid quite a bit of money for the stay. Now, the WORST part of the stay happened the next morning. After sleeping in the bed, under the comforter - there's no flat sheet underneath the comforter which I think is kind of gross - I FLIPPPED BACK THE COMFORTER AND THERE WAS A MASSIVE BLOOD STAIN UNDERNEATH THE COMFORTER. I totally screamed and was so grossed out by this. I mean, I had this comforter with a blood stain on top of me while I slept. This wasn't a tiny blood stain, it was bigger than the size of a baseball and I can't believe it wasn't noticed by housekeeping. I called the front desk immediately and they simply said, we'll call housekeeping. No apologies were offered, there was no follow up after, just nothing. I was expecting them to be a bit more mortified. And I would certainly expect them to try to make the situation better by saying, what can I do to make this up to you? Can I offer you a complimentary drink at the bar or let me discount the night you slept under comforter or something along those lines. At the very least, a manager should've been alerted and called me to find out what happened. I really felt like the customer service aspect of the hotel should have kicked in after a disgusting error like that was made. I will say that housekeeping showed up right away and apologized but I was expecting more from the front desk / management because sleeping underneath a GIANT BLOOD STAIN is beyond unacceptable at a hotel like this, or any hotel for that matter. It just really ruined my stay. The other disappointment happened on my last night when I wanted to quickly shave my legs in the bathtub before going out to dinner. The tub plug was jammed / broken and I couldn't get the button / lever to work so the tub would drain water. I ultimately had to dig my nails under the plug and pull it up and the whole thing came out along with a giant hair ball. Gross. On top of that, the spray hose wouldn't work either. At that point, I was in a hurry and didn't bother to call the front desk and just used the shower. How was this broken tub not noticed when it was last cleaned? In terms of the positive aspects of my stay, whenever I spoke to the front desk on the phone, whoever I spoke to each time was very nice. Other than the person who turned me away when I tried to do an early check-in and the the person who offered no apologies when I called about the blood stain on my comforter, all of the other front desk people were pleasant to deal with. The man who actually checked me did call as soon as I got up to my room to make sure I got my mini-fridge which I really appreciated. I wish the level of service had been that attentive and concerned throughout my stay. The room itself was a good size - not huge but big enough and the bathroom was quite nice and spacious. Also, you can't beat the location in NYC in terms of convenience. Had it not been for the fact that I spent the first night sleeping underneath a blood stain and had been coldly denied the early check-in I had been promised, I would have been really happy with my stay. But these two issues, especially the blood-stained comforter just made it difficult for to enjoy my time at the Sofitel. For a hotel that charges the rates that they do, I would expect a luxury experience that would never allow those two issues to happen. I don't think I would ever pay the full rate to stay here after my experience.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico City", "Title": "\u201cQuiet and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "Wanderkinder", "ReviewID": "UR120701254", "Content": "Surprisingly quiet, considering it is located b/w 5th & 6th on 44th, heart of midtown.

My room was OK, with a very comfortable bed, not impressive furniture, a good shower with excelent pressure and all nicely appointed. Unfortunately, soundproofing is not the top quality of the rooms, and in the morning I could hear a very disgusting noise from my neighbor, who seemed to be sick just when waking up. I stayed there four nights. Rooms was cleaned to perfect standards. Breakfast was not buffet and the tables were small, so not easy to set up a breakfast for 4 or 5 people. Still, products of top quality, delicious croissants, all very French. Hoewever, the service was not relaxing at all, making the start of a business day already a business day.

Check-in was quick (they actually had a room available for us at 11:00 a.m.!) and pleasant. The hotel lobby itself was lovely, with stunning floral designs. Our suite was wonderful and had all the amenities we could ask for. Rooms aren't huge, but that is the norm for NY. Staying for four nights, it was a pleasure to have the second room to relax in. Nightly turndown (which we did not use) also included two bottles of water (which we gladly accepted.) On our first night there, we returned from dinner to find a lovely dessert with Happy Anniversary spelled out in chocolate - such a nice treat! The location was outstanding, and we found that we were able to walk to many of the places we wanted to see. When we couldn't, the hotel doormen quickly found us taxis and cars. There were plenty of restaurants nearby; 5th Avenue shopping, Times Square, the Empire State Building, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Central Park and Rockefeller Plaza were all within reasonable walking distance. When it was time to leave, the doorman found us a very pleasant SUV driver for only a few dollars more than a cab to return to the airport. We had a great ride there, but discovered to our horror as we were checking in at the airport that my husband had forgotten his briefcase with our two computers in the car. In a panic, I called the hotel concierge and he quickly connected me with the doorman. The doorman clarified which driver we had used, took my number, and called me back very shortly. He had reached the driver and the driver said he would turn around and come back to the airport for us. Within 15 minutes, he was back, saving our trip from disaster, and refusing to take a tip for his trouble! This was a wonderful choice for a hotel for us.

Firstly 5*s were all above budget in this location. Except a couple which had terrible reviews including some with bed bugs! The Andaz down on wall street was within budget and looked nice but as a tourist do you really want to be on wall street? In an ideal world wouldn't we all stay at the Plaza/ the Mandarin Oriental or the four seasons?? The prices for these were way over budget though. Having therefore ruled out the 5*s this left the 4*s of which there are lots. Reviewing all the 4*s between 50th and 59th street although most were within budget the hotels by and large looked really quite shabby with small rooms and again sometimes bed bugs. I couldnt bring myself to want to stay in any of them. I therefore widened my search to include 40th to 59th street. At last some hotels which looked lovely, had good reviews and were affordable. The Sofitel for me was top of the pile. I loved the decor of this hotel and certainly would not describe the rooms as bland. Lots of beautiful woods in the rooms, marble bathrooms with back lit mirrors, separate shower and bath, wonderful soft beds with lovely cotton sheets, complimentary L'Occitane toiletaries, Great views, large flat screen tv with loads of channels (not that you will have time to use it in NY), Bose sound system with mp3 connector, mirrored wall next to the bed :) . The hotel was very clean and the staff pleasant and helpful. The hotel has a great location on 44th street between 5th and 6th avenues. I.e close to everything but in a quiet side street. 10-15 mins walk to central park. 5 mins walk to time square/ Broadway. 1 min walk to 5th avenue and all the best shops. The public areas of the hotel are lovely too. Cant really fault it. The price was around $410/night as the hotel website was doing 4 nights for the price of 3 in Oct 2011. I cant comment on the food as we ate out every night. With so many great restaurants in NY why would you eat at the hotel?

It is a great hotel with an excellent staff, a very good restaurant, good room service, proximity to touristy things, and to businessy things, and to many of the nicer neighbourhoods of New York (if you're up for a little walking). Yes, it's close to Times Square and people sometimes get a little huffy about the tourists, but get over it! This hotel is also close to many very good restaurants and is within walking distance to Central Park, the Rockefeller Center, the Apple Store, Broadway, you name it! Some of my favourite features of the Sofitel: 1) The staff: The people who work here are great and they take their jobs very seriously. I actually only go to this hotel every couple of months or less, but the staff remember me - and it's not just because my name shows up on their computer. I once had one of the staff chase me out of the hotel after I left my wallet at the check-in desk and we've been joking about it ever since. They will also usually try to upgrade you if they can. It helps if you're a member of the Sofitel 'A Club' for which it is easy to sign up. No matter what I ask for, they always do everything they can to help. The doorman even remembers guests. I have, many times, exited a cab from JFK to have the Sofitel doorman tell me \"Welcome back, sir\", even when I haven't been back in awhile. 2) The food, both in the hotel restaurant as well as the room service, not to mention the great restaurants in the proximity. If you want decent, cheap food, there is a good deli across 45th Street, and there's a Chipolte nearby as well. 3) All of the interesting things to see and learn about in the immediate area, eg, Grand Central Station, the various university clubs and other clubs (they're not *that* exclusive and most will give you a free tour if you ask), and a myriad of other historical things to see and do in the area. It's worth buying a guidebook. 4) The ability to get literally anything you want at any time of the day or night in this part of New York (not unique to the Sofitel but nevertheless. . .). 5) The rooms and the views: If you're into architecture, the views obviously vary but you can get excellent views of the Chrysler Building, the Rockefeller Center, Grand Central / MetLife Building, and some of the classic 'guilded age' and art-deco buildings of New York. Also, if you want to pay for a more expensive room or get upgraded, the suites are quite sizable and some have very good urban views. One recommendation with this hotel: Due to the nature of the location, a one-way cross street, if you need to get somewhere, book a car; try to avoid taking a taxi. It can be difficult to get a taxi from the hotel, even with the help of the doorman. They will do everything they can to help you but it can take up to 15 minutes sometimes and that can make a big difference if you're trying to get to the airport. Otherwise, I've no complaints. This is excellent value for money. I have stayed here and at the Iroquois next door which is cheaper for a reason. Spend the extra $100 and stay here.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNice but Expensive\u201d", "Author": "cat0407", "ReviewID": "UR118757195", "Content": "Loved the room, loved the location...Very expensive but New York is...The restaurant is ridiculousy priced and I was extremely upset to see that frois gras was on the menu...This is pure torture of geese...About time restaurants started to think about what they serve and what is humane...

Small touches that I've never seen in any of the other 4-stars near Broadway. The rooms are clean and spacious (for NYC), and if you want midtown, the location is ideal.

Very ordinary breakfast. Across the road from the hotel, there's Gregory cafe that serves good coffee and delicious pastries, sandwiches and fresh yoghurt options. Even though we were happy with the hotel's location and facilities, we will not stay here again. For the price we paid, we should have had a more luxurious facilities.

We stayed on a room only basis and I am pleased we did as the breakfasts were very expensive, There is a coffee shop opposite the hotel that is a much cheaper option, plus a diner next door. The room was reasonably spacious and very quiet for its location. The bed was comfortable and clean, and the bathroom good with a powerful shower. The room was well cleaned and the whole hotel was well presented with lots of fresh flowers. There is a small room off the lobby where you can use the computers and internet. We used room service once and while prompt I did not think the food was great in terms of quality, although it was not worse than that found in comparable hotels. There is a lovely Greek restaurant almost next door to the hotel which we would highly recommend. The staff that we had contact with were all very helpful and polite with most speaking French and English.

So much to do, so little time. We were supposed to have a week in New York but unfortunately we were hit with some incredibly poor luck... we arrived on August 22, August 23rd we were standing in line for our Letterman tickets and found out the East Coast just experienced an earthquake which was apparently felt in New York City (we never felt a thing). Upon returning to the Sofitel (after the Letterman Show) we found out that Hurricane Irene was bearing down on the East Coast and a significant threat to the North East Coast and New York City! I re-booked our flights to leave a day before the storm was to arrive. So we had to leave 2.5 days earlier than intended. I prepaid for this entire trip via Expedia, I hope between the Sofitel and Expedia they will reimburse me for the 2 nights we were unable to stay. Our entire stay at the Sofitel was nothing but positive! Our reservation was for a queen room on an upper floor (18th floor +), when we checked in we were pleasantly surprised to hear that we had been upgraded from a queen to a king room but since we had checked in late there wasn't a king available on an upper floor. We were checked into a room on the 12th floor and advised we would be moved to a higher floor the following day. When we arrived to our room there was classical music playing, we also had received the daily turn down service. There was also a couple tasty French pastries and high end bottled water. The room was very clean and quiet. The beds and pillows were comfortable. The TV was HD and the clock/radio was Bose. The soap, shampoo and conditioner were of high quality. Complimentary robe and slippers. My only complaint is I would have liked more light in the bathroom. The following day we packed our bags and the bellman moved them to our new king room on a higher floor (23rd floor) while we were out enjoying New York. The entire staff at the Sofitel were very friendly, greeting us with smiles and \"Bonjour\", \"Bonsoir\" each time we went through the lobby. The location was perfect, close enough to Times Square but far away enough to be out of the chaos. Truly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend the Sofitel if it is in your price range. If you are in New York for vacation, check out the New York Pass... depending on what you are interested in, you could potentially save you a significant amount of money. I would also suggest the hop-on/hop off bus tours, however, I would not use City Sights NY but rather the Gray Line. With the New York Pass you get a free 3 hour cruise around Manhattan, you get the best views of the Statue of Liberty. Times Square, obviously a definite must-see... the pulse of Manhattan. Empire State Building... get there early, we got there when it first opened and did not have to wait in any long lines and it was not very busy at up at the observatory. Brooklyn Bridge... walk across it, only takes 25 minutes and you get some fantastic views and photo opportunities. Central Park... grab a sandwich at one of the nearby delis, go into the park to enjoy this magnificent park. There is so much else to see but that should get you started.

For me the \"so-comfy\" beds far out-shines other hotel offerings and coupled with a decent sized marbled bathroom this hotel has a winning formula. All the rooms and suites I have stayed have been of a decent size as have the bathrooms. We like Gaby's for a relaxed drink and the olives are always delicious.

I asked if it was too early to check in but they said if my room was available, it wouldn't be a problem.

The queen bed had a comfy mattress and pillows with crisp sheets and a down duvet. The view was lovely and the bathroom was spacious, simple but luxurious. The fresh orchids added a nice touch =) Room service was always available, and the staff in the halls always asked how my stay was and if I needed anything.

Only complaint is that internet was not included in the room rate and you have to pay US$5-$10 per day. Given the room rate we paid (> US$400 per night), internet should have been included.

Plain hotel. Does the job with friendly smiles\u201d", "Author": "Asta72", "ReviewID": "UR116084485", "Content": "Rating: A strong 3. While there is absolutely nothing wrong with the very friendly and attentive service the hotel provides and the location of the very same, i do have a problem with slow internet and uncomfortable beds. The bed is rather hard and the pillows just disintegrate once you lay your head upon them. The A/C is also disturbing at night time as it blows directly on you in bed + makes a clicking sound every few seconds. There were also some glitches in the service that affected the rating in a negative fashion. Location: A 5 minute walk (in leisurely tempo) from Times square AND 5th Avenue. So not far away from great shopping or the theatres + an easy distance from Central Park so extremely well situated IMO. Room: We had 2 connecting rooms, 1 suite (1822) and one king bedroom(1823). I really liked their system of closing a door in the main corridor, creating a large hallway, so that one can go back and forth in between the 2 rooms without having to use the keys. Also, if this is the solution you would like to go for, please do note that the highest floor you can have is the 18th. But the views are more than ok anyways! The d\u00c3\u00a9cor is nothign special. Feels new enough, but is very discreet. Also these rooms are at the end of the hotel so i do imagine that they are maybe a bit quieter than other rooms. Pro\u00c2\u00b4s: * It is not noisy at all from the street or from other rooms * The rooms are large by NYC city hotel room standards!! * Big bathtub (1822) and large freestanding shower (1822). Regular sized tub and freestanding shower in 1823 * Great water pressure and heat * H\u00c3\u00a8rmes amenities which are divine * Good views * Really good storage space for both clothes and toiletries * The room becomes very dark * It is very clean! Con\u00c2\u00b4s: * The bed and pillows are not comfortable and the bedlinen merely just more than ok. * The A/C is placed in a silly place so it blows directly at you when you lay in bed and makes clicking sounds every few seconds . * Rather odd labyrinthesque layout * Internet is beyond slow at times, very un-even speeds Staff/Service: Very pleasant and providing good service in every department in general. Their concierges (Vladimir in particular!) is utmost helpful and great with helping out with everything from renting a specific car, suggesting ticket reservations to finding rare garments. Food: Breakfast was good, but on the expensive side. Service a tad slow and in-accurate ie brought things not ordered. Only had dinner at Gaby once, it was good. Service was nicely executed. Internet: It is only charged per room, not by device which is good....It is easy to connect to, but annoyingly slow at times...! Laundry/Drycleaning: Only gave garments once. They were returned late + they also tried to deliver garments that were not ours at first! Plus my pants were probably never even laundered...! I gave them due to 2 icecream stains and they came back with the very same stains. Just pressed into the fabric so i both saw and felt them!!! They probably didn\u00c2\u00b4t see them as the pants were dark, but that\u00c2\u00b4s un-acceptable! The hotel did however remove the crage. Amenities/minibar: The minibar is sufficently stocked. But the amenities are to die for! H\u00c3\u00a8rmes all the way through making bathtime most pleasureble. Although is hould mentin that the amenities are way less chich in the regular room... \"Just L\u00c2\u00b4Occitane\". Kind of odd to make such a distinction in between the rooms. But they do provide macaroons with their turndown service which makes almost anything forgiven, hooray! Things to do/To think about: * Bring your comfortable walkingshoes * Plan your activities by local areas * Shop! * If you can, spend more time than planned in the city as it really has something to ofeer everyone at any given time.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGreat midtown location\u201d", "Author": "BobV_52", "ReviewID": "UR116080562", "Content": "An upscale hotel in a great location, walking distance to Times Square, ESB, 30 Rock, Bryant Park, Central Park.

Finding the location convenient for everything we love to do, we've never considered staying anywhere else. However, I think that, at last, it might be time for a change because after this stay, I feel the world has moved on and left the Sofitel behind. For sure, the same easy elegance is still here. The location couldn't be better for us and we love having The Red Flame a few doors away (!) but the Sofitel isn't cheap and, for the price paid, I think we might expect better. To start, I think the Sofitel NYC is the only hotel we use in the US which has no coffee making facility in the rooms. When we wake early and jetlagged, the coffee shop across the road or the Starbucks around the corner are of little use when a hot drink there and then, before starting the day is just what we need. In addition, there are extra charges for internet connection. Five or six years ago, perhaps this was no surprise, but these days even the low-cost inns offer free wifi and this extra charge merely adds to the overall cost of the stay. Why not build it into the price? These niggles don't take away the fact that the beds are super-comfortable, cool bedlinen ensures a great night's sleep and the bedroom and bathroom are immaculately clean and well maintained. But the rooms are a little dull and the furnishings rather beige. Not a thing has changed in these rooms since our first visit and what worked well in a few years ago is now rather bland. But sorry Sofitel, I think it's time to move on. There's plenty of choice out there; bright, breezy, modern places right here on the doorstep, offering all those little extras that I've missed on this visit and which would have made my stay so much more comfortable.

I felt important from the second that I set foot in the door, and the high quality of service extended to room service and housekeeping as well. (3) Location, location, location. Okay, so many people try to steer clear of Times Square, but, if you're going to NYC on business in particular, you're going to want to stay right in the middle of it all. (The restaurant selection on 44th Street is pretty incredible, too.) (4) I definitely recommend this hotel, but I should explain my 4/5 review. The -1 is due, yes, to little things: the dreaded \"green stuff\" on metal fixtures/features in the bathroom; small stains--that, I could see, had not come out in the wash--on the comforter; unusual (not bad, just unusual) smell to the room.

Sadly, it never came (I was more disappointed for my wife, not being too fussed myself). Had we never been told about it, I would've given a higher \"service\" score. I received a feedback-request email upon returning home, and briefly mentioned the gift. The general manager replied offering a free room upgrade on our next stay, which was appreciated. For breakfast most mornings we went out the back exit of the hotel, crossed the road and walked a few metres to the right where there was an excellent deli: fresh food, great coffee, great granola yoghurts. It was probably 5-times cheaper than the hotel breakfast menu, with perhaps double the serving size. Highly recommended. Popular place. There are three computers in the lobby with free internet \u00e2\u20ac\u201d good for searching the sights. Location: excellent. Just a 5-10 minute walk to Times Square, yet in a much quieter spot. The staff all seemed very friendly. Ask the concierge team if you're looking for a good local restaurant. I'd certainly stay here if I return to New York.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cReally enjoyed our stay.\u201d", "Author": "stesuec", "ReviewID": "UR115022989", "Content": "My wife and I have just returned from a fantastic 7 night stay at the Sofitel.

We were given a room right by the elevator bank on the 10th floor of the hotel, but we didn't experience any noise issues. The vibe in the hotel is definitely luxury, though not quite like the Pierre or Peninsula hotels. All the hotel attendants and front desk reps we interacted with were helpful, perhaps even eager to help. While I have no specific anecdotes to relay, in my mind and experience, that can be a positive! There are certainly no aspects to our stay that were sub-optimal - I would stay at the Sofitel again, particularly if our plans included more Broadway shows and gallivanting around the city. (The Sofitel is located right off Fifth Avenue, equidistant to the B/D/F/V and 4/5/6, making it easy to traipse around Manhattan.) If you know, however, that your plans don't require you to be near Times Square or Lincoln Center (or the general Midtown area), the Sofitel isn't necessarily the best option.

That's the question my husband and I kept asking ourselves. We've been to New York many times but we always stay in different hotels because we have not been happy with previous ones (The Hudson and the Paramount are two that scored badly in my books. The W was mediocre and I would not rush to return.) Are we super picky? I look for good service, cleanliness, a well designed room, adequate lighting -- and a room that doesn't feel like a closet. That should not be out of reach for \"quality hotels\". Our favorite hotel in any city is the Sofitel in Montreal, surely there must be something comparable in NYC?!! So when a spring sale came up at the Sofitel New York, we arranged our trip to take advantage of the good rates. When we first arrived the room we were given wasn't \"great\". By comparison the Sofitel in Montreal feels airy and spacious and has huge modern glass windows looking out onto the city. The NY room we were given was spacious (by NYC standards) but it only had a single window with a view of brick walls and rusting water tanks on rooftops. I called the front desk and asked if there were any rooms they could give us in the same price bracket that had a good view. We waited about 20 minutes, and one of the hotel managers called and said she would show us two possible rooms on higher floors. The room we agreed on was similar in layout to the one on the lower floor, but this one had a great view of New York and the Chrysler Building. As I am a photographer having a view is a big plus, so I was pleased with the room change. We stayed at the Sofitel New York for 4 nights. There were a few minor things I asked to be fixed (a broken hairdryer, not enough hangers in the closet, not enough towels, a bedsheet with a mark on it). All requests were taken care of promptly. My summary: The Sofitel New York delivered on all counts: service, comfort, cleanliness, a well designed room, good lighting, good internet, and in a central location that made walking our preferred mode of transportation. Most days we ate at restaurants nearby where the price of breakfast is cheaper than a latte at Starbucks, but on the last day we treated ourselves to breakfast at the hotel restaurant. It was expensive. My husband said, \"This hotel is a reminder why we need to earn more money!\" I agreed. Sofitel New York is now my favorite hotel in NYC.

I have also stayed at other hotels in New York but now I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see myself switching. Well, maybe if I got a penthouse at the Palace for a good rate. I arrived in NYC (LGA) around 3:30 in the afternoon and then had the longest taxi ride at just over one hour to get to Sofitel. When you arrive at Sofitel you are usually greeted by a Bellman, on this trip I had a couple people ahead of me at the curb and one group had about 13 pieces of luggage. With my two small bags I just headed for the front desk quickly bypassing the people with all the luggage. Front Desk: I have always had good experiences with the Front Desk staff at Sofitel, always professional and helpful. On this trip I ran into the General Manager of the hotel, Mr. Jorge Tito. I had met Mr. Tito last year while checking out of the hotel and had a conversation with him about my stay and some upcoming trips. He then assisted with my check in and I was quickly off to my room. The Room: I was in 1622, a junior suite, this trip. The room faces 44th Street with decent views. I have read some reviews saying the furniture and room is outdated and if that is true it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not by much. They are scheduled for renovation this year and I am looking forward to seeing the new look. The junior suite living area has a writing desk and chair. Couch with a comfortable chair next to it and an entertainment center. There is one of those mini bar refrigerators with the weight sensitive items inside so be careful you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look inside and move anything unless you intent to buy. The bedroom is very big compared to other NYC hotels. The bed is EXTREMELY comfortable. There is plenty of closet space and an area for hanging your clothes in the hallway between the bedroom and bathroom. The bathroom is also huge compared to other NYC hotels. Each bathroom has a separate stand alone shower and bathtub. The water pressure has always been strong and hot. I kept my windows opened during most of my stay only because I like fresh air and enjoy the sounds of the City. During this trip I did get a wakeup call that I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting however. The Puerto Rican Day Parade was on Saturday and they were lining up floats and other entries outside of the hotel on 44th Street. The parade made it hard to get around for a couple hours but by early evening everybody was gone and the City had the streets all cleaned up again. Pros & Cons Pro: Small hotel, about 400 rooms. Quiet hotel. I saw the GM, Mr. Tito assisting guests a couple times during my stay. Once he was helping guests with their bags off the elevator and another assisting at the front doors with guests. You will most likely not find that at your bigger hotels. The hotel is just about 2 blocks off of Times Square and maybe half a mile walk to Benjamin Steakhouse on 41st Street. Housekeeping has always been good and one thing that I have noticed is that I rarely see the carts in the hallways. There are also two Duane Reade Stores (Pharmacy / Grocery) one block away in each direction so if you forgot something you are only steps away. Con: The bed does not have a second sheet. I have read reviews where this really bothers people. For me the only real problem is that the comforter can get too hot so there is no real happy medium. All in all I would and have certainly recommended Sofitel New York to my friends. I will be back in July with friends from Texas and Ohio for a celebration dinner at Benjamin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Steakhouse and to see the fireworks too.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLocation,Location,Location !\u201d", "Author": "djhallett", "ReviewID": "UR112994498", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 11 nights in mid May and had a great time.

Located within a 10 minute walk to Times Square, Grand Central, Rockefeller Center, and Herald Square, and most of the major subway lines. Its really right in the middle of Manhattan. Doorman at hand, the concierge/bag check right when you enter, followed by small lobby area with comfy leather seating, a small room on the side (entrance visible when you leave, not when you enter) with three computer terminals offering free internet access, and at the end, the main counter to the left. Decor is classy and simple, leathers and warm woods. Service was ubiquitous, friendly, and attentive; some spoke French and/or with a French accent, which was a pleasant touch if not really necessary. Check-in was efficient. Turn-down service in the evening was sweet, with ambient lighting and classical music playing as you enter. I stayed in a 6th floor king bed room, which was large, of similar decor theme as the rest of the hotel, with good quality furniture, fixtures, and linens. The set-up around the bed was beautifully designed, including the lighting, artwork above the bed, and side tables. Bed was firm and very comfortable. The bathroom has a double door entry without locks. There is a separate glass-enclosed shower stall in addition to a tub.

The Sofitel hotels are apparently known for their comfortable beds and this was no exception. The thick comforter was warm and soft - sleep came easily the first night. I should mention that we did not eat in the hotel since there were so many restaurants and coffee shops in the immediate area. Across the street, good coffee can be had at Gregory's Coffee, and good food at a reasonable price can be eaten at the Red Flame a few doors down from the Sofitel. One the word: the area where the Sofitel is located is extremely well situated for almost all of the theaters in midtown; the subway lines are closeby, and it's a short walk to a lot of the major sites (Empire State Bldg, Grand Central Terminal, Chrysler Bldg, Times Square, etc.) It's really crowded and noisy on the streets, but once you were inside the hotel and your room, it was extremely quiet.

I asked the concierge to call the airport from time to time to check about my luggage - but he just told me that it will arrive, so I don't need to worry.

The location is excellent, and with in walking distances of alot on the main attractions. This part of 44th street is nice and quiet, and perfect for what we wanted. 2 blocked over towards 7th Avenue you will find Times Square (very busy) I am so glad I didnt choose a hotel there right in the middle of all the hustle and bustle. When we first got to the hotel and walked into the lobby / reception area, you could tell straight away that this was going to be a great place to stay (and we were not wrong). It had that classy / luxury feel about it. Check in /check out - perfect, no problems and no waiting around. ROOMS - Rooms were very spacious, clean and comfortable. Bathroom have a bath and large shower. It was a very classy bathroom. Now the bed was AWESOME. Very big and probably the most comfortable that we have stayed in. Even to the point that just before we checked out, my wife decided to take the covers off the pillows and bed to check the labels to see what they were. (sad? Probably!!) We thought we might see if we could find them online, which we did and which we realised they were very expensive, so we wont be purchasing them!! oh well!! The one day it was raining when we went outside. The doorman had a large umbrella which he gave us to use for the day. Little things like that go along way. So overall this hotel is brilliant. It was so nice, especially after and packed and tiring day of sightseeing to come back to such a wonderful hotel to have a chill out before going out for the evening and then getting back to recharge the batteries for the following day.

They were cheaper polyester of some sort and too high so I slept most of the night without the pillows and woke up with a neck pain. My hubby woke up with a bad backache.

The staff is very professional and there to help you without being intrusive. ARRIVAL: You are greeted by a Bellman and taken into the hotel where you can either leave the bag(s) with him or take them yourself to the front desk. My suggestion would be to take a look at how busy they are inside of the lobby before leaving your bags. If they are swamped you might want to take them with you to the front desk. Even if your room is not ready and you want to check your bags the front desk will take care of that for you. On the other hand, if the room is ready you can head right up stairs with your bags. FRONT DESK: The staff at the front desk has always been very professional and helpful. On one visit when my room was not ready the staff member invited me to have a drink on the house at Gaby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. She then, instead of just pointing me in the direction of, she walked me into the restaurant and then returned shortly to inform me that the room was ready. THE ROOM: I have always stayed in their Junior Suite so I can only speak about that type of room. These rooms are approximately 650 Sq ft with a living room, bedroom and a large bathroom. The rooms are very quiet, unless you open a window to hear some of the noises Manhattan has to offer. I mainly leave a window open myself because I do enjoy hearing the sounds of the City and the flow of fresh air. The living room has a couch and chair along with a work desk with a chair. There are plenty of lights throughout the room if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re into well lit rooms. The bed is extremely comfortable with plenty of pillows to choose from. I have seen some people comment at the fact that the beds do not offer a bed sheet, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a comforter. I will agree with this concern only because the comforter is very warm and sometimes you could just use a sheet. This issue would not keep me from returning however. There are small reading lights on the headboard if you want to do a little reading before sleeping. Also, when you close the drapes your room is practically blacked out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a nice touch for a good night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep. THE BATHROOM: I cannot speak about the bathroom amenities only because I travel with my own but there are plenty provided on the sink and in the shower. One of the selling points of SOFITEL for me is the fact that they provide a separate tub and stand alone shower. The tub even has a shower wand. I believe this is the case with all types of rooms within SOFITEL. HOUSEKEEPING: Well, here is where SOFITEL excels for sure. I do not have one bad thing to say about this staff. When you return at the end of the day of doing whatever it is you do out in the City the room looks just like it did when you first entered. When you talk with the staff in the hallways they are always very polite and professional. They do not just say hello while running by you. I do not want to ramble on too long about this but I have always commented to the hotel management after my stays and Housekeeping always gets the highest marks. I would suggest to anyone staying there to leave a nice tip on the pillow for these hard working people. PUBLIC AREAS: The hotel lobby and other areas have always been very clean and smell nice. I have noticed while sitting in the lobby that as staff members walk through, from Bellmen to even managers, will go adjust pillows on the couches or clean off a table if needed. The gym, located in the basement is also clean and ready with plenty of towels. CHECKOUT: When checking out the staff member will always ask you how your stay was and if they could have done anything to make it better. One thing I have noticed is when they ask you they are actually paying attention to you \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not like they are just reading off of a card. I also had the pleasure of meeting the General Manager of SOFITEL during my most recent checkout. He too asked how my stay was and I believe that he was genuine when he said he wanted to know if they could have done anything to make my stay better. From the GM, to the Bellman, to the Housekeeping staff and everyone else wearing a SOFITEL uniform, the staff is outstanding. I have seen some people comment that SOFITEL is expensive but worth it and although they are I will also add that if you look you can find dates where their prices are very reasonable and within the range or better than other midtown hotels. I cannot suggest you stay at this hotel enough.

The room was very nice; I can't comment on how the room sizes compared to other hotels across the city, but there was a good sized bedroom and lounge, nice marble bathroom with rainforest type shower and soaking bath, and a small connecting area where there were a couple of wardrobes. The hotel had left a celebration cake for us, which was a nice touch. We never managed to eat a meal there as we were out every night, and we for breakfast we used the Red Flame diner just down the road (which was good value, but be prepared to order immediately and eat even quicker). We drank a couple of cocktails at the bar, and they were nice and not unreasonably priced. The whole hotel has a quite opulent feel, with lots of marble and flowers everywhere. Service was excellent, and the only small negative I would make is that there was only one bath robe in the room, which despite being raised with the concierge, was never rectified.

We got a deal for $700 for three nights in a luxury king room with extras like early check-in, late check-out, room upgrade, free gift and breakfast each morning. We got in early and they said they could not accomodate us for early check in, so to call back around 3:00...which we did and we were in our room at about 3:30. And for the record, we did not get the room upgrade (they said they were booked) nor did we get a welcome gift....so just realize that when you book a package through Perfect Escapes you may not get all extras - it's completely based on hotel availability (which most likey they will tell you there is no availability.) Know that when you walk in you go all the way through the sitting area and the check-in is to the left. There are a few computers available for use by the sitting area, but when we were there several were not working. I don't remember the situation with wi-fi....I don't believe it's in the room and I believe there is a cost. (Sorry, no help there!) If your room is not ready and you need to use the restroom before you hit the town, they are down one floor...same floor as the fitness center and conference rooms. Anyhoo.....Our room was nice, roomy and clean. King bed, two night stands, a table and two chairs and a desk with a chair (also where the TV sits.) Nice size closet with an iron and board (a plus for me!) and a safe. The bathroom was large with lovely marble...a separate tub and shower and lots of space on the sink area for two people's stuff. The bed was super comfy and the bedding was really nice. Lots of towels in the bath and great L'Occtaine products! Didn't hear outside noise, but it seemed that we could hear everything the people said in the next room. I'm thinking there may have been some alcohol involved there, so perhaps they were just really loud (and not a thin wall problem)....but they were only there one night so after that it was just fine. We were happy to find out that our free breakfast could be in their Gaby restaurant or room service...so we took advantage of the room service each morning. The food always arrived in a reasonable time, was always hot and always very good. We tried several different items and literally, all of them were good....but my favorite - their chocolate croissants! YUMMY! The hotel is in a great location between 5th and 6th. We walked to most places including Times Square, Bryant Park, Rockefellar Center and of course, great shopping! Overall we enjoyed our stay and I would recommend this hotel. The concierge was helpful, the valet guys were really nice and the maids did a great job. I would say the only staffers I didn't get the warm fuzzies from were the folks at check-in / check-out....which is unusual for a Sofitel. I would think they would want to make the best first and final impressions. There are lots of places to stay in NYC, so sometimes the little things (like a smile!) DO make a big difference.

The hotel is right in the middle of everything - my husband and I didn't need to take a taxi/subway our entire stay. Entrance: Note that the check-in is through the lobby and to the left. All we saw when we first walked in was the concierge desk - we couldn't see the check-in desk. The hotel is very nice looking. We had room 922 - a suite - which was fairly large. The only downsides I noticed about the suite was a grate that seemed to be missing in the closet and I was looking for something like a small fridge. The layout of the suite is perfect - you enter in a little hallway, and then can choose to go left through a LARGE closet to the bathroom or bedroom or straight on to the sitting area. From the sitting area, you can go into the bedroom. Both the bedroom and sitting room had nice TVs and were bigger than some NY apartments. The closet was large and contained a large shelf to place your suitcase on. The bathroom had both a tub and nice shower, plus more than ample room on the counter. The hotel staff were extremely nice. I don't normally like the cleaning staff touching my things, but the one evening when we returned, my toiletries were arranged so perfectly (by size and in a nice triangle!) that even someone who's slightly compulsive like me loved it. The room was very quiet - I never really heard anything from the outside. (Although there was a strange thump that we never quite figured out! It sounded like something hitting our window.) We had free internet - and the desk in the sitting room even contained an ethernet cord in case you forget yours. While we stayed, we received a note saying the hotel was upgrading its wireless, so I'm sure there's that to look forward to as well.

But as far as we're concerned, we've found perfection at Sofitel, and for all our future New York excursions, that's where we plan to stay.

The bathrooms are all marble and done with great taste. The amenities in the bathroom are great there are Q-tips, nail filer, and many other things which women would use. The room has three phones and a 32 inch flat screen TV which is very nice. I would NOT recommend eating at the Sofitel the prices are outrageous even for New York. I mean $25 for cup of fruit? That's a bit crazy. For brunch I would recommend going to Cookshop, 44X Hells Kitchen, Pastis, Cafe Orlin etc. Right outside of the hotel is a place called DB Bistro Moderne. The place is known for $32 burger so if you want to splurge and do something different go there. There is also a 24 hour Duane Reade (Convenience Store / Pharmacy) right around the corner from the hotel which has pretty much everything a person in the hotel would want so you always have that option.

One room was not ready by 3pm as advertised but this was not a problem as we could use the other one for the time being. Did not encounter any problems until late on the second night when my daughters were locked out of their room at 12.30am. Reception told them this was due to a declined credit card (the hotel reserves the full amount for your room upon arrival and as both rooms were not available when we arrived, they did not discover this until after we had collected the key for the second room) and as the hotel were unwilling to let them back into their room unless they could take payment there and then (management were not interested that it was late and was 5.30am in the UK) we had to call the credit card company. At no point did the hotel staff contact us during the day to inform us of the problem, even though we had been in our rooms for over 2 hours of the day. Their first response to this issue was to lock the room regardless of the time of night. NB. there was no issue with the card, only with the two large transactions processed in New York in quick succession. There were still problems with the lock on the room after we had resolved the issue and my daughters had to be let in by security. By this time it was after 1.30am. They were again locked out of the room the following day (apparently the key cards play up frequently) and so we asked to speak to management. The manager was obviously well trained on how to deal with complaints and promised free breakfast, late check-out (great if we hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already heard them offer other guests late check-out for no extra charge) and a reduced room rate.

I chose Sofitel New York because of previous reviews from other TripAdvisor customers as well as my last stay at the Sofitel Le Fauborg last year in Paris. The latter was magnificent. But that was Paris. The Sofitel in New York had a French flair - from breakfast to dinner - and the room was quaint and had a separate shower. Most of the staff had a French accent to their English language, which gave it a touch of the French boutique. And the bath products were L Occitane, service water was Evian - so how more European could you get? But where the European ambiance ends, the American service begins. Of course, this is the USA - where the front desk people need to entertain every customer like there is no sense of time or space. Every inquiry, even if takes 30 minutes is addressed. Where you need to call the guest services to kindly please add another bottle of lotion because the last one they gave was like 2 days ago and 2 of us were sharing the teenie weenie bottle. Like it takes a lot of effort to put up a smile on their faces, unlike La Fauborg. And unlike La Fauborg, the food was bland and there were very few fruit choices (come to think of it, none at all, unless picking up an apple in the lobby was what you were looking for.) Like the concierge service closes early and was not that useful at all because there was either one or two or no one at the concierge area. Like there was a night that I had to ask them to turn down the beds and bring up some water, but nobody came until we did that ourselves. It was a nice luxury hotel, situated a few blocks from Times Square and a stone's throw away from 5th Avenue. The hotel was nice, but the service was by far below my expectations.

The location is great and the rooms are always well appointed and comfortable. On my last trip at check in I was informed that they had me booked into a queen room. Now I was pretty sure I had booked a king room and when I inquired to the desk he stated that unless I had my confirmation I was out of luck because that was the room I was assigned. As I looked into my file for the reservation details I began remember this happening to me on my last visit...and the one before. The point beeing I think they activly downgrade you if you don't object or have proof of the room class you booked. I found my reservation (king) and presented it to him. Now he was asking if I minded a queen room because he could not find me a king room because they were full. When I told him this happend last time I stayed here and I wanted to speak to a manager he suddenly was able to find a room (but only one on the 3rd floor). I left feeling like it was a concerted effort to push clients into lower classes of rooms. The next day in talking to the bellman I asked if they were booked full and he said no, somewhere close to 85%.", "Date": "June 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Walnut Creek, California", "Title": "\u201cVery Pleased With Sofitel New York\u201d", "Author": "Bowdoin1", "ReviewID": "UR66793759", "Content": "Spent 5 nights at the Sofitel New York in a junior suite on the 26th floor and was very pleased with our stay. From check-in to check-out the service was friendly and excellent. The doormen were quick to help with luggage and secure taxis--even at 4:30 in the morning. Check-in and check-out were effortless. The housekeeping staff were quick and did a great job. The suite was a nice size with a separate foyer, living/work area, bedroom and bathroom. The bed, as everyone has stated before, is excellent and the bathroom is fitted with nice towels and L'Occitane products. The room had two flat screen tvs, a a Bose alarm clock/radio, a stereo in the living room and plently of storage space. The only negatives about the room were the lack of a mirror in the foyer (obviously not a big deal) and a loud vent in the bathroom that was solved simply by keeping the door to the bathroom closed at night. Turndown service was prompt and the bottles of Evian on the nightstand each night was a nice touch. The only negative was the service in the bar in that the waiter made a couple of mistakes on a simple order but it was not a big deal. The location is excellent--on 44th Street between 5th and 6th (Ave. of the Americas). Times Square. the Broadway Theaters, MOMA, Bryant Park, and Rockefeller Center are only 5 minutes away as a ret wo subway stations. Although right in the heart of midtown, the area is quiet and it was easy to get a good nice sleep. The clientele seemed to be split pretty evening between tourists and businesspeople with a number of european language overhead in the lobby. The lobby is quite nice with a gorgeous floral display, several free internet termianals and comfortable leather chairs. We have stayed at Sofitels in London, Chicago, Siem Riep Cambodia and Los Angeles and have always been pleased with my stays and the New York location is no different. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking to stay a (reasonably) affordable, top-notch hotel in mid-town with a little (emphasis on little) European flare.", "Date": "June 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA lovely sanctuary in mid-town - not disappointed in the least\u201d", "Author": "Maplehawk", "ReviewID": "UR66524822", "Content": "A very nicely appointed hotel, well located, very clean & quiet.

When I first emailed the hotel I received a near immediate reply from Sandra, who I now understand is the Reservations Manager. I had contacted a few different hotels but this felt right and I had a good feeling. Boy! Was I right! I explained to Sandra that this was our first trip to NY and we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. I was offered an upgrade with my request of a high floor be noted. They could not promise a really high floor, but they would do their best. After our flight with Virgin Atlantic (first time we have upgraded to Premium Economy and it was worth it. Good entertainment, better food, lots of room, dedicated toilet for just Premium Economy passengers, get on first, get off first and most importantly - your luggage comes off first!). After taking a taxi to the hotel from the airport (don't listen to people who say they were ripped off - if you come out of JFK to the taxi rank, a taxi rolls up and the fare is fixed $50 includes the tolls - the tip is up to you). We arrived at the hotel. The hotel is on a quiet street, just round the corner from Times Square. The main thing is that it is quiet. If like us, this is the first time you have been to NY, the honking of horns is quite a surprise and having a hotel that diminishes the noise, is worth it's weight in gold - this is from a couple from London - so we know noise! The room we were given was a huge suite on the 29th (top) floor! Our mouths dropped open and we just walked around saying Oh My G-d!!! We have been fortunate enough to have stayed in some lovely hotels around the world, but for a city hotel, we simply did not expect such a huge room. There were two thermostats, one in the lounge and one in the bedroom. The bedroom had a table and chairs in and the lounge room (totally separate room) has an armchair, a sofa, huge plasma tv at one end and a writing desk and chair at another. In the hallway and the lounge there were also large pieces of lovely furniture. There was also a dressing area with a large shelf for cases, two wardrobes and plenty of room to move around in between. In one of the wardrobes was an ironing board and iron, a stand for cases and plenty of hangers. Plenty of lights and lamps, so the rooms could be well lit if needed. The bathroom was large and well appointed. A good hairdryer that worked as well as mine at home. The bathrobes were fluffy and felt like new. More towels than we needed. Really nice slippers. The L'Occtaine shower gel, soaps, shampoo and conditioner were replaced each and every day. Two bottles of Evian water were left out each day free of charge, when the turndown service was done. The room was immaculate, with no signs of wear and tear. The bedding is another wonderful story. I have Egyptian cotton sheets and pillow cases at home as I love the feel of them. I buy from John Lewis and they cost a fortune, but they were not as soft as the ones on the hotel bed. The bed had a downy mattress topper which simply melted as you lay upon it. I took great delight each night after a bath or shower just diving under the sheets. The bed was massive. The pillows so soft and fluffy it was like sleeping on a cloud. When we came back to our room after the first afternoon out, we were delighted to see a cake with strawberries left in the room with the compliments of the hotel. A wonderful touch. I do not have anything negative to say about the hotel or their staff. I really cannot understand any negative remarks as the points made were simply not true to our experience. The reception staff fall over themselves to help - as if we were royalty or suchlike. We constantly asked the concierge questions as to the best place to eat and we were recommended some superb restaurants. Each day we said what kind of food we wanted to eat and what level of casual/smart we wanted to be. Each time the concierge would write down recommendations, addresses and made reservation where applicable. We asked reception if we could pay to use a printer for our boarding cards as we were checking out online (I have a Blackberry, so I cannot comment on the hotel's internet connection). I was told to speak to the concierge, who printed out all the information free of charge. We checked out before the 12 noon check out time and our bags were held (free of charge) by the Bell hop staff in a secure room until we were ready to go to the airport. We simply gave them a tip at the end. Tipping: This seems to be a big talking point with UK visitors as most of us do not want to seem flashy (or can afford to be) but we do not want to appear miserly. In a restaurant we tipped between 15% to20% of the total bill cost depending on how wonderful the service was. Taxis had no more than 15% and staff what we felt like. The Dollar rate for us is poor, so we tipped to staff what we would like to receive if the roles were reversed. It is part of the culture and if your service from a waitress for example was bad, don't give a lot as you would be unlikely to go there again anyway! I hope I have conveyed to you how wonderful an experience this hotel made our trip. I would welcome any questions and have no problem recommending this hotel to anyone at any age. The fact that we were charged a room rate of a lowly double and had a suite, well, that was luck and wonderfully received, even at full price, this was amazing value.", "Date": "June 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Laguna Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel with great location with good value\u201d", "Author": "Harrya909", "ReviewID": "UR66264558", "Content": "It is a perfect hotel for someone visiting NYC for the very first time or for someone who wants to stay in midtown and around all the buzz of the city.

This trip was a combination of both. Usually when I travel I stay at Starwood hotels and have stayed at the Westin and almost every W hotel in New York. I have also stayed in the Mrriot Marquis, the Millineum, the Plaza, the Four Seasons, several modern boutique hotels and some other 4 and 5 star hotels over the years. This trip was during fleet week so the hotel I wanted to stay in was booked. Since I had stayed at my first Sofitel in Philadelphia recently and had a good experience (they gave us a suite for the standard rate because all of their standard rooms were booked) I booked the New York Sofitel through Perfect Escapes. I booked a standard queen room that came with a guaranteed upgrade (upon availability), early check in, late check out, and free breakfast. I arrived at around 1 pm and they checked me right in to a large suite on the 26th floor (not a junior suite) which had a great view of the Chrysler building and where a welcome card awaited me. The room was really nice, had plenty of closet space, and was very quiet. Everything was really clean, no foul smells, and no wear and tear was apparent. I love the Sofitel feather beds and our bed had both down and synthetic pillows already on it. At turn down we were left with a large glass bottle of Evian and two small plastic bottles in addition to a box of chocolates. The towels were replaced, the music was turned on, the drapes were closed in both the living room and the bedroom, and certain lights were turned on. The bathroom had a fresh orchid and candles for around the tub. The water pressure in our room was really good so I cannot explain why others have had problems with it. Room service was fast and efficient and not anymore expensive than I had paid elsewhere. The concierge was polite and helpful and our wake up calls were exactly as requested, I do not care that it was a recording. The gym was small but well equipped. I ALWAYS put my valuables in the safe (which this room was equipped with) and would not leave money unsecured in a hotel room. It doesn't matter the class of the hotel, thefts occur everywhere, so I did not have any issues with items missing from our room. Breakfast was good and at the end of it the waiter discreetly told me that I would not get a check because my breakfast was included in my rate. I inquired about the gratuity and he said that was taken care of. I was left alone all day and never asked when I would be leaving which has happened to me before when I have had late check outs at other hotels. They did not slip a bill under my door which I think is great. At check out I was asked to confirm my charges and then I was given a copy. Overall I found the service to be very good but not great. The bell men do not greet you like they do at other hotels but I received exemplary service everywhere else. The decor is not modern and clean like a W but I found it very attractive.

Despite us arriving after 3pm, our room was not ready and we had to wait in the bar whilst housekeeping got it ready. Ok, we were given a complimentary drink but after a long flight and wanting to get outside and explore straightaway this was an inconvenience. However, after about 30 minutes our room was ready. As I hadn't paid a great deal for it, I was not expecting it to be as good as it was. The beds were amazing - so comfortable after a very hectic day and the bathroom was fabulous. L'Occitane toiletries added that extra special touch. The location of the hotel is excellent as its between 5th Avenue and Times Square and everything seemed to be in close proximity.

When I travel, it's either a Kimpton property or a Sofitel for me. So I was looking forward to my stay at the Sofitel NY, especially given the raves on Trip Advisor. Let me go through my pros and cons: Pros Location, location, location. If you want central, this is great. Check-in. Fastest check-in ever. I gave them my name and credit card and ID, they gave me my key. Concierge. She was a savant. I approached her around 9:30 a.m. on Thursday morning and asked her a barrage of questions. Each one was answered immediately, along with directions. (I wanted a manicure/pedicure, needed a drug store, and felt like having a burger for dinner) Gym: This is a great gym. I didn't get a chance to count all the equipment, but there were at least two bikes, a few treadmills, and a few ellipticals. Plus a lot of weights. Also, the gym is free. Bath products: L'Occitane. Nice. Bath sheets. I'm a sucker. Cons Room service. On my second night, I wanted a snack and some wine. I ended up paying $57 for a cheeseplate and a carafe. I compare this to the Kimpton hotels, where the drinks are free from 5 to 6 and there's often cheese and crackers and well, Sofitel just doesn't stack up. (Kimpton also has better mini-bar snacks.) Wireless. I couldn't get the T-mobile hotspot to work, and I consider myself a frequent user and fairly technologically savvy. There was an Ethernet cable in the desk drawer, so I used this instead and never contacted them. Ice machine. There were signs for one on the 3rd floor, but it seriously looked like godzilla had ripped it out of the floor. In-room mini-bar: Warm. Enough said. Bed: Definitely could tell that many people had slept there before me. Someone needs to turn these mattresses. Big dip on one side. Price: Ouch. In short, this was a pleasant hotel.

The hotel was everything I had hoped. Its located in the very heart of Mid Town, two blocks from the Theater District and Times Square. But for all that its incredibly quiet. The lobby area is very nice, very European and very comfortable. Check in was quick and friendly, in that French way. The concierge was also quick and efficient with our bags, they were in our room within 5 minutes of getting our keys. Bellman happily helped me get some ice immediately and arranged our heavy cases for us so they were in the right places. And I mean happily. Room service was quick, very tasty and good sized serves. Ok, its expensive, but the quality was certainly there and with the added extras one expects from Sofitel, bread basket, yummy butter and plenty of chilled water. Again all done with a smile. Needed a cup of tea after dinner and a whole day of travel. No kettle or coffee maker in the room. Called down, was told that there were none available until morning but that they would send up hot water and cups immediately, at no cost. Very impressive service for midnight. Had some minor issues with television and internet not working. Maintenance were there in minutes and everything was fixed within 10 minutes. The bed was heavenly. Nothing more needs to be said. The room was extremely quiet, a blessing given the usual New York Symphony of fire trucks, ambulances, police cars and garbage trucks one usually has to put up with. We were on the 20th floor but even so it was so silent we both had our best nights sleep in a long long time. The room was also very clean, as was the bathroom. The bathroom was very well appointed and there was gallons of hot hot water. There are two options here for the internet. The wired internet service is $10 but cuts out at 1200hrs regardless of what time you purchased your 1 x day. The other is a T-Mobile Hotspot, that also works out to about $10 but it does not cut out, gives you a full 24 hours. I found little difference in speed between the two and the T-Mobile one could be used in the lobby, so that was an advantage. We asked for a late check out, which is always tricky in a big city, the hotel accommodated us for a reasonable compromise, gave us an extra couple of hours. Returned later in the day ahead of a midnight flight and relaxed in their very cosy lobby. All in all, one of the most pleasant hotel experiences I have had in New York.

Fly out of Heathrow not feeling sorry for anyone that booked with the failing airline that is BA. Arrived in JFK airport and took cab $45 dollar set fee with $5 additional toll charge to hotel. Warmly welcomed and the efficient porters took our luggage straight from the cab. We got a room on the 21st floor - partly due to emailing the hotel requesting a high room as it was our anniversary (nearly). Room was an upgraded superior queen and still quite small compared to others. Large LCD tv - chargable mini bar but no kettle / tea / coffee. Then found out that free coffee available every morning from room near to restaurant. Hotel is in a great position around 4 minute walk from Times Square and therefore central to all the major attractions. Ate out for breakfast lunch and dinner as alot cheaper than hotel prices. Saw all the attractions Central Park with the boating lake was very nice. Empire State Building - no queues and definately one of the best things we did. Shopping a bit over rated - paid to go to Woodbury Common outlet a 40 min bus ride - if you want to save hundreds of pounds but having to pay thousands then maybe the designer outlets are for you. The only bargain I found was Superdry coat for \u00c2\u00a3100 (Uk \u00c2\u00a3150) and Timberland boots \u00c2\u00a360 (Uk \u00c2\u00a3130) Statue Of Liberty and Ellis island amazing Coyote Ugly bar - pretty wild - barmaids dancing on the bar and owner trying to fight suited americans. Avenue Q show - great entertainment. Bubba Gump food was ok but not a patch on the ribs and chicken at the ESPN Zone both on Times Square.

I must say, it was worth every penny. The rooms were large and very light with a tv in both bedroom and lounge area. The bed was so so soft and comfy and the pillows as well. A nice little welcome touch was a small box of chocolates on the table as we entered. I loved the separate areas including a dressing area. You could shut off all the separate areas as well so if one wanted to retire early you could shut all the areas down so if one of you wanted to stay out/up late, you would not disturb the other when coming into the room. The bathroom was a delight and it was nice to have a separate bath and shower. The in room safe was big enough for a laptop. Fresh bottles of water appeared every day as well which was a godsend. The sofa was comfy too. There was a nice turn down service where the maid put the radio on so there were nice sounds as you entered the room. Had me fooled on the first night, though there was a burglar in the room!! Check in was fast and so was checkout. The conceirge service, depending on who was on, was a little hit and miss. The doormen were delightful and it was a novelty having them open the door for me when I went in and out and a nice touch. My one and only complaint, and this is really pushing it, is that there were no tea and coffee making facilities in the room. Found it irritating that I had to get dressed and go out of the building to get that early morning shot. There was room service, but too overpriced for my liking. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel, too pricey for us, but there was a lovely diner just a hop skip and a jump from the hotel that did a fast and good service for about half the price of the hotel. All the staff were courteous and friendly and when I had a fall the day before we were due to leave the hotel, they allowed us to stay in the suite until it was time to leave for our plane ride home without charge.

Even the stormy weekend (and non-stop rain) couldn't ruin my trip this time. One small tip (and it is! - I think every other review has mentioned something) - it's much quicker to exit the hotel through Gaby's restuarant exit if you're going anywhere north of 44th St. It cuts a block out and you can cover another block under cover if your visit happens to coincide with the worst storms for years....! lol", "Date": "March 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cLooking forward to returning\u201d", "Author": "Faberge", "ReviewID": "UR58966510", "Content": "This week, my husband and I spent a few days at the Sofitel on our first pleasure trip to New York.

Since I was forced to attend meetings in a Times Square hotel, this property was a perfect blend of 'close enough' but not too close to the tourist masses. The hotel itself is very lovely. All of the common areas look recently updated but keeping the feel of a classic European decor. Check-in was smooth and friendly, and all of the staff members I encountered during my stay were very pleasant. The gym was also well equipped and large enough to be usable with multiple guests using the facilities. My room on the 12th floor was surprisingly large for a NYC hotel. Luxuriously appointed in right browns, golds and reds, all of the now-standard amenities were present (Bose alarm, in room safe, LCD tv, sitting area). The queen bed was very comfortable and only made better by the excellent fabric fittings. In the bath, a glass walk-in shower, large tub, and marble floors and counter made the luxury experience complete. Again, this hotel holds the gold standard for NYC in my book.

I had stayed there twice before on business trips and loved the hotel. The rooms are very clean and comfortable, and I have always felt relaxed and at ease staying there. The rooms are very quiet and have every amenity you could want-- including my favorite: slippers. They are a bit small, but hey, it's NYC. We arrived early on Friday afternoon and our room wasn't ready yet, so we stashed our bags with the concierge and wandered around the neighborhood and grabbed some lunch. The location is perfect-- walking distance to Times Square and Central Park (if you're up for a nice walk), and convenient to the subway. When we returned, our room was ready and they offered to bring our bags to the room. Unfortunately the BCBG bag containing my brand new gown for the black tie affair and shawl was missing. The staff returned to our room 10 minutes later with a BCBG bag, but it wasn't mine. It only took a few minutes for us to realize that another guest must have my bag by mistake. The staff responded immediately, accepted responsibility, was very apologetic and focused on remedying the situation, i.e. find me a dress to wear a few hours later. Brooke from the concierge desk called the room and offered to send someone to the BCBG store to replace my dress. I had to shorten the gown significantly and take-in the top, so I knew there was no way I could purchase the same gown. I asked if I could just go to the store myself and find a new dress. Brooke was amazing-- she called BCBG and arranged to have a sales person greet us and help me find a new dress for the wedding. She also told me that if I couldn't find a dress that fit without alterations at BCBG to go to any store and just find a dress and bring the receipt back to the Sofitel. Brooke also offered to make me appointments for hair and make-up, and offered us a car service for that evening. I was impressed-- they were definitely going above and beyond what needed to be done. All I wanted was a dress to wear, but we were greatly appreciative of how attentive and willing they were to provide us with all of those additional services at no cost to us. In addition to Brooke, the hotel manager Katherine was also incredibly helpful. When we returned to the hotel with a new dress, Katherine met us in the lobby and apologized for the mix-up. She took the receipt and said that she would take it to their accounting department and let us know how we would be reimbursed. We returned at the end of the evening to a voicemail message from her saying that they would FedEx me a check ASAP. We returned last night from NY, so I'm still waiting for the check and can't comment on how quickly it was sent. I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with how quickly Katherine and Brooke apologized and worked to remedy the situation. Nowadays, it's so rare to find such high quality customer service like we experienced. Can you imagine an airline doing any of this for a lost bag? Obviously it would have been nice not to have the stress of a missing dress right before a wedding (yikes!), but it was handled in the best manner possible considering the circumstances, and I have no complaints. The other guest did return my bag the next day and I was able to get my original dress back too! Despite the misplacement of my bag, I would absolutely stay at the Sofitel again and highly recommend it to anyone for both business and personal travel. They showed that they are truly a 5 star hotel in the way they reacted and resolved this problem. The staff, especially Katherine and Brooke, were gracious throughout our stay.

First let me say we have stayed at the Sofitel in Miami and London - both impressed us and the reviews on this website of the Sofitel in New York encouraged us to stay here in New York. I have stayed in New York numerous times and this was by far the best value for your money. We stayed at the W midtown last time and paid almost double for a bathroom that you could not close the door when sitting on the toilet - so we were very happy with the size and quality of this hotel room. Great location and wonderful rooms. Nice restaurant and a GREAT gym. Staff was wonderful with one exception. Here is my story. I had paid for two rooms - a junoir suite and a king room side by side as we were travelling with our 5 yr old, my mom and my sister in law to celebrate my mom's bday. The plan was to put myself and my daughter on the sofa bed in the suite, my mom to have the king bed and my sister in law the other king room. Check in was a breeze and at midnight, I went to pull out the sofa bed for the night only to find that the sofa was in fact not a sofa bed. A call down to front desk and I was told that yes, I was guaranteed a sofa bed, and they would figuure out something for the night and then move us in the morning. It was after 1am when I finally went downstairs to get an answer of how they were going to deal with this problem. The front desk clerk clearly did not know what to do (he discovered they had no more rollaway beds in the entire hotel) but was trying his best. The evening manager sauntered over and told me my mom would have to sleep curled up on the couch with some blankets as they had no alternative - I quickly replied that my mom was 60 years old and would not sleep curled up on a couch - he would find her another room for the night and then sort this out in the morning - he could not have been more displeased with this but DID give us the other room for the night - very sourly and without apology. A TOTAL JERK and not someone who should be dealing with the public. My mom went to bed in her new room and was fine - we felt we would resolve everything in the am. In the morning the AMAZING day manager approached us - very apologetic and clearly very embarassed over what we had dealt with the night before and suggested my mom take the complementary room for the entire length of our stay. We were so surprised and shocked - we thought one of us would be sleeping in a rollaway for the entire 5 nights - he also sent up a cake to my mom wishing her a happy 60th and some chocolates to us for the inconvenience. I have told EVERYONE about this as I feel this is what the hospitality industry is about - making people have an unbelievable experience and remembering them - I will always recommend any Sofitel now because of this young mans actions. It was already a lovely hotel, but he went out of his way to make it an UNBELIEVABLE hotel and a great, great experience for us. I am hoping the General Manager reads these comments and promotes this guy because he understands the business - we are already planning a trip that will involve another Sofitel.

We arrived after midnight because of our late Long Island wedding reception. The check-in was quick and our bags arrived within 15 minutes of us getting into the room. I knew the room was not exactly what we book (low with no view), but was too tired to say anything...so we crashed (well, as much as you crash on your wedding night) and started our first full day as a marrying couple. After a restful night we got up to begin our day in Manhattan. On our way out of the hotel we stopped by the desk and just mentioned how we had booked a high room (and that I called to let them know we would be super late for check-in, they told us we would have a high room with a view because it was our honeymoon) and they not only rectified the problem, but they moved our bags while we were out and upgraded us! Our second night was just a comfortable as the first (yes, even the rooms with no view are super comfortable). The bathroom was nice, the L'Occitane products were great, and the bed...oh the bed...it was so comfortable. The concierge was always busy, but never overlooked any guest. I had a deep desire for some authentic NY bagels for breakfast on the morning of our check-out, so I had to ask.

It was everything I expected of a city centre hotel and it made my stay in New York a real pleasure. Having Platinum status in A-Club, I am entitled to an upgrade, but there was no upgrade availability on my first night. Fortunately, a suite then became available and I moved in on my second night. The basic rooms are much nicer than anywhere else I've stayed in New York, especially the bathrooms which are often badly designed in New York hotels but perfect in the Sofitel. The suites are even more impressive - very spacious and extremely comfortable. I found nearly all the staff to be extremely helpful, especially the check-in staff and the concierge. The general attitude of the staff is one of flexibility and trying to accommodate guests' wishes, and I felt like a valued customer. For example, on my last day, they offered to let me check out of my suite at 5pm instead of the 4pm late checkout I was entitled to. The hotel's location was perfect for me, as I was travelling on business but stayed an extra day for sightseeing and shopping. So many of the places I wanted to visit were within walking distance, and I found the Sofitel to be right in the middle of everything. The thermostats in the rooms work very well and allow you set the desired temperature to anything you want - including in Celsius (probably the French influence). The room warms up very quickly if you're too cold. There's no point in using the wired internet, which costs $10 until noon no matter how soon before noon you start using it. Instead use the T-Mobile wireless internet which works throughout the hotel so you can take your laptop anywhere. You can get a wireless voucher from the front desk for $10 (easier if you're travelling on business) or $8 if you buy it online with a credit card, and it lasts a full 24 hours rather than only until noon. Both the wired and wireless internet are just under 3Mbps downstream and upstream, so it can get a little slow when lots of users are using it at the same time. The safe was just big enough for my 15.4\" laptop. My only criticism was the television channels. There are no international news channels (e.g. BBC World, Deutsche Welle etc), so you won't easily be able to keep up with what's going in in the outside world. Even CNN is the domestic US version. However, to be fair to Sofitel this is a general problem in New York hotels, and they do offer TV5 for French speakers. I resorted to streaming BBC news on my laptop, and gave up using the two televisions in my suite, which was a shame given that they were large and modern.

An added bonus was bumping into the tallest man in the world who was also staying in the hotel at the time! Hotel also gave us a later check out too when we asked. One other point I would mention is that the lobby has 3 computers with free internet access and this was a real bonus so no need to pay for internet unless of course you want it in the privacy of your own room.", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cFabulous hotel\u201d", "Author": "gertie990", "ReviewID": "UR45378525", "Content": "Truly had a 5 star experience.

This was my first trip to the USA and first stay at a Sofitel. One word, perfection. The hotel is beautiful, the lobby spacious and a quite cocoon from the hustle and bustle of New York. I arrived 30 minutes prior to check in after a transatlantic flight from London. I was tired, fed-up and needed a shower. I was met by an ice queen, who, told me to come back in half an hour. Not a good start. However upon return, a new receptionist. She acknowledged my A-Club card and gave complimentary drinks vouchers and an upgraded room. Shortly after going up to the room I was given some chocolates and water as a welcome gift, they also allowed a 4pm late check-out. The room was spacious and had stunning views of the Manhattan sky line. It was cleaned twice daily and was always immaculate; the turn down service was outstanding. Water, chocolates, bathroom cleaned and classical music playing upon my return. Maid service was discreet, never once saw a cleaning cart. Ate at Gaby every morning for breakfast, whilst this was expensive it really was divine. The oatmeal with caramelised bananas was out of this world. Coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice was refilled constantly. If you are deliberating over a hotel, stop, and book this. It really is pure perfection.

We arrived at 2:30pm, slightly short of the suggested 3pm check-in time, and our room wasn't ready yet. The reception staff kindly offered to take our luggage off our hands, which allowed us to wander around the immediate area and find somewhere for a coffee to kill time. Conveniently, turning left out of the hotel and walking to the first intersection, you find yourself on 5th Avenue, with a Starbucks just on the other side. Returning to the hotel at 3pm, we found the room was still not ready, but \"shouldn't be more than another 15 minutes\". This time we waited in the very comfortable lobby area. There are 3 PCs here with free internet access which we used sporadically throughout our stay. They're often busy, but never for long. At 3:20pm we went back to reception again. This time the receptionist phoned through to housekeeping and \"had words\". It was suggested we come back at 4pm and perhaps visit the hotel bar, Gaby's, while we wait. Alternatively there was a room available on floor 15. However, my partner had paid for an upgrade to a \"Superior\" room (basically a high floor with a good view) so it would've been a waste to sacrifice this out of impatience. Plus a drink is always welcome, so we went to the bar. The prices in Gaby's were quite high. An order of two Malibu & pineapple juice came to $20 - plus state tax, plus the seemingly obligatory tip. Ouch. We returned to reception at 4pm and, hurrah, 3rd time lucky - the room was ready, and we got our key cards. The receptionist was was friendly & helpful, taking time to explain where everything was in the building. On attempting to reclaim our luggage, she explained that it will follow us up shortly. The Sofitel has 4 lifts serving all 29 floors. During the entire stay, we never had to wait more than 15 seconds for one to arrive. Also, once inside the lift, we got to our floor (27) very very fast. As we approached the room, the maid was still finishing off, so we lingered outside for another few minutes before being able to enter. It was well worth the wait though... What a beautiful room - and huge too. It wasn't a suite, but an incredibly large bedroom. The view was towards the Chrysler building and was breathtaking. The bed was large with 4 luxurious pillows, there were 2 single wardrobes - one either side of a desk area which housed a 32\" LG HDTV, on one of the bedside tables was a Bose wave radio, and there were plenty of drawers for storage too. An additional cupboard housed a safe, some drinking glasses, two bathrobes, two pairs of disposable slippers, and some laundry bags. There was also a small cupboard containing a minibar. The bathroom contained a glass walk-in shower big enough for two (ahem) as well as a separate bath tub, the sink surround was beautiful brown marble, the toiletries supplied were luxurious (L'Occitane), and the fluffy towels provided were more than enough for two people. There was even a small orchid in front of the bathroom mirror which was replaced each day, as well as a tealight candle with matches. The toilet had a couple of fine cracks inside the bowl, but that doesn't really matter - I'm sure it's seen bigger cracks in its time... About 5 minutes after settling into the room, a porter brought our luggage to the room. 10 minutes later, another porter brought in some champagne that my partner had ordered as a birthday treat. This wasn't just delivered, but poured into the glasses for us - nice touch. As he was leaving, a housekeeping manager arrived to check that everything was to our liking - which it was. Just when we thought there were no more visitors, another porter turned up after a further 15 minutes. At the point of the champagne being ordered, they'd asked if a note should be included. This was requested to say \"Happy Birthday\", etc. Obviously the staff had seen this and, realising it was for a birthday, this final porter had been sent up to deliver a complimentary cheesecake with the words \"Happy Birthday\" written on the plate in chocolate sauce. This was incredibly kind, and a wonderful start to our stay. Over the 4 nights we were there, we found the bed to be one of the most comfortable we'd ever slept in. The bed itself was firm to medium, and the big soft pillows completely envelop your head. Being on a high floor with a well soundproofed room, meant we had absolutely zero noise from outside. We barely heard a peep from any of the other adjoining rooms either. This, coupled with the fact that the bedroom curtains completely black out the room when drawn, ensured blissful sleep on every single night. As already said above, turning left out of the hotel leads you to the shops of 5th Avenue. Once on 5th, turn right and walk 2 blocks to 42nd Street. If you want Grand Central Station, turn left and walk a few blocks. Alternatively, turn right to find your nearest Subway stop. If you turn right out of the hotel and walk for 2 blocks, you'll instead come to Times Square. So either way, you're smack bang in the middle of everything, with easy access to the Subway. Perfect location for a short leisure break. The main negative regarding the hotel is the cost of food and drink. As already mentioned, the drinks cost a lot in Gaby's when compared to other bars - although you kind of expect this of a luxurious international hotel chain. The minibar prices were equally steep, but again not a surprise. The real stinger however is the cost of room service. Like all hotels, you expect the room service menu to have inflated prices as you're paying for convenience - and this is no exception. However, on top of inflated prices, there is a mandatory service charge of 17%, plus a $3.50 tray charge. I'm used to seeing a service charge OR a tray charge, but never both. Once you've then added on the state tax and any tip you feel obliged to give the porter, you're talking a hefty cost for convenience. For example, start with an $18 breakfast, double it so you have one each, add all the charges in, and you've spent about $50! The one saving grace is that if you're prepared to spend on room service without questioning the cost, then the selection available is very extensive and, if the food that we ate in Gaby's one evening was anything to go by, then it would also be delicious too. Just be forewarned about the costs and know what to expect. Also, talking of Gaby's, as nice as it is in the evenings, there is no segregation between the drinking & dining areas. This resulted in us having a romantic meal on a table next to some loud drunken businessmen. Ah well, it was still good. All things considered however, I wouldn't be doing justice to this fine establishment if I gave them any less than 5*, despite the creative food & drink pricing. The accommodation was excellent, beautiful, clean, comfortable & luxurious, the service was second to none, and the view from the (upgraded) room on the 27th floor was stunning.

When I enquired about the room upgrade at check-in, I was told that the Sofitel will never upgrade you for free, and that I was welcome to pay for one (the Terms and Conditions did state it was subject 'to availability', but seeing as I was offered an upgrade if I paid, I assume there was availability!) After that, I didn't even bother asking about the breakfast. I am not sure who is at fault here, Perfectescapes.com or The Sofitel, but deals like this should not be advertised unless the hotel intends to honour them.

Unfortunately, it didn't live up to those high expectations. The hotel itself is gloomy and, dare I say it, a bit drab. The carpets and furniture is worn. It could definitely do with a refurb. As an a-club Platinum member, I should have been upgraded on arrival; I wasn't (although I was given a late check-out at 4pm as entitled to). The bellboy delivered my bags quickly but rudely, rushing out as soon as I had given him $5, without putting my suitcase on a stand or offering to show me any of the facilities in the room. My room was a decent size (by New York standards) but again could do with freshening up. There wasn't much light, partly because the window was filthy. Internet connection was through a (very short) ethernet cable; no wifi. The shower pressure was low (and the water was boiling hot with the dial well towards blue). The bed was not up to Sofitel's usually wonderful standards; it was lumpy, and short (and I'm only 5'11/1m80). Breakfast - normally a delight at Sofitel - was another disappointment. My expresso was burnt, the orange juice mediocre, the eggs Benedict overcooked, the service surly and harried. On departure (and on another instance), the doorman was too busy to call me a cab or help me with my bags. I had to hail a cab and carry them out in the pouring rain. All in all, I think this hotel is vastly overrated, needs refurbishment, and is cutting corners on service in order to cut costs - not a wise move for a so-called \"luxury\" hotel.

I travelled to NYC with my boyfriend for a leisure trip, sightseeing etc. We stayed from June 20-24th and booked directly via the hotel website. We requested a room on a lower floor as my other half wasn't comfortable sleeping on a high floor (interesting holiday location for us considering this?!). We were allocated a room on floor 9 and stayed in room 904. it was a standard queen sized room which was lovely, not large but big enough with a large flat screen tv and double wardrobes and a nice bose radio system - which we set as an alarm most mornings. The location was fantastic and close to Bryant park (2 blocks) where we got a coach to (Coach USA) from Newark airport for only $50 for both of us as a round trip. I would highly recommend this transfer method as it was good value for money and straightforward. The coach USA pick up point being just across the road from the airport terminal. It was also close to the rockefeller centre, times square etc. We walked everywhere except getting a cab to battery park to cover the downtown area and also got a cab to Harlem to cover the top end of central park. It really is a great central location but on a quiet enough street which felt safe. The hotel lobby was lovely, not overly grand but had fresh flowers, complimentary internet and printer and always smelt beautiful (sounds a funny thing to notice but it really smells gorgeous and made you feel that the hotel was one of luxury that cared about its appearance). We passed several other hotels including the Waldorf - which looked really run down by the way and each time i was pleased with our hotel after making comparisons on location (I was particularly pleased we didn't stay on Times Square as i think the noise would be too much). The bed was soooooo soft as per other reviews - even more comfortable than my bed at home! It was so nice to have a really soft bed to sleep in at night after all the walking that we did. Equally there was a separate bath (although not full sized) and great power shower. The miniature toiletries were a good brand L'Occitane which added an element of luxury too. Hotel staff were really friendly and the concierge generally made good recommendations (except for one night where we were directed to a local pizzeria / italian called Osteria Al Doge which was awful from start to finish!). We were even allowed to order a takeaway pizza \"pie\" to be delivered to our room which was massive & super tasty. On the last day we ordered a picnic basket which was part of our hotel package (current promotion) which was lovely but they did deliver it late and i had to chase it but it didn't alter my overall view of the hotel. I wouldn't eat at the hotel but rather use it as a fantastic base to explore Manhattan. We ate breakfast at the red flame cafe every day as per several other reviewers which was real value for money offering lots of different options for all tastes. It was open from really early which was great for us when we ate as early as 7am some days. It was often full of locals which i always find as a good sign for eateries! I would definitely stay here again if i were to return to Manhattan and would definitely recommend it to friends. I paid around \u00c2\u00a3725 for 4 nights which seemed reasonable for the level of hotel and booking directly gave us no problems. We requested a late check out due to us having an evening flight and this was provided with no problem at all.

The rooms are still spacious and exceptionally quiet, the beds comfortable (with nice sheets and duvet covers -- why don't more hotels replace their awful bedspreads with these?), and the staff friendly and efficient. Unfortunately, our room felt a bit tired and reeked of cigarette smoke, though I was assured that smokers are only allowed on one of the highest floors (why allow them at all?) In addition to the permeating smell, we woke up early one morning to the strong smell of cigarettes drifting in from one of the non-smoking rooms next door. Maybe this is because a lot of Europeans stay here, and they haven't yet realized that smoking causes lung cancer. Every time I walked into the room, I had to turn on the air conditioning and open the window to try to air out the smell of old cigarettes. I should have asked for another room, but doubt it would have been much of an improvement. Our carpet was stained with makeup in one spot and needed a complete replacement, the drapes needed a thorough cleaning, and the chipped finish on the bathroom doors was simply embarrassing for a \"luxury\" hotel. I've had to wash or dry clean all of my clothing since arriving home because everything smelled like a NYC bar before the smoking laws were passed. Disgusting.

The hotel is in a fabulous location in midtown Manhattan, two blocks from Times Square, and one block from 5th Ave. Despite it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central location, west 44th street is not a noisy street. Your experience starts as soon as you arrive by cab and are met by the doormen who take your luggage. Through the revolving doors into the large marble floored lobby and lounge area and on to reception where you are greeted with a friendly Bonjour. We were checked in straight away and our room was ready for us, we went up to the room and our bags followed almost immediately. The reception staff call the bellhops using a bamboo xylophone. Our room was on the 19th floor (1910) and looked towards the Rockefeller Centre. The room was just across the corridor from the lift area, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear them at all. The room was lovely and quiet, and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear any noise from any neighbouring rooms during our stay. The bedroom and bathroom were both lovely and roomy. The bedroom had a seating area and table, a large desk area with a HDTV, lovely comfortable bed and large wardrobe area housing the in-room safe. The granite bathroom had a lovely large sink area with enough space for all of my toiletries. The shower cubicle was roomy, and the shower powerful. I only used the bath for soaking my poor toes after all the NY walking! The hotel staff are there if you need them, friendly but not overpowering. The concierge seemed surly, with his Bluetooth in his ear constantly. As another reviewer has said you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if he was talking to you or on his phone! We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat in the hotel, but noticed the room service prices varied. We breakfasted daily at the Red Flame Diner on the corner of 6th Ave, and can really recommend the Red Flame special Omelette. We ate out a couple of times at Connolly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Irish bar on West 45th between 6th and Broadway. Bubba Gump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Hard Rock Caf\u00c3\u00a9 are good for lunch on Times Square. We bought a 72 hour sightseeing bus ticket from City Sights, buying the ticket at the booth inside Madame Tussauds instead of from one of the guys on the street. The sales guys are everywhere on Times Square, and along with the Gray Line guys will hassle you to buy tickets at any opportunity. All in all, a very nice hotel, in a great location.

I knew all hotels in New York were expensive and did my research finding Sofitel to be offering all I wanted and needed. It was a definite splurge being a solo traveler and paying for the room myself but I wanted a splurge. And boy did I get it. From the moment the door is held open for you to enter you are treated gloriously by all the staff. The lobby is beautiful and the set up with the check in at the back to the side keeps it always calm and relaxing. I got the Superior Queen room and was on the 18th floor. Everything about the room was elegant, beautiful and provided supreme comfort. Everything about the room was there to provide a certain level of quality. The carpet, the furniture, the wood paneling were all of the highest quality. The famous Sofitel bed was amazing. Comfort that can't be explained. The bathroom was luxurious with separate bath/shower and a huge granite sink. There is a makeup mirior and many different lighting options in the room. There are phone lines in both the bedroom and the bathroom as well as adjustable tv audio in each. The Bose clock radio provides exquisite sound and you can attach your ipod to it to play your own music. In all honesty, this was the nicest place I have ever stayed. The entire staff from the concierge/check in to room service and housekeeping were all professional, courteous and most importantly sincere. There was always a pleasant greeting and every time I returned to the hotel it was as if returning home. And the comfort the room provided became my private haven in New York City. I have never been so relaxed and comfortable in a hotel room. Sofitel also remembered that it was my birthday and when I returned to my room the first night there was a huge birthday cheescake with berries saying Happy Birthday. Such an expected touch. And the nightly turndown service was such an added bonus that helped with the relaxation. They would tidy up the room, empty all trash barrels, get the bed ready, leave bottled water, close the drapes and put the Bose on relaxing classical music. I also ate at the Red Flame diner down the street as many have and loved it. great food, great prices. I also got room service 2 nights and it was very reasonably priced and very plentiful. They have a huge room service menu and all food was delectable. I also had 2 meals at Gaby which was elegant and delicious. It is expensive but worth the money if you want a treat. I have only positives for Sofitel and say if you are shopping around for a hotel in New York they are all expensive. if you need to pay a little more to stay at Sofoitel it will be oh so worth it. It is now my New York home and I am returning in July. It is so rare in this day and age to find a hotel that provides quality service, comfort and feels like home. Sofitel does all this down to the point that when I called the front desk they answered the phone saying my name. They knew it was me.

We have stayed there a few times before and have always thought it was a wonderful value for the money. It may still be but we did notice that the service has declined. There was not any one thing that caused us to think this but rather several small (and not-so-small) things that occurred over the course of our stay, First, when we checked in, we were told that my free drink was ready (I am a platinum Accor member) but my husband's was not and so he should just come back the next day to get his drink. Right. Then, when we saw our room we were not given the room we had expected. I know that hotels can rarely guarantee a specific room but, given that we were staying for 8 nights and that I am a Platinum Accor member (which, apparently, is not worth much) and also that we had always received a nice sized luxury king during our past stays. it was what we were expecting. So, we were told that we would get a nicer room the next day and that we should not unpack. The next afternoon we were told that we could not move to the room we were promised because the guest who was currently occupying it refused to leave (very strange story but I guess these things happen). The staff member who relayed this to us was genuinely upset and apologized profusely. So, we were given a room that was larger than the one we had but a bit smaller than the one we were promised. Again, not a big deal as the room was fine but, at this point, we were starting to wonder what was up. The next thing that occurred was that my husband called down to the concierge and was told that the concierge was not available so to just call back the next day. That is, he was not asked what his question was so that someone else might be able to help him. Again, a small thing but just something else to add to the list. The day after we asked the hotel to dry-clean a few things, including my husband's (very expensive) suit. It came back without a button. Sigh... The next thing on the list is the laundry detergent they are now using to wash the linens and in-room robes. My husband and I put on the robes and agreed that they felt like sandpaper. No exaggeration - there was no way to wear them. The sheets were not as bad but still felt a bit scratchy. When I mentioned this to the woman at the registration desk she admitted that they had started using a different (I assume much cheaper) detergent. Last thing - the bed. The sofitel beds have always been luxuriously soft - like sleeping on a cloud. This mattress was soft beyond words - so soft that it perhaps needed to be replaced a year ago. Would I stay at the Sofitel again? It's a hard call - our experience may have just been bad luck. The hotel is perfectly located and really is very pretty.

On the floor below, same thing. So to go fot ice, go down 2 floors and hope that the machine on that floor does work. - Our $500 a night suite was extremely noisy, both during the day but especially at night.

It took moren than 1,5 hours and >4 calls to get someone to clean it. - Waterpressure is lousy, you will have to run around in your shower to even get wet. - The \"soaking tub\" is big enough for a kid but to small for an adult (6ft5\") Why not change to another room you might ask ?

They've tried to give the lobby a grand European touch, more or less successfully. And there is a bar/restaurant behind the reception. All in all, however, coming to the Sofitel feels like arriving at train station - that's how impersonal it is. Location is great - depending on what you want to do in NYC. It's only a blcok or 2 away from Bryant Park and easy access to everything.

My room was a Classic , a little more than $200 USD over Sat. and Sun. It's a very nice hotel. Clean, great location, the room was an excellent size and well supplied and maintained. Great bathrooms. I wouldn't dine at the hotel when there are so many better deals very close. The location is excellent in midtown, between 5th and 6th, with banking machines very close. I found the staff very helpful and courteous. I did have one complaint and that was that the bed was too soft. I don't know if you can request a harder bed or not. Comfort for me is a stone slab with about an inch of padding. But that's a personal preference, no fault of the hotel. The room was clean, in good condition, not any signs of wear and tear.

Our suite on the top floor (29th story) was indeed well-insulated against noise, had a great view, and we appreciated the fact that the windows have both sheer and black-out draperies. The large, full marble bathroom is nicely fitted out with deep tub, separate, walk-in shower, toiletries that are not heavily perfumed -- and an orchid in a vase and a candle. Large, flat screen TV's in both the living room & bedroom with a Bose clock radio in the BR. And the 2 little bottles of Evian left at evening turn-down were a nice touch, even though a bit of chocolate would be nicer :-) Willing to overlook the couple of smallish stains on the rug and the fact that the shower handle fell off and struck my foot; these things happen. But, the furnishings/layout -- apart from the bed -- were not that comfortable (some might find the bed too soft). Most surprising, the lone closet had a rod just 24\" wide and part of that was rendered unusable by the closet's caddies for ironing board and iron, leaving less than 18\" -- and thus relegating us to leaving our coats draped elsewhere and being able to hang only a few garments. There were shelves, but several of those were taken up by the folded bathrobes (no peg for those in the bathroom), a blanket but not the synthetic pillows promised by the in-room info booklet for those allergic to down & a wicker basket with the laundry bags tucked inside. The only drawer space were the 2 narrow ones in the bedside tables. Consequently, we had to leave most of our belongings packed in our luggage, which had to sit out as there was no place to stow our couple of standard carry-on pieces. From reading other reviews here that speak glowingly of the closet space, it appears that the rooms/suites are not configured alike; if you are not traveling solo, check out what's given you & ask if another room/suite is available if you too find yourselves facing hanging rod \"real estate\" costing ~$30/inch. The beds have no top sheet, but rather are covered with simply a luxurious down-filled duvet. Even if you're not squeamish about this -- and I'll assume they change the duvet cover between guests -- it can be uncomfortably warm. So, highly recommend that you ask housekeeping to make up the bed with a sheet & ordinary blanket before you retire. Lastly, utterly indifferent service all-around... not that I expect, or want, to be fawned over, but geez, it would be nice to feel that you're not part of the furniture.

Stay at the Sofitel NY and pay millions to call Argentina, spend another million on the mini bar, remortgage the house and get some room service, get angry at the maintenance man who cannot unblock a toilet in three seconds flat, and never forget that sometimes things just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to plan - especially when you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go direct and use so called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cheap deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd site to book your stay.

One time it took 1.5 hours to get a sandwich up, but at least they comped me. My two main complaints are: the towels and robes feel as scratchy as sandpaper and the lobby is blah. So, the towels. For a room that retails for over $2k a night (we got a better deal, but still), the towels were unbelievably scratchy, and shouldn't be. Worth noting, the bed was super comfortable and soft sheets, though the down comforter on top was very hot, and it was frustrating that there was no blanket on the bed as a lighter option. Second, the lobby. For a upscale NYC hotel, I would have hoped for more ambiance and action in the lobby, something more Ian Schraeger-esque. As another reviewer said, it's more like a very stylish pass-through. A missed opportunity on their part, I think.

(2) The gym is great, with plenty of machines, free weights and towels. Another good feature of the gym is that it is open 24/7 via the swipe access card used for your room. (3) The bed is awesome, and there is lots of warmth in the room with controllable heating / air conditioning. I did appreciate a window that opened as well, as sometimes the cleaning staff sprayed an awful 'air freshener' that made the room smell stale and off. (4) The front door men are very genuine and helpful - and extremely knowledgeable. Make sure you ask them for help or direction if you are unsure - and then remember that they deserve a tip at the end of your journey. (5) Power shower and big bath - always bonuses when you spend the day walking the streets. The little things: (1) The rooms are decent size and well appointed. The decor is great - although I still can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work out why we had a picture of the Eiffel Tower in our room! (2) Bath robes and extra towels are a nice touch.

The hotel is very close to everything, and we only walked for probably for 4-5 minutes to get to Times Square. We had a queen size bed, and the room was pretty good size. The bed was very comfy, but pillows too soft... One of the reasons I picked this hotel was the bathroom ! And it was a bit smaller than it looked in the pictures, but supernice and clean !! Both shower and bathtub (separate). Lots of space to place soaps and shampoos in the shower and also lots of space for toiletries by the sink and mirror. Very handy makeup-mirror as well. The aircondition was working very well, and not very noisy (something I have experienced in other american hotels...) We got a room on the 9th floor, and did not have any trouble with traffic or noise from the street. The staff was supernice and very helpful. The concierge helped us with booking our helicopter sightseeing, distances within the city, umbrellas in the rain and helped us weigh our bags before we left for the airport. We did not try the restaurant at the hotel, but it definately looked nice. If you want a cheaper breakfast (eggs, bacon, hash, pancakes etc) just go out of the hotel to the right (west on 44th, towards Broadway) and there is a restaurant called the Red Flame (i think..), like the diners you see in the movies :):), ...Red sign over the door, fast service, not very smiling staff but good food !

The marble bathroom was huge and the bed was very very comfortable. The room was spotless and was cleaned daily. Our bed was turned down every night and some chocolates and 2 bottles of water were left each night also. Our room had a view of the Chrysler Building so the view to wake up to was spectacular! Due to the rain that hit New York on Saturday 6th Sept the tennis final was re-arranged to Monday which was the day we were due to return home. Brook at the Concierge desk was fantastic and contacted Ticketmaster to sort out our tickets and also re-arranged our flights home (for a minimal cost which was great as they were meant to be non transferable). We were also not only allowed to keep our amazing suite but were offered a late check out on the Tuesday and the extra cost for the extra night was the same rate that we had paid for the original booking. The hotel has a great location and you can walk to pretty much anywhere in midtown.

I presented my Sofitel Privilege card, which should be enough to get the conversation started about the welcome cocktails and the late checkout.

Only a few cons - didn't love the toiletries, I've stayed at lesser hotels with higher quality products; there were no drawers to store non-hanging items; and finally, I had to replace my room key 3 times because my cell phone kept demagnetizing it. If you stay here - keep your cell phone and room key far apart! The location is great - if you're planning to spend a lot of time in midtown, or want the convenience of traveling to the upper east or west sides of town.

I looked it up on the internet and found a special deal for a Chic Picnic. Basically the fourth night was free, the room was superior and we received a picnic hamper with wine or champagne. The first down fall was the pricing. According to my reservation our final bill would show the full amount and then have a 25% discount. I therefore took the quoted amount to be the full amount and applied 25% discount. Not so we discovered on our first night. The quoted was with the discount so the cost was 33% higher than I budgeted. Maybe this is me being daft but I have reread my booking and it is still unclear. Eventually we got checked in and went to our room on the 19th floor. The view was breathtaking, the bed wonderfully soft, there was a plasma screen TV and a bottle of champagne for my birthday. However the \"big marble bath\" was barely big enough for me at 5'4\". We asked for our chic picnic on the second day and it came in a wonderful wooden hamper with a bottle of champagne. Unfortunately we were then told that we couldn't take the champagne to central park so that kind of ruined our \"champagne picnic\". We left the champagne in the room and, on the advice of the concierge, walked to Central Park carrying the hamper. Do not be tempted to do this. Take a taxi. It will cost all of $6 and you will arrive fresh and unharried. On our last evening we requested a wake up call as we had to be at the airport by 6.30.

The standard rooms are pretty small, but since we were only in the room to sleep, it wasn't a big issue. My only complaint would be the one small window in the room, which barely let in any light -- this was probably because we had a room in the back of the building, with a less-than-desirable view of the alleyway between other buildings. But again, since we were only in the room to sleep, it wasn't a major problem. Valet service is slow, but it does say to call for your car 30 minutes ahead of time on the claim ticket -- and I would definitely recommend calling the full 30 minutes ahead of time, especially if you know you'll be in a hurry (like if you're heading back to the airport). We had to rent a car for a day to drive into New Jersey, but the first few days in the city we didn't need a car at all -- the hotel is in such a great location that walking just about anywhere is the best way to go.

To me the concierge should probably be the most friendly and helpful person on the staff. My understanding of their job is to help hotel guests in any way they can. My two approaches to the concierge desk lasted a grand total of about 15 seconds as I was pretty much brushed aside by a man that I would describe as having, pardon my french, a stick up his backside.

Booked direct with the hotel, paying around US$600/night. In general, this hotel is pretty good, but there were just a couple of minor problems. Good stuff first: -The beds are very comfortable; good linens and towels. -Rooms are geniunely very quiet; I didn't hear any noise from the corridor or nighbouring rooms in my entire stay, which is rare for New York. -Good room size. -Food (room service and restaurant) was fine. -Concierge was great (they got us a table at Restaurant Daniel with only a few hours notice). Not so good: -I paid for a supposedly deluxe room on the 15th-29th floor with city view etc, but instead was allocated a random standard room on the 4th floor looking onto a wall. I know that hotels overbook etc, but they didn't apologise or offer to move me. When I requested an alternative room, nothing was available. Not a major upset, but slightly annoying. -Bellhop service isn't great. It took ages for anyone on front desk to call a porter to help with luggage when I was checking out. When they did eventually call for someone (using a xylophone ?), no one came. In the end I stopped a random hotel employee and they had to help carry my stuff. Other stuff: -A few reviews have raved about the bathrooms. They're fine, really, but nothing out of this world. The bathtubs, by the way, are fairly shallow, like many other American hotels. -The gym/fitness room is alright. Small like most hotels, and without a great choice of free weights, but at least clean and fairly well equipped. -Some of the other reviews have recommended visiting the \"Red Flame\" diner. Seriously, don't go - yes it's a diner, but it's one of the depressing sort. I went for a turkey burger and left most of it - overly greasy and processed, and just very unappetising. A much better option is the Comfort Diner, which is a few minutes away on East 45th Street and 3rd (or E 45th and Lexington, I can't remember). It looks like how you might expect a 50s-type diner to look, but isn't overly retro. Overall, a good choice for New York, not exactly what I'd call \"Luuxry Choice\", but I think for the money it's pretty good. I think for a real luxury choice, you'll have to spend a couple hundred more dollars.", "Date": "May 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool", "Title": "\u201cWhat A Place\u201d", "Author": "dgirl365", "ReviewID": "UR16460424", "Content": "We had read the reviews on here and decided to go for it for our very first stay in NYC.

The bottom line is that this is a great hotel and would stay there again. There was only one issue and it was a small one but you could hear the doors close of other rooms through the door of our room. Quite often it sounded like somebody coming into our room when actually it was somebody else closing or opening their door. Other than that: * it was very clean. Definitely a 4+ star equivalent in AU standards * staff were excellent, friendly and nice at all times * the location was brilliant. We spent 9 days in Manhattan and walked several kms everyday and saw many other hotels and we went back to the hotel every night happy we stayed here. The one thing that we were so glad about is the location. Its literally near everything including 5th Ave, Grand Central station, Times square, etc etc. We are only talking a couple of hundred meters away to these spots. The subway was interesting but safe however you could catch a cab from the hotel to Greenwhich Village for under $10 and to the financial district for not much more. Its also next door to the NY yacht club which some people may remember was the HQ for the America's cup. There are a couple of nice restaurants next door and there is also the diner a couple of doors up which we would sometimes get takeaway and crash in our room. We were upgraded to the 27th floor (there are 29 floors) and had a great view of the Chrysler Building 24/7. Lastly we weren't sure as to whether to get breakfast there or not and we were glad we didn't because the food in NY is unbelievable and there is so much within walking distance of the hotel.

We also tried Tavern on the Green for Sunday brunch, which we nearly cancelled because of the reviews on here but glad we did go. Service was excellent and food good.

We were in a junior suite. As you know from the other reviews, there are a lot of pros to this hotel: - hotel is new, modern, renovated (which can't be said of all NYC hotels, even the good ones) - large (for New York) rooms - service is good - great views from the upper floors of the building - great location esp for first-time tourists to NYC (which my family members were). Walking distance to Theater District, 5th Avenue shopping and Rockefeller Center, Empire State Building, pretty much everything from Central Park south through Midtown. - good nearby restaurants (including some in that same block) - a couple of other hotels just steps away, if you want a different ambiance. I'd particularly recommend the Algonquin for drinks in their old bar and the supper club performance. The biggest con to this hotel is price. It's not cheap -- we paid $950+/per night for the junior suite. Again that was in December, holiday season, so that's one of the most expensive times of the year. And those prices are in line with the other high-end hotels around the city at that time of the year. Other things that might be undesirable, depending on the individual traveler's preference: - this hotel does feel like a newer, modern style hotel. It doesn't have local charm; it's not atmospheric, old, or quirky. So for people who want local ambiance in their hotel, this isn't it. - it is in the big fat middle of the Midtown tourist and corporate zone.

I also had the continental breakfast one morning and that provided enough for lunch as well. My only complaints are that the ceiling of my bathroom was really icky - mouldy and stained. very unattractive. and i was charged for internet use on my first night when I could not have used it because my internet cables and plugs were in my bags somewhere in LA and my laptop battery was dead after the trip.

This was our first time to New York and the first time staying in a Sofitel and it was a really great experience. The hotel is in a fantastic location; just a very short walk away from the bright lights, shops and restaurants of Times Square. We also found Macy's and The Rock a very short walk away. 5th Avenue was a little bit more of a hike but we managed it without having to break out into too much of a sweat and sometimes treated ourselves to a very cheap taxi back to the hotel after a day of non-stop shopping! The hotel although right in the middle of everything, was down a very quiet street. We loved coming back to the hotel and being greated by the cheerful and welcoming staff at the front door. We went for one of the cheaper rooms (although still quite expensive). These rooms were only mean't to be on the very low floors of the hotel but we emailed the hotel ahead of our journey and asked if we could have our room as high up as possible for a nice view, and they definately delivered! The room itself was a lovely size with and the bed that was so comfortable we wanted to take home with us. There was also a really huge LCD TV in the room and I found it very difficult to get my partner away from the TV and out onto the streets of NY. The bathrooms were gorgeous as well and the whole room was extremely clean. We had room service on our first night at the hotel and really enjoyed the food - although because of the location of the hotel we found it very easy to venture out for a delicious dinner. All in all we thought the Sofitel was a great hotel and we loved how convenient it was to get to all the location attractions. When we go back to New York we will probably be staying at this hotel again.", "Date": "February 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anywhere USA", "Title": "\u201cAnother Good Stay at the Sofitel\u201d", "Author": "AnywhereUSA310", "ReviewID": "UR13580997", "Content": "I discovered the Sofitel a couple of years ago when I fled the Algonquin (which is down the street) after just one night. (Warning - the rooms at the Algonquin bear no relation to the pictures on the Algonquin's website). On this trip I was staying with relatives in New York when I was struck with the flu and decided to decamp to the Sofitel to recuperate. I will often book through Priceline, but with the flu I knew I was going to be confined to my room, so I did not want to take any chances on getting a bad hotel by bidding for an unknown property on Priceline. So I booked the Sofitel on Expedia. Here are the things I like about the Sofitel. Quiet - it is one of the quietest hotels I have stayed at anywhere. That is saying a lot for a city like New York. On both this stay and on my last stay, I felt like I was the only guest in the hotel and did not hear any street noise or any noise from the other rooms. Window Treatments - great window treatments - you can block out all the light at night. Room size - the rooms are very spacious for New York. (One of the reasons I checked out of the horrible Algonquin back when I first discovered the Sofitel a couple years ago is because of the shoebox size rooms there). Bathroom - as many have commented, the Sofitel has very nice bathrooms. There is a lot of counter space to spread out toiletries and every room has both a separate shower and tub (which is becoming very hard to find in New York since the trend is just to have a large shower - not good if you like a bath). Good lighting - there is more than adequate light to read and work. Some complain that the rooms are bland. It is true that unlike some of the \"hip\" boutique hotels, there is no cutting edge design. But I would rather have comfort over cutting edge design and I find the rooms with the simple white duvets and clean lines to have a Zen-like serenity. (Some complain that you just get a duvet, with no top sheet. But that is exactly how I sleep at home since I find top sheets annoying - so chacun \u00c3\u00a0 son go\u00c3\u00bbt). If you are looking for a hip, happening hotel, you probably won't like the Sofitel. I find it very sedate. That is a huge plus to me, but could be a minus to you. Anyway back to this stay. Wasn't sure how long I was going to be sick, so booked two nights through Expedia. Got put on the 14th floor (floors 2-14 are the \"cheap\" floors) right near the elevator. Didn't matter - it was still dead quiet and I felt like the only guest in the hotel. The room was fine - spacious and sunny with a nice little view (helpful when you are spending your time in bed sick looking out the window). One minor quibble with the room - the flat screen tv is on the desk. There is still room to work at the desk, but if you really wanted a desk where you could spread out, you might be unhappy (not an issue for me because I was too sick to work, but just noting it for business travelers. If you have a really work intensive trip - book a suite - see below). When I still had not recovered from the flu after two nights, I booked an additional three nights at the hotel. Expedia showed no availabiliy, but I was able to book directly (albeit at a higher price than through Expedia - I assume the hotel had higher occupancy on those nights and thus the rate was higher). Although there was nothing wrong with my original room, when I decided to stay an additional three nights, I asked if I could be upgraded. They offered to put me on a higher floor - the rooms are the same, you are just higher up. I asked if they had something bigger. They offered a corner suite for $100 more a night. I hesitated, but then agreed and I am glad I did - best $300 I have ever spent. The suite was really lovely - a big window in the bedroom with a view of the Chrysler building - absolutely beautiful at night. A very large sitting room with another big window, a comfy couch and chair, a large desk (no tv on it - unlike in the regular rooms), a very attractive entry way and a walk in closet. Same bathroom as the original room, except in the suites the tubs are bigger. Made me feel a whole lot better about being sick to be in such a nice environment. Room service - as you can imagine, being sick I made quite a bit of use of room service. Thankfully, unlike at some hotels, room service at the Sofitel operates 24 hours a day, although the after hours menu is quite limited. I find it amusing that people on this website complain about the price of room service at the Sofitel. It's like complaining about rain - it is just a fact of life that room service in a big city hotel is expensive. (And room service at the Sofitel is cheaper than at some other New York hotels such as the Grand Hyatt and the Royalton). Anyway, I didn't think the room service menu was very imaginative and the food was okay, but not great. Room service was prompt and everything was nicely plated. If you order tea, be sure to ask them to bring the hot water in a metal pourer rather than in the tea pot as the water will stay hot quite a bit longer even though the pourer is not as pretty as the tea pot. The Sofitel uses a good quality tea bag for their tea service. But It would have been much nicer to have loose leaf tea (which, alas, seems to be asking too much at 99.9% of hotels). (If you want loose leaf tea, however, you can get it next door to the Sofitel at the restaurant in the Iriquois Hotel). One final word - avoid using the Sofitel's dry cleaner. They ruined a favorite knit top I gave them by shrinking it so it no longer fit. The hotel refunded my money for the dry cleaning, but that was small consolation for a ruined favorite article of clothing. And items that I gave to launder while not irrevocably ruined came back faded and stiff. They really need to improve the laundry service - avoid it at all costs.", "Date": "February 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Suffolk", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location for a first visit to NY\u201d", "Author": "rover54", "ReviewID": "UR13578574", "Content": "We had never stayed in New York before and so have nothing to compare the Sofitel with, and it seems that all well placed hotels are eye-wateringly expensive.

Despite its central location, the street the hotel is located on is quite quiet. Our standard room was a good size, spotless, with a very comfortable bed and large bathroom. The restaurant is 'French' but the menu seems to be the same every night. However there are numerous options within a short walk, both 'upmarket' and more basic. Breakfast at the hotel is good, but most days we ate at the Red Flame, a basic diner about two minutes walk away. The food is half the price and you get a taste of more typical New York life. Some reviews mention building noise. There is building work going on nearby and some noise does reverberate up through the hotel, but this is only during the day, when you spend little time in your room. Even walking back to the hotel past midnight we felt very safe - safer than in the average UK city centre after midnight. In summary this is a superbly located hotel, especially for tourists. It is expensive, but so it seems are its competitors. The hotel is of good quality in every way, the only downside for us being a restaurant menu that didn't change.

My tip to pass on would be that when returning to the airport ask the doorman to get you a cab- he'll ask you whether you'd like a yellow cab or a Town car.

Upon arrival, we checked in promptly. Here's a tip that we had before we went, make sure you register for the Sofitel Privilege card (through their website) which has great perks, one of which meant we didn't have to check out until 4pm which is a big plus when you have an evening flight. Another tip is to email the hotel prior to your arrival with a \"special request for a higher floor\". Obviously this is not a dead cert but it seemed to work for us as we were given a room on the 27th floor with an fab view of the Chrysler Building (I think it helped because it was my birthday on 28th December PLUS we had a bottle of sparkling wine in our room upon arrival - a wonderful touch/attention to detail). The room itself was spacious, clean and, well, what can I say about the beds - bliss!

There's a great big flat screen TV in the room which is in keeping with the modern atmosphere/decor. All in all, we were very pleased with our room. We found the internet use in the hotel lobby handy, although it the computers were almost always in use, but hey, who wants to be reminded of home when you're on holiday?!

The Sofitel was recommended to me by a trusted and well-traveled friend as being conveniently located and comfortably elegant. It was both. The room was really quiet and we found the duvet-covered bed to be perfectly comfortable and cozy. The room was clean, well-kept, nicely organized and tastefully appointed but I wouldn't say it was luxurious---very nice but not luxurious. We arrived to champagne, a personalized birthday cake that was delicious, and a lovely cheese and fruit plate sent by family. I had requested a room with a nice view and we were put in room 2221 facing the Chrysler Building. It was a nice enough view but nothing to write home about. I was a little disappointed to see on the fire evacuation map on the door that our room, though we had booked a deluxe king for a special occasion, appeared to be a smaller version\u00e2\u20ac\u201dat least on that floor. Based on the floor plan it appeared that the \u00e2\u20ac\u015321\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on each floor may be smaller versions of the other comparable rooms if the floor plan is the same---worth checking out when you request your room. Room service offerings were nice enough but at the price, it was well worth the effort to venture out. The bar was nice but the staff seemed very disengaged/indifferent---not a smile to be had. A little warmth makes all the difference. In general the hotel staff was perfectly polite but I wouldn't say they were overly warm. The housekeeping staff did a great job as far as I could tell. The various concierges were always happy to assist but I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really say that any of their recommendations hit the mark.

There were several other items that really weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that big of a deal to us but others may feel differently so I thought I would mention them. When we arrived the first evening, it quickly became apparent that the AC was not working. We called engineering and were told that the AC was out due to boiler problems. They said to turn off the air while they were working on it but then they never notified us when the repair was complete and we fell asleep in a hot room on top of the covers. One evening my husband made a run to the ice machine and found it not working. He went to several other floors before finding one that was operating. And lastly, the hotel provides a nice soap, shampoo, conditioner and hair rinse but no bath salts or anything to add to your bath so be sure to bring your own in the event you would like to soak in the tub. All in all, the things I mention as negatives were rather minor in our eyes but had they been tended to, our stay would have been even better.

We were eventually given a room and went on up. The carpets were stained, there were crumbs on the bedside table, the window looked out on to a brick wall......this is a preferred room????? I called down and complained and they miraculously found us a room on the 22nd floor, it did seem smaller and more cramped and as it turned out it was. They moved us again the next day to a more comfortable room. What was so bad? The over all housekeeping i found to be poor, the general areas were not well cleaned, dust everywhere, dirty water in the flower pots etc.. the bedroom was very poorly serviced, i noticed before leaving for the day that there was an item on the floor in the bathroom as well as a piece of paper by the bed on the floor (scrap). The room was cleaned and neither item were even moved, quite how they managed to clean the bathroom and make the bed without even disturbing these items i have no idea! We waited 2 hours and had to make 4 calls to get extra pillows. The bell boy told us to call downstairs to get some complimentary drinking water as none was in the room. Next thing, room service arrive with a bottle of water and a $15 check........i sent them away. Next thing someone lets themselve into the room without checking anyone was there and proceeded to check the mini bar, they left 2 complimentary bottles of water on the floor in the hallway. On one of the mornings we decided to go out and grab some breakfast and then come back to the room and prepare for the day ahead thus i put the do not disturb sign on the door as we left. I can only assume housekeeping noticed this as by the time we returned they had made up the room, this was exactly what i wanted to avoid. I confronted the housekeeper and her response was there was no sign on the door as if there was she couldn't go in, she claimed it was in the room on the floor. I am 100% certain this was not the case. The worst thing about all this was that after several complaints from a guest you would think management would talk to you about it and try to rectify things, not a word.

The Bell staff and Concierge were immediately on the scene, got us straght into another town car, apologised, and said that would be refunding the cost of the car.

Morton's Steak house for casual dining in the bar (with light bites for Brits/Europeans who aren't used to such large portions) 3. Good light lunches/snacks when shopping in Bloomingdales (ground Floor) 4. Carmines Italian restaurants for the atmosphere, but not for the food. 5.

As mentioned earlier, the higher you are in this hotel, the better. The staff here is very friendly and goes out of their way to make you happy. This statement does not apply to the inept servers at the hotel bar however. Go elsewhere for libations. Regarding the glowing writeups of the 'Red Flame Diner', I just don't get it. The place is o.k. for breakfast and they are certainly fast with delivery, but it is nothing special. A more interesting choice for breakfast and fast is 'Dishes'. Great quality food, even if the atmosphere is 'cafeteria-ish'; two blocks away. Ask the concierge. We ate at DB bistro (two doors down from hotel) and were sorely disappointed, especially after having eaten at the flagship Daniel two nights before. Of course it is much cheaper, but you can do much better for the money. For those from out of town, NYC water is terrific. It comes from upstate New York and does not have to be treated. Drink it from the taps, you are wasting money otherwise. Yes, it was expensive at $500 a night with tax, but my friends stayed at the Roosevelt for $300 and hated it. This hotel is so worth it.

If you want unobscured views, book the penthouse suites. otherwise live with it i say. Would definately reccommend this hotel, and indeed the sofitel chain.

We were served freshly squeezed orange or grapefruit juice, coffee/tea and a choice of entree. The food was freshly prepared and always hot. My kids enjoyed the french toast and the nutella pancakes.

I asked for a room on a higher floor further from the elevator. Danielle at the front desk then found us a room on the 16th floor. She walked us to the room and it had a horrible view and was a corner room. The corner rooms seem much smaller due to the awkward angle. She said she'd check for higher rooms and in two minutes called us to meet her on the 21st floor. This room 2114 was perfect...a good view, far from the elevator, good size, and high enough away from any street noise. Thanks Danielle! The Room-- The room was spotless just like in the pictures. The Bathroom-- The bathroom was perfect. I picked this hotel over the comparable Times Square hotels because I am a bathroom snob. I need the extra sq feet, vanity space, stand up shower, newer fixtures and mirrors, CLEAN bathtub, and divider between toilet and sink. There was no mold anywhere! The fresh orchid was a nice touch. The Bed -- The bed was very soft. I usually like a firm bed, but we both slept great. Location -- If you're visiting the US Open in Flushing Meadows this is a great location. We had an 7-8 minute walk to Grand Central Station to catch the number 7 train for a 30 minute ride to the Shea Stadium stop. The 7 express ride back is a little faster at 21 minutes.

Breakfast -- We ate a relaxing breakfast every morning at the Gaby restaurant with complimentary newspapers. Buy the extra breakfast charge when you book the hotel. The french press coffee and juice, croissants, Steak and Egg, Nutella pancakes, or Egg White Omelet entrees were very good and worth the up front charge. The service was excellent. The regular prices ranged from $19 -$26 (Steak, Egg, and Potatoes). Internet -- We used the 3 computer stations in the lobby every day to print the match schedules and print our boarding passes when we had to leave. We also used the wireless connection in the room to do a little work $10/24 hours. Check out -- The check out was fine. My husband moved some of the drinks in the mini-bar to make room for our drinks from Duane Reade (one block away on 5th avenue). Due to the sensors 6 drinks came up on our bill but that was quickly cleared. What can the Sofitel work on? Upgrade the towels to a more luxurious softer brand, make the switch to flat screen tvs, add more padding to the carpet. This is a great pick for those looking for a place to relax and refresh after a busy day in the city who need a spotless large bathroom like me!", "Date": "September 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "san diego", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!!!!\u201d", "Author": "jennychan823", "ReviewID": "UR8603676", "Content": "I never write reviews but I had to after I stayed at the sofitel.

We took the risk of purchasing a special deal on Expedia in which the room was to be selected at check-in. Still it was more money than we have ever paid for a hotel stay. We did request a non-smoking, deluxe room on highest possible floor. Not for one moment did we regret this selection. We were given a queen-deluxe, non-smoking room on the 23rd floor (out of 29). We looked out our window at the Empire State Building. The room was spotless and well-kept during our stay. The hotel staff was helpful and courteous without being in our face. The location of this hotel is great. On this block, 44th Street is quiet but not secluded. At the same time in 5 minutes you can be in the middle of Times Square. We couldn't have asked for more. If you are more frugal on your spending, you will find a satisfying breakfast or lunch nearby at Cafe Metro or Cafe Europa.

I've tried to stay there several times because it has often ranked Number 1 at TripAdvisor. It was always booked when I tried, and I was therefore thrilled that I was finally getting to stay there. However, now that I have, I wonder why hotel guests rank it as highly as they do. I travel all over the world, stay in 4 and 5 star properties wherever I go, including Sofitels in London and Rome. The Sofitel New York does not live up at all to the standards at these hotels. Let's talk about the service -- or shall I say, the lack of customer service. When my husband and I walked in, I walked over to the front desk, and greeted the guest service agent with a big smile, and said: \"Hello, how are you today?\" The man didn't lift his eyes to even look at me, and said. \"I'm fine, thank you.\" Never bothered to ask me how I was -- or indeed greet me at all. I had negotiated a rate that included breakfast, but the agent said there was nothing on my file about that. He made no attempt to look into it, and relied entirely on me to find the documentation to prove it. That took some time to resolve, but finally it was and we received the breakfast coupons. The room itself was not at all impressive. We were two people staying in a king room. Most people travelling alone do not need a king bed, so one would think that king rooms would have sufficient drawers and hanging space to allow two people to unpack their suitcases. Not so in this room. The hanging portion of the closest was about a foot wide, with an iron and ironing board crammed in there as well. I had to remove them to make room the clothing we had brought for our 3-day stay, which included evening attire, day clothes, and business suits. The bed had only a comforter, with no single sheet between the duvet and the fitted sheet. That meant that, if we found the comforter too warm, which we did, we had nothing to cover ourselves with. The view we had outside our window was obstructed by buildings, making the room very dark. The floor lamps did not have bright enough bulbs to give ample light for reading. The Panasonic TV was an old model, not one of the flat-screen kinds I've seen in most hotel rooms I've stayed in elsewhere recently. There was only one bathrobe in this king room, which disappeared on two day, never to be seen again. The doors to the bathroom open outward into the closet area, requiring guests to remember to close one set before opening another. Not a well-thought out design. The best part of our stay there were two Albanian servers in the hotel restaurant. They brought a friendliness and eagerness to the hotel that was lacking in all the front desk agents. All in all, this was a disappointing stay.

They made the beds and then if you weren't in the room in the afternoon / early evening then they would come and turn the bed down. The location of the hotel is perfect. It's about 45th st, it's around 200 yards off 5th avenue. It a 10-15 min walk to central park or the same amount of time going south towards empire state etc. Would highly recommend this hotel and the helicopter ride, Top of the Rock (better than the empire state) and Central Park horse & carriage ride.

Housekeeping first class, with exceptional attention to detail and cleanliness. Breakfasts sumptuous (but make sure you know the deal you are staying on: some deals include breakfast, in which case you are given a voucher to present in the restaurant - this can lead to a muddle if you are a family of four like us two of whom had vouchers and two who did not - this is one area the hotel could do with clarifying for their own waiters' benefit as much as guests').

Everyone seems thoroughly trained and the atmosphere is of calm professionalism. Concierge and his team excellent. Most remarkable of all: in your room, high above the horn-honking mayhem of Manhattan, you will hear....nothing. Not the merest whisper of a police siren disturbs your peace. You could be in the middle of the countryside. This is not the cheapest Manhattan hotel but solid value for money, and with the pound going so far in the USA it is even better value.

Walked down 6th Avenue so that we could get a feel for the different areas such as Greenwich, Chinatown, and Soho which I have never had much chance to visit. With regard to the hotel, I don't have much to add that hasn't already been said. The hotel is fine for the most part. Great beds--no yucky bedspread only crisp white sheets and comforter/duvet. The bathroom was clean and nice and the bath products were very good as well. The carpeting was a little stained looking and the room was a little small, but no smaller than most hotel rooms in New York. Didn't eat at the hotel as it seemed rather pricey and I prefer to experience independent establishments. The concierge was very good at providing recommendations and for the most part we enjoyed the recs. Make sure to get the free Sofitel privilege card as it entitles you to free drinks when you arrive. My one complaint was that the hotel was unwilling to adjust my room rate despite the fact that the website was now showing a better rate. I booked about 2 months prior to my trip and got a room rate for about $303 which did not include breakfast and could be cancelled up to 24 hours prior to arrival. The week before my trip I noticed that the Sofitel website indicated a $274 room rate (for the same room that I had booked at $303) or a $309 room rate which included breakfast. I printed out the sheet and when we arrived I assumed that the hotel would be willing to honor the $309 rate and include breakfast. I realize now that I should have cancelled the reservation (since there was no penalty) and then rebooked at the $309 rate as it was only $6 more but would be well worth the increase as both my spouse and I would get breakfast each morning. I assumed that the hotel would be willing to make this change and honor the rate but was fed some line about it being an \"internet only rate\". It amazes me how customer service is valued differently at various organizations. I really expected more given that I am a Sofitel Privilege member. Anyway, I didn't make a big fuss about it, but will probably be less likely to book a room at the Sofitel for my next New York trip. I might consider the Iroquois which is right next door as I have heard good things about it. Restaurant to consider--Del Friscos -nice steak house with a reasonably priced 3 course meal served prior to 6:30 PM and within walking distance from the hotel in view of Radio City Music Hall.", "Date": "June 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Laurel, MS", "Title": "\u201cWonderful!\u201d", "Author": "PickyHotelGuest", "ReviewID": "UR7868270", "Content": "Thanks to those who recommended this place!

Beside the hotel is a wonderful Greek restaurant called Kellari (not anywhere like the rubbish you find on Greek Package Holiday) and along the same street is a very good but reasonably priced Italian Restaurant called Osteria al Doge. Breakfast was not included in the room rate so we ate out. There is a diner called the Red Flame which was okay and always busy but try the Brooklyn Diner on 43rd Street. Breakfast may be twice the price but the food was beautiful and decor was very appealing too!On our first night we ate in the hotel's restaurant called Gaby. The food was very good but New York has some excellent restaurants so do try to get about. This was a perfect trip but if the hotel isn't up to scratch then the rest of the holiday is downhill.

The Sofitel did live up to all the great things that we read about it on TripAdvisor. Our great experience started when making our reservations directly with the hotel. Their web site promised to beat anybody's price -- and they did. We booked 3 nights, but only stayed 2. More on this later. Thur. night was a bit pricey at $389. However, Fri was $299, and the rate for Sat. was $251 -- for a 4-star hotel. This was the price for their basic room on a lower floor. But I told the reservation clerk that I would like a higher floor, which she booked for me at no additional charge. What a way to make a positive 1st impression. Besides that, the clerk was extremely courteous. Our cab driver drove us down Broadway to arrive at the hotel. My wife and I were quite pleased that the hotel was just 3 blocks away from all the glitz and glamor of Times Sq. Also the hotel was on the corner of 5th Ave, the door to some of the most luxurious shopping in the world. And we were just a short cab ride from Central Pk. However, we could have walked to it. It's only about a mile away. Back to our room, it was on the 23rd floor facing the Chrysler Build, which was a good reference point if you get turned around. We had a king bed with the most comfortable bedding. The room size was adequate for us but not huge. But the marble bath was huge with a great makeup light which my wife loved. And it had a standalong shower large enough for 2 (smile). Much, much more, but don't want to be too long. Food: we did not eat a single meal at the hotel. The concierge at our request directed us out the back door to the Manhattan Cafe, with an excellent buffet costing less than $20 for 2. A couple of doors down is a dollar store to pick up film, sun block, etc. And out the front down a couple of blocks toward Times Sq is Virgil's BBQ. Chicken, ribs, and pulled pork and sides were quite good (for NY -- we're from TX), costing about $20/person. For sightseeing, recommend that you take the hop on-hop off tour bus which goes to all 5 boroughs. Starts on 7th Avenue, 4 blocks from the Sofitel. Re: shows, altho we paid regular price -- we were fortunate to get orchestra seats for Phantom and Color Purple for about $225 a pair. But, 1/2 price tix are available at the Marriot Hotel near Broadway, about 1/2 mile from the Sofitel. But be prepared to stand in a very long line. One final thing: re being in Midtown. Several reviews commented about the noise. It was not a factor for us. Had no problem sleeping. Final-final point (sorry) -- as mentioned earlier we reserved 3 nights, but decided that we would stay up all night on Sat. So we saved over $300. I checked with the concierge 1st. They locked up our bags for free. They said we could leave them as long as we liked. What a customer-friendly gesture! In closing, the personnel, facilities, and location of the Sofitel Hotel made our 20th anniversary weekend a Godtastic event.

This hotel is absolutely fantastic, one of the best I've stayed in. It is very well located, just two blocks from Times Square in one direction and Grand Central Station in the other. We booked via the Hotel website several months in advance and got a great deal on a King Suite. I also asked to be up high and we got the 25th floor which was really nice, though it was on the same level as the ledge for the window cleaning equipment which did slightly detract, but I'm not too fussed as the views of the Rockefeller center were very nice. The suites are very pleasant, lovely lounge area, two televisions (one in the lounge, one in the bedroom), the beds and pillows are fantastic. The bathroom is great as well. The staff always treated us very well, with courtesy and professionalism. We never ate at the restaurant but did get Room service, do read the fine print on the room service menu which states all the extras that are added onto the price (tips & taxes are all added on, yet there is a section on the receipt you sign for extra tips, but I can't see this is necessary as it is basically double tipping). I found no pressure to tip anyone, they even asked on arrival if we needed help with our bags & we said no so were able to take them up ourselves, we had heard that at other places they can insist on taking your bags so that you have to tip. Also I let them know it was my Birthday and they very kindly gave me a bottle of very nice sparkling wine beautifully presented in a classy ice bucket with some glasses. The maid service was excellent, we left them a tip each day which they took & would leave a note of thanks. We were never disturbed while our \"do not disturb\" sign was out. The only quibbles I have, and this is because I am pedantic, are: 1. The lifts can be a bit slow sometimes, and the timing seems to be out, our floor for instance was almost always serviced by the same lift, which could take quite a while to turn up, making me wonder what the others were doing 2. The In-room TV system is very comprehensive, and does have a good billing system to let you know what you've spent, but it can be very slow to load, occasionally will crash and freeze up (even turning off & on the TV doesn't work). Also sometimes it can appear in black&white or have distorted sound. However the movie we purchased through the system played flawlessly which was good 3. The Ice Machine on our level was broken which required us to go to the next level, a minor inconvenience but worth noting. 4. The Iron in the room sparked in the plug socket & tripped the breaker for the entire room one morning. They were quite quick in resetting the breaker and gave us a brand new iron straight away, but it was slightly disconcerting none-the-less.

The TV was a bit old, not a great deal in the way of storage space but the room was the best I have seen yet even compared to the Fairmont in Toronto. Kudos to whoever makes those beds as they were the best nights sleep I have ever had. The bathroom was to die for and in a moment of nosiness I eventually figured out the knob in the bathroom was great for knowing what the other half was was watching on TV. The location was amazing with Central Park, Empire State, 5th & 6th, Broadway and Times Square all within walking distance although if you do walk to Central Park I'd advise stopping for coffee half way as it is quite far. We received complimentary turn down and 2 bottles of Evian every evening plus the weather forcast for the following day but no chocolates - probably just as well. New York itself wasn't a total let down but I think the weather was very kind to us which helped. Guys, if you're thinking about getting a nice piece of jewellery for your other half (especially the diamond ring variety) definately visit Tiffany on 5th near Central Park. 3 glasses of champagne later and I had the most beautiful engagement ring that would have cost double in the UK. Other things to do/visit - Red Flame (breakfast, lunch, dinner or midnight snack, this place was always welcoming and the selection and prices were great plus it wasn't all tourists there), Apple store on 5th, Grand Central Station (5 minute walk from the hotel). I, like others, found that the hotel staff thought we were made of money when it came to recommending restaurants. I don't think jeans & trainers helped our cause for door opening but when walking that much, I wasn't doing heels! One negative factor about the trip was the red NY sight-seeing buses. They were over priced, over crowded and at times you could have walked faster. Great for learning more about NY but a travellers guide would be cheaper and warmer. A crowd of 50+ (including us) were stranded for over an hour at Battery Park waiting to get home on a day when winter woolies were required but not worn.

Part of the vacation was assisted by the fact that this was the best whether that New York is apparently had in the last three months.

We have the best bathroom that I have ever seen in New York City at this hotel. We also had a convenient lunch while we were waiting for our room because we arrived a little bit early. They were very helpful and moved us up a couple of floors and also gave us a much better view so that directly out of our window was the Empire State building. However, we went on three tours while we were in New York City and let me tell you that everyone there on each of these tours feels that you really need to look at the Empire State building so I have pretty much seen it in every view the you can possibly see and likely have at least 50 to 60 pictures just because of the number of times that was mentioned and I much like a lemming feel the need to take a picture each and every time.

Oddly when I stay at hotels in the $50-$75 range they always include free Internet. I would recommend joining the membership club as well because of the expense of the hotel I have quite a substantial amount of points now with the membership club and will recommend everyone to join because it does enable you to have a late checkout and also provides you with two free drinks.

They complied with my request for a quiet room by placing me at the end of the hall. Room #1918 had a northerly view over 45th St towards the GE bldg; big plus total blackout curtains keeping out light. The hotel quickly provided the requested additional bathrobes and luggage racks.

What a treat! The concierge even provided us with an umbrella for our rainy day. We thought the staff from the doormen, concierge, front desk, house-keeping to restaurant servers were friendly, efficient and helpful. We found the beds, firm but nestled the body with the feather bed topped mattresses, firm feather pillows, silky soft covered feather duvets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the linens were of the highest quality. There were plenty of plush towels, hand towels, wash cloths and great ablutions in the bathroom: lotion, shampoo, lots of conditioner for us girls, body wash, amenity box (swabs, cotton balls, sewing kit), votive candle plus a lovely orchid in silver vase. There is a separate shower & bath (shower is fine, but the Westin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s double shower head has the Sofitel beat). Another nice touch is a clock/alarm with CD player so I could play music \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I had compiled a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd type CD.

We like a cool room and the heat was on in the hotel, but try getting A/C room in Europe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c BIG kudos to the NY Sofitel! I could only find fault with a few things: one red carpet stain outside our bathroom & another stain in the corner near the closet, silicone caulking around the sink had oozed out between the counter and under-sided mounted sink basin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not pretty. Also I would have preferred each bed to have its own reading light rather than one shared between the beds. Did have a relaxing dessert in Gaby, their cozy bistro/bar with coffee late one evening. Coffee was strong & expensive, $6, but I did receive a whole carafe (I only wanted one cup, oh well). The dessert was lovely: raspberry tart topped with a light as air meringue accompanied by raspberry sorbet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just delicious. Overall the Sofitel hits the target on the most important points: Comfy, firm beds, high quality linens & ablutions, QUIET, environmental controls.

If you have booked to stay at the Sofitel New York you will not go away disappointed. New York may not be what you are expecting but the hotel will be! Found New York to be so so. It is not a city we could fall in love with such as Paris but it is okay and enjoyed the stay. Well worth a visit but not much in the way of romantic essence especially not at The Empire State Building as I thought there would be here if no where! The Empire State Building is okay, it is a construction site inside and not only do you queue to get up but you queue to get down too and Top of The Rock at Rockerfeller Centre is far better, much closer to the essence of New York I was expecting and more professionally managed. As other reviewers have said if you are due to stay at the Sofitel anywhere in the world it is well worth getting yourself a Sofitel Privilege Card in advance - takes about 3 weeks to arrive but if you apply online there are no fees and you can ring France obtain your card number and expiry as I did and quote upon arrival or booking in order to gain you can get your free drinks on arrival and 4pm check out without hassle. You need to ring France to get your details if they don't arrive in time number on their website. Didn't spend much as food was relatively inexpensive best meal and most expensive meal we had was at Grand Central Station in the restaurant opposite Jordon Steak House, can't remember the name something like Caprianio.

Very nice art and lighting. One neat feature was the speaker in the bathroom that lets you hear what your partner is watching on TV, or turn it off for peaceful bathing.

I had the feeling they'd be very nice about letting one practice one's French too. Not Parisians evidently.

Moreover, I was immediately provided with bigger size slippers when I complained that ones already obtained were small for me. And usually, I got my room cleaned already in the morning coming back from breakfast. Breakfast is served at Gaby restaurant as well as lunch and dinner. American breakfast for $20 is great! It traditionally includes eggs, sausages/ham/bacon, pan-fried potato, tomatoes, freshly squeezed orange juice, coffee, croissant, and jam. Besides, fresh berries plate with soar cream is also highly recommended. The restaurant and bar designed like a French caf\u00c3\u00a9-bistro and stylishly decorated with old French movies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 snapshots with famous actors - Jean Gabin, Gerard Philippe, Jean Marais, et al. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice place to have a dinner too. The French cuisine is very good. The personnel are extremely pleasant and well skilled. But most of all, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pleased by the concierge service. Daniel and Vlad, thank you guys for your great job! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to especially appreciate Vlad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal assistance to find out my disappeared prepaid tickets to Metropolitan Opera which hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been delivered by a local ticket agency on time neither to my place in Moscow nor to Sofitel in New York City. Many thanks again, Vlad! All in all, I really liked this hotel very much. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a wonderful place for staying there. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not cheap at all, but worths every buck spent! And location! Just in the heart of Manhattan! Take a few steps on your left \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the 5th Avenue; a few steps on your right \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ever shining Times Square, 42nd Street subway station and Broadway theatres; fifteen minutes slow walk straight ahead downtown \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shopping kingdom.

The weather was absolutely freezing but the hotel was wonderful and exactly as described in previous reviews. Having walked every inch of Manhattan, including the Brooklyn Bridge (a must at dusk to see the lights come on in Manhattan), it was a joy to get back and relax in our gorgeous bed! We signed up for a privilege card and were upgraded to a room on the 21st floor with an amazing view of the Chrysler Building and were given vouchers for two free drinks in the bar and late checkout. Can highly recommend doing this. We took breakfast either in our room or in the Gaby Restaurant and the little extras and attention to detail made it well worth the money. Our son works in SoHo and took us to many trendy cafes and restaurants in Greenwich, SoHo, Alphabet City and East Side, which we would have missed on our own. They may look scruffy on the outside but are packed with locals and ooze atmosphere, especially for the younger visitor. I can't remember all the names but we lunched at Chat 'n Chew at 10 East 16th St and had dinner one night at Esperanto Restaurant in Alphabet City, as well as quaint French and Italian restaurants. Be sure to also visit Cafe Lalo at 201 W 83rd St on the Corner of Amsterdam Avenue where 'You Got Mail' was filmed. Our first day we took a 'New York Party Shuttle Bus' tour which I can heartily recommend. The small bus with guide takes you all around Manhattan including the Statten Island Ferry and Ground Zero and the guide gives a personal insight into the whole of Manhattan. Check out their website. On returning to the airport the doormen arranged for us to travel in the black limousine shared with a neighbouring hotel, costing 65 dollars including tolls, and worth the extra for the comfort. From the hotel we could walk to Grand Central, Empire State Building, Rockerfeller Centre (the views from the top are as good if not better than the Empire State, and the queues are a lot less - again dusk is a popular time to see the city in daylight and as the lights come on), Chrysler Building, Times Square, Maceys, etc, making it the perfect location. I'm glad we didn't stay in Times Square as this gets very busy and noisy but a cut price show can be booked at the TKTS booth now by Drowsy Chaperone (didn't see this show but it was recommended to us).

I think it's important to clarify that -- it's a FOUR STAR hotel. It's totally not the Four Seasons or anything else that is five star, so I don't understand why people go there expecting it to be at that level. However, if you accept that it's a four star hotel, you'll probably find it's the BEST four star hotel in Manhattan. Stayed there for a week during late March this year, and had an absolutely lovely time. Absolutely no dramas during our stay, and we found everything to be clean, efficient, well managed and friendly. I booked a King Suite via their website on the '3 night getaway' rate, which was tremendously good value. The 7 full nights in this massive 650 square foot suite was just 2942 USD, which is remarkable value for a room this size in New York in my opinion. The suite itself was absolutely lovely. Plenty of room to relax in, which is vitally important if you are in New York for a blazing 7 day tourism extravaganza, and you come home heavily laden with shopping bags every day :) Rooms in NY tend to be a bit smaller than other cities around the world, so this wasn't the largest suite I'd ever been in, but it was an okay size. Of particular note is the bathroom, which had the most wonderful deep soaking bath tub that we made good use of almost every day. Concierge was excellent -- we wandered down to Daniel and said we needed a nice restaurant to have dinner in on Saturday night before our Broadway show, and he very quickly got us into an award winning restaurant nearby. His efficiency and professionalism was quite amazing. Reception was also fantastic, but it depended on who you spoke to. Brook / Brooke was absolutely sensational. She had so much enthusiasm and was so incredibly friendly, that we couldn't help but have a huge smile on our faces as we checked in. Every time I needed to come down to reception, if I saw Brook I would make a bee line for her because she was so lovely. The bed -- oh my goodness. Yes, people rave about the Sofitel bed and I was always like \"sure, whatever\", but then I got in this one and I totally understand what everyone is on about! They put this very VERY soft featherbed thingy on top of the mattress, and it turns the bed into an absolute slice of heaven. We were often thinking about it while we were out and about :) Great down pillows too. Room service was good, although they did make a mistake once, but quickly rectified it without any hassle. The food was very nice. The downstairs restaurant has been badly slated in past reviews, but we ate dinner there on our first night and found it to be very nice, although the service was a touch slow. We cannot comment on the breakfast because we never ate it there. For breakfast, as has been mentioned in previous reviews, head down the street to the Red Flame Restaurant. This is a kind of 'diner' with lovely big breakfasts, fast service, and a real cool New York street ambience. People come in and queue up at the take-out counter for bagels and coffee, while we sat in one of the numerous booths and just soaked it all up. The waitresses may not be Minnesota nice, but they are super fast and efficient, and ice cold water will be on your table just as you sit, with coffee not far behind it. We had breakfast there every morning, trying different specials and can recommend a stack of things! (great poached eggs, home fries, omelettes) Okay, back to the hotel! Niggles: the cupboard for hanging your clothes in was very small, especially for a suite. However, we managed to get by. We didn't get a fabulous view, even though we were on the top floor. The view was of some unrecognisable buildings, so if you want a view of Chrysler (which you can absolutely get from this hotel) please make sure you request precisely that well in advance. The water pressure in the shower was perhaps below average. On the whole, we had a wonderful stay here and I cannot give this hotel anything less than full marks. I would have paid two to three times the price at the Four Seasons, and I'm sure the experience would not have been that much more comfortable to warrant it. They have great staff at the Sofitel, it's in a fabulously convenient location, and our time there was hassle free and completely pampered. What more can you ask for?

If anyone was considering getting into the hotel industry they would be wise to go and stay at Sofitel for a week to get an understanding of how a hotel should be run. The rooms were stylishly furnished, immaculately clean, the bed comfortable with basically no street noise. The location was proximate to everything New York has to offer.

Everything was very clean. The first night during turn-down service a vase of fresh orchids was placed on the vanity. Two bottles of complimentary water were also left each night. The employees were all very friendly, but not conspicuous. There was a wonderful doorman who gave us advice on nice places to visit and good restaurants. He also gave us a large umbrella when it was raining. We didn't eat at the restaurant, because we wanted to eat at several local restaurants and just never got around to the one in the hotel. The location is great. It is next door to the New York Yacht Club, which has a beautiful exterior. We could walk to Grand Central Terminal and Times Square. My only complaint is that there was no top sheet on the bed. It had a crisp, clean white-on-white striped bottom sheet, with a matching duvet cover on a down comforter. I got a little warm during the night and would liked to have been able to use just a top sheet. The duvet cover was very clean, and it appeared to be replaced each day. Also, our room didn't have much of a view, since we were on the 4th floor. Our window overlooked 43rd street, where we could see another building next door.

Although a bit more expensive than some hotels I would have no hesitation in recommending the Sofitel to anyone wishing to stay in New York. There is a diner a minute away called the Red Flame, (turn right out of the hotel), this is a fantastic place for a reasonably priced breakfast. Please try the Sofitel you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "April 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Little Rock, AR", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Lee4", "ReviewID": "UR7253460", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Sofitel NYC for 3 nights and really enjoyed our stay.

The bathroom was large with a shower and separate tub. The space around the sink was plentiful, with an extra shelf to store things on. The room also had a small closet, hair dryer, iron, ironing board, safe, robe, and slippers. The room was clean and we would happily stay there again. The hotel's location is excellent and it was easy to walk to many places in the mid-town area and to Times Square/Broadway. We saw Spamalot, which was on the same street, just 3 blocks or so away.

They have thought of every detail, including chocolates when they turn down the bed to a weather forecast placed on the bedside locker every night. The bar serves a wide range of beers and always provides olives and cheese bites with your drinks. The location is just off fifth avenue and minutes from SAKS and Times Square is only two blocks away. We could see the lights from our bedroom window. To conclude, this place definately deserves its high ratings on trip advisor. It is a bit costly at $3700 for a week but if you are looking for something a bit special, then it is worth it.

I checked on-line at the Sofitel website and booked us an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Internet Special\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rate of $269/night. Rates at many other 4-star + hotels were $400 - $600, so things were looking pretty good. The purpose of the trip was to spend some quality time together and have some fun, so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to start our weekend with a dirty, stinky cab ride to the hotel. I \u00e2\u20ac\u0153googled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd airport transfer services and settled on Jet Black Limousine Service, based on the quality of their website, www.jetblackonline.net , their pricing and their fleet of Mercedes and BMW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Tony met us in baggage claim and drove us from LGA to the Sofitel in a beautiful sparkling Mercedes S Class, black & black car. Bottled water or other beverages are also included and pre-requested on the website. Pricing was $65, plus a bunch of NYC fees/taxes and a 20% driver gratuity, ending up at $98.96 total. A taxi is approximately $35, so the Mercedes transfer was a special treat. Now, about the Sofitel: 1. We received a complimentary upgrade from our Internet special $269 rate for a queen bed room to a king bed room, upper floor, #2203. 2. Next to us, rooms 2201 & 2202 are at the end of the hallway, with a door that closes off the end of the hallway. So by closing the hallway door; you would have a small private locking foyer between the two adjoining, across the hall rooms. This would be perfect for a family who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need connecting rooms, but adjoining rooms (across the hall) with a private foyer. So, if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the case for you, with older teenagers, or elderly parents, inquire about rooms ending in 01 and 02. 3. The guest room was beautiful, as mentioned by many previous reviews. The only amenity that I would like to see in the future would be a plasma/LCD with high-definition signal feed. 4. We enjoyed two breakfasts at Gaby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only restaurant & bar. The food and service was excellent. Continental breakfast was $18, and the full American breakfast was $21. Classic Eggs Benedict was also $21. Juice and coffee are included in that price, and the coffee is served tableside in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153French Press\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and was very robust, which we, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the French guests, appreciate. 5. The Lobby isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t large, but sufficient, with about 5 or 6 gathering areas for small groups to congregate before heading out. There is also a small room off the lobby with a couple of computers for you to check your emails or flight status. 6. From the hotel, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a couple of blocks to Times Square, the Broadway theatres and Fifth Avenue shopping. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a $10 cab ride to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 7. We had dinner at the Russian Tea Room and Trattoria Depo Teatra, and I posted reviews for those two restaurants.

Evening room service included two small bottles of Evian and a small box of chocolates. Room service was excellent but expensive, as was the bar and restaurant downstairs.

Didn't try the food in the hotel, because there's a lovely diner just down the street which serves brilliant breakfasts, and who wants to eat in a hotel at night, when you can hit the New York streets! The room was lovely, very clean and very spacious. The bed was the most comfortable bed ever, we called it our marshmallow because it was so warm and squishy. Housekeeping came in twice a day to sort the covers out, \"turndown service\" I think its called, she also brought Evian water which was a nice touch.

The New York Sofitel was nice, but not as nice as other Sofitels. No comparison to the Chicago Sofitel. We booked through expedia and did get a very good rate, so maybe they gave us one of their worst rooms. Our very old T.V didn't work very well, but they came up quickly to try and fix it. They offered to move us to another room, but the TV wasn't that important to us. We were told they will be updating the rooms soon, which needs to be done. On the plus side, I would stay at the NY Sofitel again and recommend it, but only if the price was right. The beds were very comfortable just like all Sofitel beds. Very clean rooms. The service was very good and quick. The staff was above average for Sofitel. This is just by comparison. In my experience some of the Sofitels front desk staff, (usually the staff from France) can be abrupt, but that is part of the French feel right. Well not in New York. Everyone was very nice, friendly and helpful. Another big plus was having The Red Flame restaurant so close.

Needless to say, we were not disappointed. I must preface these comments by stating that I am a hotel snob, & mind you, the Sofitel is not a five-star hotel, but it does not claim to be. (Although some of the service we received was better than some we have experienced at certain 5-stars.) Location: The Sofitel is situated 44th & 5th, making it just about the perfect location for walking to just about anything (Times Square, Broadway, 5th Avenue, Empire State Building, Rockefeller, MOMA, etc.). Though it is a fair (but entirely manageable) walking distance to Central Park. Service: The service we received was prompt & unobtrusive. Our rooms were cleaned meticulously morning & evening; I requested once for extra towels & note was made for the remainder of our stay (unlike some other five star we've stayed). (We also appreciated the bottles of Evian & box of chocolates each evening.) The concierge was helpful at recommending restaurants & obtaining reservations. Ammenities: The fitness center was sufficiently equipped with treadmills, weights, etc. Our room was a suite on the top floor with a view of the Empire State Building from the bedroom & Rockefeller Center from the sitting room. The rooms themselves are not especially large, but more than sufficient (though more storage space would have been nice). The beds were quite comfortable. The bathroom was spacious enough (not huge) & extremely well lit. The least appealing aspect of the hotel is Gaby's where we found the food to be mediocre at best. Not bad, but not worth eating there twice. Would I recommend Sofitel to friends? ABSOLUTELY.

The room itself was lovely and the bathroom was to die for! The bed, as everybody else has said, was fantastic - just wish we could have fitted it in the suitcase! The hotel's location is also excellent - when you come out of the door you turn right and you are a 5 minutes walk from Times Square, on the way passing The Red Flame which is also as good as all the other reviews say, and by turning left at the hotel and after 5 minutes you are at Grand Central Station. We would recommend the Circle Line boat trip, and Empire State Building as good points to view New York. As far as steaks go, we met up with a family member who works in Manhattan and he treated us to a meal at the Capital Grille. We had the most amazing food at this restaurant starting off with French Onion Soup which was layered with Gruyere cheese. The steaks are just to die for, washed down with excellent wine and just for more badness we finished off with cheesecake .... you have to be bad sometimes!

I will give you our tips for a great trip to NY, and also things to avoid We didnt try the breakfast at the hotel and followed others advice and went to the red flame diner a couple of doors down from the hotel. A bit rough and ready, but good food and service make it all good and great value. If you want to really splash out and have a world class breakfast, take a cab to Le Parker Meridian up near Central Park, and BOOK into Norma's inside Le Meridian, all they do is breakfast and boy do they do it well, outstanding and a bit pricy but you will NEVER have a better breakfast, make sure you book, while we were there people were being quoted 1.5 hours for a table and still staying!! At the same venue is a Burger Joint that you wouldnt find in a month of Sundays, tiny place hidden behind a curtain at Le Meridian, signed only by a small neon burger sign, keep an eye out for it, its easy to miss! World Class burgers and fries, and thats all they do but wow its done well. Avoid Rainbow Room Grill like the plague, it was a fab view no doubt there but the food was appalling and they 'recommend' a 20% tip on a $300 bill, and that was with no dessert or coffee, massive rip off and not to be repeated. Book in at Metrazur in Grand Central Terminal - sounds mad to eat in a station, but what a station, the ambiance is amazing and ask when you book for a balcony table, you wont speak much but you will marvel at the view! After Metrazur cross the main floor up the stairs, come out of the main doors and turn left and head into Campbells Apartment, a hidden gem of a cocktail bar, small and atmospheric...the mojitos and prohibition punch were the best we have ever tasted! Gotham Bar and Grill was divine, words cant measure it, service and food to die for, every bit was amazing. Go to Woodbury Outlet about an hour out of the city for discount designer shopping heaven!! We went by bus so got to asee a bit of the countryside Forget about Empire State building, the place is a dump, queues were 3.5 hours and once I got up there I couldnt wait to come down as I was so naffed off from queuing and pushing, it was rubbish...head for Top of the Rock at the Rockerfeller centre, no queue, up and down in 30 mins, and much nicer, glass panels so you can see more, a bit smaller than Empire State but the same experience, but no queuing and messing about.

The location is perfect, with a subway stop 8 minutes walk away, and so central that taxi rides are quick and reasonable. On arrival, free sparkling water and truffles were left in our room. The breakfast at the hotel restaurant is excellent, with bottomless cups of coffee and juice, complimentary newspapers, and large portions - for $20 you have a hearty start to the day - contrary to other reviewers, I would not recommend the \"Flame\" diner - this is truly second rate. On 45th St, bw 5th and Madison, there's \"Dishes\" where a tolerable espresso can be had, along with quick, healthy and tasty lunches, plus Valrhona chocolate donuts! The concierges are all knowledgable, and will happily use their connections to snare a table at one of their recommended eateries - for instance, Osteria Al Doge, down the road, a bustling Italian restaurant, with great food. If you want any criticisms, I suppose the bathtub could have been deeper, and the air conditioning system was somewhat noisy (it can be turned off, with little or no effect on the room temperature); the wifi room internet costs $10 per day. The hotel runs some special rates, so it's possible to get a room for around $250/night plus taxes.

This was the first time we had stayed more centrally and to be fair I had some concerns that noise would be an issue. However, this was not the case. The room was good without being great, but being a light sleeper this was more than made up for by the fact it was quiet. And in a busy, hustling city like NY, this is a blessing. The location could not be better. Basically two blocks to Times Square and almost everything in close reach. Having stayed near Central Park previously the one criticism of that area is that it is a fair old walk down to the Theatre District and Macy's etc etc. From the Sofitel its fantastic. Everything is within walking distance altho I would still recommend the bus tour 2 day pass as a means to getting around New York cheaply. And you learn things on the way round also!

A couple of helpful hints. Use the Hotel's town car service for pick up and drop off's at the airport. It's only marginally dearer than a standard cab, and an aawful lot more comfortable. When you add toll fees etc to a standard cab its practically the same. The hotel arrange this without hassle. The guys at the door can also aid you with this on the way back. Avoid the Hotel bar...its pretentious beyond belief and the service here (unlike the rest of the Hotel) was very very poor. They were more interested in preening themselves and looking cool for the business people populating the bar than actually serving anyone. Besides NY is full of good bars and restaurants (by the way the Indian restaurant 200yds to the left down the street of the Sofitel is very very good). Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great starting base in NY. Its clean, comfortable and stylish. Even better, if you get a deal I cant think of better value in NY, as its location is perfect. We'll be back here...we'll just avoid the bar!", "Date": "December 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cOut of their way outstanding\u201d", "Author": "vendorcloud", "ReviewID": "UR6484841", "Content": "We did our annual shopping trip in New York and stayed at the Sofitel. I had holds on places like the W, The Palace and The Westin Times Square but none of those compare. Sofitel brings the sophistication of Europe to 5th Ave in a way many others cannot. I am a longtime guest of the Essex House but since their change of ownership didn't have a favorite. I do now. Check in was immediate, friendly and accurate. This was a busy weekend in New York and it could have been problematic. I like their bellman bells that they play for \"front\" service. The room was as planned and clean as you see in other reviews. Of course I found a few black spots in the shower but nothing like some of the photos you see herein of the W etc. This place visits your room twice daily to attend to things. Extra towels and room service were 20 minutes or less. They could use an update to electronics with flatscreens and free WiFi but that's minor. I am sure they will figure it out. The towels had a \"holiday inn\" feel to them also, but again, they will figure it out if enough of us complain. I couldnt find my ipod charger and their faulous head of security John Sheehan not only found one left by another guest but charged my ipod while i was out shopping. Front door staff and such were efficient too. The only downside (and why i gave only 4 dots instead of 5) is that their bar and restaurant are lacking any type of ambiance and panache that most New York 5th avenue area hotels have. At the holiday time, there are great fireplaces crackling, nice cocktails moving about and cheer. Not here. The bartender was majorly UNDER and he was complaining to his boss. The boss, in turn, was complaining about him to another worker. It was very unprofessional. They are also not wheelchair proficient (I am not a user but...) so that our stroller had to go down a bunch of stairs to get to the bar/restaurant. The breakfast was average and very expensive. Try Norma's at the Le Meridien for breakfast. That place rocks. All in all I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great location and attention to minor details.", "Date": "December 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cFantastic staff at the Sofitel\u201d", "Author": "dueykairyup", "ReviewID": "UR6472160", "Content": "Not that I have a ton of experience staying in big city hotels, but I have enough to know that the staff makes or breaks an experience. And I must say that the staff at the Hotel Sofitel NYC was over-the-top. There were eleven of us (ranging in age between 6 and 75) plus luggage plus a wheelchair traveling in a very large stretch hummer. Upon our arrival the doormen and bellhops were incredibly personable, professional, and efficient unloading our luggage and whisking it away and then gracefully ushering us into the grand hotel. We arrived well before check-in time, yet four of our five rooms were already prepared. The staff at the reception desk was very friendly and handled the confusion of our particular check-in quite quickly (five rooms reserved under different names but paid for by me). Although we were on a smoking floor (as requested), the smell was very negligible. That's remarkable. Our rooms were impeccably clean, and throughout our stay the 24-hour housekeeping staff on our floor (the 8th floor) was very attentive. I will say, however, that although we all received turn-down service (which included complimentary bottles of Evian water), only some of us got all of the little touches such as the box of chocolates while some of us didn't -- that would be my only comment. Room service was quick and efficient and, I feel, well-priced. A plate of delicious cheeses and fruit for two was $12.00 and arrived within 15 minutes. The concierge desk provided asked-for information with professionalism. The doormen were so observant and anticipated our approach every time\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot once did any of us have to open a door ourselves. Although we never needed a taxi, I did observe how quickly and efficiently one was hailed for others many times. Check-out was also handled quite quickly, and I was very impressed with the doorman who cleared the much-congested roadway outside for our hummer to pull up to the door. I must mention Catherine (not certain of the spelling of her name), the front desk manager who administered our reservation and who was on duty during our weekend stay. I cannot say enough about her. She handled the arrangement of our five rooms with aplomb so that all of us could be accommodated comfortably and together. During our stay she was indescribably attentive, especially honoring my daughter with some special birthday gifts (which was the reason for the trip -- my daughter's 18th birthday). Catherine made us feel as if we were the most important guests in the hotel -- she remembered what our planned activities were and every time we entered the lobby she came out from behind the reception desk to ask how we enjoyed such-n-such. She is an incredible asset to the Hotel Sofitel NYC. I cannot thank her and the staff enough for such a memorable stay. As for the accommodations themselves, the rooms were small BUT much larger than expected. We have experienced that rooms in NYC hotels tend to be small, but at the Sofitel we did not feel cramped thanks to the mirrored closet doors on one side and the huge window on the other. A plus is that the window can be opened for fresh air. The room had just about everything one could need \u00e2\u20ac\u201c except a coffee maker (presumably 24-hour room service can handle that request). The honors bar was well-stocked with snacks and drinks (alcoholic and nonalcoholic). The price list was in the closet (along with the safe and a basket of other necessities) which was a little bit too much out of the way to find before indulging, and we discovered, after the fact, that prices were very expensive ($4.50 for a small can of Pringles, for example, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not experienced enough to know if this is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.) With a variety of pillows and a pillow-top mattress, the beds were very comfortable except that, although wonderfully fluffy, the duvet was the sole covering and it was a little too heavy and too warm. Adding a sheet as an alternative would have been ideal (and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure a call to housekeeping could have solved that.) Among our five rooms we had 2 kings, 2 queens, and a room with 2 twins. The king was large enough to accommodate two adults and a 6-year-old. There would have been space in any of our five rooms for a rollaway although it would have been tight. The bathroom was huge and had a tub with hand-held shower and a separate shower stall. The countertop was expansive and held a variety of luxuries including fresh flowers and a candle, as well as many nicely-appointed necessities. The mirror was large and well-lit and somehow did not fog up during a hot shower. There was also a swing-away magnifying mirror. Excellent water pressure made for a superior shower. The towels were over-sized and absorbent, and the complimentary bathrobe was a great plus. Use of the bathmat was mandatory since the beautiful marble floor was very slippery when wet. Privacy was compromised a little bit due to the crack between the double doors of the bathroom; however, the doors were not facing into the room itself, so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a huge issue. Two fun touches were the commode seat that closed automatically and the hidden speaker which piped in the sound from the TV. The room was well lit with a number of lamps. As for electronics and technology, high speed internet access was available for an extra fee, and there was a keyboard of some type for wireless access to something on the TV. None of us had time to try out either of these. The alarm clock was too much of a high-tech gizmo for any of us to figure out. One in our party gave up and called the front desk for a wake-up call (which they received exactly on time in the morning.) We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at the Gaby restaurant on-site in the hotel, but we did stop in at the bar just before last call (midnight). It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t crowded at this time and there was only one server. He made up for the unfortunate slow service by offering us another round even though it was past last call\u00e2\u20ac\u201da nice touch. I don't believe there is a health club on-site, and I'm not certain if Sofitel has a partnership with a private club -- we didn't have time to pursue that amenity. The public areas of the hotel included a lovely gift shop and a large lobby full of very comfortable chairs and couches and tables. There was a fireplace full of lit candles, and being the holiday season, the Christmas decorations were beautiful and elegant. French influence was found everywhere from the accents of the staff and their welcoming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bonjours\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the magazines and newspapers found in the lobby and the gift shop. For some, the price may be deemed expensive, but I feel that $500 per night for accommodations of this caliber in NYC during the Christmas season was a good value. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location was perfect: \u00c2\u00bd block east was Fifth Avenue and two blocks west was Times Square. Although 44th Street was sometimes congested, it was incredibly quiet and calming inside the hotel. Without a doubt we will stay at the Hotel Sofitel NYC again. As well, if ever in a city that has a Sofitel, we will purposely seek it out. It is my belief that a fantastic staff is not unique in the NYC location but that top-notch service is a philosophy of Sofitel.", "Date": "December 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cWorth the money\u201d", "Author": "VaTraveler12", "ReviewID": "UR6436912", "Content": "I'm not a luxury traveler, but I will spend the money if necessary to ensure a great trip.

The reception area is very nice with friendly receptionists. It is a french hotel chain, you are always welcomed with Bonjour or bonsoir, which personally annoyed me, but others may find this sophisticated! We had upgraded to a room with a king size bed, which on the web was only up to the 14th floor but as I had previously joined the privilege club online (do this at least 2 months before as it takes ages for the card to come through) we were upgraded to the 20th floor and had a view of the Chrysler building which is nice BUT I would say this is also at the back of the hotel - but who cares you are not in your room all day, so looking out of the window and seeing the lit up chrysler definitely made me realised I was in NYC. The bed though was the most fantastic thing in the room (which was normal New York size - small, the benjamin is a lot bigger) it was so soft it was heaven after a heavy day walking around the city. In the room every night was a box of 4 chocolates & 2 small bottles of water which were free and appreciated. I had also happened to mention that it was our anniversary and like others who had stayed at the hotel before us who were also celebrating we had a bottle of champagne on ice waiting for us when we got there. The Gaby bar - was very nice which also served a small selection of bar food/sandwiches but it is expensive $11+tip for a beer and a juice. The location of the hotel is very handy just 2 streets over from times square so close enough to walk to with no effort at all and also far enough away so you do not hear the Times Sq bustle. For breakfast I had read that others had eaten at the Red Flame diner just past the hotel and I would agree that this was very nice, quick service and very good food at a decent price. One thing I must say is the taxes are not included normally in the prices on the hotels website which were a little bit more than I expected but still ok in the scheme of things.

One time I was just coming out of the bathroom and she practically already had the door open. Very disturbing. Make sure you have the do not disturb sign on your door or they will keep coming back. We thought that one warning that we were still there was enough, apparently not. We used the conceirge to make a late dinner suggestion for us and he made the reservation under the wrong name.

We had superb views of the Empire State Building, the Chrysler building and many others.

Check-in was quick with no waiting in line and the receptionist was extremely friendly and professional. She had a lovely French accent and pleasantly answered a few questions we had. We also rec'd 2 complimentary drink tickets - this may have been because we were first time guests. Our room was on the 14th floor and faced on 45th street . The view was basicall buildings across 45th Street and a small park. During our stay, we did see the view from the elevator lobby on the 29th floor which was also primarily a view of nearby buildings. I believe you may get a decent view in some but not all of the rooms on the highest (20-29) floors. Our room (incl. bathroom) was exceptionally clean and in perfect shape. The room was average size with king bed & side tables, small table and sitting chair, and low desk/bureau with TV, desk & chair & minibar. There was also a good sized closet and drawer storage area and large dressing mirrors. The good sized bathroom was mostly marble and glass with both a tub and walk in shower. Housekeeping each day was flawless. We had dinner one evening in the hotel restaurant, Gaby's. The food was excellent and we used our free drink cards with dinner for 2 glasses of champagne. There are also banquet tables near the bar if you want to get a drink (and possibly a light bite to eat?). NYC has many great hotels in many different parts of the city. This is one we would certainly use again.", "Date": "October 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Beach", "Title": "\u201cNothing Special!\u201d", "Author": "junkemail669", "ReviewID": "UR5943278", "Content": "I searched TripAdvisor to get some ideas about where to stay when I visited New York and Sofitel was at the top of the list, so, I booked a three night stay.

We also pre-paid for transfers with a shuttle company, but would advise people to either treat themselves to a taxi journey (around $50 one way) or to get the AirTrain from JFK to Jamaica Avenue and then get the overground train to Penn Station and finally a taxi to the Sofitel - grand total of $30 for the two of us. When we got to the hotel we decided to upgrade to a room with a King sized bed, this was an extra $80 a day, but worth every cent. The room was roomy, confortable, spotlessly clean and the only critisism was that if you like to soak in a bath, you will be disappiinted as the bath is very shallow and rather short.. Other than that we could not fault the accomodation. The staff at the hotel were all very friendly - and not in a false 'I am doing my job' way. The concierge service was very good and they gave good tips for where to eat etc. If you stay at the Sofitel, go the the Red Flame diner for breakfast, it is extremely good value and the food is excellent.

The staff are absolutely amazing ! so nice and friendly and would go totally out of their way to help you (The lady on the reception desk was absolutely brilliant) Rooms are gorgeous and bed is Fabulous ! We checked in and were trying to organise somewhere for our 26 Wedding guests from Ireland to meet on the morning of our Wedding (for which the lobby was perfect, lots of lovely seating area) and when they heard we were getting married they gave us an upgrade from a Queen room to a King, the lady said they would have given us a suite but they had none available that day, but if we left all our luggage ready the next day they would move us when we were at our Wedding ! we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe it ! When we returned back that Night after our Wedding they had moved rooms for us and the Room was completely and utterly UNBELIEVABLE ! firstly there was a bottle of champagne and a card from the staff and strawberries dipped in chocolate waiting for us which was beautiful ! such a lovely touch ! the Room was massive with TWO bathrooms, a sofa area a big bedroom and best of all a HUGE SUN TERRACE outside the patio doors with table and chairs and two sunbeds !!!!! we were totally blown away ! I had never seen anything like it and never even thought it could exist in the City ! we were sitting out on terrace looking right at the Chrysler Building easily the most beautiful building in the city, it was fabulous, and all our guests came over the next day and we sat in the sun and drank champagne all day ! (no one could believe the room) then ordered room service that evening which was very nice too. I can easily say the Sofitel made our Wedding Day truly MAGICAL ! It is also situated brilliantly, just short walks to the main attractions and on a side street so no street noise whatsoever. Red Flame Diner is ace for breakfast! The Top of the Rock is good, but it is $18 each to go up to the outside viewing area, which we did a few days before our Wedding, but on our Wedding day we went up to the Rainbow Room for cocktails which is also in the Rockefeller Building and only 2 floors down from the top of the rock and we paid about the same and had a cocktail and were not outside in the wind ! (and we had cosmopolitans which were supposedly invented in the Rainbow Room !) the views from it were amazing no different than the TOTR, the cocktails were expensive but definitely worth going up for one ! but we were lucky as the lady waitress bought us a free cocktail as we had just got married ! I would also recommend a trip to China Town (Canal Street) especially for girlies who love handbags ! bargains galore !

All the staff were very polite although I did find their accents quite hard to understand and I think they thought the same of me. We were escorted to the escalators and once we got to our room (which was on the 23rd floor) we found an amazing room with a bottle of champagne and a welcome card from all the staff. The bed was gorgeous, and just as comfortable as it looked. The bathroom was huge and it had a shower big enough for 2 (ooh errr!) and a separate bath, also loads of free goodies and fresh flowers. The bed is incredibly comfortable and is hard to get out of in the morning but the promise of the wonderful shower helps. The TV has 40 channels and their was always something on, its particularly good for weather and Times Square info as their seemed to be different celebrities their on a daily basis. There are also pay per view channels for the latest films if you have the time. The room was cleaned once a day immaculately, and a turndown service is offered between 6 and 9 which can be a little bit annoying as that was the time we usually were having a snooze before going out in the evening as all the walking does tire you out. However, this is when fresh water is given to you though and it is appreciated in the humid conditions of New York. We only visited the bar once, it was very pleasant but not very lively and the drinks were on the expensive side, 2 vodka and cokes were $24 dollars so make sure you have plenty of cash, they do have very tasty complimentary bar snacks.

A porter took our bags from the curb up to our room while we got the keys. The whole process took about 3 minutes. We got exactly what we asked for - a room on an upper floor with a view of the ESB. We also got mineral water instead of champagne as I requested via email a few days before we arrived - perfect. Check out was even faster than check in. There was never a wait at the front desk for us. Room ----------------------------- The best feature was a very comfortable bed - maybe the best I've ever had in a hotel. The bathroom was all marble and came with decent amenities. The walls were pretty quiet - heard some hall noise but nothing from outside. The curtains blocked out all light in the morning. Guests ----------------------------- The guests were a mix of Europeans and Americans. Some couples. Some families. Some students. Some dressed up. Some casual. Mostly tourists. Overall a sharp middle-class group. In comparison, we stopped by the Super 8 a couple of blocks away to visit some friends one morning and the crowd there was quite different - hanging around the lobby in their pajamas for example. Location ----------------------------- Pretty good. It's about halfway between the Times Square / Broadway area the St. Patrick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s / Rockefeller Center area (but so are about 100 other hotels). 44th between 5th and 6th has some good restaurant choices - decent breakfast joint, an Indian lunch buffet, a classy Greek restaurant, a slick bistro / bar. The Algonquin is also on this block. You have a lot of good apr\u00c3\u00a8s-New York choices right next to (and in) your hotel. Other Compliments ----------------------------- Despite the polished appearance of the lobby they play jazzy techno on the sound system - which I thought was a very cool touch. The halls on our floor had red marble, red carpets, and cinnamon potpourri scent filling the air. The room safe was convenient. The turn-down service / towel change / free Evian was very nice - we essentially got room service twice a day. Complaints ----------------------------- 1. The ice machine on our floor wasn't working. 2. The TV remote control didn't work. 3. The hallway on our floor was too warm. 4. A cabinet door in our room was broken off one of its hinges. 5. We could not get anywhere near the computers in the lobby. Even at 11 PM all 3 were overtaken by kids writing email - when all we wanted was 5 minutes to check out a bar review or the Troussard's hours of operation. Pretty annoying. 6.

The bed was heavenly, a featherbed and a soft duvet as well as high thread count sheets made for deep sleeping after wandering all over Manhatten.

Then the doorman found me a limousine to the airport for $35.00 US (normally a limo is over $100.) Not all cabs have air conditioning that works and many smell, so a clean cool limo ride out of the city to La Guardia is always welcomed.

Also.....I wanted to extend thanks to the Sofitel for the following reason. The day before we were set to leave, my wife got food poisoning from the Rock Center Cafe in Rockefeller Center. She was sick all day and night to the point she couldnt even stand up. Our flight did not leave until 8:30pm on that day, so we had originally planned to store our luggage and do some more sightseeing. Well, that obviously wasnt going to happen. I asked the front desk if we could have late check out (only expecting a couple hours at most). She gave us until 8pm for no extra charge because of the circumstances. Normally, they would charge half the daily rate which would have been an extra $175. Needless to say, we were very grateful for their cooperation. Also, in past cases where we have been granted late checkout, the housekeepers bother you every 15 minutes until you leave. We stayed until 6pm without a peep out of anyone.

I made reservations at the Sofitel Hotel because of the high recommendations made here. I was not disappointed. From the time of our arrival we were treated as honored guests. In looking for a location in the hotel to meet with my client I was introduced to the business sales director, Ms Francoise Christine, and she personally took us to several rooms to find the perfect setting for my meeting. The first evening, just prior to our \"night on the town\" to celebrate our anniversary, my wife and I were treated to a wonderful bottle of French champagne, compliments of the hotel. The beds were totally \"as advertised\" and our suite on the 25th floor had a great view and was a bargain by New York standards. You really can't find a better location for a pleasure visit. It's central to everything..... 5th Avenue shopping, Times Square, and the theater district. Everything was within easy walking distance. Away from the hotel, which is hard to leave because of the pleasantries of the entire staff, we saw Mamma Mia, which was great, light-hearted fun. We dined the first evening at the Divine Bar known for its wine and tapa selections. While nice, it didn't meet the standards of the recommendations I had read. Nevertheless, it was very convenient to Broadway and our show that evening. Our second night we dined with my clients at Michael's Restaurant, W. 55th St., on the recommedation of my next door neighbor and we arrived on \"celebrity night\"! We dined early and the restaurant was almost empty on our arrival at 6:15pm and the group following us in included Mary Tyler Moore and Bernadette Peters. Shortly afterward, Frank Gifford took the table next to ours (sans Kathy Lee) with another couple. The food was quite good (I'm a tough food critic) but the ambience and wine selection were wonderful. We completed the evening with a visit to the Gotham City Comedy Club headling Tony Rock, Chris Rock's younger brother. Anyone going to NYC should strongly consider a visit to the Sofitel Hotel.

So why has staying at the Sofitel caused us to go into print? Because the Hotel made a great visit to New York even better. We were on the 23rd floor with a great view of the Chrysler Building. The room was a good size with ample space around the bed and a separate seating area. The bathroom had both bath and separate walk-in shower which we consider essential. The non-smoking room was well presented, clean with good quality furniture, towels etc. The bed was simply the best Hotel bed we have experienced - just so comfortable. The room was serviced twice a day which meant when you dropped back to the Hotel (great location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c central but quiet) to have a midday shower (its hot and humid in July) you knew that the clean room and towels you were using would be replaced for the evening.

We were 2 to a room and the european twin beds (longer and wider than standard twin in the states, although not as wide as a full bed) were parallel to the Wynn beds in Las Vegas.

The first few mornings, we followed earlier advice to get breakfast in neighboring coffee shops as to give support to the common travellers' claim for more reasonable breakfast charge-out. Indeed the in-house American breakfast sums up with gratuity and tax to $26. Nonetheless, the various coffee shops we tried out charged between $15 and $19 with incomparable quality and service. The last two mornings, we had in-house American breakfast including espresso, which for Europeans unused to American breakfast and especially what is commonly called \"coffee\", appears still to be the lesser of two evils. 4.

I booked it online direct with the Sofitel as I found this was cheaper. The trip was a surprise for my husbands 40th birthday and after requesting a high floor we got a free upgrade on arrival to floor 26. (We didnt get the champagne that others have mentioned but didnt let this spoil it). The reception staff and Concierge were always helpful and we were allowed to check out 1 hour later and left our luggage at the front desk until we had to catch our flight. Great view from our wiindow of the Chrysler Building and round the corner from Empire State Building. The room size was ample for the two of us and yes the beds are the best we have ever slept in. We have never walked as much as we did in New York and we felt the comfort of the beds more than met our standards. (I agree you do need comfortable shoes). Bathroom was quite large and the room had lovely finishing touches and we were told the weather forecast and given free water every night by the maid service. Did not eat at the Sofitel mainly due to being expensive but there are so many great places to eat that this was not a problem. Turn right when you come out of the hotel and there is a great diner called Red Flame which serves great breakfasts which were great value. Also try Planet Hollywood they do BOGOF drinks between 4 and 6 pm. Other good places were TGI Fridays which had several locations throughout NY. There are a couple of good Irish pubs on 45th Street, one of which is called Connollys which do nice food and it has a good atmosphere. On a Sunday there is a big street market going down this street which was quite good. The hotel is located within 5mins walk from Times Square and close to Grand Central Station, Chrysler building, ESB, Bryant Park and Rockefellar centre. It took us about 15-20mins to walk to Central Park. We used the subway to get down to Ground Zero and the Statue of Liberty which was hassle free. One experience worth doing is the Helicopter Tour called the Big Apple which takes you over the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island and down the Hudson river with Liberty Helicopters. Try to catch a show on Broadway, we went to see Chicago at the Ambassador Theatre which was excellent. Shopping in New York is excellent we found Maceys as one of the best stores (dont forget to get your discount card from the customer service desk in Maceys). We flew into Newark and got taxis to and from the Sofitel which cost about \u00c2\u00a335 including tip one way. Whilst in NY we had two extreme sides of the weather - first 2 days were scorching hot and the last 2 days were downpours but the hotel very kindly borrowed us a large umbrella so we were still able to walk about and not get wet. We flew with Continental airlines which were also excellent and by being able to check in online at the hotel we found this saved us queuing up at Newark. All we had to do was drop off our suitcases at a desk. New York is a great city where we felt safe walking around and we would definitely stay at the Sofitel again, its a bit pricey as you don't spend much time in your bedroom while visiting NY but well worth it for a once in a lifetime visit.", "Date": "May 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "perth, australia", "Title": "\u201cok, but not number 1\u201d", "Author": "kate227patt", "ReviewID": "UR5066114", "Content": "Stayed for two nights early May in a suite as a special trip.

Take the subway to Bowling Green then its just across the road. Head to Strawberry Fields in Central Park - there's usually a good crowd with musicians so you can have a sing song.

The place is simply splendid, fresh flowers every-other-day and everyone (barr some but i'll explain later) is so helpful. We were recommended to get a high room, we were on the 15th floor and could see nothing but when you realise that New York is only huge due to everything being so high you'll understand! The lack of view didn't spoil a thing, the hotel was just the perfect place to relax after a hard day of walking and shopping. We didn't eat in the hotel cos they tend to be more expensive and we'd had some other recommendations. The only thing that let the Sofitel down was the fact that my girlfriend and i are quite young so the doormen didn't -ever- open the door for us on the way in. The concierge seemed reluctant too, but yet overly helpful to the older guests! Ah well. If you stay here go to breakfast at The Manhattan Cafe across the road, round the back. It's fantastic! And for dinner Michael Jordans The Steak House, at Grand Central Station is great but dress smart, it's a bit glam! Buffalo steak is superb, but the garlic bread for starters is divine! The other place we tried was Del Friscos on roughly 49th and 6th, the McGraw-Hill Building. It's a bit expensive but we were sat next to Colin Farrell so who can complain!!!

Too much to say about the city itself other than it feels like you are walking around in a movie set!!

Travel tips: For a cheap breakfast go to the Red Flame diner, turn right out of hotel, 1 min away. Always busy, great bacon and eggs! Dinner - we tried Tavern on the Green. Firm believer people should make their own minds up about restaurants, as everyone likes different things, but we were very disappointed, overpriced & boring food which lacked flavour, no atmosphere....but good location though and pretty park views. Top viewing spot - \"Top of the Rock\" observation centre at Rockefeller centre. 67 floors up, stunning views, cost $17 per person. Well worth it.

For those that are not familar with Sofitel, it's a French chain that is very popular in Europe, the middle east, and Africa, but only has like 12 properties in the U.S. I'd compare it to a Westin, Le Meridien, or W. Sofitel is certainly as good as any of those chains and I'd argue that they're actually better due to the room amenities they provide that American chains lack. Those little extras make all the difference. Although it's ranked #1 in New York by this website, it's certainly not the best hotel in NY by ultra luxury standards.

The front desk staff offered us an open room with two oversized twin beds (which was a higher cost when I booked our reservations) and suggested that we would enjoy our stay much better as we could both stretch out and sleep in our own beds.

The bathroom is what really made the room enjoyable. There was both a separate glass shower and a porcelain tub. The walls and floor of the bath were all marble. There was ample room for toiletries, a magnifying mirror, adequate electrical plug ins, and good lighting. The only drawback I could see to the bathroom was the lack of a ventilation fan.

The menu is expensive. (Food is good) The workout room needs towels and tuned up machines.

My partner booked the hotel as part of a trip to New York to celebrate my 40th. We selected the hotel based on trip advisor reviews and booked through expedia. After requesting a high room (as per previous trip advisor recommendations) and notifying the hotel that I was celebrating a special occasion, we were dissapointed to be located on the 7th floor. Apparently this was due to the hotel being full. We were however, promised a high floor for the next 3 nights and this resulted in a relocation to the 21st floor and a view of the Empire state. Hotel: staff were generally very friendly, accommodating and attentive. Ambience: the hotel in my opinion lacked any real atmosphere, there was no buzz in the lobby (probably due to the general layout). Prices: as a tourist you don't visit New York to stay in your hotel room, therefore, we didn't use any of the facilities, although did notice that the food prices were very expensive. $18 dollars for a waffle plus tax and service charge and probably a tip! Rooms: as many have mentioned the beds were very very comfortable. The bathroom although luxurious was very cold, please add heating!! Maid service: again the rooms were cleaned to a high standard, however, we only once had the room turned down as we were generally getting ready to go out when the maid knocked at 19:00. (call me a cynic, the only time my 40th celebrations were mentioned was on our last morning when the maid knocked on the door and wished me happy birthday!!) Concierge: again very informative and friendly and a fountain of knowledge. Location: excellent, only two blocks from times square or fifth avenue. Tips: there is an excellent breakfast diner called the red flame on the same street, turn right outside the hotel. Get to the empire state early to avoid the crowds. Try a restaurant called Tao its fantastic! Ice Skate in Central Park! Avoid the cafe part of the Boathouse restaurant in Central Park. Get to the Central Line queues early to ensure you are able to get inside the statue of liberty. Otherwise you have to be satisfied with a walk around (which is fantastic anyway).

My husband sensing my disappointment requested a move to a higher floor and a larger room. Although we were moved to a slightly larger room on the 27th floor it was definitely not what I had expected. (the champagne eventually arrived after the relocation) The view was better but the room was quite tired with black marks on the carpet and curtains that required a good washing.

I've read about the beds and I have to say that it's all true. The beds were so damn comfortable it made it tough to get up in the morning.

The location was fabulous. Check in: we were greeted at the door by a doorman and concierge in French, and were allowed to check in early for no extra fee. We stayed on the 22nd floor. The view was of another building which was rather disappointing. They also let us check out late for no extra fee. Be sure to sign up for a free loyalty card, that comes with extra upgrades and little perks. Our room: was nice, with contemporary decor, but very small. Not a lot of room to move around. It was clean, linen fresh daily. A thin robe and slippers were provided. TV was a 27 inch. Again, nothing you wouldnt expect at a 3 star hotel. Turn down service every nite with Evian water and weather outlook for the next day. the BED: okay, so I was really curious to see if this bed lived up to its reputation (the pessimist in me) but it does. It was absolutely heavenly. Down sheets and comforter, and pillows. I slept in one position, never moved. The room was nice and dark at night, and truthfully, as a mother of two, this was the best sleep I have had in a very long time. We slept until 10 every morning. Food: We chose to eat outside the restaurant. The Red Flame is a little diner 2 doors down and was great. Good food, fast service, and the usual New York treatment from the staff. The wait was never more than 10 minutes. I did not like the fact that after 11pm, no one was in the lobby. Anyone could have walked in the hotel, so that was kinda odd. There is only 3 computers in the lobby that are always occupied. But overall, it was nice, I will stay again, but for a better deal.

I was disappointed with this hotel. Sofitel New York is a comfortable 4 star hotel for the average tourist. You should not expect high standards of service or luxury staying here. Sofitel is a 4 star, not a 5 star hotel. People travelling to this hotel should expect comfort, but not luxury. It is not a luxury hotel with consistent excellent service in the same league as The Ritz Carlton, The St. Regis Hotel, or Four Seasons Hotel in New York. Having checked out these five star properties while in New York, for my next stay in New York I would probably choose the St. Regis. The room rates at Sofitel New York are very high. I was paying $US500 a night for a queen bed room with no view. Good points: -Modern marble bathroom with separate bath and shower -Comfortable queen sized bed -Midtown location near Broadway and Times Square Bad points: -Room service ordered on my first night arrived almost cold. I ordered a Vegetable Lasagne and it was luke warm. Also, the night menu seems to suit the hotel rather than containing appealing options. - I returned to the hotel around midnight a couple of nights to find absolutely no staff on the property at all (no doormen, and concierge and front desks were both empty). For a 4 star hotel I think this is not satisfactory. Also, when I returned late on a Saturday night (Sunday morning), there was one staff member in the lobby who was sitting on a chair in a deep sleep. My walking past didn't even wake him! -Doormen do not open doors for guests consistently. For a 4 star hotel charging $500 a night, I tend to expect this. -Internet access terminals in the lobby are always down. I complained a couple of times and they were fixed, only to be down again. One of the terminals was taken away and not returned for 3 days. There seemed to be no rush to ensure it was fixed. -Concierges are not available all the time. There were times when a concierge was not on the property. One night I wanted a restaurant recommendation at 7pm and went to the concierge desk only to be told that there is no concierge on the property at the moment. -Maids are stingy with replacing toiletries. I had used all the shampoo and on one day when my room was serviced and the toiletries were replaced, my empty shampoo was replaced with a half-empty bottle. I asked the maid whether it had been used by another guest and she said \"I don't know\" and brought a new one. Equally, with the turndown service, they are supposed to provide bottles of Evian for both guests. We had 2 guests, and for most of the nights only 1 bottle of Evian was provided. I wouldn't rush back to the Sofitel at $500 a night, but if you can get a room for under $300 a night it would represent good value.

Arrived in yellow taxi from Newark ($65 i think), and were immediately met and helped out with our luggage. We were able to walk right in and check in without having to haul bags. Arrived at about 1.30pm and got checked in straight away (no problem swaping to a smoking room). We were given a room on floor 29 and when we pulled back the curtains the view was breathtaking. Superb view out to the Chrysler Building and if you strained your neck you could also make out the Empire State Building too. The room was clean and spacious (Not sure where other complaints about the room being too small, maybe we arent used to larger tooms). Plenty of coat hangers and a wonderful bathroom with bath and a very spacious shower (water pressure could have been better though). Bed was wonderfully comfortable. Wasnt expecting to need air conditioning in November but it was great (21deg outside). After changing and heading out we arrived back exhausted later that evening and went straight to bed. It was after i switched off the airconditioning that i noticed an irratting noise from the bathroom area. It seemed to be the extractor fan which was not switching off and unfortunately the noise was such that i spent a very sleepless night! Not a good start to holiday. In the morning i reported to receiption and they said they would check it out. We arrived back later that evening and the noise was still there. Went to reception and they said they would send an engineer round. He arrived about 5 mins later and said he thought he knew what the problem was. We were leaving to go to a show and had to leave him to it. When we arrived back it was late and we were exhausted, the noise was still there and there was a phone message left for me. Basically said that it was a pump above the room which controlled the water and could not be switched off however they would be more than happy to move us to another room. It was too late so i thought i would give it another go. Slept a little better but the noise was still very annoying. I should have moved the next night but again we arrived back late and i didnt want the hassle. Slept with the window open and slept like a log!. The noise in the room seems to switch on and off whereas the background noise from outside was constant and helped to smooth out the sound!. Would reccomend getting the sofitel privelege card for the late check out, and free drinks in the hotel bar. We didnt receive our complimentary chocolates though we did get the evian water delivered every night. On the morning we were checking out i looked up the bill on the tv an noticed that we were being charged the full rate. I had actually been allowed a lower rate on the \"Price Match less 10%\" deal on the Sofitel Website. Luckily I had all the paperwork and copies of emails with me. Took a bit of explanation as it seems that the Hotel did not receive notification that I had been given the lower rate ($500 less) and this created some confusion. Eventually Albert was able to sort out the matter and my bill was duly reduced. Watch out for the minibar-I had lifted out 2 bottles to look at the alcohol content and these showed up on the bill. These were immediately removed when I mentioned it. There is a sensor in the minbar which shows up when anything is removed. Checked out a 4pm and the doorman offered us a yellow taxi for $51+Tip+Tolls or a Limo for $60+Tip+Tolls. We took the limo and had a very comfortable trip to airport. The location of the hotel is superb, just off 5th Avenue, easy walking distance to subway, Broadway, Empire State, Macys, Central Park etc. All in all I would give the Sofitel 5 stars. They made us feel welcome and despite the problem with the noise in the room it was I that chose to stay on when they had offered the change. I would reccomend anyone who avails of the \"price match deal\" to confirm the rate directly with the hotel to prevent any confusion.

Very pleasant stay with no real faults to report but no 'wow' factor either. Not a place you would regret staying at but surprised it gets quite such enthusiastic reviews on this site. We stayed in a King Suite on the 28th floor and the room was very quiet and comfortable.

Nice lobby, decent communal areas and an easy place to relax - it depends what you are looking for, and I would recommend the Sofitel as a good, safe bet. Having stayed at the Four Seasons in Dublin a week or so earlier my girlfriend and I are still commenting to friends on the standard or service etc we received - with the Sofitel our only real comment was that it was 'nice'. Minor complaint was the standard of room cleaning - e.g. marks on the bedside tables caused by water glasses were not wiped away in the 4 days we were there and apart from the bed having been made it was difficult to tell if the room had been serviced. We didn't complain, however, so gave them no chance to rectify it. Location very good particularly for a first time visit to NY.

We have stayed at many fine hotels and this one did not disappoint. It was a great home for us during our visit to NYC. The hotel is nicely tucked away from the crowds but still very close to Times Square, Rocefeller Plaza, Grand Central Station, subway access, etc. The lobby is elegant in an understated way - feels comfortable and approachable. There is a small computer room off the lobby with four computers and a printer with free internet access - this was a big plus! The front desk staff is friendly and efficient - very service oriented - they worked with us to find a room we liked - our first room had a very small window and felt claustrophobic. When we called down to complain the front desk clerk offered to come up and show us another room to see if we liked it better - very accommodating. The front desk is located near the elevators - we were greeted consistently when coming and going. The carpet in the elevators and the guest room corridors were the only things in the hotel that did not feel spotless - they always seemed like they needed to be vacuumed. The room we ended up in was a Deluxe Queen on the 21st floor which had a nice city view. Initially we were not sure about having a queen bed versus a king but it turned out to be a very comfortable room. The bed was fabulous just as others have mentioned in their reviews - felt like a layer of down under the sheet - there were feather pillows - two king size, two standard size - the down comforter and duvay were very cozy - although it was weird that there was no top sheet provided on the bed - we had to request a top sheet every day. All the bedding was very crisp, clean, fresh, high quality. The carpet in the room was soft and comfortable and also felt very clean. The art work was attractive. The bathroom was FABULOUS!! - felt very clean, fresh, updated, luxurious - attractive marble, shiny metal fixtures, separate shower, Frette bath linens, upscale French bath amenities. As others have mentioned the room was VERY QUIET - we did not hear any sirens, city traffic noise, etc while in our room which was very nice! The air conditioning in the room was also very quiet. Also a nice touch to have a Sony CD player/alarm clock - we brought some of our favorite CD's and enjoyed the music while in our room. The housekeepers kept the room clean and fresh twice a day and we never really noticed them - very discreet. Gaby's Restaurant was nice for breakfast - food quality was high, portions were nice - not too much or too little - coffee and orange juice were included in price of breakfast - $21 for American breakfast including 2 eggs, breakfast potatoes, wonderful fresh croissant, breakfast meat, coffee or tee, and juice. They automatically add 15% gratuity to all breakfast checks - that was strange. Anyway, it was a nice experience and worth the $50 for a special breakfast for two (although on day two the hotel was power washing the sidewalk right outside the windows of the restaurant - the noise was disturbing - not sure why they would choose to do that during the morning hours at breakfast time). The french press coffee was a nice touch but they leave the pot on the table and it gets cold too fast. We did enroll in the Sofitel Privilege Program before arriving and were offered a free drink when we checked in (although it was only ONE drink - strange since there were two of us). The concierge was dissapointing when compared with the rest of the experience. We dealt with three different concierge agents during our stay and found all three to be aloof. They did not seem very interested in helping, not very enthusiastic, not service oriented - a bit snobby. The bellmen and door staff also seemed aloof. Overall the hotel was impressive. The facility is modern and clean. The service at the front desk/ restaurant/ housekeeping is very good - the concierge/ bellmen/ door staff need work.

The Sofitel is now our \"Signature Hotel\" for our trips to NYC. We have already booked two more stays this year. BTW, the Red Flame is definitely a must for a very good breakfast.

We based our decision on the reviews from the TA website, and wanted to be close to Times Square. Our flight was delayed 2 hours, and because of Deltas \"Frequent Snorer\" program, sleep was not a possibility on our red-eye. We arrived at JFK at 6:30am, and by the time our cab made it through rush hour, we showed up at the front desk at about 8:00am. My wife (6 months pregnant) was spent. I asked if I could pay a day rate to check in early, and they said the hotel was full that evening. The manager overheard, took one look at my wife, and came over to assist. She found us a room, with a beautiful view of the Chrysler bldg, and offered it at no charge! +1 Sofitel! The room was fine. Very typical size, but very nicely appointed. +2 Sofitel! Delightful bed (we sleep on a tempur-pedic at home) +3, stunning bath room+4. The shower was so good we are now contacting the manf. of the showerhead to have one shipped and retrofitted to ours. +5!!! Location was amazing. So close to TS, but just as easy to the Today show, and then another block or two to 5th Ave shopping. +6 Staff was great from them moment we checked in. Very accomidating, and very personal. Always a smile to greet you even when you are walking by. +7. The lobby is stunning, and in general the decor was A++++, +8 Our flight was late afternoon, and a late checkout was no problem. +8.5 Sofitel !!!! Now the glitches... Yes, we got our bottled water about half the time, and if we were in our room during turndown time, the housekeeper never came back, the doorman was a tad preoccupied, and Gaby's was overpriced. Our stay included free breakfast and we only ate there 2 of our 4 days, even though it was free. The juice is $5/glass, and frankly, for $10, the Red Flame breakfast was better, in our opinion. And true, for some reason, the hallway to our room was toasty, yet our room could feel like the southpole if we had the thermostat set below 70. We kept it on automatic 72 and it was pleasant the whole trip. If you think the hallway is hot, try the ice room by the stairs.. wow! I got a kick out of the room service menu, mostly because a Red Bull is $18. I love NYC for stuff like that! All in all... with all the glitches... -1 Sofitel. No big deal!

The day after having made and paid for my reservations, I was alarmed to read a couple of negative/so-so reviews of the Sofitel. I had chosen this hotel based on previous reviews, and then these appeared. I am delighted to report that our experience was nothing but positive. Our room was large (for New York), clean and comfortable. The beds and pillows were perfect, and the linens clean and fresh. I usually travel with my pillow because I have such difficulty sleeping with hotel pillows, but had forgotten it this time, so the pillow review is especially meaningful. As mentioned in many other reviews, the bathroom was wonderful. In fact, my son liked it so much I had to remind him at one point that we hadn't come to NY to spend a week in the bathroom taking showers. The service from staff was prompt and courteous. When I mentioned to a front desk clerk that my son had loved the chocolates (sign up for the Sofitel privilege card beforehand!) and was disappointed that they weren't going to be delivered nightly, he saw to it that more were sent up that night (at no charge). On our first night there I heard a high-pitched sound coming from the A/C vent, and knowing I wouldn't be able to sleep with that going, I called the front desk to complain. Within 5 minutes a custodian came to the room and quickly fixed it. So much for my hopes of being upgraded to a suite! We did not use the conceriege service, so I cannot comment on that, but whatever service we did need was provided with a smile. The location of the hotel is excellent for access to everything, either by walking, subway, bus, or taxi. For breakfast we liked the nearby Cafe Europa (5th Ave.) and Cafe Manhattan (W. 45th St.). Yes, the hallway outside the elevators on the floor (17th) was not air conditioned, but on the other hand, we never had to wait more than 30 seconds for an elevator. All in all, I think the hotel is a superior choice. It is a 4-star, so those expecting 5-star ameneties may be disappointed, but we definitely were not.

LOCATION: 1/2 block from 5th Ave, 2 1/2 blocks from Grand Central Station, 2 blocks from Broadway. Located in a much more quiet and less traffic street (W. 44th). This is more of a boutique hotel where you can find a quiet, cozy, warm lobby in contrast with the big American hotels. II. CLEANLINESS: Very clean. Nicely, tastefully and artistically decorated from the lobby to the rooms. They change your sheets and comforter so everything is fresh and clean. III. COMFORT: The bed is superb. Nice room size for a NewYork Hotel. The tub and bathroom are surprisingly large. Very impressive furnitures. The amenities in the room are outstanding: you can find q-tips, listerine mint, umbrella, robes, slipper, safety pin, needle and threads, magnified mirror, candles (where applicable)and a scale. My room even had some fresh orchid in a stainless steel vase. The only missing one is a Bible and NO CABLE TV. They even have internet access in the room for $9.99/day but why pay if you can use one of the 3 super fast computers in their business center that includes a printer? IV. SERVICE: This is the best part of the hotel. Customer service was outstanding from replying to your email to checking in/out. My room was upgraded to a suite (without any request) because they know that we were the for a very special occasion. They even delivered a bottle of champagne to our room within 30 minutes of checking in. Housekeeping service is excellent. All requests were handled in a timely and professional manner. I'm a clean freak, so I normally request disinfectant and clean the room, especially bathroom and commode whenever I check in to a hotel. After that, I normally put a \"do not disturb\" sign outside so no one would come in and \"clean\" the room again with the same \"wiper\" they have used in other rooms. I only call for extra towels and shampoo...if needed. This time wasn't an exception. The bad news is, SECURITY knocked on my door after coming back from a long and tired trip and loudly stated that:\"it is the New York Policy that we have to check on you randomly, especially if you have the \"do not disturb\" sign out for too long. It is also hygiene that we are concerned of. We need to come in to clean your room unless you refuse the service. Do you refuse the service?\" V. COST: Reasonably priced comparing to other 4 stars hotels VI. TIPS: 1. FOR THE FOOD: The food at the hotel is expensive but good. The pizza place across the street has great service and very good food (try the linguini with chopped clams in marinara sauce or white sauce for less than $9) The red flames cafe down the street toward 6th Ave doesn't have good service and the food quality is below average to me but at average price. My best choice for something fast, inexpensive, good and healthy is Cafe Europa (walk 1/2 block toward 5th Ave then make a right). Must make a reservation to Club 21 in the evening. Try the better Prefixe (choice of Apetizer, entre and desert) for $68 or spend a little more for the \"Taster\" which includes different wines and foods. Check out (---) for more. Must experience the Bateaux New York Cruise and dinner at night along Hudson River. Want something more romantic on this cruise? Upgrade the package to \"Romance on the river\" and you will be treated like a VIP, the lady will get 1/2 dozen of roses. For more, check (---) 2. FOR THE SHOWS: Don't need to spend big bucks on expedia or online to get \"good seats\". Most of these theaters give you extremely good view of the stage. In fact, I think you will get better view seating upstair. You can save 50% by standing in line at the ticket booths on Broadway (cash only). 3. FOR TRANSPORTATION: a. From and to airport to hotel: If you want to save money then subway is best. If you have at least 2 people in your party then go with the taxi and save you from traveling all over town in a super shuttle. It is only 8-10 dollars more if you have at least 2 people. b. Around town: Best to walk even if it is 15 blocks away. Too much to see and too many people walking, we walked 15 blocks before realizing it. From Sofitel to most destinations would cost you $5.50-12.00 for 2 (Taxi charge: $2.50 starting + 40 cents for each 1/5 mile + 40 cents for each stop that is longer than 2 minutes + $1 for extra person during a certain period of time. Going to Financial District or China Town, the least expensive way is subway ($2-4) 4. FOR THE SHOES: Bring your most comfortable walking shoes or slippers (best with open toes to prevent friction) and some bandages. You are guaranteed to have blisters even with the most comfortable shoes. 5. SOFITEL HOTEL CHOICE: Don't stay at Sofitel if you have kids who need more attraction and kid's amenites.

After reading some of the not-so-hot recent reviews, we were worried. Not to worry...everything was perfect with Sofitel. Before we arrived, we asked for early check-in and a high-floor room. When we arrived at noon, a room on the 22nd floor was waiting for us. However, because there were no Executive King Suites at the time we booked directly with the hotel, we asked if they had any cancellations since our booking and if so, could we upgrade to one from our Premier Queen room. They found a King on the 20th floor that we had to wait for but we didn't mind since it would be free of charge. We later found out that they had moved us without a fuss, even though they had already set up champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries in the first room. The champagne was a nice touch from the hotel and the strawberries were sent from a friend. When we got into our room, we had a nice view to the side of the Chrysler Building and could see part of the top of the Empire State Builidng. The room was nicely decorated, not too modern and none of the furniture was shabby (as one past reviewer mentioned). The room was fairly big for a hotel room in a big city and the carpet looked and felt clean even walking on it barefooted. Strangely though, the room was not a suite even though the bed was a king bed. We had assumed that it would be a suite with it's own sitting room since a past reviewer had mentioned that the only way to get a king bed was to book a suite. I don't think that's the case now. The bed was absolutely comfortable!!! I like firm beds and my husband likes softer beds. For some reason, we BOTH had no problems sleeping in comfort on this bed. The spacious bathroom was extremely clean, with the marble floor so clean that I didn't feel like I had to lay down towels or use slippers while standing bare footed. There is a separate bathtub and a separate shower which is nice since you don't have to step over the side of a tub to get into the shower. The water pressure was adequate and the toiletries they had were nice enough. I would recommend you bring your own hair conditioner if you use it regularly to get out tangles. The hair conditioner they provided never did the trick. The lighting was great in the bathroom, especially with the lights surrounding the entire mirror...great for when you were putting on your make-up or shaving. Unlike a previous reviewer, our air conditioning for the room worked extremely well and was a blessing when we would come back after a day of sightseeing in the heat and humidity. Oddly though, we noticed that the hotel cools the lobby areas nicely but only cooled the hallway of our floor at a minimum. The lobby area was so nicely cooled that you could sit there for hours. Plus, Sofitel provides guests with access to three computers and a printer 24 hours a day in their lobby. This was wonderful for getting Broadway tickets at the last minute (sign up for free membership to Playbill and you'll get discounts or check Craigslist for last minute tickets) and for checking in and printing out your airline boarding pass the night before you depart. For the $289 a night we paid, we were extremely happy with Sofitel. We've stayed in much worse for the price. The hotel is in great shape and it truly is within walking distance to everything...2 blocks to Time Square and the theaters and 3 blocks the opposite direction to Grand Central Station where you can take the subway to all tourist areas. It's even easier to hail a cab from Sofitel than say if you stayed at a busier hotel in or closer to Time Square where you have to compete with others for a taxi at busy commute times. P.S. Try to get Broadway tickets to Spamalot...it was costly but SOOO worth it. Also, do NOT buy the \"New York City Pass\" which offers admission for several museums and attractions for one price for a set number of days. We barely recovered the money we spent for the passes because you just couldn't do too much with the lines and the crowds. The pass claims that you get to bypass the ticket lines at some of the attractions. True, you don't have to wait in the TICKET lines at some places but you will have to wait in the line for those people like you who purchased the pass. These lines were almost as long as the ticket lines! For example, we could have used the computer kiosks (no lines) for purchasing admission tickets at the Museum of Natural History but since it was covered in our pass, we waited in a long line. And at the Empire State Building, we had to wait in line with everyone who was buying tickets. If we didn't have the pass, we could have spent a little more money and purchased \"Express\" tickets that allowed you to bypass all the lines or move to the front of the lines (i.e., security check).", "Date": "July 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cFine Hotel\u201d", "Author": "DonnaMark", "ReviewID": "UR3694730", "Content": "First time visitors to NYC for a romantic fling, my wife and I booked the Sofitel based on reviews from this site.

Unlike a previous reviewer, we did receive acknowledgement and some special treatment, with an upgrade to a suite on a high floor. We were staying on a Saturday night, however, and it's likely there was plenty of availability. The hotel has elegant and sleek public spaces, with a very nice lobby and front desk area. It certainly has a European/French feel to it, with French TV channels and everything written in both English and French. Our suite was well-apportioned, with terrific fixtures, including an incredibly cozy and handsome bed, and gorgeous bathroom and shower area. Otherwise, I'd call the rest of the room understatedly elegant and modern, with handsome fixtures all around. I like the location in that it isn't in the heart of Times Square, but was an easy walk to it, and is also convenient to the Theater District. Because the hotel is further east of both of those areas, it's got a touch less hustle and bustle, and just feels like a less touristed area. Don't get me wrong - it's still midtown New York City, but being a few blocks east of those other areas make it a more relaxed setting. Plus, catching a taxi down Fifth is an easy shot to Greenwich Village which, given the NYC traffic patterns, is nice. Because I live in NYC, I don't stay in New York hotels much, it's hard to compare the Sofitel to the nicer hotels here. But relative to the upscale business hotels I normally stay in in other cities, this is really a lovely hotel, and I do recommend it.

Though not the hotel's fault, consideration would have been nice. I asked if there were any rooms with views, but we were given a room on the 21st floor overlooking 44st Street (no real view). I don't know if they had control over that, but I didn't feel that they put in any special effort, given the fact that we told them months in advance when we reserved that it was an anniversary. Maybe it is too large a hotel for that kind of attention to detail, as I've seen in smaller hotels. The concierge was very helpful, as was the doorman who hailed a cab for us in the rain. After our dinner, we walked back to the hotel from the Village, which was fun. Sunday morning, the Puerto Rican parade originated in front of the hotel. It was interesting to see the floats up close, and we didn't have trouble leaving the city that afternoon (as I expected when I saw the crowds!) The Red Flame diner was a quick and inexpensive breakfast. We had an easy walk up to MoMA. We signed up for the privilege card and took advantage of the late check out which was very convenient. That alone makes it worthwhile. No one mentioned a free drink at the bar, so we didn't take advantage of that. I had obtained a good rate through a Playbill offer, but when I went to check out, I was charged the wrong rate. After some time they corrected it, but did not apologize.

They are truly beatiful, with a seperate glassed in shower, marble floors and granite counter tops. Hiltons bath is very average with a shower curtain over the tub (ick!). Hiltons shower control had 2 inch in red and blue that say HOT COLD. Its very tacky/ institutional. Towels in the Sofitel are thick and absorbant. You can also lounge around in the provided robe and slippers. Towels are nice at the hiton but not as thick, no robe, no slippers. Bath Products in the Sofitel are Roger et Gallet.

Good accomodation is something I place great importance on - it's great to just crash out sometimes and watch a movie for a few hours - the Sofitel surpassed this expectation in every measurable sense. Rooms are absolutely luxurious - they look identical to the pictures on their site (something that's very rare these days). Attention to detail is extraordinary; mini Hi-fi, CD clock radio, travel adapter in room, bathrobes, slippers, candle in bathroom (along a little box with a nail file, shower cap and some mints), separate shower, silk coat hangers; there was even an umbrella provided in the closet. Location is perfect - 5th Ave (including Met Life building) on one side; Times Square is a few blocks away on the other, but it's still in a very quiet spot. The room was totally soundproof; I never heard any street noise, and couldn't even tell if there was anyone in the room next to me - it's the first hotel I've stayed in for a long time where I've had a proper nights sleep. Staff go out of their way to help their guests - nothing is too much trouble. Just to give an idea of the high quality service - on the first night, there was some ambient noise from the air conditioning in the room. When I asked to change rooms the following morning, the receptionist brought to a suite that had an even better view of the Empire State building. When transferring the bags to the new room, he not only insisted on carrying both (heavy) bags, but would not accept a tip for the trouble - that truly is first class service.

I recommend breakfast each day 3 doors down at The Red Flame diner - cheap but nice and not rushed. We didn't use the hotel restaurant for eating, though we had a couple of night cap cocktails that were nice and not overly expensive (I do recommend the 8th floor lounge at the Marriott on Times Sq for cocktails and Tapas).

(Jan 14-18 2005) As it states in all the other reviews, the staff are brilliant. From the point of arriving to leaving they went the extra mile and were always helpfull, especially the concierge who booked us tables for dinner and advised us on almost everything about New York. The room was very nice and was cleaned twice a day, which meant if you had an afternoon nap, the bed was remade when you got back at night! As promised there were bottles of water and flowers beside the bed each night. It may not sound like much, but it stops you breaking into the min-bar to have a drink, and saves you a few bucks! The bathroom was very large with a bath and very big shower. There were speakers in the bathoom, behind the mirror, so you could listen to the music/tv that was on, and a fluffy dressing gown to name but a few niceties... Our room was on the 19th floor, and the view was of W44th street. Not a great view, however I was realistic to expect that when you stay in the city you may see buildings out of your window. They were not however slap bang outside, and therefore allowed normal light etc into the room. It was no different to staying at many of the hotels I have stayed in in London, Paris etc (I stayed at the Millenium broadway last year, which is the hotel down the road, and although the view was of broadway and was much nicer, the room and staff do not compare.) We ordered room service on two nights, and both times the food was of a high quality and delivered quickly. The person taking the order was also very helpful and friendly, (As opposed to Millenium Broadway, where I felt I was taking a liberty ordering room service!) I can't stress enough how much the staff made the stay a pleasure, combined with the excellent facilities and decor of the hotel. I read a few of the reviews on this site, where people scored it lower as it is not as good as a 5 star hotel. Well all I would say is that this is the best 4 star hotel I have ever stayed in. Its a general rule that you get what you pay for, so if you pay more, then a 5 star will give you more. However I can't think of what else they could do, expept move the building onto broadway. This hotel is exceptional value for money, and we will be staying there again. (P.S. Red flame diner is the most friendliest and best in the locality. We strayed to another because the queue was so big one morning. Big mistake.

On arrival we were allocated a room on the 12th floor but made enquiries as to whether we could be moved to a room with a better view. We were offered a room on the 23rd floor and it had a view of the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings for no extra cost, so it's definitely worth asking!

Central Park was about 30-40 mins walk away. Although very pleased with the hotel itself, there were a couple of things that let us down personally. The first was some information requested from our concierge. We had asked him to confirm our return flight details on the day of departure and were wrongly advised as to which terminal we needed to get to and the second was that despite informing reception at check-in that we wished to make use of the 4pm check-out, we received 2 visits from staff while we were packing asking us when we were due to leave the room as they had no record of our request. Also, one word of advice on taxis - there is currently a flat-rate fee of $45 + toll ($4) and tip from JFK to midtown Mahattan but this does not apply to the return trip!

At the Sofitel, I was on the 24th floor, with a nice view of the skyline. At the Algonquin, there was a miniscule bathroom with a combination tub, shower. At the Sofitel, I had a huge, beautiful bathroom with separate shower and tub, lots of counter space, nice French toiletries and a makeup mirror. At the Alongquin, there were two tiny elevators that you had to wait forever for. At the Sofitel, there were four huge elevators that came immediately.

I thought it was great. I didn't even know they had turndown service (they certainly didn't at the Alongquin) and I left clothes strewn on my bed - when I came back at night, the clothes were all neatly folded, my bed turned down, the curtains closed, a bottle of Evian on the nightstand, together with the next day's weather forecast. Lovely! The staff also couldn't have been nicer or more helpful, with no attitude (unlike at some of the more trendy hotels in NYC). Perhaps the thing I liked the best at the Sofitel was that it was dead quiet. I heard no street noise whatsoever, nor any noise from any of the other rooms. I also loved the fact that the curtains completely blocked out the light at night (at the Algonquin, they had these strange blinds that did not completely darken the room). Someone else on this site complained that at the Sofitel your morning wake-up call is not from a live person (it's just a ring on the phone). As for me, I don't care about chatting with a live operator for my morning wake-up call - what I value is quiet and a spacious, attractively furnished room and I got that at the Sofitel for a very reasonable price. I'll be back. P.S. My only quibble with the Sofitel was the bar (I didn't try the restaurant).

The location is very central & every member of staff we came accross was polite and friendly. On one occasion we couldn't lock our door and it was put right the instant we reported it - I've never had such quick service!

Its your own personal guide, who'll tell you everything and even all the triva bits like what movies were in the park and what not.

Also, we required a late check out before getting the shuttle pick-up for our flight. They made no problem about it (another advantage of the Sofitel card: it DOES give something to the customer, while Hilton is just flattering egos by giving Gold or Diamond cards, which give nothing to their customers). The only downside is that I would recommend to carefully heck your bill: we had an Internet Special rate, which was not considered at first, and they charged us a much higher price.

New York is probably the most friendly and exciting city in the world and this hotel contibuted in no small part to a wonderful experience. If you want to do museums galleries and shops , walk the town from end to end and sample the nighlife you can't do so unless you have a good comfortable base to return to. This is in our opinion is it.

All reviews were accurate and the hotel was certainly above average with helpful staff and modern, clean and roomy surroundings. The location of the hotel was perfect - 2min to the left Times Square and 2min to the right 5th Ave. The room was a decent size with large bathroom but had no view other than fire escapes. Negatives were that we could hear whenever the room next door was running water and there were a lot of door slams. There is a great cafe type place the Red (lobster or flame?) almost next door which is excellent value for breakfasts. Directly adjacent is where the 'worlds most expensive hamburger' is served. One other point is there is a good bar on the same street - St Andrews, if you need to take a break from it. One word of warning is that if you book online directly with the hotel it is does not include tax which will add a significant amount to your bill. Overall a good Marriot type hotel, nothing hugely special but almost nothing to complain about.", "Date": "April 28, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed our stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1803013", "Content": "Myself and my husband spent 5 nights here over Easter.

The location is perfect for exploring the immediate area and is just 5 mins from the subway to get you out to the rest of the city. The rooms are average size and perfectly adequate for two people.

The bathrooms offer a greater degree of style with vases of orchids and candles adding the extra touches which make all the difference.

But this time I wanted a location a bit further south. I was supposed to have a view of the Chrysler or Empire State buildings, and was told by the desk clerk that the view of the Chrysler is particularly beautiful at night. Well, they must have moved it - our room looked out to a non-descript dreary office building across the street, even though we were on the 18th floor. I could of complained I guess, but I don't go on vacation to argue with desk clerks. The room decor was not in the least interesting, my wife said \"glorified Holiday Inn\" upon walking in. It was pretty bland. The staff was friendly and professional, and the soundproofing was great - very quiet for NYC.

Even though check-in was not until the afternoon, when we arrived at 10am we were delighted to find that out that our room was ready and could check in early. First off, let me tell you that this hotel was flat out GEORGOUS. From the sophisticated lobby with marble floor and leather chairs to the glowing candles on every table and the soothing potpurri aroma, we fell in love with the ambiance of this place. Our room was on the 19th floor, and my lord, what a fantastic view of rockafeller center (GE Building). Even though the room was a little smaller than previous hotels i had stayed at in NYC, the overall quality of the room and the view MORE than made up for the size. Everything in the room looked brand new. Even the marble bathroom was in pristine condition. The beds were comfy, slippers and shower robe were provided. Extra pillows and blanket were also already provided in the closet. Location, Location, Location. I dont think this hotel could be in any more of a perfect location (especially when its 15 degrees out). We were literally 1.5 blocks east of Times Square, 0.5 blocks west of 5th Avenue, 5 blocks south of Rockefeller center. EVERYTHING was literally within a 5 minute walk. We couldnt have asked for a better location. To sum it up, this is by far one of the greatest hotels we have ever stayed in. We couldnt have had a more perfect valentines day and a more fantastic trip to NYC. After hours of research on this site and many others, i dont think we could have made a better choice. Last year when i was in the city i stayed at the Rhiga Royal, and while the rooms were huge, i was unimpressed with the lobby, the location, and the view from the room. The sofitel on the other hand was much more agreeable and to my liking. I will be staying at this hotel everytime we go back to the city, it was just amazing. PROS: + Beautiful Lobby + Beautiful Rooms + Extremely Friendly Staff (most seemed to be from France) + Location was superb + Clean Rooms/Bathroom/Lobby + View was fantastic (we were in room 1904 if anyone was curious) CONS: - To be honest, there is none i can think of.

The real selling point is the closeness to everything - Times Square one way in less than 5 mins, 5th Avenue 2 mins, Empire State less than 10 mins walk, Central Park in 10 mins.Only thing that made me laugh was the New York born and bred doormen with their daily \"Bonjour\" (think Del boy and u get the picture!!) - but then the chain is French.Ate in Gabys once (the in hotel restaurant) which was good but you need to like French cuisine and if you don't, well, alternative venues aren't far!Was able to check in at 11am AND check out at 4pm with no charge (but do ask early)Bad points? Only the mini-bar I guess - $5 for a can of coke is pretty extortionate, but it's a pretty minor complaint when there are so many places to get snacks around.
