On this particular visit I wanted it to run smoothly because it was a surprise for my boyfriend's 30th and I love the location and shops onsite. I emailed several times to confirm and requested early check in ahead of time. Reservations advised that they could not guarantee early check in and that I could not book an additional night as the booking was made through Travelocity. I took my chances and turned up hoping to get in early. We arrived and were assigned a room upon arrival. No-one offered to assist with luggage to our rooms, so we hauled them across the entire hotel til we reached our room. Once we reached the room, it was already occupied and was due to be vacated by the couple as the view was of a roof (giving me a view of a roof even though I had told them it was for a surprise 30th is quite poor on service but I understand views cannot be guaranteed). I called down to Reception who moved me to another room which they did, I waited over 20 minutes for Security to be sent up to open the door for me. No keys to the room were sent up with Security, we waited an additional hour (freshened up in this time) and I then called down to ask when our keys would be delivered, we then waited at least another 30 minutes to receive these. The Forum Tower Room was neat, but in need of attention, tv stand needed repainting and the surface was dusty, never mind, we're in Vegas. The hairdryer provided in the room blew up and it took quite some time to receive another one delaying us in reaching our dinner reservation. WI-FI- $14.99 per person for wifi access in your ROOM ONLY. If you want wifi on the entire property its $24.99, when I asked if my partner and I could both use the one wifi, I was advised that was not an option and we would have to pay for two separate accounts. Ridiculous! Upon checking out, I gave this feedback nicely to the Receptionist and asked that some of the items on the bill be waived (there were also items on the bill for which we were billed and did not use), we had 3 days of the wifi waived and were still charged for 2 days. She seemed to show little care about my experience even though I had explained that this was my third visit, I would of expected a few kind words to apologise for any inconveniences, but instead a blank \"I dont care\" expression and that was it.

Again, I was offered an upgrade to a room with jacuzzi in the Palace Tower; but declined due to my preference for the Forum Tower location within Caesars Palace (across from The Colosium, proximity to self parking elevators, Cypress Market, sports book area, Appian Way corridor to Palace Casino area of hotel, etc). Last stay, I had a west facing room on floor 58; this stay, I had an east facing room on floor 69. The elevator ride to floor 69 was noticably longer than the one to floor 58, but it wasn't something that was a negative. Just as I did last November, I really enjoyed my stay at Caesars Palace. However, after this stay, the fact that the beds in Caesars Palace feel really good stayed with me after I got back home and I wanted to know what made those beds feel sooo good. Turns out one of the reasons for the luxurious feel of the beds is Anachini linens on pillow top beds and down pillows. I was told by a co-worker after getting back that these are available for purchase in the Caesars store on the main floor. Just as an additional note, there will be a Nobu restaurant and boutique hotel opening within Caesars later this year (it will be replace the Centurion Tower).

Our cab driver to the hotel charged us double the going rate (we found this out later) and this set the stage for our vacation in Vegas, which just happened to be our 25th Anniversary( we were @ Ceasars 7 nights). It took an hour to check in (there were 2 lines-4 others were sitting behind the registration desk chatting about how busy it was going to be next month) we get to our turn and sigh the room booked (non-smoking King) is not available but they upgraded us to a smoking optional room with double beds in the Augustus tower 23rd floor rm2384\u2026.this is an upgrade? And to add insult to it all they neglected to inform us that we were on the 23rd floor on the PET FRIENDLY floor. Room was appeared nice \u2026. Found hair in the tub long black and I have short blonde hair def not mine and only one set of towels , thin walls got to listen to dogs whine, bark and the comings and goings of their owners @ 4am and then there is that particular smell\u2026.(and yes we are dog lovers). Beds were horrible, bad enough we were now in a double bed when we booked a KING but the bed was lumpy, feather pillows (my husband is allergic to them) had feathers coming through and the comforter that looked so good was scratchy. Coffee maker was in room (was only going to cost $12 a day as it was a pod coffee maker) fridge was in room fully stocked so you couldn\u2019t put your own drink it to keep it cold, there was a charge for internet and what channels we did receive on the TV would cut in and out and change on there own???

We did check out our friends accommodations at the Flamingo and it appears that this hotel would have been a better bet as the room was spotless, had a wonderful area to sit to have coffee beginning of the day or end of a long day and they seems to have more staff on hand. Long story short the hotel fell well below our expectations and we really did not know what to expect this being our first trip we feel the hotel would be ok if you are a hard core gambler and did not expect much for amenities, comfort or if you are looking for a place for the night. Would not recommend for a special occasion it just did not measure up and it didn\u2019t appear that the staff were up to date on things going on in the hotel and did not seem to either care or perhaps they were too short staffed (like I said we could not locate anyone to talk to on phone and the desks were lined up) we just wished we had tried it before booking for our anniversary.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Camino, California", "Title": "\u201cMy first time here\u201d", "Author": "firedawg007", "ReviewID": "UR128447507", "Content": "I would like to say that I had not stayed on the main strip before as I usually stay down on freemont street.

Pros: 1. We stayed in the Octavius Tower which was breathtaking. 2. The staff was professional, helpful & top notch Cons: 1.There is NO room at the pools. There are SIX pools! There is a line that forms at 8:30am & you litterally have to run to snag a chair. The worst part is that they allow you as many towels as you like so people were lining up chairs with towels for thier friends who didnt arrive at the pool until noon which is incredibly inconsiderate. 2. We put our name on the list to get into Pure Nightclub at 3pm & we were assured that we would not have to pay a cover charge because we were staying at Ceasars. I asked about the music selection & was assured it was my taste. We arrived at 11pm to find a huge crowd of people waiting to get in. They were all jumbled together so there was no clear \"line\". We were told to go to 2 different lines by 2 different bouncers. We stood in line for 30 minutes before being let in AND were charged a $60 cover charge which was supposed to be free by showing our room key. This club is way too overhyped & marketed as the exclusive high-end hotspot & it is not. The music was lame. There was a long line at the bar & bathroom. There was also no room on the dancefloor, not that I cared to dance to the crappy pop music that they were playing. 3. The food was not very good & way overpriced. We ate all meals elsewhere after the 1st day. My Advice: If you want a fun day at the pool, get there early. The right hand side has the best sun exposure. Dont waste your time or money at Pure. We had a blast a the Palms. You spend $20 & get into Ghostbar on the roof overlooking the strip. It also has exceptional music with lots of old school jams & it a great lounge spot. That $20 also gets you into the Playboy Club which was superfun to dance at. Our favorite restaurant was The Eiffel Tower restaurant which boasts breathtaking views of the Bellagio fountain show. You can ride to the top (which is 1/2 size of the real Eiffel Tower in Paris) for an additional $10 to enjoy a panoramac view of the strip & mountains beyond.

My wife and I travelled to Vegas for a couples weekend and Caesars was one of a handful of hotel there I had not stayed at. Thinking my wife would enjoy the shops I booked the trip. The first day by the pool we watched the wait staff break up a fight between some sixty something's that were drunk in the middle of the day and pissed off when they came back to the pool to find someone else in their lounge chair. The wait staff did fine and told security about it when they came by hours later to document the incident. I won't elaborate about the hour plus waits for food at the pool side snack shop not the absence of wait staff to bring over priced drinks. The absolute kicker was the staff failure to help a passed out cop. I men drunk. At 3 AM my wife and I woke to what I thought was someone playing basket ball in the hall. When I went to look out the door peep hole it was just intime to witness a drunk on the hall floor in front of my room throw up. Nice. I called the front desk who patched me throught to security and we tried to talk to the guy to make sure he was OK. 30 minutes later he is still in the hall and now dry heaving. Again this is nice (sarcasm). I called the front desk again and asked for security and for someone to come clean up the vomit in front of my room. A security officer eventually made it up and got the ID from the guy (still laying on his side) on,y to find out he was a sheriff on vacation. The officer verified who he as and let him into his room, right across from ours. About 8:30 we left for breakfast only to see the vomit was still not cleaned up. I'll spare the details but it needed to be addressed and this time it was. But to get it cleaned up it took 3 employees to not give enough of a care to address it (Cameron at the front desk, the security operator and the security officer that got the drunk into his room).

Ended up sitting on ground next to pool, and we were not the only ones who had to do that. But there were plenty of the pay-to-lay bed-size lounge beds that you have to rent. Guess management figures they'd rather rent out some of those than provide enough chairs for guests. And the regular lounge chairs are crammed side by side with no space in between. OK, next day, go to the fitness center (which I love), then mosey over to pool. Knew it was a risk to not go there first thing in the morning, but still got there around maybe 11:30 and, sure enough, there were no more chairs and we ended up sitting poolside again. Kind of ridiculous. They really need to add more chairs or subtract some of the rental beds/cabanas. Love, love, love the spa - it's so relaxing and pure escape. The slots were very tight.

I'm almost tempted to say that I`m glad I had trouble. The consolation was that good! And it wasn`t even their fault. Now on to the bit about the trouble. If you book through Orbitz, and your arrival is delayed, even if you try to notify the hotel by phone, all you`ll get told is that you have to contact Orbitz. And they don`t seem to care, one way or another. Even after finally arriving, all Orbitz would do about the problem was to offer us an extra night for about $250. Our front desk clerk had already offered us a SIGNIFICANTLY UPGRADED room for $175. I`ll cut to the chase, here. If you want to think you`re getting the best deal, go Orbitz. If you actually want the best deal, forget them. By the way, as a further example, the round trip airport to resort shuttle price through Orbitz was $4.00 more expensive than it would have been had we just gotten on at the airport and paid the posted rate. If you think we`ll bother campaigning for a rebate from Orbitz, after what we went through at the front desk, give your head a shake. I would block their e-mails, but in some way I like to think I`m wasting their resources by just deleting them. In the meantime, the upgrade was so fantastic, that we`re definetly going back. There`s just nothing else like it, that I`m aware of. For another example, when it became apparent that our attempts to deal with the problem via telephone to Orbitz wasn`t going to be a smooth operation, ( both the desk clerk and my wife tried to resolve the situation on the phone, and neither could get any satisfaction), they put a security guard behind us, who politely guided any subsequent guests to another line, so we were never made to feel like we were keeping anybody waiting.

We heard that Caesars had gone thru an exstensive renovation and we wanted to give it a try. We also enjoy the European pools that Las Vegas hotels offer and we wanted to try the Venus Pool at the hotel. When I called to make a reservation I specifically asked if the Venus Pool was open and I was assured that it was and I made our reservation. It also states on their website that it was open. So I felt comfortable that we would be able to enjoy that part of the hotel.......BOY WAS I WRONG!!! The weather the week we were there was in the mid eighties and beautiful. So when we walked down to the pool we were told by several of the people that work there that the Venus Pool would not be open for several more weeeks and there was nothing they could do. One employee even suggested that they tell people it is open only to get them to make a reservation because once you are there you are not going to leave. In addition at the normal pool if you wanted a lounge chair you had to get up at the crack of dawn to find one available and if you came down any time after that you had to pay $150 for a elevated lounge chair with a $50 min. on food and drink.

The second room was just okay ( parking lot view) and the air smelled stale and slightly smoky.

We were offered an upgrade to a Bellagio Fountain facing room for an extra $30 a night - but settled for our room which overlooked the city and Stratosphere end of The Strip. Massive room with comfortable bed, clean roomy bathroom with shower & spa bath. The Casino itself was really nice, with attentive drink staff. The Forum Shops were mind blowing. Great feed had at the Cheesecake Factory within the Shops. Great location along the Strip.

But we were here for Rod Stewart and after doing some research, wanted to stay in the Forum Tower. Now, this is not an upgrade from the Augustus, it is a down grade. But the forum tower has no baths, just showers. We really wanted this tower because you come out of elevators right into the casino and to the left is the food court and to the left of that is the forum shops. Straight ahead out of the elevators is the colesseum. We were there to gamble, eat, shop and see Rod. But no bath? Only the suites....hence my $40 tip. After hearing we were being bumped, and I said we would go back to The Mirage, the clerk managed to get us a room in the forum tower....not a suite, but a room. Hmmmm, what to do? Handed him $20 and said thanks I will go without a tub. Missed it but the room was perfect for us location wise. Nice room too...very clean. Staff were great throughout . Great cocktail service(which is more than can say for the Mirage).Slots were extremely tight(which is consistant for all Harrah's casinos!) Even though the $25 and up blackjack tables are all smoking, I had a dealer complain about the smoke and ask to turn and blow it away from her....we moved to another table and made sure I told the pit boss why. Other dealers were super nice...but hot the night we played. Never made a dime and the desk clerk even told us how much money we dropped when we checked out based on our comps. Hopefully after this visit, next time we will have no problem getting a suite or have to worry about being bumped! Rod Stewart was awesome, the food court was good, Central Cafe was really good(pricey), and Rao's was just ok for the money it cost it should have been super.

The only negatives I can say about the stay here was when we checked in we found the carpet had crumbs all over near the bed and couch, obviously missed by housekeeping. The windows were so water spotted that it showed up in our pictures. Finally, after our checkin around 2PM we wanted to catch a quick cat nap and about 20 mins after we laid down their was a knock at the door- housekeep wanted to fill the mini bar....ummmm shouldn't you do that before we checkin?! He apologized for interrupting our nap- it took him a few mins to inventory the whole mini bar and then scolded us for not having our \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door...Really?! Pool area was beautiful, the name Garden Of The Gods is very fitting. We went down one afternoon just to lay in the sun and they had just removed the \"RESERVED\" signs on the blue mattresses around the pool and we cozied up and enjoyed the last hour or 2 of sunshine for the day. The casino was busy, and not very generous to us, but overall I think it was one of the most appealing casinos to play in. Had a very nice floor attendant at 2AM notice that my players club card wasn't registering in the machine I was playing. I knew it was demagnetized earlier, but the Reward desk was closed but this attendant went out of her way to reprint me not one but 2 cards right then and there! Above & beyond in my opinion.

I stayed in the recently opened Octavius Tower at Caesars Palace for 5 nights last month in a luxury King room . The rate was pretty good and averaged under $200 per night including taxes. One benefit of the Octavius tower is you can use the exclusive Augustus VIP entrance and registration, which meant no queues at checkin or checkout. The Octavius tower room was huge and the in room technology was impressive and not too over the top. I think I got lost in the room at least once. The bed was very big and comfortable with massive pillows & cushions, there was an in room safe, large closet and mini bar. My room had floor to ceiling windows with a spectacular view of the garden of the gods pool area. There was no coffee machine in the room and there was a $25 charge to have it delivered & another \u20ac12 for coffee, so I declined. All in all the room was modern, clean, new, nice, bright and big. The large marble tiled bathroom had dual sinks, large jacuzzi bathtub(try it !!), a separate glass shower cubicle with oversized shower head. Very impressive. It is a long walk from the Octavius rooms to the casino floor or strip so you might want to consider the Augustus or another tower if walking longish distances presents a challenge for you. I tried a couple of the dining options at Ceasars (Bejing Noodle No 9), Raos , Central by Michel Richard, Payard Express, Joes Stone Crab & Seafood Restaurant(Forum Shops), and Java coast coffee at the Cypress Street market place. I had no complaints about any of these and would recommend Joes Stone Crab in particular for the excellent service and food quality. The buffet is currently under renovation at Caesars Palace. The casino floor is big and took a while to get used to the layout. It has all the usual table games, poker machines& slot machines, so theres something there to cater for everyone, whatever your budget is.

Hotel is massive (4000+ rooms) and very busy day and night. Probably the only hotel in Las Vegas that doesn't have a buffet breakfast! Plenty of restaurants but very busy and long queues for most. Even Starbucks was queued all day. Wi-Fi / Wired internet was very expensive at $15 per device/day in the room and $25 per day/device to use throughout the hotel. Everything costs money to do from the \"touch anything in the minibar and the charge is automatic\" through the $12 to use the in-room coffee maker. Never been in a hotel anywhere in the world that charges money to use the in-room coffee making facilities. Given that Caesars Palace isn't inexpensive, charging for this seems over greedy.

Completely outrageous! While it is a lovely casino and I had a beautiful room but I will not be staying and or playing at any Caesars properties in the future. If you stay here be prepared as they are going to place significant holds on your credit card which take about 10-days to come off after they release them (after check out). They will also bill you for any charges on top of the holds placed. This was annoying but not a huge issue.

So after I set for about 5 minutes - I go to the host and complain, she walked right over and told him about it and of course he had an attitude - he was like \"you should have waved me down\"; I told him you totally ignored me - that is your job to attend to all the people not just some! I proceed to place my order, now I wait and the other bar tender takes over because the first one was just a jerk.

What's that?\" may not be the motto of Caesar's Palace, but it sure seems to be the guiding principle. Nothing is too gaudy or grandiose for the place, which was apparently built to resemble what the owners thought the ruler of ancient Rome would have built if he'd had (1) absolute power, (2) unlimited wealth, (3) lots of slave labor, and (4) no concept of subtlety whatsoever. I was there recently for a meeting that lasted several days. For me, the negatives outweighed the positives. In no particular order, the negatives for me were: 1) The place is huge, which is great for conveying a sense of grandeur, etc., but makes it really hard to get quickly from one place to another quickly. It's also not very logically laid out (at least from an ease-of-movement viewpoint) and meeting rooms were not well labeled, although the group I was with could have done a better job on that also. 2) Everything is about twice as expensive as you'd expect. 3) All roads lead to a casino. Seriously, I'm not sure it's even possible to exit the place without going through a casino. It may have been, but I never learned how. 4) You'd better like noise, because there's a lot of it everywhere except in your hotel room. 5) You'd better like to breathe in smoke, especially cigar smoke, because there's a lot of that too. 6) You'd better have a lot of patience, because you're going to need it. One night, my room keycard wouldn't work. I was very tired from walking around the Strip, and it was about a 10-15 minute walk from my room to the front desk (I'm telling you, the place is big!), so I called to see if they could send someone up with a new key. 40 minutes and another call later, someone finally came. Another night, I went to a Caesar's restaurant for dinner with four friends. We got there early so we got right in. But start to finish for dinner was more than two hours, including 25 minutes waiting for the checks to arrive. 7) In more than 30 years of going to hotels, I had never been denied a request for a one-hour late checkout, until Caesar's did just that. They said it was because of their incoming customers that day, but the message it conveyed to me was \"Now that we have your money, we don't give a fig about your convenience.\" There were some good parts too: 1) My hotel room, which was in the Palace Tower, was spacious, clean, and comfortable. The bathroom in particular was big and luxurious. 2) The staff were courteous without fail. They obviously are well-drilled, which can lead to inappropriate responses. When you've just turned down a guest's request for a one-hour delay in checkout, don't then ask what else you can do for him. You haven't done anything for him yet -- at least, anything he wants done. 3) The hotel room, unlike any other part of the complex, was quiet. 4) The people-watching was terrific. Overall, though, I won't be in a hurry to return. The whole experience made me wonder if, instead of his political opponents, Caesar was actually done in by his guests? :)", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cTwice the charm...\u201d", "Author": "travelduchess25", "ReviewID": "UR126714225", "Content": "This is the second visit to Caesars Palace this month, and I cant think of a better place to stay , first visit we stayed in the Forum Tower, beautiful modern room, most comfortable beds ever, my only complaint about this stay was there was no bath only a HUGE shower stall, the tv built into the mirror was a nice touch, also only one pool was open, second stay, a week later, was at the new Octavius Tower, beautiful BIG room, with a couch, table , chairs, and a great view of the pools ,all were open by this time, but construction going on for the hot tubs, We had a few problems with this room, and I cannot mention enough, how the staff and management helped us out, they are just the friendliest and most understanding people I have ever met, and because of this I will only stay at Caesars Palace for all our future trips to LV, we have stayed at the Aria, and the BEllagio...., also, staying at this tower, gave us separate check-in entrance, avoiding the VERY LONG line-up that I witnessed at the main registration area, boy, if there is one are they have to fix, it would be that, as I would have hated to stand in that line, I believe there were quite a few conventions that week, there is a great atmosphere in the casino area,and I did not find it to be as smoky as the other casinos, there is a fantastic shopping centre, with a mixture of high end and middle end shops, restuarants plenty of, we ate at Spago;s, EXCELLENT, and Rao;s, also very good.

The thermostat was digital and I could not figure out how the heck to lower it (no, I'm not a moron, please believe, this thing required a NASA engineer to get it figured out. It was like Darth Vader's chest buttons). Then the toilet handle was not working so unable to flush. Called reception and someone fixed it while I went out for drinks. As suggested by other reviewers, I brought those K-Cup coffee things (so I didn't have to pay $12 for four cups of coffee), only to discover the next morning that the coffee maker was broken. Ah well, did find a express line for getting coffee at a small pastry/coffee place near the Palace Tower. The pools are really nice, and there are comfy lounge chairs and beds to relax on. Before streching out on one of the lounge chairs, I went straight to an outdoor bar near one of the pools to grab a drink. Super sized mojitos are always a good thing!. Didn't try any of the restaurants at Caesar's. I do however recommend the Oyster Bar at Harrah's. If you get a chance to be here before the end of April, check out O'Shea's across the street from Caesar's. Cheap drink prices, and Vince Neil Ink tattoo shop. O'Shea's will be closed at the end of April, and will be completely torn down at some point. I've stayed at The Mirage and Aria in the past two or so years. Out of The Mirage, Caesar's and Aria, I liked Aria the best in terms of room quality and the swimming pools with great cocktail service. All in all, Caesar's was OK.

We know what to expect out of these places. Last week we stayed at Caesars Palace as part of the Pure Romance National Convention. Check-in lines were about 40 minutes long and nobody was even allowed to try to check in until 1:00 PM. We got a 1-king room on the 8th floor of the Roman Tower. We ended up having a number of people hang out in our room, as all of the double queens were not ready. Pure Romance meetings began at 5:30, and many correspondents were not able to even get into their rooms by then, much less be dressed and ready. Our room was quite spacious, only the suites at the Rio compared to square footage in the places we have stayed. The bathroom was tiny, however did have a television in the sink area. Our tub did not drain properly--it would take 15-20 minutes to drain all the water out after a shower. The convention took place mostly in (I believe) the Octavian Room, and it was a wonderful, large setting. Drink service on the casino floor was quite slow, except for one Asian waitress who would come back with drinks for us even before we had ordered them. We gave her a few bucks extra, and she would come back with two at a time. Thank you!!! I do realize that this was the opening weekend of the NCAA basketball tournament, so that may have affected the pace of drink service. The sports book was a zoo--I mean that in a good way. Tons of people cheering on their teams. If you didn't get there early, you were standing the majority of the day. I made my bets early, and I know many people could not get their bets in on time, especially halftime wagers, because of the long lines at the counter. After we checked out of our room, we had our bags held at the bell desk. They obviously do not treat bags well there, because they broke the LCD screen on our laptop, which we did not realize until we got home. All in all I expected more out of Caesars, considering it is supposed to be one of the finer places on the strip. We still had a good time, but not exactly wonderful.

Unlike many other people who seem to complain about everything, we have yet to stay at a Vegas hotel that I would say \u201cnever again.\u201d We had a really good time at Caesars. It\u2019s a large hotel with a lot of people and a lot going on, and has a great center-strip location. We had a great time having drinks at the Shadow Bar and had a few dances at Cleopatra\u2019s Barge. The staff for the most part was friendly and helpful. We stayed in a Forum Tower room on a high floor with a great view of the north strip. The Forum Tower rooms have been renovated and are nicely decorated. The bathroom has a TV built right in to the glass mirror and is one of the cooler things we\u2019ve seen in a room. The Forum Tower is also a great location if you like to stay closer to the action than you get with the other towers. We did not eat at the hotel because the food choices were either pricy restaurants or lower-end food court options. Caesars did have it\u2019s flaws. The casino has a stronger smoke smell than most other hotels. The casino and hotel is also pretty spread out so plan on walking a little more than smaller hotels.

Although more recently renovated, the furnishings had a lot of wear and tear. The furniture surprisingly was very scratched and scuffed up. The chair and couch were not very clean so we didn\u2019t even use them. I thought the general cleanliness of the room and hallways was not up to par with other comparable hotels. Overall, I would give Caesars a 3 \u00bd star rating. I wouldn\u2019t mind staying there again if I can get a good rate (my rate for this trip was about 40% off the normal rate and there was no resort fee like at MGM properties).

The last show I was unfortunate enough to sit behind three women who decided to stand up and dance the entire show. This behavior happened at previous shows but not to me. Although we protested the ushers did nothing. If you tried to take a picture of the show there was immediate action. If you are not wealthy or lucky enough to get a good seat you are better off buying an album or watching them on TV. If you are rude and inconsiderate and like to stand up and dance through the entire show this is your venue.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "magrath, ab", "Title": "\u201cMy favorite hotel in Vegas by far\u201d", "Author": "kkroe77", "ReviewID": "UR126376167", "Content": "I stayed here for 3 nights. they upgraded us to the octavius tower and my goodness was it beautiful.

The towels were large and lush. There was a lighted mirror that was actually well-magnified. There was another lighted mirror in the dressing table. The bedroom had a large, high bed. I thought that the pillows were too firm, but that was my only complaint. The room was well lit and had a large flat screen tv. There was a chaise lounge in the bedroom as well. A particularly nice touch are the reading lights attached to the headboard on either side of the bed. The living room offered a couch and table and chairs. There was also a large flat screened tv and 2 chests. One was below the tv and the other was adjacent to it in the room with all kinds of high-end goodies that one could purchase for exorbitant sums of money. And there is the requisite refrigerator filled with more goods. There was not a refrigerator available to stores any items, although apparently one can request one be placed in the room. There was an entry way with a coat closet and the powder room was located off of it. We were on the 66th floor. The only downside would be (or a plus for some) was that it was a very lengthy walk from the elevator to get anywhere in the hotel from this tower. The Forum, a shopping mall offering virtually every designer desirable is represented here. The layout is in a spiral form. It is very attractive and a place that someone who is looking for that type of shopping experience will have a wonderful time. I enjoyed the casino. I do not play table games and so I cannot comment on them. I did enjoy the variety of slot machines. The staff in the casino was very courteous and kept the facility clean. We did visit the Diamond Lounge and it was a pleasant and relaxing place to be. The food that they served was very eye appealing and quite good. The service was excellent. The only restaurant in the hotel where we dined was one off of the lobby: Central. Our meal was good. There are many choices or renowned restaurants in the hotel. We were going to have lunch at Serendipity when we arrived, but when we walked in the music was too loud for us and left. The pool area looked lovely. The pool was closed during our visit. It was cool and windy during our stay. This hotel clearly trains its staff well because I only experienced one service glitch and that was upon check in. I did the registration myself in the VIP area, but I did not receive VIP treatment. I was ignored. One person was assisting a guest when I arrived and another person behind the counter was on the telephone. However a man came behind the counter and never offered to assist me. When 2 young women arrived he immediately walked up to them and offered assistance. Instead, another woman walked behind the counter and helped the young women. This man never asked me if I could use some help. Since I do not suffer fools well, I went to the office and made my feelings known. The woman who helped me was very kind and efficient.

We thought it was a trick question, but of course we chose the suite. It was fabulous, everything about it, other than the view (of the mountains, not of the strip). It was amazing and I highly recommend the Forum tower over the Octavius Tower. So easy to get to and around for conferences and the casino. We really preferred the bars here to most of the other casinos. We even stayed at the Venetian for a night and completely preferred our room AND the casino & bar to the Venetian. Awesome restaurants (highly recommend Joe's Stone Crabs in the Forum Shops) and highly recommend the Seahorse Bar.

We could not fault the staff, the service here is second to none. As soon as our host at reception found out that we were travelling for my partner's 30th Birthday we were immediately upgraded to the Palace Tower with amazing views of the pool complex. The room was nothing less than stunning, spa jet bath, twin bathroom & queen size bed! Per square foot our suite at Ceasars was bigger than our 2 bed flat at home! My only disappointment from the room was the minibar, it is VERY expensive. There was a vending machine on our floor which charged a reasonable $2.50 for a bottle of Water / Pepsi, versus almost $8.00 for a bottle of water from the minibar; we found it best just to forget it was there! Housekeeping was fabulous & all the staff very polite. Our towels and sheets were changed every night for the 7 nights we stayed. We requested fresh towels one afternoon & they were delivered to our door within 10 minutes! Pretty impressive. Dining was good although expensive. The breakfast buffet at RAO'S was just under $50.00 per couple & the spread wasn't great. Most mornings we skipped breakfast in favour of lunch, it worked out a lot better value for money. We only dined at Caesars 3 nights out of the 7, but there is thousands of great places to eat in Vegas, it seemed a shame to only eat in our hotel! Margaritaville across the street was one of our favourites! I would 100% recommend Caesars Palace if you're looking for a Vegas hotel with the WOW factor, it's right in the heart of things & the hotel grounds are nothing less than stunning - they even make building works look good!

It was hard not to be on our second stay, since we'd actually gotten married at Caesars in the Venus Garden in 2008 (which I highly recommend if you are planning to have a small but formal wedding in Vegas - it was beautiful). We had booked this trip through Travelocity, planning to stay in the Forum Tower this time (the last two times we had stayed in the Palace Tower, which is slightly more expensive). Upon our arrival, we were told that there were no rooms ready in the Forum (it was about 4 p.m.), but the gentleman at the desk immediately made a call and gave us a complimentary upgrade to a room in the Palace Tower, no \"special tip\" necessary. The rooms in the Palace Tower are lovely and quite spacious. The bed was so comfortable and was piled high with extra long pillows (great for me as a traveling pregnant woman!). It was also nice and quiet. The bathroom is large, with a nice shower (although last visit our shower was even nicer, with a dual shower head), double vanity, separate toilet, and 2-person jacuzzi tub. Bath robes are provided. Everything about the room is just comfortable and classy, and very clean. The resort itself is massive, but the signs are very clear and it is easy to find your way around. A special treat are the Forum Shops, where the ceiling is painted to look like the sky at dusk and the wide hallways have comfortable, cushioned benches to sit on if you need a break while shopping. We strolled through the shops on our way further south on the Strip, which was a nice shortcut that helped avoid the crowds on the sidewalk outside. There is a fantastic selection of places to eat at Caesars. Our favorite is actually Payard, which has a small restaurant space that adjoins a larger area where you can pick up to-go items including sandwiches, crepes, ice cream, and gourmet desserts and pastries. In fact, Chef Francois Payard himself was in town during this visit, and it was fun watching him in action while we snacked on crepes in the afternoon and ate a delicious breakfast on our last morning. The pool is absolutely gorgeous, and seating is more than ample. We have stayed at resorts where you have to stake a claim on a pool chair at extremely early hours of the morning, but that is not the case at Caesars (although we haven't stayed there during the summer). Another bonus is the location. We were able to walk everywhere from Caesars (in comfortable shoes!), even all the way down to the MGM Grand and back (it helped that the weather was quite nice during this visit).

The a/c didn't work correctly, the light fixture in the bathroom was broken, the vanity sink was cracked, the paint and wall paper were peeling off the walls and woodwork. I usually try to over look little things but I had a feeling the maid service wasn't cleaning our room very well so I marked the sheets and pillowcase with pen after the first night and I was right, our sheets never got changed the whole time we were there the seven nights. They never cleaned the shower, sinks, or vanity tops. This is really not what you would expect from a hotel that costs this much, or any hotel for that matter. We had food catered by the hotel at our conference several times and there was not one good meal out of all of them. Our last night we had a sit-down dinner in the ballroom and had steak and chicken, the chicken was cold and rubbery and the steak appeared to have been cooked the day before.

More over I am a frequent guest at Harrah's properties. I have given Caesars Place only one stay before and swore I would never return. I am handicapped and can not travel alone. On my previous stay I had asked for and pre-booked adjoining rooms for myself and my helper. Upon check in I was told none were available. I am not about to grease anyones palm, as other reviewers say they do, just to get a room that is medically required. Finally after waiting hours they booked us into the OLD Roman Tower. The room was so old. I was afraid to remove my shoes as the carpet was so stained and very dirty. A 3 days stay resulted in no room service what so ever. No clean towels, no bed service, no clean up of my room. Upon requesting room service my helpers room was cleaned and even though the door was open between our rooms mine was left untouched. There is no ice machine in this tower and if you want ice you have to call room service and of course tip for it. Now for my recent stay. A massive mess up. I had requested the Forum Tower as it is closest to the Colossuem and I had tickets to see Celine Dion. Upon check in at the Diamond center I was informed that Celine was cancelled due to illness. No fault of Caesars I agree. I was given an upgraded room in the Augustus Tower and tickets to Absinthe in place for the Celine Tickets. Just go to the box office to pick up your tickets I was told. We went for dinner and then to the box office only to be informed no tickets had been left in my name. So I trecked back to my room and started making phone calls. By the time all was said and done we missed the first show. So they gave me tickets to the second show, just go to the box office and pick up your tickets. Once again I made the long walk to the box office only to be told once again that no tickets were left in my name. The girl there tried to find out for me but to no avail. I went into the Concierge and spent a long time explaining again to a very nice girl trying to resolve my problem. She was very helpful but became frustrated as well as she was given the run around from department to department. She asked us to sit and wait then told me a supervisor would come and speak to me in 2 minutes. Almost 20 minutes later no one had come so I gave up. I thanked the girl for trying to help me but told her I was not waiting any longer. Poor service to be sure. Though I suppose they really don't care as they have lots of suckers walking through the door. I will never be a sucker again for this property. Now about the room etc. Be very aware that if you are staying at Caesars don't go there on a budget. The restaurants are very, very pricey. If you want coffee or a pop in your room make sure you read the price menu. To have a morning cup of coffee will cost you $12.00. As I have said I have stayed at many properties and most will provide you with at least coffee for the room. EVERYTHING on the counter and in the the fridge are on pressure sensors. So if you remove it you are charged for it. I have included pictures of the price menu. Upon check out I was informed that my confirmation for my tickets was on my bill. So once again I had to explain the whole situation over again and have charges for comped tickets removed from my bill. Comped is suppose to be free not charged to your room. Every item that was lifted and examined from the counter and the fridge was also on the room charge. We never used any of it.

Thoughts: \u2022 Over the last decade, they have done all the smart improvements to take this property back to its status as best-in-class. Highlights: The lobby is stunning o The new towers are modern, stylish, and upscale o The pool is beautiful o They have several world class culinary offerings, and several more interesting offerings. o The spa is brand new and cool o The mall is still cool and interesting o Many of the areas of the casino are state-of-the art o Having a quick serve, food court is super convenient. Sometimes you just want a simple lunch o Lunch at Payards is one of my favorites in town o The location is great for walking around the strip \u2022 Though the improvements are great, there are some elements that prevent this from being a top tier property: o It is sprawling, confusing, and a bit eclectic - o Retaining the original \u201cgambling dome\u201d is kind of cool, in a retro way. Its also kind of weird. o Check in can be a nightmare o It felt big, too crowded. o No resort fees is good, but they are all about the nickel and dime mentality. $12 for in-room coffee is a bit of a turn off. $23 for a red bull vodka was no joy either. o The Augustus rooms are solid, I hear some of the others can be pretty weak Parts of it are nice, as nice as any property. But its just not a cohesive, service oriented experience. If it\u2019s your first time staying in Vegas, you will probably love it (if you have the right budget for incidentals). If you\u2019ve been there before, and stayed at a lessor property, you will probably love it (if you don't order vodka red bull). If you love giant cruise ship experiences, you will feel at home. But if you been to Vegas and stayed at Wynn, Encore, Venetian, Cosmo, or even Bellagio, you might be disappointed. If you are there for a conference, and work is paying for it, you won\u2019t complain. Finally, if you are a gambler, I would label this place as \u201cgambler friendly\u201d for mid-stakes table players. Many of the dealers, particularly in the \u201cdome\u201d, are long term professionals. They know what its about, and they have some great stories. AND, OMG, they let me use my cell phone while at the table (for texting \u2013 talking would be rude). R-E-F-R-E-S-H-I-N-G. As far as comps for table goes, who knows these days. Some of our group did some substantial gambling, and only received a portion of \u201cconsideration\u201d that they would have years ago.

I've been to third world countries with better amenities and services. Okay where to begin...Let's start with something positive about the hotel...the \"junior suite\" was a nice room, however I've been to hotels that their regular rooms offers the same type set-up for much less. It's sad to say that was the only positive thing about Caesars Palace, I experienced. Now to the traveler beware and please read this prior to going to Las Vegas and especially if you are considering Caesars Palace. I arrived on a Thursday evening to what I thought was a full PRE-PAID (Booked through personal travel agent) Las Vegas trip to arrive at a crowded check in area with only, oh maybe 3 desk agents servicing 300 people, it was unbelievable that I was having a \"Wal-Mart\" moment at Caesars Palace! You know the moment when the line is to the back of the store with only one register open??? I was thinking I paid too much money and I am sure all these other people paid just as much not to have everyone of the agent booth manned! Strike one! Next I get to the counter and the agent informs me \"Yes your room expenses are fully paid, however you are only in a deluxe room, it you pay an additional $40 a night we will upgrade you to a junior suite with flat screen TV and jetted tub\". I chuckled because again I am in Vegas having to pay additional for a flat screen TV and jetted tub? I get that at Holiday Inn or Crowne Plaza or the Marriott in standard room. So with that being said, I was scared as to what I would get in the \"deluxe\" room I pre-paid for so the Las Vegas novice in me took the bait and paid for the upgrade no problem. The property is huge, so it is best practice if it is your first time to Caesars Palace to consult someone that has been there to know where everything is otherwise when you get there you will miss out on a lot because there is no welcome service at Caesar\u2019s! There is a concierge lobby that the line stays out the door with and coming in on a late East Coast to West Coast flight trying to gather your bearings waiting for someone to help you at Caesars will make you want to act out so please please checkout Trip advisor prior to your trip! Next thing please please please be advised that although you may have paid thousands of dollars for your accommodations, nothing, I mean nothing, is complimentary at Caesar Palace! Internet is a $14.99 charge for a 24 hour period and for my fellow fitness junkies, be prepared to pay $25 a day to use the fitness center or pack your mace to fight off the bandits, drunks, and panhandlers while you run the strip. Every other Casino I visited while there had a buffet available but not Caesar! The restaurant staff was not friendly at all and I started to think that it was because I was paying with my visa instead of the black amex? I would hate to think that was the case Caesar. I ordered room service the first morning I was there and it came over an hour late, it was freezing cold and items were missing but charged, however I did dispute the charge at checkout and it was removed from my bill. The Casinos had no air ventilation to take out the smoking that was going on so if you are sensitive to smoke do not I repeat do not go to Caesar Casino! I could not enjoy the casino because of their inability to properly ventilate the smoking. I've been to Casinos in other places and have never experienced the second hand smoke that was going on in Caesars! To make a long story with so many disappointments short, I would not recommend Caesar Palace. It is way over priced for what you will get.

I could not help feeling this was to squeeze every last dollar out of you by making you buy the extremely over priced drinks downstairs. The view we had was through a dirty window behind another tower and it was all very underwhelming. Check in was very slow, a really big queue for each receptionist. In hindsight, I think it might be better to spend a bit more money on your room and get a better one in a more modern tower. The good aspect of our stay in Caesars Palace was its location, so central making accessing all the areas very easy. If you are driving and want to save some money, it\u2019s very easy to Self Park for free. A Las Vegas highlight for me was the Beatles Love show. I thought it was just amazing, if you like the Beatles, you\u2019ll love it!

As you book your reservation for Caesar's Palace, please note that what you see on the website in regards to the room you are booking is not necessarily what you are going to get when you get there. I had stayed previously at Caesar's Palace in an Augustus Tower Deluxe Room. That room was beautiful--clean and remodeled--absolutely gorgeous. I was so impressed, that for the next trip I booked to Vegas, I went online to the Caesar's Palace website and specifically booked and PAID IN FULL for an Augustus Tower Deluxe Room. At check-in I was told there were no Augustus Tower Deluxe Rooms available, but they did have a Palace Tower room available. When I got to my Palace Tower room, I was mortified--it was a standard room--remodeled, but clearly smaller and not the same quality or appearance as the Augustus Tower Deluxe Room. In speaking with management to request the room I had originally reserved and paid for, I was told they have the right to substitute based on availability and pointed out the fine print on my paid reservation stating the same thing. They offered no resolve and kept quoting the previous statement over and over and over. I demanded a credit and booked a stay at a different hotel. What makes me so mad is the principle. Not only is it sad to think anyone going to Vegas for an anniversary, a honeymoon, or other special event may book and pay for the room of their choice and then upon arrival get switched to a lesser quality, smaller room \"based on availability,\" but also when booking the reservation, I paid for an Augustus Tower Deluxe Room which was quite higher in price than the Palace Tower (standard) room. When I brought this up to management, no effort was made to monetarily adjust my reservation. I am definitely a small fish in the sea of Caesar's Palace guests, but I can sincerely say I will NEVER give them (or any Total Rewards property) my business again.

Also the hotel is centrally located mid-Strip. I had an adjoining room here and (like my experience in other hotels), it was like sharing a room with those next door. Try to avoid. Also, watch your hotel bill. As part of our conference package we had a special one-time payment for Internet and gym access during our whole stay -- but a daily Internet fee still showed up on my bill which I had to call to have corrected -- which seemed to cause quite a bit of confusion on the hotel's part. I also had charges on my bill for the mini-bar which I did not use. So be careful and keep a good eye on your hotel charges. Caesars and its affiliate hotels make advertise about having no resort fees, but then you are charged daily for Internet usage, gym usage, and so on, services which are usually covered in other hotels' resort fees.

My friends have stayed at a variety of hotels, on and off the strip, but nobody can claim complete satisfaction. Except me. From the ambiance to the professional staff at every turn, I highly recommend this property. The concierge office can adroitly handle almost any request. The front desk staff are friendly and personable. If you wish to spend some time at the tables, check out the P*****cat Dolls section. Yes, the music is a bit loud but if, like me, you enjoy contemporary music, then the ladies here will greet you warmly and make your gaming experience relatively painless. As to the room, I always book in the Augustus tower and the rooms are just \"sick\". The area has to be close to 900 square feet (perhaps even more) but the bathrooms are simply over-the-top. Twin basins, a whirlpool tub, glassed-in shower and a separate small room containing the toilet with the obligatory telephone on the wall. There's even a television in the bathroom, with remote, which you can watch while enjoying a bath. Unlike other hotels on the strip, the walls here are solid and I didn't hear my neighbors or traffic in the hallway. Room and maid service is just what you'd expect from a hotel of this caliber: respectful, considerate and consummately professional. They're also very friendly if you take a moment to stop and chat with them. I suggest doing so anyway to demonstrate respect for the jobs they do. Given my busy schedule, I didn't get to enjoy the pool this time around but thoroughly enjoyed it last time. It's heated and I was able to put in a good number of laps before some other people decided to join in and it was time to return to my room.

I had visions of a massive, NASA-style mission control centre with a heap of dudes standing over a massive Battleship-style gameboard, trying to fit everyone in. We did ask for two rooms on the same floor but these were not available. So instead, we were given two rooms in the Forum Tower and ... wait for it ... upgraded to suites! YAY! Nothing like a free upgrade to perk up the spirits of a weary traveller. Lucky we were in the same tower because getting to them from the reservation area is quite a trip. But so worth it ... massive room with separate TV and dining area. Powder room, massive king bed in a separate bedroom, huge bathroom with double vanity, spa tub, huge shower and separate toilet. The vanity even had a tv in it. Hell, I could have sub-let the walk-in wardrobe and made some money off the deal. The Forum Tower was tastefully decorated and in excellent condtion. The bed was comfortable. Most importantly, the room was so, so, so quiet. My room had sort-of Strip views, with massive windows and a window ledge to sit on to watch it all unfold. I don't have any complaints at all and would certainly stay at Caesars again. It's centrally-located on the Strip, right in the middle of everything. And the value for money was superb. The room at Caesars was spectacular, the rest of the trip to Vegas - not so much.

Once in our room it was large, nicely decorated and very clean only down it did not have a view. The next morning my back was hurting due to my scoliosis and so I asked the desk if they had any other rooms available with maybe a different bed that may help he offered me the Octavious Tower Deluxe room since they are newer and at no extra charge. We moved our stuff over and again the room was gorgeous and this time with a pool view. Only downside was the Octavious Tower is further from the casino floor and we got a room at the very end of the hall for the next 2 nights. But I will not complain. The bed was about the same no matter there. The room service was pricey but prompt and hosts were quite courteous we enjoyed the oversized soaker jetted tub with the tv in the bathroom as well. Our service on the casino floor was excellent with everyone we encountered. Caesars is quite large and we had to learn our way around but the availability and choices of games was nice. (didnt hurt that I won a nice jackpot on a dollar slot, pennies paid well too) My husband appreciated the Poker room for it's availability of games and tournaments as well. For Valentine's dinner we ate at the Homestead had a wonderful meal and again our waiter was very professional and personable. The same night we had a casino host come visit my husband while he played at a slot machine which made us feel a little VIP... At which she told us to visit the host office upon checking out. The morning we checked out we did go see a host and based upon our play all room charges were additionally comped!

If you so choose, you wouldn't ever need to leave the building to find food, shopping, a comfortable walk, people watching and gambling. Obviously, the vibe throughout the hotel/casino/shopping areas is essentially ancient Rome as envisioned during its heyday. You'll find lots of fountains, columns, statues (including a reproduction of Michaelangelo's David and a very noisy homage to the Trevi Fountain), and many other grandiose architectural reproductions that mimic many of the sites you'd find in Rome. For those who've never been to Italy, it can be a jaw-dropper and a perpetual photo-op (not so much for those who have been to Rome and around Italy.) In any event, the whole ancient Roman theme works well, including the costumes of many of the Caesar's staff that you'll see throughout the property. We recently stayed in the Forum Tower and found our room to be good size, with a king-bed, a walk-in shower big enough for two and lots of counter space around the sink. There is an in-room safe in the closet for your valuables.

First of all, the check in process was long and grueling. As a whole, the staff was not helpful. One problem, I believe was that they were booked to capacity and didn't have ample staff available to deal with all the people that had reserved that weekend. After finally getting our room, we were brought to the wrong room and asked to change rooms because of their error and was a big hassle for us after waiting all day. The room was actually very nice and clean. We rented a poolside gazebo and that was verY nice also. The value is terrible, tho. I would expect that after making thousands of dollars on the wedding, the hotel would have been a little more accomodating. Not so. The pool staff is very strict about what is brought in to the pool area. I can understand this, but when I buy a soda for $4 a pop at the gazebo and canot bring it back in later (security followed me to the garbage and made sure I dumped it out, even after I explained that I had purchased it there),I find this offensive, ridiculous and embarrasing. On check out, we again had problems. When reviewing our bill, we realized we were charged twice for the gazebo. After an hour on an extremely frustrating phone call while the bellman waited patiently in the hallway, the dilemma was resolved. They had indeed overcharged us. Another problem: the show we had booked was closed due to. \"technical difficulties\" and we had a hard time getting our money back. They were more than willing to booked us on a later show, however. I think my husband finally got the $ back on his credit card, but it was a week or more later, and another big hassle of waiting on the phone after long busy signals. also, they charge a$50 safety deposit for each room at check in, and actually charge the credit card for several days after you leave.

Usually a decent tip or paid upgrade does the trick. {ET OWNERS: This , like all caesars properties has a Pet Stay program where they issue a bowl, bedding, treats etc. FOOD: has gone up in price from my visit last month. I suggest you budget for that. Almost all of the food outlets owned by Caesars are very good. In fact one of the finest in Vegas if not the country is Guy Savoy! Payard has a restaurant and bistro, both are great and offers a fixed price menu for dinner. Rao's is great or awful depending on the time and their mood... Central, Caesars take on a coffe shop is great 24/7. Waiter Laurant is very personable and professional. Bradley Ogden is awful with service to match..hopefully the new Gordon Ramsay will be there by your visit. The food court is vegas reasonable. General service is great throughout.

When arriving in Las Vegas for a 5 night stay, we were excited as we were going to be seeing Elton John. Upon our arrival we saw huge check-in lines but there was a \u201cinvited guest\u2019s line\u201d. We went to the invited guests line and after 3 or 4 minutes of line the guy in front of me started to chat me up and tell me how everything takes so long to get at Caesars and he was down here to change rooms because he had bedbugs and said to me \u201cbut don\u2019t worry if you come close to me because they are not catching\u201d We were still waiting as there were still 2 customers in front of me another lady came over and I asked \u201cis there anyway you can get me checked-in in the next 2 minutes\u201d and she said to me \u201cwell maybe not 2 minutes but come with me\u201d We moved all the way over to the other side of the desk, we got checked in. Upon check-in\u201d I had asked if there was anyway we could be escorted to our room as it is quite a large hotel with many towers \u2013 I\u2019m not used to this\u201d She made a phone call and mentioned to me it would be 20 minutes before someone could escort us to our room \u2013 we both laughed and she showed me on a map where our room was. We went up to the room where everything was fine until we called down to room service as there weren\u2019t any glasses in our suite room. The lady on the phone told us if were ordering 4 champagne glasses \u2013 4 regular glasses and a bucket of ice there would be a $10.00 charge. I thought this was ridiculous but we needed the glasses and we didn\u2019t have a choice. The next day was a beautiful sunny day and we were looking forward to going to the pool. When we went out to the pool area we noticed that most of it was in shade so we walked all the way to the back and we saw one beautiful empty pool that was roped off. We noticed that there was a lot of tension in the air and upon looking around and asking more questions we realized why as everyone was crammed into one little edge of the large pool where the sun was coming around behind the building but the pool that was in full sun view was not open. I guess people were trying to go over there and sit there and there was security kicking them out, this was quite an interesting scene. When I found out this was going on I started walking around and I realized there was another pool up some stairs and this pool was open although you had to rent a cabana for $200.00 a day and for that you get free food. We decided this would be our best option because it was easy, the sun was shining and our cabana also over looked the other empty pool. Right away when we settled down we decided to order some food and this is where the tricky part came in. The food order for the first item, which was a 7up took 45 minutes and from there on it was a catastrophe and even after talking to management they couldn\u2019t get anything right as all they had was a lot of excuses. After a day of being ripped off at the pool and poor service we decided to go Nobu at the Hard Rock \u2013 it was a great dinner. Then we went back and went to Elton John and his show was fantastic. Instead of staying at Caesars next time we will stay somewhere else and still go to Elton John, that was the best part of our trip. Dealing with the check out was another major hassle, even trying to get a cab away from the hotel, it\u2019s just not worth it, there\u2019s nothing great there and it\u2019s not a happening scene.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scranton, PA", "Title": "\u201cPlanning a Vegas trip?

The rooms are large, clean and nice, but there is very little insulation between them, meaning you can hear into your neighbors' room very easily. We had very loud partiers in the adjoining room from 4 p.m. into the wee hours and despite several calls, they continued. We asked to be changed, and though the hotel was obviously not full (Wed. night) the shift manager Sharia/Shania? refused to change us stating the hotel was sold out. I'm sorry, any hotel charging $300 per night + and of that size would allot a certain number of rooms to be vacant for problems such as ours. But again, it was Wednesday night and it definitely didn't appear that they were full, but we assumed it was probably a hotel policy not to switch rooms for anyone. So this is what you're in for if you spend that much money. Because of all the problems, I finally called Guest Services to ask \"HOW MANY STARS IS THIS HOTEL?\". \" IT'S 3 STARS,\" he said. So there you have it: CAESARS IS A 3 STAR HOTEL.

The room looked good but we soon found problems, tap not working, heating not working, piece of metal sticking out of the bed. The next morning I made a polite complaint at reception (different clerk) and they were really apologetic. They gave us a $50 credit to our account and also changed the room to the 25th floor in the same tower. Same size room but 100 times better, looked newer and with a view of the Strip looking north over The Mirage, The Palace, Venetian, etc. House keeping on the 12th floor was not as good as the 25th floor, I guess that's the luck of the draw. Hotel is big and grand but we got our bearings pretty quick, probably because my wife used the shops as landmarks while mine were fixed on the flashing lights.

Secondly because of the central location on the strip and thirdly because they do not charge an additional daily resort fee. It is a very pretty hotel with a lovely spa and great pools (although only 1 open in the winter, unsurprisingly. We found that the staff were friendly, welcoming and helpful on both the concierge, bell and main reception desk. The only reason I have not given an excellent score is due to the terrible service we had at check in where an employee called Sergio gave us our worst Vegas experience. Unfortunately we picked the wrong queue to stand in, but not only did all the other queues move faster than ours, the lady looking after the queue right next to us turned her whole queue of around 10 people around 3 times in the time the 7 people in front of me were served. We queued for 1.5 hours while the 7 people in front of us were served by Sergio. Why did we not move queues you ask? Beleive me we wish we did but we convinced ourselves that Sergio was spending extra time and effort on each customer and giving them lots of help and advice for their Vegas experience, helping them book good deals etc etc so we decided we would like to have the extra service. Alas, when we got to the front we realised that Sergio was in appearence completely computer illiterate and was only typing around 6 words a minute. twice while he was serving us, a guy who appeared to be his manager had a word in his ear and appeared to by trying to speed him up. My advice, avoid the queue with the guy with the Sergio name tag and you should be fine. The spa was a dissappointment to us also but not because it was not nice to use but because they seperate men and women due to clothing being optional. This was dissappointing for us as we expected to have a coupld of hours relaxing as a couple together and chatting in the jacizzi and steam rooms. Apparently all hotel spas in vegas are the same however so clearly the demand for separation is high but I wish Caesars would put in a special couples section also to cater to couples who want to do spa stuff together. There are couples treatments however so you can have a massage with your other half. Other than this, for any Vegas virgins, my advice is book your tickets for shows and grand canyon trips online as the deals are cheaper than anything we found in vegas. If you book a ticket to one show however and you want another for another show at the same hotel, check at the box office to see if they will give you the 2-4 1 discount for already booking 1 of their shows. Caesars give you a booklet of vouchers with some 2-4-1s but not for anything we wanted to see (mainly the cheap and not very popular shows). Absinthe is a Ceasars Palace based show and is absolutely hilarious so I highly recommend it to anyone not easily offended.

Not only did we find the hotel far too big, it took 15 mins to walk from our room in the Palace Tower to the front door, but the rooms were aging, customer service (not the front desk staff they were awesome), and the casino were severely lacking in our minds. The room was very large; we got upgraded from the Forum Tower to the Palace Tower by the front desk staff member (thank you!). There was a separate shower, tub and a water closet. The baseboards in the bathroom were grubby and were falling apart, the hallway was dingy, but the sheets were clean and the view was excellent from the 5th floor. We called down as soon as we checked in to ask for Non-down pillows because I am really allergic, and I was asked how many I needed. I advised the staff member that 4 would be needed because we'd be replacing all the pillows on the bed. About 1 hr later, 1 pillow showed up. We didn't want to cause a fuss but it was pretty annoying sleeping on one pillow all 4 days and sneezing at night because my husband had to sleep with the down filled ones. I was told to head to the spa, which I did and it was nice but the infamous snow room is something you can definitely skip. It's loud and really lack-lustre, but the baths, steam and sauna rooms make up for it. Don't go to the cafe, it's a waste of money. I had the lemon chicken at the chinese food place there and I felt sick later that night, an order of lemon chicken and a Smirnoff Ice cost me $18. A bit excessive, even for Vegas. There were very few tables open for blackjack, and those that were had high minimums ($25) so if you aren't a higher roller, you'll need to head somewhere else to gamble. Serendipity 3 was amazing though. Have the \"High Heel Pump\", best sandwich ever!

There was no coffee maker in the room forcing you to go down to the shops, wait in line and bring it back to the room. You have to walk through quite a bit of the casino to get to the pools. The hot tubs one might expect in the pool complex were closed forcing you to pay $45 to use those in the Spa, which was also only accessible by walking through quite a bit of the casino. Lastly, many of the better dance clubs and restaurants are not in Caesars. It is also not one of the better places to gamble. This was our first time at Caesars and we were the guest of friends.

We stayed in a Deluxe August Tower room on the 31st floor. There were two queen beds with a night stand in between, alarm clock/CD player and phone, a desk with a lamp and phone (wi-fi is $14.99 per day), 32\u201d flat screen TV on top of dresser drawers. There\u2019s a mini bar refrigerator. There\u2019s no room to put any of your personal food items in the refrigerator. On top of the dresser is a refreshment center with snacks for an extra charge of course. There\u2019s a table with two chairs, 2 drinking glasses, an ice bucket. There\u2019s also a Keurig coffee maker, but you have to pay $12 for the coffee. So you can bring your own coffee bags or tea. There\u2019s also a sitting area with a sofa, coffee table, and sofa chair. We had a great view of the Bellagio Fountains, facing Flamingo Ave. There\u2019s a hallway closet with two Caesar\u2019s Palace bath robes, an iron, ironing board, luggage valet, and an electronic safe on the right side of the closet wall. There\u2019s a huge full size framed mirror on the opposite wall of the closet. The bathrooms are beautiful with marble floors. A walk-in shower with a clear glass door, an over-sized sunken spa tub with jets, dual sinks, magnified vanity mirror, 2 glasses, and tissue box. There\u2019s also a 17\u201d flat screen TV viewable from the spa tub. The toilet is in a separate room with a door you can close. Toiletries include: Qua Baths & Spa brand shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, body lotion, skin bar, and bath bar. The drawer contained a hair dryer, a beauty kit with two cotton balls and two cotton tips, a sewing kit, and a shoe polishing kit. The beds are really comfortable. Be careful of some of the pillows with prickly feathers. I would have loved the comforters to be softer though. Valet parking could be a good wait unless you\u2019re a Seven Star, Diamond, or VIP member. You can self-park, but it\u2019s on the far end from the Augustus Tower. If you take the Appian Way walkway to the left of the hotel registration, it cuts a little of your walk time. As far as gambling, it was the usual holiday bump in the limits. You can\u2019t find anything under a $25 minimum table. The casino itself wasn\u2019t crowded. There were pits that were not in use. I love staying at Caesar\u2019s Palace.

However, we stayed in the \"Roman Tower\" which is old and dingy. My room at The Orleans was nicer than this room. The halls smelled of mildew and shampoo. I am a registered dietitian for a living. So naturally my husband and I enjoy quality healthy food. This is pretty much impossible to find on premises of caesars. It is also very expensive! Room service for hardboiled eggs (2), turkey bacon, rye toast, wheat toast, and a pitcher of iced tea was $52.80! It was hot and delicious but a 50 dollar breakfast? Seriously? Also, we are very active. We figured since caesars is considered \"upscale\" they would have a fitness center on premisis. They do, but what they fail to tell you at check in when you ask is that they charge you $25 a day to use it. That is a complete rip off and we ended up running up and down the strip every morning instead. The poker room is great. My husband and I spend a lot of time in poker rooms and we absolutely hate the Bellagio. Caesars is the nicest poker room on the strip by far.

We checked in about an hour before official check-in time and were told that the only room ready in our category was room #503 in Palace Tower. We were tired and still on eastern time so we said ok. I had heard about a $20 trick (wrap your credit card with $20 bill at check in) to get a \u201ccomplimentary\u201d upgrade in Vegas but didn\u2019t try. When we found our floor and were walking toward the room, a housekeeping supervisor greeted us and asked us how we were. I said ok but not too happy about being on the lowest floor with guest rooms. She walked with us to the room. I looked out the window and saw a gravel roof just below with spotlights. I was not amused at the thought of bright lights plus there were ballrooms and such just below us. She called the front desk and room #2210 was miraculously available; perhaps, it would have been available earlier with \u201c$20 trick\u201d! She walked with us and took us to our new room. It had a view to the south and was much improved! It had the same, exact interior floor plan. I did not get her name, but she went above and beyond-a rare 5 in our stay at Caesars. The only slight inconvenience was that she said a bellman would be by in about 15 minutes, maybe a little longer she warned due to the check-in traffic, with our new room keys. Over an hour later, no room keys so I called. A very friendly and energetic bellman showed up about 20 minutes later and said he was bringing our luggage. I said we were waiting for our keys, and he then remembered his side task that he had been given while delivering someone else\u2019s luggage. I kidded him and said is this \u201cLet\u2019s make a Deal\u201d? Can I exchange a key for the luggage and see if I get a zonk? He laughed! The room, which was not as deep and large as the website\u2019s pictures made it appear, had an entry way with closets (including a very welcome safe) on the left and the bathroom on the right followed by a vanity area. The closet had hangers, a luggage rack, and an iron with board. Once past the corridor, the mostly square room had a king-sized bed with end tables on each side. Each had a lamp, with a clock on the left table and a phone on the right table. The phone book and Gideon Bible were in the one with the phone. The bed was not as comfortable as many others where I\u2019ve stayed at similar priced hotels like Intercontinental, Hiltons, and Melia boutiques, or even at lower priced ones like Hampton Inn and Staybridge. There were several pillows but the main ones were lumpy. There were ample electrical outlets for those that need them. The bed was on the right as you entered the main room, and there was an etagere with flat screen tv (the television always came on very loud so be prepared with hand on volume button so you can turn down quickly to save your ears and those in the next rooms) and small cabinets above. On the flat part, there were overpriced mini-bar snacks and souvenirs (i.e. snacks $8-$12 except for one tiny can of Pringles for $3, and an ice bucket. Ice was conveniently available and amazingly free just past the elevators on the left. Under the flat part were drawers and cubby holes for clothes. On the left was the mini-fridge with items from $4 (a can of soda) to $35 (premium 375ml liquor). Some other examples included an intimacy package for $20, an underwater camera (in Vegas?) for $24, domestic beer for $6, and a 4 serving coffee package for $12. The desk just past the etagere had another phone, a lamp, and a coffee pot. (No free coffee or tea-this was a first even at the finest hotels that had a kettle or similar) Not sure if I could have used my own coffee or tea-probably sensored and would charge another fee! On the right past the end table there was a nice chair and a small round table. There was also a small coffee table and sofa in the center. The sofa did not have a bed. The window was floor to ceiling and was the center \u00be or so of the wall. It had a fantastic view, especially after dark, as I mentioned earlier. The bathroom was very nice. Upon arrival, we found the light burned out in the toilet room. When I called about the keys not arriving after over an hour, I also mentioned this. When we returned from our early dinner, the light had been changed and a nice note was left on the ledge by the room entrance that it had been done. The bathroom had a Jacuzzi, which I used often, a separate shower with good showerhead and great pressure, a double sink area, and plenty of counter space in between the sinks. The left sink didn\u2019t drain when I shaved the second morning so I left a note for the maid. Upon our return that evening, there was a voice message on the phone, as was also the case with the light on the first day, but no note. The sink seemed to drain much better but the fix seemed temporary so I would expect the next guest to have a similar issue if filling the sink. There were several nice amenities provided, some on the counter and some in the drawer with a blow dryer. One big positive about the bathroom was that the tile floor wasn\u2019t slippery, even when wet. One negative was that when one of the nearby rooms was filling their hot tub, there was a lot of pipe noise. I wonder how much our neighbors enjoyed my late night or early morning luxury baths although I heard no other guest noise during my stay, and this was another positive. All in all to sum up my stay, I doubt I would stay at Caesars again. It wasn\u2019t worth the price with everything being a la carte. My overall rating of 3 is based on my expectations at this caliber of hotel. The internet was $15 per 24 hour period, which I refused to pay, so I was unable to check my email, look at Vegas options, etc. Harrah\u2019s group, which includes Caesars, Paris, Flamingo, Rio, and more advertises that they charge no resort fee. I had rather pay a small resort fee and get some extras. The mini-bar items were also all monitored by sensor so if you moved anything, you would be charged within 30 seconds. I had to be very careful walking to the bathroom at night so I didn\u2019t accidentally bump into the etagere. I also would breathe in the opposite direction when in that area. There was no space in the fridge for any personal items, although they did offer an extra one. I\u2019m not sure if there would have been a charge since I didn\u2019t really need one, but given all the other fees, I would not be surprised. It\u2019s sort of like tax free state in New England that charges fees on everything. I stayed at Tuscany last year, which also charges an Internet fee for access from hotel rooms and does also have a resort fee, but you can use you computer with free wifi in common areas so at least you can check email while eating. You also get a coupon package which offsets most of the fee. I also have stayed at the Holiday Inn just down Flamingo from Tuscany near Terribles and got free Internet and a free shuttle to the strip, but they have no upgrade rooms even for Platinum Priority Club members. You have to look at the overall picture and decide what is most important to you for a pleasant stay in Vegas. It\u2019s a subjective decision depending on the traveler. Next time, I\u2019m going to try Venetian or Palazzo since I\u2019ve joined their Grazie program. I still highly recommend the $29.95 brunch buffet on Sunday at Envy in the Renaissance near the convention center and monorail stop, although we walked both ways. Harrah\u2019s advertises their 24 hour super buffet pass for about $45, but in small print, it says black-out dates apply, and guess what, I was there over Christmas weekend, which was blacked out! I had built up a good amount of Total Rewards points from my slot machine play at the Harrah\u2019s properties plus my Total Rewards credit card, so I did have lunch at Paris in the Brasserie and did try the Saturday night buffet at Caesars, both for just rewards points and nothing out of pocket except tip. The lunch at the Paris was fantastic with great service, and I enjoyed my lamb burger. 80% of the guests at the buffet were Asian, and the buffet choices were Asian/Christmas and included sushi, Chinese ribs, steamed rice and more along with turkey, overcooked lamb, prime rib, ham, mashed sweet potatoes, green bean casserole, and stuffing. There weren\u2019t many other vegetable selections. The highlight for most of the guests seemed to be the crab legs. Peel and eat shrimp plus lobster bisque or clam chowder and others were offered as well. The dessert selection was fantastic and included a strawberry chocolate dipping station. I didn\u2019t have crab legs since they weren\u2019t precracked as they were at the Envy brunch in May. (this was the one thing missing when I was there this time) Knife and fork were in napkin at table, but crab crackers and spoons were hard to find. I did find a bowl of various sized spoons by the carving station! I had the breakfast buffet at Caesars a year or so ago, when the buffet pass wasn\u2019t blacked out, and enjoyed it more than any of the other Harrah buffets. I so recommend their breakfast buffet but not their dinner one. The greeter also seemed annoyed that we didn't want to sit next to rambunctious children so she sat us in the very back! I wish I had gone to Paris\u2019 buffet for dinner. Rio has the largest selection but requires a free shuttle from Paris or Harrah\u2019s to reach. The ceilings in the casino at Caesars, except for the newer Coliseum area, were low. This meant poor ventilation and very smoky. My throat itched after my visits. Paris and Venetian were the best ventilated that I visited. I also found the machines not as friendly at Caesars but that\u2019s hit or miss anywhere. I get too nervous to do the gaming tables. On the way to checkout, I saw a lady pushing a baby carriage with her Pomeranian (no baby) so dogs were allowed. I did see a few other pampered pooches there also. Checkout was quick and efficient, but it was just after 7 am so no rush of people. I applied the remaining balance on my Total Rewards account to my bill so it was $20 less than it would have been. Lady at desk was very courteous and made my last memory a pleasant one. We took a taxi to Tuscany for breakfast before heading to the airport. I\u2019m glad I stayed at Caesars since it was one of those items on my \u201cbucket\u201d list. Now, that\u2019s done! If I were to stay at a Harrah\u2019s property again, I would probably pick one where I have not stayed: Bally\u2019s, Harrah\u2019s or Rio.

The older asian female dealer, I believe her name was Vicki, greeted me with a scowl. I should have left then but I wanted to play Pai-gow. She was very rude from the beginning to the very end. After I sat down, one of the players lost a few hands in a row. The dealer, several times, spoke to her in Chinese or Vietnamese and kept glancing at me which made me annoyed me very much. When a new player joined the table, he asked a question about the game, she was busy so I started to explain but was interrupted with a nasty, \"He asked me, not you. I can handle this.\" I attempted to ignore her since I was getting along with the other players. She basically told me to keep my mouth shut and not to talk to her so I did not. When one of the players won a big hand, I told him, \"----, nice hand.\" I was immediately scolded for swearing. I know profanity is unnecessary but I wasn't using it to degrade anyone or even talking to the dealer. I was congratulating the player. Anyways, I said, \"Whatever.\" Then after about 15 minutes the player next to me won another big hand. I told him, \"Shoot, nice hand,\" and we high-five'd. She immediately called the floor manager who came over and chastised me like a little school-boy. I tried to explain to him what had happened but he walked away. I know I don't gamble as much as some people do but I don't think I should be treated in that manner. I talked to the floor manager later and he explained that he has to take the word of his dealers which made sense to me since the boss should support his staff. However, the dealer had no excuse for being so rude. I am not a saint but I usually get along with most people. I normally have a great time in Vegas and have had people I played with the day before greet me by name when we run into each other. I have had my share of rude dealers, but she was by far the worse dealer and one of the rudest people I have ever met. Since I had had a few drinks, I thought it might have been my fault so I slept on it without filing a complaint right away. When I mentioned the story to another blackjack dealer the next day, I was asked, \"Was her name Vicki?\" which told me this was not her first incident. I told the story to two other dealers to see what they would say and her name was the first name they both guessed. I have never had any problems with any of the Caesar's staff or even any other casino's staff for that matter. I slept on in for two nights to get a more objective perspective. I am still fuming as I write this. She not only ruined this one trip but I don't think I'll ever stay at Caesars because of this. Out of all the Harrah's properties, my wife likes Caesars the best which is why we stayed there. I will probably stay at Bellagio or Aria next time. No one should be treated the way she treated me. I did not think I was going to file a complaint so I did not write her name down. I should have because like I said, it has been a couple of days and I am still very upset.

We checked into Caesars on a Sunday afternoon and we did not get off to a good start. There was a huge check-in queue which we were expecting after reading all the other trip advisor reviews. However what we weren\u2019t expecting was to receive an upgrade to the Centurion Tower since the Augustus and the Palace Tower which we were booked into were full due to a conference\u2026we were checking in at 3pm, why was our room already given away? Regardless Adam at check in built up the upgrade so much we accepted the upgraded room. Unlike my husband I was very put off by the upgraded room (which apparently runs for an extra US$300.00 a night on top of what we were paying for a deluxe room!!!). Firstly you have to walk the whole casino floor to get to the lifts for the Centurion Tower; the Centurion Tower is a very old and tired tower, when you walk out of the lift onto the non-smoking floor it smelt of smoke. Don\u2019t get me wrong the actual room was bigger than my house (it had a theater room, etc), but everything in the room was warn, out of date, loud to operate (air-conditioner & Spa) and there was no instructions on how to use anything (ie: the tv in the theater room). Needless to say I wanted out of this \u201cupgraded\u201d room. We went to reception and after 15 minutes of complaining, they finally agreed to move us the next day. The next day we moved into a room in the Augustus Tower. Absolutely gorgeous! The room & bathroom was huge, clean, well appointed, did not smell of smoke and you did not have to walk through the whole casino to get to your room. The location of the hotel was great it was right in the heart of the strip and you were quite easily able to go to a few different hotels for dinner or shows without too much of a hassle. Pool area was great, just a shame it took forever to get a drink! We ate in several restaurants; Rao\u2019s being the worst (overpriced, appalling service, and very very average food!) and Noodle 9 (expensive but great menu and food) being the best. We also visited the bar near the reception area for drinks and breakfast and the service and choice was outstanding.

The first night we arrived I rested and went dowstairs to the Casino. I won $1800.00 in total while playing the slots. I tried the next day to go back to it and someone was always on it because that machine was a good machine to win off of., The slots in Caesars are up to date and not out dated games and for that reason is why we decided to stay there again. My Money was not stolen or my bags searched when I was out of the room. I love that place. I would definitely reccomend Caesars Palace for your vacation stay. The rooms are beautiful the bathroom was very pretty with double sinks and a separate toilet room with your own door to close. Loved it. Don't forget to always ask for your free Upgrade too.

At the time of check-in we were offered to upgrade to the new tower for a price of $40 per night, I declined since I figure the rooms are probably just bigger. To my disappointment the rooms are old, small and their idea of 4.5 stars is a phone in the washroom...how outdated is that? The bad: 1. Rooms are outdated, as mentioned you can get a much better room in Aria or Cosmoplitan. 2. I find the dealers there very unprofessional. Perhaps because they have been there for a long time since they all seem to be older. I was quite offended when the dealer and the pit-boss are having a conversation when I am trying to play blackjack. Sorry but I am playing on a $50 per hand table and I expect full attention to card dealing and not mingling with your co-worker. Why would you pause to talk to your pitboss when I double down on a $50 hand?...do your job properly!!! 3. The buffet is not very good compare to say....Planet Hollywood or even Paris. The good: 1. On our last day we always go to the spa and massage since we no longer have the room and it makes it a relaxing day.

The point of staying in the Forum Tower is location. If your preference is for a nicer room, upgrade to Palace, Augustus or (after January 2012) Octavius Towers.

I booked the Forum Tower after reading all the great review, but upon getting there, I was so disappointed by the size of the room. T.V stations sucks, because there's not even HBO, or any movie channels at all. I've always been fascinated by the beauty of Caesar's Palace and it's high image it held, but the Forum Tower room I got was a big disappointment. The only that was cool was the tv in the bathroom mirror, but even that still sucked a bit, because no channels really work except for their 702 channel showcasing their las vegas hotels. Also, it had such horrible reception because the channels were full of statics and was so unclear. The bathroom was very clean though, I will give the bathroom a 5+ because it has double shower head and is super clean. The room decor was mediocre, and I hated that the closet was in the bathroom, but loved that the toilet was separated in its own next room to the bathroom sink and shower. I will say their customer service was superb and is 5+. Everyone was very friendly and nice, and helpful. They were so helpful in switching rooms for me from a one bed to a two bed.

Our view however was terrible as we looked out to the parking garage. Our room was on the 9th floor. Didn't mind too much about the view as we were hardly in the room. The Palace tower was nice and close to the Conference area of the hotel. My last 3 nights I moved rooms into a Classic Room in the Roman Tower. I must admit that I was nervous about this change after reading reviews on line. I was pleasantly surprised. Yes it was not a nice as the Palace room, and the decor was dated, but the room was large, clean and we had a view of the strip. Again we didn't spend much time in the room. This time we were on the 13th floor. The Beijing Noodle 9 restaurant was very good. Not a big fan of the Payard Patisserie & Bistro (small sandwiches big prices). Central restaurant was good. The conference facility is very large and oddly laid out. It took us about 10 minutes from the entry to the conference area to get to our seminar location. This included up escalators, down and around a hall, up some stairs, then down another escalator and then down and around another hall. Would have been nice to have free coffee in our rooms. The coffee in the conference area was terrible, very weak. Overall it was a nice hotel and we feel we received good value for our money.

You get the idea. The newer hotels have addressed some of these issues in the original design (especially Venetian/Palazzo), with parking elevators next to hotel towers, but the present day Caesers was not even imagined when the original hotel opened years ago. Over the past several years and perhaps 20 stays, we have had amazing visits (New Year's Eve 2010-2011 and the parties hosted by the casino/Total Rewards rate a 10+) and some not so great. We have experienced a couple of extraordinary difficult check-ins, as reported by other reviewers, had our booked tower changed upon arrival, and have had to request new bath linens because he ones wer got were old and near threadbare. It is a big hotel that does a basically good job most of the time. As any frequent visitor to Las Vegas can tell you, there are some tricks to navigating large Las Vegas hotels, and once you master them, it is hard to switch hotels and loyalties and start over. As a casino player (and we have hotel comps at the very least at some of the top properties---Wynn, Venetian, etc.) I can say that the hosts are great and the Total Rewards comp system takes out most of the guess work and the old process of \"negotiting the hotel bill at the end\" is a thing of the past at the Harrahs hotels.

My only complaint about bathroom would be it needs more storage space and maybe a vanity with a chair. The casino seemed smokier than some of the newer upscale hotels. The sports book was extremely smoky and crowded on a big college football day. Almost all of the tables are reserved, so get there early if you don't have a reservation. We didn't and my husband went and got a table at 7:30 am. The restaurants that we eat in at Caesars were all pretty good, nothing exceptional. Rao's had a nice atmosphere and our dishes were pretty good. The drink service at the tables and slots, as well as the sports book, was good. We saw the new show at Caesars, Absinthe, and thought it was funny, (R rated.) The Forum shops are convenient and offer a variety of shops from H & M to Versace.

At first we thought the problem was caused by the toilet, but we discovered ourselves that water was dripping from the closet ceiling and ruining the walls, floors and furniture... no one seemed to care. The smell of the water was terrible, making most of the suite stink and us sneeze. Housekeeping took some clothes that had a terrible smell from the dripping water and we never saw them again and no one could locate those clothes when we checked out. No one we spoke to seemed to care and no one offered to move us to another room. My family crammed into the other bedroom for our last night and I slept on the couch.

The palace tower is the only tower located on or close to the pool. I asked upon checkin if there were any rooms with 2 bathrooms available as i was there with my mum, the girl on the desk said she would see what she could do, but there would be a wait as check in was not till around 4pm and this was around 2pm, so to keep checking with reception. So that was fine, we rang the front desk to see if our room was ready from many free hotel phones around every half hour, when they said it was ready we picked up our swipe key and went up. The room was on the 14th floor, overlooking the amazing pool complex. The room did have 2 bathrooms, perfect. That night we went down to thank the receptionist who checked us in but she must of left, so we couldn't tip her. But just shows all you need to do is be polite and ask if there are any upgrades available. :) The room was spotless, with replenished bathroom products. Also had bathrobes-i was there for 2 weeks and asked for a new robe after about the 10th day via hotel note paper left on top of the dirty robe in the bathroom, the new one i got was ripped write across the chest!, I didnt think this was very professional or appropriate, and would of easy been noticed by the maid. The room had a large flatscreen tv, and minibar DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT TOUCHING IT!, DONT EVEN BREATH ON IT YOU WILL BE CHARGED! The only negative about the room was that the air con pumped out cigarette smoke, which you breathed in all night, not good for an asthma sufferer, i left with a bad cough, so it wasnt on much. I had a fridge at an extra charge which was outside the room when we arrived, after the 2nd day the fridge still wasnt cold, it was replaced the next day. The hotel is spotless with around a dozen shops, very expensive though, and not particually my cup of tea, for example cigar shops and watch shops. The forum shops through the casino where much better you could spend a whole day in there. The pool was exceptional, however what i did found was that when guests left they would leave there towels-lazy arses and they would be there all day, so new guests would not know if they were available or not. We always found a space around the venus pool which is a quiet rectangle pool in the corner, as we had a pool view we could see where the spaces were. You could never get a space around the 2 main pools, which were full with people but mostly reserved towels by 10am. These 2 pools were very noisy with music, so i wouldnt of gone there anyway. The venus pool was in the shade by 3.30-4pm that is why not many people went there, but we go up then anyway to that was perfect for us. The first time we went down the pool we ordered 2 slushes, which are like strawberry ice drinks for those who dont no, i think americans call them mr freeze, anyway 2 (non alcholic ones) cost $24!, in walgreens there less than $2 each. Needless to say we didnt bother again and had to smuggle in our own drinks as no food/drinks from the outside world is not allowed, even though there is a little shop just before the entrance to the pool, very odd. Saw Terry Fator, fantastic, CSI the experience and David Spade who had 90% of the same material from when we saw him 2 years ago! Only had one buffet tea in the hotel it was the most expensive one we went to and had the least variety very few dishes. All i had was rice, spring rolls and bread which cost around $25!, no plain ice cream for desert, very disappointing large queue waited bout 30min to get in, but the place was empty. We paid \u00a31300 each for a 2 week stay in the palace tower, with included separate Thomas cook flights (premium)and booking hotel separate, the hotel company has now gone bust though and im not surprised though as the price was unbeatable.

I must say that my review is biased by our initial experience checking in, in which it took us SIX (6) HOURS to check-in. That\u2019s right! When we went to the lobby to check in, we got on a long line, about 20 minutes into waiting on that line, a hotel employee came up to us and the people behind us and told us we had to move to another line since we were on the wrong line. So she moved us to the end of an even longer line. When she left, we moved back to that initial line, since it turns out we were on the right line after all. After another half an hour of waiting, we finally made it to the front counter and were told that our hotel room was being prepared and would be ready in an hour and to come back then. We then went onto a different line to check our luggage so that we could get something to eat. After an hour we went back on line to get our luggage and then went on another long line to get our room key. We were told that our room wasn\u2019t ready yet and they would call us when it was. They didn\u2019t call us for another four more hours after that. In the meantime, my husband had to get ready for his conference and there was no where he could change and they don\u2019t have courtesy rooms, so we had to DRAG all our luggage to the pool restroom. When we finally checked-in and questioned the front desk as to what took so long, we didn\u2019t even get a simple apology. Our room was in the Palace Towers (which is supposed to be one of the nicer towers). I would say our room was just average, although we had a nice big bathroom (almost the size of our room) with a jacuzzi tub. Our view was of a big parking lot and our television was broken. We called up maintenance workers twice, who advised us, it wasn\u2019t even a television but a computer screen with a chip in it and that the chip had died. Talk about CHEAP! What kind of a hotel doesn\u2019t even have real tvs?!? Several people we met who stayed in the Roman Towers said it was very dated, and I can\u2019t imagine what those rooms looked like if our rooms were just okay. Another complaint about this hotel is that it is so large and the signage was very poor so it was very easy to get lost. In terms of food, we ate at three locations at the hotel: 1) a French pastry restaurant which was quite good, 2) a Japanese restaurant (which was not that great), and 3) serendipity (which had a very LARGE and good breakfast but make sure you get there before 11 a.m. or they will stop selling the breakfast menu). The day we went to the pool, it wasn\u2019t warm enough to go in, but it looked nice. The casino at this hotel was the least impressive of all the casinos we visited while in Vegas since it had very low ceilings (making it feel claustrophobic). The best thing this hotel had going for it, was the location in the middle of the strip. If I had a choice of places to stay in Vegas, I would have picked the Venetian hotel, which was much more charming.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cToo Much Hype!\u201d", "Author": "qmask", "ReviewID": "UR119834338", "Content": "This place is way overrated!

If you ask the staff for directions, they will direct you through the casino floor regardless of where you're going, which can be frustrating. The most annoying thing was the food situation! I waited 45 minutes to get fast food (at the food court and at Payard) because these places were so grossly understaffed. You'd think they could hire extra workers when they know there is a conference going on, but apparently not. Also, something as simple as a mediocre slice of pizza and a soda costs $10! A pastry, coffee, and juice for breakfast costs $20! The casinos are designed to make it impossible for you to have time to leave them and get food elsewhere so you're basically their captive. Oh - and DO NOT plan to do anything at the business center. It's $5 just to touch the computer then $1 per page you print! Disgusting! For these reasons, I would give the place 2 stars.

I stayed in the Palace tower, Run of House, which was a 2-double room. The room itself was very spacious and nice. Double sink bathroom with whirlpool and separate shower. Great view of all the pools Caesars has to offer. However, be sure to read all materials provided before brewing a pot of coffee, which has always been complimentary in every other hotel I ever stayed, but cost around $12 for maybe 2-12oz cups. There also was a snack/liquor bar, which is expected in a hotel like this. Of course I also expected to be charged for consuming any of these snacks/liquors, although I didn't. But I didn't realize the sophistication of being charged by just browsing the snacks/liquors. Apparently there is some sort of sensor that automatically charges to your room if you so much as pick up and look at any of the items offered. I guess the time limit is 30 seconds (per hotel staff). We were charged for some of these very overpriced items, but hotel staff was courteous to remove from our bill considering our ignorance of the billing system and the fact that we didn't actually consume any of the items. The hotel itself is pretty nice, I guess. Although hotels of this caliber have the appearance of being trashy when you first walk in and are surrounded by the casino and a thick cloud of smoke. I guess I'm not all that impressed with the decor, although some of it was pretty neat, and we did take lots of pictures. But I found myself wondering, why am I taking pictures of replica statutes. But still, its not something you see in any other hotel. The food was extremely expensive, including the small food court. I'd recommend dining elsewhere. We tried Serendipty (spell?), a very overpriced, busy, and very slow service restaurant within Caesars Palace. The food was fine, but $60 for dinner for two with only 2 alcoholic beverages made it just ok ... definitely not something to write home about. The popular item at the restaurant is a frozen hot chocolate, which we wanted to order, but opted not to given the fact that it would have taken an additional 30 minutes just to be served. I was somewhat shocked when I stopped by the front desk one evening to inquire about the location of the workout facility. The front desk pointed me in the right direction, but also mentioned it cost $25 a day to use the facility. I decided not to use the facility. The hotel connects to an upscale indoor shopping area, which includes the likes of Gucci, Louis Vutton (spell?), True Religion, etc. Overall, navigating the hotel was very difficult. On a positive note, whatever food/liquor you consume you can find comfort in knowing you'll work it off making your way back to your room or some other area of the hotel. A lot of walking was involved. Which is perfectly fine by me, but can also be aggravating when all you want is a decently priced cup of coffee. By comparison to the Balaggio and Vinitian (both Spell?), we liked the Venitian the most. Although it was still very big, the atmosphere was much more comfortable and seemed even nicer. I should point out, we didn't go to Las Vegas to gamble, we were there for a business convention, so I can't comment on any of the gambling here.

I told him we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary, asked if the room had a good \"view\" and I was told UP FRONT: \"No, we are booked and this is the best we have but you are not gonna like it.\" Well, needless to say, we were in Forum Tower, Room 5210 and the City View I paid for was a view of the back wall of the Colliseum and the rooftop of the Casino. NO I DID NOT LIKE IT!!! While we went on to our room the others in my party were checking in and as LUCK would have it, they were placed in rooms on the 64, 67 and 68th floors. AND GUESS WHAT.....THEY ALL HAD A CITY VIEW! I guess it sounds like sour grapes but we all booked at the same time, checked in at the same time, PAID THE SAME FEES and were not given the \"same\" room status. Anyway, after my friends saw the difference in our \"VIEWS\" we all went back to the front desk to see what happened and we were told, nicely, that they were booked and I could not be moved. Also, Douglas, another front desk guy, told us that a City View in the Forum Tower was rare and not many guests could get it. SURPRISE, SURPRISE!! Three out of the four couples that registered got the RARE City View. Hmmm. Then I was told that after checkout on Sunday, if there was a room available they would \"gladly upgrade us\". Thought I had already upgraded??? The call to my room for the upgrade NEVER came and when I checked back the next evening I was told again.....Sorry....well yes it was sorry!! The room was comfortable, bed was good, hair dryer worked, we brought our own Keureg (?) coffee to use in their coffee maker (took 3 days to get new coffee cups though). We had a good time with our friends and wanted to make the best of the situation. I was just very disappointed that Ceasars did not seem to care where we were roomwise and no one contacted me the entire duration of our stay. They knew the room number!! If you stay in the Forum tower, you need the higher floor!! OH, BTY, NO ONE IN OUR PARTY DID THE TIP THING FOR AN UPGRADE!!!

Slots were tight and the server only came by one time during 45 mins of playing, she said she was busy and would be with us in a little while. We just cashed out and left.

After making me feel like I was a total nuisance, the manager relented and told me he would honor the price I was quoted with one catch. We would have to switch rooms. As it turned out not only did we have to move to another room but also to a completely different tower. We were moved from the Augustas Tower to the Roman Tower which is basically a Holiday Inn. The room was horrible and we paid the same rate that we had been paying for the extremely nice room. On top of that housekeeping didn't even clean our room on one of the days of our stay. When we arrived back and called the front desk they acted annoyed and asked me if I wanted it cleaned then. It was 9:00 pm so I declined but they're attitude was terrible.

Water temp problem. Hot shower NOT available at nite after 9pm. Stained dirty carpet. 80s CRT TV. If you want 2 star-worth motel quality room at a 4 star hotel price, be my guest, Caesar will deliver it. My husband was attending a wk-long conference at the Caesar palace. They offered a standard room to us at a special rate of $190 which made it an apparent choice for the stay. We didn't have much expectation as we knew it is going to be a standard room after all. But as an acclaimed 4 star hotel in Vegas, we expect their most basic room quality to be, if not above standard, at least decent. The hotel is big and glamorous from the strip but that's all. All hell breaks loose once you check in. At first they checked us into a room on the 5th flr in the Roman tower right next to service elevators which was so noisy that we demanded a room change right a way. This time they switched us to another room on a higher floor on the 14th in the same tower. To our pleasant surprise, they are thoughtful enough to provide, not 1 but 2 shower caps, vanity kit (2 cotton balls, few Q tips, a rubber band), sewing kit. It has a walkin shower with 2 weaker-than-your-home shower heads, mini TV in the washroom, light shutout blinds, a safe, weak but working hairdryer, but no tub, no bathrobe, no slipper - o well, no big deal; but the lack of a fridge, coffee/ tea, coffee marker and 80s CRT TV just are not acceptable by today's standard. Even a 3star Hilton std rm has them. The sluggish in-rm wifi costs you as much as $14.99 per day and is only applicable to 1 device.. But here comes the WORST part - we tried to take a shower at 11pm. And guess what, the water came out of shower at the max hottest setting was COLD. It was so cold that it generated absolutely NO steam at all. We let it ran for 5min at the max but still no change. While we were half dripping wet, it took us 4 calls to the front desk, every 10mins before a rather handyman-looking \"engineer\" showed up at our room. He looked at the shower and was not all surprised, and said the most ridicious thing i have ever heard, \"sometimes the water temperature does drop thru out the night. It takes time to pump hot water to this (14th) floor. Just wait and let it run for 5-10mins until the temperature is ok for shower.\". What?! Are you kidding?!!! This is NOT a Motel 8!! We just couldn't believe our ears! At the end we had to let it run at max setting for as long as 10mins before the water got warm enough to shower (yes, still NOT hot!). Obviously this boiler / water temp issue is a known problem to them. Possibly this is some lowlife hotel management's idea to keep the boiler off as much as possible or they are just too cheap get a new / additional boilers, at just to save money. We called to complain but receive no compensation or treatment of any kind. The hotel management should have offered us another room, or even a free upgrade, instead of having this problem dragged on for 1 whole hour and produce some very unhappy customers. Plus their crappy, non-existent service, impolite, unfriendly, useless staff - this is just plainly ridiculous for a 4 star hotel and is a total rip off. Others had mentioned how filthy the carpet. I watched them serviced my room on 3 separate days. For some reasons their maids are trained to vacuum the carpet ONLY at the spot beside the bed but no where else. Why they were trained not to vacuum the entire room is beyond me. May be another brilliant penny-pinching measure from another management folk?! Regarding noise from the club, we could still hear some faint thumping disco every night from 1 till 4am in the morning. But the noise level was within acceptable limit as we are heavy sleepers. Cannot imagine how is it like for lower levels. 99% of the sitdown restaurants in Caesar is criminally over-priced just like anywhere else in vegas but not necessary good quality, unless you live on food court food. The Cheese Cake factory in the Forum shop is actually a gem. Price is reasonable for a sitdown restaurant. Speed is efficient. Food quality ax the board is consistent and is above and beyond other restaurants in the same franchise. We like their salmon lunch special (miso, simply grilled) so much that we went there almost for every day we stayed here. Conclusion: Shame on you Caesar Palace.

If you are going to get a room a the Caesars Palace hotel check whether there is any on-going construction before you book. We did enjoy going to Caesars Palace nightclub 'Pure' which has it own roof top bar over looking the strip. It was one of our favourite clubs in Vegas and was heaving on a Friday and Saturday night. If you are staying at the hotel then you get free entry. The conceriege also booked our helicopter trip over the Grand Canyon which was one of my highlights of the stay. All in all this hotel was pretty much what we expected, and I said you don't spend much time in the room so anywhere you book on the Strip will be fab. Other advice, we went to see the 'O' show at the Ballagio which was brilliant, the Grand Canyon helicopter trip is a must, (book through information at Caesars) we had dinner at the Mandalay Bay Hotel which was very nice and Tao nightclub (at the Venitian) and XS (at the Wynn) were also good clubs.

With such a great facility, I expect excellent customer service. That was not the case. We had reserved a room for 2 nights. Before we arrived, we received an email asking if we'd like to upgrade our room at a discounted rate. I called to ask about the amenities in the upgraded room. I would have passed on most of the upgrade, but when I heard that we'd have a Jacuzzi tub and an extra sink, I felt like the upgrade was worth it. When we checked in, we were given a room for a handicapped person. There was no tub. The shower was very handicap friendly - no door, a wand instead of a showerhead. There was only one sink in the bathroom. I called the front desk to ask about our room. They told us that we were in a deluxe room like we had requested. I mentioned the amenities that I was expecting, and they told us that the larger size room made it qualify as a deluxe room. The room was very large, but I had no need for all the floor space. I just needed a place to sleep. She told me that they were sold out and there was no way that they could give me another room. I asked if there was something available for the next night, and she said I'd have to call back the next day and ask. When I asked the next day, they found a room for me. They told me to pack my belongings and wait in the room until someone arrived. They might not arrive for 2 hours. Eventually she agreed to an upgraded room change where we wouldn't have to be there when our belongings were moved. All in all, I was very frustrated with the service.

First thing: we entered the wrong code into the safe. Our fault, but at 9 am we asked them to send an engineer to open the safe so that we may have access ot our belongings. At 1:45 pm we still did not have access to our belongings. We had to make a second and third request to get the safe open. When help arrived they were b@@ching at us about not receiving the order. That is an internal problem that a guest should not have to listen to. Nevertheless we had to smile and pretend that life was great so that they could stop b@@ching and do their job. Gee whiz, now I have to play mediator between the staff and management. That is outrageous. Five hours after later we have our purses. yeah! Second huge problem: horrible, horrible, horrible, service at my cabana. We rented the cabana for $500 dollars and were committed to ordering $1000 in food and drinks. $1500 to have a tent by a pool. ok. There were 10 of us so that will not be a problem. The problem is we could only order service from the deisgnated cabana boys or waitress, none of which were available. Our waitress showed up an hour late because she was confused with what time her shift started. The Cabana boys were available the first hour before they disappeared. We waited to order food and drinks one whole hour before I walked around to find a manager. The manager promised to handle the situation and comp. a round of drink and to restock our refridg with water. ok, all is well..maybe not. The waitress finally arrived and waited on us only to get the order wrong!! It was an additional 45 min before I received what I wanted. In addition, our drinks were never removed from our bill! Also, the water arrived in a case and the waiter needed to be told to put the water in ther refrig. He looked at us as if to ask where do you want this hot case of water to go. It is 97 degrees F, you tell me where you think it should go! If guests are required to purchase 1 grand of food and beverages and order directly from the staff then we should have dedicated staff for the cabana. Instead the staff was servicing the cabana and the rest of the 2 pools. An additional waitress came to assist us around 4 pm (we have been at the pool for 7 hours at this time) only to roll her eyes before asking if we needed help and explain that she knew our waitress was swamped and needed assistance, but management just gave her the ok. Again, internal problems, not mine. Overall, I expected a higher level of service from CP. This service along with the customer service at the pool, will make me consider other properties!

Our TV remote didn't work, but we didn't care enough about it to let them know. Who watches TV while you are in Vegas anyway! Except for the last day we were there, it was very quiet on our floor. It wasn't a big deal or the hotel's fault, but the people in the room next to us sounded like it was full of people talking very loudly. Annoying, but not the hotel's fault. I guess if someone is being really loud in their room, you might hear it. We had easy access to the pool (pool entrance right off Palace Tower) and casino floor. Also to the conference centers. Caesars is huge, therefore it's not like you'll be close to everything, but we didn't find any problems getting anywhere. I shopped, ate at the restaturants, used the pool, had a massage at the spa and gambled. Everything was wonderful. Pool: There are a few pools, but I just laid out by the one directly out the door from Palace Towers. I went once in the morning and once in the afternoon. No problems finding a lounge chair either day. Pool was very relaxing. Spa: I had a swedish massage and used the \"snow room\" and steam room while I was there. You could use the facilities all day long and come back to use them or use the gym. Gambling: The casinos at Caesars are very fancy to look at and very large and spacious. They have great bars where you can get a lot of different kinds of beers that can't be found everyone else. We play slots and there is a good choice of machines. Downside- slots seem very tight at Caesars. Seemed I had better luck at New York/New York and the Palazzo. Waitstaff = very friendly. Some days we had no problems getting served, other days there wasn't a waitress to be found on the floor it seemed. I think because the casino is so huge there seems to be some \"dead spots\" in it as far as service for free cocktails Restaurants: We ate at Spago twice for lunch and Mesa Grill once for dinner. Spago is in the Forum Shops. It's great because you can sit and people watch. Service is incrediable, food is great. Mesa Grill was overpriced for what you get.

Since then, I've stayed there many, many times along with a wide variety of other places, all of which offered casinos as well as rooms. Years ago, I used to stay at non-Harrah's group properties, but since joining the Total Rewards program, I found the benefits so valuable, I simply stay at one of their properties. Harrah's owns quite a few casino-hotels around the U.S. and many in Vegas, not all of which are as nice as Caesar's. For a complete listing, go to www.Harrah's.com, which also explains the benefits available to gamblers who join the program; the more one gambles (puts at risk of loss), the greater the benefits. For anyone who views gambling as sinful or undesirable, they should avoid staying at a casino-hotel in the first place as that activity is unavoidable. This review is not to promote gambling, but rather only to point out to those interested in it, the substantial side benefits available to participants. Harrah's and most \"gaming\" enterprises, as those businesses call themselves, also counsel their customers not to put at risk any funds which one's financial circumstances should not be affordable as entertainment value.

We booked our room 3 months ago, directly with the hotel. After reading a lot of reviews I asked the lady at the phone to book my room only if they had availability in Augustus Tower. She told me that it was OK so I booked a Premium room with Bellagio View. We arrived at the hotel at about 10 am but the lady at the front desk told us that we cannot make the check in before 3 pm. (The front desk at the time was totally empty). Anyway, I asked her at least to check our reservation, to verify that everything was OK. She agreed, but she was not pleasant, and then she told me that we had a reservation at ROMAN Tower. I had a prepay reservation (total 1.800$) for Augustus Tower when a room in ROMAN Tower costs about 800 $ for the same nights. She tried to tell me that when you book a room at Ceasars they could give you room in any available Tower. If this is the case then, I believe that all the rooms should have the same price. We were very tired, after a 30 hours trip from Europe, but I was no ready to accept that attitude, so I asked for the manager. She came after 30 minutes, she checked the computer and she told me That they were fully booked and they have room only in ROMAN Tower. At that moment I remembered the reviews from TripAdvisor about the 20 $ tip and I slept to her a 20 $ and Oh my God!! She just found a nice room for us in Augustus Tower with Bellagio view. This is totally unacceptable from a hotel with this reputation, like you are in a hotel in Congo. Anyway we went to our room, which was nice, and we asked for our luggages. They arrived and two of them were broken, one very bad. We complaint to the front desk. He ask if we wanted to file a complaint with the security and when the inspector arrives, after a week, he will make an investigation to find out who did it. I found this very nice us a jock so we did nothing, we just decided to never stay at Ceasars again. The whole week we stayed there we did not see security at all. Even late at night nobody checked keys at the elevators, us they do at other hotels. This hotel is full of Prostitutes and they do nothing about it. We stayed at MIRAGE next week and we did not pass the elevator once without checking our keys by the security. Last but not least we had their TOTAL REWARDS Card. We spend, during our stay, about 2.000 -3.000$ at the Casino. The night before we leave we asked if we have some rewards and OUAOU!! my husband had 6$ and I had 3$ reward. We spend half the money when we stayed at Treasure Island and our rewards were about 160$ from food and 2 nights free of charge.

Our night started by standing at the front desk for 20 minutes waiting to check in behind a family only to be told once we stepped up that the hotel clerk's shift was over. Wow thanks for letting me stand here and waste my time in this line only to have to go and wait in another one. Then when we finally start to check in we are quoted room prices that are $30 more per night than what was confirmed in an email. Luckily we had the email on hand and they corrected it, but it left a bad taste in my mouth like I was being scammed. Our first night we stayed in the Roman tower which must be one of the oldest because it was very outdated. It was clean but very run down, you had to pay to use the safe (????). I would have said that it reminded me of a Motel 6, the bathroom tub was chipped, the room was small, I mean we could have saved a $100 and stayed across the street at Imperial. However, one of our friends requested an upgrade and Caesar's did accommodate us (YEAH!!) which was extremely nice of them but appropriate as well, and the new room in the Palace tower was awesome, and what I felt was more on par with a nice hotel in Vegas. We booked the Mesa Grill through the Caesar's booking company for a party of 12 several months in advance even calling the week before our trip to confirm the reservation. We booked for Friday night, we get a late voicemail (due to flying) on Thursday that they were expecting us that night. Friday morning we called to sort the reservation out and sure enough they made a mistake and got the reservation wrong. So now we have no reservation for Mesa Grill, it's Friday morning and we have to come up with a place for 12 people to eat dinner Friday night. So instead of creating a reservation for us at Mesa Grill we were told that the only place that would take us is Nero's. I'm sorry but if I have a reservation for 12 people booked months in advance and you screw it up at least buy me a bottle of wine, especially if I'm forced to go somewhere I don't really want to out of desperation. So the next day I had a cabana reserved at the pool for my party. We were told to get there at 9am to confirm and hold the cabana, which we did. We waited an hour and a half to order our first drink because one of the cocktail waitresses called in, and the other thought her shift started an hour later. What are we on island time or something? I didn't get the memo. We were told we were not allowed to order at the bar because they can't transfer it to the cabana...whatever... basically we pay over a $1000 for cabana service to stand around for 2 hours waiting on a waitress to order a drink when we could have spent nothing and gotten the drinks ourselves. Our cabana got restocked once but we were there for around 6 hours and no one took out the trash or cleaned up any old cups. Oh and we stupidly locked ourselves out of our safe and it took someone 3 hours to get there and open it in 3 seconds. Really? I expected a lot more from Caesar's, the location is prime, but I think it's gotten too big to give exceptional service to the number of guests that stay there, and they are charging way too much for terrible service. For the same price there are many other options on the strip, and I will not give any more of my money to Caesar's Palace.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cNot As Grand As Imagined\u201d", "Author": "cuetxpie", "ReviewID": "UR118331845", "Content": "This review is for the hotel & pool only (excluding the Forum and casino floors): We got a comp room in the Forum Tower.

This was actually a last minute switch, as we were originally scheduled to go to New Orleans on Labor Day. My mind (and taste buds) were already salivating over Oysters, Crawdads and Beignets. Unfortunately, there was a storm named Lee which sprung up suddenly in the Gulf and was due to hit New Orleans the day we arrived. No thank you. Eating the foods of the Gods is one thing, doing it under 10\" of rain, quite another. Fortunately, our travel agent was able to make the switch, get us great airfare and a good deal at Caesars. ***I have always tried to make travel arrangements myself, figuring that I could always get a better deal. This trip taught me a great lesson. Only a good agent would have been able to make this switch and save a vacation. We use AMEX Travel and it pays...in more than one way. We arrived in Vegas the day before Labor Day and was greeted with a temperature of 104. Low humidity? Right. It's hot. Don't let anyone tell you different. In fact, the thermometer went below 100 only once during our stay. I was so glad I brought my Shearling.. :). Anyway, during our check-in, we found out that we could up-grade our room for only $30/day. This would be a room almost doubled in size. I negotiated the rate down to $20/day. Tip - Always, always try to get the price lower. The only thing they can say is no. I saved $70.00 by doing this, which went towards a great lunch at Bobby Flay's restaurant. The room was great...However, the bed was not a King as we were told. Well, in their eyes it was a King, but not ours. We were, however, able to change to another room with 2 Queens and a double bathroom. Hmm. Maybe I should have complained again and we could have gotten a suite. No...This was fine. You have to learn when to push it and when to stay quiet. The room also had a nice sized flat screen T.V. (important to us). If you're not into walking...do yourself a favor and don't stay here (or at any Hotel/Casino on the strip. Caesars was huge..I mean it was a 1/4 mile walk from the room to the Casino. But I have to tell you that my wife and I were impressed. The place was great. The staff were helpful and aimed to please. I have a bad back and leg and after walking through a number of shopping places, I couldn't get back all the way to my room. Within 5 minutes, a security guard arrived with a wheelchair and took me all the way to the room. I don't care if it has wheels or not; I not a small guy and this was a workout for the guard. But he was very personable, chatted up a storm and was concerned that I was able to get out of the chair and into the room. Was my wife upset? No...She was off to the penny slots. All of the Hotels have their own shopping malls, but the Forum shops at Caesars took it to another level. The stores were all high quality, interesting and well laid out. Yes, it was another walking marathon, but it was well worth it. Are the prices discounted? Of course not...But trust me. The Forum is great to walk through even though you don't purchase anything. Again, every Hotel has its' own celebrity restaurants and Caesars was no exception. Once again, the prices were high (well, very high) but the portions were mammouth and we ended up sharing just one entree and we were stuffed. You can't take it with you so it's a great idea to share. Lowers the price and gives you the opportunity to dine at great places. Also, we're not gamblers..thank God...We paid for everything which is just fine. I don't have to lose $1,000.00 and get a dinner on them, thank you very much. We lucked out in that it was Restaurant Week and every celebrity place had its' own special. At Mesa, we were able to have a price fixed lunch for $30/person. It was fabulous and we were not hungry for the rest of the day. Another meal found us at Beijing 9, a small place right off the Casino. The decor was very pleasing...large aquarium tanks filled with goldfish. They also made their own noodles out in the open. Quite entertaining. No review of a Vegas hotel is complete without talking about the Casino. Again, we are not gamblers, but we do love to play the penny slots. Caesars had at least two different Casinos which were loaded with penny slots. We only wagered $.40 per spin and were able to play a couple of hours each time we sat down. Yes, we won. Not a lot, but at least $15-20 per day. What a great time. We budgeted ourselves to no more than $20 per machine. If we lost, we went to another. I didn't realize this but coins are no longer used. When you're done and cash out, they print you a ticket which you can later exchange for money at a certain machine, or use to play again. During our stay, we never cashed out a ticket, but waited until the day we left. It was kind of a game for us to see how much we could accumulate. Oh yeah...Don't forget to take out all of your tickets at the end. On the way to the airport, my wife discovered a $20 ticket that was in her pocketbook. Fortunately, the cabbie was kind enough to take the ticket in lieu of cash..But what a tip she was left. Finally, know this. Las Vegas is just not about the Strip. We rented a car for a couple of days and had a fantastic time driving around. We went to Hoover Dam and drove through Red Rock Canyon. We even went down to the Pawn Shop that is featured in Pawn Stars (what a disappointment that place was.) Renting the car was a great idea. There is a lot to see outside of the Strip and it breaks up the monotony of going from one Casino to the next. We stayed for one week and never thought that we were bored.

Caesars is in an execellent location and actually contains enough variety in resaurants, shops (above and below ground), casino space, clubs, etc that you almost have no need to leave the Palace.

With its Roman columns, statues and fountains all colored in gold and white with clear blue waters, it is without a doubt the hotels centerpiece. This is where we spent most of our daylight hours. And the weather was perfect! And if you are feeling a bit more daring, there is the adult-only, European-style Venus Pool. We loved this pool! For the most part it was quiet and very relaxing.

We spent the week (sept. 3rd - 10th) at the Cesaer's Palace. Check-in: The check-in process is very simple and fast. Once you gave your credit card and basic information, they will give you your room keys and direction to the proper towers. Speaking of finding your tower, be prepare for a good walk! Room: We were staying in the Palace tower on the 19th floor with a view on the pools. There are 5 pools, including a more private/adult one called Venus. The size of the room is very nice with all the commodities you can want. The bathroom is very large with a shower big enough for two. You have to be very careful with the minibar as it is electronically connected to your room number for any charges. In another way, as soon as you remove something from the shelf, the charge is instant. Restaurants: There are so many of them scatter everywhere. There is a huge buffet open until late in the evening, many small coffee shops, specialty restaurants for all the tastes. In any case you don't find what you're looking for, you can cross the streets and go the any other ones found in others hotels. Prices ranges from cheap to extremely expensive. Location: The Cesaer's Palace is nicely located in the middle of the strip. You have an almost direct access to the Bellagio, Bally, Mirage and Flamingo. In a walking distance, you can get to the Monorail that goes between the MGM and the old Sahara. There is also two buses that stops in front of the hotel. Even if there are many options for going from place to place (taxi, bus, tram and monorail), bring a good pair of walking shoes. Even if you know you'll be walking, it's nothing compare to what you'll really do. With the monorail, tram and bus you can purchase a 3 days pass (24hrs day) which is really useful to go around. Shopping: Are you ready to spend some money? If the answer is yes, you have a direct access to the Forum Shops with more than 160 boutiques. The Fashion Show Mall is just minutes away from the hotel. Casino: the only thing I can say is you'll find and available spot 24/7. When playing, the drinks are free and delivered by a very fast personnel. For the smoking people, this is allowed in the casino's sections only. Nightlife: Las Vegas is the city that never sleep. Nightclubs, bars and lounges are found everywhere and the usual crouwd. Some of the bars are open 24hrs. If you thinking about attending some of the numerous shows in the evening, allow a minimum of 1 hour to get there; people and traffic will slow you down.

Used the quick take-away food stands next to the casino several times. A bit pricey but good portion size so we could share. Didn't use the pool, spa or gym. The internet rates are outrageous. Needed to use it in both the convention area and the room and $25 for each device is highway robbery! Found a couple of lucky machines in the casino. Great bar service at the piano bar. We've stayed at Caesars about half dozen times over the years. Used to love it more but now really don't like the very smoky atmosphere and impersonal service.

We stayed 4 nights in late August for the annual meetings of the American Sociological Association, so the place was crawling with our friends and colleagues, and we were mostly working day and night. Having read reviews here I was somewhat concerned about what our \"run of the house\" ($100-$150) room would be like, but there was little to fear: even in the Plebeian (err, Forum?) Tower, which I understand is not particularly new or updated (corrections, anyone?) the room was quite lovely, spacious, and worked well. It was perfectly clean and fresh, quiet enough (some young folks across the hall), and offered a view of the Mirage as seen over some nearby rooftops. (I think we were on the 11th floor.) Service was superb--everyone from parking to security was as friendly and helpful as possible. Really. The conference organizers cut some deal with the hotel to bundle internet and fitness room costs, but the letter describing the deal was ambiguous and 3 staff attempting to explain it gave 3 different stories. In the end we got a good deal and were happy. Food was quite expensive. Someone (here? Frommer's?) recommended the breakfast buffet at Payard (the in-house, French-style coffee house) BUT I do NOT recommend it. Great coffee, and the pastries are excellent, but the $22 buffet was a poor deal--VERY little food. My best recommendations are to buy your coffee at Payard (NOT at the little coffee place in the food court near the Forum Tower elevators--that stuff is very weak but costs $4). For lunch, however, the salad bar in the food court is great: one a slip of paper choose some basic greens and add any of a wide range of mix-ins, choose a dressing, and for about $10 someone will mix it and toss it and hand it to you--healthy, refreshing, and nicely priced (by Caesar's standards). Bottom line: Caesar's is iconic and huge, impressively warm and caring staff, clean and neat and a bit more. Not cheap. Oh, security on entry to the pools was obnoxious--basically, nothing from outside is allowed inside--buy on site. But the pools themselves are elegant, in the Caesar's over-the-top sort of way. We'd probably stay again, but will likely try THE Hotel, Bellagio, and Four Seasons before we do.

We tried the tip trick as mentioned by other reviewers and it WORKED!!! We arrived about 11:30am, there was a short line (one person in front of us), I tried to find the friendliest face available. We walked up to the counter went through the standard lines then offered a tip with our credit card and id, and politely asked if there were any Complimentary room upgrades. This is key folks, I've read on here sometimes when people ask for an upgrade they say that you can get an upgrade but at a price, the tip I found useful said to say \"COMPLIMENTARY\", and it worked for us. Our clerk really had to work hard to get us the upgrade as she typed away on her computer vigorously then had to make a phone call but it all worked out. We got an amazing room in the Augustus Tower on the 36th floor with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains and part of the south strip. The whole checking in process only took about 15min. Housekeeping was great, always came by and gave us new towels and shampoo and conditioner etc. if we were running low, they were very quick we left for breakfast and came back just an hour or so later and the room had been done up already, very impressed. We took advantage of the buffet of buffet's deal, if you are a total rewards member it's like $45 for 24hrs access to all 7 Harrah's buffets on the strip. If you time it right you can get 4 meals out of it which makes each meal less then $12 bucks in Vegas that's a real bargain. This is the order in which I would recommend the buffets, Rio #1, Planet Hollywood #2, Paris #3(however for breakfast #1), The buffet in Caesars is no good, it's ok but not good, compared to the others it's terrible, I wouldn't recommend it except for convenience. Also ate at Mesa Grill, very good, we've been to Mesa 4 times now and it never disappoints, we ate at Rao too, the food was great, the service was not so good. Munch Bar was good for late night snacks pretty reasonable considering it's hotel prices and my husband and I just shared a snack which was the perfect size for the both of us. There were a lot of comments about the cocktails at the pool and how they had the best mojitos but that was not the experience I had they were way over priced and I was not wowed by them at all, Tao over in the Venetian had the BEST cocktails I had while in Vegas, just FYI. Oh and there have been some reviews about not getting access to the pools unless you go through security that was not my experience you can walk right in and in fact I even walked in with my beer from the casino and no on stopped me.

This was my first time staying at Caesars Palace which should be renamed Caesars Dump. I was very excited to be staying here, considering its history and it is a staple hotel in Las Vegas. I was bitterly disappointed. Unfortunately when we booked we unknowingly booked a classic room which means Roman Tower. It is disgusting, when you walk down the hall, it reeks, like cigarettes, mold, and possibly throw-up. The Roman Tower has a creepy old musty feel. Def not something you would expect at this sort of hotel. I\u2019m hoping the other towers are better but due to my experience on this trip I would rather sleep in a sleeping bag on the strip than to stay at this hotel. I did read the reviews on the Roman Tower but thought people were exaggerating. THEY WERE NOT!!!. Our room was quite big, but I would have taken a room half the size as long as it was newer, cleaner and the bathroom didn\u2019t leak water and the toilet always flushed. Yes that is what we dealt with. Probably the best part is when we saw a cricket or some sort of bug casually making its way across the carpet. 5 star indeed!!! Upon check in we were offered a room at the Roman Tower or Forum Tower which wouldn\u2019t be ready until 4-6. We decided to take a look at the Roman Tower room which was available right away. The second we walking in we called the front desk and said we would happily wait for the Forum Tower, We were told that the Forum Towers was sold out, literally we left the desk 7 mins before that, and now they were sold out???????????? It appears our check in clerk made an error in quoting us the Forum Tower. Management apologized and said there was nothing they could do, perhaps we could talk to the desk clerk, which we did and his response was Sorry it was miscommunication. We then called and asked to be upgraded to any other room, any other tower at any price. Apparently ALL of Caesars was sold out in every other tower for that night. But we could be moved the next morning to the Palace Tower at an additional upgrade cost. We happily accepted because we could not handle that ugly room. She said everything was set all we had to do was go down to the check in desk between 11-1 and say we had a room change and it was all taken care of. The next morning I called and was told that unfortunately they had nothing available because they were completely sold out AGAIN until the Tuesday (we checked out on Monday). I found this hard to believe considering 10 hours earlier we had our choice of whatever tower we wanted at a cost. She then went on to apologize for the miscommunication. I think Caesars needs to look up the definition of that word; miscommunication is not when you say/promise to do one thing and then change your mind. In this industry that is called POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. I will never ever stay at this hotel again and I recommend to all travelers\u2019 pick a different hotel! Planet Hollywood is nearby, cheaper, better rooms and their customer service is 100 times better. You would think with a hotel of this apparent caliber they would have better customer service! Only good thing I can say is that their pool is extremely nice. I actually went out and slept by the pool during the day because I couldn\u2019t stand sleeping in the room. Even for the price it is not worth it!!! The Venetian; amazing, Wynn: amazing. Even my stay at Treasure Island was 1000 times better and they aren\u2019t even rated as high.

Our family of two booked a classic room and got it. The other two families each booked a classic room but got upgraded by paying a $20 \"tip\" (bribery fee) to the reception guy - the rooms they got were even nicer (bigger and nicer view) than the deluxe room one family had to pay an extra over $200 for. Our family had requested a complimentary upgrade at check-in immediately BEFORE the two families who \"tipped\" the receptionist but was told that no rooms other than a smoking one (we required non-smoking) was available. We thus turned it down. But the two families who \"tipped\" (bribed) who checked in right AFTER we did each got a non-smoking, even better than deluxe room with a nice view. We tried talking to the reception people again but were again told there was \"no room\" available for upgrade, bla bla, bla... of course, we knew the reception girl was waiting for the $20 \"tip\". Disgraceful! Upon return to hometown and after talking to other people, we were told that the $20 trick \"always\" works with the reception at check-in. What a disgrace to the hotel industry and how unfair it is for guests who \"honestly\" pay an upgrade fee at booking but who end up having a room not even as nice as the ones offered by staff for FREE to people who \"tip\" (bribe)! When we were once again told that there was no room available for upgrade, we requested a coffee-maker and a mini fridge for our room. We were simply told that there was NONE available except for a fee - even though the outside temperature was like 45C!!! One more note: this hotel is such a money grabber that for rooms with the snacks and mini fridge, if you PICK UP the snacks from the tray or the drinks in the fridge for 20 seconds or more, the hotel would CHARGE the room as if the food/drink has been consumed! In short, poor service by the staff unless you tip e.g. we asked for extra bath towels (only two were provided in the room) but none was given until the next morning when they see a \"tip\" left in the room for housekeeping!

I think that the conference organizers must get a deal on their own rates, by pushing us to the expensive rates. The room was AWESOME! It had a jacuzzi tub, separate shower, couch, dining table for two, and the room was big! I was pretty TICKED that I couldn't even use the treadmill UNLESS I PAID $25/DAY, YES, PER DAY, TO USE THEIR FREAKING TREADMILL! It is in the \"spa\".

A friend of mine, a petite young gal, ran on the road that runs along I-15, but she got spooked for some reason, and later decided to just run up and down the stairs. [I'm glad that she told me on the last day, so she didn't ruin my excuse] I only had the afternoon of my first day to hit the pool, which looked great. It was RIDICULOUS! They stuffed the lounge chairs in loooooong rows, literally touching each other. I found a place to lounge and soak up the sun and 106 degree direct sunshine, when people moved into the lounge chairs next to mine. I suppose that I would give it 5-stars if my neighbors were Vegas showgirls or something, but they weren't and one spilled over into my lounge chair. You had to crawl in and out, at that point! If you had a drink, you had no place to put it. I suspect that it was all to pressure you to RENT one of their lounge pads or cabanas [I didn't even ask the price]. $15 for a pot of coffee you make yourself [I was told], and $15/day for internet, man did they \"nickel and dime\" you... although I think that phrase has long since gone the way of the Edsel. They had mobile check-in and check-out which made getting in and out easy. When you do a mobile check-in, you pick up the key at the Bell Station. The surly bellhop basically just shoved me the key and waved in a general direction of the elevator, which was actually fine with me, my hand with the tip money in it stayed in my pocket.

We prepared for this trip months in advance and, after reading reviews online I was not expecting much. We booked a Forum Tower room for 5 nights comped via Total Rewards, which is a renovated tower, but like many others on here, upon check-in we didn't get the room we booked, we were put in the Centurion Tower, which I didn't even know they had it because it doesn't show up on their booking system. Check-in was smooth, on a Wednesday at around 10:30pm, no lines at all and the staff member was friendly, but he didn't tell us up front that we weren't getting the room we booked, only after the did the check-in and I asked if we got a room at the Forum Tower he said no. I had call Caesars a few days before and expressed my concerns about not getting the room and confirmed that we were definitely coming and yes I understand that the reservation and room types are not a guaranteed, but there are way too many bad reviews for them on this topic, considering that they are supposed to be a 5 star hotel. Anyway, the Centurion Tower was well located, right next to the main casino floor, a very short walk, which was nice. It was also the tower that had access to the Penthouse, the middle elevator was private and had a security guard outside of it. One thing we were very surprised was that the Centurion Tower didn\u2019t have an ice machine! That\u2019s right, no ice machine in any floor and we discovered from a staff member that we had to call room service for ice, which we did and it took just over 30 minutes to get a small bucket of ice; it was at around 11:30pm (I know it was late at night), the staff member apologized for the delay and said that it shouldn\u2019t have taken that long. When we came back to the room after being out for the night, there was a message at the answering machine apologizing again, it was timed at 2am, it was nice of them but good thing we weren\u2019t in the room sleeping, otherwise that would have been another inconvenience. The room was average and not what we would expect from Caesars, not to be negative but like I said, I had already lowered my expectations. Nothing special in the room, there was a couch which we took a look behind it and it was all dirty and dusty. The room was very damp, had an old tube style tv (which is no big deal since we are not in Vegas to watch tv anyway, but it does add to the look and style of the room), the bathroom had some mold in the shower and the shower handle was half broken, other than that everything else in the bathroom was fine and clean. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were very clean. The casino was large and well ventilated (we are non smokers and, as much as we love Vegas, sometimes the smoke can get to us), great location next to the Forum Shops, if you like to shop at expensive and brand name stores this is the place for you! Caesars has a food market which had some good food options and you will also find more options around the Forum Shops. The Market buffet at Caesars was very disappointing; we bought the 24 hours TR buffet deal once and I was looking forward to try out the buffet there but will not go back; good thing we didn\u2019t pay regular price, it is expensive and the food options (very few) and quality were not desirable. We enjoyed other TR properties buffets, like Paris and Planet Hollywood, waaaaaaay nicer! The pool area is beautiful as you can see from the pictures, very classy!

If they would just go ahead and give people their rooms when they arrived a bit early rather then making them wait in a long line they would likely have happier customers.

I've stayed at the Venetian and the Luxor in the past. This trip was for a conference and we wanted to stay at the conference hotel. The room was in the older \"towers\" section so expectations were low. It was a really odd room. It seemed like there was missing furniture. One corner was obviously missing a chair or something large and there were extension cords strewn about. On the cords, my beside table had a lamp that had a cord that ran alllll the way down the wall next to me to get AC power. The room was tacky-looking because of all these weird cords running everywhere. The bed was comfortable and clean. The floor carpet was completely wet on the other side of the bed..curious and something that makes your imagination churn. Other than these oddities, the room was spacious.

Cafe Lago (Buffet)...not entirely impressed given the price point. Be weary lining up around 11am as they switch from breakfast to lunch at that time and they won't warn you about the price change or the fact that the food turnover may take a while so you can likely expect a pretty empty variety at the buffet for $30 pp. Instead try Payard (a cute little french bakery/restaurant) just a little further from the buffet. The express line for coffee to go will have a line, definately experience this place by going striaght to the restaurant and order the Eggs Benedict on fresh croissants...they will be the very best you've ever tasted. Everything is made rediculously fresh and you can taste it. Also for a fancy lunch, check out Spago in the forum shoppes. their pizza's are fantastic. Some other tips. If you are arriving on a Saturday be weary of the check in line, it is absolutely outrageous. It took us nearly 1.5 hours just to check in. When we arrived in our room I was reading the Caesar's Palace magazine that mentions that to avoid a long wait at check in to visit the bell desk as they can check you in as well. (would have been nice to know before I reached my room but if it can help all of you that's great too) This review would have received a 5 out of 5 if it weren't for the check in line. Also, if you want a central room that's somewhat close to everything (pool, L.V. boulevard, Taxi's, forum shoppes and Casino) request to stay in the Augustus tower. Very Very central and brand spankin new. The rooms are massive, the washroom is massive and there is a great view.

You can negotiate a daybed for around $200 food and beveridge guarentee (which you will spend in no time, believe me) on Mondays or anytime of the week negotiate for $100 for the same daybed. Definately worth it! The larger pool at Caesars is free for chairs but they are crammed right next to each other and you will be elbow to elbow with other people and the drinks and food aren't cheap so you'll spend the same regardless. Bellagio water show is right next door and is every 15 minutes from 7 until midnight. Planet Hollywood is across the street as well as Flamingo, Paris, Bally's etc. Definately register for a Rewards Card with Caesars palace (you can collect points at all their other properties in Vegas, Flamingo, PH etc.) these points will accumulate nicely which will give you some comps when you return back.

Planet Hollywood at caesars is a great place for a cooked English breakfast for $10- and the Virgin rep is located there each morning at 9.30am for any queries. A real disappointment was Freemont St [ old down town vegas ]. It looked cheap and our family felt a little unsafe. The shops were all souvenier-types, and the food outlets unappetising. The area seemed to be better suited to younger groups of people on stag or hen nights, that was also our impression of the Golden nugget Hotel [ situated next to Freemont st ]. The strip however is fabulous and safe, a real adults playground!!", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Macon, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel but wouldn't choose it again\u201d", "Author": "rwells745", "ReviewID": "UR117182333", "Content": "We went to Las Vegas for a conference.

We stayed in a suite in the Augustus Tower with another couple. The suite had a living room, dining room, and half-bath in the living area. Off to each side, the suite had two master bedroom suites. My husband and I stayed in the Master bedroom suite that had two bathrooms that were attached by a walk-through shower. Plus, our bedroom area had it's own living room. The other master bedroom had one bathroom suite and a bedroom area with living room as well. The view from the main living area was of the strip-The Flamingo, Bally's, and The Paris. Amazing! Our bedroom suite had a view of Bellagio Casino/Hotel and their fountains. Awesome! The rooms are always very clean, and the housekeeping staff does an excellent job. Why do I enjoy my stay at Caesars? First of all, it is centrally located on the strip. It is within walking distance to other fun casinos (Bill's Gambling Hall, formerly known as The Barbary Coast, and O'Shea's), great restaurants (Mon Ami Gabi's in The Paris-the best restaurant in Vegas), fun nightlife (Margaritteville-have live bands usually and Napolean's, the piano bar inside The Paris), and cheap(er) gambling (O'Shea's and Bill's). Second, Caesar's has plenty of good restaurants and nightlife within the hotel. Our favorite restaurant is the sushi bar/Japanese steakhouse (cannot remember name but we always eat there). We have tried Rao's twice, and it is okay. You are not guaranteed a good meal or good service. Their meatballs are delicious though! Third, Caesar's has an attached shopping center, The Forum Shops. We always stop in there at our favorite shops-Coach, Luck Brand Jeans. We now have a restaurant in the Forum Shops that we will add to our \"Must-Visit\" list-Max Brunner's Restaurant. All the items contain chocolate in them, sweet as well as savory. Try the chocolate fondue! Fourth, the nightlife is happening in Caesar's. Between Pure Nightclub and the tables with the dancers, there is always fun to be found! Fifth, the pool area is very nice. Lots of sun and cool water. Try the pina coladas with a shot of Myer's Dark Rum. Pricey, but delicious! One problem we did have this trip was checking in. Our room took forever to get ready, and we did not get in it until after 4 p.m. When we went back to get our room keys, another clerk tried to give us a different suite.

I responded to the text and got a response saying we're all set, and to go to the bell desk at check-in. We arrived at the bell desk and were immediately handed our room key which was waiting for us in an envelope. Literally took 10 seconds! The Augustus tower is amazing, and our room was clean and comfortable. The only odd thing was that when we first came into the room, everything was great except, in the bathroom, there was a lighter laying on the counter next to the sink, and all of the little bottles of shampoo, conditioner and soaps (about 8-10 of them) were tossed all over the counter, randomly lying around. Everything else was perfectly tidy! We left the lighter on the counter and it was gone the next day. Assume it belonged to housekeeping staff. I agree with other reviewers in that you don't necessarily get much value for what you pay for the room, as far as other hotel amenities. The best spots at the pool come at a price. It was difficult to find lounge chairs, and the pool bar and food service was slow and ridiculously priced, but, that's Vegas! The buffet at breakfast time was a bit of a disappointment as far as poor selection and the rudeness of the staff at the front. I did have some type of credit for free breakfast, and can't remember exactly what happened, but I was rudely scolded at the desk because I didn't immediately know the proper words to say to the woman about how our breakfast was to be paid for. I'm on vacation, I was being polite. There is no such thing as gracious guest service anymore. You're a cog in a machine there (as with many of these massive Strip hotels) and they can't deal with any deviation, or human interaction that deviates from the script they recite all day. I guess some places excel in this area better than others, and Caesars doesn't seem to be one. Where they do excel is with the proximity to the Forum Shops, and the wonderfully easy trip from my room in the Augustus Tower down to the Qua Spa, which is part of that tower. The spa was excellent, all of the staff was cordial and attentive, and it was a very relaxing spa experience with beautiful and meticulously clean facilities. Oh, and one more note on breakfast, skip the buffet and head to Payard just across the hall. There you'll find amazing, freshly made real fruit smoothies and breakfast crepes and pastries, and friendly staff. Definitely a highlight! Overall, Ceasar's was fine, but nothing that stood out to me as special, mostly due to just a very impersonal feeling that I seemed to get from the little interaction we had with staff.

The room actually smelled - stale cigarettes and mould. The furnishings were ancient and covered in dust - not one piece of wood was unchipped, and the beds hard as rocks. The wardrobe (a stand alone style best viewed at the local tip) was on four legs about 30 cms high. The carpet underneath the wardrobe was blood red. The rest was a pale orange, which is never a good sign. The bathroom itself looked like one you may find at a train station. I noted that the towels were so hard and stiff - I wold wager my gambling rations (which were not insignificant) that the towels had been hanging there for many, many months - and no one had been in this room in a while. The fact that Jesus (the friendly, if somewhat time-ravaged porter) had to use his shoulder and some hard pushes to open the room in the first place set the scene. I immediately phoned reception to advise them of the absolute shocking state of the room and was asked to come down stairs to see if they could do something. Upon returning to the reception desk, we were immediately switched to a different tower. The room was a mile apart from the first one. I must admit it was smaller than I thought it would be, but at least we had a view of the strip as opposed to a car park/construction zone this time. The bathroom was also a modern affair, including a TV screen set within the mirror. It also had the very American phenomenon of a phone in the WC. I am yet to imagine a scenario (apart from an Elvis or Mama Cass situation) where I would possibly want to talk on a phone whilst sitting on the khazi, the thought of the things it had seen enough to get one's hand sanitizer out of your carry on baggage. The casino at Caesars was shockingly disappointing. Looking run down, it had none of the pezazz I expected it to. Anyone familiar with the concept of a 'Leagues Club' would be surprised to hear it is less impressive than those. After visiting other casinos/hotels I am sure I would only stay at the Wynn/Encore upon any return to Vegas - though even with the eventual upgrade to a more suitable room, I would not be tempted to return to Caesars. On the plus side, the Forum shops are absolutely amazing, and the location is pretty good - being further down towards the 'quieter' part of the strip and away from the tattoo parlours/biker bars at the other end. I imagine this place would be appropriate for a group of young guys out for a boys-weekend without the girls. Looking for luxury - perhaps the Venetian would better suit?", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Virginia", "Title": "\u201cQuite a Nice Surprise!\u201d", "Author": "ontheroad19", "ReviewID": "UR116628592", "Content": "First let me state that I am not a Vegas fan.

I booked the hotel about 6 months ago via Caesar's website & their Friends and Family offer, I booked 2 Roman Tower rooms Sun-Thu for $89 / $89 / $89 / $119 each and was very pleased with the rate (I checked frequently for months after booking and only saw the room prices increase. And just before we arrived, the same rooms were being offered upwards of $240 per night via same Caesars site promotion). We arrived Sunday evening at 6:00pm for check-in and walked right up to the desk. There was no line at all. Tried the $50 sandwich trick and was not able to get an upgrade. So, I took my $50 back and thanked him for trying. Notables: 9th floor Roman Tower room was perfectly acceptable. Clean and comfortable and really a great value compared to other tower room rates. We spent less than 8 hours per day in our room so we did not feel we missed out on a suite option. Our room overlooked the strip with a view of Flamingo, Bally's and Bills, our other party's room overlooked the pools with a view of the Rio and mountains. Pool is fantastic! We visited every morning 8-1:00pm and noticed plenty of chairs available for all guests on Mon, with increased traffic as the week progressed. By Wed morning, all available chairs were gone by 10:00. No one asked for our room key or checked our bags upon entering the pool. We walked to the towel counter and grabbed 2 towels per person and just walked right in to find open chairs. I believe anyone could walk right in with food and beverages and spend the day at the pools. All casino and hotel staff are very professional and courteous. Good drink service while gambling and great service overall. Navigating around the property was easy after the first day. It is a very large campus but laid out well. Good ventilation and a little colder temperature compared to other casinos. Caesars has 2 completely separate casinos - main Caesars Casino with table games (as you enter the front doors to the resort) and the Forum Casino with table games, sports book, and poker room (back to the right as you walk past a few bars and restaurants). Great restaurants offered in the resort. All meals were great. We did not try the buffet. Can't comment on the spa or gym as we did not use those facilities. Caesars has many partner resorts close by and you can use your member card at them all. This is a wonderful resort in central proximity on the strip.

But there is so much to see in Vegas, so please venture out and bring some good walking shoes or sandals. Pool area was probably one of my favorite parts of this hotel. It gets confusing at times to get around ( due to all of the additions to hotel over the years). However, they have plenty of signs to help you out as long as you are sober enough to read them lol!. Yes its about 6 bucks for a coffee and 26 bucks for a poolside margarita, but thats Vegas for you. Its not cheap to eat and consume alcohol especially if you are not gambling. The rooms were very nice, I'd recommend staying in the deluxe rooms in the palace towers if you can. They are close to pool and main lobby. Weather in vegas was just way too hot for my liking.

We were supposed to get the most basic room valued at $200/night for our stay. When we got there and I assume because we were checking in at midnight that they were all booked up. I was told that hotel policy states in this scenario they would upgrade you to the next level up however there were no rooms available in the next level up. The clerk then said \"I don't know what we're going to do but it looks like we have no rooms available so I guess I'll have to consult with my manager.\" The manager and the clerk deliberated and decided to bump us from what was supposed to be a $200/night room to a $1,500/night room. We were bumped from a Deluxe Room to a Senator's Suite. You can imagine how happy we were but at the same time we were just beyond tired. However I was pretty insulted when it came to checking out. The front desk is beyond large and people were confused and how where to form a line. At 8:45am a woman with an iPad came up to us asking if were checking out, I said yes and asked if I was standing at the right place, she said yes and that somebody would be with me shortly. At 9:15am I went back up to that same woman with the iPad and asked for her to get a manger because waiting 30 minutes to check out was ridiculous. The woman with the iPad told me she could check me out using her iPad. Why did I have to wait 30 minutes to find that out, why didn't she tell me she had that ability and make that same offer before I wasted 30 minutes of my life? I understand the room was complimentary but that doesn't entitle me to receive lesser service.

All is well at Caesar's for the most part but there have been a few changes worth knowing about. Check in went fairly well, we arrived early in the morning and were lucky to be able to check in to three rooms right away when the normal wait would have been until 6 pm. Seemed OK, the price we paid for that checkin was adequate rooms but in the worst wing of the Forum Towers where there is NO view. You might be better off stashing your bags until 6 pm if a view of the strip is what you want. Good to specifically ask about getting a view. While we love the Venus pool for its small adults only atmosphere with close monitoring of guest behavior so no one gets out of control; it is important to note that things have changed. You must bring ID to the pool with you regardless of your age. Your hotel key alone will not do. You may NOT bring any food or drink, no not even water, into the Venus Pool with you. You MUST have your bag searched prior to entry and you may not have any medications with you. Clearly they have had a problem with drugs in the pool area, since even marked Advil and prescription drugs are not allowed. IF you have a prescription that for some odd reason you must have with you, then it must be in a pharmacy container with your name on it and security will hold it for you until you need it. It cannot come into the pool space with you. I think this is understandable policy, but many will not like it and you should \"know before you go\" if you have issues with this sort of thing. Once you are in the venus pool, the same exorbitant rates apply for renting day beds or cabanas, nothing new there. What is new is a 400 dollar minimum bar/food tab for our group of 6. Wow! Easy to achieve as drinks are EXPENSIVE, but a pretty high limit given the current economy in Vegas. They did not seem to have much trouble having people agree to the limit, the pool was nicely full although not packed. Service at the pool was friendly, efficient and good. Food quality is good and served in a timely manner. The pool is well looked after by busboys and security and remains tidy and well kept.

Quite a finish... Vegas is immense... Amazing place... Definitely a place to put on the \"bucket list\", although I think 3 or 4 days is more than enough time to set aside for a visit... I wouldn't fall over myself to return, unless it was for a 'stag do' (bachelor party) or something like that. We were in Vegas for 6 days, in an RV, The Travel Lodge, The Flamingo and Caeser's. We arrived at Caesars Palace, and because of a conference the night before, we were told that rooms would not be ready and to leave our bags with the bell and come back after 4pm... Not ideal after a long day... We didn't make a fuss and did as we were told... Came back later and it took 45 minutes for the bell to get our cases!... Lined up for 20 mins to check in... (I don't think its always like this to check in, just bad timing maybe) Then upgraded to a suite in Palace Tower for \u20ac67 per night... Very very nice room with a beautiful view of the pool (pics and vid to be uploaded)... Although it was nice, I regret upgrading... Our friend had a normal double room in the Forum Tower, which was not as nice, with a bad view... BUT... Its Vegas, and you will only be in the room for short periods of time... I was a sucker, and it was a nice surprise for my wife, but we both agreed that in this day and age, and they way things are, we could have spent the money more wisely... Besides... Our lovely suite had the neighbours from hell... The walls are like paper, and they partied LOUD all night when they got back to the room... I suppose the big room was great for them, and if you intend to drink or stay a lot in the room... Still... We were happy with the Hotel... We had three good nights there... The pool is excellent... Everything has the wow factor... The place is huge... Lots of places to eat and drink... It's all about the money... There is nowhere, bar the pool, that you can sit and rest without spending money... Its all geared towards you being foolish with your cash... So be careful... There is a reason they give you free drinks when you gamble... After sticking \u20ac15 into a one armed bandit before you get your drink, its not really free is it? Just be sneaky and the odd time you'll get freebies :-)... The rest of the time, be prepared to spend! Its an experience, and I'm glad we went... Grand Canyon in a helicopter was nice... the heat was extreme all the time... There is so much to take in all around you... the bellagio fountain display (close to the Hotel) is romantic, and great to watch... Not a place for families or kids... lots of people handing out prostitute cards all the time, everywhere you go... lots of scantily clad ladies pole dancing in the casino's... An Adults playground, but not for kids. There is no point trying to give out much more advice on Caesar's or Vegas, I could write a book, but feel free to contact me if you have any questions...

Multiple smaller pools adjacent to the largest main pool. Even have an area with \"swim-up\" blackjack that I may try next time. Expect to walk quite a bit to get to your room depending which tower you are in. This in itself, can be quite a maze if you don't know exactly where you're going.

The Venus pool has a party atmoshphere 7 days a week, opens at 11'ish, have better towels, service, a DJ etc.... It gets very busy on the weekends, so arrive early or miss out on seating (or even a spot on the cement). There are no photos allowed which is a shame, I would have loved to capture some of our time there. The quality of guests was much better than other hotels. The guests were mature and very few children, therefore the service was perfect.

I've stayed at MGM Grand, Luxor and New York, New York in the past and Caesars takes the crown as my favorite. Lets take a look at the pros and cons: PROS: The property is beautiful and the staff is friendly. I don't recall the name of the room we stayed in but I believe we stayed in the Augutus tower. The rooms were spacious with some nice touches of luxury without going over the top. The view from our window (floor to ceiling) was over the strip and the Bellagio water show. We spent a lot of time at the pools, which were absolutely amazing. The location is hard to beat in the middle of the strip with easy access to many other resorts and almost anything else you could need. Many good to great food options availble within the resort too. CONS: The resort is huge, so it may require a lot of walking. At times, if you are there to gamble, the table limits can be pretty high for the average gamer. Those are probably the two biggest (if you want to consider them that) drawbacks to Caesers Palace. Again, I've been to Vegas many times, been to several resorts and this resort really blew me away.

I originally booked a 5 night stay in a Forum Deluxe room 6/26/11-7/1/11. Room: I've read some reviews about the rooms, and I was actually excited to stay in an newly remodeled room, but I did want to have a nice view (not just a view of the side of the coliseum). Upon my arrival I asked for a corner room on a high level in the Forum Tower, but the person I that was helping me said that there was not anything available with that criteria. He kindly offered me if I would like to upgrade to the newer Augustus tower for $20 a night, the room would have an excellent view of the Bellagio fountains, and \"Eiffel Tower\". At first I was a little hesitant, but I agreed to the extra charges, and I couldn't be happier! We were on the 32nd floor with the best view I've ever had in Vegas. The room was nice and clean, we got a king size bed. The bathroom was wonderful, the room reminded me of the Luxury room at the Palazzo, but smaller of course. If I had one complaint about the room, it would be the noise from the street, during the course of our stay we must have heard about 7 ambulances/police cars go by a day at all kinds of hours. Food: Even though the hotel lacked places to eat late at night, We did enjoy eating at Nero's which is now open 24 hours (I had the Garden burger with Caesar salad). We also really enjoyed Lago, I really don't know why people don't like this place, I loved it! The only thing that bothered me about Lago was the incorrect or lack of signs in front of the food, but I still could tell that the food was by just looking at it, but I guess it could be frustrating for people with allergies or that can't eat pork. Pool: We did not go to the pools although it was really hot during our visit, but since it was during the week we did see a lot of empty chairs, and we did not see any security guarding the entrances and checking bags. Overall we had a great stay, and we would recommend this hotel to anyone. And if you are offered a upgrade the one I got at a reasonable price, I say take it!

Thinking it would be slow since it was midweek I didn't anticipate a crowd. However when we arrived at the check-in area after using the valet and bell hop we were told check-in would start at 1:00. This of course was a bit of a surprise however we quickly handled the situation with some gaming in the casino. This was nice because I got paid to wait since i won $15 dollars on Alice In Wonderland. We returned to check-in at 1:00 and of course everyone and there mother were trying to check-in. Lines were about 6 people deep and it took about 30 minutes to check-in. We unfortunately were in the slow line because there was a middle aged man checking in two young ladies that were giving him some attention (probably to get an upgraded room). Luckily this man was relieved and the line picked up pace. I actually had my 4 nights comped with Caesars however I did not want to stay in an older room so I requested an upgrade and was quickly accommodated. The room was on the 27th Floor of the Palace Tower. The room overlooked the strip on the Mirage side. I must say the bathroom was huge. The jacuzzi tub was massive and could easily fit two of me. FYI, I am a large man! It was awesome. The room was well appointed and even had robes. The TV was smaller but who is in Vegas to watch TV. The casino was great and managed to win $450 while staying there. The building is massive so there is nothing that is \"easy\" to get to. We have stayed at Paris numerous times and I think for the convenience and location of hotel amenities I would recommend Paris, however the rooms at Caesars are FAR superior to Paris. Even a Red Room (P) at Paris is not equivalent to the room at Caesars in the Palace Tower. I recommend skipping their buffet because it really wasn't great. Matter of fact it was just as bad as the Harrah's dinner buffet. Their breakfast buffet wasn't that good either. Just skip it. We ate at Nero's and that was decent in my opinion however the kitchen is located a great distance from the dinning room which means food does not arrive quickly and means service is a little below average. Also, my wife did not feel well after eating. Not sure if it's the food but..... Two days of our trip we went to the pools. #1 Get their early, like no later than 845. #2 The pools are awesome #3 Order the Large Mojito (BEST I EVER HAD) #4 Pools close early #5 This is a young \"hip\" crowd of people who want to be seen soooo not necessarily a pool area for you and the kids. In summary our trip was amazing! I loved Caesars and it is easily a favorite place to stay. OH!!! Almost forgot.....you have to go to QUA. It is the best deal in Vegas. $45 dollars for a day pass from 8 to 8. I would try to write to explain however I know you will not be disappointed.

The hotel was BEAUTIFUL, clean, a lot to do, but VERY busy. We checked in immediately and were upgraded to the Palace Tower. The palace tower was nice, clean, maid service was great, always had new towels. Make sure not to touch the drinks or food in the room, b/c they are sensored and you will be charged if the items are moved out of place. Pool Our room was close to the pool, which was nice b/c we spend most of our afternoons there cooling off . It was over 100 deg (and yes it was dry heat, but it didn't matter). The pool gets packed so finding a chair was tough, the employees were good about clearing off the unused chairs and allowing others to use them. They do have poolside blackjack in the adult pool where you can play in the pool, my husband was there most of the time. Drinks at the pool are expensive ($10-$20), the jolly rancher mojito was delicious! During the wk the staff doesn't check your pool bag so you could bring in water, food, or other stuff. However on the wkends (fri-sun) your bag will be checked and no outside food/drinks are allowed, which was crazy b/c they charge for everything there. There are 9 different pools not all are opened, however there was always a spot in the pool to cool off. Excursions/Shows We saw Carrot Top and he was hilarious! This guy doesn't receive enough credit, he was hands down one of the best performers I've seen. We laughed from when we sat down to when we left. If I could have seen this show for a second time I would. Make sure you do not leave the show to use the restroom b/c he will make fun of you. Our seats were front row A and center, the best seats in the room. We booked all our shows through expedia- it's a discounted rate and you are given the best seats when you book. Blue Man- good show, wouldn't see it again, but it was definitely a cool experience. The guys get you to think, have cool special effects, and choose 2 audience members to assist w/ the show. Our seats were in the \"blue\" section and the 2 members were also chosen from this section to go on stage. Pawn Stars- we took a cab ($15) to see the store. The old man, big hos, rick and chumly weren't there (boooo). We are fans of this show so my husband and I wanted to take a cab to the store and check it out. It was a cool experience, if you're a fan definitely go. You wait in line (about 20 min) to enter the store, about 50 people go in at a time. I bought a t-shirt to bring home w/ me. Restaurants The food in Vegas is out of this world! We ate at Mesa Grill, Spago, the Bellagio Buffet, Marguaritaville and Serendipity. All the food was great! If you go to Serendipity you MUST save room for dessert, it's amazing! Many places on the strip take the rewards card to accumulate pts. so don't forget to show the card, even starbucks took it...... Overall the trip was great, we did a lot of walking in and out of many of the malls and hotels. Caesars is huge especially when you get through the Forum Shops so don't forget to venture out. All the hotels on the strip have different themes and are very cool t explore. We did gamble at a lot of different hotels, not just Caesars.

However, I don't recommend doing that. The hotel has EVERYTHING. World class restaurants, hours of shopping, amazing pool, some of the best shows in Vegas, great clubs/lounges and of course, tons of gambling. Stayed here for a friends bachelor party and had a great time. We did leave the hotel, but just for clubs and restaurants. I called in advance to ask for the renovated tower, and not the old tower. They said no problem. Arrived and were put in the old tower(I forget the name). The elevator,floor and room smelled musky, like a seedy 2 star hotel. The room looked like a 2 star room. Not sure how this was ever considered 5+ star. The next morning we complained and were upgraded to the Augustus tower. What a difference! Crazy how these two rooms are in the same hotel. Augustus is right next to the pool. amazing location. The pool area is really nice. You need to get there early to get chairs, especially if you're a group of 5 or more. Early being no later then 9am(thats on the late side). Not a problem. I can't sleep in Vegas anyways. On Saturday we got a pool bed at Venus(private pool party at Ceasars). Had a great time there and not that expensive. I used the concierge service a couple times and they were extremely helpful!

We booked Caesars for our last 2 nights of our vacation and it's safe to say we wish we had stayed there for longer! Check In - Check in was a breeze. We arrived at 11am and there was only one person ahead of us in line. The lady who helped us was very friendly and joked around with us about people who make comments to her about the Hangover and think they're so witty (haha). We were given our room keys and off we went. Room - We were comp'd in the Forum Tower room which we really enjoyed. Nice decor, great view of the strip, THE MOST COMFORTABLE HOTEL BED I have ever felt (we actually slept in both days because we just didn't want to get out of bed), and a huge shower with a regular showerhead & a rain shower (hubby was in heaven). Pool - Loved the pool. We had previously, in this trip, stayed at Planet Hollywood and then Mandalay Bay, and we felt that Ceasars had the best pool complex. Perfect water temperature and so many different styles of pools to choose from. However, it was *packed* and always hard to find a seat. But this is most likely a result of the time of year we went, and the fact that it was a Thursday-Saturday stay. I'm sure weekdays are much quieter. Location - Like Planet Hollywood, can't be beat. However we didn't leave the hotel much for those last few days - you really don't need to. Caesars is like its' own little (big) world. Restaurants - Ridiculous amount of options for food! There's a food court in the Forum Casino for quick eats, Caesars has several restaurants (some hosted by famous chefs), and then you have the Forum Shops with lots more options. If I hadn't researched beforehand where we wanted to eat, we probably would have been overwhelmed. Our favorite meals were at the Cheesecake Factory (huge portions, and affordable - you must try the red velvet cheesecake!) and Hyakumi (one of their summer rolls, the Baked Scallop Roll, still makes my mouth water at the mere thought of it) Staff - No rude staff members - not sure why some of you say they're rude there? Perhaps your bad attitudes reflect on to them. *Shrug* - we loved the Caesars staff. Casino - Huge. Can't comment on much else as we didn't gamble much this trip.

BUT, 1. be leery of some of the rooms that have awkward roofside views. Ask for Poolside or at least a high up view, so you can somewhat lookout on the city or pool. But, getting a map and looking at the location of your room is key. 2. do not leave anything valuable laying out and not in a safe. i was getting ready in my best man's room for my wedding, and I forgot my diamond ear rings on the counter next to the sink in the bathroom, well after being \"handled\" and lied to about the situation being taken care of by two different people in security, i was finally taken care and allowed to properly file a report. They assured me that a \"lockdown key check\" procedure would be implemented, but i have not heard anything since, and this was done on May 30th. It is now June 23rd, and no word. 3. The front desk is not 100% truthful about room availability. My parents and other family came after we checked in, and we were attempting to get a room upgrade because of the bad view. They gave us a room with a better view, and were willing to pay for a better tower and view, but they \"weren't available.\" we were moved to another room a few floors higher, but we made it clear we wanted a nice room because of our wedding. then, family came in and checked in less than an hour later and were given rooms with a better views and accommodations than ours. So, they were in deed available, and it took my mother calling the front desk and demanding that we be put in a room near hers in order to help my bride get ready for the wedding, made a room miraculously become available. 4. All three rooms we were in had furnace closets with very old filters that had not been changed in months. they said they were on a schedule to be changed, but when rooms are occupied, they get missed, and they are not able to get to them all... this was a bogus excuse to me bc i want to know what person would deny them access to change out a filter that takes less than 10 seconds to change to help them breathe cleaner more filtered air. there were a total of 6 room furnace filters changed between my family and friend's rooms. so, it would be smart of you to check your filter upon check-in. 5. No free internet service. No free local phone calls. You will be nickeled and dimed at this hotel, like many in Vegas, so always ask. Never assume they will not charge you because you are charged for things you may never have been charged for elsewhere. The Good: 1. The main good thing i must say about Caesar's is that everything is located in the hotel. and, if i didn't want to go outside and see the rest of Vegas, i would be able to go to the Forum Shops, which is a beautiful Saks 5th Avenue store type mall. There are also clubs and restaurants in the hotel and mall... I would suggest going to the mall and not pay $15 for a hamburger though, but that is up to you. 2. The architecture throughout the hotel and Roman soldiers, along with \"Cleopatra\" for photo ops, is an added plus. 3. The pool scene is great! The Venus pool has guest performances, and it is a \"European style\" (topless) pool. They normally charge for admittance to this, but during the week, all you need is your i.d. You will not be disappointed. The waitresses alone are dressed to kill, but sorry to disappoint, they don't go topless.

LOCK the refrigerator. 2) Food and drink at every place is way over priced. Much better values if you go to old Vegas along Fremont Street. Bus ride is $7 for 24 hours, and still a better deal to pay that and eat elsewhere. 3) POOL Warning: if you are like us and like to get a cup of coffee and go to the pool early, make sure you buy your coffee at Paynard only! We bought coffee and a breakfast sandwich at the Forum Food court and walked over to the pool. We were denied access because our coffee was not from Paynard and no food is allowed period. I can understand about the food, but the coffee?? And you cannot take any bottled water, gatorage, or anything out there. In the half hour it took us to drink our hot coffee in front of the pool doors, there were many people rapidly drinking gatorade or Aquafina water, rather than throwing it away or taking it back to their room. They want you to be a captive audience. 4) while at the pool we bought 3 drinks...two mojitos for my wife and a rum punch for me. I will say the drinks were excellent, but then we got the bill and they were $20 each! Most expensive drinks I have ever had! 5) Even with all the folks behind the desk (must have had about 10 lines going), check in was lengthy. 6) did not care for the slots or tables in Caesars, so spent most of our time either in 4 Queens (old Vegas), or Harrahs (across the street). We were in Vegas 4 years ago on vacation and stayed at Golden Nugget. I would rate that trip much higher than this trip just because of expenses.

Great rates/service booking everything and they still accommodated us even after one of our couples had to drop out last minute due to unforeseen circumstances (supposed to be a 5 room minimum). We lost out on potential perks associated with the program but they honored our severely discounted room rates which we were thrilled with. From check-in to check out we were treated royally despite the initial inconvenience of their computers crashing that afternoon (all computers at all Caesars properties we were told). Once things were up and going (an hour or two later) they called us to return and promptly assigned us our rooms which were all upgraded from Forum Tower to Palace Tower rooms. Because we booked with Total Experience we were able to check-in/out at the VIP Diamond desk which may have helped, but everyone was smiley, friendly and genuinely helpful in accommodating our request for all 4 rooms in the same tower. The Palace Tower rooms we received were scattered from floor 13 to 27, a couple of which had great views overlooking the pools. All of them were very clean, quiet, comfortable and had a decent sized bathroom with separate jacuzzi tub. Nothing over the top but we generally don't need too much as we don't spend a lot of time in the rooms when in Vegas. We ate several times on the property (Payard, Lago, Serendipity3, Munchar) but the highlight was definitely Bradley Ogden. All 8 of us had an amazing meal - everyone's best meal in a long, long time. A sizable bill to be sure but worth every single penny. Our service from Chris was impeccable and professional to a 'T'. Thanks Chris! The Garden of the Gods pool complex was part of the reason we wanted to stay at Caesar's and it did not disappoint. Difficult at first to get 8 chairs together if you don't book and you don't get there early but with a little patience we snagged some. Lifeguards seemed to come around relatively often to remove towels by those looking to save chairs ahead of time. Wife commented many times about just how dang good her poolside cranberry coconut mojito was. Gaming wise the casino was pretty decent. Didn't really hit the tables much and the slots were average. One of our highlights though was spending a night in the Sports book watching the NHL/NBA playoffs and playing the ponies. Great venue and with some time/patience we ended up getting enough seats for everyone. All in all everyone thoroughly enjoyed Caesars Palace and would highly recommend it anyone. Aside from Caesars we've stayed at the TI and Paris, and by far the entire Caesars experience was a cut above. It can be a much more expensive stay but if you keep your eyes open and/or take advantage of the Total Experience program then deals do pop up and make it a great value. We kept our eyes on deals to the Venetian/Palazzo and the Bellagio but for the dates we were there the Total Experience rates were MUCH better than the other resorts. For reference sake, we generally stay at Best Western, Holiday Inn Express, Sheratons, etc), to give you an idea as to the price point and level of service/property we're used to.

There was a very small queue at check-in and we were attended to within 10 mins. The man at the desk was polite and friendly and checked our reservation. He noted that we had pre booked a 'deluxe' room for a weeks stay. He asked if we wanted to upgrade this room to a luxury room in the Augustus Tower overlooking the Bellagio Fountains for an extra $30 per night. We were happy to do this as that was the room we were hoping to be allocated. We were allocated room 2572. This room was larger than the deluxe rooms but not worth $30 more per night. The view of the Bellagio Fountains was OK but would have been better if we had been on a higher floor. Although we were on floor 25, this was actually only about 4-5 floors from the ground...very confusing. The room itself was nicely furnished and designed. There were some signs of wear and tear but overall it was very nice. There was an easy chair with a footrest in the room along with an armchair and a sofa. We positioned the chairs in front of the floor to ceiling windows to catch the view and chill out with a drink at the end of our evening. The room was quite dark, even with all of the lights on. This didnt cause us any problems. The bathroom was nice, with a jacuzzi bath, twin sinks, separate shower and toilet. Ameneties were lovely (Gilchrist and Soames) and relplenished every day. Housekeeping was efficient. The hotel is huge and sprawling. You can easily get lost within the interior of the hotel and casino. There are lots of places to eat and drink but some of the places can be quite expensive so it pays to shop around a little. There is a food court where inexpensive breakfast items can be purchased. We tried the buffet one morning and although the food was pleasant, the variety was poor and there are much better places to eat if you like buffet style food. The casino is fab, lots of roulette, craps and blackjack tables, the minimum is usually $10 but this can go up to $15 at busy periods. The sports book is fairly quiet most of the time. The poker room is nice but absolutely freezing inside. Take a jacket with you if you are in a tournament or cash game. Its quite bright in there too. The location of the hotel is its main attraction, really fantastic, right in the middle of all the action and the grounds of the hotel are beautiful, lots of white marble pillars and statues. Its a sight to behold when viewed from the opposite side of the road at dusk. The pool area is stunning visually, but you have to get there early to get a decent bed. We didnt experience any security at the pool whatsoever but we always went early before 10am. The day beds are rarely in use because they have to be paid for which we felt was a waste of space. The one compalint we had about the hotel was the VIP areas for Platinum 7 star holders. There were areas where only these members could go into, or taxi lines only they could stand in. It was a bit insulting to us 'regular' guests who have paid good money but choose not to blow thousands of dollars every night gambling. Caesars should drop this policy. Its a little crass and condescending. We had a wonderful time in Vegas (3rd time) and Caesars played a part in that but as the title says, you do get what you pay for.

Since each of us has travelled quite extensively, we knew it would be best to prebook everything to ensure that we had non smoking rooms(I have severe allergies) and that they were adjoining. Upon arrival, we were told that adjoining rooms were not available and that it was simply a request-not guarantee. So not only did we not end up side by side but we were placed in smoking rooms(apparently the rooms we booked were not available until the next day). Within 15 minutes of being in my room my allergies flared up so badly that I could hardly breathe. We immediately went to the front desk and stated that I could not stay in that room but the clerk was unfazed by my medical condition and stated that there wasn't anything she could do. It was not until I insisted that I could die did she make any effort to help us. My room buddy+I were then placed on a non-smoking floor while the other 2 were forced to stay in the smoking room. The next day we went downstairs to be moved to our booked rooms and when my 2 friends walked into their room and there was still the previous occupants luggage inside. My gf called down to the front desk and the clerk seemed confused and stated that the previous occupant had checked out. She told them to leave the \"extra\" luggage at the front door and the bellman would pick it up. Since we had a full schedule for the day, we left to check out the various other hotels and went shopping. We arrived back at Caesar's around 5 because we had tickets for a 6pm show and when my gf went back into her room, not only was the \"extra\" luggage gone, but their luggage had also been taken. So now the hunt is on for their luggage that had their ID and show tickets in it. It wasn't until 45 minutes later that their luggage was located but by that time they ended up being late for the show.

Thankfully the hotel manager(I think his name was Alex) came out to find out what the problem was and once we spoke to him, he immediately sensed our frustration and made every effort to help. He even gave us a $250.00 food+beverage credit to use for the remainder of our trip and followed up to ensure that we were doing well.

After a bit of research here on TA, we requested a room in the Augustus Tower. Upon check-in, the desk clerk asked if we'd like to have a \"view\" for an extra $30/night (out of our own pocket - the company doesn't care if we have a view). In all fairness, nearly all the rooms in the Augustus Tower have a nice view of something; the extra $30 gets you a high floor overlooking the Bellagio fountains. So after we agreed to the upgrade, he told us that the room would not be ready for a few hours! Obviously we were bummed out, and my father (staying across the street at Bills) had been wandering around for hours and needed to sit down so I \"expressed some concern\" (a.k.a. got real whiny). He called the cleaning crew to see if anything was available yet, and VERY LUCKY!!!! A fresh room was available instantly on the 45th floor! And I must say, the view was epic. Easily worth the extra $$, we spent many a happy hour gawking at those beautiful fountains and the rest of the Strip. The rest of the room was huge and gorgeous. Bed was very comfortable, though I'm not a big fan of feather pillows, they were nice ones and the sheets were lovely. There was a small couch & easy chair with a coffee table by the window, a little table with extra chairs, a big dresser with shelves & a mounted flat-screen TV, honor bar (we did not partake), and a closet with the usual iron & hangers. The floor was VERY quiet, I know we had neighbors because I saw Do Not Disturb signs on their doors, but didn't hear a thing. Nice thick walls are a very good thing in Vegas. The bathroom was FANTASTIC! Double marble sinks, super deep jacuzzi tub with room for two (or three if you're small and kinky), separate glass-walled shower, separate toilet room with it's own telephone, and of course a wall-mounted TV. If you haven't had breakfast in a jacuzzi while watching Japanese soap operas, well you should certainly do that as soon as possible. Not sure if this is a benefit or a drawback, but Kendra Wilkinson and Hank Baskett were staying on our floor while we were there, we actually bumped into them twice. The Caesars complex overall is absolutely huge and it is pretty easy to get lost. The pools are amazing but after people have been getting drunk in there all day, don't be too horrified to see a few spilled drinks floating by. The bars & restaurants inside are expensive, but the service was unfailingly gracious. With the exception of the food court (yuck), every place we tried was lovely. We ate at Rau's one evening ($$$ but delicious) and at Snackus Maximus by the pool (pretty good for pub-type food). We enjoyed drinks & ambiance at the Galleria Bar, the Seahorse Bar, Numb, and the Shadow Bar; all were pricey but plenty of fun. We also had a few beverages and LOTS of fun in the outdoor courtyard that's all set up for the Absinthe show - actual seats that don't require you to play slots if you sit down, plus free shuffleboard & cornhole! We just hung out there one evening, then went back another night to see the show.

SHE SAT AT ABOUT 2 FEET FROM ME AND LOOKING AT ME WHILE SHE WAS SINGING. I HAD A HARD TIME BELIEVING IT. This I will never forget, the look she had when she looked at me and when she shooked my hand is forever in my heart. For me this was better that to have met her with the other fans and have a picture taken. As she did receive my letter and in my letter I tell her that her music eases my pain, and the eye contact we exchanged was more personnal for me.

The place really wants to nickel and dime you or worse really. The bathroom was a bit dated. The tiles in the shower had cracks and some mold or permanent dirt on the edges. The water pressure in the shower was good. The bathroom was large. They had the tiniest little hair dryer, which actually did the trick but come on. There was plenty of closet space, nice robes but not enough hangers. The bed was comfy and so were the pillows. The wall indeed were paper thin. We heard the family come in next door just past midnight, clapping, laughing and carrying on. I waited a few minutes and called security and asked them to please have them quiet down. My husband had a 8 am meeting in the am and not everyone in Vegas is there to party past midnight. Security came very quickly and handled it very quickly as well which is really all they can do. The property itself was not my favorite. The pool area is nice but there are FAR too few lounge chairs, plenty for a cost but the free ones are taken right away. They had one of the pools closed and another roped off. So there was the \"adult\" area open which I didn't want then the 2 big pools open plus one small one as well. There were tons of people as it was in the upper 90's and they had 2 pools roped off. Can't understand that. The casino is very smoky. I noticed overall in Vegas that it is smokier this time than in 2009 when we last visited. I think the properties must figure out ways to help with this. It kept me out of casinos. The Qua spa was by far the best thing this property had to offer. Lovely facility, amazing service and quite relaxing. I recommend it. The last thing we noticed was no quick checkout. We had to leave before 6 am, we expected a bill under our door like we receive in most all other hotels, but instead we had to go to the front desk and check out the old fashioned way.

Great tip i got from reveiws on this site. they gave in palace tower room was great.So in my opinion book your room ahead of the crowd and be willing to grease the wheels.If you come in late on a Friday you probably get the left overs the rooms that are the oldest .they are going to take care of the people that are right in front of them not ones yet to come.They give better than average drink on the casino floor. ie grey goose or Guiness beer.I didn't have anything else but you probably can get any top shelf.The pool was really nice the only complaint is the prices for drinks.46 dollars for 6 beers.Don't think about getting anything in to pool area they protect it like a fort.Not even a bottle of water gets by.As for gaming the slots are kind of tight and poker room not a good place to play .There are not many table going and local pros waiting to pick off weak players. some team play here but in general there are easier places to play.I rate my self a pretty good player for a non pro.I could hold my own but prefer to go where softer play and more fun.Dealers were pretty good.As in most rooms around vegas buy in for max or close to max and trap,trap trap and you will get payed often.Once last note on the gaming is the sports book which is very nice, big tv's and some table with tvs on them. good location to get food and drink near by.sometimes hard to find waitress but bar was close so no problem getting a drink.They give you a free drink coupon for every 100 bet .I didn't go to any shows here but they have have big name singers here.Now the number one reason i like this hotel was location is great.I think i would stay here again if i get a reasonable rate.Oh ya one last thing this town runs on tips so if you want something and want good service in future just splash a little cash and you probably get back more than you think.Stronger drink,better rooms,faster service ect.", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice property but would never stay there again\u201d", "Author": "Dudenchick", "ReviewID": "UR111210762", "Content": "We stayed there for 2 nights in May 2011.

We arrived at the hotel around 5:30pm and walked right up to the counter, no waiting and fast check-in. Do take advantage of the Bell Desk. They will take your luggage to your room and pick it up upon departure, no fee. Not knowing how far the room was, we lugged our bags to the room. Never again! (Side note: We booked our room online through an email special and paid $1400 for five nights, $280 a night, in the Forum Tower Deluxe Room. Upon check-in, we were offered a $40 a night upgrade since we booked online, which we declined.) Our room was located in the Forum Tower, 5th floor, Deluxe Room at the very end of the hall. The new decor was gorgeous, in purples, greens and white. Our view was the side of The Colosseum which didn't bother us. There was a single-cup Keurig coffee maker in the room! If I'd known I would have brought my own k-cups. They do offer their k-cups ($6 each), other treats and frig drinks but for a price. PLEASE NOTE: Although we didn't have any \"neighbor noise\" other than the ppl across the hall coming and going, we did hear \"lovemaking\" from a room as we walked down the hall. ;-) The layout of the hotel took some getting used too. In the Forum Shoppes, we recommend dining at Wolfgang Puck's Spago and Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab. Every staff person we encountered was friendly and helpful. The pool areas were posh! It was too cool to get in but a very nice area. They do have a whirlpool out there so take advantage of that. If you are a Total Rewards Member (or want to register for free) AND you \"Like\" Caesars Palace on FB, they were offering a BOGO at Lago Buffet. It's worth the savings ($17.95 breakfast). Remember that on Sunday's the breakfast buffet is more expensive (a champagne brunch). All in all, a great place to stay, right in the heart of The Strip.

I found a great deal (Friends & Family promo) online for aprox $130/night so we booked right away. The room we booked was a classic, but a week prior to leaving I received an email from the hotel offering an upgrade to a Augustus Tower Deluxe Room or a Palace Tower Deluxe Room for an additional fee (I think it was $30.00?) Anyways, after reading the horrible reviews regarding the classic rooms we called and got the upgrade. Too bad we wasted that money. The \"upgrade\" apparently is actually upgrading from a craptastic motel 6 room to a motel 6 suite. Either way, they both are gross. Seriously, I have stayed at much nicer *3 hotels.... the headboards were stained (ew), the lamp shades were gross (dust and stains), the bathroom- although it was probably nice 10 years ago is dated. We were on floor 28? I think it was actually maybe 8 stories up- definitely not really 28 floors up and could hear the music from the bar... at 5am. Nice. I will give it one thing- I found the bathroom and the carpet very clean- and the sheets were also clean. If the only thing I can really say is that the carpet, bathroom and sheets were clean I wouldn't recommend you waste your money on this place. We tried to go to the pool 3 days in a row but the chairs were always reserved... people play the \"towel game\" here and get up at the crack of dawn to reserve seats at the pool. I have never experienced this at any other Vegas hotels... there are usually an abundance of chairs... I wish the staff there spent more time cleaning up these towels and less time digging through everyone's bags (seriously, they will not let you bring in a sealed bottle of water or a granola bar- everything is searched and thrown out)... as well as trying to get the girls to go to their topless pool... although if you want a seat go there, there was no one in there (but that was probably because a lousy beach chair there will cost you $50.00!!) Oh, one last thing, the day and night we were there the tv didn't work... not a big deal, but it's kind of nice to have the option to turn on the tv and watch a movie since you're usually exhausted and no one working there seemed to care.

My associate and I were attending and exhibiting at a major pharmaceutical convention that Caesars was hosting. Everythng seemed to be fine up through check-in. Then things began to turn. My major complaint was the friendliness and hosptitality of the staff. Extremely poor. Poor in their attitudes, and commitment to customer service. After 2 nights, my business associate was required to return home for some urgent meetings. At check-in we had stated to the clerk that we were to check out on the 19th of May which he stated was \"no problem\" and was as far as we knew, all set. Much to my surprise when I went to return to my room and my key didn't work. I proceeded to go back to the lobby desk with arms full of materials that I had to take back from the show. I was met by a woman who stands in the lobby and what appears to \"direct traffic.\" I explained the situation to her. She brought me to the counter at which time I explained again that my key wasn't working and I wasn't sure if I was also on the reservation. I explained to this woman and the counter help the situation. No one could tell me anything about the reservation and the woman continually asked me if I had any \"identification\" in the room because it was a \"liability\" for Caesars if they let me back into MY ROOM! I explained at least a half a dozen times to the woman that I have my driver's liscence in my wallet and my wallet was in my pocket with me. She continually asked me if I had my passport with me?! I asked her \"why would I have my passport with me when im a US citizen and I have my driver's liscence!\" By this time my nerves were frazzeled with her. I stated I had travel tags on all my bags that matched the one on my backpack I had with me. I was told by the desk staff to go up to my room where security will meet me. Security finally arrived and wouldn't you know.....he only asked me for my identification (driver's liscence) and checked NOTHING else!!! According to the traffic police woman in the lobby, I needed my passport and whatever else!!!! Prior to leaving the desk, I was told that I needed my business associate to call to verify who I was to get another key. When I completed getting cleaned up to meet some clients for dinner, I stopped at the front desk again. It was amazing that the new desk clerk found my name on the reservation. He also discovered that the clerk who checked us in only checked us in until the 18th and NOT the 19 that he said was \"taken care of.\" I was told at this time by the manager that I had to vacate the room becasue Caesars was \"overbooked.\" I told the manager \"Brian\" that I was supposed to be there for one more night and that I was attending the conference that the room was booked under; BEING HOSTED BY CAESARS!!! He said that all he could do was to\" find me (at an additional charge) another room at a sister property.\" I told hom that this was unacceptable seeing that it was his desk clerk that made the error! He did not budge not care that the error was on his employee. I had to make reservations for 1 night acros the street at the Flamingo. I had asked if I could get assistance because I had my luggage and show materials. He stated that there was no assistance available to help with the move. As a frequent business traveller, and one who travels to Vegas 3 to 4 times a year on business, this has been by far THE WORST experience I have ever had. I have been to many of the strip hotels and have ALWAYS been welcomed and helped in any way. Caesars Palace I feel has gotten \"too big for it's britches\" and where they may have the name and location, the certainly DO NOT have the quality care and commitment to their customers.

On arrival to the hotel the reception staff were pretty busy and we had to wait to be checked in. Staff were less than useless. Any questions we asked about the hotel or services etc took them an age to answer, often having to check with other members of staff before coming back to us with some useless answer. We asked for a bellboy to help with our bags (we had two massive suitcases and two rucksacks) we were told there weren't any to help. What????? We stayed in the Palace tower. These are suppose to be the better newer rooms at the resort. The room was average. Cleanliness was also average. Toiletries were not refilled when needed. Often toilet rolls and soap were not replaced. The hotel is huge. Not an east place to get around. The walk to the room from lobby, pool, casino, forum shops etc was a good work out! The food at the hotel is less than perfect. We tried many of the different food outlets. Staff in all were average. Food was less than average. If you are looking for a nice meal as a treat...go to the Bellagio next door. Food is a different level there. Fresh and tasty. The pool area was clean but very busy. There are lots of loungers and the waitresses come to you for drink orders etc. There are security guards on the doors to the pool area who go through your bags looking for food/drinks you may have purchased elsewhere (annoying!) and also checking your room card as confirmation that you are a guest of the hotel. This was all very tedious. There is loud music being played all day at the pool area. Take an iPod unless you like american pop, rap and r'n'b. Casino is very big. I'm not a fan of gambling but many in our party were and really enjoyed themselves. Free drinks if you are gambling. Forum shops are worth a visit. All high end stores and the odd H&M. Bars in the hotel are very expensive!! They offer little entertainment and are pretty soul less. The hotel location is right on the Strip. Go out and have a walk about...interesting to see the other hotels and mix with the mass of tourists! It is very busy day and night. A real experience. Overall, we didn't really like this hotel.

Upgraded to a room in Augustus Tower. The \"mini-suites\" are end/corner rooms which are very quiet. While the tower is showing a little age, it is still a great place to stay. Beds are getting lumpy, they could use a change. It definitely is expensive to go to Vegas these days. This is the first time I stopped at a supermarket on the way to the hotel and bought a 35 pack of water (for the price of one bottle $5.00 at the hotel). This was actually a great savings. This location is the best in Vegas! They finally wised up and have a few \"express\" places to get coffee in the morning. The service has improved. People are friendlier and it is a nice change from the last several years. My beef has always been the pools. They are inconsistent in how they allow access. There are a lot more \"pay\" beds where you have to pay upwards of $175.00 for a bed next to the pool. This dimishes the amount for chairs. People really get angry about this. Surely they could come up with a better plan with more regular chairs poolside. But some people pay for these (or are comped) so anything to make a buck. Here's the beef - from Augustus Tower there are two doorways to the pool area, one by the snack bar, the other across the buffet. They now have guards - either pool guys or whatever - that stop you from accessing the pool area through these door UNLESS you are a seven star (whatever that is - I'm not). So, pretty much NOBODY goes through these doors and you must walk all the way around to get to the main pool entrance. They actually pay people to man these doors. Sorry, but the suit who thought of that has no clue. I pay for my room and food and goodies and whatever, but I can't walk through these doors to get to the pool. The pool people at Casesars have always made the pool experience, which should be relaxful, everything but that. Sorry management, but this is just wrong. Go see for yourselves how many people DON'T use these doors! Otherwise, I still love the place!

I loved it, it was great. From the time I walked in the door and checked in from the time I left. I had a very nice suite on the 35th floor of the Augustus Tower over looking the strip and water show at Billagio. I had the hang over suite! If u watched the movie u know what I'm talking about. The other name for it is senate suite. But it was great. Almost 3000sq ft, 3 bathrooms, huge bedroom, livingroom, dining room. A maid and butler always checked to ensure we had everything we needed. Although I can say I am 30 yrs old and love to gamble I still think it is a great place, right in the heart of the strip. I don't party and act up and carry on like I'm 19-21 but sure I like to go there and get away from everyday life and a great time. Caesars always provides excellent service to it's valued guests... Sorry for those that talk negatively about the place, I guess Las Vegas isn't a vacation spot for elders.... But I find it cheap to eat, great shopping, GREAT PENNY machines!!!! I visit there 3 times a year and will continue to stay at Caesars. Although the young people drinking and walking around drunk I didn't let that bother me from having a goodtime.

We had a hard time finding where to enter from the strip to park. Once we figured out to enter on Caesars Palace Rd (or Way, I can't remember) and go to the right to the self-parking garage we found a parking space. We didn't want to do valet as the wait time is usually longer than it takes us to park our own car and walk. The parking garage is a bit confusing as well but after the first time through we figured that out also and then it required very little thought on how to get from our car to the Forum Casino. Check-in was quick. We arrived at 8PM and there was only a few people in line and 5 staff members working efficiently to help everyone. We had a reservation through Delta for a Deluxe room. The gentleman that checked us in was very quick and pleasant, not overly friendly but not rude either. He gave us our keys and gave us directions on how to get to our room. We were given a Palace Tower Premium Room on the 27th floor. The room was very large and very clean. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were magnificent! The view was of the pool but we could also see the strip to the left and an amazing view of the outer city to the right. The windows were very dirty though. Our room had 2 bathrooms with a connecting shower in the middle and a large whirlpool bath. We ordered room service at 11PM on Sunday. Pizza for my spouse and a garden salad for myself. Prices were very reasonable. The pizza was delicious, I highly recommend it. The salad was large and very fresh. They also included some fresh made dinner rolls which were crispy and chewy and yummy. The entire bill was under $40 including all charges and gratuity. The casino was by far the best lay-out of all the casinos we visited during our stay in Las Vegas. We liked the Forum Casino. Ventilation seemed superior in Caesars casinos compared to the rest, there were many people smoking but it did not smell of smoke. Other casinos had a heavy smoke smell and burned my eyes with the thickness of the smoke. The table games did not have an open seat from 4PM-2AM, it was a very busy casino. We did not have a chance to use the pool but it looked amazing. The Forum Shops were great with a large selection of shops. Vosges-Haut Chocolat is a must, they offer samples! Just walking through was an experience to see all the statues and fountains. One thing I didn't like was all the intoxicated young people roaming around our tower \"checking things out\". They are loud and obnoxious and left their empty drinks all over the place. They should have some way of preventing this from happening, like using a room key to access the elevator to the room towers. Check out was very quick on Tuesday morning at 7AM, no line and the bill was correct. We very much enjoyed our stay at Caesars and would happily return, although next visit I think we are going to try PH as we liked their dining options and the Miracle Mile Shops.", "Date": "May 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBe prepared to spend and walk (long review)\u201d", "Author": "stewsu", "ReviewID": "UR108569066", "Content": "My family and I spent 3 nights at Caesars for my brother's wedding which was held there as well. While we got a good price for the rooms due to booking the wedding guests through the casino host, the rest of the stay cost a small fortune. Expect to be nickel and dimed at this beautiful but expensive hotel. Room coffee as stated in the review prior to mine is $12. It is a Keurig single cup machine for which you can ONLY purchase 4 cups (minimum) for $12. Although this sounds like a lot because most hotels give you the free coffee machine in the room, it pales in comparison to the $4.95 or $6.95 you will pay for a CUP of coffee in the food court. 2 pastries and 2 sm. coffees cost us $18 in the food court. This was the least expensive option for breakfast. A tea bag with hot water=$4.00. Just a tiny example of what you will pay to eat. The place is HUGE with more of a resort atmosphere than a classic hotel. You will walk miles to get from one place to another. Lots of young people getting drunk walking through the casinos and the hotel. Reminded me of a spring break destination. This certainly is not the Vegas of old. Dollar and quarter slots have been replaced with penny slots as these are now the majority on the casino floors. Obviously these hotels are not out to lure the gambler but have instead targeted a much younger generation whose interests are in drinking, partying at the expensive nightclubs and shopping at the high end boutiques. Glad I came for a wedding and saw this because if I had planned a trip to go to Vegas to gamble and eat cheaply as used to be done, I would have been very disappointed. I won't be returning anytime soon. My money will go a lot farther in Mexico or elsewhere.And yes, check in was over 30 minutes. Had to return 4 times to see if room was ready.

I was expecting so much more. I stayed in the Centurion Tower, which is the second oldest tower in the Caesar's complex. It's highly obvious that the only money that Caesar's is putting into this tower is for maintenance only. My room was spacious, the bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was clean and roomy. But the negatives far outweighed these positives. The carpet was VERY dirty. \"Gross\" is not an understatement. Numerous stains all over the room. Room smelled of smoke -- even though it was supposed to be a non-smoking room. I guess the room can switch from smoking to non-smoking depending on if the guest staying in the room is a smoker or not. The furniture was old and dinged-up. One of the handles on the TV cabinet was missing -- very cheap looking. The TV itself was a 27 inch tube TV -- best that 1995 could offer. My clock-radio looked like Caesar's picked it up at a garage sale -- in 1985 -- no joke. The rest of the furniture was also old and very dated. I was afraid to sit in it. And the room had no desk at all. I found out on my second day there that the lock on my door was not working at all. Had to have maintenance come up and literally replace the whole door handle/lock assembly. Also, the Centurion Tower has 3 elevators, but only 1 was working the entire time I was there -- 5 days. I found out later that Caesar's has actually sold the Centurion tower to another hotel chain, which is probably the reason why they are not putting any money into it. Also, if you want to get a work-out in while staying at Caesars, be prepared to pay $25 per day. That's how much it costs to access the fitness center. Lastly, when I checked out of the hotel, the person at the front desk did not even ask me how my stay was or if I had a good time.

Restaurants in the hotel, as you\u2019d expect are very expensive so we didn\u2019t bother going there. The food court was ok \u2013 breakfast was only available between 6am and 10am. And then no food available between 10am and 11am until all the other eateries in the food court opened at 11am (around USD 10 per person).

The menu had different things on it then at the physical food counter so we decided to take our soda and leave. Eventually we track her down and of course she didn't remember our soda. We ended up leaving the pool all together and eating overpriced pizza at the food court. Being from the east coast we were up pretty early and it still was always difficult to get a chair in the sun at the pool. I wasn't impressed with the pool area. All the towers of rooms block the sun so there are only so many good seats around the pools. Every morning we had breakfast at Payard. Very delicious crepes! Always a long line but worth it when they get your order correct. This is our 3rd time to Vegas in 3 years and I'd say our experiences at Mandalay and Encore were much better.

Wow, what an amazing Hotel(if you can call it that!) It's more an experience! Arrived about 20:30, 21st April, day before good friday, no queue at check in at all, given an upgrade to the palace Tower, over looking the pool complex. Mini suite was fantastic! The bed is better than our own, had the best nights sleep ever!! Fantastic pool complex, (6 pools) but be aware, friday-sunday, its like trying to relax in a night club, you cannot escape the heavy base, loud booming club music coming from the venus pool area, I'm no prude, but after a long flight the day before, we really wanted to relax, gave me a terrible headache and had to leave the area, next time we will make sure we are out on those days! Central location, middle of the strip, Ballagio right next door. We walked the length of the strip, take good, comfy shoes!! So much to see, a must do is lunch/dinner in the Stratasphere, revolving restaurant, fantstic views across the strip, and the food was good too! The walk to the restaurant via the casino a bit ugly, but worth it. The Grand Canyon a must too, just fantastic, did the helicopter tour,which landed in the canyon, we did want the later time slot, where you fly back over the strip early evening, but all booked up, so book early if you want this tour! Great shopping malls in all the hotels, the bigger the hotel ie ballagio, caersers etc, really only cater for very rich, all shops designer, but stll great to window shop!! Million Mile mall, in Planet Hollywood, just across from caersers, suits all pockets! Fantastic shows, we saw Jersey Boys at the Palazzo, brilliant. The bigger shows ie Janet Jackson, celion dion, and kylie from may, hard to get tickets, suggest you book well in advince of your trip. Anyone who goes for 4/5 days, In my opinion is just not long enough, 10hr flight there and back takes up 2days of your trip!

The Augustus Tower contains the Qua Spa (whose Roman baths are worth the cost of a day pass, even if you don't get a massage or other treatment), and also is the closest to the front door (because you don't have to navigate a casino area to enter or leave it). The Roman and Centurion Towers are older (I believe the Roman Tower is the oldest), but given the overall condition of the property even they are likely to be nicer than rooms at your average hotel in Las Vegas.

Our flight arrived at 9 a.m., and check-in wasn't until 3 p.m. The bell staff was VERY accomidating and stored our bags for us until we had a room. A few people had posted that they did not get the room that they originally booked . . . so we swung by the front desk to verify our reservation before heading out to sight see. They told us that we could come back for an early check-in at 1 p.m., which was very nice. When we did come back at 1 p.m., they did try to get us to switch towers and take an \"upgrade\" for $60 more in the Augustus Tower, but we opted to stay with our cheaper Forum Tower Deluxe Room. The room was recently renovated. You could see the upgrades in the bathroom the most, with a very nice walk-in shower with two shower heads, and seperate toilet room. The bathroom also had a TV in the mirror, which was a nice touch. The room itself was a nice King Bed room, with a chaise and a chair. The wood furniture had seen better days, and was considerably nicked up. We did also have poor television reception . . . some stations were black and white, and others very grainy. Our Bell Man was very helpful, and let us know that all the items in the fridge and on display on the desk (crackers, chips, coffee) had sensors in the boxes . . . so if you picked one up for more than 10 seconds, it would automaticly be charged to your room. So good to know! Also . . . WiFi, and the coffee in the room were extra . . . So they have a Keurig Machine for your use, but it costs $17 (NO JOKE) for coffee to put in it . . . My suggestion is to bring your own K-Cups from home :-). Another \"extra\" to make note of . . . . use of the gym is $25 a day. Three-days for $50. The fact that you get \"free\" coffee, fruit, water, and yogurt in the gym sorta makes it worth it . . . considering a cup of coffee in your room is $17 . . . but besides that, the gym itself was very nice and well kept with a wide variety of aerobic, weight, yoga, and pilates equipment available . . .

It was the first time of my husband's in Vegas, so it had to be special. We arrived late at night (around 10PM) after a long flight. I've ordered an Augustus tower king non-smoking room, and when we checked-in everything seemed alright - the check in lady was nice, but she said the room we wished for (being on a higher floor and with view to the Bellagio fountains) was not available until tomorrow, and that we should call the next morning and they'll give us the other room. Sounds wonderful, right? so we tipped her nicely (very nicely) and went upstairs. and from then on we spent too much time on bad service. She told us the room we are getting was king-smoking room with non view. Right. So we went in - the room was a twin bed room. (and we're on our honeymoon!). so down we went again. She appologizes, gives us a new room which is suppose to be \"non smoking king, but no view\" (until the one the day after), and sends us up again. Ofc it's the worst smoking smell you've ever smelled, but we were so tired that we didn't care. Not 20 minutes go by, and we get a call from her, saying the room that was saved for us for tomorrow, was no longer available. seriously? she said we'll have to stay there. Yeah, right! It was around 12 am at this point and we were dead tired. I went downstairs and asked to talk to a manager. I explained him the matter and it took him exactly 2 seconds to get us the room we wanted on the first place. All in all, it was just very bad service. At the end we switched rooms the day after, around 3pm (we were told it'll be at 1pm), which meant we had to get back to the hotel in the middle of our day. We felt like half a day was waisted on something that shouldn't have happened. We weren't offered any compensation (and didn't ask for one either).

The clerk said it was the tower that faced the pools. We were excited because we have always faced a roof and Treasure Island - really no view at all. We got to our room (613) and guess what - roof and Treasure Island view. The room was nice - a Deluxe with King bed. Same kind of room we have stayed in in the past.

We got our coffee each morning downstairs at Payard. Go to the express line if you are just getting coffee or a roll. Excellent croissants!!! It was kind of depressing to see so many stores boarded up in Caesars and the Forum. Restaurants: We went to Payard for breakfast every morning as I said above. Went to Rao's one night for dinner.

There were plenty of people complaining about the prices in there the night we were there. It was good, but not that good. Went to Munch Bar for dinner one night. Very good Philly Cheesesteak and burger. Terrible service. There was always a huge line at the buffet. (Hint - if you check in on FB for the buffet you get buy one get one free). Casino: This was the most disappointing part of Caesars for us. I would say 90% of the slots are penny slots now.

So we visited Maria the next day she came through. The rest of the week we had the best view on the strip. Watching the fountains from the 43th floor was beautiful. I did tip her 20 dollars, but that was after she upgraded us. The front desk staff was great, I don't know what some people were talking about. We didn't spend all our time at the hotel, but the time we did spend was great. Really felt we were treated great by every staff member we came in contact with. The pool area was beautiful. There was a great number of different t restaurants. The casino area is a little spread out, but you get use to where you are going after a couple of days. Did ok playing slots. We did spend about 18.00 in the morning for 2 cups of tea and 2 muffins which was a bit much, but it was very confinient. At the end of our stay, I spoke to a casino host, who comped me another night, so we only had to pay for one night. The trick to that is for both you and your significant other should play using the same comp card, so all your points show in one place. And go to the other Harrah properties to play like Paris and Planet Hollywood which were both great fun!", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cNeeds some work to be above average\u201d", "Author": "dmoney72", "ReviewID": "UR104906369", "Content": "First the good: Beds: clean and comfortable.

I booked a deluxe room several months ago at a conference rate (almost $200/night!) and was told check in was a 3pm. I arrived at 3:30. Check in desk was chaos. Hords of people, no lines etc. Was told my room wasn't ready. When asked when it would be ready, I was told \"we can't tell you.\" \"in 1/2 hr? In 2 hrs? at midnight? Is it a secret?\" \"We will call you. Give us your cell number\". I checked hourly and was told multiple different check in times by various staff and by one person \"check in BEGINS at 3, but that is NOT A GUARANTEE. We will call you.\" At 7pm and still wandering around with no room, I asked to speak to a manager. At that point my room suddenly became available. When I asked why they had not called me, the response was \"we sometimes dont get to that\" Got to my room. It was NOT the double room I had requested. Again, I made an enquiry and was told \"When you make a request it is ONLY A REQUEST, NOT A GUARANTEE. Room preferences are done on a first come, first serve basis.\" I explained that I had booked months ago, that I had been wandering around in their hotel for 4 hours and found it hard to believe that this giant hotel had no double rooms. I was offered a cot. A cot at $200/night?!!! I had to raise a huge stink and was finally offered a change of room 2 days later and a $50 credit for food/drink. I was told that I would have to take all my luggage down to the bell desk the morning of the change as it would be inconvenient for the hotel to make the switch for me. $50 credit does not go far. I was shocked to see that the only coffee pot in the room used those coffee capsules which were selling for $12 for 4 servings! Thankfully, the room was clean and nicely furnished with a very large bathroom. Checkout a week later was chaos once again. There was a woman offering automatic electronic check out and was told that an email receipt would be sent. I opted for this, trying to avoid the crowds. The email arrived quickly on my smartphone and was illegible/scrambled. I had to stand in line again. When I informed the electronic check out woman that there was a problem with the email, she was dismissive and rude. When I said that probably people who needed a real receipt should not do the electronic check out, I was told \"don't say that!\" I was attending a conference at this facility and opted to stay here for convenience. Interestingly, the ceiling high scaffolding in the conference room all started falling down on one occasion. No one was hurt and the hotel did provide beer/wine for that mishap. I did visit some other hotels while there which appeared much newer, cleaner etc. It was overpriced (room, coffee! and guests need to pay $25 to use the gym!), incompetent staff, smelly/old casino facilities.

We usually stay at Bally's but for our 48th Anniversary decided to stay at Caesars as a treat. Our rooms were to be comped. On check in at 5PM there was almost no line. When I asked the desk clerk if any of the Forum rooms had a strip view he replied \" You won't be in the Forum Tower\". He said based on our \"level of play we were only entitled to a Roman Tower room\". When I nicely asked why my reservation was for a Forum room he said that there was a convention and they were full so we were moved to a lower category room. When I asked him to check with a supervisor he picked up his phone. After about 15 seconds without ever saying a word he said \"sorry, nothing we can do\". I will say that when we got to the room (#1378) it was big. I estimated the room at about 350 sq. ft. plus the bath area that had a separate shower, tub, small room with both a toilet and bidet. The room had two windows of about 8 ft. wide by 4 ft. tall. One looked out over the swimming pool area the other looked at a blank wall of the next tower. There were lots of large tubes toiletries including Shampoo, Shower Gel, Conditioner and Lotion. There were also two large bars of nice scented soaps. The big find was the grand slam of freebies a Sewing Kit, Personal Needs Kit, Shoe Mitt and Shower Cap. According to CheapoVegas.com these are becoming very rare and elusive. There were also loads of nice fluffy towels. Now the Roman Tower is one of the older towers and has not been updated is ages. The carpet was getting a bit thin and had some spotting but was not nasty, just looked old. The TV was the old style CRT type but filled the needs. The king sized bed was GREAT, just right support and lots of pillows. Very comfy. The furniture, a love seat, two arm chairs, a work desk and various tables were in pretty good condition for their ages. The Bathroom besides being large was very clean. There was a small T.V. next to the sink so we could check out the Weather Channel while getting ready.The maid service kept it sparkling for our entire four day visit. In fact the service personnel were great. Evert time I asked a question they would always reply with a correct detailed answer and a genuine smile. One day the Ice Machine on our floor was empty, when I ask one of the maids where another was located she told me where another was. At that point she said \"let me get the ice for you, you are the guest here\". How Nice and pleasant. Bottom Line is that even though the front desk made me feel less than welcome almost everyone else were superb. I did relate my check in experience to Caesars and received a nice reply from a Ms. Sava. She said that she would \"share my concerns with the front line staff\". Overall after a less than stellar start we had a nice stay. Would I stay here again? Maybe. Caesars is huge, lots of walking.

Where do I start? First of all, my husband was attending a conference & we made our reservations for a king room 4 months in advance at the conference price (which was in the end WAY overpriced). When we arrived we were checked into a double TWIN room. When we made the mistake known to the front desk, they told us; \"We are busy with another big conference, & near sold out. We can see if tomorrow we can accomodate you better?\" It was late & we were both very tired from the 8 hours drive, so we agreed. The next day in between my husband's very important conference, he attempted multiple times to remedy the mistake. Each time he was told \"well, maybe we can change your room this afternoon after housekeeping? But we are near sold out, so we just don't know\" At 1pm the 2nd day of our stay, we were given another room. We packed up all our stuff & made our day to the next, supposedly correct room.....much to our dismay, this room was also....you guessed it.....a double twin. So we slupped our luggage BACK down to the front desk to AGAIN attempt to rectify the mistake. FINALLY, on day 2 our our 3 day stay we obtained the correct room. Albeit, the worst king room they probably had. The view was the dusty, dirty roof of the \"good\" tower. The wall was paper thin, & the drunk guy next door was smoking in the clearly marked \"no smoking\" room. I could actually SEE the smoke wafting under the adjoining door (which incidentally his drunk butt kept trying to open day/night) Each time we encountered the front desk staff, we were met with a smile & \"We're sorry\" but nothing else. I mean seriously?? In the land of competentary hookers & cocaine, you'd think they'd toss us at least a spa or restaurant credit? Doesn't the computer know which rooms are TWIN & which are KING?

Although I didn't get a chance to try the pool, I certainly sat by it a few times in between meetings and it is unbelievably beautiful. Service at the hotel was almost an \"A\", but I'll explain why I couldn't grade it that way in a moment. They must have a few thousand rooms to take care of each day, and I cannot fault housekeeping. I stayed in two different rooms over the course of my three nights, and they were spotless. The rooms come with a mini-bar and flat screen LCD, and the bathroom had a nice marble tub, separate shower and two sinks. Robes were included in both rooms. Rooms were very quiet. Hotel internet is $14.95 a day. If there was one thing I could change about the room? They need feather pillows. The Conceirge desk is terrific. i only have a couple of requests and they met them no problem. I ate at three restaurants: one off the lobby for breakfast, one japanese restaurant called \"9\" and another Italian restaurant whose name I can't remember. I also ordered room service. They all had terrific service. They try really hard here. Onto the 'issues'. One is the Front Desk, they are definitely understaffed. Lineups are enormous, and the front desk counter is so huge they could easily triple the staff at peak periods. I don't understand why they don't. I also had a problem with my bill, which I worked out over the phone for twenty minutes and they resolved it. Unfortunately when I called back less than an hour later to check out (you are allowed to check out over the phone), they had absolutely no record of my previous conversation on file, and my bill was backed to beung messed up again. They actually did not resolve it that time and told me there was nothing they could do (I won't get into the details of the problem but suffice to say it WILL be solved once i return to work and call the manager). The other issue, which I cannot excuse, is the business centre. Only one person staffs it and he is too busy to help, and the computers are hard to use. Yes, I can understand charging $7.50 for 15 minutes computer work - I cannot understand charging a $1.00 a page to print something out. Forget about bringing your own paper - when you send the print command to the printer, it charges you that way. Also, for some strange reason, although there's a number of computers there is only one printer. Lastly, you will see advertisements all over the building for Jerry Seinfeld and Celine Dion. I mean everywhere. What doesn't make sense is that Jerry only performs there FOUR times a year (this is what I was told at the Conceirge desk). Celine was performing the week I was there and although I didn't get to see her, I would have had I had the time. One other thing - there are plenty of SMOKING rooms in this building. I don't smoke, which was a problem as they gave me a SMOKING room on my first night. Now, they made this up to me on my second night by upgrading me. HOWEVER - be clear at the front desk that you want a non-smoking room. I was, and there was still a mistake made. So you should verify when they had you the room key. None of these issues would prevent me from staying there again, unless I knew I was going to need heavy usage of the business center (then I would definitely stay somewhere else).

Being it is the original tower in the hotel, the rest of the hotel/resort has grown around it, consequently there are a couple of drawbacks. Our view of the air conditioning system was fabulous (if you like that sort of thing) and the walk from the self park to check in is through the casino and quite a long walk, other than that, there aren't many complaints. The room was large, clean and well maintained. Yes it is an old tube T.V. but I had stayed at Paris the week before and they had a tube T.V. as well. If you're going to Vegas to watch T.V. then you should inquire before hand to find out the style and size of the Television. As for a coffee maker, very few hotels in Las Vegas provide one in the room. The bathroom was a nice size with nice amenities (large shampoo/conditioner/lotions/mini sewing kit etc.) and a small lcd T.V. on the wall. The closet was in the bathroom which is perfect, you could hang your clothes and the steam from the shower would remove the wrinkles. Because it's the original tower in the hotel, there aren't that may rooms per floor and only 14 or 15 floors (I think) so the the wait for an elevator is minimal and there isn't much traffic going up and down the hall so it's a bit quieter.

This was our third time in Vegas, but our first stay at Caesars Palace and will be our last. My husband and I stayed at Caesars Palace 2/20/11-2/24/11. We had all four night comped in a Classic Room using our Total Rewards players card. Upon arrival to the hotel, it was 2 p.m. and we were worried that there would be huge lines as described by other travelers. Nope, the lobby was empty. We walked right up to the front desk and were able to check in immediately. We inquired about complimentary upgrades, but were told that the hotel was actually overbooked due to it being President's week and the many conventions that were staying there. We were offered a suite upgrade between $100-$200 per night. Knowing we would not be spending a lot of time in the room, we declined and kept our free room. We were on the 12th floor of the Roman Tower. Very disappointing. It was an oversized standard room that is in definite need of upgrades. Flatscreen tv? No, instead an old tube style tv inside an old wooden armoire. Standard desk, small table with wooden chairs, two nightstands and a king size bed. There was no refrigerator or mini-bar. The only saving grace to this room was that the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. So the few hours of sleep a night we actually got was at least restful. The room was also very quiet and had no smoke odor at all. The bathroom was the strangest thing. No door...the entrance was a short hallway. The toilet was in a separate room near the entrance that had an old, rickety, wooden sliding door and a loud annoying fan. Next to that was the oversized shower stall that only had one small soap holder. There was no where to put other toiletries like shampoo. There was a long vanity with one sink and a separate makeup vanity that had poor lighting. A tiny flatscreen tv protruded from the wall near the mirror. Got excited for a moment when I saw a huge oversized tub with whirlpool jets, until I took a closer look. The tub was old and was in desperate need of some bleach. No privacy in the bathroom at all. Once you step out of the shower, you are in full view of anyone near the bed. Glad I was traveling with my husband. Also, all the lighting in the bathroom was on one circuit except for the shower,. So if you had to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, the whole bathroom lit up which then lit up the bedroom. The property itself was just average. Restaurants were overpriced. The bars were comparable in price to others on the strip. We were not impressed with the casino. Felt it lacked variety and availability of slot machines. We only spent the first evening exploring Caesars. The rest of the days we only returned to change and sleep. We enjoyed the many other casinos on the strip. Let me just say that I would have been very upset if we had paid for this Classic Room which can cost quite a bit if you don't have a promotion. If you're lucky enough to be guaranteed a suite or a nicer room, you'll probably have a more enjoyable experience than we did.

Our second clue should have been the scroungy looking guy in a tee shirt and dirty jeans drinking a bottle of budlight while sitting atop the concierge counter. Our third clue should have been the broken exit sign hanging sadly in the hallway with open electrical wires dangling. The suite we stayed in this time was devoid of any artwork rendering the room into a sterile cell. Inside the room, the TV was old box style with perhaps 12 non-premier stations to choose from, no HBO included. The bathroom faucet was completely broken off its base, the wallpaper peeling and crusty, the carpet ripped, torn and shredded in multiple areas. And don't even mention the smoking, every inch of room, the bedspreads, the furniture, the towels, the curtains reeked of heavy cigarette smoke.In the hallways, trays of discarded room service food lingered for more than a day. And then the nickel and diming started: whereas one can get full coffee service, a mini-fridge/bar and free WiFi in a Motel 6: not at Caesers Palace. No coffee service in the room, that requires extra payment. WifFi? Gotta pay for that. Mini-bar? No way unless you want to upgrade and pay extra. Can I print out my boarding pass?

We had been recommended to stay there by friends who had been there a few years ago and mentioned that it was a kitcsh place with people dressed as gladiators walking around. It sounded just what we wanted to experience Las Vegas! However, Caesar's Palace has changed a lot over the years and has been refurbished. We were pleasantly surprised to find that it is actually very classy and not cheesy at all. It is plush and elegant with no sign of people dressed as gladiators walking about. Upon arrival at the hotel (our flight arrived from London at 2pm and we got to the hotel around 3.15pm) we found out at the reception desk that our room wouldn't be ready until 5pm. We thought this odd as our confirmation email stated that check-in was at 3pm (we had booked through expedia). So, our choice was to either hang around in the reception for nearly 2 hours before the room was ready or pay $60 extra per night to get an upgrade and go immediately into the room. After a 10 hour flight, we were exhausted and felt forced to pay for the upgrade as we wanted to rest and freshen up straight away. We don't know if this was a one-off or if it is a common thing that they ask new guests to pay for upgrades upon arrival. Although we were annoyed about this, we soon found out that we had made the right decision (at the unforseeable extra cost though). Our room overlooked the water fountains at the Bellagio with magnificent views of the Strip too!! Caesar's Palace is located right in the middle of the strip next to the Bellagio hotel and opposite the Paris hotel. Very good location as you can walk everywhere from here. But the hotel is vast, as are the other hotels on the strip. It takes a good while to walk anywhere. The Deuce bus and the other 24 hour bus stops at or very near Caesar's Palace so there's no trouble getting to/from the hotel. There is also a constant stream of taxis outside the hotel. Our upgraded room was on the 42nd floor overlooking the Bellagio fountains. The room was huge with a king-size bed, plasma tv, mini-bar (don't buy anything from in there though.. it's really expensive!) an en-suite bathroom with jacuzzi, shower, double basins, hair-dryer and full amenities (shampoo, soaps, shower cap, towels etc). There was even a tv in the bathroom! There was also a large sofa area in the bedroom, coffee machine ($12 for 4 cups -very expensive!!), magazines and air conditioning. The hotel itself has a vast casino with the usual fruit machines, craps tables, blackjack, roulette etc. The cafes are a good place for snacks, hot/cold drinks, breakfast etc. There is also a spa, pool and treatment areas.

There was a good selection of restaurants and the spa was good. The reason I have marked this hotel down was the extortionate rate I was charged for making a phone call from the hotel room.

I found out on checkout that I was charged $9.95 per call. This is completely unjustifiable gouging by the hotel and left an extremely bitter taste in my mouth. I am also frustrated by Vegas hotels using the gym / spa as another way to price gouge customers. No resort fee but I did pay $50 for a 3 day gym pass. This pass did not entitle me to use the showers and lockers in the spa. They asked me for another $20 for this. I left my bag in the gym but later found my phone had gone. I know I had it going into the spa area because I was checking Google maps as I was walking in. I can't be sure that not being able to leave my bag in a locker led to my phone disappearing but why didn't they just let me use the locker? Also, you pay for internet in the room.

It advertises itself as being suitable for 4 people, with a sofa bed and a king sized bed. We checked in and my sister tried to get an upgrade, but the fellow at the front desk kindly took her $50 and we got the same room that we booked. I guess that's lesson learned for her. The room had a nice layout, but despite some obvious attempts at upgrades, it looked tired. I called to request that the sofa bed be made up so that I could sleep there. I was told, by a rather snippy woman, that they do not make up sofa beds, but they would leave off sheets for me. I was somewhat aghast. I am staying in a supposed luxury hotel and I am expected to make up my own bed? Anyway, we returned to our room later to find some clean, but stained sheets left for me to make up my own bed. When I pulled out the sofa bed, however, it was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever laid in - even by sofa bed standards. I wound up sleeping on the sofa. We also had a maintenance issue where the door was making a high pitched squealing noise all the time, not just when opening and closing. That was fixed promptly, which was surprising considering their make your own bed attitude. I guess that I am lucky that they didn't just send up a screw driver. After complaining to the front desk to a clerk who had never heard of the fact that the hotel does not make up sofa beds, we were provided with a cot and a credit. That was very nice, but it wasn't enough to get me to be a guest at their hotel again. I would imagine that the newer towers have less tired accommodations.

They relocated us to the Flamingo which sucked... however we did end up staying here for less than 24 hours...so We were on the 42nd floor in the Agustus Tower which overlooked Bellagio and the fountains and gave a magnificent view of the strip all the way around and down the way. The room was huge with small dining area, sitting couch, 2 queen beds, fully stocked mini bar. Be careful if you take stuff out as you get billed for it right away. The bathroom was all marble with stand up shower and jaccuzzi tub with jets...and there was a closed off toilet area. The bathroom was very tranquil and spa like and came with all the ammenities you would need including body wash. Over all we loved the location and the view from our room. However, there was nail clippings on the floor next to the bed & it's really hard to sleep at night because you can hear EVERYTHING going on in the street even being so high. There were a lot of sirens while we were there so that was annoying. Check in was very fast as it was a week day and the concierge desk was also very helpful. There was only one pool open at the time but that was enough because there was hardly anyone at the pool because it was only about 70 degrees out. I would definitely stay in the Agustus Tower again because it's the newest one and it is very easy to get to the lobby/casino from there. You don't have to haul your luggage clear across the casino. Everything at this hotel was enjoyable from the food to the shopping to our great room, except being relocated upon arriving...which I hope never happens again. Be sure to eat at Noodle No. 9 and I would highly recommend NERO. It has something for everyone. It's romantic, fun, trendy...you will love it!

Here are our impressions: The Good: Nice big room, comfortable bed with plenty of pillows, living area that included a desk and an easy chair. Decor was mellow and pretty. Huge bathroom with double jacuzzi tub (only used this to sit in and read when husband wanted to sleep in) and separate glass shower, plus two sinks, large counter area, drawer to put your stuff in (always love that) and a separate room for the toilet. Good water pressure in the shower. Palace Tower is in a central location within the property, so always easy to find and get to from casino or restaurants. Drink service in the casino was fast and efficient. While drinking the first cocktail I thought they were light on the booze, but nope, good pours for our drinks. Really LOVED eating at Rao's Italian Restaurant. It's expensive but soooo good. Loved everything we had (bread, calimari appetizer, salads, pasta and side of meatballs. I will be thinking about those meatballs until we return and I can have them again). We ordered too much and couldn't finish our meals but wished we could have. The coffee/pastry bar downstairs was good too, long lines but they moved fast. Again, expensive but that's what we expected. We love the location of Caesars, right in the middle of a bunch of nice properties that you can walk to. Saw the fountain show at the Bellagio, walked across to the Paris casino and steak house, etc. The Bad: There's a nice dressing area across from the closet with a lamp and a magnifying mirror. They didn't work, turns out the plug under the counter looked like it had burned - there were char marks coming out where the prongs would plug in. So, no good place to apply makeup. Good thing I don't wear much. Our room came equipped with a Sony Dream Machine alarm clock/CD player. Well, someone had preset BOTH alarms for like 5:00 am and then 6:30 am. I travel a lot and am usually really good with the gadgets in hotel rooms but for the life of me I could not figure out how to turn off the alarms. I did figure out that if you press snooze multiple times, each press gives you an extra 10 minutes. This was all going on during a hangover, so I blamed that for why neither of us could turn them off. The second night, I unplugged the Dream Machine and guess what?? It has batteries!!! We ended up putting the dream machine in the closet wrapped in towels until we checked out.....Neither one of us could figure it out, even without hangovers. Our room had a door to an adjoining room and those doors are VERY thin, we knew every time the man next door sneezed, etc. Luckily he wasn't a loud hotel guest, hopefully he felt the same about us. All in all, we felt the issues were minor and we really enjoyed our stay.

They explained the first two nights complimentary and the 3rd would be 60 bucks so we had more spending money for fun. We saw several shows, the red carpet premiere of the Mechanic at Planet Hollywood, then Sin City Comedy(funny also sexy gal) and for my Birthday we ate at Nero's really gourmet food and we saw Matt Goss. I was impressed. You dont have to gamble much if at all but youre given credit with purchases you make as a reward member and thats why they offer specials. They are only good for 6 months so you'd have to visit Vegas atleast twice a year to take advantage of the offers and with Southwest (signup on email)having 29 oway tkt specials from Lax....who could pass this up.

The bathrooms were very nice and clean, with a separate toilet room and a large marble walk in shower with a sitting bench and a rain showerhead. A bath would have been great, but I can't really complain. The shower is big enough for a couple people if you're traveling with your sweetheart. Water pressure was a little low,but I think that's a water conservation measure. The beds were very soft and cushy with nice linens. I personally prefer a firmer mattress, and if you have back problems the soft bed may aggravate that. They were very nice at check in and let our friend who arrived five hours earlier than everyone else check into one room as soon as it was available at about 11:30 am. The other one could not be ready until about 3pm, which was about an hour later than they originally told her at the front desk, but still, they let her check in early so we can't complain.

First off, do not expect to get to your room before 5 or 6:00pm, and that's if they even have a room for you. I booked about 2 months in advance. When I arrived in the afternoon, I was told that check in was not untill 4pm, so i should come back then. I waited untill 4 and tried to check in, and was told my room was still being cleaned, and to check back in half an hour. I came back, in half an hour, only to be told that I had to wait another half an hour. I came back agan, and was told to come back at 6:00, because they guarantee all rooms will be ready by then. I returned at 6:00, only to be told my room was not ready, and I could continue to wait, or be downgraded to a worse room than what i paid for. I had no idea if the room i paid for was ever going to get done, so I agreed to take a cheaper room. The next day, I went to the front desk and asked to be switched to the room I had paid for. I was given keys to a new room, however, when I walked in to the room, someone else's stuff was already in the room. I called down to the lobby and they sent up a person to take me to another room. I was kind of upset with this hotel, due to the fact that numerous hours of my vacation were wasted due to their poor management. I did end up talking to a manager, and they gave us a 50 dollar credit to our room, which we could spend on whatever we wished. This was nice, but to me it did not make up for how they treated us. While i was waiting in line trying to check into my room all those times, i overheard many people trying to check in get upset with various issues. One person's room was not ready, and it caused them to miss some sort of event they had planned. He got pretty upset and demaded to talk to a manager, and ended up yelling at the manager and walking away.

They were transferring us there for the first two nights of the trip and the second two nights we could come back to Caesars (exactly what we wanted to have to do is move hotels midway through our trip). On the plus side, they paid for our first two nights at the Flamingo, gave us $100 in food vouchers at the Flamingo, upgraded our room upon checking back into Caesars Palace, and upon further complaining on our part provided us with another $100 food voucher for Caesars Palace. Caesars was a lovely hotel, but for all the trouble we had to deal with there are a lot of other lovely hotels in Vegas that probably would not have put us through the same back and forth.

What I Liked: - The Front Desk Personnel are very responsive when tipped at time of check in... -I felt like I stepped into a nice condominium when I entered my Jacuzzi Suite in the Palace Tower - Everything was CLEAN, including the all important Jacuzzi which has great water pressure for a fast fill - Separate Shower is upscale, great water pressure and the water is hot as soon as you turn the shower on. - Loved the separate (private) bathroom; it really helps maintain the Spa feeling you get in the opulent bathroom suite. Very Nice. - The View of the Vegas Strip speaks for itself. Awesome. - The bed had large, firm (newer memory foam type feel) pillows with a white, waffle weave pillow case that was very comforting and comfortable. The duvet is done in a matching waffle weave which I really like. Again, a clean, spa-like experience. - The colors in the room are very neutral and soothing but contemporary enough that there is no mistaking you are in Las Vegas. - The floor was super quiet and had a private, upscale feel. I heard others complain about noise and a view of the dumpster. Hint: You gotta pay to play in Vegas. Every thing and ever person is FOR SALE in Vegas. Tips go a long way including five or ten bucks to your Housekeeper. They do a great job and are appreciative of your thoughtfulness. - Wake Up Calls were on the money. - Heating/Cooling System works flawlessly - Room Service is outrageously fast, the fare is very acceptable and the wait staff are real professionals. Be aware that the $5 Room Service Fee and the 20% Gratuity are already included in your Room Service Bill... What I didn't like but I expected... - The Television Channel selection sucks. Naturally, they want you out of that room and in Casino spending money - Coffee is $14 for a 4 Pak of Coffee Pods and one is Decaf. Be prepared for that. Naturally, there is a Starbucks in the Lobby - The Mini Bar will eat you alive. Buyer Beware on that one - Don't expect to find Bottled Water in your room. There isn't any. My best bet was stocking up at The Casino where all beverages are complimentary or bring your own water. - No fans is you are one who sleeps with a fan. Download White Noise for your iPhone/iPad and you are set - No Garment Steamers available. Slight inconvenience. - Internet Access is not free. Be prepared for that or negotiate it into your package... Pick your taxi carefully. My ride from the Airport to the hotel (with gratuity) was $32. The ride from the Hotel to the Airport for my return home was $18 including gratuity. Hmm... All the restaurants and food in general at Caesars Palace is well above average. Not cheap, though and the Table Minimums are not cheap, either. If you want lower buy ins you are better served to hit other Casinos. PURE Nightclub in the property is very nice and off premise stops at The Cosmopolitan and Wynn were first class. Business in Vegas is on the weak side. That makes it a buyer's market.

We were given a room in the Palace Tower on the 9th floor with no view of anything other than rooftops and parkades. According to the front desk a strip view room cannot be guaranteed.

The walls in the bathroom had rust on them, no water pressure, stained tiles, had to request towels as there was only one bath towel, two hand towels and no face cloths. There was still food on the carpet from the previous guest and some foreign sticky matter on the bed skirt. The pop machines on any of the floors did not work as they were supposedly upgrading their machines. They had a note telling you to purchase the pop from the fridge in your room or to order room service. Also, the smell of cigarette smoke is very noticeable through out the whole hotel.

Our family friends came from Toronto, Canada for 5 days to stay with us in Los Angeles and see Las Vegas. When I made our reservations, I asked for 2 non-smoking rooms that are beside each other, and got a confirmation for that. We were a total of 9 people. Before our arrival at Caesar\u2019s, I received a phone call from their reception desk that our rooms are ready and asked us when we will be arriving. When we arrived at the hotel, one of our rooms wasn\u2019t even ready, even though they already called us and asked us when we are getting there. We stayed in the Roman Tower, since we were told that the Roman Tower was entirely non-smoking. We had to kill one hour before we could go into our rooms. So we had to gather 9 people again, and go find somewhere to eat. When we got back to the hotel, the rooms were not beside each other, they were in front of each other, which wasn\u2019t bad either, but one of the rooms was a smoking room, and still had an extremely strong scent from the last people that stayed there who were smoking, and there was a cigarette butt left outside of the room, which was very disgusting. We went back down to the front desk to tell them about the smoking in the room and they sent someone up to get rid of the smell with an ozone smell remover. It didn\u2019t work the first time, but it worked the second time they tried. Unfortunately, even though they used the ozone smell remover, our bed sheets would still smell like cigarettes. The next day we went to the buffet and bought the 24-hour all you can eat buffet pass to seven different hotels, and this was a complete waste of money! We only used it once because its 24 hours from the time that you purchase the ticket, and all the lines of every hotel was so long that we needed up eating at restaurants instead. Each hotel\u2019s buffet was over 4 hours long because they didn\u2019t have enough space to accommodate everyone that bought the tickets, they probably didn\u2019t account for the demand when they made this promotion available. So that was almost $500 (6 people had the player cards so they paid $50 each, and 3 people didn\u2019t so they paid $60 each) to waste. Caesar\u2019s Palace buffet was a waste of time! There was no cream cheese, not enough bagels, no cereal, and not much variety. It was a horrible buffet. Even the food tasted a little funny. I thought Caesar\u2019s Palace was one of the Strip\u2019s best hotels, but in fact it was probably the worst hotel I have ever visited. I will never be going back to Caesar\u2019s ever!

I would highly recommend asking for a humidifier, especially if you have sinus issues with the desert heat. The room was amazing.

This tub came in handy to soak our poor tired feet after a long day of walking up and down the Strip!! We had a nice view of the Mirage and TI. I think we could even see the Rio from our room as well. Staff here was extremely helpful, especially at the Lago Buffet where someone tried to skip us in line. A gentleman came to our rescue before anything escalated and got us right into the buffet, with no delay. It was so nice of him to do that and we greatly appreciated it!! We loved the buffet, especially the breakfast one. We ate at Augustus Cafe many times, as we often do, as it is open 24 hours.

This place is awesome. I stayed here in August, and loved it so much that I had to come back again. I was lucky to get both stays comped, thank you Harrah's Entertainment (now Caesars). OK, here is the review: The room I got was in the Palace tower, mini suite, a really nice room, probably the best room I ever had. The bed and pillows were super cofortable. The bathroom was phenomenal, two bathrooms in one really, with a great (and useful) jetted tub, in addition to a shower stall with dual shower heads. The television is good, flat screen. Stay away from mini fridge, everything sits on sensors and you will get charged if you just pick it up to inspect it. All phone calls, even local, cost money, so use your cell. The view we had was excellent, of the pool complex. The pool complex is one of the best in Vegas. During the winter, off season, only one pool is open, and it is heated. I actually used it one day, it was great. Hardly anyone used it during my stay, most of the time there was light rain. During summer months, the complex is very nice, gets very busy. The drinks at pool side are ridiculously expensive. The only restaurant I tried was their buffet. The food was good, but the service was terrible. The server we had seemed like she didn't care at all to provide any service. Her entire section had plates just piling up a the tables, without her collecting them. The porters in the restaurant were just chatting with each other and not working, my buddy overheard them making rude comments about some customers. One table next to us was left uncleared after customers left for about half hour. I worked in restaurants before and that is just horrible. Some good buffets in Vegas are at Rio, Planet Hollywood, Golden Nugget, MGM grand, and Bellagio. Both my stays I was originally booked in Forum tower, but got upgraded for free to the palace tower. Great night life in this hotel over the weekends. The key in vegas is to be genuinely nice to the employees and to be a bit generous (tip), and good things can happen to you. I checked out the prices of the rooms, if it wasn't comped and to be honest they are a bit too high, I don't think I would stay there if it wasn't comped. I would definitely stay at CP anytime I get the room comped or at a good rate, but would never pay the full advertised room rate.

Now I have heard on this web-site that those rooms were old and tired, so I was kinda upset that that's where they were putting us. He said we could move to the Palace Tower on Monday, so we said ok. Well went to our room in the Roman Tower, and what a pleasant surprise. The view was good, the room was very large, as was the bathroom. Bath did have a small tv by the mirror, which I do like to have on while getting ready. The only thing is that the tv in the room is an old style, but no problem. Monday I went to change our room to the Palace and this time the guy said \"that's not going to happen\". So he gave us a room in the Forum Tower, as we were originally were booked. The only reason we wanted to change rooms was to compare the two. Anyway, moved rooms. This room was alot smaller, but did have the tv in mirroe, and flat screen in the room. This room had no view. To tell you the truth, we should have just stayed in the original. room. When we moved rooms, I left my jeans (that I only wore once on the plane) and tried every way to get them back with no luck. Called lost and found, went to the room (they did have guests staying in it) knocked, no one answered, left them a note, called that room and left a message. So, I was out a brand new pair of jeans, grrrr. Ate at the cafe for breakfast, $50, yikes. Ate the breakfast buffet twice, which was pretty good, except very cold eggs the second time. Kept going around in circles in the casino. And they have a lot of wasted floor space. Table limits are too high. Saw Jerry Seinfield, very good show!! So we normally stay at Harrahs, and played our table games there. Now we have tried CP, but won't stay there again. Just wasn't the same as our beloved Harrah's.

Also, did go to Qua for a massage, that I got for Christmas. Lovely place and good massage. However, the mousse product for my hair was awful. Left it like straw, had to go back to my room and re-wash my hair. Also, the casino was not that fun and exciting, like Harrahs, which is always bustling with people. And, so many children.

Forth Room (still in Roman Tower again all 4 were) this one was OK apart from no door on the bathroom\\toilet again, resigned to live with this and crazy shouting lady next door, agreed to live with this too. Connecting doors on either side of the room very noisy, could hear everything. Not at any point was there an apology, offer of a room upgrade at less cost than initial $40 pn, didn't want something for nothing, just the basic room I paid for, but peace and quiet to be able to sleep. On a positive note, was clean, no housekeeping trouble, air con worked, nice bath and lovely powerful shower. No maintenance issues in last room either, until the last day. Whether this had been happening all week we don;t know, we returned to our room and the door was not locked it was shut but the lock hadn't activited so the door pushed open. We fiddled with it for 5 mins and it finally locked, not worth complaning about on last night. So when left room that night had to really bang the door hard a few times to get the lock to kick in - i would worry about safety in this hotel. Very poor security generally, did not see any security, other hotels has key activiated lifts or security checking for room keys at lifts but not here. I felt I was treated without respect by the front desk staff. Bell staff, housekeeping and maintenance were fine. They have obviously made cut backs on staff and it shows particuarly with maintenance in the rooms. It was clear that room 1471 would just be cleaned and re-let, we shall see if someone else reviews it. Stay away unless you can get an upgrade, which to be honest if you can afford better to stay in one of the new hotels like Aria. I dont mind older rooms and less up to date decor it's a room who cares, but I want something safe, that works and that I can sleep in, not much to ask surely?", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ramsey, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cVegas IS cheesy.....but I LOVE it!!\u201d", "Author": "DanFromHades", "ReviewID": "UR91200928", "Content": "Now THIS is a hotel!!

We originally booked a Classic room but upgraded to a Forum room before arriving. I hear there not so great. The lady asked us at check in if we would like to upgrade. We jokingly ask \u201cIs it free?\u201d she just gave us a blank series stare\u2026 wow.. easy. Ahahah. So I asked how much and she said $40 a night.

Though, they did a great job. Any employees in the hall or elevator etc would make a point of checking to see that everything was ok. Room: The room was fine. Nothing really wrong with it. Glad we didn\u2019t waste the money on an upgrade. The bathroom was large. It was one main room, with a closet, Basin sink, large standup shower with two rain heads and a mirror with built in TV. There was a small room off of this with the toilet. The bedroom was an ok size, not too small, but not huge. It had a desk and chair. King bed which was super comfortable except I found the pillows to thick. (That\u2019s just me though) and two lounge chairs. We had a room at the end of the hall on a higher floor.

I was offered a room at the hotel at a good \"conference\" rate and was pretty excited to be able to stay at Caesars - \"oh, that will be really nice, Caesar's is one of the more upscale of the hotel/casinos in Vegas\" everyone told me. Wow, what a miserable experience. After a 10-hour day of sightseeing/scenic driving on the way back to Vegas for my conference (I flew to Vegas from the east coast but had rented a car to do a bunch of sightseeing for a few days in Utah at Zion/Bryce/Capitol Reef) I tried to figure out where to park to check-in for Caesars and did nothing except upset the valets and taxis who shooed me \"you can't stop here go park.\" So I had to go park in the big garage, walk approx. 8-10 minutes through two casino floors (and beg for directions from some casino floor worker through the meandering maze with vague wayfinding posts) to find my way from self-park to the registration desk. When I asked the woman at registration if there was a place to stop to unload my bags first and then go self-park she looked at me like I had three heads and snarled, \"no, there's the valet but there's, like, no, there's no place to just park so you can drop off your bags, no. The bellman will help you with your bags.\" So I checking in was about a 45-50 minute ordeal walking back and forth to the car three times: car --> registration --> car --> hotel room with one heavy bag --> car --> hotel room with heavy bag #2, each time walking probably 1/3 mile. The Bell Desk had such a long line it would have been useless and I have to say that the entire 4 days I was there I never once saw a bellman helping a single guest with bags. I did notice later in the week many other poor, sad, tired, lost-looking folks dragging huge suitcases across the smoky, meandering casinos. They put me in the Roman Tower - which I later figured out from reviews here is one of the two dumpiest towers. Wish I had checked TripAdvisor ahead of time. My room hadn't been renovated in at least 15-20 years. Everything was old, banged up, cracked, the door rim on the bathroom door was falling off. Both beds were so old they had a dip in them and I could feel the springs. I ended up stripping the one bed and rotating and flipping the mattress to a side that was less worn so I could sleep. The one thing that I thought would redeem the room - the jetted tub - blew pieces of dark greenish mold into the tub when activated! Disgusting! I lept out of the tub dripping wet and nearly screaming. Truly vile. I had to call housekeeping to clean the tub and I was pretty skeeved taking a shower. The TV was ancient and picture was terrible. I know you're not supposed to be in your room watching TV in Vegas, but I wanted to unwind with it a couple of nights... and as you'll read if you search other reviews, there were adjoining doors to both sides and I could everything going on next to me. Finally, I understand perhaps no fridge or microwave but no coffeemaker? Seriously? I count on having a cup brewing while I'm in the shower. (I ended up going out to get some Starbucks Via and using the super hot water from the tap to make coffee the remaining mornings a mug I had with me.) Everything in Caesar's is overpriced. Thank goodness my company was paying. I also got hit with the \"would you like to upgrade to an XYZ fancier room?\" on check-in (umm, no, I'm here on the conference rate - a.k.a. my company is paying and they're not gonna approve an upgrade.) The \"would you like to upgrade...\" went on for four days straight. I couldn't request a wake-up call without having the operator ask me if I'd like to place a room service breakfast order. $15/day for internet. $20-something to use the fitness center... Caesar's nickel and dimes you at every turn. When I tried to ask the hostess at Beijing Noodle 9 for some suggestions from the menu, she acted like it was a big inconvenience, confused me into asking a dumb question (that I was pretty sure was a dumb question but she was the one making no sense), then went over to place my order and I noticed her talking to the cook and he was looking at me and laughing. After my horrible check-in experience and horrible experience at Beijing Noodle, I made sure that all of my discretionary spending on meals, gambling and entertainment went elsewhere - mostly the MGM Grand, and TI (where I took in Mystere and Ka) and New York, New York. I ended my stay at Caesars a day early (an extra day I was staying to sightsee on my own dime) to find something nicer and cheaper (half price!) for one night. I've been to Vegas before and stayed at Luxor, which was a great experience, and the Sahara, which despite being one of the cheaper strip establishments was still a better experience than Caesars. Unless you are a high-rolling VIP with money to burn stay away from Caesars. They ripped off my company for $149/night on a piece of crap room and when I later did some research I found out I could have gotten a nice deal at many of the other strip hotels for half that -- Luxor, MGM, Mirage, Monte Carlo etc. are all offering good deals to get your business -- and I would have probably had a better experience.

I came back an hour and a half later (past check-in time) and was told my room was still not ready and to check back in a half hour. 30 minutes later, the room was finally ready. I asked the bell desk to bring my bags to my room. When I entered the room, there were someones baggage in the room and the room was not clean. It looked like they checked me into someone elses room. I called the front desk and they told me to go to another room and they would send security up with new keys. I told them that I had asked the bell desk to bring my bags up and that they would be delivered to the wrong room. The person at the front desk said she would let the bell desk know of the room change. I went to the new room and waited 20 minutes for security to arrive with the new keys. I went into the room and decided to call the bell desk to make sure my bags were being delivered to the right room. The bell desk told me they had already delivered my bags to the wrong room. I told them what had happened and they said they would get the bags. 25 minutes later, a bell desk person calls from the other room and asks me which bags are mine. I walked over and met him at the wrong room so I could make sure I got the right bags. I immediately checked them to make sure someone hadn't gone through my bags and taken something out - everything was still there. The room I was staying in was a mini suite. The in-room safe (important for Las Vegas) wasn't working. The sink handles in the bathroom did not stop so they would turn all the way around - you had to carefully position them to turn the water off. Internet access was $15 a day. Finally, every day it would take hours for the housekeeping staff to make up the room even though I would call down at 8 AM to ask for service.

However, when we turned down the bed before going to sleep on our first night there, it was clear that the sheets had not been changed. It took housekeeping an hour to come up (after being told 3 times on the phone that someone would be right up). Service at the hotel is not what it should be for a hotel in that price range. Check-in and check-out were chaotic. The front desk seems very understaffed and there were no clear lines for people to stand on. We went for a drink at one of the lounges in the casino area. There was one waitress visible and after waiting for 15 minutes and not getting her attention, we gave up and went to another hotel. For those who need to use the hotel's wireless network - the charge is $15 per day and the network was very slow. In 2010, no hotel, and particularly no hotel with rooms at Caesar's prices, should charge its guests for Internet access. Caesar's is a very noisy hotel in the public areas. There is always loud music blaring through the casino area. The hotel lacks a quiet place to have a drink, unlike some of the other hotels. We chose to spend our evenings at the Bellagio, which for us had a much more pleasant atmosphere, nicer places to have a drink and $10 blackjack tables (absent at Caesar's). However, the room itself was extremely quiet. If you're looking for a beautiful hotel in the heart of the Strip with lots of restaurants, shopping and an energetic casino vibe, you'll like Caesar's. If you're looking for a hotel with restaurants and shopping, but with a more upscale feel and excellent customer service, try another hotel.", "Date": "December 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cCaesar's Palace is gorgeous!

What a mistake that turned out to be. When I arrived at the hotel desk around 9 at night I was told that the room I had requested was not available and I would have to be given a different room. (Even though I had a confirmed late arrival reservation) Now correct me if I'm wrong but I would think that a hotel RESERVATION would mean that my room is RESERVED for me, but I digress. Since it was a long day and flight I took the room that they had and was given a room with 2 Queen beds in it, instead of the King I requested. When I arrived in the room, I found that there was NO ceiling lights in it, yes my friends, the only light you get is from a lamp in the corner. As well there was no closet to hang up clothes, there WAS however a bar located in the bathroom where you can hang up clothes. Just what every traveller wants right. I called the front desk and told them that this room wouldn't do and they told me I couldn't be moved that night as they were full (in a place that size I highly doubt that could EVER happen) and to call back in the morning to switch. I called back the next morning only to have them try and talk me into an \"upgrade\" to a room with a CLOSET in it. I said that this is unacceptable (I mean even a Motel 6 has a closet in it, not to mention lights and usually free Wifi in your room, AND it costs about 1/4 of the price) and after much hemming and hawing I was finally given another room at the property, I went to that room and while it had lights, the beds were now DOUBLES. (down from my original CONFIRMED King sized reservation). Oh yes, and there was no blanket ON the bed, just the sheet and top sheet. I guess I had to trade off for the closet and ceiling lights luxury I was getting. When I went to lie in the bed I found that there were blood stains (I kid you not) on the pillow and sheets. I left that bed and went to the other which seemed to be fine. I left a note for the staff that I would like the bloody sheets changed and blankets on the bed, I got blankets the next day, on the bed, folded and wrapped in plastic, I had to MAKE the bed myself. All in all I would really not advise anyone to go to this property when there are literally hundreds of other properties around the area and many of them with MUCH better rooms than this property. Or, if you DO choose this property, make sure you spend at least $500 a night to get a GOOD room (one that is clean, has lights, blankets, a closet, a decent sized bed, etc) because apparently the $160 a night rooms are dumps.

We particularly enjoy eating at Rao's and the Cheesecake Factory both found inside Caesars. We also enjoy shopping at the Apple Store found in the Caesar's forums. This time we visited our three favorite spots. Rao's as always had good food. Unfortunately they placed us at a table near the kitchen. I made reservations about a month before our intended arrival. I was not happy as we were celebrating my husband's birthday. It would have been nice to eat somewhere away from the kitchen. The Cheesecake Factory. This time we enjoyed a light snack of stuffed mushrooms and corn fritters. The stuffed mushrooms were divine! As to the hotel: Housekeeping just isn't like it used to be. They did not get around to cleaning our rooms until 4 p.m. I asked for some fresh towels and nothing more. As it was so late in the day there was no need to make up the bed. By-the-way Caesars does not change sheets daily as there is a water conservation effort encouraging this effort. Casino: Do not expect to find any low cost Black Jack tables. The lowest minimum bid accepted at the Black Jack tables is $15. This was mid-week and in former days this was when you could find inexpensive tables to gamble at. Do not expect a 3 to 2 pay out either if you manage to get a Black Jack. Caesars does not pay out the 3 to 2 winnings anymore. Internet: Expect to pay $14.99 for 24 hours of Internet service. Also, I do believe the Internet connection is unsecured. Bring an ethernet cord as I think you can use an ethernet outlet. Ethernet cords are not provided by the hotel. Coffee: You can pay for the coffee as it's not free either. Friendliness: Both the hotel and casino seemed to lack the friendliness of yesteryear. Room: Both nights mysterious beeping sounds emitted presumably from the TV. The first night the hotel engineer could find nothing wrong and suggested Cox Cable was working on the cable system causing the beeps. One of the lamps never worked the whole time we were there and the curtains electronic system worked sporadically. We are re-thinking our trips to Las Vegas based on the above.

We just spent Thanksgiving weekend in Vegas where my wife's family lives. We thought we'd make it into a nice vacation too and got a room at Caesars. We'd never stayed here before and were really looking forward to it. It started off pretty good, then rapidly descended to one of the worst stays I've ever had. When we arrived, the Valet sign at registration said it was full. WTF?! I told my wife to just stay there and I ran in to get our room. I upgraded to the Augustus Tower Deluxe room and ran out. Luckily, the valet went ahead and took the car and it was a relatively short walk to the room. The room itself was actually really nice. Great jacuzzi tub and a nice bed. The pillows were worn out feather pillows that needed to be replaced, but the rest of it was nice and had a cool modern look. You have to pay for the coffee, which I thought was pretty ghetto considering every other hotel I've ever stayed in gives you free coffee, but that's the kind of crap I expect in Vegas. Then things start their rapid decent. We ordered room service. My stomach has still not fully forgiven me for that mistake. We got fried chicken and a chicken soup. The soup was good. The fried chicken was something that they pulled from a KFC dumpster, stuck under a heat lamp for 5 hours then took up to our room. It came with a discus... oh sorry, that's right, it was a biscuit. Took a bit and a liter of water later could finally resume conversation. Eating a tablespoon of all purpose flour would have been preferable. I got to spend most of the next morning in the bathroom thanks to that meal. Needless to say, we stuck to the restaurants from then on -- Payard is actually quite good. Then next batch of horror was coming and going to the resort, since we were visiting my wife's family we had some visiting to do everyday. Well, the valet at registration was ALWAYS full! So they made us go to the colosseum area -- on the opposite side of the resort from our room! It was at least a 15-20 minute walk every time we needed to go back and forth from the car. Had I not upgraded to the fancy new tower, maybe that would have been better, but as it was it made us dread coming back every day. Long day, exhausted, sleepy -- no worries, have a nice 20 minute walk, cross two separate elevators, go through two smoky casino areas to get to your room! Methinks not. We also discovered that we started feeling sick once we got there. After the second day we realized it was the heater in the room. Once we turned it off I started feeling better immediately. It was a little too late for my wife though who now has the flu that I blame completely on Caesars. Every time that heater kicked on I started feeling congested and a sore throat -- maybe because they are still doing construction? Don't know, don't care, it's just unacceptable.

I choose to stay at Caesars, as I am a Harrah's Rewards card holder and got a great deal on a room for the week. Two years ago I was in Las Vegas for the same conference and stayed at Harrah's. There is absolutely no comparison between Harrah's and Caesars - Caesars is a much nicer place with better restaurants, facilities, rooms, a nicer casino, etcetera. My room in the Forum Tower was very clean, modern, and quiet. The bed was very comfortable. The \"rain\" shower was great. The TV built in to the bathroom mirror was a bit over the top. The thing I loved about Caesars was the staff. Everyone, and I mean everyone, bent over backward to make you feel welcome. It started from the moment you arrived on property. The bell staff; the front desk staff; the folks in the stores - everyone was pleasant and accomodating. A word about the dealers in the casino - they were, without exception, fantastic. These are \"old time\" Las Vegas dealers who talk to the players; give advice; teach the \"rules\" to to those who are new to the game. It was a joy to play with all of them. They keep things interesting - even when you may not be winning. They are a tremendous asset to Harrah's Corporation, and Harrah's should be mindful of that as they hire new dealers and train them. We ate at Bobby Flay's in Caesars. The food was very good. We also ate at Joe's Stone Crabs in the Forum Shops at Caesars where the food was incredible. Joe's is probably my favorite restaurant in the world, Off property restaurants we tried were: -Sea - Thai food at Bally's - very good and very reasonable; -The Range Steakhouse at Harrah's - excellent but expensive; -Mon Ami Gabi at Paris Hotel - food was ok, not great and fairly expensive; and -Zeffirino at the Venitian Hotel - excellent Italian food and great service. My one knock on Caesars is the way they nickle and dime you for everything - $15 per day for in room internet service; $5 for a cup of coffee in the food court; $25 per day if you want to use the gym; $7.00 handling fee to send a Fed Ex package from the business center back to my office.

Checked in very late in the evening/early morning, and was offered a Roman Tower room (reservation was for Forum Tower). Thanks, but no. Second offer was for a smoking Palace Tower room with the promise that housekeeping would come quickly to fumigate. We took the smoking room even though we are non-smokers. Room 1719 was nice and it didn't smell at all. In fact, even though it was a smoking floor, we never noticed any smell at all. When housekeeping showed up to spray the room deodorizer, we sent them away, as there was no need. The room was very clean and everything was in working order. The bathroom has a separate shower with a large spa type tub. Separate toilet area. The room was exactly the same as our room over the summer, except this room had a coffee maker. We never used it, but it could be handy for those that need their early AM java. Housekeeping showed up early each day and did a good job of providing us with enough towels. The only glitch in our stay was three days into our reservation, a CP hotel employee showed up at the door asking if I was \"staying in the room\". Um, why else would I be answering the door? He had a clip board and pointed to it stating that his records showed our room as being vacant and he wanted to know why I was there. I explained that we had two additional days to go before checking out and I didn't know why he showed us as having left. He talked to someone on his headset and they must have confirmed that yes, we were indeed still registered and were checking out in two days. I was annoyed by the visit and immediately called down to the front desk. The person answering the phone said \"yes, Mrs. XYZ, we show you as checking out on Wednesday (not Monday)\". Thought it was all over until I went to check out on Wednesday and was told by the front desk person that they had cleared my account/charged my credit card on the Monday of the weird visit. Still can't figure out what happened and the whole thing sorta left a bad impression on me.

Room was very nice, clean, and large. Had jacuzzi and separate shower and two sinks in bathroom. My only complaint is that for some reason the sheets felt like sandpaper, although the comforter and pillows were just fine. Room was quiet and I slept well though. Beware the minibar. The cheapest item is $12, and we were told by the front desk that if you pick up an item for over 5 seconds you have bought it. Pricing is not on the items, so of course your instinct would be to pick up the item to see the price since they are all boxed and you cannot see what is in the box at a glance. Concierge was not very helpful and was unable to recommend a restaurant, except for the ones at Caesars. Was going to a show at Treasure Island (2 doors down) but concierge could not tell us anywhere to eat outside Caesars. She also was unable to provide any information on times for the volcano at the Mirage (next door) or the pirate show at Treasure Island. She did not seem very well informed. The main drawback here is the cigarette smoke. Due to the number of casinos and the fact that you have to go through them to get to your room or any of the shopping or eating places at Caesars, you are constantly breathing in cigarette smoke from the casinos. While eating in a restaurant, we could see thick smoke hanging in the air. I was there on business, and you could even smell cigarette smoke outside the meeting rooms. As an allergy/asthma sufferer I was miserable my entire stay, and came home with a nasty sinus infection.

Booked direct with the hotel on their website and got a discounted internet room rate in the Roman Tower but we upgraded at check-in to a room in the Palace Tower for an extra $56.00 (incl tax). Unfortunately I wasn't cheeky enough to ask for an upgrade at no charge. The only problem with the Palace Tower is that it's a bit of hike but I'm not surprised because it's a very large casino. The room was very large with two queen beds, desk, chair & stool, flat screen TV, sensored minibar, two toilets, extra large shower with two shower nozzles (wow), huge whirlpool bath and lovely amenities including a sewing kit. The room was spotless and the housekeeping was completed efficiently everyday. The bed & pillows were so comfortable that everynight we had a wonderful sleep. Our room was very clean and the sheets were spotless and felt lovely. Our room was on the 26th floor and we could not hear any noise from other rooms. Our view from our window was of the pools even though we were hardly ever in our room. The pools close at 5pm and there was only two pools open because of the season, so make sure you get in early or you won't get a lounger. My 9 year old son just loved swimming in the pools. My dissatisfaction with the room is the sensored minibar - We were charged $12 for something we didn't even drink and I only found this once I had paid the bill. When we arrived in our room my young son picked up a bottle of something and we didn't realise the minibar was sensored and that I had to pay $14.99 per 24 hrs for internet access which I think is a bit steep. The great thing about this casino is that parking is free and you can valet park for a tip. The best floor to park for the casino entrance is Level 3. We wouldn't recommend the Lago Buffet at Caesars it's not that great but definitely try the buffet at Planet Hollywood, it's wonderful! If you purchase the $39.95 + tax (24hr buffet pass) don't let your children take off the bracelet because we were told by the hostess that if they did take off the bracelet then all we would have to do is show our receipt. Well that was not true!! One of our son's took off his bracelet making the barcode unscannable and they made us buy another pass.

My wife and I stayed for 4 nights. We were at Caesars to attend a business seminar on Fri/Sat. We received an e-mail prior to arrival offering to upgrade our room for $20-$30 a night. We decided to take advantage of this at check in. Nicole at the front desk explained that the upgrade was not available the first night, but she locked in a room change, and we would be upgraded to the Augustus Tower on Friday, for the rest of our stay. She instucted us to call the front desk around lunch on Friday. So as I am on my lunch break from my meeting, I stop at the front desk, where I am helped by Jason. He checks our info and says we can have a room on the 45th floor or 30th floor in the Augustus Tower. Since I love the views, I said I would take the room on the 45th. He said the room was not ready yet, but I can come back as soon as my seminar is over to get the keys. So the seminar ends at 5pm and my wife and I return to our room in the dumpy Roman Tower, pack up our stuff, and lug our suitcase and bags down to the front desk. I see Jason is still there, and greet him, and tell him we are here get our keys for the room on the 45th floor. He gives me a vacant look, like he is not sure what I am referring to. I remind him he helped me just 3 hours ago. He checks his screen and without a word, disappears for about 10 minutes. So I know something is up...... He comes back saying that no room is available, that \"the system\" released my room. I calmly respond saying how I was confused, and that he and Nicole assured us a room change was set, and he even gave me a choice of rooms. My wife also calmly stated \"that doesn't make sense.\" All of the sudden, the previously helpful Jason gets quite defensive and accuses my wife of \"not listening to him\" and asks her if she would rather \"get upset and yell or listen to him.\" (she said just one sentence) This was totally uncalled for as my wife was calm. If she did get upset, believe me Jason and the entire lobby would have known it! So we ask for a manager, and he says \"fine, but she is just going to say the same thing I told you.\" Another 10 minutes later she comes out to say no to the room change, and that when we checked in Nicole should not have told us we could upgrade. She completely blamed Nicole and said she would need to speak to her. I ask her why does Caesars send e-mails offering upgrades and she has no response other than \"the system\" released the room. She does give us $50 off that night for our trouble of packing up and lugging our stuff down to the lobby. I have read so many other reviews of people getting room changes here. I was most bothered by this Jason's attitude. He really got pricky. We were quite bummed to head back to the Roman tower as the room in the Roman tower was nothing special. The hair dryer was actually in 2 pieces and when I tried to put it back together, I actually got a nice shock. Also no door on the bathroom, which is bizarre....really dont like going in front of my wife. You can hear everything from the room next to you. The whole Roman Tower just has an old, dirty feel to it. To bad their website did not give a clue about the disparity of the different towers. I am sure if we did end up in the Augustus Tower I would be writing a much better review. Rooms are apparently much larger and it was built in 2005. I have stayed at the Venetian previously and wrongly assumed all rooms would be as nice as theirs.

The room has a TV in the bathroom with a 2 person whirlpool tub, but watch out for the obligatory minibar, dont move anything or you will be charged for it, although its a bit much when they now have minibar items on the counter, which cant be moved either, it would easy to accidentally move them. Hey the place is just classy looking even in the hallways, the pool area is out of this world ans triking looking, although one thing I noticed is that during the autumn with the sun not directly overhead anymore, vast stretches of the pool area are shaded most of the day which can be a problem when its 80 degrees or below as it was when I was there. Didnt try the buffet but the Augustus Cafe was a cut above most coffee shops. The food was better than average and they actually took the time to present the food in a pleasing way which I found shocking for a coffee shop. The Forum shops were excellent, ate one night at Trevi there which had slightly offbeat Italian food, quite good. The casino is a little disjointed looking in spots and slightly small but it otherwise ok (slots are definitely tight but then again we go to Sams Town for better odds anyway) My theory is always go for a room thats not a standard room especially at a casino hotel, since you get what you pay for. I've stayed at Caesars in atlantic city, tahoe and now here and when you pay the least, you can get the least. so dont do that , splurge a little and you will always get your moneys worth at caesars, even if it is a bit more than other hotels.", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anacortes, Washington", "Title": "\u201cNo Palace in my book\u201d", "Author": "MitchFindlay", "ReviewID": "UR85663908", "Content": "We were spending time with a group of friends celebrating a couple of birthdays.

He was extremely apologetic and immediately changed my room to one of the newly refurbished ones on the upper floors of the Forum Tower. I told him that I would move myself and was off the inspect the new digs. It was a great room with a Strip view and very nicely appointed. I guess it pays to speak up; but Caesars really did accommodate me with a very nice room and a premium view. Frankly, it is time to do something with the rooms in the Roman Tower. If the room that I was given on the tenth floor is any indication of the conditions of the rooms in that tower, Caesars should be ashamed to claim them as their own. They are old, dull, worn and dated. No modern fixtures, torn wallpaper, aged furnishings and just plain old.

Although we have been before, we usually stay at a lower level hotel (Bally's, Excalibur, etc). This time, however, my husband booked on Hotwire and selected a 4.5 star level. When we arrived, there was a sign stating that valet was full. Looking back we probably could have let them know that we were guests of the hotel and they would have let us in, but we didn't want to push it. As it was the taxis were blocking us in and trying to fit. My husband rolled down the window to ask an attendant (who didn't bother acknowledging us when we drove up) the best way to get to self parking from where we were. The attendant was very short with us and told us to just \u201cdrive around\u201d. We did and after some serious ally driving found our way to the parking garage. Upon entering the garage, the sign said that self parking was levels 3-5, however, on the way up the ramp, levels 3 and 4 were blocked off. When we got to level 5, it was completely full, so we thought we\u2019d maybe be able to go down to 4 and have some way to get in. We actually ended up out of the garage and had to try again. We finally found a parking spot on level 4 and we thought it was close to the elevators. We unloaded the car and walked over. There was no signage telling which level had hotel/casino access so we tried our luck with level 1. Upon exiting the elevator we found ourselves behind the casino in the staff entrance area: back to the elevators. Some very nice ladies (I believe they worked in the spa) showed us that the elevators we needed were actually in the opposite corner of the parking structure, so we set off. This time, we saw signs that said Casino with an arrow, but the signs were about 3 feet off the ground and obscured by the parked cars. We finally arrived at what we thought was the correct elevator; a sign outside the elevator stated \u201cCasino access Level 3\u201d. We thought this must be the spot. Down to level 3, we found that we were still in the parking structure, still with no way to get into the casino and still with arrows pointing to another elevator. Finally to the 3rd elevator, which definitely felt more like a casino, however there was no signage telling us whether to go up or down, the elevators were all full and we finally just had to jump on one and ride up until we could go down. The only sign that pointed to casino access in the elevator was the letter \u201cC\u201d as one of the button options. We were not alone in our quandary and actually had 2 other couples in the same situation we were in the parking structure. Once in the casino, we needed to get to the front desk. Not every signpost has a sign pointing to registration so it was kind of hit and miss. We asked a bellman who was walking through the casino where we could find the front desk and were told, \u201cIt\u2019s at the front,\u201d before he hurried off. Finally, we reached the front desk and were, after several minutes of waiting, greeted by a concierge. We told her we did not plan on ever staying with Caesars again even though this was our first time. When we recounted the short version of our story, she told us that as a walking concierge, she walks all over the casino floor and there are signs everywhere. We decided not to push the issue any further with the lady who checked us in. Finally, after over an hour (from the time we tried to valet park) we were in our room. In my opinion, this is no 4.5 star hotel. The glasses had lipstick on them, the shower head was coming off the wall, the TV was a very old model, we had no view other than the roof of the casino, we could hear anyone in the hall as well as our neighbors on both sides, and it took over 20 minutes for room service to bring us a bucket of ice. I will be avoiding Caesar\u2019s Palace in my future stays in Las Vegas.

The conference rate for a room was $159/night which was for a room with separate men/women baths in the Palace Tower. I tipped the desk clerk $50 to get an upgrade; he made a phone call; told me he had pulled a few strings to get us a junior suite. When we arrived at the room; it was nothing more than the room that was originally reserved - so the $50 tip was a waste. I had requested a room with a king size bed, but the room had two queen size beds, but since it was already very late, any bed looked good. The room was a large room and my wife appreciated the separate bathrooms - it also had a large walk-in shower. The internet at an extra $15/day worked fine. Overall the room was very nice and was clean. My wife enjoyed sitting by the pool, but since it was cool and rainy most of the week, there were never many people at the pool. The pool closed in late afternoon, so I didn't have an opportunity to use the pool. Good luck finding any nearby restaurant, not to mention a reasonably priced restaurant or even one with good food. Within a mile walk of the front door of Caesars, there are two malls with fast food joints. I ate breakfast twice at a cafe in Caesars that wasn't too pricey - about $15 for breakfast, milk and coffee. My wife and I ate at Mesa Grill one night - this is not tex-mex food by any means and it's very expensive. My simple meal of one drink, a salad and a meat entree was $70. We went to see Jersey Boys one night. I paid $155 per ticket; it was a very good show. The acting and music were excellent. From what I could tell the instruments were live, but the lyrics on some of the songs were lip-sync'ed. With the reserved seats, we arrived 10 minutes before the show and easily found our seats, which were 4 rows behind the orchestra pit, except there is not an orchestra pit, so we were really in row 20. The yellow section noted on the Pallazio website is just seating for casino VIP's. We also went to see Vegas the Show for a discount price for general admission tickets of $64 per ticket. The dancing was very good, but the music was poor. They should add some cast members - anytime a black guy sings Sonny Bono songs and white guys are Pips, the presentation lacks some authenticity. Overall the music impersonations were poor - the women match the original artists sound quality, but can anyone really sound like Elvis, Dean Martin or Wayne Newton? But the dancing was very good. I'm not sure it's worth $64 dollars. With the discount tickets we were advised to get there an hour early to get in line. We were about the halfway point of the line, but after we were seated there was only one occupied row behind us - not sure what happened to others in line, but there was no advantage to get there early. My wife went to the spa one afternoon and really enjoyed the $200 massage - it's good to know my hard earned money is appreciated. We didn't gamble much, but it was interesting to see how people waste their day at a digital slot machine. You don't even have to pull a lever anymore, just push the button. The volcano display at the Mirage and the fountains at Bellagio are worth watching if you are walking by, but not worth a special trip. We traveled by foot to places on the Strip. Cabs are pricey and waits are long, the metro bus rarely travels by and the monorail train station is a 20 minute walk from Caesars.

Staff were friendly and the buffet was wonderful (good, fresh food). We bought the 24 hour buffet pass and made good use of it, though the other buffets did not live up to the standard set by Caesars. Our only let-down was that the concierge service steered us wrong, not once, but twice. The first time we were told to catch the gold bus heading south on the strip at the Bellagio stop (it was a long walk there and it was closed for construction). We actually could have caught the bus out front near the Colisseum! The second time we were told we could catch the shuttle to the Rio in the Paris driveway.

The last time we were here was 2 years ago. This is our 4th visit and the most disappointing. The place has changed considerably. It is obvious there are cutbacks and they are affecting the hotel. When we checked in, we were told they were going to \"upgrade\" our room. We thought how nice that was. Well, \"upgrade\" was not the case. We went up to the room in the Palace Tower and entered the \"Junior Suite\" they supposedly \"upgraded\" us to. The closet door was OFF the hinges! It was a like a bad motel! I couldn't believe a hotel like this would check people in a room when the closet door was off the hinges. We called down to the desk to ask for a different room. I finally spoke to someone after sitting on hold for 10 minutes. I explained the problem and that we did not need the \"upgrade\" to the junior suite and really liked the standard rooms in the Palace Tower. The woman on the phone said there were no rooms left. Ahhh, the real reason for us being put in a junior suite. BTW, the room is exactly the same, the junior suite has two small bathrooms instead of one large bathroom in the regular Palace Tower rooms. We prefer the one large bathroom actually. They moved us to another \"junior suite\" where the room was just run down. The bed is not comfortable, the pillows are awful. The room was not clean, a lot of dust! Stains on the bedskirt. There is a hole in the blanket on the bed. And, there is some kind of rust on the door frame of the bathroom that is eating away at the bottom of it about 3 inches up. Very noticeable. My husband complained at the front desk and was completely blown off. We checked in on Wednesday and still today (Friday) there is dirty glassware on the floor of the hall in the corner that has been sitting there! I wonder how long it has been there? I called for room service yesterday, 3 times, and never got an answer! There is no longer a turn down service, as there was 2 years ago. Basically, I used to love this hotel. It has changed!

We talked for several minutes about his life growing up in Vegas and my life growing up in the Midwest. Thankfully he liked me so he upgraded us to an amazing suite in the Palace tower...2 bathrooms, huge jacuzzi tub, grea view of the pools, amazing bed, etc. It was a $500 upgrade for free! I was so thankful I THEN tipped him $20 which he was very grateful for. The rooms were just amazing, no two ways about it. The minibar wasn't too expensive, the movies were pretty cheap to rent, and I found the noise from the hall and other rooms to be at a minimum. I felt like a Queen!!!! We ate at Beijing Noodle and it was to die for! We also ate at the Palm restaurant in the Forum Shops and it was so decadent...sinful.

My friends and I made reservations for a top notch room but were given a ghetto room in the centurion towers because they had \"overbooked\" the hotel and were even sending people to planet hollywood. By the time we got to our room, the room was no better than a motel. Basically, the point I am getting to is that Caesar's tries to accommodate everyone (based on their reputation) but in the end, it has become a run down hotel. The absolute worst is their customer service. While cashing out casino chips, the teller literally gave me cut-eye for 1 minute, for no reason whatsoever, until I asked her what her problem was. She huffed, demanded I.D. and I had to eventually tell her supervisor that she could have just asked me for that in the first place! When I had stayed at ARIA earlier, I thought casino employees were going to impregnate me with their smiles alone! This was the worst hotel ever, I regret gambling and spending so much money in their casino...never again, will I contribute to Caesar's again.

The smell was only in the corridor the first night but on the second it had penetrated the rooms and was really vile. I was pleased to leave the room. The corridor itself did nothing to invite you in. Narrow, dingy, low ceiling - it looked more like the servants quarters.

Caesar's has seemingly forgotten this second part. It all appears very nice and accommodating, but upon closer inspection, it reveals itself as merely a facade. Upon check-in, the desk clerk asks how your trip was and a few other pleasantries, which seems nice, until you hear the other desk clerks ask the same exact questions as if they're reading from a script. The casino floor is well lit, clean and inviting, but good luck finding your way around and ignoring the awful pop music blaring 24 hours/day. The restaurants all look delicious, but good luck researching them beforehand. There's a surcharge for wifi, menus weren't available in the room, and the interactive kiosks located throughout the casino floor provide little information beyond location and logo. Everything is designed to force you onto the casino floor. (FYI, if you choose to stay here, Cyprus Street (may be inexact name) is the food court for quick and cheaper meals.) Beyond that, my wife had a bad experience with a waitress at the pool area and I had a bad experience with one of the counter guys at the sportsbook. The first day there, we were exhausted from traveling and was looking for a quick meal. Unable to do any online research as to the layout of the hotel, I just tried to wander around looking for a place with take-out. I found \"munchbar\". Forty minutes after ordering, my $40 worth of burgers and fries were ready and when I arrived back in my room, I discovered that they had screwed up and put cheese on my lactose intolerant wife's burger. So yeah, that was awesome. In sum, Caesars looks very nice, but lacks personal touches that could have made our stay really enjoyable. Its difficult and frustrating to do anything other than gamble - but here's the hook to you Casino owners and investors: if I'm enjoying myself otherwise, I'm going to be more willing to gamble.

Have nothing bad to say about the hotel. Arrived and didnt have to wait long to check in, receptionist realised from my passport that my bday was in 3 days time and gave us an amazing room in the Augustus Tower. We were on the 33rd floor and our window over looked the Bellagio Fountains and of an evening with the lights and the fountains - the view is spectacular. Room was huge, massive bath and shower. Twin sinks and seperate toilet. Fully stocked mini bar - didnt use as its very expensive but thats to be expected. Casino - I didnt play the tables here but I did play the slots and I cant complain. One day I put $24 in a machine and won $558 and the next I put $10 in and won $111....all in all I was happy! Pool - Absolutely amazing!!! water is cold but it was so hot we didnt mind. The whirlpool is a huge jacuzzi and very warm water - lovely!! They have club days at another pool which I think you have to pay to enter - we didnt go in but you dont have to as you can hear the music at the other pools anyway! Food - Only place I ate in here was the noodle place with the massive fish tank at the entrance - food was delicious - would recommend the clay chicken!! The bar near reception is really nice - just opposite the bell desk. Really nice staff, nice and relaxed atmosphere. Pure nightclub is really good and if your a guest you can always get in but you do have to pay - queues are MASSIVE. Music and service inside is really good though and worth a visit. Shops - The shops are out of this world - cheesecake factory is a MUST!!! Best and biggest cheesecakes ever. Only complaint I have is that in the early hours of my last day I got into the fountain which is in reception for a quick photograph and got really told off by a large man who I can only assume is a manager.....whilst I will admit to be slightly drunk and yes maybe they dont want people in their fountain - he could have politely asked me to get out. Instead he told me to leave and even when I explained I was a guest he still told me to go to my room, get my things and leave! I didnt. I personally just felt that this was slightly over the top, I am sure I am not the first and I am sure I wont be the last person to get in the fountain. On top of this there are no signs asking people not to get in it and nor are there any barriers to prevent it.

One really nice bonus was when my hubby picked our chairs by the pool we were in front of one of those lovely cabanas and very shortly later the individuals who had that cabana showed up - Rod Stewart and his family - he was so incredible - let me get a picture taken with him as well as numerous other people. He was very friendly with everyone. Since I am a fan it was a pretty special moment for me. Overall Ceasars is our choice to stay when we are in Vegas - they treat us well. One tip I would give is get a Total Rewards card - I think their comps are by far the best. The location is fantastic and even though it is a huge place eventually you get your bearings.

Make sure your room is not in the Roman Tower which is yet to be renovated. One of the deluxe rooms in the Palace Tower will be clean, well appointed, pretty sound proof with a large bathroom and simply the most comfortable beds and pillows. (an opinion shared by another couple on the trip with us, their room had equally comfy bed and pillow they say) In the mornings, do NOT go to the cafes in the casino for your overly expensive coffee and tasteless muffins, or spend 10 dollars for a yogurt parfait at one of the other coffee express places. Instead, sit down for breakfast at Payard's which is one of the restaurants near the conference center lobby. It will not be cheaper, but it will be better! Excellent coffee, delicious omelets for the same price as the coffee in a styrofoam cup and a muffin made out of mix #5. Plan on 20 dollars EACH for breakfast for sit down 15 dollars for a coffee and a muffin...you do the math. Make sure you take advantage of the pools at Caesar's. The main pool is enormous, you can get up early and secure your chairs for free or shell out a lot of bucks to rent a daybed that is yours and yours alone. Excellent poolside bar service and the lunch menu is affordable and GOOD, good value from the pool lunch menu for sure. If you are over 21, take advantage of the Venus pool club. There is often an expensive \"cover charge\" for using this private pool area, it accepts only 150 or so guests and allows topless sunbathing. It is much less frenetic than the main pool. IF you get there when they open, they often waive the cover and you can secure your pool side chairs for free, or rent a day bed for several hundred dollars or for nearly a THOUSAND dollars, rent a cabana (you don't need to, really!) Bar service is excellent although drinks as always are pricey. (by the way, the best cocktail they make is the MaiTai, but you can have anything you want). Bar and service staff are friendly, polite and go out of their way to help you out. Music by the pool is current and good, although occasionally loudish. Pool is clean and warm in the Venus area and security does an excellent job of ensuring that no drunken louts ruin your experience. People watching at Venus pool is entertainment in itself. We found gambling fun next door at the Bellagio to be a bit of a better experience than at Caesar's. Drink service was MUCH more prompt and friendly and the variety of tables and slots was more extensive, although we have to admit that the guys working the craps tables at Caesar's were friendly, knowledgeable and fun. Night club experience at Caesar's was hit and miss. Shadow bar is a waste of time after about an hour when the novelty of a girl dancing behind a screen has really worn off, with extremely poor drink service. Cleopatra's barge is busy high energy and dark with expensive drinks (all drinks are in Vegas) but pretty good dancing. PURE is the much advertised night club, but full of teeny bopper types, a VERY young crowd. (Isn't the drinking age 21?) If you are a shopper, the forum shops are heaven! We loved walking through and ladies, for a magnificent shopping experience with a very personal touch, go to Michael Kors Shoe Store. Without a doubt the best service we have ever had shopping. In the words of the manager \"we know you can spend your money anywhere and we really want you to spend it here so it is up to us to look after you\". Nirvana.

I was most disappointed with the pool areas, as one is not meant to reserve sunloungers, but the thing that happened was that people did not clear up their towels when they left so it looked as if the seat was still taken. The earea around the pool is not big enough and what there is was being taken over by their special beds, you had to pay extra for. They have these cabanas, a bit like a gazebo with 3 sides covered, you get a few drinks a few bags of crisps, a ceiling fan, this will set you back a neat $350.00!! The staff are unhelpful and there is a lot of mess around the pool, half empty drinks, spilled drinks food that has been left. I know it is due to people not clearing up after themselves but there is no staff to this either. Lots of gambling if this is what you are there for even in one of the pools.

I dropped some crisps on the carpet on the first night there and they were still sat mashed into the carpet along with other bits of dirt and fluff on our last day! Which means our room was not vacuumed for our entire 7 night stay- not something you would expect of a 'luxury' hotel. My partner users a wheelchair and found it quite difficult to move around the hotl hotel due to it being entirely carpeted (other than forum shops area), also none of the disabled lifts worked throughout the hotel so we were forced to go long the long way round, which really is long as the hotel is huge. We booked a day bed at the pool at a cost of $200 and were promised a host would visit us every 10 mins to check if we needed anything/bring drinks. We saw him twice in 5 hours and were annoyed to find that a $30 gratuity charge was added to the bill. We ate in Neros on our first evening and found the service quite poor, our waiter spent whole time fussying around a table of business as he obviously saw a potential big tip. Found this quite annoying as meal wasn't cheap- \u00a3100 for 2 with only 1 glass of wine on bill! On a positive note, the hotel has excellent amenities, many restaurants of ranging price brackets and also has a cheaper food court for when money is getting low!.

We couldn't believe that we could book a trip to Vegas at such a nice hotel for $500 a person INCLUDING airfare. We also thought maybe we wouldn't have a great room or great service since we weren't big spenders, but we couldn't have been more wrong. We did purchase a shuttle service from the airport which made getting to the hotel efficient and easy. Once there, check-in only took about 20 minutes and we walked into our beautiful and classy hotel room. Great beds, very spacious, great views, awesome bathroom with separate toilet, huge vanity and shower - unfortunately it didn't get great pressure but that was honestly the least of our worries. Bed was super comfortable and the blinds were remote operated and there was a thermostat in the room, along with a mini bar and flat screen television. I called the concierge for help picking out restaurants and they were so helpful, not only directing us to restaurants in their own hotel. I'm not a gambler but I did have fun in the casino and liked Caesar's better than the others we went to. There is a pu$$y cat doll's area that is more youth and inexperienced gambler friendly if you want to sit down at a table and play blackjack or poker or other games. The overall hotel experience was wonderful and Vegas was a great time. We ate at great restaurants (Nobu, Prime, caught a few buffets, Carnegie Deli..) and went to see Cirque de Soleil Love (the Beatles Cirque show) and was blown away. It was my third Cirque show (saw Mystere twice - Toronto and Vegas) and I'm not a crazy Beatles fanatic (boyfriend is - also loved the show). I do have to say the acrobatics were more impressive in Mystere, but that is not really the sole focus of this particular show. We also checked out the little \"zoo\" at the Mirage and it was worth the money, lions, tigers, dolphins, etc. Just a fun little spot.

I have read reviews prior to all trips we take. I find it helpful. My wife and I traveled to Vegas to get away and enjoy our anniversary and to recharge our batteries. We both enjoy Vegas and Ceasars Palace. It is our third or fourth time staying there. Checkin: The first thing we noticed was the crowd at check in. There is nothing worse than waiting in line after flying half the day and all you want to do is relax. After waiting 30 minutes to get to the front of the line we were pleasantly greeted. Our reservation was confirmed. We booked using reward points for a generic Roman tower room. We explained it was our anniversary trip and told her that we enjoyed the pool and stayed in the Palace Tower,which is very accessible to the pool, our last trip 2 years ago. She congratulated us on our anniversary and told us she was getting us a room in the Palace Tower. The other good news, our room was ready. A great start to our vacation. Housekeeping: During our stay we had very good housekeeping service. We left a note and a tip for the housekeeper each day. We always had enough towels and supplies. Extra towels are a must during the summer, going from the pool to the shower to lunch, to the pool to the shower to dinner. Pool: The pool was very crowded. It was not a problem for us. We were up early each day anyway, going west 2 time zones. We moved a couple of different times the first two days until we found the pool and the music we liked best and chose that area the rest of the trip. The service at the pool was good considering all the people. The prices are extremely high. You could break the bank without even gambling if you want food and drinks all day. Gaming: We are not huge gamblers. We do like to play a little. The table minimums are high. We went acros the street to play the lower minimums. It just suits our budget a little better. We were there during the World Cup semis and the sports book was a great place to see it. Restaurants: We did the \"Buffet of Buffets\" one day. The pros are the choices and the price. The cons are the wait and the dessert choices. We waited 15-45 minutes to get in to each restaurant. We ate at Raos one night and really enjoyed the whole experience. The waiter was very good and the food was very good. The price was high but we expected that as well. Overall: A nice vacation. When we are on vacation, we are not in any hurry.

They took our bags out the car and gave us tickets to call when we received our rooms. Because we arrived at the hotel before the 3pm check-in, our hotel room was not ready. Also, during the check-in process they didn't have a clear setup of where the line started and stopped. Apparently, you just stand in front of the front desk person you want to see.

So that was nice. I was assigned a executive suite in the Forum Tower. Apparently,these rooms are newly renovated. They were very plush. The suite came with a L shaped lounger sofa, round table with chairs, flat screens in the living room and bedrooms. There was a full size walk in closet. The bathroom was pretty large. It had a plasma tv in the bathroom mirror, a jacuzzi tub, separate marble shower with jets against the wall and 2 dispensers on top the shower (very nice). The few was of the strip. I did eat at Munch bar(snack./sandwich shop) and Messa(southwestern cuisine). The food at the Munch bar was decent although high price, which is normal for a hotel. For an example, it was a 14.00 burger. Messa was more expensive. I guess they are known for the steaks, tomales, and pork. Everything is a la cart. Meals easily go up to 100.00 for one person. We went down to the pool on Thursday at 10am. Absolutely all the FREE chairs were gone. I guess people get down early and just put there towels on the chairs to reserve them.The only things left were the beds you have to pay for. Those range from 150-300 dollars. This is for the Ceasars Pool. Right next to the Ceasar's pool is the exclusive pool that's 21 and up only and it allows you to go topless. I was originally offended by the concept. But, after walking around the regular pool several times with no luck finding a chair, I was able to sweet talked my way into the exclusive pool for free. I think normally they charge 30.00 to get in. They have a dj in that pool area and it's less crowded and very relaxing. Also there were plenty of chairs in that location. On friday night I went to PURE, which is the nightclub in the hotel. They give you free passes at the hotel concierge's desk to get in free. They play alot of dance and techno music. The place is 2 levels with an outside roof bar/dance floor. Lots of people go there and they get bottle service at the tables that ranges from 500-2000 dollars. If you don't have a table, then you are standing the entire night.I also signed up for the total rewards program. You can add your meals, casino games, and stores from Ceasar's Palace. When you sign up, they give you $5.00 of free money. I took the $5.00 to a penny slot machine and it won me $81.00 (not bad). Checkout was flawless since I left around 900am. I noticed that the hotel check in process for the weekend(fri/sat) is extremely busy. I check-in on a Wednesday so it wasn't that bad. I found a good breakfast place across the street that was relatively in expensive. It's directly across the street from the Bellagio. You can eat breakfast on the patio in the morning. They have great mimosas. It's called Mon Ami Gabi.", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whippany, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Center Strip Hotel and close to everything!!!\u201d", "Author": "hugedevilsfan", "ReviewID": "UR70826354", "Content": "We were greeted at the Valet in the front by a person that was especially nice and had our luggage taken right away.

To top it off, after a lot of walking up and down the strip after dinner, we come back for a swim and learn they close the pool at 8 pm!

Then they want you to fill out a survey about your trip and ask you for contact info. Filled out the survey for the December and June trips and have I heard from them about the poor service on either trip.

This is the 2nd time we have stayed at this particular hotel/casino. We travel to Vegas about three times a year, usually for leisure and have stayed at various hotels on the strip. We had booked a standard room, but when my husband checked in, he upgraded us to a suite. We have learned that if you ask for an upgrade at check-in, you can get a good deal. Sometimes, we have got our upgrades for free. The suite had two bedrooms with a living room in between. Each bedroom had a flat screen telelvision and each of the three bathrooms had a flat screen television. One bathroom was located in the living room area. There was also a large bar with refrigerator in the living room. The suite was fabulous! It was located on the penthouse floor, which was a very quiet, You had to have a key to this floor for the elevator to access it. Housekeeping came into the room several times a day to tidy up and bring you anything you might need. There is a variety of restaurants in Caesar's with different types of food and a variety of value. Located at the entrance of The Forum Shops is a food court that serves fast food. Our favorite place to eat at Caesar's is at the sushi bar in the Japanese restaurant. Great sushi and great service! The Forum Shops is a great place to shop. There are standard shops (Gap, Lucky Jeans, etc.) and also a variety of higher end shops. There is also FAO Schwartz Toy Department store in the mall if you are looking for gifts for your children. Caesars has a great nightlife. We had passes to Pure Nightclub, which was having a special guest (the White House Crashers) the night we went. The place was packed! Even though the place is a \"meat market,\" it was fun to go, since we had always heard so many things about it. We also attended the Bette Midler concert at Caesar's Palace, which was fabulous! She is amazing! Caesar's Palace is located centrally on the Vegas strip. It is a very popular hotel, and therefore, it is difficult to get a great deal here. It is not the best value on the strip.

This is the 3rd time I've booked with Caesers Palace and I told myself that I wasn't going to cancel this time. We arrived around 4pm. Check in was fast. The next day the line was very long a few times. We booked a smoking room but when we got to the room it was non-smoking. Called the front desk and they changed our room right away. You woiuldn't even know that it was a smoking room. Very clean. Since I booked the Augustus Tower they upgraded my friends at no xtra charge. Only down fall no coffee pot. The Augustus Cafe is right off the elevator. I had a beautiful view of the Belliago Fountains. The pools are absolutely beautiful. Just a short distance from the room. If you are in the Augustus Tower you don't have to go through the casino to go to the pool. The strip is also right outside the elevator. Service in the casino was ok. I only had to wait a short time. The food was good and a decent variety. Cheap Trick is a must see. Best concert I've ever seen. They are at Paris. I would definetly stay at Caesars Palace again.

Room also has all mod cons that are free.. Iron, safe, hairdryer etc etc Pool - there are free sundbeds and ones you have to pay for which is fair enough the free ones are fine they are comfy and close to the water so when your to hot you can just jump in the pool and cool down, the towels you can grab any part of the day. food wise there are two shops (newsagent sort of style) where you can get drinks and snacks but also there is a hot food place called snackius maximus which is not badly priced. shops - there are a whole complex called the forum shops that has no end of choice as well as restaurants. Casino - you will be asked for ID so have it with you i had my UK driving licence on me and that was fine for the whole of vegas not just here. The table prices vary the cheap slots go from 1cent up to $5 a pull, and the blackjacket tables best i found was $5 a hand poker and roulette was the same $5 for both. Drinking - The best thing is getting drinks... play slow and steady on the machines no rush until one of the girls comes and asks if you can get a drink have what ever you want... beer, spirts or soda. we tipped well the first time and then every time they come back and ask you again just tip them $1 and they will look after you all night and if you want to leave the casino and have a drink dont worry about finishing it take it out onto the strip drink it walking down the road and take it into another casino they dont say a word.

Elevators to the Augustus Tower are located just to the left of the concierge/check-in area. And next to the Augustus Cafe (the only food you can get at Caesars apparently after 11PM). Very quiet area, yet just a hop, skip and a jump from the casino. This is truly the tower to book at if you don't want to walk through slot machines to get to your room, and want the added convenience of being closer to the Strip. There is a separate side entrance off the street if you want to take that route. The pool area (a must see) located conveniently down the hall from the tower elevators. Considering the age of the hotel, we decided to book these newer rooms. Very good strategy. The Palace Towers are also newer but we did not have a chance to check them out. The only downside to Caesar's is that the casino ceiling is lower than most (if you consider it is a 50 year old hotel) and that makes the ventilation a bit of a problem. Lots of smoke indeed. There are several beautiful pools located in the back of the hotel. We were unable to find chairs as we showed up around 1. Renting a regular lounge chair costs about $30 and there were none to be found at this time. The pool was extremely crowded. The more plush chairs were about $300 and the cabanas around $450. Both the cabanas and plush chairs were all empty with signs saying that you needed to pay to use them. We ended up laying on the ground on our towels.....(downside).

Our accommodation was booked as a five day stay with three days complimentary of Caesars Palace due to our Rewards Card membership. After twenty minute wait within the streamline of customers patiently waiting for their check-in, we were comforted with a friendly staff member. Due to our 31st anniversary we inquired about an upgrade from our complimentary room. She introduced us to an upgrade room of over 2000 sq ft room offering a dining room, three bathrooms, a guest\u2019s entertainment bar, living room and a grand master bedroom. First she offered the room for $100 per night, but her duty manager refused such an offer. She came back to us sheepish, quickly apologising letting us know that her boss wouldn\u2019t allow such a price. We asked if he would accept $150 per night in which he rudely stated he could get a much better price per night. With that, embarrassed by the situation the girl attending to us, asked if we would accept $200 per night. We hummed and hawed over this price, as it was just too much, as I already knew that that our last night, Thursday night, would end up costing us the $170 plus $200 and an additional tax charge. Our Thursday night would cost $500 alone. With the overall costs I said, \u201cNo \u2013 that is just too much for us.\u201d So I asked just for our complimentary room instead. As soon as I said that, our complimentary room turned into a nightmare of a room. The room Caesars Palace offered was on the third floor with only double beds, where we had reserved a King size bed. Suddenly I felt I was been taken for a ride and must of given the most discussed facial expression. She once again offered us the 2000 sq ft room on the 14 floor for $200 per night. My wife voiced her opinion and asked me to go for the upgrade, as it is our 31st anniversary. I decided to please my wives wishes, but still felt we were taken for a quick ride. From past experiences with complimentary rooms, they usually have offered us a deluxe upgrade at no charge. We were here to enjoy ourselves, so we left it at that, even though I knew our overall costs would be $1800 for just the room for five days. What really caught me off guard were the taxes with each night costing a whopping $100. Our room was enormous and apparently the original cost per night was $3600 per night. Mind you, we really didn\u2019t have any use for three bathrooms or a large dining room table. Originally we were going to use the spa, fitness centre and go to three different shows, but after our upgraded costs of our room, we could not afford any of these luxuries. The next morning we did indulge in the featured Buffet of Buffets at a cost of $34.99 per person for reward card members and $39.99 for non-members. Knowingly we paced ourselves in order to go to all three buffets with Harrah\u2019s Properties. Lago Buffet at Caesars Palace was our breakfast choice and was pleasantly surprised by great friendly service and inviting food for any foodies. You had a choice of freshly-made omelettes, baked ham, turkey or pork bacon, wide range of sausages, assorted seafood & potatoes and a fine selection of pastries. Our luncheon choice was going to be at the Paris hotel, but after seeing the overwhelming line-up we jetted over to Planet Hollywood and were glad we did. The Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood featured Mexican, American, Italian and Middle Eastern food items. I stuck with the American food choices while my wife found fresh hot asparagus in the Italian section. Of course we shared the tasty asparagus while enjoying the beef and chicken dishes. We were seated in front of the Middle Eastern section and if only had room, I would have indulged in the pork kabobs cooking on the bbq. But I did leave room for the tantalizing desserts, like chocolate \u00e9clairs. After a long walk throughout the Vegas Strip we headed to our last buffet of the day, back to the Lago Buffet at Caesars Palace. Our choice of prime rib, crab and peel and eat shrimp, we barely made a dent. Needless to say we were FULL! Next morning we headed to the pool and found we were lucky to be poolside just before 9:00 am, as it quickly filled up. We decided to indulge into one of the bar drinks at a gasping price of $20 per drink, not including tip; needless to say, we had very few drinks at the pool. We quickly learned that any charges to our room would be topped off by a heavy tax. Mind you, poolside was complete luxury and worth the time taking in the sun rays. Throughout our days at Caesars Palace we took in the pool daily. Of course we took our turn in the casinos and knowingly spent our budget, but with a couple of noticeable wins. Smartly we re-invested our winnings back into the cost of our room. On Wednesday, we headed over to our reserved dining experience at the famous Eiffel Tower Restaurant at the Paris Hotel. Within minutes we were seated at our window seat over-looking the Bellagio with its fountain display featuring a beautiful view. Our selection of entrees envisioned a freshly cooked beef wellington with potato gratinee and hot asparagus. Unfortunately our entrees were cold with my beef wellington undercooked. I summoned our waiter, his eye brows raised as he looked at the raw beef within the pastry. He quickly took it away, with me thinking that I would receive a new freshly baked beef wellington. Astonished by the quick comeback of my dish, I noticed it was placed under a salamander to finish cooking. Shaking my head, I decided it was best not to say anymore, with them having no idea they were dealing with a retired Executive Chef of over twenty-five years of culinary experience. The view was great and the chocolate souffl\u00e9 was wonderful. The rest of our stay at Caesars Palace was uneventful with good service from the casino to our room maid. In conclusion I would recommend Caesars Palace but do not suggest any upgrade, leaving them with the choice of upgrading for you at no additional charge. The food at Caesars Palace is acceptable with friendly service. Be aware that anything that you want to do cost extra, including the internet service of $14.95 per day, fitness centre at $25 per day and the spa service starting at $45 per person. It is to your advantage to become a Rewards Card member to entitle you to frequent offers either to your door or e-mail address. Vegas Reviews understands that a mega corporation like Harrah\u2019s Properties really isn\u2019t too concerned with customer\u2019s reviews, as they rely on high-rollers and established guests that spend an average of $25,000 - $100,000 per stay. Spending $4000 is small potatoes to such a large corporation. I will keep you updated if Caesars Palace leaves a comment...

There were at least 50 people ahead of us on line waiting to check in. Check in time is 1 pm, we got on line at 12:17 and got to the front at 1:17. Our room was not ready yet, so we couldn\u2019t get the key. We decided to grab lunch while we waited (at Caesar\u2019s) and they wouldn\u2019t let us in with our bags. We were told to check them. We had to wait on line to do that , too\u2026and then back to lunch, where we had to wait on line to get in, wait to place our order and then wait to get served (one of our meals were wrong, too). When we were through with lunch, we had to wait on the \u201cexpress\u201d line again to get our keys and the room still wasn\u2019t ready. After much begging, the desk clerk agreed to give us the key as long as we promised not to go to our room for one hour. An hour later, we went to our room and called for our luggage and \u2013 not surprisingly \u2013 had to wait an extraordinary amount of time for it to arrive. We made our way down to the pool and no one knew about the pool chairs we had called to reserve a week earlier. The life guard/pool maid at the Jupiter pool was extremely rude and explained that the chairs had to be paid for before we sat in them. Also, there was biohazard danger in the Jupiter pool, so no one was allowed to go in it. Other annoying things: 1. Buffet lines ridiculously long 2. No barber service on Sunday or Monday 3. Confusing casino layout 4. Unnecessarily loud and noisy 5. All spa services ridiculously overpriced This is just a taste of what we experienced and what you can expect if you stay at this hotel. When we go on vacation, we want everything to be as easy as possible. Everything that you want to do at Caesar\u2019s either requires you to wait on line or pay extra money\u2026 and everything is a hassle. The staff is inefficient and rude.

I'll add mine to the long list of reviews. In general I liked my stay at Caesars and given the fact that I had business to attend in that same hotel, it was a good stay. Some highlights and things to improve: Positive: - Fast check-in: the line was not long and check-in was very efficient. In my room in about 5-10 minutes (can't remember, had a big jetlag during check-in) - Large room (Palace Tower De Luxe): I stayed for 8 nights, so some space is always welcome. - Enormous pool area. Looking at other hotels, pool/room ratio is great at Caesar's. - Good choice of food in and around the hotel, although pricey. Caesar's is smack in the middle of the Strip, so a good place to start your adventures in Sin City. - Parcel center/Business desk: good services to help you get your business done. Very friendly and helpful. Don't look at the costs of their services though ;-) - Hotel navigation: You will need to learn your way around the hotel, but you will learn this soon enough. Comparing with some other Vegas hotels, it is pretty simple. Negative: - Room location: I reckon I didn't have one of the best rooms in the Palace Tower ( 6th floor, not great views). Given the large amounts of nights, I would have expected something more. - Fitness: apparently common in Las Vegas: visiting the fitness area would set you back USD 25 . Opening hours very limited (6am - 8pm). If you are there on business, these times are not suitable for a work-out. And 25 USD _per_ day is just plain outrageous. I just went outside in the early morning for some running. - Internet: although the room description stated that Internet was included in my type of room, connecting my laptop would incur a 15 USD per day charge. Maybe that would be comped during check-out, but I didn't try. I can live without Internet, but maybe they could clarify their policy - Noise: Through the connecting doors a lot of \"neighbor noise\" was heard. I had a party group next to me a couple of days, they crammed with up to 6 people in a room at 5am. I had to call security one night. That was handled nicely and discreetly. But you know groups: after an hour, the volume went up again. The hotel wasn't full by any chance, so I would expect that the people would be spread during check-in. - Pool: Unlike other hotels, everyone can visit the pool, no guest check is executed. This leads to lots of locals spending their day off at Caesars, so no empty chairs anymore at 9:05am, unless you pay $$$ for the daybeds and cabana's. These prices are flexible and I heard prices up to 350 USD for half a day... - Pool service: After ordering a drink and some bites to eat (took me 30 minutes to get the attendants attention), I waited for an hour: no drink, no bite. I had to retrieve the credit card myself at the bar. No apologies. Still awaiting the credit card invoice whether the order was billed or not. Overall: a good hotel and after seeing some other hotels I was glad I booked Caesar's, but given their steep price, they should increase their service on some major points.", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "jaelsawa", "Title": "\u201cWedding in Venus Garden\u201d", "Author": "jaelsawa", "ReviewID": "UR65024078", "Content": "We were married on May 15th, 2010 in the Venus Garden at Caesar's Palace. What an incredible experience! Everything was wonderful and beyond expectations. Our package included an hour's worth of limo use, so we opted to be picked up at the airport. We had my son and his girlfriend with us, who had never been to Vegas before. She was amazed as we drove the strip and were delivered by limo to our hotel. Our trip consisted of six nights, the first two were comped with my Total Rewards card, the second two were included in the wedding package and the third set of two were comped on my fiance's TR card. Six nights of luxury on the 24th floor of the Palace Tower. The room was very nice with marble floors and granite counter tops in the bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and we did not hear any noise coming from neighbors. The view was to the north and at night we could watch the volcano show at the mirage from our window. The ceremony was great. I had read posts that warned that the noise from the pools would be a problem, with the garden wedding being right next door. That was not a problem as our wedding planner, Melissa, said they turn the music down during the ceremonies. Everything was top notch: the music, the photos, the video, the flowers, the location. We were very happy and received many compliments on how perfect it all was. Our reception was held in the Atrium at the Augustus Cafe. The food was absolutely incredible. I had the chicken with the best garlic mashed potatoes I have ever tasted. I was also told by those who had the salmon that it was the best they had ever had. We opted for the chocolate cake with cream cheese frosting and it was very delicious. We were very happy with our experience and would recommend using Caesar's for your wedding.

We waited for an hour for a bus to arrive to take us to the hotel, were ignored and to top it all off, a sleezy salesman boarded the bus with us to try and sell us show tickets and get us hooked into a timehare deal. Annoyed to say the least. Back to Caesars. Unlike a nice bottle of wine, not all things get better with time. Caesars is nice in some areas, then just rundown in others. We had 5 rooms for our party, had spent over 10,000 dollars on this trip alone for the wedding, and REFUSED to allow the hotel to hold 200 dollars on each of our credit cards. Initially when I was greeted, I heard the front desk person mention what tower we were in..... however, after we argued about the card being held, when we finally got our room keys we were placed in the ROMAN TOWER. The Roman Tower is apparently where they send people they do not like or care about because its crappy as any hour rate motel you will find off the strip. Its dingy, run down and the power went out in the bathroom while my wife was hurrying to get ready for a wedding. The call to the front desk to get some help was as pleasant as stepping on glass shards. The electrical outlets in the room didnt work, awesome for charging cell phones and laptops..... and to top it all off, the view included a rooftop and Donny Osmonds face.

We found check-in to be easy, after reading reviews on here I was expecting to have a long wait but there was only three people waiting in front of us and five people already being dealt with, so that went smoothly enough. The check-in staff where polite and helpful, marking on a map how to get through the casino and to the elevators in the Palace Tower. We arrived at our room on the sixteenth floor with no problem. The view from the room was toward the Wynn hotel, not brilliant but not too bad either. I knew that the items in the fridge were weight sensored so we knew that if we had anything out of it that it was going to be expensive but we were warned that even if we moved anything it would be charged to us. My husband was so thristy so decided to have a SMALL orange soda and it was $4, so be warned. The room was lovely, very luxurious with two queen size beds and a large bathroom. There was lots of fluffy towels and everything was spotlessly clean. The food in the hotel was very expensive so we tended to eat off property and considering the queues in none hotel restaurants I think everyone was doing the same. The pool area is gorgeous, comfy sun loungers and lots of them but don't forget there are lots of people staying here so you did need to get your lounger very early on in the day unless you wanted to pay $50 for the more luxurious ones. There was loud music playing round the pool area every day, my hubby and I usually class lounging by the pool as a time of peace and relaxation but that was definately not going to happen so decided to have a few drinks to relax us. Waitresses in bikinis are serving drinks by the pool, I had a Pina Colada and my hubby had a soda and the check came to $26 plus tip. We didn't get drunk that day. The casino is a place you could easily spend full days in and thats just trying to find your way out, no windows, no clocks and no exit signs but if you asked staff for directions they were only too happy to help. The shops had some lovely wares, most of them designer names but it was nice to window shop in an incredible environment.

I had been there several times before. Caesars Palace was nice to stay in, but check in lines were horrible. They did not have the room we had reserved, so they upgraded us... however the upgrade room only had one bed, not two as needed.. so the first night we had to use a roll-away-bed (not the most comfortable thing..) Then they were supposed to switch our room the next day - during which we were without a room for 7 hours (which is not good when your wife is wanting to freshen up before going to a show). Then - no-one had told the bell desk to move our luggage as they were supposed to do, so I had to do that too (or wait another 1/2 hour before they could get to it.)But at least the new room was very nice, 25th floor overlooking the pool. If your on a budget - the Buffet is the best deal - get the 24 hour pass for $34.95 (note - this price includes the $5 discount if you have a free players card... GET ONE free to save $5 per person). The 24 hour buffet deal is good at any of the Caesars properties including Planet Hollywood, flamingo, Harrahs, etc... NOTE - The buffet at Caeasar Palace is the WORST!!! Poor selection of food, cold food, dried out food, bitter coffee, etc. The Flamingo right across the street is VERY GOOD. Hard to believe that one company owns both hotels and such a drastic difference i the quality of the buffets. at least 300% better at Flamingo! As for the shows... Cirque de solei Mystere has been my favorite followed by La Rev (shown at the Wynn) or Phantom of the Opera (at the Venitian), Last place goes to Cirque's KA. KA was good, but not nearly as good as Mystere. Be prepared to pay $$$ for just about anything... couple good FREE things to see are Bellagio gardens, Bellagio fountains (at night), Lion habitat at Venitian, Sculptures throughout Caesars. Rent a car and drive to Red Rock Canyon or Valley of Fire State Park. Both are welcome distractions from the crowds and well worth seeing! Red Rock was free.. Valley of Fire was $10 for the carload. Both are about a 45 minute drive from the strip. Depending on how much you want to hike while there - you can see Red Rock in 1 hour or a full day. Valley of fire - 2 hours to a full day. Also VERY FUN is Pole Position Raceway... indoor go-carts about 2 miles off the strip.. Pricey at $25 per 8 minute race, but you usually can find a coupon for \"Buy 2 races - get 3rd free\" on the internet... These carts are FAST!

I am a frequent visitor to Las Vegas, but this was my first time at Caesar's and I would rate it as one of the better hotel stays. To get the negative out of the way first, the most glaring issue (and most expected) was a check-in line that took 45 minutes. This was at 4:00pm when attendee's from 4 separate conference were checking in. For a line as long as it was, it moved efficiently and hotel employee's circulated with bottled water. I had requested a King room in Augustus and was disappointed at check-in that not only was an August room not available, but nor was a king non-smoking. So I was given the option to wait an hour for an upgraded room on the 45th floor of Augustus, I waited, was able to use Platinum check-in and 5pm and was not disappointed whatsoever. The room was spacious to say the least. A large sitting area, good sized dining table in addition to the large king-bed. Enormous bathroom with separate jacuzzi tub and glass enclosed shower, dual sinks and a flat screen television. It was also spotless and cleaned on-time each day. All staff that I encountered were very friendly and I found that the dealers and pit bosses were among the friendliest I have encountered in Vegas. The conference hosted a reception at Shadow Bar on Tuesday night and that was one of the highlights of the trip. Playing blackjack in the pool on Thursday was up there as well. With poolside drinks costing well over $10, I was more than happy to play blackjack and get the drinks for free. The pool area is outstanding, \"Garden of Gods\" describes it aptly. My only other real complaints go to the quality of the conference food, which considering the 5-star restaurants on the property, left A LOT to be desired. That, and the smell of smoke throughout all the common area's - the hotel could probably use an upgrade to the ventilation system. I spent time at both Wynn and Encore and felt the smoke permeated those casino's much less.

My husband immediately called housekeeping about the bathroom not being clean and when we returned from dinner a while later, the towel had been removed. Since we had flown most of the day and were tired we decided to eat in the Augustus Cafe for dinner before going to the Donnie and Marie show across the street. We were seated immediately and the man that was also bussing tables got our drink order brought them to us. After 15 minutes, he realized that we still hadn't ordered and brought us some bread, then went to remind our server that we were there. She came to our table about 10 minutes later, apologized, then took our order. Food arrived about 30 minutes later, it was okay, but we were disgusted with the service, except that by the older man who brought our drinks and bread--he tried to make things better for us. The ventilation system at Caesar's doesn't seem to be up to Vegas standards. The lobby and casino were filled with smoke every time we walked through and it was almost unbearable. We went into the casinos at Bellagio, Mirage, Wynn, Pallazio, Aria, and Mandalay Bay, and we did not notice the smoke being anywhere near as strong as it was at Caesar's. One other note, we had to walk through the lobby every time we went to and from our room, and we noticed that there was always a line at the check-in desk--whether it was 8:00 a.m. or 8:00 p.m. or just about anytime in between--they definitely need more people working to get people ckecked in within a reasonable time. On a good note, we ate at Bradley Ogden's restaurant and it was absolutely delicious--we always eat there when we are in Vegas. We also enjoyed having dessert at Serendipty 3--wonderful.

One of the best things about Caesars is that you don't have to walk through the entire casino to get to your room. That gets so old at some of the other properties.

It would be helpful if the staff (or the patrons) would pick up their towels when leaving the pool. It's hard to tell who is in the pool and who left for the day. Drinks seemed a bit pricey at $20/piece, but they are 32 ounces. A couple of $16 martinis at night and the pool drinks start to look reasonable. The snack bar was a bit pricey, but the fruit salad was a perfect lunch on a hot day. Yum! We spent our last day at the spa. The massages are 1/2 price on week days and totally worth it. The use of the roman baths, sauna, and steam room just make it even more valuable. It was a great way to spend our last day as we were given lockers for the entire day.

We got a huge room in the Augustas tower, with 2 beds, massive bathroom with shower and jacuzzi bath. The view was part mountain and part pool, but was a little dark as it had another building infront of it, but when your on the 43rd floor who cares! The room was cleaned daily and if you leave a little tip every day you get plenty of goodies from house keeping. The robes were a nice touch and very handy. The room safe was small and well hidden, and beware the mini barn, it is very sensitive, just looking at it could set it off!.

The ridiculous mini-fridge didn't have a millimeter of space to store anything.

Check-in line moved very quickly. As far as check-in, don't count on doing it before 1p. You'll have to hold your bags in the bell desk before then.

We didn't feel like sitting in the room waiting, so once we had our room, we brought our bags up ourselves. The pool is great, with a specialty drinks menu that goes beyond the usual lame frozen drinks. Skip the sticky sweet stuff from the machines and get the bartender to make you something you'll actually like.

The central strip location is convenient, and free shuttle buses can get you to locations further afield, like the Rio.

We had been planning this trip for 5+ years and always said we would splurge and stay at Caesars Palace. We booked 5 nights in a Deluxe Room in the Augustus Tower 8 months in advance. It's a good thing we did because, as the dates got closer, the room became $400 more expensive. Neither of us have ever written a review on tripadvisor.com but, since we used it so much while researching this trip, I thought I would write a little something. The Good- The mid-strip location of the hotel can't be beat in my opinion. I love the ancient roman theme. We both love the Forum Shops even though most of the stores there are out of our price range. As we had read in previous reviews, there was a long line to check in. The hotel had several (10+) front desk people working, though, and it only took us 20 or so minutes to get through. I used the \"$20 trick\", explained that we were there for our anniversary, and asked for any \"complimentary upgrades\" (specifically a strip/fountain view). We were placed on the 45th floor (almost the top floor) with an awesome view of the Bellagio Fountains. The room itself was nice even though my wife said the colors and patterns were tacky. We especially liked the large spa tub in the bathroom. I really liked how fast the elevators were going up so far. We hardly ever had to wait more than 30 seconds for one to show up. The Bad- First, the outlets in the bathroom did not work. None of them. We contacted the front desk and they said that they would send someone to fix it (yes, I tried pushing the reset button). We came back later in the night and they were working. The next day they weren't working again. We didn't bother calling the front desk again. Next, my wife and I came back to our room at about 2:30am and the door to our room wouldn't unlock. We went downstairs (from the 45th floor) twice to get new keys and it still didn't work. Security and Maintenance tried several different keys and finally had to use a jumbo slim jim type device to open our door. We waited more than an hour in the hallway before getting into our room. This was the morning of our renewal of vows ceremony and we wanted to get a good night's sleep. Then, there was one day that housekeeping did not clean our room (probably because we didn't leave it until 3pm) and we needed clean towels. I went to call the front desk and found that the phone didn't work. It worked fine the day before but now all I got was a busy signal. I commented several times to my wife that I never had these kinds of problems in the cheaper hotels that I have stayed at and I really hadn't expected them in a hotel with the reputation/cost of Caesars Palace. I should mention that we received a $50 comp for our issues with the door lock. Also, as the trip went on, it bothered me more and more that Caesars had stocked the fridge and one shelf in the room with mini bar type snacks and beverages. From reading tripadvisor.com we were aware that we would be billed for these items if they were removed from their positions on the shelf/fridge and we were careful not to do that. A couple of things about this.......1-It was not posted anywhere in the room that we would be billed if we so much as moved these items, 2-There was no room in the fridge for anything that we might have wanted to put in there and since we couldn't move any of the items.....3-This whole set up seemed like some sort of scam of Caesars to get more money from it's guests. If you are someone that was not aware of this and didn't carefully read your bill when you check out then you'd end up paying for things you never used. I'm sure Caesars makes a lot of money of these kinds of misunderstadings. A couple of other things of note.....there are no coffee makers in the rooms. We had to walk through the casino and past the sports book to a food court type area with a coffee/bagel place. I, of course, used this opportunity to place bets on games. This wasn't a big deal necessarily but how hard would it be to have a coffee maker in the room? The Red Lion we stayed at before flying to Vegas had one and it was a hell of a lot cheaper than Caesars. Overall, I still like Caesars and would like to chalk up the negative experiences to bad luck. However, we could have paid 1/2 the money and stayed in a nice room in one the several hotels across the street. I bet those hotels had working outlets in the bathroom, a working phone, and a door lock that actually opened when you put your key in. Maybe they even have coffee makers in one of them. When you shell out as much money as we did to stay at Caesars, you should at least expect the room to be in good working order.

Previously, I have stayed at the Wynn, Mirage, and Luxor and decided to stay at Caesars on this trip due to the status it holds as one of the classic Vegas casinos. One thing you should know if you choose to stay here, and before booking your arriving flight, is that Caesars will not offer you check-in until 1:00pm. They actually had a woman standing in the lobby questioning people in line if they were attempting to check-in and ejecting people from the line if they were not checking out. This was a first for me. I get the fact that they want to focus on the check-outs, but this employee did not even give a \"welcome to caesars\" and her stern demeanor set the tone for our stay. I get the sense (and was explicitly told by the Front Desk) that if you pay for an upgraded room, the quality of the furnishing and amenities is much nicer. I, however, opted to stick with my room in the Roman tower, and I have to say, even with modest expectations, was disappointed. The room itself was very outdated with scratches on the wallpaper and furnishings. The hallways in this tower were dingy and the elevators are in lackluster shape. On the positive side, Caesars has some of the most beautiful swimming pools I have seen in Vegas and the casino itself is very nice. You also cannot beat the location. Caesars is located centrally on the Strip and has one of the nicest (premium) malls in Vegas located directly adjacent to it. I would suggest skipping the buffet. The food quality and ambience were poor and it wasn't worth the cost whatsoever. Flavors buffet, located across the street at Harrah's, is considerably less expensive and with much more variety. Caesars Palace is actually owned by Harrah's and one thing they promote heavily in their hotels is the benefit of \"no resort fees\". One thing I can honestly say is that I would easily pay a bit more to have a much better room and more modern amenities. A better option at a lower cost would be the Mirage, which is located next to Caesars on the strip. The rooms are more modern and the restaurants are better, in my opinion. You also may be able to find the Wynn at a similar price to Caesars from time to time, which is hands down, the nicest resort I have stayed at in Vegas. Bottom line - if you are coming to Vegas for a special occasion or a vacation, there are probably better options on the strip.

He has never been to Vegas and I haven't been in 25 years. Driving in, if you are using valet, stay to your left at the end of Caesars Palace Drive or you will end up in the Forum Tower shops. I think you go right to self-park. We used Valet parking; just a note that the person who comes to your car is the first of two people that will help you, so when you tip be sure to wait for the actual person who will be taking care of your car and bags. I ended up tipping twice. The second person takes care of your car and getting your bags to the Bellman. $5 seems appropriate for that service. I think it may have helped to get my bags delivered quickly (in less than ten minutes after we arrived in our room). We stayed in the Forum Tower Royal Suite and it was very nice for the price; we paid under $600 for two nights (a Thursday and a Friday) on a 50% off deal (code-50SUITE). Our room 6306 had a peek view north on the strip and of the mountains in the distance. It would not have been worth the full price of $1200; there seem to be way too many other options at that price. Google \"Forum Royal Tower Suite\" and someone has posted a youtube video that shows exactly what you get. For the room, check-in was easy since we used the new system TEXTPRESS where the hotel sends you a text the day before your check-in; you check-in and they have your key waiting at the Bell Desk. It took less than 30 seconds because there was no line to wait in. The person behind the desk suggested that it will only work to speed up checkin as long as not too many folks utilize the system. Also there isn't really a chance for an upgrade because the Bell Desk doesn't have control over room assignments. In the suite there was a foldout couch but the couch was more comfortable; we ordered two extra pillows and blankets from housekeeping. He also brought sheets without my asking. I tipped him $3. Checkout on the TV was quick and easy, and we went down to get our car, handed the guy our card and tipped him. I do not think guests remember to tip him because he was very appreciative of the $2 I handed him and I could hear him put us in front of the line of people waiting for their car, had us wait in front of his desk rather than the Valet waiting area and had our car delivered to us there. I tipped the person who delivered our car $3. She was also very appreciative. I essentially tipped everyone who did just about anything for us. They count on that as part of their way to make ends meet. I did not tip the Bell Person who handed me my key and I didn't tip housekeeping because they just left the couch bed a mess with pillows and blankets all over. Had they done just that little bit, I would have left $5 for the two nights. THE TRIP: Night one we purchased a 24-hr pass on the DUECE (RTC transit) for $7 each (paid exact change on the bus in front of the Flamingo) and went to downtown Vegas to eat, see the light show (which is every hour on the hour starting at 7 PM) and gamble. We ate at the buffet at Main Street Station (see map http://www.cheapovegas.com/index.php) It was 15 dollars each and was just okay; sure it would have been fine if we had had a few drinks. Then we watched some street performances and the light show which was pretty cool---can't really explain it, you have to see it. After the light show we went to gamble for the first time ever for each of us. We heard gambling for first timers was cheaper, easier and more friendly downtown than on the strip. While we do not know what it is like to gamble on the strip because we never did, our experience downtown was great. We played blackjack at El Cortez, and the dealers were very helpful in teaching us the ropes. We gambled for a couple hours and came out a little ahead, tipped the dealers and headed back to the strip on the DUECE. It was a terrific first night. Night two, we explored the strip, ate lunch in the Eiffel Tower at the Paris hotel. It was good and cost us about $85 with no drinks. Then we hopped back on the DUECE and visited the Pawn Stars Pawn Shop. It was small and unremarkable. In the evening we went to eat at the Bellagio Buffet, but the line was way too long (maybe an hour, maybe two---my son stayed in line while I went to find an alternative). When I came back twenty minute later he had moved about a fourth of the way through the line-maybe a third. Regardless we were able to get into Le Cirque to eat at the bar. It is very tough to get a seat without a reservation on a Friday at the last minute. Picasso had a table but we didn't like their menu as much. The meal was very good; Jean was an excellent bartender and took good care of us, but at almost three hundred dollars with only one drink, it probably isn't really a good choice unless it is a super special occasion. In the end, sitting at the bar was more fun than sitting in the restaurant. Finally we saw the Blue Man Group. It got mixed reviews but we thought it was great fun. We were middle of the theatre in row F. It was a little too close. Would have been better to be about 4-5 rows farther back I think. Row H, seats 9-11 seemed the most comfortable, no one in front so good leg room and close enough to see the details of the show.", "Date": "March 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "jersey shore", "Title": "\u201cPut on your walking shoes...\u201d", "Author": "rumridge", "ReviewID": "UR59636155", "Content": "We stayed in the Augustus tower , very nice room , view of the Bellagio fountains.The room had a king size bed , table and sofa , did not come with a fridge,but they sent one up.The bathroom was large, stand up shower with a large tub with jets.The pool is on the other side of the property probably a 2 mile walk through the casino and shops, Great pool , but don't forget anything in the room, All in all I would stay here again , Fun place ,", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pharm214", "Title": "\u201cGreat time!\u201d", "Author": "Pharm214", "ReviewID": "UR59624598", "Content": "After booking an extremely cheap package deal through Southwest Airlines, I read reviews of the room I had reserved (Classic) and got extremely nervous.

I then tried the $20 tip trick for a free upgrade (which I read about in other reviews), but it didn't work. He did tell us, however, that we could upgrade to the Augustus tower with a Bellagio fountain view for only $40 per night. Since we had gotten the room for so cheap through the Southwest deal, we gratefully accepted the upgrade. We were given a room on the 40th floor with an awesome view of the fountains and the strip. The room was enormous, with two beds, a couch with a coffee table, a table with two chairs, and a desk with chairs. The room also had a decent closet and a gigantic bathroom (tub, shower, two sinks, and separate toilet room). Everything was very clean as well. We had no problem with noise. Room service was always excellent and timely. The elevators were speedy and the walk to the lobby of the hotel wasn't bad. The pool was good (half of the seating was always covered in shade, so we had to get there by 10AM to get decent seats), but the drinks were expensive ($15 for a pina coloda).

When we arrived at Caesars Palace the check-in was quick and efficient and we stayed in a Deluxe room in the Augustus Tower. They upgraded us to a Deluxe Premium room and it was amazing, I have never stayed in a room so big! The Augustus Tower is so close to the entrance that we were out and on the strip in less than 5 minutes. It was a perfect room and had views of the Bellagio fountains. We stayed for 5 nights in total and never once heard anyone on the corridors or slamming doors or noisy neighbours. On the day of the wedding I had my hair and make-up done in the salon and the girls there are really friendly and helpful and listened to what I wanted. I loved the manicure and pedicure sipping champagne it was bliss. We had 6 guests who came from the UK to our wedding so we booked the Romano Chapel at the hotel. It was a beautiful and intimate chapel. I had booked Julius Caesar to walk me down the aisle and he brought Cleopatra with him for my husband-to-be! They were absolutely fantastic and I would recommend them if you want something different at your wedding. The photographer was really good and took allsorts of different shots inside and outside Caesars Palace. Our favourite photo is outside the fountains to the entrance of Caesars Palace at dusk. We held our reception dinner in Neros Restaurant and ate Lollipop steaks. They are the biggest steaks any of us had ever seen! and were so delicious. Yes they were a little pricey but this was our wedding day and we wanted something special. The staff there were amazing too.

So definitely ask for the \"new\" tower if you plan on staying here. The service at Caesars I found to be real crummy. Most of our group would drink at the Sea Horse bar and the bartenders were lazy when it came to taking any orders for drinks. I almost felt like I had to chase them down to pay for a cocktail. I did gamble a bit at the bar and they would offer me a complimentary, but that was after 10-15 minutes of playing the machine. The bar staff were definitely not very attentive. The conference staff we had for our convention I found to be extremely rude. Many of the others in the group had very similar feelings. The wait staff were not very helpful when it came to the smallest requests. It kind of felt like by requesting something from them, they were doing you a favor. One of my colleagues told me that one of the staff serving soup was real rude by walking off when it was his turn to be served. The staff didn't comment to him about coming back, so he tried to serve himself and out of nowhere the staff member came back and scorned him.

My only complaint was that the first time the room was cleaned, the staff took the hotel robes off the hook in the bathroom and inadvertently took my nightgown. So damn, I had buy a new one! The rest of the facility was nice, a little loud and smokey in the older part of the casino, but the Forum casino was very nice and cw's were very attentive. The Lago Buffet was reasonably priced and pretty good, although not as good as some I have had. Enjoyed dinner at Mesa and sushi at Hykumi (sp?). I had a terrible burger at the food court, though my husband had pretty good fish and chips, and he knows his fish & chips. Room service was prompt and polite, although of course pricey.

Having to queue to check in. With over 3,000 rooms, and a limited check-in window, more than three desk clerks would be nice. 2. The room was quite small and while the beds were nice, the rest of the decor was cheap. The over-hallway aircon vent reminded me of a cheap dorm. However the bathroom was fairly nice. 3. The TV in the bathroom mirror did not work as the remote control panel was cracked. 4. We got shoved in a corner room which gave us an oblique view of the carpark. Not even a full view of the carpark. The hotel is large, and it takes quite a bit of time to get anywhere. Even though the Forum Tower was one of the closest to the carpark, it was about ten minutes. This got annoying, especially when the car park was too full to park close to the lifts. Pluses? Well, the room was quiet. Perhaps as the door appeared, by its weight, to be made of solid lead. There was no in-room fridge (aside from the drinks one), but one was promptly delivered, though took up more real estate of course. Check-in, when we arrived at the counter, was efficient and not too impersonal. The place is a Vegas icon, and I had to give it a go, but not again. Sure, the ambience of the lobby, the casino floor, and the shops were nice, but the rooms were simply not worth the price.

We came in early ( 2 nights) for a convention (3 nights paid for by the company ) and booked the room on the hotels website. The total for the 2 nights was about 400. incl taxes,- Palace Tower Deluxe room, on my email confirmation. I read about the 'slipping the check-in staff a $20' and I tried it. I thought what the heck, maybe we can at least stay in the same room for the entire time, and if we get an upgrade..all the better. He took it without a misstep and proceeded to ' see what he could do for us'...we ended up with a Palace Tower Jr Suite ( king bed, larger sitting room, and 2 bathrooms, one with a spa tub and a huge shared shower). I did show enthusiasm and was very appreciative. However when I checked out..I saw that the room was half what I expected to pay! According to the bill at check out, each night was exactly half of what I thought I had to pay..I think I got comped without knowing it! I have been checking my credit card but so far (its been a week, ) but the only charge to my card was the original deposit back in December of half of the total estimated charges, and credit for a win that I left on my room account. I was really happy with the room, and staff and hotel in general, so now that I actually got the vacation for half price, I like it even more! The room, was very clean and spacious..The bed was very soft and comfortable. Feather pillows are not my thing, but you can get a different kind,. It had a safe, a large closet, iron and board, and robes. No coffeemaker. It looked just like the pictures on the website. It was a bit dated..you could see wear and tear on the rug and in the bathrooms, but not enough to detract from the decor. Our friends got upgraded to a huge suite in the Roman towers and that room was very large and VERY dated. A total flashback to the seventies..But they loved it! It was an upgrade they got just by mentioning celebrating a birthday. It had marble steps leading up to the room and then down into the room. Quite posh in its day I am sure. I called housekeeping twice and recieved my requested items ( a foam pillow, extra towels ) within an hour, despite the obvious number of rooms full due to the convention. I was careful not to use the refrigerator or move any of the items on the special tray. There was a note saying handling can result in extra charges. The location was super. Be prepared to walk. I bet it took 15 mins just to get down to and out the lobby! The Bellagio is next door..and their Sunday brunch was THE best meal we ate in Vegas (Emerils at MGM Grand was the worst) The Deuce Bus picks up just across the street at Paris ( dont miss the Eiffel Tower Tour or lunch at Mon Ami Gabi on the terrace out front ) to go up to Venetian (that was hands down the most beautiful hotel I saw) or in front of the Forum shops to go down to MGM Grand (dont miss the real lion habitat and if you like to give your opinions, the tv show screening ) or Luxor (whats up with no picture taking allowed inside the hotel??) The fountains at Bellagio were wonderful and so romantic at night. Dont bother with Sirens Something at Treasure Island. Not worth the walk or wait. Walk thru the shops at the Forum Shops just to see the grand fountains. And the Venetian for the gorgeous frescoes on the ceiling and architecture. The Wynn was a bit farther down and we didnt go beyond the Venetian/Palazzo, so all my 'bests' are from Luxor to Palazzo. Went to KA at MGM Grand. It was amazing. How did they get the stage to float like that? The engineering had the guys we went with wondering for hours. It was spectacular. I didnt think the story was that hard to follow. Buy the program and read it before hand. In fact try to get your souvenirs before the show, as after -its a people jam in that small gift shop. The program spells it right out for you. The music was enchanting and not distracting. A very very fine production indeed. Some friends went to the Beatles Cirque show and were not impressed like we were with our show. Some pools at Caesars were being renovated and you could only go in part of the complex. It was stil a lovely area and quite private, as the temps were not conducive to much pool time. The Lago Buffet at Caesars was a bit disappointing. For dinner, go next door to the Bellagio. Or to Paris. The breakfast was fine for the price ($18 PP I think). Considering a to go breakfast sandwich and coffee would set you back 10 bucks easy from the convenient and busy Payards bistro, it was a better option. The Asian Noodle place was okay, but not worth the price, we thought. Had lunch weekday at Mon Ami Gabi across the street at Paris. It was over $60 for 2, inc tip. ( soup and sandwiches, no drinks! ) Pricey but quite good. French onion soup was terrific. The waiter had such an attitude, we thought he didnt like us at first. We did get him to smile and say he just wanted us to have the most 'real' Parisian experience possible. Then he sighed and swiped up my husbands bread crumbs with a small brush and disgustedly put them on the empty plate before he cleared it. I think he made eye contact with us twice! When we asked questions about the menu, he acted totally bored and put out. We laughed - it was very fun playing around with him. Fitness center is not free..fyi. After all that good food though, I needed a good workout! We enjoyed our stay at Caesars Palace. Great location, great staff. Vegas wouldn't be my first choice for a family vacation or even a vacation for my husband and I alone. It was nice to go once, and that was enough.

There was wet paint outside one day with no warning signs and i ruined a pair of shorts, no one from the hotel would accept responsibility for this, The cash machine in the casino only gave me $20 when i keyed in $50, and was subsequently charged for $50, again no one would take responsibility for this.. Pool area was poor, they, along with many other vegas hotels have private \"european bathing\" aka topless girls, which don't have to pay to go in, they then try to force guys to either pay to go in or use the bottle service for champagne etc etc, so the only remaining option for our trip was pretty much an all male free for all around a small round pool.. no shade anywhere.. there was construction work going on while we were there, so it was both noisy and dusty by the pool.. Pure, the nightclub, is good if you can get in, turns out having 10 people taking up 5 rooms isn't enough for the hotel to consider giving you any sort of preference on getting in, so again, for the guys you have to \"buy bottles\" which will start from $350 + tax + tip.. or que for hours with everyone else.. this was pretty much standard for all Vegas clubs if you are in a group of males though..

(2/9-2/13). This was our first time at the hotel but not to Las Vegas. We typically stay at the best deal we can get on Hotwire or Priceline. Frankly, I was disappointed. Hotel room: We stayed in a Classic room at the Palace Tower. (I think they will assign you there when buying through Hotwire). The room itself is outdated; a very old, gold finished ornate room- which has a huge jacuzzi tub in the bedroom with a lot of tacky mirrors. Pros: The shower was nice with a steam mist option, the housekeeping service was very good. Con: the mattress was like sleeping on a rock. Room service: We ordered coffee each morning. Yes, it was expensive. However, the service was OUTSTANDING. They have a very professional tone going on with all the service folks- making you feel like they are happy you are there. Even when call to just place the order. Great job to whomever is responsible for that program. Location: The location is perfect. You can walk to the Paris and Planet Hollywood in 5 minutes or the other way to the Mirage or Harrahs. Gambling: We gambled very little at the hotel. For me, it was too large and the tables were not full enough. We went to Planet Hollywood were the dealers are very friendly and we gambled at the Fortune Pai Gow tables most of our visit. Other comments: Regardless of the time, the registration line was always long; be prepared to wait. We checked in at 10pm however each day we would walk by the desk and there was always a line with no more than 2 people working. It seems like they need more help.

We were offered an upgrade due to the \"poor weather\" at $30/night and we moved from a classic room to a larger room in the Palace Tower.

Great location for catching the monorail on the other side of the street at Flamingos or catching the tram from Bellagios to Monte Carlo.

We are late 30\u2019s and late 50somethings. We have stayed at most of the 4 star hotels on the strip. This was yet another delightful stay at Caesars Palace! When we checked in (@ 3pm on a Monday) the line was about 75 people deep but it went very quickly (about 15 minuets) and by the time we were headed to our room there were about 300 people in line and that line was there for awhile. We had booked a deluxe room and received an upgrade for the cost of a smile. We had a petite suite on the 42nd floor of the Augustus Tower and it was delightful. The room was tucked away in a back corner and it was silent. We never heard another soul; it was like we had the whole hotel to ourselves although it looked as if there were 2 or 3 conventions happening while we were there. The large room had 2 very large windows (one facing the strip and one facing the pools), dining table, sofa, chair and ottoman, king size bed, and a super huge closet. The bathroom was the same bath room you get with a deluxe room, water closet, spa tub, double sinks and glass shower. Really the very best thing about this room is how quiet it was all day and all night. The service is always great in this hotel. We had room service twice and they were helpful and speedy with the service. The maids were very respectful to our things and did a great job of cleaning and did not disturb us when we had our sign out. This is not always the case in Las Vegas hotels. Just one complaint about the hotel, they have closed Cleopatra\u2019s Barge to make way for a lounge singer. I am sad to see it gone. It was one of the only placed in Las Vegas that you could find a respectfully fun over 30\u2019s crowd and not have to listen to hip-hop music all night. I know the new act might be great for the masses but The Barge was always a great place to get your groove on if you are little old school and like rock-n-roll and a disco tune now and then. Farwell to an institution! We did find an ok substitution for dancing at the Bellagio\u2019s Fontana Bar. I guess we will just have to give our money to them from now on. One more thing\u2026if you are in town and want to see a great Latin-Classic Rock & Roll fusion concert\u2026go see Santana at the Hard Rock\u2019s, The Joint. If you like to dance get an isle seat.

Everyone hovers around the front desk waiting for the line to open at 1pm. Luckily, we were towards the front of that line. If you were unlucky enough to arrive later in the day, the wait was nearly 2 hours. We were booked in a Classic room in the Forum tower and were told the hotel was fully booked so there were no upgrades available. We did the $20 trick and suddenly there was an upgrade available to the Augustus Tower. It should be noted that as the day wore on, they ran out of standard rooms. Other people in our group had to be put in suites because no standard rooms were available. That sounds great, except for the fact that they had to move after the first night to a standard room. What a pain. Our room was fine, but not as nice as the rooms in the hotels I listed above. Housekeeping was OK, but not as good as the other hotels. For instance, if I used the hairdryer and rushed out of the room in the morning leaving it on a chair, it would still be there when I got back, cord strewn across the floor, rather than being put away. The bed was made, but it was evident that less time was taken to \u201cneaten\u201d the room. Otherwise, Caesar\u2019s is just depressing in comparison to the other casinos.

With a large hotel, things are bound to happen, but Caesar's bends over backwards to make it right. As far as the gambling, we had better luck down the street at the Mirage. Caesars jacked up the table amounts more than we wanted to spend. If you are in to blues bands, BB King Club at the Mirage has an awesome house band. They rocked. Keep a smile on your face and a positive attitude and your experience should be good one. Caesar's location is unbeatable and worth paying a little extra. One more thing, the Qua Spa was awesome. Had the Hot Stone Massage(awesome) and was given access the rest of the day to all the amenities of the baths, sauna, etc. I was in heaven.

Our room was overlooking the gorgeous pool area. We came here because of an invitation for a FREE NCL cruise (we were going on anyways) offered by Harrah's (which owns Caesar's Palace and several other hotels on the Vegas strip). We didn't gamble here (never win), but it's a great location in the mid-section of the strip. We walk over to another Harrah's property (Imperial Palace or Flamingo) to play...then we took a complimentary shuttle over to the Rio (another Harrah's hotel) and enjoyed their famous World Buffet. The food is super expensive at Caesar's, even coffee (plain jane coffee) is $5.00 for a cup! You can take a complimentary shuttle over to the Rio and walk to the Palms or Gold Coast (off the strip) for better gambling,, less expensive delicious food, or catch a movie over at the Palms.

We upgraded our room to the Augustus Tower and it was definitely worth the money. We were in room 3887 and had views of the strip and the pools. Our room was HUGE. A nice sitting area with a chair and small sofa, a round table with two chairs. The dresser had 2 long drawers and a small drawer but there were cubbies with doors in the top part that worked well for storing smaller items. We arrived early (around 11am) and checked our bags with the bell staff. Check in is not until 1pm. My husband and I walked around the hotel and then down the strip. We had a great lunch at Margaritaville - the burgers are yummy! (Huge but yummy!) We went back to the hotel at 1pm to check in. The line was a little long but it moved quickly. The desk staff was very friendly and helpful. Our bags arrived up to our room in about 10 minutes - we were very surprised it was that quick. If you are a non-smoker you need to check out Slice. It is non-smoking and has video poker/blackjack/slots at the bar. They also have Fat Tire on tap!! You can order pizza by the slice and it is pretty good. I wish I had found this area before our last day. Ceasar's is not incredibly smokey but there are times where you may sit by a smoker and it is a little bothersome - but expected at a casino. It's nice that they provide an alternative for non-smokers. We ate at Augustus Cafe - yum! Everything our party ordered was fantastic - cannot go wrong at the Augustus Cafe. George is a great waiter - very friendly and knowledgeable. We also at Rao's - it was good Italian - a little pricey for what you got and the service was not that good. We were a 6 top table inbetween two other 6 tops. We felt invisible to our waiter - he spent a lot of time at the other two tables but we hardly saw him. I also went to the spa. That was incredible!! I have been to a lot of spas and this is one of the best. The Roman Baths are unreal - so relaxing. I also had a Deep Tissue massage from Manuela - she is fantastic - highly recommend her. A great massage therapist. They also have an Artic Plunge room and Herbal and Cedarwood steam rooms. Great showers fully stocked and a nice area to dry your hair.

This was my first stay at this property and I was comped the entire time as I usually only play at Harrah\u2019s properties. I booked and was given a room in the Forum Tower. I stayed in room 5109. A couple of notes about the rooms in the Forum Tower. Rooms ending in odd numbers face in toward other buildings or the parking garage, and even rooms face toward the strip area. Also, it appeared that I had a room on a high floor. In actuality, the room numbers start at 5000 and you push \u201c50\u201d in the elevator, which is about the fifth floor in this building. Also, the Registration Desk is a ways from the Forum Elevators, and navigating this large casino can be confusing. The room was just as pictured on the website. I have also downloaded pictures of the room. It has recently been renovated and is in fine condition. The bathroom was spacious and nice, however there was no bathtub. Only a large shower, with two shower heads. This was not a concern to me, but may be for some people. The safe is in the closet, which was nice to lock up valuables, but it was rather small \u2013 it was tall, but not deep. The view from the room was nothing spectacular. I looked out over the roof of the casino toward another tower. I could see the Flamingo, if I turned my head just right. But as I wrote earlier, it was a free room so I didn\u2019t expect a great view. The bed was comfortable and the flat-screen television worked well. Few channels, but this is Vegas and the casino doesn\u2019t want to encourage people staying in and watching shows. The housekeeping staff was excellent. I usually leave a couple of dollars each day as these people are typically underpaid. I always found the room was well cleaned and items needed were replaced. I did have a light out in the entry way and called to have it replaced. The person was there in five minutes. I was impressed. Overall, the room was nice and comfortable. I found easy access to the casino, the food court, and the Forum Shops from the Forum Tower elevators.

We are rewards members and booked through their site and were quite pleased that we could get 5 comped nights and only one night at a discounted rate in the Forum tower during the holiday season. We stayed the 24th through the 30th of December. We arrived a little before check-in time but were able to get our room without any problems. There were several people ahead of us to check in, but the line seemed to move quickly. I noticed a few people walking with canes were ushered to the front of one of the preferred lines, while my husband, who also uses a cane, wasn't given this preferential treatment. As we approached the front of the line, one of the desk clerks noticed my husband's cane and asked him to move to the front of the line. We declined since by that time only one other person was in line ahead of us. We had booked one of the upgraded rooms in the Forum tower and were offered an upgrade--I wish we would have taken it. Our room was nice, but we were disappointed that we didn't have a bathtub or a coffee maker in our room. We were somewhat disappointed in the quality of the cleaning crew, but I suspect most of that was due to the holiday season. On the 25th, only half the room was cleaned but we were in the room on the phone at the time and they probably just didn't get back to finish our room. On the 26th, we left our room fairly late because my husband was a little ill from all the rich food we had been eating, and our room wasn't touched by the cleaning crew that day. On the remaining days, the room was cleaned but wasn't clean early enough for us to come back to the room and take an afternoon nap. We thought that the rooms had been recently remodeled but there were scuff marks all around the bed frame and the leather chair at the desk seemed to have been used a lot. I noticed that some of the bed linens had holes in them and at least one had stains of what looked like coffee or soda. One little touch that I liked so much on previous stays was that the cleaning staff would have a fresh bucket of ice in the room when you checked in. In these days of water conservation that isn't acceptable any more. I wouldn't believe the card about if you hang up your towels you are saying that you'll reuse them--I noticed the cleaning crew taking neat, folded unused towels out of a room and placing them in with other obviously used towels. One thing to note about the key cards that they give you--one of ours ended up getting wiped out and we were told by one of the maintenance crew that they were very sensitive and even putting them next to another credit card could wipe them out. This was also confirmed by the front desk when we went to get a new card--maybe they should let you know about this at check-in because the registration desk is quite a hike from the Forum Tower. Unless you are up for an adventure, don't bother trying the self-park. My husband tried it thinking that it would be a little quicker than valet parking. After driving around the parking garage for 15 minutes without finding an open parking spot, we gave up and went to valet parking. More than once, we had to show our room key because valet parking was only accepting registered guests. Given the situation in self-park, I can understand why. Dining was good, but I'd like to see some sort of restaurant serving a full breakfast on the Forum tower side of the casino. There is a place to get coffee and pastries, but if you want more than that you have to go across the casino. We normally don't make dining plans and were disappointed that more than once we were told that we'd have a 2+ hour wait for a table without reservations. On one occasion when I did try to make a reservation, I canceled the reservation because I was required to choose the menu for the entire party when making the reservation.

The line at check-in wasn't long but the customer service wasn't good. The woman didn't really even look at us. We were in room 597 and walked the longest hallway of my life to get there. Our room was basically empty of furniture. We had 2 double beds, the stand with TV, one end table, one chair, and one nightstand. All the pictures online and the room description included a chaise lounge so we immediately called down and asked to have our missing furniture delivered. The front desk said there was no chaise lounges in any rooms that weren't suites but they would get us some furniture. In the next 24 hours we made 4 phone calls before we finally had a chaise lounge delivered. During the 3rd phone call my mom suggested bringing us one out of an empty room and the front desk responded that they couldn't do that because then that room would be without. What?? Even with all of our furniture the room was still not good. The beds literally turned up in the corners and everything is very old and used looking. Also note that the room was an adjoining one and there was absolutely no sound proofing between the rooms. My aunt stayed in a room on the same floor with 2 adjoining rooms and she barely got any sleep for 6 nights even though all her neighbours did was talk and not loudly. Caesar's is huge so be prepared to do lots of walking. I did like the casino and the Forum Shops being right there. Love the Cheesecake Factory in the Forum Shops so it was a great location for that. The room was always cleaned although some days they didn't always replace the towels so one day we had to call to have a bathmat delivered. The food options on site are very expensive. The Java Coast coffee place is $4 for a small cup of coffee.

There is a nice french bistro style restaurant that is very reasonably priced on the way to our room that we patronized twice during our stay- that was probably the highlight of our trip at this casino. All in all, I wouldnt stay here again as Ive had a better time at smaller south strip hotels like the mandalay bay and the luxor", "Date": "December 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Clemente, California", "Title": "\u201cDid Caesar actually live here\u201d", "Author": "coastalbrett", "ReviewID": "UR52015640", "Content": "I have been coming to Vegas for a long, long time and had never stayed at Caesars.

The lady at guest service/concierge was rude and unhelpful. On our second last day of stay, we asked for information for the airport shuttle and were told that we should have booked the return shuttle at the airport. She said that since the shuttle company is not affiliated with the hotel, she was not able to make reservation for us. She didn't even provide us the shutlle phone number to call. Her tone of voice and body language told us they she didn't even want to talk to us. At the other 3 previous hotels we stayed, they were more than happy to help us make the reservation. Failing to get the information we needed, we went next door to the Bellagio and was able to get the help we needed even though the staff knew that we were not their hotel guests. Don't eat at their buffet restaurant. The hot food quality is poor, the selection is 1/4 of Bellagio's buffet and costs more than the Bellagio.

At check in we were offered an upgrade from our priceline booking for an extra $40 per night which my wonderful boyfriend accepted. We were put into a gorgeous room over 600sf with a whirlpool tub and an amazing view of the strip. The bed and linens were so comfortable i wanted to stuff the whole thing into my bag and take it all home with me. The whirlpool tub was a great treat after hours of walking around and drinking, and it was actually large enough to fit the both of us! He loved that there was a small plasma TV in the RR to watch as well. The hotel, casino and the forum shops are filled with amazing artwork in every nook and cranny. After strolling through all the other hotels on the strip we both agreed that our hotel was the most impressive with the Venetian and Bellagio a close second ( however we did not see the rooms in those hotels) One important thing to remember which may be in many of the hotels is that if you move any of the mini bar or conveience items from their place they are automatically and electronically entered onto your bill as being used. If you touch anything there, go through the checkout line and check your bill closely to ensure that you were not charged for anything you didn't use. We had moved everything out of the little fridge to make room for our liquor and the initial bill was over $200 when in reality we only had used about $20 worth of items.

We got an awesome deal online and I thought it would be great to stay there because of it\u2019s awesome location and because of the Forum Shops which houses more high fashion designers under one roof than any other place in the world. After making our reservation I came to trip advisor and was horrified at the reviews and pictures of the Classic Room. I told my husband about the $20 tip I read about and said we needed to upgrade, even if we had to pay for it. When we arrived at the hotel at 1:00pm there were about 50 people in line in front of us but it only took 20-25minutes. My husband put the $20 between his credit card and ID and told the man we were there celebrating our first anniversary and was wondering if he could help us out with an upgrade. The man said, give me a second, I want to get you something good.\u201d Believe it or not he upgraded us all the way to a Suite in the Augustus Tower! There was NEVER a wait at our elevators! It was so quiet and peaceful in our room. The only noise we ever heard was when people were using water in their room. The room was very nice but I have to say I would not pay full price for it. Although it was decorated very nicely and was very roomy, there was also some wear and tear. The floor boards had scruff marks everywhere, the carpet looked a bit old as did the sofa, the wood furniture has pieces of wood missing like it needed to be sanded and stained again and the caulking around the edges of the shower floor was black and grimy. It\u2019s not that big a deal but if we had paid thousands of dollars for a week stay in the room we would have been a bit disappointed. Thank goodness it was free! The bathroom was wonderful! There were actually 2! My husband had a sink and toilet in his and in my bathroom there was a sink, toilet and bidet, and LARGE Jacuzzi tub! Plus there was a 2 person shower! The bed was comfortable and the linens were very nice. The fridge was stocked with alcohol and drinks and when we called housekeeping to ask for it to be emptied they said they couldn\u2019t do that because the fridge was not for personal use. An orange juice one morning for $6 and a coke was about $8. If you go down to the casino level to one of those little stores that has medicines, bathroom necessities, and snacks you can get the same size coke for only $2. Anything you take from the fridge will be replaced by housekeeping the next day and they keep a record of what was removed. We were very impressed with our housekeeping. About 1 hour after we got in our room our housekeeper came to introduce himself, asked if we needed anything, mentioned the normal time he would clean our room and if that would work for us. He was very good at his job. Caesars Palace is large but I can\u2019t understand why people complain about that. It\u2019s Vegas and most of the hotel/casinos are big. In Vegas you do a lot of walking and that\u2019s just the way it is. Luckily Caesars didn\u2019t smell as bad smoke-wise as other places. As for gambling--I don\u2019t gamble but Caesars had a lot of machines and tables and people having a good time. The hotel/casino can be a bit confusing but take some time to look at the map you get when you check in and then walk around a little. You\u2019ll get it in no time! I was disappointed in the food court. It is expensive, small portions, and doesn\u2019t have a broad selection. There is a pizza place where a slice of pizza and drink is about $15. There was no McDonalds, Subway or what you would expect in a normal food court. We tried the food court once and didn\u2019t go back. The Augustus Caf\u00e9 is like an expensive Dennys/IHOP. We tried it for lunch and were pleased and FULL. The portions are big. I got a roast beef dip for $16 and my husband a bread bowl with soup for $12. Even though it was tasty and convenient we decided not to go back but instead, for the same price, go to buffets along the strip for lunch which normally go for about $16 a person and you get a huge variety plus a drink. I tried the Caesar buffet for dinner one night and was disappointed. I wrote a separate review for this but let me say I\u2019ve tried almost every buffet in Vegas and this by far had the smallest selection. I thought to myself, \u201cis there another section of food somewhere that I am missing?\u201d The food was decent but was nothing special. It\u2019s a lovely place and they don\u2019t cram the place full of tables like other Vegas buffets, but the food is not worth the $38 per person. Other buffets seriously have 3 times the selection of Caesars. Qua Baths and Spa is wonderful. I wrote a separate, more detailed review for that too. Give it a try and you won\u2019t be disappointed. There is a separate men\u2019s and women\u2019s spa and there is a \u201cclothing optional policy.\u201d Day passes are $45 and give you access to the gym, Roman Baths, Steam Rooms, Tea Room and you can also help yourself to snacks, fruit, coffee, tea, and fruit juices. Well worth the $45 but if you are considering a massage try to go Monday through Thursday when a classic massage is only $90. It\u2019s a good massage but nowhere near the $140 I paid for it. If I found a good deal I\u2019d definitely stay at Caesars Palace again.

Then again, in hindsight, it made sense as this hotel seems to have grown beyond its capacity and without much thought about quality maintenance. We arrived at the hotel at 11 pm after a long flight and lined up at the check-in for 20 minutes to be then told that they had given away the non-smoking Augustus room that we had booked months in advance, and that they only available room they had was a smoking room in the Forum Tower. We were offered an apology and an upgrade to a junior suite in the Palace Tower and a free mini fridge rental for compensation. To the hotel's credit, all the staff at the registration were friendly and helpful - even though one managed to authorize and get a denial when he accidentally re-authorized the card, asking us for another credit card to authorize in the end (we didn't find out until days later that that was what happened). We ate a late dinner at the 24-hour place (not worth the price - Caesar restaurants were on average $3-5 more expensive than other places; a hot chocolate and croissant was easily over $10, and a normal breakfast was over $40). Our smoking room at the Forum Tower was ok save for the broken TV in the bathroom mirror. The next morning we inquired about our new room and were told that we had to check out of the current room by 10 am and check our luggage with the bell desk until we could get the key cards to our new room between 1-3 pm. Because we already had tickets for a show from 1 - 5, we decided to go to the desk before 12 pm and ask for a room, and we were lucky enough that another junior suite had been cleaned at that time. When we went to ask for our luggage to be sent up from the bell desk, we were told to go to the outside one (valet / luggage) to retrieve it - and there we were told that we had to wait for them to be retrieved from the basement... all this despite the fact that we told them that we were not checking in / out. Finally, at my partner's insistance, the bell service agreed to send someone up with our luggage (a very friendly and helpful hotel clerk). Our hotel staff the night before had recommended that we take the Junior Suite at the Palace Tower over the Deluxe Room at the Augustus Tower - so we went with his recommendations but I cannot help but wonder if we would have enjoyed the smaller but newer room better - The Palace Tower room was spacious and nice, but at closer look you could tell that it was worn - the corners of the door frames were frayed and discolored; one of the faucets (we had two bathrooms) was loose and made it hard to shut the water off; and it took forever to get hot water in the shower. Overall, our stay was just ok - most of the staff that we interacted with were helpful and friendly (especially the registration staff, the cleaning staff and the bell person who brought our luggage up), but a couple of them were just plain rude.

I decided to make a weekend out of the trip. I only made a reservation to stay at Caesars Palace for one night as I had plans to see the Grand Canyon and come back to Vegas for two nights at MGM before returning home. Thankfully I only made plans to stay at Caesars one night in advance or else I would have been scrambling to find other lodging after my return from the Grand Canyon. My one night experience has deterred me from ever staying at this resort again. At check-in I decided to pay the extra for an upgrade. When I got to the room everything looked clean and nice until I went into the bathroom. I looked in the tub (separate from the shower) and found a significant quantity of a substance that appeared to be blood or vomit or possibly even a combination of the two. I immediately called the front desk. The staff was very accommodating and said that someone would be up to the room immediately to clean the tub. I was also offered a $50 voucher for food/gaming to make up for the inconvenience. I had no intention of using the tub regardless of it being clean or not \u2013 so I accepted their offer. I decided to take a quick shower and unpack before housekeeping made it up to clean the tub \u2013 I was almost finished in the shower when I turned around and something caught my eye about 6 inches above my head. I looked up and hanging on the shower wall was a used bandage tape, about 4 inches long. I was absolutely disgusted. I got out of the shower and called the front desk to have my room switched. I had to repack anything that I already unpacked and walk back down to the lobby and wait on line for almost 20 minutes to get a room change. The staff again was accommodating and upgraded me to a nicer room. I got to the new room but didn\u2019t have time to unpack or shower \u2013 at this point I had already missed most of a dinner with co-workers and barely made it to a 7:00 showing of \u201cLe Reve\u201d that I already had tickets for. When I got out of \u201cLe Reve\u201d my girlfriend called \u2013 her plane had just landed and she would be at the Caesars within an hour. I went back to Caesars and was still disgusted; I called management to have them verify that their records showed that everything in the previous room had been cleaned even though they missed the bandage and the substance in the bathtub. After my girlfriend arrived we took a walk around Vegas and played a few games. We had a nice dinner and a few drinks and returned to the room. At this point I was almost getting over the mess I had to deal with earlier that afternoon. I took another shower, checked the cleanliness of the bed and watched TV as my girlfriend showered. When she was done with the shower I heard a yell and jumped up to see what was wrong \u2013 the towel she grabbed had a dead bug stuck in the fibers of the towel. The bug was about the size of a housefly. I called management to again express my dissatisfaction. This was absolutely the worst experience I have ever had in a hotel \u2013 not to mention that the Casino and restaurants were not impressive at all. I already have a trip planned for Vegas not even 2 months since the aforementioned experience and I will not be stepping foot into this establishment and I highly recommend that anyone going to Vegas seek alternate lodging \u2013 there are plenty of places to stay in Vegas and a lot of great deals \u2013 Caesars is extremely overrated!!", "Date": "December 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Haywards Heath", "Title": "\u201cGet a room in the Augustus tower\u201d", "Author": "JumboMcNutt", "ReviewID": "UR50948319", "Content": "It appears reviews of this hotel vary depending on room type and the tower you get. Obviously conscious of this when I checked in (reserved a Deluxe room) I said my friend had not been to Vegas before and would appreciate a good view of the strip. As the check in girl had nothing in deluxe available that she thought was a \"great view of the strip\" she put us into a \"Luxury\" room in the newer Augustus tower - she even told us how much more that would have been if we paid for the Luxury room - but she gave it to us for no extra charge, which after we had got the room so cheap on getroomscheaper.com seemed even better. Now it wasn't particularly busy queue checking in at the time we did (about 5pm) but the Rodeo finals were on so they must have been close to capacity I would have thought. The room was excellent. Too large twin bed configuration, sofa, coffee table, dining table and a view looking down onto the Bellagio fountains and south strip. Paris, Planet Hollywood could both be seen as we were on the 42nd floor. It seems that if you ask you often get if you are polite and friendly. As the hotel is so big you can sometimes imagine that not everyone feels that it is a friendly place or that they cater to your needs but I failed to see that here. Before I have stayed at the Luxor, Excalibur, Green Valley Ranch, and apart from the later (which is nowhere near the strip) Caesars excels in service. The entertainment concierge booked us our golf, and gave us VIP passes to Pure Nightclub. Food options caters too all. 24hr cafe is fine for eating a quick bite at odd times. The food court just off the gaming floor is your typical fast food affair, although the options to vary from those you get in USA Malls as it was caesar's own brands. Pulled Pork, Tex/Mex, Asian, Pizza, Salad Bar. The Forum shops connected to the hotel offer your usual outlets for fashion. But the Cheesecake Factory restaurant in there has an extensive menu - and cheesecake is only one of a million things they do well, highly recommend you eat there if very hungry. The bars in Caesar's are ok, but some other hotel's have better. Pure Nightclub is one of the more popular clubs so get there early.

Stayed at Caesars palace during November 2009. First time in Vegas so when we arrived at the airport early evening -weary and tired - we spotted the Shuttle bus and got a return ticket (pickup on departure as well) for 28 dollars return. Our driver Jen was fabulous and after explaining we were here to see the Pro Bull Riders final at the Thomas & Mack center she said she was shuttling the Riders from Mandalay Bay to the event and if we needed a ride give her a shout. So we did! I though just as well to pay Jen as to pay a taxi and we met some fantastic people. Anyway back to Caesars - when we arrived I couldnt believe how grand it was. There was no check-in line. I walked straight up to the attendant who was most helpful. She asked for my Credit card number, just to keep on file, and I handed over our passports with a 20dollar note and asked if there were any comp upgrades. We were originally booked into a Forum Deluxe room however she gave us a room in the Augustus Tower - over-looking the Bellagio fountains! Incredible room - 2 Queen beds, table & chairs, sofa, large flat screen tv, massive walk-in shower, jacuzzi, his 'n hers sinks and of course the fantastic view. I dont know the layout of the other towers but the Augustus was very easy to find. Just off the front desk area. No need to walk through the casino and our room was literally 5 minutes from front entrance to our door. We did breakfast first morning at Caesars in Cafe Lago. Great breakfast - quite expensive but def the best we had. It was the only morning we didn't have a coupon to use other than that we had 2 for 1 and buy one get one half price. We also eat at Imperial Palace (twice), Mandalay Bay and Mirage. Lots of choice we didnt have a problem finding anything to eat. The buffet kept us going all day and we then found eveing meals - choice in abundance. The Outback Steakhouse is the best ever. As for trips we did the Grand Canyon Sunset Helicopter tour with Maverick - this was incredible - expensive but incredible. I booked the tour before I left the UK and paid when we arrived for the trip. I would not have missed this for the world. Maverick were brilliant - very professional. We were also in Vegas for the Pro Bull Riders Final at the Thomas & Mack center. Again a brilliant experience with amazing entertainment. We had the pleasure of travelling to the event with the professional riders. Originally we only had tickets for the Friday night however we purchased tickets to the final whilst we were there. We are so glad we did. The atmosphere was brilliant - we felt like true cowboys! Other than that with only 4 days in Vegas we only scratched the surface and crammed as much in a we could. When I attempted to ring the shuttle company to book our return journey my phone card would not accept the number so I went to the front desk and a more than helpful attendant rang the company and even booked it for me. Our 8.30am check-out was quick and smooth. Shuttle bus took us straight to the airport and dropped right outside our terminal doors. All in all we had a the most fantastic time. When I return I will probably do things slightly differently. The majority of hotels on the strip are all of a high standard and I think as long as you've got the central location i would stay anywhere and have equally as nice time. This is by no means any reflection on caesars - we absolutely loved the place - just next time I would spend a little less on the hotel room and a little more on the gambling!

First of all, the TV was a tiny 20\" Tube sitting in a cabinet that had to be at least 20 feet away from our bed due to the weird L shape of our room. There was no real closet in the room, the safe was awkwardly sitting on the floor in one corner looking like someone could just pick up the whole thing and walk away. Furthermore, one of the light bulbs in the recess lights right above our bed was missing and the entire socket appeared to be covered with what looked like mold. The bathroom was extremely old, with cracks on the vanity and mildew looking stains on the walls.... disgusting! The room was EXTREMELY NOISY. Every time one of our neighbors flushed the toilet, ran the sink, or took a shower, there was a sound of water running through the pipes that was so loud in our room, we couldn't hear each other talking. I'm not exaggerating, it was THAT loud. We only found the hair dryer on the last day when checking out. It was hidden a lower drawer below the TV. Why it would be there I have no idea.

The price was fair in my opinion for what i was SUPPOSED to get which was a room in the AUGUSTUS tower with 2 queen beds. The day before i was supposed to arrive i got an email stating that my flight would arrive 3hrs earlier than first projected, so i called caesars to ask if i coulf possibly check in early, \"shouldn't be a problem, happens all the time\", she said. So i arrived approx 1130 am thursday, and as im pulling in to the VALET there is a sign that reads \" VALET FULL. please self park\". So as im about to backup and find the \"self park\" a parking employee informs me that \"if your checking in that valet should not be a problem\", that they only put out that sign to \"detour locals, and non hotel guests\". So i proceed to the valet, where i promptly let them know im checking in. Once inside i proceed to the hotel guest check-in. Upon arriving to the line im met by a CP employee who is telling everyone that \"early check-in doesnt start until 1pm\", so i tell her that ive already contacted the hotel and they know i will be arriving early. She wants none of it! Tells me to go check my bags at bell station and to come back at 1. So i proceed to walk about 50ft away to some sofas and wait. About 15mins later she disappears so i take the opportunity to jump in the line.. What do you know they have some rooms available!! Gee imagine that! The man at the desk informs me \"im upgrading your room for free\".. Ok now im starting to forget about everything and warm-up to this place. After informing me that they would charge an additional $200 on my debit card for \"incidentals\", he informs me that im staying in the PALACE TOWER room 1038. COOL. So instead of walking 50 feet to the AUGUSTUS tower elevators i walk about 300yds to the PALACE tower elevators which are in no-mans land it seems. Im located on the 10th floor. I open the door, and to my displeasure im greeted by 1 KING bed (i had booked 2 Queens). Now if i wasnt staying with my 55yr old mother, i wouldnt have been to pissed. But being that im not 11yrs old anymore, sleeping with your mother is alittle weird in my book. So i call to the front desk and ask for someone to talk to.. They transfer me to call HOUSEKEEPING. I talked to someone and they inform me that a ROLL-AWAY bed will be an extra $30 dollars! So i agree, and within 30mins a man knocked on the door with the bed. About 730-8pm we arrive back at CP from having a wonderful Thanksgiving dinner at \"The Tillerman\" steakhouse on flamingo rd, only to be told that since we arent \"checking in\" that we would have to self park. We explained that we were guests of the hotel and that we had valet'd earlier without problem. After getting serious additude from the valet kid (string bean white kid) we talked to a \"manager\" that told string bean to park our car. So at CHECK-OUT the next morning i explained my situation to the clerk, and she managed to adjust the $30 roll-away charge OFF my room's bill.

Earlier this year we decided that for my dad\u2019s 60th we would all go on a trip to Las Vegas. This trip was to spend quality family time and to have a whole lot of fun. We looked up and down the strip, checked websites, read blogs and there were pros and cons to every hotel. Some are newer, some have particular features, but in terms of location, amenities and what the hotels have to offer for entertainment and dining, we selected Caesars Palace. Having spent some time trying to organise the trip from the UK, making transatlantic phone calls and surfing a host of websites trying to book, I was introduced to Harrah\u2019s Total Experiences programme where we had a dedicated member of staff to assist in organising our trip. Prior to departure we worked jointly to plan an itinerary, and when we arrived everything was sorted and reserved- we were put in a good room, no cheeky $20 at the desk! As a group of four we all had different plans in what we wanted to do during the day. Timothy played poker tournaments, Orry and Robin took advantage of the golf courses and the perfect sunshine and being centrally located, I could wonder about, do some shopping and admire the other hotels the strip. We could enjoy ourselves safe in the knowledge that tickets were booked for the best seats, reservations were made in the best restaurants and no time was wasted, as we skipped every queue to sit in the best VIP areas of nightclubs and not just in the Harrah's properties. We were treated like royalty, and I am sure people were asking, \u201cwho are these guys with the best seats in the house?\u201d but I was not totally surprised, as we look a bit like a boy band as you can see in the photos! There were so many highlights in the 6 days, but it would be remiss not to mention a couple of special things. \u2022 The Qua Spa at Caesars is among the best in the world. I was so relaxed, I didn\u2019t want to leave. Planned to go once, went 3 times and worth every penny. Wish I discovered it earlier in the trip. \u2022 The cooking at Bradley Ogden was great. Some restaurants have more Michelin Stars, but this is proper cooking for proper people, with the best service in Vegas. We went to Robuchon at MGM, and although French Cuisine is great, you can get it in London (or indeed France!) \u2022 It was a dream come true for my dad to meet Bette Midler and get his photo taken with her. Her show was a medley of songs, jokes, stories and dancing and only possible in Vegas. Three weeks later and the photo with Bette has replaced my mother\u2019s picture on his office desk! \u2022 I have a soft spot for old Las Vegas and the \u201cneon flashin\u2019 and one arm bandits crashin\u2019\u201d, so taking a wonder down Fremont Street ignited a feeling of nostalgia of a bygone era. Would recommend it to all travellers! \u2022 On previous visits to Las Vegas, we just couldn\u2019t get into Pure and other nightclubs being a group of guys. As we booked with Total Experiences, Harrah's arranged for us to be VIPs, dancing and singing with Shaggy on stage, cool! \u2022 Having dinner at Paris in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower and with the backdrop of the Bellagio Fountains was a perfect way to spend our last night. So that\u2019s it. As Robin said, \u201cDefinitely the best holiday I have ever been on and probably the most fun week I have ever had.\u201d i would recommend the hotel, but moreover recommend booking through the Total Experiences programme if you are a group planning a trip, or a stag or a golf break, as they just sorted access and everything we needed on the trip for us, including nightclubs, golf etc. Having organised stag trips from London to Vegas before, I know what a chore it is. They have a website- google, harrah's total experiences or if you are in the UK send me a message and i'll pass on details to Dani who organised our trip (probably not best to pass on personal details on an open forum!!!)

Around 1:00 went back to see if we could check in and was able to. We were comped a room in the Augustus tower. Very nice room, large and clean. Right away, we tried to store my purse in the safe and it was not working, so we called and someone came up to fix it. The tech said it was working and left. Again, when we tried to lock up my purse it was doing the same thing, so I just decided I would keep my purse with me. The beds were a little uncomfortable (felt like either really cheap mattresses or mattresses that needed to be replaced) The bed pillows were worn out too. The overhead light in the bathroom did not work and the first night, the jacuzzi tub would not work (but it did the second night-so it may have been something I was doing wrong to try to get it on). One evening we tried to rent a movie and had trouble getting that to start, so called the desk twice and they said they would reset something and they did and the movie did start after that. These are my only complaints about the room. Other than that, we were comfortable in the room, it was quiet, never heard any noise. Ordered room service for breakfast both mornings, took 45 minutes to an hour to arrive, but they told us that when he placed the order. It was a little on the high side, but was worth the convenience. Food was good and plentiful. Ate in the Augustus Cafe for dinner one evening, food was good. We also ate at the food court for lunch one afternoon. It was good there also. Everyone on this site has been complaining about the prices of food, but my opinion is when you stay at a higher end hotel, you really need to expect the food will cost a little more. By the time we left, we had enough comp points to cover the extra costs we incurred. Although I enjoyed the hotel, I do not know if I would stay there again. I was really disappointed with the casino, so many older machines that are literally worn out. We like to play bar poker and was not comfortable at any of the bars. The casino has a lot of wasted space, could fit in many more machines, maybe some new ones. We played bar poker at the Venetian as well as Bellagio, had much more fun there, the bars were quieter and not as brightly lit up. We like to choose a hotel that we can come back to in the evening and spend a few hours gambling there and then only have to walk a short way to our room. Although I had walked through that casino before and probably played a little along the way, I guess I never really paid too much attention to the condition and state of their machines. For that reason, I will probably stay somewhere that we can enjoy the casino more.", "Date": "November 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "usa", "Title": "\u201cIt is Vegas, but when it comes to customer service don't take your chances.\u201d", "Author": "goblue56", "ReviewID": "UR48949237", "Content": "I recently stayed at Caesars Palace and was quite disappointed in my choice. I had believed that this hotel could be mentioned with the better names in the area, but did not find it to meet my expectations. I had decided to give the hotel a shot when I saw a promotion that was being run over Halloween weekend on Twitter. It sounded like it would be a fun time and what put me over the top was when I saw that the first people to sign up for the promotion would have their room upgraded. I was worried about my upgrade so I sent a tweet to make sure this upgrade was still available (was I in that first X number of people to sign up). They said yes. I still didn't trust it, so to confirm I contacted the hotel through their website as well. When I went to check-in the clerk saw there was a note that I had asked about this upgrade...however, they told me this room was no longer available. I was disappointed and hoping they would care enough to make this up to me in some way. They didn't. I was thinking about staying an additional night beyond what I had reserved, so I asked them if they could do anything for me in this area (the list price for the room for this extra night which was a Sunday was $250- in comparison I knew I could get a room at the Bellagio for that night at $118, so I figured there might be some room to work). No luck. I headed up to my room. It looked ok- nothing special- not terrible, but not worth the price I paid. I checked out the bed- not that comfortable. Later I went to take a shower- handle is broken so it doesn't stay at the hot water side of things. Ok, so I'm stuck with a bad room- maybe it could at least be clean? Housekeeping comes by- my friend is in the bathroom, can you come back in 10 minutes? Ok. We leave. Back in 6 hours...still dirty. So we've stayed two nights, want a third, but there's no deal so we're off to the Bellagio. Time to check out. The clerk asks how the stay was, but obviously doesn't care. I started to say 'actually it wasn't very good...'- but he wasn't really interested. I continued to explain what had happened with the room at check-in...yeah, whatever, you have a $3 balance- shall I put that on your credit card? So that last part kinda sums it up for me. Will everything go right on every stay? No. But what's the attitude when it doesn't? We couldn't wait to get out of there and so we left the hotel at 8am on Sunday and went to the Bellagio. We knew it was very early but asked if we could check in. The clerk said 'I don't think we can do that for someone who is only staying one night'...before laughing and finding us a room. We may have been lucky that there was something available, but from the friendly service I knew they would do their best to take care of us.

Yes, there's an awful fountain of naked muses in the lobby right when you enter, and there are similarly bad imitations of Classical sculpture everywhere in the hotel, but it's Vegas, so that's to be expected! I was there for a conference and my employer had already pre booked everything. The check in staff were very pleasant and offered a tempting upgrade to a better room for a mere $30 a day. I waffled, then agreed to the offer. When I got to my room, I was stunned--what a great bargain! It wasn't the largest room in the world, but it was around 500 sq. ft, VERY ample space. The decor did not make my eyes hurt. The bathroom was huge and had a TV as well as a jacuzzi tub. And it only came for $30 more! I slept very well--it was quiet and the air smelled clear (rare in Vegas). The conference center was also a pleasant surprise. Very well appointed and large. It was hard to get to from my rooms though. And it was so big I got lost. The casino was average--seemed a bit empty, but the economy had just tanked when I was there (October 2008). The one restaurant we went to, Rao's was good but pricey. I think they were trying to capitalize on their reputation as one of the hardest restaurants to book in New York. I'm still very much an MGM Grand fan when it comes to restaurants, though. Maybe I am limited, but it just seems easier and more dependable, since they've managed to amass just about every noteworthy chef on the face of the earth over there.

When we arrived at 7:30 Pm I was told that our room was not ready yet. We then decided to go to the Diamond lounge and get a drink and something to eat because we were starving with the long flight from Phila. After going back to check on our room they said it would be another 1/2 hour, so we went to look around the hotel. The hotel is huge and has allot to see. we wanted to get aquainted with our surroundings since we heard is was difficult to navigate. In reading past reviews we were a liitle bit nervous with our room. We finally got our key's and went up to our room to be very happy. We were in the Augustus tower room 3370. It was right near the elevator and had a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains outside our window, The rooms are like mimi suites. very large, has a couch and a few chairs, and the bathroom was awsome. Had a juccuzi tub, shower and TV in the bathroom so when you are taking a bath you can watch TV. rooms were very clean. As for the prices of food, come on give me a break!! I am by no means a cheap person, but $17.00 for a cheeseburger at the Cafe is crazy. Needless to say we ate elsewhere.As for the pool the way they designed the two newer towers is rediculous. You don't get any sun at all at the pool until 12:30 Pm. I sat at the pool for over 3 hours waitiing, and waiting, and waiting. They don't have enough chairs either. If you get down there in the afternoon to go to the pool, good luck trying to find a lounge chair. and oh by the way the drink prices are crazy too. $14.00 for a small drink and $22.00 for a large. That's why I brought a few beers in a small bag with ice to the pool. The sports book is huge and had allot of fun there. If you play keno they give you free drink coupons which came in handy considering the prices of drinks. All in all it was a great place to stay, very clean and comfortable.We were celebrating our anniversary and had a great time.

We have been to Vegas several times before and decided to stay at Caesar's because we never had and wanted to experience the kitsch. :) (like Disneyworld for adults) The place is very impressive and more to see than we had time for-and unbelievably HUGE! I knew not to take my \"pretty\" shoes,but rather the walking shoes-good thing,too! From our room in the Palace Tower to the Flamingo,across the street was about a mile hike. Our room was large,lovely and comfortable. Beware the weight-sensitive mini-bar and amenties on top of the bar they want you to buy. $8 m&m's,seriously! With this type of luxury place you don't get a coffee pot,micro or fridge (that's dedicated to the mini-bar). My dear hubby hiked down to Payard's each morning and got me a $6 cup of coffee. Everyone was friendly except for the dealers who seemed not to like their jobs. Hubby plays craps and there was never anything but $25 tables. I never saw them busy or noticed anybody winning at anything,actually. We went across the street to the Flamingo to gamble where it was much more exciting with $5 and $10 tables. The craps crew at the F were surprized when we told them about the (mostly empty) $25 tables at Caesar's! They are both owned by Harrahs,I understand. We also went downtown to gamble and hubby won big at his favorite-Binion's. We had brunch at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill (at Caesar's) and it was good-not as good as last time's meal at Wolfgang Puck's Bistro,tho'(at the MGM). All food we encountered at C's was very expensive. We were seated at Beijing Noodle #9 for dinner and after about 10 minutes with no service at all got up and left-they never even noticed. At the Seafood restaurant we were warmly welcomed and had great service and good food,tho' it is more Asian than seafood. Another meal was at a diner type place at the Flamingo-we were ready for a burger and it was good. We had dinner at Caesar's Augustus Cafe one night. As far as I know,it is the only 24-hr place to eat at C's. It was not very good with fair to poor service. Notes: It is very dry in Vegas,I couldn't moisturize enough,or get enough to drink. A 16 oz. (I think) soft drink at the shop in the lobby is $3.95. I tried to buy soda out of the machines on 2 floors-neither worked. Could they be trying to force you to buy those $6 drinks from the mini-bar? We rented a car because we went to Hoover Dam one day. Driving on the Strip is horrible-take a taxi or limo if you can. It took forever to get our car from the airport rental place and make it to the hotel.", "Date": "October 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cSurreal experience\u201d", "Author": "marks46", "ReviewID": "UR46721225", "Content": "It took me a long time to understand this whole 'Vegas Experience' , but it was certainly not what I expected.

I expected high rollers, tuxedo's, show's starring Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, that sense of a real piece of American history, that I as a European had not experienced before. At first I was bitterly disapointed in Vegas, there was no glamour, this really is a Kitsch city, and caesars the most kitsch hotel I have ever stayed in. The mental picture of glamour was instantly replaced by poor Mexican's handing out leaflets advertising porn and adult services, the tuxedo's relaced by baseball caps and shorts, The million dollar gambling tables replaced by 1000's of 25 cent slot machines. The beutiful people replaced by average americans with their large cups full of quarters. Then I got it, Las Vegas is not meant to be glamour, it is meant to be kitsch, infact it is meant to be the absolute pinnicle of kitsch, and you know what Caesars delivers it perfectly. Caesars and Vegas delivers a completely different experience to anywhere else in the world, complete with talking statues. You can see why this place is so popular with ordinary people, stag and hen parties, and the bemused foreigner, it provides a totally different experience based on excess, and fantasy. The rooms were fine, quite ordinary compared wit the rest of the hotel, and the service completely corporate and delivered to perfection. With the strength of the Euro against the Dollar, I found it to be reasonably priced, and we ate well in the various restaurants.

The rooms were ungodly expensive, even pricey after dividing the price by 3 since I shared a room with two friends. Still, I must say the rooms were incredibly impressive and worth every penny. Extremely spacious and elegantly decorated. The bathroom itself was nearly as big as my bedroom at home, and had an enormous jetted tub, walk in shower, vanity with two sinks and a separate closet for the toilet. It was one of the the best hotel rooms I've ever stayed in, though the mattresses could have been a little softer. That said, from what I saw of a regular base level room (which they call Classic), I can't imagine that it'd be worth staying in this hotel if you weren't splurging on one of the more expensive rooms. The base level rooms weren't much better than a room at any run of the mill chain hotel yet are rented at rates higher than much of the strip. Caesars has one of the greatest locations of any of the resorts on the strip. Right in the middle of everything so walking to other resorts isn't as arduous as it could be. And that's if you even decide to leave the resort. Caesars has some of the best shopping in the area, the Forum Shops is easily my favorite shopping center on the strip. Lots of great restaurants are here, the spa is absolutely fabulous (even just paying the $45 to use the facilities at Qua is worth it, though for that much you ought to just get a treatment as their staff is wonderful), the pools are gorgeous and their show rooms host plenty of big name entertainers. It'd be very easy to check in here for a long weekend and never find a reason to leave the property. All and all, I'd have to say this is an excellent resort, though probably out of the price range of many travelers (myself included) as there are plenty of hotels nearby that offer rooms that are just as nice (or in the case of base level rooms, much better) for less.

My room's location had great day and night views!!! of the Bellagio and the Fountain Show, Bally's, Paris' Eiffel Tower and their Balloon/Globe, Planet Hollywood, the newly almost completed City Center, and a distant view of the MGM Grand. My room had a King Bed, brown-velvet sofa with coffee table, a comfortable chair with ottoman, 36\" diameter wood table with 2 chairs, desk with chair, 2 LCD TVs (one in room and other in bath), 3 1/2' x 7' gold-framed mirror, 6' Wooden storage base with Refreshment Bar, a 10' x 14' well-appointed marble bath with coffiered ceiling, jetted? soaking tub, separate 3' x 4' glass-enclosed shower, a separate commode are with door, 6' Granite top Vanity with double sinks along with Twin Mirrors with 3 light Sconzes and many towel racks. After getting to my room, I noticed there was not a mini-fridge in the room. Before I called downstairs, the front-desk person who checked me in called my room phone to ask if I liked my room. I said everything was perfect, except I noticed there is no mini-fridge and I like to have one in a room. She immediately had one sent up to my room which was delivered (to my surprise) within 10 minutes after our phone conversation. Now that is what I call Great and Considerate Service! Housekeeping services appeared sufficient; always had fresh towels. However after the first couple of nights I had to leave a note requesting more soap which was a first-time experience as a guest. Housekeeping then left in the bathroom a plastic bag filled with a bunch of soap...LOL...all I wanted was a couple new bars. Pool area was nice, but chaises are too close to one another. Advise you get there about 9:30 a.m. for a spot. This establishment's grounds and facilities are beautifully done and maintained in my opinion. Huge wide-open rotunda in Registration area with center statutes. Convenient front-entrance taxi/shuttle services...no walking to some far and obscure area. I can't comment on Caesars Palace's dining establishments. I dined at my favorites. For you younger folks, there are a number of nightclubs/bars at this establishment...very active especially over the weekend...which seemed monitored by security personnel. Slots are very tight with little or smaller payouts than other casinos within Las Vegas; plentiful table games open. I saw Cher at Caesars Colosseum; great show and costumes though I was a bit surprised it only lasted an hour and fifty minutes. I hoped it would go over two hours long. Otherwise, very well put together and highly recommended. If you get to the Palazzo/Venetian, see Jersey Boys (based on Franki Vali and the Four Seasons) if you haven't yet seen it. The show is based on their life story and includes all their songs. However, see this show when Rick Faugno is performing (Friday's and Saturday's) as Franki Vali because his voice is much more spectacular (his vocals stand out more) than the other performer's voice. I really enjoyed my vacation stay here at Caesars Palace.

There were several reviews saying how grubby and run down it was???? Not our experience - on arrival I asked for a complimentary upgrade and they said one had already been applied. The room was lovely, clean, modern and although our view was of the back of the hotel, it was still a view. We stayed in the palace tower and paid about \u00a3350 for 3 nights through a travel agents. The hotel has a really nice vibe, people are very friendly and it went on for miles! Being a bit of a self proclaimed snob, I found that being one of the pricier hotels attracted better clientel. After looking round the other hotels, I would suggest Caesars, The Venetian and The Bellagio. Drinks are really expensive at about $9 each, so make sure you make the best of free drinks when gambling. Places to visit - Caesars Palace - The cheesecake factory. Either eat a main or dessert, nnot sure you will manage both! The Venetian - The Gondola rides. Very expensive and short but worth a look at the indoor canals, beautiful! The Mirage - All you can eat champagne breakfast. Not posh but fab food and we didn't need to eat until 11pm that night! The exploding volcano, outside and explodes every hour from 8-12. The Parisian - Mon Ami Gabi. The best breakfast I have ever had, great service and bottomless drinks. I had the chocolate and bacon waffle which stunned me into silence, a real must-try. The MGM - Free lion attraction, great for kids and big kids alike. KA the show, pretty expensive but mind blowing and had us gasping for breath at the stunts. The Stratasphere - The rides at the top are great, do them in the dark for best effect. We also had dinner at the 'Top of the World ' restaurant. Great views, good service but really pricey. $300 for 4 of us for just mains and a bottle of wine. Try it as a treat if you dont go on a helicopter. The Bellagio - The fountain goes off through the day, but come alive at night! They go off every 15 mins and are fabulous, another freebie! The dress code in here was a bit more upmarket and most girls were in dresses. One last top tip - the taxi from the airport to caesars cost us $30 on the way to the hotel and $11 on our trip back.... done over as usual for being a tourist. Ask for the direct route and say that you have been before so they dont con you. p.s. everyone wants a tip and some will ask you for one. Dont be a woss and pay a taxi driver if he doesnt do a good job, we had one who wouldn't accept our payment until we added a tip - tell them where to go, you wont see them again!

We were very excited to stay here, especially since the movie \"The Hangover\" and had just come out. Needless to say, the movie makes the hotel look a hell of a lot nicer than it is. Don't get me wrong, the lobby is pristine, the pool is immaculate and the forum shops are of course amazing. We spent almost every night dining at some of the fantastic restaurants in the forum shops, like Il Mulino, Boa Steakhouse, Sushi Roku and Spago. If not for the forum shops we would have been very disappointed. Our room was old and not kept well. It was a standard suite, and had a great view of the pool, but the bed was uncomfortable and had an old pink comforter like a motel. The bathroom was all marble and beautiful, except for one major problem---there was no door!!! Thankfully my boyfriend and I have been together long enough for this not to be a deal-breaker, but we were still uncomfortable with using the facilities with the other person in the same room and no door. Also, one afternoon water started pouring out of the ceiling vent above our toilet. We called down immediately and maintainence told us that it was from the room upstairs' tub overflowing. Obviously there was nothing they could have done to prevent this, but it still left a bad taste in our mouths. The spa there was amazing. It had several roman baths and jacuzzi's, and even had an arctic room which is set at 55 degrees and has fake snow! It was incredibly beautiful and relaxing. We were expecting a lot more from Caesar's Palace and unfortunately our expectations weren't met. The first night we arrived there was a group of housekeeping carts being stored on our floor right by our room. We called down to let them know and they said they would move them. The same thing happened the second night, only the carts were never moved. This happened every night of our 5 night stay and we complained several times. The casino was old and dreary. All of the dealers looked as if they had one foot in the grave (or wished they did) and the whole set up was very cheesy. The forum shops casino, however, was beautiful. The regular caesar's casino had very low ceilings and not a lot of things to do. The location of Caesar's was great--it's right in the middle of everything. But for the location, the Bellagio right next door was ten times as nice. My dad and his girlfriend were staying there and we wanted to be there all the time. The casino was beautiful and huge, the restaurants were yummy and trendy and it even had a better nightlife than Caesar's. We also visited the famous club Pure at Caesar's but it was not much to look at. It was extremely crowded and filled with really pretentious people. We are from Boca Raton, FL which is arguably one of the snobbiest places in the country, so we are definitely familiar with this crowd, but still had a hard time stomaching the one in Pure. Wouldn't recommend it but it was great for the awesome $90/night rate that we got.

A good view and the room was very nice with a large bathroom. The best thing about Caesar's Palace is that it is in a great location, right in the middle of the strip.

We like the casino and the large sports book at Caesar's. We're in our 30's and Caesar's has done a great job of infusing youth with their clubs with the older generation that has been coming back since the 1970's. It was packed from when we got there on Thursday to when we left on Sunday night. The pool area is very nice and the pools were heated even though it was over 100 degrees outside, which we liked. We were able to stay cool by the pool since half of the pool area spends most of the day in the shade, which has its pluses and minuses. It was impossible for 4 of us to find spots in the sun but we were able to stay cooler in the shade and hand out in the sunny side of a few of the pools. We bought a few rounds of beers at the store right by the entrance of the pool area instead of from the waitresses to save some money and make sure we didn't have to wait too long for the next round of drinks.

Also, Slots of Fun has upgraded their slots, this was one of the few places left that actually still used coins - now it's paper just like the rest. It was kind of sad to see all of the old machines gone. The slot tournament at Caesars was very nice (over 1,100 players).

The Pure nightclub is pretty cool and free if you are a guest but there was no where to sit if you are not in a VIP area so can get really tiresome if you have to stand all night.

Two bloody Mary's there.....Drunk again............. Back to bed and up at 4:30 to head to Excalibur for the Tournament of kings show(which was okay). We headed downtown that night and had a pretty good time. While visiting the pool at Caesars(which I figured would be one of the more enjoyable things to do there) I was pretty disappointed. I could hear this pounding base music from the bar close by which sort of over-rided the relaxing pool music we were supposed to be hearing. I just couldn't relax and ended up going across the street to get our show tickets for that day at tix for tonight.(Legends in concert 2for1 and George Wallace) Both shows were pretty good. When I got back to the pool my wife wasn't very happy because of the distracting sounds from over yonder. (Base from bar and construction). We headed out for a nice lunch. The room we had reserved was the Forum Tower Deluxe but when she found out we were Diamond Club members she automatically upgraded us to the Augustus Tower which is very close to the Diamond Lounge. I was really expecting something special because I had heard that the Forum tower rooms were quite good and the Augustus tower is a lot more expensive. My wife was very happy with the room and I have to admit I was pleased as well. I remember the shower havig multiple shower heads and there was a jucuzzi tub as well. Lots of stone and marble. Great TV. We could see the Bellagio Fountains (or at least the top of them) as our window was facing south. I just enjoyed looking outside to sort of get a feel for what was going on out there. We could see the busy Flamingo/Las Vegas Strip corner and all the people walking around. I don't want to stay at this place again as I prefer to come down the elevator and be able to walk right into a casino or go right out to the street without having a stroke. Next time it's back to the Flamingo for a little less luxury and a lot less wandering through seemingly endless walkways, entrances and rooms. Also for a tip. I'm pretty careful not to lose money on the slots, but at Caesars and Paris its almost impossible not to. Didn't eat at any of the restaurants.

I Have stayed at all the major 5* hotels on the strip like Venetian, Wynn, MGM, ect. I booked the room directly from the hotels website with a special room rate code I found on the internet. upon checkin, which was about 11pm there was a short line. The clerk at the desk gave us a corner room which is located at the end of every corridor, the corner rooms are much bigger then a normal room and i would defiantly recommend asking for this room when you checkin. The rooms are nice and big with a huge bath tub. I would say rooms are just nice and they don\u2019t have the WOW factor like the rooms at the Wynn. I was happy with the rate I paid for the room, but had I paid normal Caesars rates i would of been a bit disappointed. The Casino is big and a bit hard to navigate at first as you find your self going round in circles. The slots in Caesars are probably the tightest i have played and you\u2019ll find your $20 gone in about 2-3 mins. As for the food, make sure you try the serendipity3 restaurant which is located just outside Caesars, the food is amazing and the deserts are even better. make sure you ask to sit outside and enjoy your food while sitting in the middle of the vegas strip. As for the restaurants in the hotel, we tried the Augustus cafe for breakfast and was not very impressed. The pool area is also just OK and also a bit outdated, they are currently in the process of building a new pool which should be opening soon, even though their is construction pool side, you wont notice it. Make sure you take ID with you to the pool as you cant order anything on the room without it. All in all, I enjoyed my stay at Caesars and would recommend staying here if you get a good room rate.

We don't gamble much, just a few $ on the slotties, so we never get comps or anything, so I am commenting on the hotel as a tourist rather than on the casino etc. We stayed for 4 nights, having got the 4th night free through our booking with the UK travel company. The really pleasant guy on the check-in said he would upgrade us to the Palace tower, and our room was lovely. On the 15th floor, with a partial Strip view, very spacious, and a huge bathroom with a double Jacuzzi. It was bright and spotlessly clean. As usual, the mini-bar was extortionately priced, but this is the same the world over, and there was a large ice-bucket and plentiful ice available to chill your own wine that you've bought from the store for a few dollars. Coffee making facilities would have been nice, but that's my only very small niggle about the room. The lifts (elevators) were almost instantaneous despite being on floor 15, and all of the public areas were clean and well maintained. The concierge was very helpful when we wanted to book a show but there was a long queue as there was only one lady on the desk. We didn't eat in the hotel apart from by the pool one day, and although expensive, the portions were huge and very tasty; I had a mozzarella salad which was enormous and covered both my lunch and, as we English say, high tea ;-). Again, the drinks around the pool are way over-priced with two small tins of Corona beer coming in at around $15 plus tip! My only complaint about Caesars is the pool area. The pools themselves are lovely but if you don't get there early in the morning, 9.00am latest, you will struggle to get a sunbed. There is work going on at the moment which probably adds to the problem. Because of the high rise buildings around the pool, some beds are in the shade most of the day whilst others are in the sun with no shade at all; there were no parasols available or any tree cover, unless you paid the ridiculous sum of $250+ per day for a gazebo with sunbeds inside. Don't be fooled by the poster in the pool lobby which says these start from $25 per half-day. That probably means between the hours of 01.00am and 07.00am in January... Slight niggles aside, we loved Caesars. It is absolutely centre-strip which makes a real difference as you can do a hell of a lot of walking!

My sister and brother-in-law joined us and we all had a great stay at Caesars. Many thanks to the reviews suggesting you inquire about the \"complimentary upgrades\" upon check-in. We reserved and paid for a Classic room and took our chances that we'd be upgraded. I folded up a $20 bill and held it in from of my id while checking in and asked if there were any complimentary upgrades available. I saw the lady glance at it and she said \"Let me check.\" She was able to find us a suite in the Palace Tower and told me I really didn't have to tip her when I handed her the $20 (of course I did anyway.) She was very nice and professional about it. My brother-in-law planned on doing the same thing when he checked in, but forgot to use the word \"complimentary.\" Instead, he was offered an upgrade to a 4000 sq. ft. suite (compared to our 2000 sq. ft. suite) in the new Augustus Tower. I think he paid around $160 total, which included 2 nights. They told him it was normally $200+ per night to upgrade, so it sounds like he got a good deal too. We reserved a smoking room and were very pleased with everything. The room was clean, very nicely decorated (see attached pics, I love blue & brown) and stocked with plenty of towels, etc. I did notice the next morning when I woke up that the room smelled like an ashtray, which was weird because it hadn't before. Then after the maid cleaned that day the smell was gone, so they must have a very powerful deoderizer. We were in the Palace Tower, Room 1742 and had a view of the pools, which open at 8:00. We went out right after 8:00 and had no problems with chairs. We only stayed 1 hour so I don't know exactly when it got crowded, but when I looked down around 3:00 or 4:00 I only saw 1 or 2 open chairs and they were not together. We ate breakfast at the buffet and it was great. Some people say there's not a large selection, but I'm not sure what you could want for breakfast that they didn't have... eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits & gravy, muffins & other pastries, french toast, pancakes, cheese, fruit, etc. It was $18.95 if I remember correctly (definitely under $20) and worth it. We booked through Expedia and received a $50 food & beverage credit that could be used at any Caesars restaurant or bar, so our breakfast was \"free.\" We tried the buffet at Terrible's for lunch and it was good enough. Pretty decent for what it costs - I think only $7 pp. We ate dinner at Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab in the Forum Shops mall and it was really good. Prices you can expect for a nicer Vegas restauraunt (anywhere from $30-$50 per plate plus extra for sides, salads, everything.) All in all, we had a great time in Vegas. Next time I'll want to stay at least one more night. We arrived late Wednesday and had to leave early Friday so we really only had 1 full day. The staff at Caesars were all very friendly and helpful in our experience. I would definitely stay here again if the price were right, but there are other places on the strip I'd want to try out too (Bellagio for one.) Make sure to catch at least one Bellagio fountain show. I think they run every fifteen minutes at night and they're really neat. P.S. I can't speak much for the gambling at Caesars b/c I only played the slots there, and did no good.

This suite was based on the fictional one in the movie \"Rain Man\". Per the Las Vegas Sun, the suite in \"The Hangover\" was also partly based on this room. It's on the 69th floor (top floor) of the Forum Tower. The suite is bi-level, and has up to 4 bedrooms (if you use the connecting neighboring rooms). We used one of the connecting rooms, so we had 3 bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms. The living room is huge. It has a circular sofa on both sides, and a 52\" HDTV in the middle of the room that revolves 360 degrees. There is a great 2-story view of the Strip. There are speakers built into the ceilings and walls on both floors, and you can attach your IPod and blast your music through-out the entire suite. The TV also has access to both DirecTV and Dish Network, and there's also a Blu-Ray player in the room. There is a fancy remote that controls all the lighting (different moods), and the curtains. The suite also has a dining table and kitchen area. The bedrooms on the top level are huge, and have luxurious bathrooms. There are even TVs built into the bathroom mirrors. Because you need to be able to watch SportsCenter while you are shaving. The Suite is just awesome. We got numerous comments from other riders when we hit the 69 button on the elevator. One girl even jokingly accused me of trying to impress her by hitting that button. A few other people asked us for tours. The list rate on the room is $6,400 a night but you can easily get it for much cheaper if you gamble a lot. This room is ideal for a bachelor party, as you can easily fit up to 20 people in the Suite.", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ontario canada", "Title": "\u201cWonderful!\u201d", "Author": "hszumowski", "ReviewID": "UR38808478", "Content": "If you like hanging by the pool, shopping at pricey shops, and great enterainment.

We booked w/ Sunwing Vacations and paid $650 CAD each. We booked the Classic Room (which is the older tower, and had heard pretty terrible reviews of it, mainly that it was rundown and such) so we were pretty worried. We arrived at the hotel at 10am and left our bags w/ the bell desk. We returned at 1pm to check-in and were offered a free upgrade by the front desk. We got upgraded to a Palace Tower room \u2013 which is the tower closest to the pool entrance. We heard from people we met that they were not offered a free upgrade, in some cases even after offering a tip to the front desk. Seems to be hit or miss w/ the front desk, or perhaps it depends on your attitude when you get up there! The room was spacious, beds comfy, flat screen tv. Jacuzzi tub in the bathroom, double sinks, separate shower. There was a separate vanity area outside the bathroom as well. Bathrobes are provided in the closet, and extra towels and bathrobes were brought up promptly both times that we called for them during our stay. Maid service was so-so. It appeared that our bathroom floor was not mopped daily. We were not picky about this. The beds were made up nicely and the towels refreshed daily. The complex itself is pretty massive. The walk from the room to the strip was about 10 minutes. In terms of restaurants, we ate at Noodle 9 \u2013 it was fairly priced but the food not the greatest. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. There is a food court between the casino and the Forum Shops \u2013 you could get good food for reasonable prices, and not have to go to a sit down restaurant. Highly recommend the burger place as the food is fresh and delicious! The pool at CP is very nice \u2013 you need to get out there before 11am in order to get lounge chairs for your group. And even so, this took some effort in moving lounge chairs around so that we could all sit together. By afternoon guests spread out on the deck wherever they can find space! The pool is great b/c it gets sun ALL day, vs other hotels where the sun might be blocked by the hotel during certain times.

Be prepared for LONG, LONG check-in lines. There is not enough staff nor self check-in options so you stand in a Disney type loop line for 20-30 mins just to check in. Our last trip was a year ago plus a few months to see Elton John. This time we came to see Bette. We stayed in the Augustus Tower last time and this time they wanted to upgrade us to a one bedroom suite in the Forum Tower. The Forum Tower has been complete redone and is very nice. However, if you are going to use the spa you have to walk through the casino for quite some time to reach it. It is in the Augustus Tower. The last thing you want after a great massage is a 20 min walk through a smokey casino. So book accordingly. Our room had last been inhabited by a bachlorette party and their balloons were still up in the room We found more behind the couch. Strange.Otherwise the room was large, clean and well kept during our stay. Caesars is convenient to the Flamingo, Harrahs, Imperial across the street as well as Ballys, Mirage, Treasure Island and the Bellagio. Nice little walkways and escalators whisk you to these other hotels. We like to eat and gamble at different places so we liked being able to go in a different direction and find new casinos. A number of these casinos are part of the Harrah's network so if you are a Total Rewards customer you get points at all of them. Let talk food: breakfast buffet was cold. Servers were very nice tho. The slice next door is expensive but great for a food court. We had hamburgers one day and pizza another and both were good. The Java Cafe is good for a quick breakfast, but again pricey. Better to go out to Serendipity which had several specials running while we were there including buy one margarita get the second one free. Serendipity is right out the front on the second level outside. The show was great Bette Midler stuff but I was disappointed in the audience. I had seen Bette 33 years ago at Caesars and that audience rocked. We were on the front row and we had four people next to us in shorts who kinda scowled during the whole show. Bette's busting her butt up there. Anyway, she was great and we went backstage afterward which was great fun. Rita Rudner was backstage waiting on Bette. I didn't recognize her as I am not a big comic fan, but my friend did. The gambling is good. Very professional dealers or you can go mechanical! There were booths where you could play 21 with an automated/televised dealer. That was fun. And there is a Rapid Roulette which gets rid of all the shoving at the tables. You have your own roulette table TV screen and about 40 seconds to place a min bet. That was fun too. The slots were tight BUT find the old machines and these pay out better. EVERYONE was playing penny slots. I don't get that. The casino was very very smokey and cocktail waitresses were overworked. They need to put on about 3 more in the evenings. The internet was expensive: $14.99 per day. With as much money as they are raking in downstairs you would think it would be free. Even though this trip was great, I would probably stay somewhere else next time. I am intrigued by the whole Fremont St. experience and the efforts hotels like the Golden Nugget are making to attract customers. So, might try that next time.

Maybe this is because some of the review makers have been only in few hotels and has not been travelling too much - or maybe the hotel rooms are all very different from each other, these are the only reasons I can think of. For my opinion, this hotel is a little worn out, and has certainly seen it\u00b4s best days. The public areas, as the lobby and the casino, have had their shining star times long ago. The carpets look old, and the service in front desk is poor. When we arrived the hotel (late at night) with our friends, we were asking to be located to the same floor (we both couples had forum tower de luxe rooms), but this could not be arrenged. Ok, I understand that in a big hotel full of guests this can be hard. But the thing really surprised me was that the clerk at the front desk gave us our keys and guided us to our rooms through the longest way - through the whole casino. He propably thought that we would be more anxious to come back down stairs to play in the casino, than if he would guided us to go via the shortest way to our rooms. I just found this irritating. By the way, no chance having the bell boy taking your luggage to your room- you have to do it your self...at least if you don\u00b4t have to change the rooms you were just given...then you can get the bell boy carry your suitcases, at least this was our experience. When we got to our room, I first discovered dirty towels on the floor. As I walked through the room, there were two dirty wine glasses and an empty bottle of wine, and other trash lying on floor, on the bed and on the table. Also the bed was obviously used. Disgusting. I called the front desk immediately to have an other room. And I had to call there 4 times before anything happened. We were waiting with our lugagge in the dirty room for 35 minutes before somebody came. With a long way back to the reception and with 3 big suitcases in the middle of the night, that was really the only option - to wait. After several hours travelling in the middle of the night, it didn\u00b4t feel nice at all. Well, the bell boy finally came, with new keys to our new room - in to a new floor again. He was terribly sorry, and really nice. He was shocked how we were given this dirty room, and said that this wasn\u00b4t the only time this sort of thing had happened. When we got to the new room, he checked it first, and let us in after looking that everything was OK in the room. He was really nice, and the only person that apologised for the inconvenience. The next day I went to the front desk to say that I found last night waiting and poor service from the front desk terrible, and were given free of charge for 30 dollars of the drinks from the minibar. OK, that\u00b4s fair enough, I thought. Well, that would been just too easy - as we cheked out later on, again an other clerk at the reception accused us to have been taken some nuts from the minibar, which I told was impossible, as myself and my spouse are terribly allergic to nuts! And yes, we had noticed that when you move or touch the minibar goods, they go wright away to your check, so we didn\u00b4t even touch anything else than the drinks that we were having (and the nuts were in a different place, not even in the fridge!)- free of charge up to the 30 dollars given. Well, finally they believed us, and said it\u00b4s OK. For me, this was just another experience of the poor service in this hotel. Our friends room was otherwise OK, except the smelling of cigarettes & tobaccos in their room. They have Forum Shops mall area in the hotel, which was nice and convenient. Also a lot of restaurants to choose from. Casino was average. The hotel is very good situated. We went elsewhere for breakfast, as having heard some bad reviews of the hotels own breakfast buffet, so we didn\u00b4t try that at all - so can\u00b4t comment on that one. Las Vegas was nice, and we might go back some day, but definitely to an other hotel. This is not a 5 star hotel. I would give it 3 stars, average.

Now I suppose if you're getting a king room you're probably going to be pretty intimate with your bedmate. But call me quaint. I like MY privacy in the bathroom and I know my wife well enough to know that she likes HER privacy in the bathroom too. We asked to be moved to a different room and they accomodated us to a room on the same floor with a bathroom door. Might be worth asking before you check in if this is important to you or if you're staying with someone you're not that close too. We paid about $130 a night, a rate that included a $50 dining credit in the hotel restaurants. I'm not going to choose to stay here again based on the sheer size of the place. Way, way too overwhelming for me. But again, I had absolutely no complaints other than tight slots and I stress my wife really liked the place. One big tip. You can access the parking garage from Frank Sinatra Way which runs parallel to the Las Vegas Strip. It's a huge timesaver coming in or out of the hotel. Enjoy your stay... and just ask about the bathroom door thing!", "Date": "August 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "south shields", "Title": "\u201cloved it\u201d", "Author": "aycarumba", "ReviewID": "UR36966674", "Content": "We moved to caesars after a couple of awful nights at Excalibur.

The bed wasn't the fancy pillowtop cushy mattress I usually find in a nice hotel, nor were the linens any nicer than what I have at home. The bathroom wasn't terribly nice. No fridge, coffeemaker or microwave. Put it like this: this room didn't make we want to hang out in it, which is my test of how nice a room is. As for the Caesar's Pool: I believe half of it is closed for construction because it seemed smaller than what I saw in pictures. They also blast music and you can hear some of the club music from the Venus pool so if you want a place to relax, forget it. Maybe they have the volume turned up to drown out the construction and the interstate that runs right behind the pool. Anyway, I went out there looking to relax and left after about an hour. If your room faces the pool (like mine at the 13th floor) you can hear the dim \"thump, thump\" from the pool music all day! Casino: I'm not a gambler but it was kinda smoky (I'm sure there's places worse and better on that mark) and it annoyed me that the layout of the ground floor had me dodging friggin slots anywhere I had to go.

My girl loves her coffee in the morning so this was a big inconvenience each morning. We enjoyed our first stay at CP but we won't go out of our way to stay there again. It takes forever to get around there or to get from your room to the strip. Check in was pretty quick and the staff there were very friendly. My room was comped but I don't think I would stay there again if I had to pay. We have stayed at just about all the Harrah's properties and while CP is beautiful, we enjoy ourselves just as much, if not more, at their other properties. The pool area is still under construction but we did enjoy our time spent by the pools. We stayed by the main pool most of the time and enjoyed it. We did not order any drinks due to the high prices and chose to drink just before or after going to the pool. We did not eat once at CP as they were so much more expensive than neighboring casinos and the reviews have not shown me that they are justified charging those higher prices. our Friends ate at Ogdens and spent about $400 on dinner. They said it was really good but not sure if they would ever do it again. Did not have any luck in the CP casino. So ventured off and hit just about every hotel on the strip the first two nights. We wound up hitting Slots of Fun two nights in a row. It was so much fun to be able to play with actual quarters or dollars on the slot machines so we hit there twice. There is something about that place that is fun. Circus Circus apparently took over ownership of Slots of fun on July 1st so I hope they keep things the same. It is nice to see that on the strip amongst all the giants that are there. We also ventured downtown for a day and had much more luck playing down town. Was disappointed to see the downtown mall is closed up. Looks like it had just closed in June as there were posters for the movie theatre of movies that came out this past June. I saw Dodge Ball there for the 1st time a few years ago with my kids on a past trip so I was bummed to see that it closed. After spending some time at the Golden Nugget, I think we may stay there next trip. Some times I really enjoy spending time downtown and they have the best pool area so that is next on my list.

I'd like to say that I absolutely one hundred and 10 percent loved our hotel and our room. First of all, the location is PRIME, it is on the mid - strip location, right next to the Bellagio and VERY close to Paris and Planet Hollywood, and on the other side, the Mirage... I think the location itself is ideal, as most other hotels lie south or north of the strip and can be a good walk to get to. I personally enjoyed Caesars decor and just the hotel itself better than the inside of the Bellagio and certain other ones, you tend to find that most look alike inside (casino areas, etc). We were fortunate enough to get upgraded to the Palace Tower, even though I had booked a Forum Tower, and I didn't even have to ask, she just implied that we had booked the Palace Tower (which is one of the newest towers). We arrived fairly late, at about 11:30 so there virtually was no line to check-in (during the day the line is pretty long... this is a big hotel, so it's expected). Furthermore, the room was amazing. Big king sized bed, the views of the pool (Palace Tower is right next to the pools) and the bathroom had a nice big sized jetted tub in it as well. Also, there is construction going on in the pool area, however, much to many complaints I have seen, I didn't think the construction bothered us at all, they play music and it kind of surpasses the construction noise, I thought. Also, it does get pretty full, we went right when they opened at 8:30 (it's GREAT at this time because you get to pick where to sit, ample options, and the heat isn't unbearable). The pool area was by far my favorite of the hotel, very classy and nice. Also, we had breakfast at Augustus' Cafe (about 36 total for 2 people) and it was probably the best breakfast I've ever had! (No joke) Taxis to and from the airport to this location on the strip are about $12-15, so not bad at all. All in all, this hotel far exceeded my expectations, and you'll LOVE it!!!

We were picked up by Presidential Limo (stretch). Very nice! Stopped at liquor store on way for supplies. Room: 5 Nights Comped at Forum Tower Deluxe (thanks to my Atlantic City Harrah's Play). Upon arrival at Caesar's, there had to be about 50 people in the check-in line....so the wait began. Finally, I \"tipped\" the check-in clerk $25 to get an upgrade from our Forum Tower Deluxe room to an Augustus Tower Deluxe Room (we had a great view of the Bellagio Fountains! Room 3782). We had a refrigerator brought up (free of charge) and unpacked. Walked around hotel a bit....ate some lunch at Augustus Cafe and had a very nice lunch (expensive, though). Gambling Highlights: Played mostly 3-card poker, VP, and Blackjack. Went up and down on the table games, although I did get three \"6's\" - the sign of the beast, which paid 30 to 1 on my $25 bet. Not too bad, but I ended up giving it back eventually. VP machines at Caesars were scarce, so I played at the VP Bar by the Sportsbook. They sure know how to pour drinks over there....I don't remember getting back to the room that night....and YES I LOST AGAIN! I did have fun and met some nice people. My husband played in a few poker tourneys, didn't win either. We have a curse with Harrah's properties, as we never win at any of them (even in Atlantic City). We are good with Boyd/MGM though. Went to Bellagio and won $250 within 5 minutes on a $.25 slot! Go figure! Food: Went to Bellagio Buffet. Had to have the giant Alaskan King Crab Legs and the Prime Rib. Excellent! We all got our money's worth that night for sure! Caesar's Food Court: Beware! Food isn't bad, but God forbid you want a slice of pepperoni pizza, you'll pay $6.50 for it! Or how about $4 for one bagel? Rao's: Inside Caesar's. Very nice meal - excellent food. It should be for $160.00 (without liquor)! Otherwise, ate at Caesar's Cafe Lago Buffet for breakfast only. I heard it sucked and it sure did. Awful - stay away. The eggs were runny, no selection, too expensive, etc. Mostly went to the Payard Pattisere coffee shop for breakfast sandwich/coffee. Ate at BLT Burger at Mirage one night - very good food and reasonably priced! Went to Joe's Prime Steak and Stone Crab on our last night (Fri.) for our 15th anniversary. Excellent steak and crab! Yes, you sure do pay for it, but the food/service is excellent. I think I saw a few celebrities there as well! POOL: The pool at Caesar's is still under construction. You don't hear the noise too much, as they play loud music. 2 main pools are open, but we pretty much stayed by the round main one. No, there was no styrofoam or dust or dirt from the construction in the pool at all. Get there before 9:00 for decent seats. It opens at 8:00 a.m. Tip: Don't order a beer at the pool - it's $8 for one, or $18 for a frozen drink. Ouch! We learned early and brought water most of the time. Fun: I had to take my daughter to the NY/NY Rollercoaster or I would never hear the end of it. $28 later, we rode it (I shut my eyes the whole time - I don't like heights!). We went to their arcade, Rainforest Cafe for lunch at MGM Grand. I took my daughter across street to Flamingo Wildlife Habitat - Nice birds, turtles, Koi fish! Went shopping. Went to the Dirk Arthur Extreme Magic Show at Tropicana - very nice magic show with Lions. Good value at $30, as well! QUA SPA: I had my husband booked for a massage for his early birthday present. They run a $99 special Sun - Wed. with full use of the spa/gym all day and a massage. He enjoyed it up until the end when he slipped and fell in the steam room. He hurt his back. They did fill out accident report, but that's about it. No follow up calls to see how he was doing or anything. I did enjoy the spa baths and steamrooms (especially the artic ice room), however. Thus, with my husband layed up with a hurt back, we couldn't go see Love as we had wanted to. Next time for sure. He's feeling much better now! So, that pretty much sums it up! Much drinking, gambling with little wins, a couple of nice restaurants, alot of pool time, and the token arcade/magic show for the little one.

Location \u2013 Best location on the strip, about midway up. Next to Bellagio, across the street from the Flamingo, which means the Venetian or MGM is only a 10 minute walk away. Even if you don\u2019t like the casino at Caesars, you are very close to a range of others. And if shows are your thing, there is a half price tix booth right across the street at Bills. Check-in \u2013 We checked in at 1:15am (thanks crazy reduced airline schedules!), but this seemed to work to our advantage; the line was non-existent (just one person in front of us), and we got a free upgrade! The staff member was on the computer for 5 minutes or so with the occasional apology for the delay, but then declared that the rooms weren\u2019t coming up so he upgraded us! We booked the Classic Room, but got an Augustus Tower room (needless to say, this review might have been different if we had got the room we paid for!). Staff member at reception was very polite and helpful despite the late hour. Worth noting that when we passed reception at other times, lines were huge, so if you are arriving at an earlier hour, bring a book. Room \u2013 Augustus Tower Rooms are marvelous! The d\u00e9cor is modern, with just enough hints of the Roman theme to fit without being tacky. The view was of the strip and the mountains, if you looked to the side of the window \u2013 otherwise straight ahead was just the roofs of the casino buildings (they should really think about putting solar panels on them \u2013 such a waste of space!). The bed was very comfortable, room was clean. Nice sofa and armchairs, so when relaxing one doesn\u2019t have to sit on the bed like a teenager in his room. Closet had a safe, robes and slippers. The bathroom had twin sinks (always a wife-pleaser), a separate small room for the toilet, a TV and separate bath and shower, with the bath being a whirlpool bath! After reading reviews on this site I didn\u2019t even touch the mini-bar fridge for fear of false billing. TV had a nice selection of channels, and was a new LCD. Restaurants \u2013 Every time we went past most of the restaurants, there was a line, so we ate elsewhere. Amenities \u2013 Casino is a nice size, but didn\u2019t have a lot of Video Poker (our game of choice) so we ended up not gambling here at all. Have gambled here in the past, but there is just something that doesn\u2019t make it appealing. Didn\u2019t use the pools, so no comment on them. We did however use the Qua Spa, and I have to say it is phenomenal! You can use the gym for $25, or the whole facility for $45 \u2013 I recommend the $45 day pass! I was shown the facilities and given a locker, as well as robe and slippers, then set off for the gym. The gym is very well equipped and compares favorably to some private gyms, let alone the usual sad excuse for a hotel gym. Post workout, your options are incredible \u2013 plan to spend a whole afternoon here! Sauna, steam room (so steamy I couldn\u2019t see anything beyond 2 feet), steam room with eucalyptus, and a cold room, with moisturizing snow! There is a hot tub, as well as roman mineral baths, of different temperatures. Showers have body wash, shampoo and conditioner in them as standard. Once done, you can shave in the well lit bathroom (shaving gel and razors provided), then relax in the tea room, which has a large TV showing ESPN, magazines for men, a range of five different fancy teas, as well as snacks, fruit and choices of water or juices. At no point did I feel pressured to leave or hurry up. If the rest of your vacation involves late nights, drinking and over-indulging this is the perfect recovery for you. The only time I got a bit miffed was with the staff at the gift shops, who really didn't seem interested in serving someone who only wanted to buy a postcard, to the point where I just walked out the first one after waiting a ridiculous amount of time. Checkout \u2013 I checked the bill online through the hotel TV, and there was almost no wait at reception to get a copy of the bill and hand the keys in. Bill was correct, staff very friendly. Overall, the best experience at a hotel in Vegas so far.

Once back at the check in desk we asked for the before mentioned upgrade. The clerk had already assigned that room so she gave us an even bigger room in the \"Augustus Tower\", for the same price as the smaller room. Lets just say we made a good decision. The room was clean, well furnished, great view, and we all slept well with no outside noise heard. As with most rooms in vegas, there was no coffee maker, no fridge, etc. Stay away from the food and drink bar. If you lift an item out of it's place, a sensor is alerted and you will be charged. We had to get creative when icing down our beer. The beds were very comfortable and AC worked very good. WiFi in the room is $15.00 a day. The restaurants at Ceasar's are very expensive, $77.00 ribeye is a bit much. We only ate at Ceasar's for breakfast, in the food court. Average price for a 3 egg omelet, 4 pieces of toast, potatoes, and large coffee was $14.00. A little high but we couldn't eat all we were served. We did have a late night bacon cheesburger combo one night, same food court, $15.00, and it too was huge. Very good food as well. I utilized the workout facilities for the three of the four days while there. It's normally $25.00 a day but they had a 3 days for $50.00 deal which was o.k. The gym was clean and the equipment was new but it lacked somewhat in space. It has a very small area for the hand weights and free weights. Other than that I was able to get a good workout in. If you plan on getting some sun by the pool, plan on getting down there before 1000 a.m. If you don't, you'll find yourself walking in circles waiting on a chair to open. Even though it was crowded the chairs are only 3 rows deep in most areas so it wasn't too bad. Drinks at the pool are around $12.00 for 12 ounce and $19.00 for 16 ounce. Some kids but not alot. That\"s important to me as I don't want to listen to a bunch screaming and crying while lounging. Spoke to a security guard who told us that two additional pools are supposed to open in Aug. 09 but they may be running a bit behind. That would bring the total to 5 pools. The slots paid pretty well at Ceasar's. Three out of four of us took extra cash home from the slots. Can't speak for the blackjack tables or poker. All in all the hotel is very clean and well maintained. No complaints about any of the staff. Plenty of bar maids both in the casino and at the pool. I'm already planning another trip in Sept. of this year and I will be staying at Ceasar's Palace.", "Date": "July 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "pa", "Title": "\u201cOkay Stay\u201d", "Author": "theresa1970", "ReviewID": "UR34507227", "Content": "I stayed here for 2 nights as part of my nine day stay and did enjoy it.

We picked Caesars Palace for it's great mid-strip location (we didn't plan to really leave the strip and did not want to rent a car). Here's how we found it: Location = Mid-strip can't beat it. You will do a lot of walking with thousands of complete strangers but....that's Vegas. The hotel is HUGE, lots and lots of walking so bring the right shoes. Rooms = We upgraded to the Palace tower upon arrival for an additional $25.00 a night. This is the closest tower to the pool and that was one of main reasons for going. The room was very spacious as was the bathroom, excellent jacuzzi tub and separate shower. We heard horror stories about the Roman tower and wanted to avoid it at all costs. Housekeeping = top notch, room was kept very clean and no personal items were disturbed. Prices = Food and drink are not cheap at Caesars; the food court is the best bet where most meals were about $10.00 each. Soft drinks at the pool are $3 to $4 a piece. Alcohol at the bars is armed robbery, one night my wife and I each had a simple shot and it was $30.00 for both! Pools = You may have heard the pools are being upgraded or rather new additions. They are in the process of adding new pools and finishing construction on a new tower and meeting facilities.....all of this is around the pool. Dust and construction noise surround 50% of the pool area and you can't help but notice them. The pool chairs fill up on the early side, we were at the pool by 8am and had no problem but by 11am you were out of luck. There are two main pools available now with a 3rd \"European\" pool available for an extra charge. Not enough chairs for the crowd that hits the area so get there early if you want to sit. Bottom line; nice and big place pick the right tower and wait a few months if you plan on spending time at the pool.", "Date": "July 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cPerfact Vacation!!!\u201d", "Author": "Zero2ero", "ReviewID": "UR34395076", "Content": "I had a great package deal at Travelocity (I booked about 6 week advance) for this hotel.

If you don't ask, you will not get it. Don't ever touch anything in the fridge in your room, eventhough you don't open, they scan things that removed and charge you for it. We did not try the restaurents in this hotel (very expensive, but I am sure they are good), but we tried at Beijing Noodle 9. If you like a chiness food, you got to try! Handmade noodle and dumpling are just perfact!

I was somewhat concerned because I knew that check-in was at 3:00pm. There were perhaps a half dozen folks also attempting to check-in early. The woman at the front desk was very friendly and accomodating. She was able to find me a room (and EVEN upgraded it at no cost). I was in the Palace Tower right near the pool. This was perhaps the easiest tower to get to. You must walk through the rather smokey casino to get to the elevator. I was on the 20th floor and my room faced the Strip towards the right and mountains to the left. Wow! The room was huge. The furniture was modern, but simple. The king bed had very comfortable sheets, pillows and comforter..lots of huge pillows. The matress was firm, but not too hard. The air conditioner system worked flawlessly. The thermostat is on the wall, my room was hot when I arrived so I cooled it down to 70 and it only took about 15 minutes to achieve this. The bathroom was about the size of my living room. A stall shower, two sinks and a sunkin jacuzzi. I had no idea where the toilet was. Aha, it was behind the door and included a phone. The tv was flat screen and received an impressive amount of channels. A robe was included in the closet. The toiletries had a tangy, orange scent. I loved the lotion. There was an ipod docking unit/radio, but the docking did not work and the radio only picked up a few stations. High speed internet cost $14.95 per 24 hour. At times the internet was quite slow. The room was incredibly quiet. I never heard a door slam or noise from another room. It was very clean. My only objection was the maid walking into my room at 9:00am and didn't even knock. I guess she must have assumed that I was still out partying/gambling. You can check the cost you have accrued to your room on the hotel's tv channel. In addition, you can check out after 6:00am utilizing the hotel tv channel. The casino is large and perhaps one of the more sought out on the strip. I have heard that many people come over to Caesars to play the slots and cards. The casino floor went on and on and on. Unlike Atlantic City (which has smoking sections), smoking is everywhere! Even if you just walk through the casinos on your way to somewhere else, you are bound to get smoke blown in your face. After you leave the casino you are immersed in a huge shopping area with some of the most upscale shoppes in Vegas. The stores go on and on and you can get lost trying to navigate from one side to the other. The price of a Coach purse actually was higher then it would have been at Macy's, but I'll always remember where I bought it. The ceiling is a distinct blue and the area is very posh and made to look like a Roman street. Caesars is one of the largest hotels and it takes about 2 days to figure out how to get from point A to point B. There is a LOT of walking involved. Some times I found it easier to exit and walk outside then maneuver the massive maze. The Coliseam is the theatre where the top stars like: Cher and Bette Midler play. I saw Bette and had wonderful seats and she put on an impressive show. The pool is waist deep(so don't expect to be able to swim). It is a large circle surrounded by fountains and sculptures of caesar. There is contruction going on near the pool (a new tower is being added). The music at the pool was so loud, it drowned out any of the construction noise. There were many young people when I was there in the pool and nearly all had drinks in their hands. It was hot and the pool was crowded. If you want to get some exercise, you can actually walk around the pool a few times. You have to get down early because the lounge chairs get filled up quickly. I tried to get my space staked out between 930-1030am. Those who came in the area after 1100 did not have much luck finding a place to lounge. There is also a \"European\" pool located just outside of the doors. This is an adult-only pool area and the women can go topless. The waitress/bar staff at the pool are agonizingly slow. I ordered a drink and it arrived about 45 mins. later. It just appears that they do not have the adequate amount of staff to services a large crowd. I treated myself to a massage near the pool (in the shade) for $50 for a half hour. The masseuse was fantastic and very friendly. The pool store is very overprised. Unless you want to pay $12-$15 for suntan lotion (bring your lotion from home). Soda's cost over $2.00 a bottle and snacks range from $2.00-$4.00. There are loads of restaraunts, but they are quite expensive. I ate one large meal at the Japanese restaraunt (which I was told had among the best sushi in Vegas). The sushi was by far among the best I have ever had, fresh and tasteful. The cost was $25.00 for two rolls. One word to describe the Caesars staff--Accomodating.

You do have to get out there fairly early because they will run out of chairs as the day goes on! Once construction ends there will be alot more room.

The location of Caesars is ideal, right in the middle of the strip. The only negative point is that if you have problems with walking it does not have a sky train station, however there is one about 15mins walk away. The reception was busy as Vegas always is however there were only two people checking in at 1700. We booked the three rooms together and asked for them to be on the same floor, however the reception said they were unable to do this. We took a room on the floor below. Once at the rooms none of our card keys worked and we had to take them all back to reception to be re-programmed. The rooms themselves were a nice size and had everything you could need. However all our rooms had little problems. We had no batteries in our remote, no robes and no shower gel. My parents room had no slippers, three of the spotlights in bathroom out of order. My brothers had no toiletries and no toilet roll. The rooms were however clean. As the week went we had to ask reception for toiletries when we needed them, rather than them just being replaced by house keeping. It is not the cheapest hotel, but was still a mid-range and from previous stays I expected so much more!! The hotel buffet breakfast was probably the worst meal we had in Vegas. We arrived at 0900 to find tables as far as the eye could see of dirty crockery. Adventurely after the table had been cleared around us we ordered our coffee and juice. The coffee was warm and with no sugar on the table we took a bowl from another empty table as there were no servers around to ask. When one of the servers did arrive they told us those sugars were not for us and we would have to find our own server to get sugar!

I must say, I was not disappointed with the hotel, nor was I totally satisfied. It was okay, but I would probably stay somewhere else next time we go. We arrived Friday night, landing about 10:00pm. We got our car, and proceeded to WalMart to buy a coffee pot. (They actually charge per night for a coffee pot, so we bought one for $10.00 and left it in the room when we checked out.) The walk from the self park to check in seemed endless. Yes, this hotel is enormous! I thought people were exaggerating, or didn\u2019t like to walk, but they really weren\u2019t kidding! My suitcase handle broke during transit, so it was difficult trying to drag the suitcase on the carpeting throughout the casino trying to find the registration desk. By the time we got to the hotel, it was already 12:00 midnight (3:00 am EST), so maybe I was a little tired and testy too. After doing the research on Trip Advisor, I reserved the Forum Tower above the Classic Room, and was a little apprehensive that we would lose this room due to the late check-in, especially since it was comped. But to our surprise, they up-graded us to the Palace Towers, 20th floor. The room was okay, had a nice unobstructed view, and we still received our requests of king bed/smoking. The bathroom was large, with a Jacuzzi tub, but we never used it. The employees were very friendly, going out of their way to say good morning and chitchat a bit. I have no complaints about the staff and housekeeping. The thing that I really did not care for, was how the hotel nickel and dimes it\u2019s customers. I already mentioned the coffee maker, which annoyed me a little, but when we checked in they told us about the amenities/stocked refrigerator in the room. They said that everything is scanned, and even if you just pick something up and look at it, your room will be charged. Needless to say, we steered way away from all of these items for fear of knocking something down! I read this before on one of the reviews, but still, it was a bit disconcerting. They also charge per day to use the gym, but with all of the walking we did, the gym was not needed. Hotel Internet was also charged by the day, but my BF has an air card, so we did not need to purchase this. Since we did not pay for the room, I shouldn\u2019t complain about the extra charges. But had we paid regular price for the room, I would not have been happy at all! Both my BF and I did not care for the Casino at this hotel. It seems there are two areas for gambling, one area was mainly tables with some slot machines placed around, and the other area was the slot machine area. Neither my BF nor I play the table games; we play the slots and my BF\u2019s favorite is Keno. But at Caesar\u2019s, they did not have the Keno machine he likes, so we spent most of our time out of the hotel. There was something about the layout neither one of us liked, and when I spoke to other people, they also felt the same. We spent a lot of time at Bill\u2019s, which was right across the street. Kind of a locals type of place in the middle of the strip, and fun. For all the time we spent there, I only saw Big Elvis\u2019 show once, at its tail end, but I think I would have really enjoyed seeing the whole thing. It was quite entertaining! The 99 cent Margaritas were pretty good too! Even though I picked this hotel for its pool area, we did not use it at all. In fact, we didn\u2019t even look at it! I read that part of the pool area was under construction. With that in mind, coupled with the occupancy at the hotel, I thought the pool area would be wall-to-wall people, and not very relaxing. But Vegas is not a place to relax! We were on the go constantly, and it was a good thing I brought comfortable walking shoes. I think the best thing about the hotel was the location. It was centrally located between the Bellagio, and the Mirage. The Forum Shops are connected, although we never walked through them. We rented a car, but hardly used it. I don\u2019t think we would get a car next time, unless we leave the city. The traffic was terrible; I think I could walk to most places faster. The last day we planned to go to the Lake Mead area, but found out that same day President Obama was staying at our hotel, which made for an even more chaotic atmosphere, and decided not to give up our prime parking spot. It must have been fate that we couldn\u2019t go, because my BF won the jackpot at Keno at the Bellagio! One day we drove to Fremont Street (the old Las Vegas), and I loved it! They are celebrating Summer of Love, the 60\u2019s. Blood, Sweat and Tears played during the afternoon, and they will have other relatively well known bands from the 60\u2019s playing there throughout the summer. They also had another band playing 60\u2019s rock, along with a jazz musician, and probably others that I missed. The light show was spectacular! I couldn\u2019t describe it, but it was of course 60\u2019s themed, and made the visit to Fremont worth the trip. That, and the 99 cent shrimp cocktails we had for lunch at one of the casinos. All in all, we had a really good time in Vegas. I did a lot of research, thanks to everyone\u2019s input on Trip Advisor, so we were prepared with a list of things to do and see. We didn\u2019t have the time to do and see everything, and at times I felt I was on sensory overload, with only 5-6 hours of sleep. I\u2019m glad it was just my BF and me, because I think with more people, it would be too confusing, trying to coordinate times and desires. We spent about 4 full days there, and probably another day would have been good for us, being that it was our first trip. I guess we will have to plan another trip for next year!", "Date": "June 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brunswick, GA", "Title": "\u201cWorth staying there if only for the spa and location.\u201d", "Author": "BRose007", "ReviewID": "UR32643420", "Content": "We just back from our first trip to Vegas. This is a beautiful hotel, but the service could be better. After we had waited in a very long line to check in, one desk clerk beckoned us to her station, only to walk away. So we were just standing there - there were a few guys in suits walking around behind the desk, not doing anything - certainly not offering to help. When someone finally did help us, they told us our room wasn't ready, but they had some upgrades available for an extra cost (of course). I wish we had taken her up on that, but I'll get to that later. Anyway, she wouldn't even pre-register us. We had to drop off our bags at the bell stand, then 45 minutes later, go stand in the long line again. The room (in the Roman Tower) was a good size, but a little tired. The white tile in the bathroom needs replacing, or at least the grout needs to be bleached. The carpet was coming loose at the edges in several places. The hairdryer in the room may as well have been someone with emphysema blowing on my hair, for all the power it had. And the shower - only a small soapdish for shelving. I had to put shampoo, conditioner, razor on the floor. The breakfast buffet at Cafe Lago was disappointing. Definitely go across to the Bellagio or Paris for their buffet. Casino: the dealers - except for the girls in the Pussycat Dolls casino, looked and acted miserable. Pool: lots of construction going on, but that didn't really affect our experience there. Other things did, though: very slow service at the pool bar- they seemed to be understaffed. We had a very hard time finding lounge chairs. We could have spent God-knows-how-much on a sunbed or cabana, but we were on a budget. We ended up finding two chairs that were not even next to each other. That wouldn't have bothered me so much, except for the fact that no one ever asked us for our name, room key, or anything to prove we were hotel guests. I wonder how many of the people taking up the lounge chairs had no business being there in the first place. Spa: The only reason I'd go back to this hotel. Qua Baths and Spa is amazing! Impeccable service, gorgeous facility. Be sure to take your bathing suit if you're modest, though. The amazing whirpool baths are bathing-suit optional. I enjoyed the herbal steam room, followed by the arctic ice room. Greg gave me the best massage I've ever had. He really understood what kind of pressure I needed, and where I needed the most work. Awesome. Ask for him! Another cool thing is all the toiletries they provide for your after-treatment freshening up. All you need to bring is your make-up - they have everything else. Cool spa gift shop, too - with reasonably priced merchandise. All in all, the spa and the location keep this from being a bad review.

I arrived at check-in around 1:30. I was told the official check-in time had not begun, but the woman at the front desk said she was able to find a room for me. She did not mention Hotwire, and gave me my key and directed me toward the Palace Tower. I was very pleasantly surprised to see I had been given a Palace Deluxe room. The room is very spacious for a non-suite, I would guess around 550 sq ft. The king-size bed I requested was very comfortable. A lounge chair and couch are provided, and they really add some comfort to the room. The desk is where I worked on my computer the little I had to, and it has a beautiful oval mirror above it. High-speed internet is $13, no surprise, and they do not offer wireless internet, at least in the Palace Tower. The television in the room is adequate, though I would have expected a bit more. It's a 26-inch LCD tv that did not display HD channels. The channel selection was good. The bathroom is incredible. A giant square mirror rests over two golden sinks, with a beautiful and deep tub to the right. There is a separate shower area which I appreciated, and the toilet is in a small room by itself. No tv in the bathroom. The bathroom's marble floors were the best part. The view from my window was of the incredible pool area below. Unfortunately, the pool was currently under construction so I had a good view of that. However, under normal circumstances, the view from my room would be superb, and I still enjoyed it myself. One negative thing about the room I can say is that it is not well lit, even during the daytime. I had all the lights and lamps on, and the blinds on the window fully open, and it was still rather dark in my room. This is pretty typical of many hotel rooms, but it's something I always notice. There is a fully-stocked minibar that, not surprisingly, is very expensive. There are also some chocolates, snacks, and beauty kits that you can take from the room, which are very expensive as well. A fair warning - I picked up several of these snacks and items to examine the contents. I discovered at check-out that there are sensors where the items are kept to tell the hotel what you have taken. Even though I am confident I put everything back in its place, upon checkout my bill showed two of the items. I told them I had not taken them from the room and they promptly removed them from the bill. The casino at Caesar's is very good. I do not play many slots, but prefer poker, and Caesar's has one of the best poker rooms on the strip, if not the best. They have a pretty good selection of high- and low-level games throughout the casino, though I had some trouble finding a blackjack game during the middle of the day that wasn't a $25 minimum. As stated before, I had the minor problem at checkout, but other than that it was fine. The lines were short for me both checking in and out, and even during a peak check-in time (around 4:30) I only saw a line of about four people. I was very pleased with Caesar's, especially the room I got for the price I paid. I would gladly stay there again. It is a cut above the other 4-star hotels on the strip.", "Date": "June 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cCeasar's is disappointing in comparison to same or lower priced hotels\u201d", "Author": "RobLacroix", "ReviewID": "UR32467892", "Content": "I just returned from Ceasar's Palace with a group of guys down in Vegas for a bachelor party. We were not traveling on a budget and frankly, without our women, we were more tolerant to problems. Here is honest balanced feedback of the hotel (can't stand people that find no positives): Check-in: Horrible. We arrived on Thursday night at 10PM and still waited 35 minutes due to the fact that there were only 3 people at the front desk. As well, we were told that there were tons of rooms with King sized beds available, but none with two beds. After ten minutes of explaining that non-gay guys on a bachelor party don't want to sleep with each other, we were told that there were some rooms that were vacant, and a rush could be put on them with housekeeping. Why would they not try to clean rooms with two beds earlier in the day to make them available? Anyway, we were told would need to come back in 2 hours. When we did, we had to wait another 25 minutes in the VIP line. The guys ahead of of in line were completely upset about the room they had been given and the guy behind us told us that he was livid with what he had been given. This validated for us that numerous people were having difficulty. On a positive note, check-out was a breeze, however the hotel was completely inflexible on having a late checkout....on a sunday! haha Rooms: Huge disappointment. We were given 3 rooms in the Roman Tower and they were 3 star quality. The beds and furniture were old and tired (the pictures on their website were definitely airbrushed to perfection as the reality is much different when you walk in the room). The bathroom would have been comparable to that of a motel.....and the clothes closet was located within the bathroom (have never seen this before). There were no minibar/fridges in the rooms. There really was no view of the strip from any of the rooms. Instead, we were staring at a bunch of pipes and maintenance buildings. Pool: Horrible. Not even close to enough pool lounge chairs for the size of the hotel. We had to grab single chairs from all over and start grouping them together in one location, but pool security got upset at that. When we told them that their lack of lounge chairs was ridiculous, they backed off and said they would allow it. There were hundreds of people that had no chairs and left the pool area frustrated or sat on the cement. On our second day, we decided to pay $30 each to go into the \"Venus\" adult pool area and avoid the deck chair hassle. Unbelievably, we got in there and there were no deck chairs at all. Basically, they wanted us to pay $1000 for a private cabana or sit on the cement on the edge of the pool. Shouldn't a $30/person pool entry fee implicitly mean that you would get a simple pool chair? Ridiculous! We ended up exiting the Venus pool to once again move a bunch of single chairs by the main pool and lost the $30/each. Location: Only good aspect of the hotel. It is right in the middle of the strip and there is some great shopping (The Forum Shops) attached to it. Service: Pool bar service was horrible. I felt bad for the waitresses because they were doing their best, but there was only two of them that we could see serving the entire pool of hundreds. We ordered large margaritas ($20 each) on the first day and it took 45 minutes for them to get to us. The lobby restaurant was poor as well. We went there for breakfast on the last morning. We were given our drinks and then it took them 20 minutes to come and take the rest of our order. Sidenotes: The Casino was fine, but you need to be ready to play higher wager tables. We ran into a few Vegas regular gamblers who were staying at other hotels and gambling at Ceasar's. We asked them why and they told us that Ceasar's used to be a great hotel, but since their new management took over they have let the hotel spiral downwards and become chincy. We couldn't have agreed more. All in all, you can get comparable prices for other hotels like MGM Grand, The Hotel @ Mandalay Bay, The Mirage....and fairly close prices for The Bellagio, The Venetian, Planet Hollywood, etc. The majority of us have previously stayed in Las Vegas at all of these hotels. Even The Luxor rooms are better than what you get at Ceasar's.

I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be too crowded due to all the economic reviews I\u2019ve been hearing, but I was sorely mistaken. Valet parking was PACKED when I arrived at 10PM and it was closed to all but Diamond and Seven Star members. I remembered there was valet parking in back by the parking garage and headed back there. No crowds and I zipped right in. The downside is the long walk to registration. When I arrived at the front desk there were only a couple of people ahead of me and it gave me time to figure out if I wanted to give the $20 \u201cbribe\u201d a shot. I was undecided and I always wonder if I\u2019d come off looking like a fool. I waited till the last moment and decided the heck with it. The clerk was real friendly and he informed that as a Platinum member I could have stood in a quicker line (which actually wasn\u2019t moving so quickly). As of April 1, 2009 I was no longer a Platinum member and had been busted back down to Gold due to my lack of gambling over the past 15 months. My online Harrah\u2019s account has me listed as a Gold member, but my reservation had me pegged as a Platinum member \u2013 go figure <shrug>. It all worked to my benefit because he upgraded me to the 25th floor in the Palace Tower. Granted it\u2019s NOT the nicest tower, but it was close to the pool and I had a half-way decent view of the strip. The walk to the Palace Tower from the front desk is a bit of a hike, but it\u2019s not too horrible. I arrived at my room and was pleasantly surprised \u2013 the room had been recently updated (1+ year or so), decent sized, and the d\u00e9cor was modern with a touch of class. The room\u2019s most unique feature is its dual marble bathroom, united by a walk-in shower and featuring an oversized spa tub. The room was clean upon my arrival and throughout my stay. The room came with the following amenities: LDC Television, bedside clock radio with CD player, & MP-3 hook-up, Gilchrest & Soames bath amenities, wet/dry mini bar, 2 waffle weave robes, and an in-room safe. One thing I did want to comment about was the great job the maids did in keeping everything clean because many of the hotel guests did their best to trash the place. Each day the hallway was spotless, but by the next morning people had trashed it. Garbage thrown on the floor, cigarette butts snubbed out on the wall and flicked to the floor, not to mention the amount of empty beer bottles tossed about. People, I realize you\u2019re on vacation, but does that mean you have to act like a bunch of slobs??? Off my soap box\u2026 As you can see from my pictures, there is a great deal of construction going on around the pool area which was a bit problemsome. I didn\u2019t find the noise to be an issue, but the lack of chairs was a problem. I\u2019m not sure if this is always an issue, but 15-20 minutes after the pool opened, all the chairs were taken. For the next few hours all you see are people walking around searching for a chair. During my stay, the hotel was extremely rigid in regards to when the pool opened. People were not allowed out into the pool area until 9:00 AM on the dot. Therefore, that meant people started forming a line at 8:30 AM. A word to the wise, forget about grabbing a towel right away. Go grab your chair and then head back to get a towel after most people have gone through the line or otherwise you\u2019ll miss out on the prime real estate around the pool. Drink service was so so \u2013 I chose instead to walk up to the tiki bar and grab a brew rather than waiting for the waitress to come back around. The wait staff was working hard, they just couldn't keep up with all the demand. All in all I had a nice trip and would recommend Caesar\u2019s Palace to many of my friends. It\u2019s centrally located, nice pool area (when the construction is completed), nice restaurant and a large gaming area.

They had two pools open but for our intents only one since the other was \"european\" (topless). The pool was very crowded since it was the only one for the hotel, but worse than that was the construction that surrounded the pool on 2 of 4 sides. The noise and unsightly view lowered the satisfaction of the pool time a great deal. It was just plain ugly to look at. In addition we were hoping for the nice upgrade offers that we had read about, especially in light of it being our anniversary. We had notified the hotel ahead of time of this fact. There were three couples in our party (all arriving seperately). One couple got a free upgrade with little effort at all (and no tip required). The second got an upgrade for $40 a night. We were offered an upgrade (with a tip) for $50 a night. We declined their offer. This left a bad taste in our mouth. The people working the casino were very nice for the most part, and the store employees were very nice and helpful. The front desk just took away all the good will of the others.

We called 3 times with no one coming to fix it after many promises. Eventually, I told housekeeping that we had to leave to a show but that they should sort it out as it was now running onto the carpet. They assured us they would sort it out asap. When we came back to the room about 4 hours later, the whole carpet was flooded and the outside corridor was also flooded. They did however fix the plumbing. They simply left towels on the carpet in the room which were by then sopping wet. They didn't bother to move us or even make the offer to move us.

First we reserved this six months in advance as I was a speaker at a conference being held in the hotel. They immediatly charged my room when we placed the reservation as I recieved a receipt--that was alittle strange since normally it is a reservation and not a room purchase. Any way, several months later my bookkeeper notifies me we have another charge for the same room. They had charged twice. I had my staff get with them and finally we were ablke to get a credit issued before I arrived at the hotel. I had a long drive from a client location in California to Las Vegas so I get in at 10. My staff had reassured me it was a non-smoking king which is what they always order. After going through the pain of crossing through the casino to register (what a hassle but normal in these hotels) I get my key and we head back across the casino to the room in one of the towers. As soon as I open the room I could smell the stench of cigarette smoke. We wlak in and it looks like someone had laid on the bed and there were three cigarette butts in an ash tray. We were in a smoking room that was dirty (someone had removed all the amenities in the bathroom) so they must have come up after the room was cleaned and conducted their business on the phone while chain smoking and took all the amenities on their way out. We called the front desk. We were placed on hold for the longest period of time. They told us they would have someone look into it and call us back. Half an hour later we are still sitting in that stinking room. We call again--and again placed on hold. Finally we are able to speak to a human and they said they had no more available non-smoking rooms. We insisted. They finally found one in a different tower. They instructed us to meet someone over there. When we arrived we were surprised that the guard arrived only minutes after we did since we had expected to wait forever. He said he could let us in but had no keys for us and told us we would have to go all the way back to the front desk to get our keys.

We wanted to order two ice teas and a piece of cake since we had now been there for an hour. When we called, room service told us it would be another hour before they could have the two teas and piece of cake delivered--see a pattern here.

Now what--do I wait a long time for my meal or a long time for my keys to be delivered. Finally my coordinator was able to reach someone at Caesars that seemed to care. They gave me a complaint number to dial. She apologized and comped the room. I stressed the poor service and slow service as a systemic issue.

A group of 14 of us stayed there last month for a bachelorette party and we just could not believe the terrible service we received. To preface--the bachelorette's mother did the booking and is a regular Caesar's visitor. Upon check-in (at the player's club VIP check-in nonetheless) she was told they were completely booked and the 3 rooms for our party (mom and friend had their own) would be spread out on several floors, unacceptable for a reservation made weeks before. An hour later (at 11p) they finally figured out they could get us a suite in the older tower with 3 rooms adjoining. However the adjoining rooms only had 1 king bed each so we needed 4-5 rollaways to sleep the remaining girls (12 total). Fine, actually it was quite nice when we got there, if a little cheesy. It was definitely older but it had a bar setup and extra bathrooms, which was great for the number of females in close quarters. We were easily satisfied and got to partying. None of the keys worked for the adjoining rooms (the suite itself was really just a massive living room/bar, no beds). A while later \"Charles\" showed up with our rollaways, 2 of them! We told him we needed several more, AND we needed someone to open up the adjoining rooms. He was very rude, told us he couldn't bring more and couldn't open the rooms. Mind you we'd been there over an hour already and had made the call for service right when we got there. After some coaxing we got him to bring a few more rollaways and open the rooms, when one of our nicer friends went to thank him--was actually even going to tip him after that service!--he walked off in a huff and say \"yeah whatever\". That was probably the worst of the service we got all weekend, but it was within several hours of arrival so we were even more keen to the crappy stuff that went on the rest of the weekend. Our room was never cleaned unless we asked--we literally had to ask for them to bring up more toilet paper after no one showed up to the room for the first 36 hours and the bathrooms/rooms/suite itself were never actually cleaned, just new towels and toiletries brought. They never got rid of the room service carts, at one point we wheeled out a dirty cart into the hall because we didn't want to see/smell the old food anymore and it sat in the hall in front of our door for 24 hours! Oh, and I had a burnt/tasteless burger at Augustus Cafe that was one of the worst burgers I've ever had, let alone it was $18! I am far from a food complainer, I eat everything and it's especially hard to screw up a burger but it was literally flavorless meat, charred to a crisp (the edges were actually shriveled hard and black). One highlight, we got the BEST server ever at the sushi place, Hyakumi, on our last dinner. She remembered everyone's name in a party of 10, was super helpful, sweet and attentive. We wrote her a glowing comment card (and big tip) but when we asked to speak to the manager to tell her how amazing our server was, she said she was busy and would be right with us...and continued to walk back and forth in front of us several more times saying \"just a minute\", we finally just left after we realized she probably wasn't going to stop. Maybe if the managerial staff at Caesar's spent just a little more time praising good work, the staff would have more motivation to actually BE good. Overall, I know our collective bad experiences were probably just unfortunate conicidences judging by all the other comments--and like I said I've stayed before and they were pretty okay (I'm really not just a complainer, I mainly just write good reviews on here).

It was definitely worth it! One down fall was that the pool area was being renovated and there was some construction, so some styrofoam was flying around. Besides that, upon check in they said our room would be ready in an hour and that they would text me when it was done. They never did this, so we waited three hours to get into our room, which I was not happy about. However, I did ask if they could do something for the inconveneince so they gave me a 25 dollar credit to use at the hotel. I thought that was nice.

The show stopper here is really the very curt service and indifferent staff who will not hesitate to say no and treat you like yet another guest passing through. Calls to guest relations/housekeeping/room service took 3-5min before they were answered; check-in/out queues were long and processed by unfriendly staff; and more often than not deliveries to the room took longer than half an hour, once never arriving despite repeated, futile reminder calls. The person on the line even said it was barely 3min since our last call (it was more like 10-15min) and promised that the shower cap requested would arrive if we waited - which did not happen!

I went with a group of college friends for a few days, as we got a excellent deal on the hotel room. However, we believe that since we booked our hotel on a discount site (hotels.com), we were viewed as less important than other guests at the hotel when it came to service. When we called to confirm our reservation, we requested two adjacent rooms. However, when we checked in, they didn't even give us the type of room we paid for, let alone adjacent rooms. They promised a room switch at noon the following day when we brought this up at the desk, and said they'd be adjacent. Noon comes around and we find the new rooms aren't even on the same floor. Finally, we get them to put us in adjacent rooms (deluxe in the Augustus Tower, which is what we paid for) and they promise to call us between 3 and 5. At ten minutes to five, as they haven't called our rooms or our contact person's cell phone, our contact goes downstairs to find our rooms were ready. If we hadn't claimed them by 5, they would have been given to other guests. The room change was a headache. But incredibly worth it. The views were spectacular (we had a great view of the Bellagio fountains) and Caesars is excellently located with respect to other hotels and casinos, right in the middle of the strip. The coupon book we were provided with at check-in proved to help a lot, as we're college kids (lots of free food or discounts on meals). Both rooms were very clean and quiet, and the beds were very comfortable. The bathroom facilities in the first room (Palace Tower) were a little outdated, but still nice. The hotel was also very prompt in bringing extra towels and some amenities we'd forgotten (toothbrushes and deodorant). A small mix up also worked out in our favor. The previous guest in the first room we'd been assigned to had apparently spent a good deal of money in the casino and she'd been comped free food and bottles of water, all of which was sitting untouched and unopened when we arrived. When we mentioned this to the desk, they'd informed up she'd checked out and told us we were welcome to the food. Yay for free fruit and water after a long day of traveling!

Your True Rewards card works there too so whether you want high end or low end tables, they are right across the street from each other. CHECK IN: As per your reviews, check in was a nightmare...but we were mentally prepared. They have clearly cut back on staff and waiting 45 minutes for your room (at 10pm) is never good, but after reading your reviews I expected it. Those who hadn't been forewarned were FREAKING OUT in line. Especially the older people, my god there were some people flipping. A hotel of this caliber shouldn't let this happen, but with the economy in the dumps (especially in Vegas) you've got to assume there are going to be some cutbacks. Again, inexcusable but at least a bit understandable. DINNER: Rao's. UNREAL. If you're trashing Rao's in a review then perhaps you didn't know what you were getting into. Food there is top notch.

We tried to talk the front desk attendant into a free upgrade, but to no avail. We paid an extra $60/night, which was supposedly a great deal - a result of the bad economy. Speaking of the economy, I didn't notice much of a difference in the amount of people visiting over the weekend. The nightclubs, etc. were still packed/hectic. Anyway, our room was great!

It is amazingly overpriced - equivalent or superior rooms and amenities are available just about everywhere else on the strip. For the price, the room was very small. It also had a huge shower with more than enough room for a tub - something I always look forward to using on vacation - but instead there was only some pseudo-roman bathing bench. The TV was in pretty bad shape, about the worst signal I've seen on a hotel flatscreen. No changing of the sheets either, though unfortunately that seems to be the norm these days. When we checked in, we discovered that our minibar was not working. After three calls and at least two visits to the room, it was finally fixed. Upon checkout we discovered that we were charged $400 for the entire contents of the minibar - presumably when they removed the contents to fix it. Thankfully they were willing to remove the charge, but it was just another step in incompetence for this hotel. Service was generally terrible overall. We called for a wake-up call our first morning, but we never received it. Lines for everything are incredibly long and move slowly. There is also no security anywhere here apparently - I don't know if they've cut back, but every other hotel I've ever been to in Vegas had guards checking room keys at the elevator banks. Not so at Caesar's, and by the looks of some of the casino patrons, we didn't exactly feel safe. Some kids were having a party on our floor one night, and playing bass so loud that our room was vibrating til 4 am - no response from security there, either. And on top of all this, Caesar's somehow remains one of the higher-priced hotels on the strip. I don't know how they can possibly keep it up with the standards they display.

We used them at Augustus Caf\u00e9, which is the 24 hour restaurant located in the base of the Augustus tower. The food was delicious and the portions were very large. We both had enough left over for a midnight snack and the meal was essentially free. Definitely sign up for the rewards card to get all kinds of coupons and savings at Caesars. The gaming area is huge, but the minimum bets on most of the tables are very high. We went across to the Flamingo for lower limits. Also checked out Pure nightclub with the VIP passes received at check in. Very swanky club, but the drink prices were astronomical. Will probably do a bottle service with more people if we return. Caesar\u2019s location cannot be beat, right in the middle of the strip. We walked everywhere. The Forum shops were fun to walk through, very high end merchandise.

It was the highlight of the weekend for him and he greatly recommends this course to golfers. It was a short cab ride from the hotel and club rentals are available. The only complaint I have about Caesar\u2019s is that the mini bar in the room was sensored. I had been taking out items in order to store personal water bottles and food, but once an item is removed you are charged for it.

It turned out to be some twentysomething kids, running up and down the hallways, and screaming at each other. This went on for 20 min., we called security.

The gentleman checking us in was very friendly and offered a room upgrade for only $50 per night. We took it. They even let us check-in early by about 3 hours. This was a blessing in itself after a long day of travel. The room was very nice. Two separate bathrooms, a shower built for two, a huge jacuzzi tub and a very spacious room. The bed was comfortable and the bedding was inviting and clean. We loved this hotel and highly recommend it to anyone. We stayed in the Palace Tower. If the pool was open, the Palace Tower is the place to be, it is located right beside the pool area. The casino staff was fun and friendly. Check out the Pussycat Dolls area! The only thing I can say that was a pain was the distance to the tower but one could complain about that with any large hotel on the strip. Also the food and drinks were very expensive so I recommend eating and drinking elsewhere (unless your gambling). Again this is true for many of the newer, larger hotels.

However, there are a few things you should know in order to make sure you have a good experience here. Let me start off with accommodations. The Augustus Deluxe, Palace Deluxe, and Palace Premium rooms are the best rooms you could find at Caesars' and are also the newest. The rooms in the Augustus tower are brand-new and the Palace tower rooms are remodeled to resemble the Augustus tower with only a few minor differences. These rooms are very nice, with spa tubs, and contemporary designs. The beds are fantastic and very comfortable. Also the rooms are a very good size, but you must know that the Augustus tower rooms have a different bathroom than the regular Palace room and the premium Palace room. The Augustus bathroom is roomier with a different design and a flat screen TV. The Palace tower bathrooms are the original Caesars' bathrooms from before the remodel which are still very nice but sometimes they are not in the best condition. The Palace Premium room is a very nice room, but in my opinion not worth the extra price per night, if you're comped this room then great, but otherwise it is not worth it. The only significant difference is that the Premium room has his and her bathrooms, no biggie. For some reason, Caesars' decided to go with the cheesy modern designs in the Forum Tower remodel just like the rest of Vegas is doing. I wouldn't recommend staying in these rooms unless you like the style or you get a very good deal, since at least they are brand new. Under NO circumstances should you ever book a room in the Roman or Centurion towers at Caesars', i am being very serious, those rooms are in horrible conditions, almost motel 6 status. If the \"Classic\" room is the only thing available, you should try the Wynn/Encore down the street, or Bellagio if they have a good deal. Also most of the time Caesars' is a little overpriced when it comes to rooms, be careful. Sometimes a classic room at Caesars' turns out to be the same price or more as a room at the Bellagio or a suite at Encore on a weeknight. Now lets move onto dinning. Caesars' has a very large selection of dinning choices. If you are on a tight budget however, i suggest either sticking to the Augustus Cafe, or dinning somewhere else. Because the fine dinning is amazing at Caesars' but the casual stuff, not so much. Stay away from the Cafe Lago buffet, trust me. It has a very small selection, overpriced, and isn't even that good. If you want great food try Spago, Sushi Roku, BOA, Trevi, Neros, and Bradley Ogden. Those are all great choices. As for the pool, its pretty chill and relaxing. Nice environment, large area, just nothing too special. Perfect place to lounge around and have a drink, or read a book. Also you should know that a tip a Caesars' goes a long way. When you're checking in, slipping a 50 or a 100 in with you I.D. and Credit Card could score you a beautiful suite. Most of the time if you ask \"What can you do for me?\" they'll even give you a choice. I have always had a comped stay at Caesars' but i have been upgraded by tipping a 50 from an Augustus Deluxe room to a one bedroom suite in the Augustus tower. It all depends on how you approach the front desk and how your attitude is. Be very friendly, and you'll always get what you want. That is about it, i know a lot about this property so please trust my advice and don't make any mistakes that could leave a bad impression of Caesars' in your mind.", "Date": "February 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cMixed reviews\u201d", "Author": "sjp1", "ReviewID": "UR24541732", "Content": "We got a good rate on this hotel by monitoring the website. We booked once and cancelled to take advantage of better rates. We stayed in the Augustus tower checking in on a Wednesday and checking out Saturday afternoon. The check in was easy since it was 11:00pm. We got the exact room we requested. The Augustus Tower is in a good location compared to the casino/bars/restaurants/strip. We were on the 34th floor looking out at the Bellagio. We could see the fountain show and had a decent view fo the strip. Our room was nice. It had two beds, couch, cofee table, mini dining table and a nice flat screen tv. The bathroom was big and had a little tv in it, a seperate closet for the comode, and a seperate tub/shower. I have three concerns with the room: 1)The room did not seem clean. There was a lot of dust and the bathroom felt dirty. 2) The linens were old and worn. The bath towels were very old and borderline nasty. They reminded me of the towels my health club provides...not nice and very worn. The sheets were also worn and flimsy. 3) Room service was disgustingly priced. The delivery time was about 45 minutes and that I can understand. But to charge $70 for a few bagels/cream cheese and some juice and coffee is absurd and almost criminal:) The Casino was fun and we usually had no trouble getting drinks. We both broke about even playing blackjack and went on some legendary runs. Real fun. The restaurants were unbelievable. We ate dinner at Raos(pronounced Ray-ohs), Joes in the Forum Shops, and Bobby Flays Mesa Grille for lunch. I will be doing reviews of all three of them shortly so look for those but lets say they were all good with Joes and Raos being the best! The best thing to me about Caesars is the location. It is smack dab in the center of the strip and you can walk everyhwere. I would stay at Caesars again but only in a new room as I have heard the older ones are pretty bad.

Hotel Management didn\u2019t really seem to care that the line was extremely long. There was a hotel employee handing out water bottles, but when I asked for a cocktail or glass of wine I was denied. Would it have killed management to have the same employee pushing a cart with beer and wine for people waiting in line? When I finally got to the front of the line there was uncertainty related to whether I was going to get the room that I had a written confirmation for at the agreed upon price. The front desk employee told me that all of the rooms at \u201cyour price are sold out\u201d, as if it was my fault. They asked me to pay extra to get into their next tier room. They still didn\u2019t apologize for the hour-long wait. They didn\u2019t offer a $50 hospitality credit to be used in a Caesars restaurant or bar for my time waiting in line. They were asking me for more money, which I refused. After a while they then \u201caccommodated\u201d me in another room, which was a normal room. It was as if Caesars had never checked in a large group of people before. It was amateur hour, and from speaking to other members of my group the line existed all day long. I thought I was in a Seinfeld episode. When the room was \u201ccleaned\u201d any dirty glasses or dishes were not removed from the room. The pool area was closed for renovation. Upon check out there was a $25 mini bar charge on my bill. I didn\u2019t even open the door of the mini bar. As soon as I mentioned this, the charge was removed. Nice try Caesars, but I look at my bill. My advice to meeting planners, no matter where you stay, is to write in to the contract a penalty clause if the wait is over X number of minutes, the hotel owes each guest who waited longer than the agreed upon minutes a certain number of dollars. If the guest gets bumped to another hotel, their stay at the other hotel is free. In the age of computers there is no excuse to overbook a hotel and for there to be extra long check in lines. It is absurd. Caesars has clearly forgotten which industry they are in, it\u2019s called hospitality. I would not recommend this hotel until it is sold to someone who cares about their guests.

Velvet ropes were set up to manage the crowd - apparently this is a daily event. No apologies to the guests; no refreshments while waiting; no management to acknowledge that this was apalling for a $250+ per night \"first class\" hotel.

It's $5 for a kiosk to print your boarding pass. Good luck getting a cup of coffee in the morning.

This trip was meant to be a friend's birthday weekend celebration that we planned for months. One of the friends that came on the trip was stuck to a wheechair due to a leg injury a few weeks before. Our flight coming in arrived at 8:00am so we went to the hotel and tried to check in early. The line up was very long, but we did come early and a lot of people were checking out so that did not bother me too much. After about 20 minutes it was out turn and we asked if it was possible to check in early. They said that they would accomodate us for an early check in, and came up with 3 rooms on the same floor in the Roman Tower. I asked if there were any rooms available for an upgrade, and the lady said that they were full capacity due to the Super Bowl Weekend. We made our way to the Roman Tower and were disappointed from the time we stepped off the elevators. The hallways were very outdated, there was garbage everywhere, there was a glass in every single corner of the hallway and not to mention it smelled of mold. Our rooms were nothing short of a motel! The bedrooms had no closets, the bathroom door was glass as was the wall that looked into the bedroom, so if you took a bath or a shower, who ever is in the living room can see you. We were a little disappointed but kind of debated whether to say anything, we figured we would not spend too much time in the rooms. The only other issue was that getting around in a wheelchair was almost impossible because the hallways were tiny. We decided not to say anything and were tired from being up at 3am having to make our flight that morning. Within 30 minutes we realized that there was no way we were staying in those rooms. The floors were not vacuumed as there were sunflower seeds and chips on the floor. The bathroom had not been cleaned and had soap residue on the tub as well as the sink. There was garbage on the bathroom floor and the garbage cans were not emptied. One of the rooms had (I assume by the looks of it) pubic hair in the bathtub. The ceilings and walls were mirrored, and there was a thick layer of dust on everything in the room. We immediately got on the phone, complained about everything and were told that we had to wait until noon. During that time we went for some lunch in the food court and waited for the managers. They upgraded us to the Palace Tower which was a deluxe room, very nice looking and definitely clean! The only problem was that the Tower was on the whole other side of the hotel, and had to wheelchair her through the entire hotel and casino. We took it as it is and were extremely happy with the new accomodations. But only for a short while... Their housekeepers clean rooms starting between 7am-8am, every morning. They do not care if the DO NOT DISTURB sign is hung, they will still knock. Every morning I would open the door and say, please come back after 10, and they would knock half an hour later. At check out, we had not only been charged things that we did not even touch or were not there when we checked in, but they cut off our room keys hours before our check out time. Their staff is so slow and although they are semi friendly, they are not fit to run a hotel of that size with the attitude of \"There is nothing we can do\". I would advise to stay at the Caesar's Palace and only to the Palace or Augustus Tower if the prices are unbeatable.

Of course, there's nothing that can be done about the huge gaping pull in the carpet, except maybe cover it with duct tape --- which would be a cosmetic improvement! At lunch, I came back to the room to work on my computer -- this is a business trip after all -- and guess what -- there were NO outlets anywhere near the desk. That was the last straw. So, I call down and ask for a new room. They are very gracious and assign me a new room in the Roman Tower -- I go down, get the new key, and check out the room before I move -- which does have a closet! But again -- No outlets by the desk. The only outlet on that side of the room is behind the armoire containing the TV. I go down again, and the young woman is very gracious and gives me an upgrade \"at no cost, since I've had so much trouble\". I go check out my new room in the Palace Tower, which is very nice -- complete with outlets by the desk so you can plug in your computer and Blackberry! I go back to my room to move my stuff -- I didn't want to wait for the bellman -- packed it all up, got back to the new room, and the key didn't work! The same key that had just worked! I had two keys, and neither worked. Housekeeping will not let you in and told me to call security, who had no idea when they could be there, and said it would be quicker for me to go back to the front desk. So, I trudged back down, the same very nice young woman ask how I'd demagnetized my keys -- no idea how I could have done that in 15 minutes -- but she redid them and sent me on my way! Finally! So -- only stay there if you are guarenteed that you are NOT in the Roman Tower! They should be embarrased to send guests there -- another woman told me there was no door on her bathroom! It is truly not an exaggeration to say that the Roman Tower is like staying in the Motel 6 with a casino! But if you are in any other other Towers, I think you would find them to be very nice and very much what you expect for a resort hotel or a conference hotel.", "Date": "February 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Florida", "Title": "\u201cHow much was that room????\u201d", "Author": "backyarder1", "ReviewID": "UR24007542", "Content": "When we arrived to checkin at Caesar's Palace, there was a long line of people ahead of us.

The agent did the $40 upgrade spiel (bigger beds) but we cheerfully declined saying we were just excited to be away from our husbands and kids for the first time in several years. The agent got a kick out of our excitement, and upgraded us for free. Our room was in the Palace Tower, and was definitely not a remodeled room. There is wear and tear in the tilework, the carpet and on the walls. However, it was spacious, very clean (especially the bathroom) and has the \"signature\" Roman-type bathroom, which we both really loved. The bath products (shampoo, body wash, etc) were great, and the hair dryer worked very well. The water pressure in the shower was fantastic, and we liked the fact that the toilet was in a separate closet, making getting ready in the morning very convenient. The beds were comfortable, and very clean. Our view was of the Mirage volcano, and the freeway. However, since we weren't in Las Vegas to hang out in the room, we really didn't care much about the view. The food court in the hotel is very convenient, and we both really liked the Asian place--especially the noodle soups. The only event that marred our hotel experience was that the alarm clock in the room next door went off at 6:30 in the morning on Sunday, and continued indefinitely. The room was obviously unoccupied and the previous occupant had left the alarm clock set. My sister mentioned it to the front desk that morning, and told them that may be something they should have housekeeping check when cleaning the rooms, as it definitely ruined our only chance of sleeping in. The desk said it was a security issue. What?! Having previously stayed at many of the other newer hotels on the Strip, I think Caesar's Palace is definitely showing its age.

We had 8 people, so we were trying for 6 beds. I slipped the guy $40 using the credit card/license sandwich. We were promised 2 suites with 2 beds for an extra 100 a nite, and an upgrade to Augustus tower for one room. Only one suite was ready, so we looked at it. The room was in the Roman Tower. The suite was nice but old and dated. He also offered to give us a better suite the next day if we so desired, as the hotel was going to be clearing out and dozens of suites would open up. The one he gave us was clean and very roomy, with 2 double beds in one bedroom, a large living room/dining room combo, and 2 large granite bathrooms. There was no view, but I thought for the money it was a great bargain.( My brother decided not to change rooms the next day). I went down twice to get my room keys, but my suite still was not ready. Finally, the guy asked if I really needed 2 beds; I said no, and he said he had a larger suite with 1 bed for me. It was on the Palace Tower. The suite was AMAZING!! It was huge, with a plasma screen in the living room (50 in) and 42 in in the bedroom. We had a king bed, walk thru shower adjoined to another bathroom, whirlpool tub,toilet and bidet, and another bathroom off the front entry way. There was a small granite kitchen that oped up to the dining room. It was almost as big as my house. The floors were marble. The carpet new, and a nice view of the strip. I could not have been happier!!!! The casino was PACKED. Maybe because of New Year; The casino was packed from 11 am on. I'm talking about having a hard time finding tables and machines for gambling packed~ The place is VERY smokey. Everyone was correct in their posts; I don't know if Caesars has any nonsmoking areas. We did OK gambling here~ no better/worse than anywhere else. There were a few cocktail waitresses making rounds for gamblers, (costs $7 for a beer ,16 oz aluminum bottle, and $10 for vodka and cranberry juice) but not a lot. The forum was packed, too. We ate @ Spago and the Italian place in the mall. We ate @ Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill, and it was awesome. They were all good, but very pricey. We ate Breakfast in the foodcourt @ Caesars. We used our comps for free meals. They had a great breakfast sandwich deal for under $5. We used Concierge to print our airline tix home; they normally charge $5 a ticket for this service; my husband tipped the girl and she did it free. It would have cost $40 for our tix!! We rented 2 cars, and travel to Sams town and golf Mesquite, Rio and a nearby local course. Security was absent thru most of the hotel. There used to be guards at the elevators checking room keys; no more. There were hookers all over, just as observed by others. There are some shadey characters in the forum , and in the parking lots. Make sure you travel together and keep your valuables close to you or leave them home. We did observe security officers in the forum. We walked around to other casinos, and found them to be much less crowded and smokey. I find the cigar smoke to be much worse than cigarette smoke. The low ceilings at Caesars are the problem.

So we had no view of the strip just work men getting us up in a morning. Then we went to visit the pool 'Garden of the gods' which had been influential in booking this hotel to find a secuirty guard stopping us going outside as the pool was closed due to the building works! You can imagine our disappointment it was 80 degrees and we had no access to a pool! We had not been told this prior to us booking the hotel. To top it all off after being in the hotel approximately four days we received a phone call from the front desk to say they needed to move us out of our room as the electricity was going to go out due to the building works. I was not impressed we had to pack up again and move to the other side of the hotel and when you think this hotel is massive this was not a simple move. I was not impressed with the handling of this i made a complaint and said i was not happy but they said there was nothing they could do.

One of the problems with visiting Vegas from the UK is that you invariably arrive fairly late and that can prove troublesome as regards you room \"request\". It appears that what you booked is pretty much irrelevant and you have to take whatever is left! This happened on a previous visit (to NY,NY) but in this case our friends - who had arrived a couple of days in advance and stayed at the Flamingo across the road - were able to check in earlier and so when we arrived at about 23:30 they had our key. We had asked for adjoining rooms but of course this was not the case. We had, however, \"booked\" deluxe rooms in the Augustus tower and we had the perfect location overlooking the Bellagio fountains, just by the lift \"block\" and opposite the ice machine. They were located some distance away, in a deluxe room but overlooking the front of the hotel, but were able to move to the adjoining room a couple of days later so all was well (we stayed for 12 nights)! Both rooms were larger than most in the central \"bulge\" - lucky us! The condition of the rooms and bathrooms was excellent although I was concerned about the quantity of water required to fill the spa bath, anyone checked out the water level in Lake Mead recently - we did!! I would go out on a limb and say that the rooms were the best that we had experienced so far - better than the fountain view room at the Bellagio last year although you have the advantage of the fountain soundtrack from the TV there - no such luck in the Augustus rooms. The only niggle we had was the noise of the emergency service sirens which operate 24/7 unlike the UK where they cease after about midnight until 0700. Noise was well controlled otherwise except for the fountains firing away until midnight - OK if you are playing the tables until the small hours but not for us early to bed Brits. We are not really hardened gamblers and consistently lost on the slots. I had wanted to have a go at blackjack - hopefully to offset the extra cost of the hotel (over $1K) but I left it to the last night when the Comedy Festival was in full swing and the minimum bet was $25 - too steep for my \"initiation\" to the tables. Coming from the UK where smoking in public places is banned we were reasonably happy with the ventilation although we had to move slot machines if a smoker sat at the machine next to us. There is an awful amount of construction going on on the strip and with the current financial situation even Vegas is having to cut back - so I expect that most of the building work to take somewhat longer than normal. Having said that we saw two stories added to the building opposite during our stay. Not part of the $9.5 billion \"City Center\" construction site but between that and the Bellagio. Non of this impacts on Caesar's Palace as their new \"Octavius\" block is being built directly behind the Augustus Tower and as such was not really visible. Having familiarised ourselves on the sorry state of Caesar's Place overpriced food from Trip Adivisor reviews, we eat out on the strip at well known chains such as Outback and The Cheesecake Factory (in the Forum Shops) - you know what you are going to get and the price is right! You can use the unsecured WiFi at the Apple shop (also in the Forum Shops) to check your emails as the ridiculous price of $13.99 + tax per day internet access is outrageous in this day and age. All the hotels on the strip are the same so knowing about the Apple shop is useful - there is also one in the Fashion Show Mall. We took in 3 Cirque du Soleils - The Beatles \"Love\", \"O\" and \"KA\". We had seen the first two before and they remain our favourites. It appears that the new \"computerised\" mini-bars are another way of ripping off guests. We were caught out last year at the Bellagio for opening the door and chilling a can of coke. They charged us $20 for the privilege - took it off the bill when challenged and then re-billed it a week after we had left. Caesar's Place just blatantly added $49 to the bill despite us not even opening the mini-bar door. We had checked the TV readout of our bill and apart from a $23 addition for something we had not billed to the room and was removed when challenged; we had no extras and paid the night before leaving as we had an early start. We challenged the addition on our return to the UK and without any hesitation the operator refunded our card. Highly suspicious - I'll be keeping an eye on our credit card account. We rate our stay at Caesar's Palace vey highly - but we were lucky with the rooms. No problem with the maid service although it was pretty much late afternoon for our friend\u2019s room but ours was always cleaned by mid-morning. They say that they only changed towels left on the floor but we were given fresh towels daily regardless. We had a small problem with one of the TVs - but a call to room service had it fixed within 10 minutes - excellent. We do recommend Caesar\u2019s Palace based on our experience but as we like to sample a different hotel every trip I doubt that we will be returning there anytime soon.

We asked for the manager to come to our room and she was with us within an hour.

We were also not notified of the building works around the pool area, if you wanted to have a relaxing time around the pool there was no hope due to expansion works. I also agree with the other reveiwer that the Augustus Cafe was really expensive, we only ate in there once to use up the comp $100 but if we'd have been paying we'd have gone somewhere else, the service in the cafe was shockingly poor!

Once I decided to stay at the hotel he was performing in I did my homework and studied up on the many different towers and options that Caesars offers. Throwing all caution to the wind for this very special trip I picked the Augustus Tower with a view of the Bellagio fountains. I also planned on visiting the Qua Spa, which is located in the Augustus Tower. The room was very spacious and comfortable and the view was worth insisting on at check in. Even though we could not hear the music from the room, watching the fountains dance was always entertaining. We were on the 41st floor and could also not hear any road noise. We walked to the Luxor and back, weaving in and out of the hotels along the way. In comparison I appreciate the lightness and openness of Caesars Palace instead of the darker, smokier, lower ceilings of other hotels. I roll Craps and the dealers were friendly and outgoing and 2 out of 3 nights the tables were full of fun energetic people. We ate at Mesa Grill, which was delicious and be sure to try the espresso martini! Spagos was good but running a bit on it's name. Here's my big review tip...as other's have already mentioned...BEWARE THE MINI BAR! I woke up at 3am and was SO thirsty that I sprung for a $5.35 orange juice. No prices are posted, but I asked at the desk the next day how much my big thirst cost me. The next morning, unannounced, the mini bar lady walked in to our room. We were still in bed asleep. Even when she noticed this she proceeded to go about her business, checking our mini bar and re-stocking, without any apologies or explanation. Bolt your door, put out the sign and throw the latch! We even contemplated how difficult it would be to push the desk in front of the door....just kidding but we did think about it. I ordered room service twice and the food was very good. I was surprised that the next day housekeeping did not remove the table that they roll in with your food. I called and asked for it to be removed but they never came to get it. The old food was beginning to stink up the room so I put the table out in the hallway, where it sat for another day. The next time I ordered room service I told them to take the food off and take the table with them. I mentioned my other table out in the hallway, and they Still did not remove it. I brought my own little coffee maker because TA reviews warned me that there is not one in the room. This got me up enough to go downstairs to the long line at the coffee shop. The spa was wonderful. Loved everything about it. See Qua review for more. Vegas is all about attitude. There is plenty to complain about, if you want to. Or, you can soak in all the oddities that make Vegas so unique, keep a positive attitude and others will respond in kind.

Caesars Palace being the classic Las Vegas hotel and established name didn't take anything away from this round the clock attack, from the huge snarl-up of cars, taxis and buses arriving to drop off guests at reception, to the airport check-in like queues when checking in, to the slalom around what seemed like hundreds of fruit machines and thousands of gamblers in between the hotel exit and the entrance to the lift. Noise noise lights lights. To their credit, the front door staff were always on top of the snarling mass of traffic on their doorstep, although it didn't encourage us to take a taxi from there. Also the staff were unable to tell us where to take a taxi to when visiting a Las Vegas Wranglers ice hockey match (its in the Orleans Arena, in a casino complex near the Rio Hotel/Casino, should anybody be interested in paying them a visit). Check-in was also very fast and efficient, given the huge number of visitors arriving. The rooms themselves are large, modern, but with no great surprises or touches, very business traveller hotel. I was kind of expecting some OTT Vegas touches, no chance. Although I'm sure some rooms have a view of the Strip, ours was of a concrete roof. Probably a ploy to make sure the guest spends as little time in the room and as much time downstairs gambling. The one nice touch was a TV in the bathroom. The hotel complex is, predictably, huge and the free map given to visitors is certainly needed. I only visited a fraction of the hotel area during my stay and I'm a person who likes to explore their hotel from top to bottom. Caesars doesn't have any great architectural pieces or stunts associated with it, in the same that say the Bellaggio has its fountains and Paris has its Eiffel Tower, what it does make a big deal of is the Forum Shops. In fact its not really much to write home about, there's a lame robotic show to watch, a TV projection of a sky onto the roof of one piazza area that changes depending on the weather or daylight outside, and an interesting Trojan horse replica, otherwise not a lot to shout about. There are plenty of big name brand shops, but anybody living in a big US or European city will have seen it all before. The location is pretty good, conveniently halfway along the strip. Think before taking the Skytrain, it might look on the map as if its a stone's throw away, but trying to reach it through the maze that is the Flamingo Hotel opposite is nigh on impossible. The hotel also has a piazza area outdoors which it reserves for staying guests on New Years Eve, from where its guests have a great view of the fireworks celebrations. Don't expect too many great things from these either, I've seen far better in my local park in England on November 5. Its one of the biggest hotels in the world, never mind Vegas, so its hardly surprising that one feels treated like a number rather than a guest. Everything runs like a giant machine, albeit efficiently. What the hotel lacks is a sense of belonging, it can't hope to match the likes of the Mandalay Bay or Bellaggio for class, neither can it match the Paris, Venetian, Luxor, Excalibur or New York New York for outrageous kitsch. Its neither a classy hotel, nor is it a cheaper one offering value for money such as the Golden Nugget or Flamingos.

Not much of a view from our room as we were on a lower floor, but we weren't planning on spending too much time in the room, so we did not mind. I was surprised to read some of the negative comments about the service at this hotel, because our experience was first rate. Everyone from the front desk staff to housekeeping to the casino attendants were pleasant. The concierge could not do enough to help us with two restaurants reservations and show tickets. There is some construction going on at the hotel with the new tower, but I really did not find it too intrusive. The pool area is the most impacted, but it is still a great area... over the weekend the workers were not there, so noise from construction was not a bother. The location can't be beat, and while I have always enjoyed playing at the casino at Caesars, recent renovations have made the space even better. Nightlife, shops, restaurants are all great ... had enjoyed them before from other hotels, so it was nice to be within stumbling distance on this trip. The location of Caesars is easily on par with the Bellagio in terms of service and room quality. Add to that the history of the place and Vintage Vegas feel of the place (for the lack of a better description!) and for me, Caesars is the place to stay on the strip.", "Date": "October 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cIt's all about the Name\u201d", "Author": "TexasMaggieMae", "ReviewID": "UR21082308", "Content": "We stayed in the Palace Tower in a room with 2 queen beds and two bathrooms.

The beds were comfortable but believe they were only doubles, not queens. The room was nice and clean and really plenty of space for 4 since you aren't in the room that much. We had room service 3 times and although each time was a different person, they were the nicest room service personnel I have ever had. We arrived at 2:00, waited in the registration line for about 15 minutes only to be told the earliest we could get in was 4:00. The lady was extremely rude, even as far as mocking. When I told her I had a confirmation number she said \"I told you, all I needed was your name\". It was my first impression of the hotel and believe the front desk personnel should go to the same 'be nice' school that the waiters do. Now even though Caesars is a class act and I have always wanted to stay there, I was disappointed in the casino itself. It's cut into sections, so hard to find your way around and locate your companions. The ceilings are very low and the place just didn't seem clean. Most of the video poker machines were old, blurry or jumpy. After walking across the street to Bellagio, the difference in air quality, cleanliness and newer machines was immediately evident.

We were exhausted. We paid an extra $500 for the week's stay to have a room with a spa tub for my wife who has fibromyalgia, a chronic pain condition. Yes, we stayed a whole week so that we could enjoy our anniversary in Las Vegas and at Caesars. Here is what happened. I asked the Hotel Desk person to make sure we got the room with the spa as it was important to my wife, she confirmed, \"yes sir, the Deluxe Room\". We were given a room at the Forum Towers and walked across the whole hotel, which is quite a walk to get to the elevators for the Forum Towers. Finally we reached the room and my wife who was in pain due to the flight and late hour was so looking forward to getting some pain relief by using the spa tub before going to bed. As soon as we walked into the room it became apparent to me that the room was not what I booked. I quickly went to the bathroom to check out the spa tub and to my surprise, there was no spa tub or any kind of tub, just a shower. This was not the room that I had paid for and had asked the person at the front desk to confirm she was putting us in. My wife was very disappointed and I became very angry, called the front desk and the same person acknowledged that this was not the room we had paid for and that they did not have any left. I asked her why she did not advise me of this when we were face to face rather than sending us across to the other end of the hotel without any warning and getting us angry. It became apparent that they did not want any face to face confrontation so they lied to us and hoped that we were too tired to go back to the front desk in person to argue. They were right, my wife was exhausted and in too much pain for her to go and I did not want to begin my 25th wedding anniversary holiday by letting my blood pressure rise and getting even more upset. They did put us in the right room the next afternoon which ruined our first day while we waited for the room to get unpacked. Another most frustrating situation at Caesars was the construction and the lack of sun in the pool area. We were never advised that the pool area was reduced in size and that there was little sun in that area due to new buildings going up. The pool area was reduced to a fraction of it's original area and nowhere in the literature or at the front desk was anyone warned about this situation. We heard many many guests upset about this and swearing that this was their last visit to Caesars! Caesars main building and Casino was built in the 1960's and the low ceilings in the casino along with smokers, make the casino very uncomfortable and unhealthy for those who do not smoke. Extremely crowded and smokey casino, untruthful desk staff, no compensation for our trouble, double charges on our room tab for movies made this stay, and the closed pools and lack of sun in the pool area, would be our last visit ever at Caesars. Let me say that we have visited Las Vegas almost every other year in the last 25 years and stayed at Caesars every visit. Customer service is lacking in many ways with no sense of obligation to inform patrons of the construction ahead of time and with no sense of obligation to meet their reservation commitments.

My wife and i wanted to stay at one of the Vegas hotels that had the best pools for us to spend our days after a night of running around the town. Because of the new tower construction, the main pools are completely blocked from sunlight this time of year. The lifeguard said that in the summer the main pools are not blocked because the sun was more over head than this time of year. I sure I wish I had checked Trip Advisor prior to booking this trip. Everyone was crowded around the Adult only pool while we were there and it was not relaxing. Their were people fighting over chairs and sitting on top of each other trying to stay in the sun. Bottom line is that if you are heading to Vegas and you care about hanging out at the pool, I would stay away from Caesers. The construction is awful and the pool is a major problem right now.

Friends tried the same but on a busy weekend and although the clerk tried, couldn't get them anything better, so your best bet for an upgrade that won't cost you an arm and a leg is to try if you have booked on a weekday, or quieter weekend. The room was wonderful, roomy and had a great bathroom. Room service was quick and not very expensive - one night we ordered special coffees and dessert around 11:00 pm and watched the Bellagio fountains in the moonlight. So romantic! My husband even found a music only station on the TV and we turned all the lights out to get the full effect of the strip's lights. The high end restaurants were nice, we even did the Caf\u00e9 Lago buffet for one dinner, which was also fine, but the Augustus Cafe was horrible. Bad service and bad attitudes, and it wasn't even busy. The pool was nice but only a few hours where it was warm enough due to the time of the year we were there (Thanksgiving). The heavy construction wasn't going on then as many other reviewers have complained in the past, so we were lucky. Casino was good, no blackjack tables under $10, which is normal these days, but as the casino got busy, those $10 tables soon became $25 tables. The slots were fine, I played for hours, going up and down, even won a small jackpot. Since Caesars is part of Harrah's, sign up for the Rewards card for some food coupons at the buffet's mostly, as well, they send you offers in the mail for free rooms at the lower end properties, but free none the less.

(4 female friends (over 40) celebrating the good life) Yes, Caesar's is a 5* resort. All the public areas and restaurants are top notch. But if you are planning to visit in the near future and intend on using the pool area, I suggest selecting another property. The main pool no longer exists; a new one is under construction. Caesar's will advise three pools are open - YES - but all are quite small and shaded till after 11:30am because of the new tower being built. At the present time, it is not a relaxing enjoyable area with the construction and the lounge chairs have seen the test of time. Stayed in the Palace Tower - no complaints - very spacious & comfortable and cleaned to perfection. (I would suggest the Agustas Tower as it is easier to navigate through the casino.) The room contains a stocked mini bar (which I was aware of) therefore, ordered a fridge to chill water, etc. If you are a coffee drinker, there is no coffee maker in the room, therefore, you will need to order the service ($20) or trek downstairs to the tune of $4 per cup and stand in line. A complete inconvenience & rip-off when all you want is a cup of morning java in the confines of your room. Used the Qua Spa which was worth the $45. Did not elect a treatment service but the spa areas are gorgeous and relaxing - a nice indulgence from the Hustle Bustle. Downside - if you only want to use the work-out area, it is still an additional $45 per day. Come on Caesars, with the price of your room rates, give it a break..Yes, this is Vegas but enough is enough!! Enjoyed the Forum Shops (we are shop-aholics) and the restaurants - can't go wrong there - choices indeed. Would I stay at Caesar's again - probably not.

When Harrah's Total Rewards finally decided to comp me there, I went online and booked a forum tower deluxe room for 3 days. Journey from stepping off the plane to getting to the hotel in Vegas is always an unenjoyable one (confusing airport with no signs, long wait to get a cab at the airport, crossing your fingers that the cabbie doesn't try to take the tunnel, traffic jams, etc...) but that besides the point. When I got to the hotel, the check in wait wasn't bad (5-10 minutes) but the line behind me was building at an exponential rate. Got to the desk and before the clerk could say anything to me, I did what everyone who wants to get a good room in Vegas needs to do. Handed him my ID, my credit card and a folded up 20 dollar bill. He took everything, pulled up my reservation and once he saw my room, he said \"we can do better than that.\" He upgraded me to an Augustus Palace room on the 44th floor with an incredible view of the strip, all without paying those ridiculous upgrade fees. Ever since my second trip to Vegas I've used the tip the front desk clerk trick before he helps me out, and without fail it has always worked to get me a free upgrade. Anyways, the room was beautiful, clean and spacious. Large LCD tv and very comfortable king size bed. The bathroom was even about the size of a standard room you'd find at any other hotel on the strip. The bathroom had a small LCD tv on the wall, an oversized jacuzzi tub, seperate shower and seperate toilet. All in all, one of the best rooms I've ever had in Vegas. As much as liked the room, I've never really been a big fan of the casino itself. Even though I play enough for the casinos to comp me rooms, I only play on $10-$15 minimum bet blackjack tables, and I only found one table that fit that description, however the line of people waiting to play there rivaled the wait to get into the Paris' champagne brunch buffet. You think they'd get the point by seeing all those people wanting to play at that table that they should open up more. Matter fact, for the amount of people in the casino, there were hardly any blackjack tables up and running of any bet amount. However, if you like slots like my fiancee does, there is a plentiful variety and also open seats at your favorite games. Also, in my opinion, the sports betting section is unrivaled by any on the strip, you have to see it to believe it. Never been a fan of the food at Caesars palace either, unless you're willing to spend the extra buck at one of their many higher tier restaurants. I, however only like one gourmet meal a vacation, and since Caesars palace more casual dining restaurants are below par, I normally go elsewhere to eat. Basically, its a great hotel, with great rooms if you can afford getting more than a classic room there.

There was a private \"European\" pool for (I think) $20 per person. European = topless. Overall Caesar's is a good choice for its location, amenities, shops, restaurants and entertainment. Not sure about value since I did go with my friend who was on business. Tip: If you're on a budget, pack your own breakfasts and snacks, i.e. granola/fruit bars, apple sauce, crackers, etc. A coffee and yogurt at the Cafe cost me $13.75. Across the street is a Margaritaville Restaurant - good food at good prices. There's usually a long wait for a table, but if you can, hike up to the 3rd floor where there are plenty of tables open on their outside terrace.", "Date": "September 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rockledge, Florida", "Title": "\u201cCaesr's Palace - a unique casino!\u201d", "Author": "vierannie", "ReviewID": "UR20179141", "Content": "Caesar's Palace is unique in that it really has the feel of Rome, Italy, complete with beautiful fountains and sculptures.

However, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The rooms may be small compared to the Palace or Augustus Tower rooms, but they are fine. These new rooms have nice touches, like the extra soft pillows, the CD player in the alarm clock, and the Caesars robes waiting in the closet for us to wear. We really enjoyed the shower, which features dual rain style showerheads and is very large. You can use both showerheads at once, or turn either of them off and just use a single showerhead. I quite liked using both of them, but my husband is far more traditional and liked the \"regular\" one the best. The beds were heavenly, with plenty of soft pillows, and we slept well all 3 nights. Noise was minimal - we didn't hear anyone in the adjoining rooms. Our room was fairly close to the elevator and we never had more than a 15 second wait for an elevator to arrive.

Booked an Augustus Tower room for a very good rate of $170/night through the hot deals section of the website. I find some of the reviews a bit exaggerated (good and bad) when it comes to specific elements of a stay, so I am going to give a general review (without sensationalism) that may be more helpful to those visiting Vegas or Caesars for the first time. Checked in around 1:30pm. Nobody was in line. I asked if there were any rooms available in the Augustus Tower with a great view of the Bellagio fountains, and was given a room on the 36th floor of the tower directly overlooking the fountains. This could not have been any better. We greatly enjoyed watching the Bellagio fountains throughout the day and night. While we considered staying at Bellagio just to have a good view of the fountains, I am glad I stayed in the Augustus Tower at Caesars and got the view we did. It meant the Augustus Tower room gave us more bang for the buck than a similar room (Salone Suite) at Bellagio with a fountain view, which was nearly double the nightly rate. The Augustus Tower rooms are incredible. They are spacious, around 650 square feet, and have everything you would need in a hotel room. The bathroom is fantastic, as is having the extra sitting area space. All in all, a room in the Augustus Tower alone, assuming no problems with the room, would merit giving the hotel at least a 3* review. The Augustus Tower is the closest of Caesars' towers to the Bellagio, and Caesars is connected by a walkway to the Bellagio that allows for very easy and convenient access to all Bellagio has to offer. I would note that we ordered room service one night and it was delivered promptly and the food was good. I didn't think it was overly expensive for room service, and the food quality was good and I was happy with the experience. We ate at the table in our room while watching the Bellagio fountains at night. Other than that, I would note that Mesa Grill is fantastic. We had lunch there one day and it blew us away. I don't know that I would go there for dinner (there are so many places in Vegas for a great steak, etc.), but for lunch it was very, very good. There are some \"cons\" to this hotel, and I will note my observances here. Again, I am not being too specific, as these seem like pervasive problems at Caesars that everyone should realize before booking. Also keep in mind that many of these \"problems\" are shared by other hotels in Vegas, are not unique to Caesars, and would not keep me from staying here or enjoying my experience. First, the Caesars casino is bifurcated into the Forum Casino and the Palace Casino. It is not a very convenient setup, and makes for a lot of unnecessary hassle. Second, the Harrahs bureaucracy makes simple things related to service difficult. For instance, we wanted to get a total rewards gift certificate to give as a gift to others before we left. We were told the business center could do that for us. The business center's computer system was down when we went to get the gift card. At the time we were trying to do this, 9:30am, no other person or department in the hotel could do it (concierge didn't open until 10am, and they were the only other ones who could do it). I am always amazed when businesses make it difficult for me to give them my money. Simply put, and it is probably obvious to most, but personalized service is usually, but not always, directly related to the size of a hotel. The bigger the hotel, the less great service you will get. This rings true here. Third, the construction going on right now hinders the pool experience. While we are not big on the pool, I realize some people are. While I wouldn't say it was crowded by any stretch of the imagination, or that it would have been difficult to get a chair (plenty were available), it is tough to relax at a pool when there is major construction going on all around it. Fourth, there really isn't any good reason for Caesars' table game limits to be $25 at 9am when Vegas is very slow and there is nobody playing. I don't understand the rationale behind having multitudes of empty tables with limits like this rather than having full tables with $10 limits. Most other casinos including the Venetian had lower limits. While I play higher limit tables a majority of the time, I could see where others would be disenchanted by this. Other things people have written about I didn't find troublesome on my stay. That would include a review that suggested the air quality in the casino wasn't that great. I am very, very sensitive to bad air, and I find the air in any Vegas casino to be less than preferable. I played at Caesars, however, for three days and didn't experience a problem like the kind mentioned. Further, I find Las Vegas casinos on the whole have gotten much less smoky in my last several visits over a period of 3 years. Another review suggested you might get lost in Caesars or would have to walk for 30 minutes to get from one end of the casino to the other. Having stayed at many Vegas hotels, I would note that most all of them are quite large. While the casino separation is not ideal, I find it hard to believe it would take very long to figure out exactly how to get where you need to go. This is not MGM, and the hotel does not require more walking many others in Vegas. Further, walking from one end of the casino to the other takes 5 minutes, rather than the 30 suggested in another review, unless of course you are stopping for lunch or to gamble along the way. Overall we enjoyed our stay at Caesars. On this trip, my biggest priority was the room, and the Augustus Tower has fantastic rooms that also can be, depending on the rate, an excellent value in Vegas compared to other hotels including Bellagio, Venetian, etc. I hope this review is helpful in selecting a hotel for your next Vegas stay.", "Date": "September 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hull", "Title": "\u201cFilth, Bugs & Building work\u201d", "Author": "MuppetHull", "ReviewID": "UR19967458", "Content": "In an 8 night stay we changed rooms twice.

My room wasn't ready at check in, so I left my luggage in another friend's room in the Roman Tower (those rooms need to be upgraded). When my room was ready at 4:30, I checked into a lovely room on the 45th floor overlooking the Bellagio fountains (my request). The room is actually nicer than those at the Bellagio.

Plenty of drawer and closet space. Good number of removable hangers. I loved the flat-screen TV in the bathroom. Jetted-tub and glass-enclosed shower with great water pressure. Toilet was in its own private room--nice touch. No evening turn-down service (no chocolates either). Really disappointing thing (and the one reason why I class the Bellagio as better) is there is no security at the elevators to check for room key.

To start off, I'll first say that Caesar's is the perfect example of Vegas Opulence, in the very best way. The decor is truly a sight to see. Beyond that, this place is HUGE! Caesar's has grown so much that now it is absolutely massive. The only trouble is, they don't yet know how to handle their many guests.

I've never been told that the room I booked is not a guarantee. Luckily, one \"magically\" came up after we rejected her explaination. So it worked out. Or so we thought. She said the room was just being cleaned and should be ready in 45 minutes. We went to lunch and returned. Once again speaking to the same lady, she said the maids had not yet reached the room. Once again, we were told to wait. The website guarantees a check-in at 4pm. We were not allowed to go up to our room until 5:30. After more than 3 hours of waiting around (keep in mind we could not gamble because our 13yr old son was with us) we were FINALLY allowed to go up to the room. That should be the end of the troubles... but hardly. Upon entering the room we waited so long for, we arrive to find it is FILTHY. The coffee table had been pushed to the center of the room, the beds had been partially undone, an OPEN Redbull was sitting on the dining table, the toilet paper in the restroom had been ripped off, a half used pack of cigarettes on the desk, an item was missing from the minibar, and someone's room key was on the desk as well. At this point I had enough. We proceeded to call the front desk and they sent up the maid. When the hotel's maid is shocked at the condition of the room, you know there's a problem. They cleaned the room, and by that time it was nearly 7pm. Keep in mind we had all been driving all day to get to Vegas. We finally sat down and realized something.... Our Luggage hasn't arrived yet. So of course, we made yet another phone call and the luggage was rushed up to our room. An hour late, but when it comes to luggage, it's better late than never. Once having the luggage arrive and the room cleaned, we decided to rest and order something to eat. I'm sure you can guess, something went wrong. There was NO MENU in the room. We called down to Room Service and requested a menu be delivered to the room. After waiting another 45 minutes, we called down again. We asked to be updated on where our menu was and they said they have no record of any request. The man said they are too busy to get a menu up to our room and offered to read us the menu over the phone. ARE WE KIDDING HERE? READ US THE MENU? OVER THE PHONE!!!!! After now 4 hours from arriving to ordering food, I was not about to be dictated a 15 page menu via telephone. We agreed and quickly sent up a photocopied menu. We ordtered our food, and was told there would be a 45 minute wait. We had no problem with this as they can't control the fact that they're busy. The food came on time. WHAT A MIRACLE? But, oh no. We ordered a drink, which did not arrive. The delivery woman went to get us the drink and come right back. We had completed our entire meal and the drink had not arrived. Once again, we made a phone call and they said it would be right up. A couple minutes later, the same lady arrived with a tray of 6 bottles of soda and 2 waters. It was an amazingly nice gesture and we truly appreciated SOMEONE understanding our troubles. The amazing part is she would not even accept a tip. That is great customer service. We finished our dinner and went to use the phone. This time instead of using the phone by the bed, we went to use the data phone on the desk. But of course, it was broken. We called the front desk for the 4th or 5th time and they sent up a hotel manager to fix the phone, as the technical staff had gone home for the night. He fixed the phone but it was now very late and we were fed up with it all. We complained to anyone who would listen and were given a $100 food and beverage credit to our room. It was a nice gesture but at that point $1000 didn't seem enough for 8 hours of trouble. We accepted the comp and moved on. My wife went to gamble and won $400 on slots that night. A decent ending to a horiffic day. The next day, we decided to take a drive around the strip and have fun in the other hotels. As it was over 100 degrees outside, walking seemed impossible. Upon arriving back at Caesar's, we were informed that the Valet lot was FULL and we would have to park on the opposite side of the hotel. We informed him that we were staying in Augustus Tower (which is literally on the opposite side of the parking area) and he agreed to take our car. ----IMPORTANT PART:---- If I had any advice for travelers is if you have to travel here on a weekend in the summer, be ready for crazy crowds. Don't always accept the first answer as the FINAL answer and ALWAYS call if something's wrong. The one thing about Caesar's that I can say I'm happy with is their ability to right a wrong. For everything that went wrong, after calling, Caesar's made it right. So for that, I give them props. The decor is amazing as usual, and if you can, get an Augustus Tower room facing the strip. It's breathtaking.

I'm in Vegas once a year with work or pleasure and have stayed at a variety of hotels on the strip. We selected Caesars Palace because of it's great location on the strip and ability to shop at great stores without leaving your hotel. We arrived at noon but check in was not until 2pm. Not a problem they held our bags while we ate lunch at Mesa Grill (best lunch during our trip!!!!). We came back around 3pm and it looked like a long line (20 people ahead of us) but moved very fast (15 min.). The front desk staff were extremely friendly and very accomodating. We got to our room but was a smoking floor so we called down and requested a non smoking floor. They moved very fast and made adjustments to get us in right away. At my request for an upgrade they gave us a great deal on the Pent House suite (2000 square feet, 2 master suites, seperate living quarters on the 28th floor of the Palace Tower, hundreds less than normal per night, I know this because I tried to reserve it earlier this year and it was over a $2000 per night). At the pool you can see the construction of the new tower but unless you paid close attention you would not notice it. We did not hear the construction or anything like that. The Venus pool was private and the music was not that loud. I guess if you were looking for complete silence at a pool or just didn't want anyone around you then this place would not suit you (try a private island or a bath tub). We kept in mind that this is Vegas and you are supposed to have fun, be loud, and don't worry about things you don't have control over. Overall we loved Caesars and would go back very soon. I have stayed at the Venetian, Bally's, Green Valley Ranch and New York New York but Caesars is on my top 2. Great service, very clean room (I'm a germ freak and this place passed...Bally's on the other hand, not so clean), great location, great food, and very convenient to everything.

Every evening our beds were turned down and chocolates left on our pillows.

I noticed on our 4 day stay that there were times when the check in line might have taken you 2 hours. That's a real downer but a lot of these Strip Hotels can take you some time to check in if you get there at the wrong time. Same old routine at the desk. They will offer you a Bellagio Fountain view room or strip view for about $30 a night more. I did this for $40 a night at the Paris last year and well, I am tired of staring at that noisy fountain so I declined and took the 6th floor room at the Augusta's Tower overlooking the roof and could see some of the Strip to the north. The room we had was very spacious and you need space for all the stuff you bring with you. Like most Vegas Hotels that have a mini bar, your room will be charged even if you pick something up just to look at it. I am not a poor man but I will not pay $5 for a small bottle of Gatorade unless I am dying of thirst. No fridge in the room unless you pay extra and if they have any available. We brought all our drinks and munchies and such to save a few bucks and were at the ice machine quite often. I brought my own portable coffee maker so I did not have to walk a mile to the Java place and wait in a long line to get a $4 cup of Joe. Don't get me wrong, I love Caesars but I am a savvy traveler and refuse to throw money away needlessly when you can plan ahead. The best Buffet within walking distance is at Harrah's Casino. Make sure you sign up for a Total Rewards Card (free) and get the booklet to save money at the nearby Buffet's. Like the other guy said, the pool at the Flamingo looks way more exciting and inviting than the pool at Caesars. I like to stay at the nicest Hotels that Las Vegas has to offer and Caesars is without question one of the best but in order for me to stay there, I cut a few corners and refuse to let them nickel and dime me to death. I stay there for the very nice room and do my gambling elsewhere. Wild Bill's Gambling Hall is right across the street and they will let you hold your cards while playing and have tons of $5 tables.

Yes, there were a few pleasant people, however the bad attitude prevailed throughout. (Front Desk was pleasant, and even though there were 150 people in line in front of us when we arrived, it moved quickly and it didn't bother us). Over the four day period, I encountered one rude individual after another, mostly in the restaurants, cafes, service personnel. By the last day it actually became amusing and I came to expect it. Everywhere we went there were long lines and inefficient systems in place to deal with the large crowds of people. Value: Nightly room charge $240 - a bit expensive, average cost of breakfast for two was $50 with a side of attitude. The minimum table bet was $50. While I don't mind working up to this, I would rather have the option to start at $10 or $20 and work up from there. Pet Peeve: No coffee makers in the rooms was a real inconvenience. When I asked about coffee makers they suggested I call room service. I could not pre-order the night before as this service was not offered. The first morning we called and they said it would take 1 hour so we ran downstairs, waited in a line of about 50 people, all wanting the same thing and paid $8.08 for two regular coffees. The next morning I called again and it was a 90 minute wait. When I commented on the long wait, they replied this was normal. Once again, we ran downstairs to get our own coffee. At the coffee counter there were five people behind the counter yet only one to serve customers. The other four were cleaning, re-stocking or busy talking to each other. On the last morning there, I made a comment about the poor service to the hostess and she replied back \" yea, and it is getting worse every day\"! Highlight: The fountain in front of the Bellagio. Wow, this continues to be the best and most beautiful show in town. Best view is from the Bellagio lounge with a balcony overlooking the lake. When you fist enter the music is very loud, however if you continue on through to the back balcony you come upon this beautiful little outdoor patio and the only sound you hear is the music from the fountain show. Very romantic. They don't serve food, but the drinks were good and for $14 each it was the best value in town. Later we walked over to Mon Ami Gabi at Paris for some dinner. They have a great indoor/outdoor patio area that you can sit and people watch with a view of the fountain in the background. Food is excellent, but the wait is long.

I told him I was already booked and reserved for the Augustus Tower-- and he said no more. Our room faced the opposite direction from the Bellagio, but is was not so bad.

We also ate at the Venetian (Postrio--Excellent) and Planet Hollywood in the Forum Shop (very mediocre). We spent several days at the pool during the week and the crowds were not that bad. Pool is a mess though. Dirty water, brown tiles--but I knew that going in since the construction is going on--so I guess I was forwarned. Our cocktail server Maria was excellent.

The ones they do have are stuck all back by the garage entrance and there is constant traffic walking by there at all hours. Some other machines are by the sports book, but it is colder than Montana in winter over there. I ended up finding a few up in the Palace casino area (the old casino).

I frequent Vegas and usually get down there at least once a year and always have a great time, but a few lessons were learned this trip. To begin with, NEVER, EVER TAKE A CONNECTING FLIGHT IF YOU CAN AVOID IT!!! I flew out of Buffalo and was supposed to connect in Cleveland to Vegas. Well, the plane was supposed to pick us up from Cleveland and then return but it was over an hour late. Consequently, I missed my flight to Vegas that was departing at 12:45 and had to walk around Cleveland airport for SIX HOURS!!! until about 7pm when I had to beg the agent to let me on standby. Now normally I would just chalk this up to one bad experience but the last time I went to Vegas (March 20/08) the same thing happened at Washington DC airport. The flight back on that trip was fine but the flight back on the July 4th weekend was again guess what.....LATE!!!! I almost missed my flight again!!! Anyways the point is, if you can fly direct do it and just pay the extra money. I tried to shave a few bucks off both times I tried connecting flights and you know what? Both times it cost me almost an entire day of an already short vacation!!! As for Caesar's, a beautiful resort with great nightclubs, restaurants and bars. The pools were under construction so I look forward to better scenery next time. Also, on Friday the 4th the pool closed early at 4pm for a private party so we had to leave which was really uncool. Meaning, we're paying for this resort and all of it's amenities but had to leave. Pure was as always a great club with a beautiful view from the patio upstairs and the bars were always well staffed with great drinks. As for food, Caesar's is known for it's restaurants but I must say that one of my most pleasurable meals was eating at Payard near the pool. It's a beautiful bakery with wonderful pastries and fantastic coffee. We wanted to eat at BOA for steak and lobster but couldn't seem to find it in the Forum because it's not clearly marked on the maps. Spago was good, but not great and really not much better than The Keg. Our room was in the Roman tower and although the washroom was nice, the room was nothing special with a very unimpressive view of the AC units on the roof right below us. If you don't mind spending a few more dollars and also spend a little more time in your room than we did, spend the money on a room upgrade with a balcony.

Needless to say this did not go over well with me. I was told by this very rude man that since it was comped and I no longer had diamond status that was what we get and to bad! Plus the room was not clean yet and would be a hour before we could check in. I was fuming. I went to the casino host and was told the same thing(I was dropped back to a gold member in March because we no longer have a Harrah's in our area). So we wandered around for a hour and went back to the check in desk....This time I saw a younger lady so I headed for her. I told her our situation and she said she would try to get us something better...Sure enough she clicks away and says she has a room in the palace tower....I thanked her and she said to just wait a sec and she would see if she could get us the Augustus...At this point I told her if you get me that room you are getting a tip. I know long story but we did end up in the Augustus and I did tip her. I did not get her name which now I regret....I was so excited about getting the room I forgot. Now we have the room....It is a really nice room. We went to the casino and played for awhile and it was really small....We didn't realize until the next day that there are 2 casinos there...The palace and The forum casinos. I did pretty well at the palace casino. Food - We ate breakfast at the buffet....Not good. We had lunch at Cafe Lago husband and I both had chicken and it was $55 with 2 cokes....Overpriced and chicken made husband sick. Tried 3 of the food court places off the forum casino all over priced and not good. We did eat at the Flamingo buffet for dinner and it was good. We ate at the Golden Nugget...not good. And The Paris buffet was excellent. I highly recommend the Paris buffet. Back to the hotel. All I can say is WOW! This place is wonderful. You can walk for hours and hours and never see everything they have. Even though the food was bad and bad experience with check in the rest of our stay was great. We were in room 4283 and did not hear any construction. We did not get to the pool area. We were in Vegas 5 days and did not have a spare moment. As everyone says wear goodwalking shoes. Also be aware that a bottle of water is $3-$4 a bottle and also soda runs the same price. If possible bring some with you. The Duece is a bus that runs up and down the strip and also downtown. Take advantage of this. You can buy a 24 hour pass for $5. You can purchase this right on the bus. There are alot of bus stops so you don't have to walk to far to find one. This will be the best money you spent there. Fremont street light show well worth going downtown to see. Belligo water show excellent.

We came for a relaxing time by the pool and what we found was complete annoyance from beginning to end. I did ask for a Bellagio fountain view...and got it, yet was not told I'd also be staring into 14 building cranes for City Center. Also, the hotel did nothing for the 50th anniversary. The in-laws were not impressed to say the least. I was ashamed to have brought them there. We should have checked out after day 1, but they didn\u2019t want to repack and move. The pool itself had opaque water, a greasy film floating on it and cigarette butts littered around. You must pay for drinking water (in 115 heat you'd think they'd give you water to keep you from passing out), and pay for a pool float if you want it. If you want shade, you best be the first at the pool or pay some more money to get some. The pool closes at 7pm\u2026. It's 105 at night, the sun sets at 8 and they close the pool at 7?

Better yet, don't go. And the 7 month pregnant waitress in a bikini didn\u2019t help the ambience either.

We were told for $60.00 extra dollars a night we could have a room in the Augustus Towers.

We were very impressed with everything -jacuzzi tub, marble floors, double granite top vanities, 2 flat screen tv's a sitting area, mini bar and most of all, it was very clean. We never heard a peep from anywhere, not construction or neighbors. It was great! The only problem we encountered was with our tv remote(didn't work at times), but no big deal.

Well, we just got back and that's why i say...never again.

Air conditioning in room was not very good, No temperature control, only a switch to move from hot air to cool air, and a Low, Med, or high fan setting. Also when air conditioning was on, a faint clanging/banging noise was apparent in bathroom, and could be felt in room also. Had an In-Room safe that was probably there from the sixties(actually came in handy though). The final problem with this room was it had adjoining room doors in it, 2 of them! On either side of room there was a door connecting to the next room. I was able to hear almost every word spoken from the rooms next to us. One more thing, the housekeeping staff likes to start cleaning very early, at about 8:30am they start knocking on doors. They were very banging into walls with their carts and talking very loudly. They knocked on our door at about 9am, even though we had a \"do not disturb\" sign hanging. Not very impressed with Caesars Palace at all, will not be staying here again. One other note, everything is way overpriced here, payed about $10.00 for a sandwich in Market place, although the Buffet was alright.

Maid service concerned me a bit - i made sure to zip up my luggage before we left for the day and when I came back my bag was wide open and my things were on the floor. They took my white towel out of my bag as well - it didn't look anything like the towels in the room. So that was frustrating. Luckily nothing else was missing - BUT - for some reason when we left there was a thong, pair of shorts and t-shirt in our room....none of which belonged to us. Still haven't figured that one out. The Venus Pool was amazing. Didn't like the main pools at all. Too crowded and too many kiddos. We got into Venus without having to pay the $25 cover both days, but it would have been worth it even if we had to. My roomate ate at a restaurant in Caesars and they tried to steal her money, so be careful about what they are charging you and if you get your change back. We also had issues with the bellhop - he forgot to put one of our bags in the cab on our way to the airport so we had to turn around and come all the way back.

After staying at Caesars a couple of years ago and being placed in a terrible smoky and old room in the Forum Tower we swore we will never come back. However, my company's annual conference this year was there and we were all guaranteed a Palace Tower room so I figured it couldn't be that bad. I was traveling with my brother this year so we had reserved a room with two beds. We arrived at the hotel around midnight due to major flight delays and were told that they did not have any more rooms with two beds but could put us in a king room for the first night and then move us to a double the next day. I was not very happy because I was going to be busy the entire day and did not want to deal with moving rooms, etc but the check-in clerk said he would upgrade us to a room at the Augustus Tower the next day and he told us it will be a high floor room with a view of the Strip to compensate for the inconvenience. We thought that was a great deal and agreed. The room in the Palace Tower where we spent our first night was renovated and really nice - flat screen TV, modern furniture and soft beds. The bathroom was huge, with a Jacuzzi tub, double sinks, marble and granite, very tasteful. The next day my brother moved our stuff to the new room in Augustus and when I got to the room in the evening I was not pleasantly surprised. The room was identical to the one we had in Palace although a bit larger and had a small sofa and coffee table by the window. The bathroom was also the same as in the Palace but had a small TV above the sink. Exact same furniture and decor as the Palace room. My surprise came when I looked through the window and instead of a lovely Strip view saw a construction site a few feet away from me. My annoyance grew when we were woken up around 4 am the next day when the construction crew began working and we could hear all the sounds loud and clear. I'm sure they \"upgraded\" us to this room because no one paying over $500 per night would accept that. The construction was pretty much non-stop between 4 am and about 4 pm every day so sleeping late was not an option unless you have ear plugs. The pool area is really nice but again, the new tower is being built right next to the pool so all the sights and sounds of building a 50-story tower are present at the pool. In addition the staff at the pool was rude and would not allow us to charge drinks to our room without an ID even though we offered our room key (we had charged many other things around the hotel on our room but the waitress at the pool would not let us buy a $10 drink). At the pool, the first row of chairs has a constant \"Reserved\" sign even though most of them sat empty. So not only do you have to pay $300+ per night to be at the hotel but you have to pay extra to get a chair right by the pool. We tried going to the Venus pool and were told we can only get in if we bought a cabana or sat at the bar (and spent money of course). You could see the pool was not full at all but they are trying to make it look like it's packed judging by all the security outside. They have also closed the entrance from the Augustus tower to the pool because of the construction so you have to make a 10-minute trek through the casino now. Again, the pool area is not bad but with all the construction and the snobby staff attitude it was just too much for me. The casino is just OK although after 8 pm all the tables have minimums of $25 or above (compared to the Bellagio and Mirage where they had plenty of $10 and $15 tables every night). also, at the slot machines at night it took forever to get a drink as the servers were not abundant. We played at several of the nearby casinos during the week and the service at Caesars was probably the worst. Then comes the problem with the Valet. Either their parking lot is tiny or they have a policy to say their valet is full for no reason because every single night we stayed there (7 nights) in the evenings they would put up a sign that the valet is full. When we mentioned we were guests they would take our car until our last night when they told us they only accept cars of Seven Diamonds members even though we are guests of the hotel. When we complained to the manager, he said he was sorry, they should have taken our car, but he did not offer any real resolution, he just looked like he did not want to deal with us. Then, we came to find out that Caesars is the only hotel where the Valet bears no responsibility for your car even if they damage it or it is stolen from their valet lot (just look at the valet ticket if you do not believe me). We checked all of the other valet tickets for the other hotels where we hung out and Caesars is the only one with such a ridiculous policy. In terms of restaurants and shopping - there are many options at Caesars for pretty much every taste so at least you won't be disappointed in that. We saw Elton John at the Colosseum - he was great and definitely worth the super expensive tickets ($300 pp). However, his run is over in a few weeks but I know Beth Middler and Cher are coming after him so if you like them, definitely see them, it's an experience to remember. So, overall, is it a bad hotel? No. Is it worth paying hundreds of dollars a night to be nickel and dimed for everything? NO! Is the Augustus tower worth the extra money? Absolutely no! But do not stay at the Roman or Centurion towers - one of my co-workers was put in the Roman tower and those rooms look worse than Motel 6, Caesars should be ashamed!", "Date": "June 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chico, CA", "Title": "\u201cAvoid Caesars Summer 2008\u201d", "Author": "ChicoGuy", "ReviewID": "UR17154384", "Content": "We booked a room in the Augustus Tower, but it was not available.

I had 10 people travel from all over the world to join me, and we all had a wonderful stay at Caesar's. Check-in was simple and easy, and most of us took the option of the upgrade. Having seen the rooms of those who did not take this option, I must say that I am glad we did. Our room was huge, with 2 queen sized beds, a double bathroom, jacuzzi bath, flat screen tvs (including one in the bathroom), and a view of the Bellagio fountains. We found out later that one of our party had been offered their upgrade at a lesser amount than we had been. When we raised this with the front desk they agreed instantly to drop our rate as well, which was very impressive. We ate at quite a few restaurants in the hotel and the Forum Shops. Hyakumi, the Sushi restaurant, was lovely, but beware that it is pricey. One problem is that in Las Vegas, the tips are expected to be at least 20% on top of relatively expensive food + tax, which means that it can appear that you are paying above the odds for what you get. But when in Rome ... We also ate at the Cheesecake Factory (yummy and huge portions ... when will they open one in London??) and Spagos (great food, great cocktails, excellent service). Cafe Lagos for breakfast was amazing! I have never seen such a massive and varied buffet in my life. I seem to remember that it is \u00a317.99 for all you can eat, and I strongly recommend doing this if you're looking to have a 2-meal day. I was stuffed all the way til dinner. Augustus Cafe was a good option for breakfast if you didn't want to gorge on an all-you-can-eat buffet, althought the service struggles when it is busy. It is also a good spot for a light bite during the day (I can highly recommend the Matzah Ball chicken soup). The Forum Shops are an excellent shopping venue. You will find all the usuals here, but be warned, things in Vegas are a little more expensive than in other places in the US. If you are prepared to pay (and have a good exchange rate), it is a great shopping experience. Other people have told me that the budget malls on the outskirts of town are great value if you're prepared to travel to them. We went to the Fashion Mall past Treasure Island and had a great time in there as well. As far as the casino goes, I would agree that it is smoky and appears a little run down in parts. However, every casino I walked into in Vegas was smoky, so until they catch up with the rest of the world and ban smoking indoors, you just have to live with it. The only exception to that was the Palazzo ... but until I win the lottery, I can't afford to stay there! Pure nightclub was a great deal of fun, once you got in. In Vegas, all of the best clubs are in the hotels and none of them seem to have any idea about how to control a queuing system. You get free entry with your hotel key but you still have to attack the bouncers with the same gusto as anyone else. Definitely worth going to for a boogy with your friends, but I hear the drink prices are a bit extravagant (we didn't bother trying to get near the bar). All in all, I spent an amazing 30th birthday in Vegas, and I like to think that staying at Caesar's played a part in that. The location in the centre of the strip is second to none - and was the reason I chose here rather than NY, NY or the MGM. Oh and the pool area is cool too - we spent a few afternoons lazing around, and even the food and drinks that they serve at \"Snackus Maximus\" were surprisingly good.

Caesars Palace was a treat\u2026.it was like staying at an Adult Disney Land. Check-in We arrived at around noonish and check-in is not until 3pm. So the hostess directed us to the Bell desk where we could check our bags for free. Everyone was quite friendly\u2026great start. We went for lunch and came back an hour later and they had a room ready. I booked the free room upgrade promotion through Travelocity (based on availability) and was quite worried I would not get the upgrade\u2026.again not a problem. The person at the front desk was very friendly and helped us pick our room (room 731 in the Palace Tower), a deluxe room!! Room The deluxe room was exactly as advertised from the reviews. King bed was amazingly comfortable and the room was very spacious. The bathroom was awesome \u2013 two sinks, modern standup shower, jetted whirl pool tub!! Room was non smoking and we could not smell any smoke in or around our room. Cleaning staff was consistent and had rooms cleaned by 2pm every day and did a great job. They were very friendly and even initiated conversations which I can say I have not seen in any other hotel. They supplied us with extra towels when we asked as well. Restaurants Ouch..talk about pricey!! This didn\u2019t both me too much as I had done my research and figured as much. However, if you are looking to have a cheap breakfast in the morning or a light/not so pricey lunch - forget about it. The Caf\u00e9 across from Rao\u2019s restaurant for two Tea\u2019s and two breakfast Sandwishes $25. The other restaurants we tried in the hotel were in the Forum Shops. We tried Spago, expensive, food was ok and service was not good at all and I would not recommend. Trevi is Italian and again expensive and ok, food was good but service was just average at best. Had a great steak dinner at Boa\u2019s Steakhouse (3rd floor of Shops). Service was amazing, atmosphere is not stuffy and is perfect for couples. We ordered four drinks, Oyster on the Half Shell, NY Strip, Petite Filet and our dinner was about $200. Well worth it!! Cheesecake Factory was nice as well and as you can imagine my wife loved the desserts!! Shopping Forum shops are entertaining but again are very expensive\u2026no deals or sale prices here. Great for people watching. We looked around for fun, but actually did our shopping at the Fashion Show mall and the Vegas Outlet Mall (South end of strip). Location PERFECT \u2013 There is no better located hotel on the strip. It is like they started with Caesars and built hotels on either end so it is perfectly placed in the middle. Pool Yes\u2026.its under construction but not once did any type of noise bother us and the pool area is still spectacular looking. They supply free towels and we went to the pool at various times of the day ranging from noon to 5pm and always found a good place to sit. Bars/Clubs We did Shadow bar and Pure within Caesars. Shadow Bar is nice and casual and they have topless dancers behind a screen so you can only see their shadow (thus the name)\u2026pretty entertaining, even my wife was amused!! Drinks were pretty pricey but not crazy at about $7 a beer. This is a low key sitdown place and not a place really to meet people or party. Pure was out of this world\u2026I am not much into the club scene these days, but this place was awesome. We purposely went on a Sunday night as Friday and Saturday night there were at least 400 people in line!! Also we went at around 8:30ish and we were given free passes so we didn\u2019t have to pay the crazy cover charge of $60 between the two of us. The club itself is on the roof of Caesars and the view is amazing, the music was also great and the people are hot!! Drinks are the most expensive I saw while in Vegas at $10-$12 a drink. We still had a great time!! Casino I am not much of a gambler at all. I prefer poker with a few friends rather than with strangers at a casino\u2026with that said we really just stuck to the slot machines. The casino itself I found quite smokey and uncomfortable. The min bets are pretty high at this hotel as well for the tables. Slots did not seem to have a huge variety. I did go to other Casino\u2019s on the strip and this is one area I believe that caesars is behind in as Bellagio was much nicer with better servers, more variety and more free drinks \uf04a Check-out Very painless as I used the automated TV check-out service\u2026.no lines no issues and they let you keep the room keys so you do not have to return those either.", "Date": "June 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cOnly Good Thing About Caesars Is The Location!\u201d", "Author": "Leasha", "ReviewID": "UR16890223", "Content": "Spent 4 nights at Caesars as part of our 3 week Honeymoon.

Let me first say that Vegas is not my thing, so perhaps that clouded my opinion some. However, there were some fundamental problems that need to be mentioned. The Rooms: Since we were not paying, we had been booked in the \"classic\" room by the travel agent used by our district. Just so everyone knows... \"classic\" means the cheapest and OLDEST room. The bathroom was o.k., but had some problems. It was quite large and was \"cleanish\". There was a separate shower and tub. The tile in both had a lot of mildew and was kind of gross. There was a little walled area for the toilet. On one of the walls it looked like someone had wiped blood or some kind of bodily fluid - yuck. The sink area was the cleanest part and had marble counter tops with good lighting and a newer sink and faucet. The beds were old and lumpy. There were FILTHY throw pillows and a comforter that didn't appear to have been washed since Caesar's time - Again, weird stuff wiped on the walls around the bed area. The ancient looking velour sofa had miscellaneous stains all over it. Lighting was poor with only three very dim lamps. During the day we could open the drapes for lighting, but at night it was difficult to see much. I think they built the walls with rice paper. Every night (three nights) from 1-3 a.m. we could hear our neighbors as they brought their party to the room. It was as though the party was actually in OUR room. There was yelling, banging on doors, and people coming and going constantly. I know this is Vegas, but I was appalled at the lack of consideration that others had. Some people do come to Vegas for more than just partying and do appreciate sleep. There was also loud thumping from music all night - possibly from the night club?? With all of the smoke from the casinos one would hope to, at least, have some respite while in the privacy of his/her room, but NOT here! We had reserved a non-smoking room. However, smoke was clearly embedded in every fiber of the room and it had that stale ashtray smell. The surrounding rooms must have been smoking rooms because several times we could smell the smoke as it wafted through the walls and under the doors - DISGUSTING! I just don't understand why some hotels think this is acceptable. Smoking rooms should NEVER be on the same floor as non-smoking rooms. The doors to the closet seemed like they were going to fall off of the wall each time we would open them. There was a large hole kicked in the wall too - classy. The safe looked like something from twenty years ago and they charge you to keep your things in it - just ridiculous. Houskeeping: We did not find any major problems with housekeeping. They restocked everything as needed and cleaned/mopped the bathroom floor daily. While they certainly need to do a good scrub down of the shower/tub, wash the bedding tops, and wipe the walls once in a while, they did a pretty thorough job overall with the basic stuff. The Common Areas: The casino is... well, a casino - smoky, dirty, and crowded. The conference areas were all very nice and had clean restrooms with people constantly touching up for cleanliness and restocking needed paper products. The forum shops were great and there were several good places to eat throughout the hotel (Spago, Mesa Grill, Cheesecake Factory, Chinese food by Wolfgang Puck, etc.). The pool area was nice, but the water looked cloudy and dirty. They have pool attendants and towels available for guests. Just note that the area surrounding the pool is under construction, so it is not the most serene of places. The pool closes at 7 p.m. This seems a little early to me, but I'm sure they have their reasons (Drunk people and water - not a good combination?) Checking in/out was fast and easy. They even let us leave our bags in our room past our checkout time until our conference ended. In sum, I was not happy with Caesar's Palace. If you don't mind smoky, dirty, old rooms with paper thin walls and you don't wish to sleep, then stay here in a \"classic\" room. If you care about fresh air, like to retreat to a clean, quiet room sans other people's left over body fluids, and you treasure a good night's rest, then find someplace else to rest your head.", "Date": "June 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairview, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cRomantic Stay at Caesars\u201d", "Author": "minniemoomoo", "ReviewID": "UR16829879", "Content": "We went for our 28th anniversary to hear Elton John and decided to stay at Caesars this time.

The pillows were fabulous, but the bed was a little stiff and hard. Not much cushion there. Also, our visits to the pool were very difficult. The hotel didn't seem to be that crowded, but the pool was overly crowded. All the chaises and chairs were full very early in the morning and many folks left because there wasn't any place to \"be\".

It was amazing. Can't wait to do it again. The suite is huge, 2 story, Here is a video link for the suite. [--] There are 6 areas- When you walk in the door you are in the Mandarin area. It has a bar, with every flavor of vodka stocked, entry way and bath. Off to the right is the Ruby Red Bedroom. The best in my opinion. The bathroom is amazing, jacuzzi tub, bidet and all. There are 3 closets in the room. All rooms have flat screens and electric blinds with different scences. Each room is also a good size. We had extra cots placed in many of the rooms to fit extra friends. Plenty of room. Of course all the bedrooms have their own baths. To the left is the Vanilla Room. It is the least impressive, but very comfy to stay in. I believe you can rent just this room because there was a door out to the hallway and double doors to lock from the room to the suite. Past this is the Rasberry party area. It is 2 storys, dance floor on the main level, we even had a karaoke machine. Tons of seating, then another bar on the upper level. We referred to this as the VIP lounge. Upstairs there is the Citron room. My least favorite because of the supper bright yellow walls. Other than that, the room is just as nice as the Ruby Red room. Also upstairs is the Peach room. Really fun. Jacuzzi tub right in the room. It looks like the room is water, and the bed is a raft in the middle of the room. I also believe you can rent this room out by itself because of the double doors and exit to the hall. You may also be able to rent out the suite as 2 bedroom. It really was the perfect party pad. The service was amazing. The only negative to the suite was there isn't any comfortable seating. There is lots of seating, but none of it was comfortable. The party was going all day and night, since we had so many people, some went to bed when others were just waking up, but once you closed the bedroom door, you couldn't hear anything. It isn't a cheap place to stay, but we actually spent less money than normal for us in Vegas, because it was like we had our own personel club, no need to leave.

Here's hopefully a balanced review: First,the trip from the airport to the hotel. There are numerous options to get you from the Airport to the hotel, including shuttles, limos, and cab rides. A cab ride will take about 20 mins (depending on traffic) and cost about $20. A limo takes about the same amount of time, but costs around $65. Shuttles run frequently to the hotes, and these will cost you $6 to $8. I chose the shuttle. The shuttle was clean and the driver was nice, however I ended up being the last stop and so the ride took nearly 1.5 hours! My suggestion is to check the order of dropoff and decide then whether a shuttle is in order. Once I arrived at the hotel, it was of course extravagant with Roman statues and gold leaf on the walls. Since this is a casino, all traffic is guided thru the gaming area. So to get from one part of the hotel to the other requires that you walk through the actual casino. Upon entering, I was hit by a wall of cigarette smoke. If you've never been to Vegas, and don't smoke, you're in for a shock. Many of the smoke-free casino areas that were introduced years ago have closed. When you gamble, you will be engulfed in smoke smell, will breathe tons of second hand smoke and your clothes will stink of smoke. Bring a bag to seal your clothes in so that they do not make the rest of your suitcase smell. Also, gamble early in the morning to avoid the strongest smoke. In Caear's case, while standing in the check in (which is near the casino), you begin to be inundated with smoke smell. Note: there are some casino's like the Paris or the Venice that try everything from huge filtration systems to perfume smells to reduce the smoke in the casino. They have varying degrees of success. Construction alert!: the hotel is undergoing massive expansion by adding another tower to the property. Starting at about 9am until late afternoon, you will hear the construction going on. This also overlooks the pool area - which makes it less attractive and cluttered. Try to ask for a room facing the strip so that you do not hear the noise. The line at check-in was long. It took 30 mins to make it to the desk. The desk person was friendly and gave me good directions to my room. The hotel has a number of \"towers\" located at different corners, connected by the Casino. There are also nice shops and a mall (the Forum) adjscent to the Palace. I was in the Palace Tower, on the 7th floor. There's a walk way over the main road that's easy to use. Most of the roads on the strip now have metal barries that keep people from jay-walking. The room itself is comparable to other Vegas rooms - which means it's fairly large. My room had two full bathrooms and a large shower with two shower heads. There a separate vanity and a Roman Tub (what else?) with jets. Warning - when taking a shower, if you turn on the water full blast, the bathroom floor fills with water. The room itself is in average condition. It was worn in places, the roof in the shower had a large dark water stain, the shower has some mold in it, etc. (see my attached pictures) There's a bidet (sic?) in one of the toilet stalls. There is a desk for your laptop, a sofa couch, table and chair. The King Size bed was comfortable. There's a wetbar absolutely crammed with snacks, champagne, etc. - all of which are expensive, of course. There's a small Sony flatscreen TV with few free channels on it and lots of pay channels. After all, they want you in the Casino and not watching movies in your room! There's an ironing board and a very small safe. I'm used to safes large enough to put a laptop computer in. This safe was about 6 inches by 3 inches by 4 inches (cube). There's tons of closet space. The room has wired and wirelss Internet, but it's $20/day. There is no coffee maker in the room. Room Service was prompt and courteous, the food was reasonably tasty but very expensive. French Onion Soup with Iced Tea cost $31. Three-cup caraffe of coffee with a bowl of cereal, glass of orange juice was $34. The room itself and the hallway did not smell of smoke thankfully. It was very quiet; I couldn't hear anyone around me and surprisingly the halls are quiet at night. You do not get a newspaper each day, nor do you get a printout of your hotel bell the last night; you must get that from the checkout area. There is a Spa, which supposedly includes a fantastic fitness center with virtual cycling and a rock climbing wall. However, this costs $20/day and there's no free mini fitness center. The pool is free, however, but from what I could see, it was fairly crowded with sunbathers (and few swimmers). There are no kids at this hotel. Kids are not allowed near the gambling area and will be asked to \"move on\" if seen loitering or pausing (even if the parent is doing a quick pull of the slot machine). Plus I don't know if I would want my kid sucking down tons of second hand smoke. One odd thing - the alarm clock is insanely complicated to use. No instructions - so it took me 20 minutes to figure out how to use it - and how to dim it at night. The rooms are not serviced until very late afternoon, so if you leave in the morning in hopes of returning to a fresh room to clean up (from the smoke!) at 2pm, you'll be met with the same mess you left. You can call for a sooner cleanup, and they will clean your room, but in my case it caused confusion and a second maid service showed up, who insisted that the room had not been cleaned (despite me showing her that it had!) The casino staff was friendly and courteous (as expected) and patiently explain the various betting rules. There are many tables with only a $10 minimum. In summary, the hotel was above average. There are just so many newer, nicer resorts in Las Vegas that Caesar's is starting to lose its luster. If you've never been to another Vegas hotel, you'll likely be floored by Caesar's. But if you've been to the Bellagio, the Paris, etc. you'll find it \"okay\". End Note: I just read the previous review that was posted about a stay around the same time as this stay. Wow! I'm not surprised because you could sort of tell that Caesar's is slowly on the way down hill. I left my laptop in my room (hidden) one day - and thankfully it was not stolen.

At 4:40 p.m., no message was received. Called to find out the status and was told our room was, indeed, ready. We never did receive notification via text message to our cell phone. Needless to say, we were quite peeved that no room was ready at 3:30 p.m. and believe that this is unacceptable practice. We have stayed in Vegas numerous times for special occasions or just a quick getaway ... never have we encountered a room not being available by 3:30 p.m. on check-in no matter where we stayed. Also when we checked in I reminded the person that it was my husband's birthday we were celebrating with them. Her response was \"what do you plan to do?\" That's it! As for the room, once in, one could say it was quite large. Ours was located in the Centurion Tower. However, it was less than impressive. The walls were very bare and it was sparsely decorated. One lamp shade was torn and well worn as were the drapes. The carpets were very thin and badly stained. Although the bathroom was large, it was again unimpressive. There was a significant amount of mold in the shower and in the corners on the floor. Yuk! The toilet ran often and we finally had to call for someone to come and stop it. When people flushed toilets or took showers in other rooms or on other floors, the pipes in the walls were so noisy they woke me up several times during the night! As for food ... stay away from the Agustus Cafe. The service is painfully slow and woefully inadequate. Although someone comes to take your drink order right away, the wait staff responsible for taking your actual food order can take up to 20 minutes to show up and actually take the order. Then it's another 20 minutes before the food actually arrives. I'm not sure whether they have to go to another casino or restaurant for the food or what! The restaurant itself is also horribly overpriced for what you get, but then that seems to be the norm for Vegas nowadays. If you can find another place to get breakfast or a late night snack I suggest you do so. Aside from that our stay was quite pleasant. If you can, take in a meal at Mon Ami Gabi at the Paris hotel ... fabulous as always. Also, Spago's is quite good in the Forum Shop area.

MESA great food, expensive. Joes Crab house, great food, expensive. Stage Deli (Forum shops) great breakfast and HUGE sandwiches, reasonable. Also great Clam chowder at the Forum food court, reasonable.", "Date": "May 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buna, TX", "Title": "\u201cDidn't like it\u201d", "Author": "bunatexas", "ReviewID": "UR15940142", "Content": "We went to Caesars for a conference.

When we got there I ordered a bud light and a margarita at the bar and I think it was $22 with a $2 dollar tip ! I dont know the break down but I think the beer was $8.00 and the Margarita $12.00 I think this is a bit over the top caesers !!! You are not hurting for money can we at least get a 5 dollar beer ??? This continued throught the entire strip ( not just caesers ) and really annoyed me these casinos just cant get enough of our money !! At some point it makes the trip less enjoyable ! THE TABLES at ceasers !!!! WAY TO HIGH LIMIT ----- If you are not brining $10,000 or more dont expect to gamble here . The minimum Craps at night is like$50 dollars so if you have a passline , backup pass and cover the numbers you have got like $300 on the table every second . unless you are hitting points all night long your losing about 1800 and hour ! we gambled at Ballys and Planet ! I found the same thing in blackjack and three card poker ! It was just to high for us and we usually play $10 to $25 dollar tables . If you are going to put $300 on a table you need a host ! Roulette was a $10 minumium at some times but who wants to play that boring game all night ! Venus pool - would not let us in ! the dorky doorman checked me and my wifes id asked us if we wanted a cabana or couch ( which range from $600 to $1500 dollars ) . We said we would just like a seat and he then said they were all full for the day ! I could see they were not full from where I was standing ! And if they were full why did he make us wait in line and why did he check our id ... We were only going to venus for seting and music not nudity . I live in miami I can go to south beach if I want nudity . Seemed like just a money scam ! We then went to the regular pool and it was way to crowded . probably because they want money for the venus pool so everyone goes to regular pool ! Tip to Caesers if your ging to have a hotel with 5000 rooms dont have a pool with 500 chairs ! other than that the pool was good - I got into a showdown with the towel girl because she said that we were only allowed one towel per person and because I went to get both and only had one hotel key i could not have 2 .

Asked at reception if we could pay the extra to be upgraded and was told that this had now gone up to $120 and it wouldn't be with any kind of view. When i said that we had only been offered the original upgrade 5-10 minutes ago, the Receptionist said it must have gone!!!!!!

We have stayed at many different hotels in Vegas since we have gone to Vegas at least once a year most of our lives. I had heard about the fact that some rooms are in need of redecorating but our room in the Palace tower on the 25th floor was absolutely beautiful. New modern decor with 42\" LCD TV. The bathroom was beautiful with jacuzzi bathtub and large walk-in shower. Double sinks with separate toilet room (with a phone). The lobby was pretty empty when we checked in late Sunday afternoon (which was nice). The staff was courteous. The only thing I wish I would have researched was the fact that construction IS going on there. We didn't hear any noise at all on Sunday, but by Monday morning, we woke up to pounding and jackhammer type hoises above our heads. Not a nice thing when you want to sleep in from being up late the night before. Our room overlooked the pools and we could see that a new tower is being built on the other side, but it sounded like work was being done on the floor above us. As we left to go home, we could see crane type things on the roof. Niiiice. We didn't spend much time in the room after that until we came back to get ready to go to Phantom. More noises the next morning. The only problem was with one of the sinks in the bathroom. I couldn't turn on the cold water faucet. It just spun around and round. Makes you wonder why the maid didn't notice this when she was cleaning the bathroom? I finally spun it around counter-clockwise and got it to tighten up. But every so often, you'd turn on the water and then couldn't turn it off.......it would just start spinning around again. Later that night I could hear the drain making a glub-glub noise. Finally the water wouldn't drain out. So this was on the last night of our stay. I'm sure if I would have called, they would have fixed it, but since there was another sink to use and I really didn't want them to come in while we were relaxing, I left a note when we left *LOL*.

Our room was located in the Palace Tower, which was quite a walk from the main entrances, but it was worth it. Plus it was directly in front of the pool so we didn't have to walk through the hotel/casino in our swimsuits! We stayed on the 17th floor and had a great view of the pool area. Our rooms were good sized with plenty of room to move around and not feel cramped. The bathroom was very large with a separate room for the lou. The shower and the tub were separated and we had a jaccuzzi tub (which was awesome) and a double sink in the bathroom (that came majorly in handy). The beds were very comfortable from the mattress to the pillows and bedding. Everything about the room was clean, minus the floor could have used another vacuuming.

The wait staff was very friendly and the pool grounds and pool itself was very clean. We went to the pool around 10 each morning and there were very few to no children in the pool, so it stayed pretty quiet. The pool snack shop \"Snackus Maximus\" was reasonably priced and included a wide variety of foods for different palates. The only bad thing about the pool was the fact that the hotel is building another tower and you can watch the construction from the pool (and hear it).

The facilities were very clean and the service was friendly and helpful. The casino off of the lobby was small in comparison to some of the other hotels, but if you were fortunate enough to explore the entirety of the hotel, there was another casino that was much larger and nicer toward the Forum Shops (which were impeccable). The restaurants in the casino were very nice and there was a wide variety. We ate at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grille and was very pleased. The club PURE that was in the casino was very pretty, but very small compared to the others.

I was attending a medical conference while they came along for shopping and fun. The good things about this hotel were the prime location on the strip, and excellent service. Everyone was friendly, from the front desk, to the sales clerks at the stores and business center. Our room was quite clean. It was a good size, and the bed was comfortable. Pool was beautiful, and not very crowded (it was too cold for swimming). Nice palm trees and sculptures. Facilities at the conference were fantastic; good food and coffee, plenty of bathrooms, nice display area, ample seating and tables, good lighting and tech support. Downsides: everything smelled like smoke, including the casino, and the hallways in our tower. Our room was a non smoking room but still had reeked of cigarettes. I think we were staying in the older part of the hotel (centurion tower). There was a shabby red velvet couch that probably retained the cigarette smell. The walls were very thin and I could hear toilets flushing and people showering on either side of my bathroom as well as other activities. There were doors slamming open and closed all night, and people yelling up and down the hallway. in the middle of the night (probably drunk). Every single night! On thursday night there was a live band playing somewhere and although I was on floor 31 (actually it was probably the fifth floor or so) and wearing earplugs it was still so loud I couldn't sleep. I complained and the music stopped shortly afterwards but this was probably a coincidence. I had been offered an upgraded room at the time of check in and this would have cost an extra $80 a day. I refused at the time but iin retrospect this might have been a good idea. Even with the conference rate I was still paying over $200 a night but the room certainly was not worth it. One of my colleagues who arrived later to the conference was upgraded (initially he was told to pay the $80, but then given the room for the same conference rate as there were no more of our oom type available). He was put in the augustus tower and said this was much nicer, didn't smell of smoke, and he had a flat screen tv. Nor did he notice any loud music or slamming doors. The other downside of this hotel is that there was not wireless internet access. It cost $11 a day to have internet access in the rooms and I had forgotten my laptop so I used the computers in the business center which is only open till 6 pm on weekdays and charges about $1 a minute for internet, which is a bit ridiculous. There was some fellow who wanted to send an urgent fax to europe and was told it would cost $12! There is no internet cafe nearby although i saw one about four hotels down on the strip near the hawaiian marketplace (past planet hollywood). It probably would have been a good idea to go there instead, if you have the time and don't mind walking a few blocks. Needless to say, I will not be staying at this hotel again. It would be fine if you were going to have a wild party weekend and didn't care if you were going to get sleep or not.

We stayed in the Augustus tower. I think that is the newest one. The rooms are exactly what I look for: quiet, spotlessly clean (don't you hate those hotels where you don't feel comfortable to sit on any piece of furniture?), tastefully furnished, a beautifully tiled, large bathroom with separate w.c. and a great shower (I want that shower head!!!); a terrific bed with soft sheets with no tears, spots, and tatters, thank you, fluffy towels in the bathroom with no hint of weird smells, a flat screen TV with a good range of pay programs, and a terrific view of the Strip. The only bad mark was a slightly long wait for the luggage to get to the room. Caesars Palace is perfectly centered on the busiest part of the Vegas Strip. Even if you want to go to Mandalay Bay, you can walk just across the street to the monorail at Bally's or Harrah's. The restaurant selection is great. I liked my meal at 808 Pacific Seafood best (6 appetizer taster to start, scallops for the 'main'). The flight of 3 sakes started the evening just right. Guy Savoy is truly top notch and has my highest marks for impeccable service and many amazingly flavourful dishes, but, unfortunately, I cannot recommend the D\u00e9gustation Menu, \"an epic culinary journey spanning ten amazing courses\". There were too many rich courses. It was amazing for the first 5 courses, but then became overwhelming. I wish we had had the TGV Menu which would have been more reasonable. You don't want to overdo a good thing like the cuisine of Guy Savoy. I'd love to go back for an evening of less excess. We did not get to the buffet, but we heard it was terrific. The cafe off the lobby of the Augustus tower has a great Club sandwich. For gamblers, Caesars is part of Harrahs group with about 7 or 8 other Vegas casinos, so you can wander and still build up those comps. The casino is hard to beat. It is such a contrast to the casinos where you have to wonder when they last vacuumed or how many decades it was since they last changed their carpeting (like Treasure Island). No such concerns with Caesars. It is a huge casino (2 actually), so you can spend a lot of time checking out all the different areas. The Forum Shops are a shoppers wonderland.

When I arrived, I declined the offer of a paid upgrade and they put me in the Centurion tower. The bed was terribly hard, with only a thin blanket on it. The mattress pad I requested never arrived. The room had a plush velvet couch that I liked, but otherwise the room was nondescript, with a needlessly large bathroom (what, am I supposed to do gymnastics in there or something??). The biggest problem was that the room was terribly humid. When I turned on the air conditioning to dry out the air, the room got cold. Those were my options: dank or freezing. One of the three elevators serving the Centurion tower had broken down, and then the next day, all three elevators were out of service -- guests were being ferried up and down in a freight elevator. I went down to the front desk and literally begged them to put me in a different tower. Eventually the clerk took pity on me and gave me the one room she said was available in the Palace Tower. It was a \"smoking optional\" room (huh), and when I got up there, it was clear that the previous occupant had opted to chain-smoke for their entire visit. The smell was dizzying. But other than that, the room was great -- a jacuzzi; bathrobes; an LCD TV (not high-def, unfortunately); and a wonderful bed piled high with a down comforter and fluffy pillows. I slept like a baby for the rest of my stay and soaked in the jacuzzi every night. The floor I stayed on was served by six fast elevators that were actually in service.

We stayed in a classic corner room for about $200 a night. 1. Service ranged from poor to great. Room service was very quick and professional. Maid service was a little slow to get to our room. But it was explained to me that they do the rooms that will have new guests first. I can appreciate that. See Restaurants below for more detail. 2. Food was excellent. Again room service food was great. Still arrived warm/hot. Quality was extraordinary for a big strip hotel, any hotel for that matter. Would recommend it at least once. 3. Room was nice, decor was pleasant and fit the theme, bathroom was not a surprise but not a disappointment. If you go to Vegas for a bathroom impression then you'll probably always be disappointed unless staying in one of the suites. We did like the MOEN shower head so much we bought one when we got home. 4. Slots, because we didn't lose any money. 5. Restaurants. We went to Nero's and Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill. We loved the Mesa Grill food and flavors. We liked Nero's but I think we felt we overpaid for the food. Service at Mesa Grill was an 11 out of 10. It was that good. I could go on all day about their food. They have one of the top pastry/desert chefs in the world, the special creation she created for the day we were there was absolutely fabulous. I had a steak with yam side dish, both were just to die for. My wife had a cioppino soup, that was tasty as well. Nero's on the other hand was quite different. We wish we had gone to Mesa Grill again after the experience at Nero's. The service at Nero was Zero. They bumbled around us like we were in the way. Our table was off balance so it would rock a little. That's a little weird to be honest. If you pay over $50 for an entree, you would think they could make the table not rock? They had a problem at the end with getting our check so we had to wait another 10 minutes for that. There was a table of 10 that got all the attention of course. Since we were just 2 of us. Bottom line, I give Nero a 5 out of 10. Quality of food was alright, service and experience did not match price. BTW, we almost ate at Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, but didn't like the menu. Yes that's right. Didn't like the menu. So we headed over to Mesa Grill and never regretted it. 6. Shops. We had been through the forum shops before but when you stay at the Caesar's Palace you appreciate them a little more when you can just walk down from your room. I'm curious how the new Hotel next to Venetian will impact Caesar's though. The forum shops still seem to be the place to go. Although we did find some things at Planet Hollywood shops we didn't find at Forum shops. Different crowd too. 7. Location. your feet will thank you. Things that bugged us. 1. The bed. The bed was extremely hard. My wife had a tough first night so I called and asked for another room. They could only offer a mattress pad. This took a couple of more follow up calls but finally got it. However, they didn't have a king size, only a queen or full, I can't remember. I just remember the king turned into a smaller bed from the width of the mattress pad. Shame on Caeser's. 2. View outside from inside. I felt caged in like an animal. There was some decorative bars going across all our windows which was a little distraction, not too bad to make me move once we looked at them from outside. However, I did feel like a monkey in a cage. 3. Casino. There is a lack of different slots and newer ones at that. They need to do something about this. We spent gambling time at Belagio and Venetian. Both feel more upbeat and have better slot variety. And we won at Belagio! Other things to recommend. 1. Wayne Brady Show at Venetian. Not sure how long this was going to be showing but he is A) really talented and B) really entertaining, Oh did I mention he's really talented and entertaining? Paid about $100 a ticket, sat on right side up front. I would recommend sitting in front 15 rows. The very back of the theater looked a little disconnected from the show. I would obviously try and sit center if you can. We still had a good time though. Other things to avoid. 1. Wynn buffett. Overpriced, and overpriced. Quality alright. Didn't impress. We paid $75 for two for their holiday buffett. What a rip off it was. Long line. The chefs looked depressed like they were imprisoned slaves. Are you paying them enough or what's the deal? Sorry Wynn but you won't be getting anymore money from me in your fake Belagio hotel. 2. Summer time. You can walk around a lot easier in the cold than you can in the 100+ heat. There's just no pools open ;-) Bottom line: 1. I would stay at Caesar's Palace again but I would try another tower and room. 2. I will only eat at Mesa Grill for dinner.

The room was nice, not incredibly big but modern. I have big gripes and felt the hotel stay to be very disappointing. 1. Three words: Roach in oatmeal. -- at breakfast in the Augustus cafe, the 24 hour restaurant off the main lobby area. After alerting the wait staff of the discovery, chef came out and claimed that the red pair of legs was actually a rare herb that happened to fall into the oatmeal. expand and then turn red upon heating. Insulting? just a little. The waitstaff then proceeded to charge me for the meal. I complained and the oatmeal was taken off the bill, however, still charged for rest of the meal. I had to speak with the cusomer service manager of the hotel about the incident and they eventually removed the charge for the meal. Are things that bad these days that the hotel staff would not think to do this for me initially? And as if that wasn't enough... 2. Check in marathon: We arrived late morning and I did not expect to get a room right away. I asked for a paid upgrade in the Augustus tower (smart move) after reading reviews on this site and I was not surprised when the front desk staff told me that the room was not available yet. The staff offered to text me when the room was available which seemed reasonable. 4 hours without a text go by and we approach the same front desk staff member who apologizes, tells us that she \"gave our room away\" and then assigns us a new room on a higher floor. Would have loved that text message... after a night's stay I can only infer why there is a lag in the room assignment. We came back to our room in the early evening the following day and found our housekeeper was waiitng out in the hallway for about 20 minutes for a manager to assign her to rooms to be cleaned. Seems as if our housekeeper was on time but the middle manager was just someplace else....probably trying to walk the mile and a half it takes to get to rooms on the other side of the property. 3. Upon reaching our room, we call the bellmen for our bags to be delivered. The response on the phone...\"this is the first time you called, right?\" Enough said. 4. Flakey concierge -- Before we finish speaking to the concierge she is already speaking to the next person in line. This is after they inform us that they charge 5 dollars to print out your boarding pass for your flight the next day. That was not advertised anywhere in the hotel or online (after we paid 18.95 for 24 hours of internet service). The room itself , the only saving grace, was comfortable but it felt lived in. Two light bulbs needed to be replaced, there were personal notes on the desk from the last visitor. The entire stay made me feel like a goat rather than an emperor. customer service non-existent, housekeeping spotty, and the property seems to be too big for the management to do their job appropriately. The hotel reminded me of a bad airline: sure they put a roof over your head for a ridiculous price and then charge you little things here and there for a less than mediocre experience. Honestly, I would not stay here again if someone paid me. I have been to Vegas once before and stayed at the Venetian. If you can afford it, I would go there. If you can't afford it, save your money and go to the Venetian when you can. I felt that this was a 2 or 3 star hotel in a 4 star shell.

Before the Bellagio, the Venetian and the Wynn, Caesars was considered the premier property on the strip. Even today, on first appearance, you might believe this to be the case. They house the only 3-star Michelin restaurant in town (Guy Savoy), and Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill as well as Bradley Ogden aren't slackers as 2-star Michelin restaurants, but that is not where the problems lie. The problem started with the reception. I had booked on-line using the convention rate of $178.00/night before tax. The young man who greeted us at reception area did a quick up-sell on us to convince us we could, for a modest increase of $50.00 a night, get a far better room in the newest tower, Augustus. Since my wife was with me, I agreed. What apparently this used car salesman.....errr, reception dude, forgot to mention was that the room was on the fifth floor overlooking the construction site of the even newer tower they are in the process of building. And that construction starts at 6:00 am \"to minimize the inconvenience for our patrons.\" After we discovered the problem, my wife said not to make a big deal about it. And I didn't. But I burned for three days thinking that this guy was no better than a barker at the carnival trying to get me to buy three darts for $1.00 to win my girl a teddy bear. The room was over-sized but not a suite. The bathroom was plush with dual sinks, walk-in shower and jacuzzi tub but that stuff is pretty standard nowadays. Yeah, a flat screen TV in the bathroom and a phone in the toilet stall but how did those things overcome the noise and view of the construction site just below, overlooking the 15 Freeway? Thirty years ago, when Caesar's Palace was a palace, I couldn't afford it. But I am betting back then if you booked at Caesar's they treated you like royalty.

Our room was at the end of the hallway and we had a buzzing noise 24/7 which may have been the airconditioning motor. I didn't feel at all like I was staying in a plush hotel.

I booked online for a standard king room and it was a pretty good deal, or so I thought. I guess I expected too much. The room was very ordinary and disappointing. It was definitely not something I expected from a prominent and classy hotel like the Casears. I know it's just a standard room, nevertheless, it could have been a lot better. Unfortunately, or should I say, fortunately, on our first night, an untoward incident happened, which later on turned out to be an advantage for us. We can\u2019t get into our room. There was something that was blocking the lock from inside. Housekeeping was not able to open it either and had to call the hotel\u2019s locksmith. We were pretty tired and the last thing we wanted to do was stand outside and wait. An idea suddenly popped up. I went to the front desk and (politely)complained and asked if we can be compensated for the inconvenience at least by giving us a free upgrade. The front desk gentleman spoke to his supervisor and after a brief discussion went back to me and agreed. This time it was a much better room, bigger, nicer, equipped w/ a plasma TV, and a huge jacuzzi tub. So in a nutshell, although we were disappointed at first, we were definitely pleased at how accommodating and considerate the staff were which totally made up for the inconvenience and frustration.", "Date": "December 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at Caesars\u201d", "Author": "big_D123", "ReviewID": "UR11993311", "Content": "Stayed at Caesars Palace over Christmas (Dec 22 - Dec 25).

When I complained and asked what happened to the reservation for the Augustus Tower (which still showed on-line that morning), I was told that \" I didn't read the fine print and they have the right to change rooms without notice.\" The room they put us in had peeling wallpaper, you had to literally walk into the bathroom to get in or out of the room (due to the room's entrance design), there was no guard around the door handle on the back of the bathroom door (got a cut on my hand). And, the view on the 30th floor was a view of a bunch of construction junk on the adjoining tower. The check in staff told us they had a lot of high rollers in for the National Finals Rodeo and a Harrahs Total Rewards Event called the Great Gift Wrap Up, and we simply didn't gamble enough to avoid getting bumped to what even the check in staff agreed was not one of their \" better \" rooms. They were extremely dismissive of our concern. They just didn't care. We ended up refusing to stay at Caesars Palace. My wife did not want to spend a penny there -- now or ever.

It was a bit intimidating pulling up in front of the hotel ( I rented a car which was the best for getting around the city) but the valet quickly handled things and my luggage was whisked way to await my call. Check-in was great and the clerk upgraded me to a wonderful room in the Palace tower (much nicer the standard room booked with the convention agency). No charge- I just asked nicely-two others checking in next to me both demanded an upgrade and received one-for $80 per night. Pays to be nice to folks in my opinion. Room was impeccably clean and the bathroom over the top. I was a little small for the tub but loved it nevertheless. I was surprised at how reasonable room service was and the food was good. Everything about Caesars is over the top. I can't help but laugh at the \"elegant\" shops and patina of \"class\" on this grand ole dame of a gambling hall. But it did spoil me. I ventured out a couple of times to other casinos (across the street to the Flamingo, Planet Hollywood, Bills and drive to Rio) and must say...I got back to Caesars as fast as I could! Being a woman travelling alone I certainly felt the safest there. The staff was so nice and over the few days began to recognize me and went out of their way to be helpful. I was turned off very late at night when I wandered downstairs and found a little bit of a rowdier crowd. They were a rougher bunch-young and blingy-and it was the only time I saw the casino look dirty, ashtrays overlfowing, empty drinks, etc. Parking was easy and I preferred the Palace tower as it let right down to the gorgeous pool area. Quieter at night as well. Beautiful view of the strip and mountains. The whole experience was a bit surreal and after two days home, I am still not sure what I think of Sin City. I am no prude but it all seemed a little sad underneath the glitter...but I sure had a blast riding down the strip in my little yellow PT cruiser convertible feeling like I knew where I was going (not a clue- got lost but finally figured out things the day before I left)> The Rio was pumped up quite a bit but the crowd was a bit rowdier and atmosphere was not so much hip as advertised but crazed. So, I guess I was spoiled by the fancy-fake of CP. If one is ever going to go to Vegas this would be the place to stay, at least once. Make a day trip out to Mount Charleston-10,000 feet up and the temp dropped 20 degrees. It only took 30-45 minute ride to get there and wow, it was something to see. Everyone raved about the lodge near the peak which really was kind of crappy to be honest, but it had a great view and always has a fire going in the middle of the place. I sat on the patio and pondered how I had managed to land up on top of mountain with barely a sound around me after the chaos of Vegas. It was funny listening to other folks there complaining about it being too quiet on the mountain and that there was nothing to \"do or see\" on the mountain. Oh well, some folks need disney all the time. It was a welcome break for me. Do not be afraid to ask for deals at the hotel and definitely ask the staff for tips on where to go around the city. The bellhop is the one who gave me directions to the mountain. Another filled me in on where Marshalls and TJ Maxx where (ahem, stores where I can actually afford to purchase more than a key fob...the shops in the hotels are rather over the top...but I swear I will one day own a pair of Christian Laboutin shoes!-Although if I had not become a penny slot addict I figure I could have bought at least one pair and still had some change left over:) Forget the buffets-they were all bad (at least at Flamingo and Rio). The Bellagio is supposed to have a good one but I don't believe it. Buffet food just doesn't work.

Forget about the 14.95 steak dinner at bill's across the street from caesars///a sad little dank place and a nasty meal. If you need cash for heaven's sake do not use ATMs-$4.95 per pop.

Room was located at Palace towers, overlooking the pools. Room was very comfortable and the very clean. The decor made it luxurious. Two slight downsides were: the tub and TV. The two person tub as I concurred with the previous posts is not that comfortable. The jets were not at the right spots and I have been in better tubs. But I didn't go to CP to lay in tubs. The flat screen TV wasn't all that sharp in watching some TV but watching my friends' TV the other tower, it was better and sharper but I didn't care as I just watch 15-20 minutes of TV to catch the news. The hotel service was impeccable. The dealers at the Casino were awesome as I have nothing bad to say. I like the airy and spacing environment CP offers at the casino. They treated me with a lot of professionism and class. They greeted you with kindness and smile. I was very comfortable at the pool and find it relaxing and enjoyable. It will be interesting when CP builds the new Tower in the next year and how much it block the sun. The barmaid service was very slow and had to walk to the bar several times to get drinks myself. What made CP stand out as it has all the amenitities (shops, entertainment, pool, casino, restaurants and nightclub) and is probably at the prime location on the strip. Very conveinence to North or South side of the strip where you get to experience all of the actions outside of CP. With 10-15 minutes walking distance to Venetian (North) and 15-20 minutes to NYNY (south) Honestly I think I would try staying at the Augustus Towers next time for the view of the strip.

Great location on the strip. A few pointers for you if you care: 1) Taxi from the airport, beware, if they ask you if you have ever been before say YES, if not they take the loooonnnngggg way costing $28.00 instead of what it should cost $14-$16.00, depending on traffic. Caesers Palace is very close to the airport. To think I even tipped him on top of it, makes me sick. As soon as you leave the airport make sure they don't go under the bridge, it's a big scam. We found this out when we left to back to the airport. Our cab driver told us it's a scam many of the drivers unfortunately pull. 2) Use the bus system. It's cheap for a day pass. $5.oo for 24 hours. You can ride it all day as much as you want. Street by street. Save your feet and legs, by the 3rd day it all really catches up to you. Besides, lots of great characters on the bus, great fun. Unfortunately we weren't aware of this till the last day. By the 3rd day I could hardly walk. The tram is neat but takes so long to get to it. It's $5.00 for one trip or $9.00 for the day. 3) Dress comfortably. Shoes especially. So many girls wearing heels. I haven't a clue how they managed. Their feet must of been killing them. Anything goes in Vegas, so go comfortably, you will be happy you did !! 4)Take the bus down to Freemont st. in the evening. This is the oldest part of Vegas. The largest tv screen you would ever see is above you covering a full city block. Very cool, light show with music. Lots of shopping for cheap souvenirs also. Worth the tour for sure. 5) David Copperfield- So Cheesy !!! $100.00 per person and was the worst show I had ever seen. Unfortunately this was the only show we took in. We didn't have enough time for everything. A 1 and 1/2 hour show. A 20 minute video to start (very boring) but a great filler for him I guess. It seemed to go on and on. Then he picks all of the big busted bimbos wearing mini skirts he can find for his props. Too many stupid jokes and not enough magic which is what we came to see. I believe he was once very good, now he is flying by his name, certainly not his show. A real dissapointment and waste of money. We were told the Cirque shows are amazing. I wished we had gone to one of those instead. All in all we had a great time. So much to see. Free things to see at all of the hotels but you need to search these out. Ask around, people will tell you where they are. -Our room was in the Forum tower. King size bed (the mirror above was pretty cheesy too). 2 person Jacuzzi tub in the bedroom. Nice marble bathroom. The room was quite old but clean. We were asked to upgrade but chose not too. An extra 80.00 per night. ahhh, we didn't even use the tub. There is no time for that. Too much to see.

When we arrived at Caesars we had booked a basic room and were offered an upgrade to an Augustus Tower room for an extra $100 per night. We said ok. We got up to the room and it was nice and big with a good view but was still sort of small and we couldn't take the items out of the mini bar and use for our own purposes because the bar is sensored and if you pick anything up it will automatically charge your account. To have another fridge brought up was going to be another $30 per night!!! We were a bit annoyed at paying ALOT more for not really more amenities. We rang front desk to ask to see a basic room, to see what the difference in $100 per night is and they said we are all booked out of basic rooms so no, you can't see one and I said ' well we were just charged an extra $100 per night for the upgrade - I'm not going to pay the extra if our basic room was booked out anyway ' He said he would transfer me to the manager but hung up on me instead. We headed down to the front desk and spoke to the girl who had originally served us. I told her what the guy on the phone had said and she told us he was lying just so that we couldn't see the basic because they don't do room shows. But she gave us a key to a basic room and saidf we could quickly have a look. The basic room was the same size, had a tv in the room as well as the bathroom - the only difference was it wasn't as new and we didn't have a view. We asked to go back to the basic room because we couldn't relly see what we were paying an extra $100 per night for. Once we were settled we were able to have a look around and Caesars is MASSIVE. Every time we left our room to go somewhere we got lost. There are so many restaurant, casinos, clubs, shops - you don't have to leave this hotel if you don't want. The hotel itself is beautiful, lots of fountains and statues, the pool areas are really nice. The only thing which we didn't like, but I'm sure that this is everywhere is Vegas, is it was so busy. Like you have busy, and then there's is just so over the top busy it annoyed us a little. We also had a little incidence where we decided to go out somewhere on a Saturday night and we drove there. We got back to the hotel around 10pm (after taking 1 hour to drive 500 metre down the strip). Once we got there valet said they were full. We said well, we're staying here so just park the car. He said you'll have to go to the Forum Shops valet. We went there but they just had signs everywhere saying they were full too. So we had to try to self park, but self parking was full too! I was really really p****ed off and annoyed that they do not have guest assigned parking. What were we meant to do if we couldn't park??? Were we meant to go to another casino, park our car there and then go back to our room at Caesars??? That really put Caesars on my bad side. In the end, after driving around the car park for ages, we were lucky to catch someone leaving and got a spot. So after arriving at the hotel at 10, we got into our room at midnight. NOT HAPPY. This hotel is so big they don't care if one customer isn't happy (unless of course your a high roller).

Enquired about upgrading, but not worth it as we didnt intend to spend much time in room so stayed with our original booking of standard room in Palace Tower. We were amazed! Lovely spacious room with 2 queen beds (oooo so cumfy mattress). Spotless bathroom, wonderful shower with head the size of dinner plate! Free safe, 2 hairdryers, iron and ironing board (???).Can recommend for anyone not wishing to spend precious time in room (who needs plasma TV?). Not far to pool either. We can certainly recommend this hotel. Staff ultra helpful, we had no queue for check in/out. Concierge very willing to make our phone calls and answer queries.WONDERFUL pool... BUT only downer was the fact that the poolside bar closed at 6.30 and one night when we rushed to get back for poolside drink at 6 it had already closed, along with one pool for wedding reception. Long trek from hotel bar with plastic glasses!! But we were thrilled with the location on the strip... one of the best. Didn't have any problem with \"upfront payment from credit card\" which I had read about here. Nothing was taken from my account. Only charged me for a phone call made from room. I would certainly go back. WORD OF WARNING.... one pool was closed the day before we left. We were told it was because they are building another tower (block of rooms) and the pool area is all being re designed. So anyone going from now on may encounter some disruption there. Dont miss the free fountain show. at CP .There are 2, one cost $14m a few years ago and the new one cost $24m. Quite amazing. Get to it by going up by the side of Gucci in the Forum Shops. We got to visit many of the other hotels and the only ones we would stay in (out of those we visited) are this one, Bellagio, Venetian, Rio, Ballys, Paris and Mirage. Had amazing meal in Eiffel Tower Restaurant in Paris Hotel, overlooking Bellagio fountains. (Very romantic for couples). Also don't miss Treasure Iand show and Mirage erupting volvano.

Employee Service: the \"regular\" employees - casino wandering-around basic staff, daily housekeeping folks & waitresses are good. They try hard and take their \"customer excellence\" training seriously. The middle-management level: POOR. Take themselves too seriously yet are not empowered to make the most basic decisions. Example: a Diamond level registration clerk who can't remove an erroneous show ticket charge without making several phone calls and making us wait 20 minutes. Another example: our room (in the Augustus tower) was dirty. The daily housekeeping stuff was fine, but root-level DIRTY. Filthy looking carpet (just needed to be replaced). Worst, weird stains on the drapes. Looked fine when drapes were open but beware when you close them. Looked like someone had projectile vomited all over them (really). The chair at the table next to the drapes had suffered the same fate (gross). The other chair at the table was missing a big button and looked basically dirty. I complained to my host and guest services and they treated me with doubt and nothing was ever corrected. Also, no hair dryer in the bath vanity drawer. No big deal but I called housekeeping to bring one up and was questioned for 5 minutes about how carefully I looked for it and made to check again. I did, no dryer. Finally brought one up after 1/2 hour and another phone call. I don't need to steal a cheap hotel hair dryer if that's the problem. Casino was fine. To me they're all about the same.

The facility was great, but a little more work and service would make it great. LOCATION: While almost every place on the Strip is close, CP is located close to the heart of the action. ***** CHECK IN/CHECK OUT: Considering I arrived around prime time for our convention and the lines to check in were long, the staff moved us along quickly. Rates were accurate, and one of my earlier arriving employees suggested that they take good care of me. I was upgraded to a Jr. Suite in the Palace Tower. The experience checking out was the same, but it would be nice to have an option to skip the front desk to leave. **** ROOMS: The room was well appointed and very comfortable. I had plenty of room, a very large bathroom (2) and nice electronics (flat screen). The lines, carpet and tilework were impressive. My only complaint was a strange oil stain on the bed skirt, which was eventually replaced. **** SERVICE: The operator never let the phone ring more than twice. The staff was all very friendly and seemed to be eager to please. Unfortunately, I had to make each request (changing the bedskirt and ordering room service food) took a subsequent call to get results. My late night food order was supposed to be delivered in 30 minutes. After 1.5 hours, I called again, and it was delivered in 19 minutes. They did comp the meal. ** FACILITIES: The casino, shops, lobby and pool were all very well done. This is a massive property with something for everyone. My feet were worn out before I could cover the whole property. I didn't use the gym, as it was a substantial extra charge. The convention facilities were first rate. Air conditioning was as cold as desired. The new Venus pool is also apparently bikini-top optional. **** RESTAURANTS: Outside of the food court, the restaurants are on the pricey side, but were reasonable for the fare. We ate at 808, the Chinese place next to Rao's and Chinois (W. Puck's). Chinois was my favorite, although all were very good. For the top restaurants, try to make reservations as soon as you can plan your dinners. ***** CASINO: I am not much of a gambler, but the casino has as many options as you would like (other than cheap tables). While there is smoking in the casino, the air filters work well. I like the new receipt system for slots (I left up $120!). **** OTHER: Par for the course on the center of the Strip, not much is cheap or free, including sodas ($3), shipping ($25 to receive 2 small boxes for a convention and $10 to have them hand one box to FedEx), and expensive WiFi. The taxi stand moves quickly and it is pretty cheap to get about town when you aren't up for walking. *** OVERALL: I had a great time, but a little more effort on the service/room keeping side would have been a plus. I still, however, recommend CP. It is on the same level, in my opinion, as Mandalay Bay and the Venetian, where I have also stayed. I give it a very solid recommendation for convention planning. ****", "Date": "September 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cPlastic Covered Elegance\u201d", "Author": "hdblue", "ReviewID": "UR8708921", "Content": "I recently stayed at Caesars Palace for a convention for four days.

The room had a plasma TV and the bathroom was bigger then the room. The AC did not work very well, I could never get the room to cool and I heard many people say the same thing. The shower pressure is so bad you have to jog around to get wet. The tub with jacquizzi is very nice and works well. The room, while it looked recently renovated was cheap, the sheets were cheep, the furniture was cheap even the in room safe is too small to put anything into. There is no coffee maker in the room either. I have definitely stayed at nicer rooms in Las Vegas at Mirage and Bellagio. The price for the rooms is not cheap so you should expect better. Service - Absolutely horrible. You wait in line for EVERYTHING down to coffee in the morning. Everything is under staffed and all the staff act like they have done you a favor for serving you. The prices are ridiculous bordering on absurd down to the $7 for coffee. It takes an hour to check in, no one helps you with your bags and the line for cabs goes on forever, but of course Las Vegas is more like Disney World now then a gambling mecca so it fits with the theme.

I booked a room 5 weeks in advance for Sept 1 - 4 and booked it for $500 on Saturday and $130 for Sunday and Monday for a standard room. Upon check-in we decided to upgrade for an additional $150 a night - not as great as what others got. They said we had a view of the strip but it was more of a partial view because we faced the Bellagio. The room was 570 sq feet w/ a big bathroom. The bathroom was my favorite because it had a small flat screen TV in it. Both TV's only had about 15 channels to choose from which is pretty lame. When we checked in we were told it would be 60-90 minutes until our room was ready. We came back 2 hours later and were told it would be another 2 hours. We said we would skip the upgrade and take the standard room. We got up to our standard room and it was dirty from the previous guests; the maids told us they hadn't even cleaned it yet and said it would be a while. We went back to the front desk and were told that our upgrade was available and that the front desk person who had said it wasn't ready didn't know what they were doing. They gave us a $25 credit for the inconvenience. We spent a while each day at the pool and the service is non-existent. We saw a server 2 times in 3 days. A double rum & coke was 19 bucks and a bud light was 8 bucks. I ordered a 12 ounce pina colada but she brought me a 32 ounce for 19 bucks because it was a better deal. The 2 times we got service within 3 days we tipped hard core hoping they would come back, but right after we tipped them both said their shift was over. Every time we called concierge there was no answer. We left a few messages but no one called us back. This was our first time at Caesar's and I only liked it for the location. We've stayed at MGM Grand several times and never had as many problems. Another thing is when we checked out I saw several $5-$6 charges and asked what they were. They said we had taken Gaterade, juice, and a starbucks drink from our fridge. I told them we never drank them but moved them to put bottled water in the fridge. They said their fridges are censored and charge you even if you pick up something to look at it, but they waived it since we didn't drink them.

There are aspects of this hotel that would cause us to not stay here again. The room was large but the carpeting was extremely badly stained. We felt we had to wera our shoes all the time. The middle drawer would not open. Lots of noise can be heard from the room next door. Not loud music but just people talking can be heard right through the walls. The room attendant never did quite restock our suplies once correctly. It was really hit and miss what would be missing. We had a package shipped to the hotel for our arrival. They charged us $40 handling fee. This was excessive considering the Flamingo only charges $5.00. The pool closes at 7:00 which is way too early when the temperature is 109. The only safe time to swim is the evening. Other hotels keep their pools open much later. Also the access to the pool is through part of the casino and through the Apian way shopping area. Since this hotel attracts masses of tourists who are just looking around everything is very congested. When we arrived the valet could not handle any more cars so we were directed to self park. The elevators down (2 sets of them) were so crowded there was a line up winding into the hallway to get one which took about 10 minutes. The buffet is way over priced with limited selection. The quality was good but uninteresting items. The TI, Paris or Bellagio has much better food. If I had anything good to say it would be that the beds were clean and comfortable. The pool area is very nice but lacks shade during the high sun hours. We have been to Vegas about 15 times and can advise to stay away from the low end places like Circis Circus, Imperial Palace and all the Station casinos.

Booked a Classic room, but paid for an upgrade to Palace Tower on arrival. Did not like the fact that they wanted $50 more per night for the Augustus Tower upgrade than the Palace, despite the fact these two towers are the exact same rate on the Caesars' web site. When I mentioned this, the clerk implied that was not true, but anyone can check their web site to see that it is. The clerk had a very patronizing attitude, while being totally incorrect, and it bothered me that they were either not being honest with me or extremely ignorant regarding what the room rates are on their own website. I was also taken aback that the Augustus Tower had an elevator security desk, but there was absolutely no elevator security at any of the other towers (including the Palace). It was as if the safety of the Augustus tower guests was somehow more important than that of the other guests. Had I been staying alone, I would not have felt all that safe going to my room late at night, as I did see some odd characters wandering the halls and elevators. The first room we were given after we upgraded was overlooking a construction area and reeked of smoke (called a non-designated room). Went back to desk and it was exchanged for a non-smoking room overlooking pool, but they were not very gracious about it, despite the fact that when we booked the room months ago, non-smoking was requested. The room had a nice and large bathroom, but the actual room was nothing special. The inner and outer drapes were both broken, with the plastic rods lying on the floor. We just pulled them back and improvised to keep them open. The desk had a large black stain (whether from age or something else, I had no idea), and the desk drawer knob was missing. The tv was a modern flat panel, but the remote was a piece of junk that barely worked. The carpet was unattractive and rough, and the closet doors were ancient with a bad paint job. The service was what you would expect at any of the nicer hotels on the strip--polite and helpful. The lobby and other areas were beautiful and clean, and it was very nice having so much under one roof in the 107 degree heat. The pools (my main reason for choosing Caesars) were quite beautiful, but the lounge chairs were awful. The cushions were very old and frankly, filthy, but you could cover them with towels. The metal on the chairs became so hot you could not touch it. They really need modern lounge chairs made from more appropriate materials. I also had the feeling they were trying to wring every extra dime out of the guests that they possibly could. A well drink at the pool was $12 (plus tip), which is a little extreme even for Vegas. Overall the property is nice and the location is excellent. But my impression is that it is a 4-star resort that thinks it's a 5.

I booked the room through Expedia, as they had a fabulous exclusive offer: book a \"classic\" room and receive an automatic upgrade and a $25 spa credit.

Our trip was only a short one, but we decided to upgrade to the deluxe room for the extra comfort.

We were quickly accommodated, AND upgraded to a Luxury room, with an amazing view of the Bellagio fountain and the mini Eiffel tower. The rule in Vegas is to ask for anything and everything, you'll find you get more than you thought possible! The room itself was beautiful and CLEAN, with a whole new set of toiletries and fresh towels each day. Due to a room mix-up with our friends, we were given free passes to the gym/spa, which we took advantage of one morning. Although the gym looked inviting, we were on vacation, so no workout for us! The spa, however, was spectacular, be sure to take advantage of the Artic ice room, where you can sit on a heated bench in the \u2018snow\u2019. The pool deserves its own review in Travelocity, it\u2019s absolutely stunning. The fountains and surroundings are breathtaking, and there were always lounge chairs to be found. When at Caesars, be sure to stroll along to the forum shops, it is by far the best shopping in Vegas.

When we came back to Caesars on Saturday night, the place was a zoo. - We LOVED Mesa Grill. The food was exceptional though the drinks were unnecessarily expensive. The restaurant decor is a little strange, though, because you look out through windows into the main sports gambling area, and while we were there that night, they were showing some lingerie shows on the giant TVs, which didn't particularly whet my appetite. - We ate at the buffet for lunch, which was a good value, because we had $10 off coupons, but I would not waste my money there for dinner. All in all, if you can get a good deal, it is well worth staying there and we loved our experience.

The hotel is beautiful, clean and has very friendly staff. Arrived by chartered van to a side entrance for vans. No one asked to take our bags for us. I felt like a servant coming in the back door. The front entrance has excellent service though but I didn't get to experience that. Take an SUV taxi or Limo (both are $6 to $12 per person) from the airport to get front door service. Expect a long wait at check in. Even though the check in area is huge, they never had more that 4 people taking care of everyone. The desk area looked big enough for 12 people to be working it. (Possible money problems for the hotel and not wanting to overstaff for the sake of their guests????) The lady was extremely nice at check in though. Our room, not an expensive one, was clean and comfortable. The beds were comfortable as well. Don't drink the bottled water in the room. It is $4 a bottle. This room was very similar to something like you would get at a Hampton's Inn. The main casino is beautiful and clean but a little smoky which I expected. Lots of slots and table games to choose from. There are plenty of place to eat and drink but they are VERY EXPENSIVE. The buffet breakfast on Saturday morning was $23.50 per person. WAAAAAYYYYYY overpriced but the food was good. The pool area is beautiful. There is a topless pool area that is hidden at ground level but is definatley viewable from some of the rooms on the upper levels. Lets talks clubs, bars and dance clubs. All drinks at bars are expensive beyond reason (most hotels do this). Not all dance clubs (PURE being one) are accessable by hotel guests. You can and will be turned away if you are not, young, hot and single. I think this is a bad idea to turn way guests at a dance club that is inside the hotel you paid money to stay in. (Other Hotels do the same thing.....like the MGM grand). There are no excuses for this. If you are wearing a wedding ring, don't expect to be able to get in to some of these dance clubs. Lots of rich and super rich people stay here from what I could tell and because I did talk to alot of them. Don't expect alot of courtesy from guests. It seems that being rude on vacation is acceptable here. The hotel is situated perfectly on the strip and you can reach 1 of 7 different hotels in minutes. My advise if you stay here, go to the CVS or Walgreens drug stores up near NEW YORK NEW YORK to buy water, beer, snacks.....and anything else you need and bring it here to your room. They have almost any bottled beer, so it is very easy to bring a couple from your room to the casino floor. If you want to gamble, the slots at Caesars are not very generous. Play the table games or go across the street to Bills Gambling Hall and Saloon (was Barbary Coast). They have .99 cent Margaritas and $1.50 Beck drafts. The gambling and atmosphere are more fun at Bill's as well. All in all, I think it is a good choice to stay at Caesar's because it is clean and the room pricing isn't that bad for a standard room. You will be clean, comfortable and safe. I recommend spending your money at another casino for food, drinks and gambling. It takes alot of money for the hotel to make a profit is the bottom line. Make no mistake, this hotel caters to the rich, weathly and super rich. There is nothing wrong with that unless you are not one of these.

While unpacking I stepped in something wet on the floor - which turned out to be spilt beer. When I went to call the front desk to alert them - all the buttons were missing from the phone. We were moved to another room in another tower (NOT UPGRADED) and couldn't believe our eyes. The bathroom had a used bar of soap at the sink and a dirty towel on the counter.

They told us to call housekeeping - housekeeping stated the room was showing \"dirty\" in their system.....but they sent no one to come and clean it until 9:00 p.m. at night. They did not move us nor did the front desk check back with us. All I can say is this is not what we expected from Caesar's. The casino was extremely smoky and dark. Slots were not paying anything to anyone. And table games were $25 minimums. Servers were no where to be found either. Cafe Lago - $23.50 for less than mediocre food and the service was ridiculous. I don't know if they were short staffed but we waited forever to get a server to our table. The best part of the week was the pool. The pool hosts were spectacular and the drink servers were constantly stopping to ask if you'd like something to drink. One day they did run out of pool towels by noon. Glad I already had mine.

We checked in after 11pm and got a room in the Augustus Tower. I'm not sure if it was an on-spot upgrade, or if was part of the deal I got for the room. I was not comped a room, or set up as a high-roller, but got a work-related discount. I tipped the girl $20 anyways just because I was already prepared to. We were on the 36th floor, so our room overlooked the Bellagio and the fountains. The first day we kept the drapes open to remind ourselves of the novelty of our Vegas trip and the killer view we had of the Strip. But, we quickly learned our lesson. It's August in the desert, and though the windows are tinted, they give off heat like a baking dish out of the oven. The drapes stayed closed the rest of the trip, except a little at night, and we made the mental note of not caring what view we had next time we book a room in Vegas. Huge bathroom in the Augustus Tower, with separate jetted tub and shower, plus a separate room for the toilet and double sinks. Outstanding set-up - just like home, plus a mini flat-screen TV. The highlight of our Caesars experience was the pools. We were there every day for at least 3 hours. It was no trouble getting a good spot by the water, other guests at the hotel were friendly and we watched each other's stuff if someone went to the bathroom or snack shop, or for a swim out of eye-contact from their belongings. Prompt service sold beer by the bucket and mixed drinks from a full-service bar. We were all amused by the Venus Pool scene. We never actually went in the European-sunbathing \"club\" pool, but ads would suggest that it is some in-scene with half-naked celebrities and models. My wife and other neighboring women at the pool watched the Venus entrance and saw college-aged guys filing in, one after another, with an occasional 30-ish couple. Not to take pot-shots at Caesars and the image they want that pool to have, but what we saw from the outside on a Friday, Saturday and Sunday afternoon was a Spring Break sausage party that might make the most robust exhibitionist a little squeamish at dropping her top. Speaking of celebrities and in-scenes, Pure has become the new place to be in the Vegas scene. It's quite an interesting scene around midnight when the line to get in wraps around the sports book and Pussycat Dolls area. We ate at the 808 (Asian-Pacific seafood) and the brunch buffet at Cafe Lago. The brunch was $23.50 a person, which you eventually learn is pretty much the going rate in the heart of the strip. Crab legs and salmon were among the marquee items offered along with eggs, omelettes, pancakes, waffles, etc. Our dinner at 808 was absolutely outstanding. The Cypress Street area was a very under-rated experience of Caesars. It's their \"mall food-court\" area in the casino and we ate there more than we would have anticipated beforehand. Plus, the Java Coast coffee shop was open and serving great coffee on both mornings when I was up and about at 5:30am. I worried when only one restaurant was deemed with 24-hour service since I'm an early-riser who likes coffee. We saw Jerry Seinfeld perform live at The Coliseum, which was an excellent venue - and of course, the show was very memorable. The casino layout was fantastic, with a monsterous sports book area. Caesars now has a little novelty area where the Pussycat Dolls deal blackjack and dance in little cages. It creates quite a scene in there. Very Vegas. We thought the service in the casino area wavered between adequate and outstanding. Just when you realize you hadn't seen a cocktail waitress in more than 10 minutes, three come within 5 minutes. (At Bellagio, there to watch \"O\", we got there early to gamble and have some cocktails. Not one waitress was seen in 20 minutes in the slot area. At the sports book, I sat at the bar and played video poker and ordered a beer. The bartender then handed me a tab - saying I needed to put at least $20 into the machine and bet at least $1 per hand to get a free drink. I laughed and asked about the guys riding a $2 Hollywood Park horserace wager for a half-hour and three stiff drinks. He shot me a dirty look and told me the penny slots were wide open. So by those snobbish standards, Caesars was even more warm and welcoming.) There are cheaper hotel rooms with more modest accommodations, and more tables with minimum bets lower than $25. But even after having visited The Mirage, Bellagio, Venetian, New York, Paris ... I can't see what anyone else can offer that tops what Caesars has. If any of those come close, Caesars runs away from the pack with that intangible feel of old-school Vegas, but with all the modern toys and perks of a 5-star resort.", "Date": "August 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cCaesars Gives High Roller Treatment to a Low Roller!\u201d", "Author": "LtColBuckRobley", "ReviewID": "UR8347932", "Content": "We had 3 nights comped at Caesars in a Standard Room beginning on 7/29.

She gave us a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite in the Augustus Tower with a view of the Bellagio fountains on floor 39. When we tried to tip her a twenty she just waved us off. Needless to say the room and service were incredible! The room itself had plasma televisions in both the bathroom and living room area, plus a couch and sitting area. The bathroom had not only a shower, but jacuzzi tub. Two sinks in the bathroom are great when you're trying to get ready at the same time. It was immaculately clean. Plenty of towels and bathrobes hanging in the closet for our use. My wife loved the turn down service with the chocolates on the bed at night. In short, it made you feel like a high roller and we really aren't huge gamblers. We only ate at one of their restaurants, a food court near the sports book. It was excellent and reasonably priced. Their other restaurants were a little more expensive than we were willing to go. The pool area was incredibly beautiful and not crowded at all. My wife spent two afternoons there and loved it. The casino is huge, but navigable. I placed some bets on baseball in the sportsbook and was given some complimentary drink tickets. Didn't win anything in the casino, but I didn't lose much either. Table minimums start at 25 dollars and head skyward from there. So I stuck mostly to video poker and sports betting. When I asked a gentleman for directions to the promotions desk he didn't tell me or show me where to go. He walked me there. All in all, I couldn't have asked for a more pleasant stay.

I booked my stay directly on Ceasars' web page. I avoided the older towers, as reviews indicated the rooms in the older towers have problems. Upon checking in, I was given a free upgrade to a junior executive suite in the Palace tower. The room was excellent; way above 5 Stars !! A very comfortable king bed, in a large suite. The bathroom was a suite in itself; 2 separate toilet/sink areas linked by a double (i.e. two head & control) shower, with a double wide jacuzzi tub. The room was clean and well furnished. Note: My stay was mid-week during the so-called low season. So, while the upgrade was very nice, it was not too surprising. I would not expect an upgrade over a weekend or during the busier seasons. I used the gym and spa, both were very, very nice. The coed gym has a large collection of mid-grade aerobic equipment, an excellent circuit of high quality weight machines, and some free weights. I got a massage ($140 for 50 mins), which was nice and included use of the spa area. The segregated spa area included several steam rooms, many hot tubs, and a tea area with TV, juices, and tea. The staff was very attentive and professional. It was a great place to relax. The much hyped arctic room, however, was a chilly room with soap bubbles used to simulate snow. Kinda a joke. But that's the only thing anywhere close to being negative about the spa. The outdoor pool areas were very nice and kept orderly by the staff. As one must be over 21 to go into the Venus pool area (as topless sunbathing is allowed), it was a nice place to go and be assured there would be no kids around. In contrast to the quality of everything else, the buffet was a disappointment as it was only \"okay.\" Nothing really bad, just not the high quality of everything else. The desk staff was very nice and helpful during both check in and check out. For check-out (normally 11 AM), I requested a late checkout (1 hour late at 12 noon), which they quickly approved.

I came along to hang out with my buddy as the college kids kept their own late hours of 6 & 7 AM returns to go to sleep. We had nice, clean, serviceable rooms in the Roman Tower which worked out great. We rented a cabana for two days which made all the difference during the day for everyone, since it was 109 degrees outside. The gambling was fun, but the 21 year olds ended up gambling quite a bit somewhere else as the minimums were pretty much $ 25.00 during the weekend. The big problem we had and which really has soured me on this hotel is that while eating dinner at the very ordinary, but dressed up Nero's a waiter from another table dropped steak sauce all over my back. Now instead of stopping and apologizing right away, one of the other members of our party who witnessed the action, heard him say, Oh, $%^& and proceed to head into the kitchen quickly. We called for the manager and he then called security as that is how they handle these procedures. Then I had to fill in an incident report, which was submitted and I was told they would gt back to me. The steak sauce ruinde my shirt and pants, I had to change into my last days clothes a day early to continue our evening and then when I asked about it at check out they told me that the incident report would be in the incedent reports office and they would contact me. The front desk apologized for the incident. Today I called the hotel and they said it will take a week for someone to get back to me as they are backed up with investigations. They did not ask for my incident, but said all incidents take this long. I am extremely dissastisifed with how they are handling this and their indifference to the whole thing. My cleaner said the stains will not come out, so I am out some pretty expensive clothing and lots of time trying to resolve this matter.

Sounds obvious but you're better getting drinks yourself from the snack bar 'snackus maximus' rather than from the pool servers. We said 'yes' to an offer of water and were charged $5 for a bottle of designer water from a server - you can buy bottles for less at the snack bar. We were also charged $20 for 2 margaritas - but the price was the same for virgin versions! Be careful with the mini-bar and souvenirs in the rooms - they are on sensors so when I lifted something up it was instantly charged to our bill! A call to room service and housekeeping corrected this. The Palms restaurant in the Forum shops was excellent - great steaks and we got a free slab of gorgeous cheesecake!

Spent an afternoon at the huge, beautiful pool and felt like I was truly at a luxury resort. The thing I liked best about Caesar's was the sense of tranquility. Even though it was a busy time, with lots of people all around, I never felt overwhelmed and annoyed by the crowd as I have at other, lower tier hotels during previous Las Vegas stays. The staff were all very helpful and very polite and treated me like I was an important guest, even though I am very much middle class and wasn't throwing money around. The thing I liked least about Caesar's was the cost of food. Yes, I understand that it is a higher class of place, but $25 for the dinner buffet ($15 breakfast and $17.50 lunch) was absurd, even though it was very, very good. Prices were unrealistically high at the other restraints as well, forcing me to look elsewhere for a reasonable meal. That being said, Would would I return to Caesar's Palace for another stay? Absolutely! My time there was fun, relaxing, and entirely worth every penny (especially since I wrangled a greatd eal at their website).", "Date": "June 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cBest spot on strip\u201d", "Author": "brooke16", "ReviewID": "UR7955837", "Content": "We stayed at Caesars last august and I did really enjoy it.

We had a room in the old tower, i cant remember the name, but the room was spacious and clean. It was a little outdated but the bathroom was modern and lovely. I had a friend staying in the augustus tower who had a beautiful renovated room but when in las vegas you do not spend too much time in the room so it was a little unnessecary for me. The only thing that was odd about our room was that you used the key intially to obtained access to a hallway and then at the end of the hall were two doors. One led to our room and the other was just a door that didnt need a key card it was a deadbolt that we could open. I tried it to see where it lead and it brought me into another room witha a piano and a man was in there. It was rather embarrasing. Besides this Caesars is a great place to stay while in las vegas.

We've been married for 12yrs but this was a little more \"togetherness\" than we wanted! The housekeeping staff were so friendly and sweet, but the cleaning was a bit lax. There were fuzzy dust bunnies on the ceiling above the bathroom lights, and peanuts on the floor in the corners of the room (that weren't ours!). The linens were clean and nice quality, and the bed comfortable. The door to the adjoining room must be made out of cardboard. We could hear every conversation the neighbours had, and when they came back to the room at 4am (2 nights in a row) drunk and partying, woke us up. The final straw was when their pot-smoke came wafting under the door into our room. We decided to spend a day at the Venus Pool and splurged on \"day beds\" which were $150/day. I didn't realize that the pool was run by the nightclub or I might have not bothered. It was full of so-called \"beautiful people\" (ie/surgically or steroid enhanced) trying to hook up. Our friends waited over an hour for the guy to bring an umbrella (we tried to move one ourselves and were told not to). The music was good but very loud, the drinks were ridiculously expensive, and the water was from Norway at $6 for a small bottle (no, seriously). They messed up my lunch order and made no effort to compensate for their error. By the end of the day the water was a disgusting cess-pool of tanning oil and who knows what else, we didn't even want to go in. The final insult was when we received the bill at the end of the day ...and they'd tacked on about $75 in \"gratuities\"...we'd already tipped everyone in cash!!

Caesar's is very spread out and the staff's directions are extremely vague - which is actually much like Italy (hahaha..smirking to myself right now). Our room was in Palace Tower. The room was decent size, but I think probably typical room size for Vegas. The bathroom was good size. One light over the sinks was broken. The bars in front of the sinks were broken. Jacuzzi tub did not work. No biggie, but I figured housekeeping would catch these. The TV stations were terrible. I realize you aren't there to watch TV, but we were hoping to catch the Sopranos finale. The pool area was OK. Pool side service was terrible. Very hard to get a drink. We gave our order to a server and after an hour later we got our own drinks at the bar. The 2nd day we rented a bed by the pool. It was pricey but it was nice luxury. The cabanas were too expensive for just 2 but if we were traveling with another couple or two, it would have definitely been worth it. Courtney, our server the day we rented the bed was great! She was so attentive and on top of things, unlike the regular bar servers. I thought the pools were small and they seemed dirty. The tiles were slimey.

They were aware I was attending a conference and pointed me in the direction where the conference was being held and other attractions at the hotel. Room: The room was gorgeous...the best I've ever stayed! Decor was modern and clean. The view of Vegas was amazing. The marble bathroom was huge with double sinks, shower and spa tub. Vanity was just outside the bathroom. There was a plasma tv and well stocked mini-bar. (warning: mini-bar had sensors and sometimes charges just for picking up things as I found out during check-out...I was not charged in the end and staff were very nice about it) The bed and linen were the luxurious and comfortable. The only fault in the room that I could find was that the closet door was coming off the hinge slightly and jammed once in awhile, but that's being really picky.

Caesars is well known for the Forum shops, Celine Dion, Pure and PCD Lounge. Restaurants: I went to Spago and Mesa Grill. It can be a little noisy at Spago, since it is in the Forum shop area.

Stayed in the Palace Tower which was so handy for the pool, room was good really spacious and clean (again the UK really falls down badly on room sizes and clean bathrooms!). Found the casino really manic especially after Wynn but as it is centre strip what do you expect. Didn't eat at Caesars except at \"Snaxus Maximus\" by the pool this was very reasonably priced. Drinks service at the pool was excellent given that it was so busy. Oh, we also ate at the Augustas cafe which was also pretty good Had a few bottles of Champagne at the Seahorse Bar which wasn't too packed. We just love Vegas there is nowhere else where you can sit in the sun all day if you want to , shop all day if you want, to gamble all day if you want to, eat anytime of the day or night, see the best shows ( we saw Stomp Out Loud, Love and O) all fantastic. Free live music in the bars - brilliant - especially at Paris The weather was great very hot, have been to Vegas 4 times before and this the hottest time yet, I love that it isn't humid at all and NO FLYS!!! We did hire a car for the duration of our holiday which we always do, even the new car hire centre was great - no queues We also went to Laughlin for a few days for a bit of a break Americans - you don't know how lucky you are having all this without needing a passport.

I spent $313 for a Palace Tower room with a whirlpool spa and king size bed at Caesar's. Should have taken the Wynn Executive Suite at $350, but I'm a schmuck, or at least shouldn't have let the Caesar's reservation agent talk me into the palace tower instead of the regular room at $180. Specifically requested non-smoking, didn't get it. Oh well. I was pissed and had stopped caring. The hotel is faux beautiful. Not beautiful like Bellagio or the gorgeous Wynn, faux beautiful. The pools were nice, but as a 6'2\" dude, I longed for something deeper than 3'6\". We checked in around noon and were given our room immediately, always nice. Big property, but after dealing with MGM Grand, this place was a mini-mart. The room was very pretty, but very small for the price. Was expecting something much bigger, considering I got a cushy suite at MGM for less than half what I paid here. Here's my advice: If you're gonna spend $200+ on a hotel room on the Strip, get a super nice room at MGM or Mirage or ti, or go to Bellagio or the Wynn instead. This place just isn't worth it.

I had not been to Las Vegas before this and wasn't exactly sure what to expect. Here are my observations. 1) Vegas is not a family place. It is what it is. You go for the gambling, the shows, the partying. It is never someplace I would take my kids. I was surprised at the number of kids I saw. 2) Vegas is not cheap. Somehow my impression of Vegas before I went was that it wouldn't be overpriced. Food would be reasonable and rooms reasonable. Food is expensive. Breakfast onsite consists of a $10 muffin if you want quick and cheap. There are a couple of Denny/IHop type joints within walking distance but their prices are a little higher then the usual fare at home. All of which is fine, but I expected different. The rooms during the week are a little less about $180 a night and reasonable for the 'class' of room we stayed in. The same room went to $400 a night for the weekend. Definitely not cheap. 3) Caesars has a nice setup at their hotel. There is a shopping forum with any and every imaginable retailer located there. All pricey and most of us did alot of window shopping only. Their pools are very nice. One is 'european style' so be aware of that. They have cabanas (some air conditioned) and the usual bar/food available. Vegas is HOT. Most bathers were in the pool at 9 am and out by noon. Back in around 4 pm. Between 11 am and 4 pm most people were in an air conditioned building somewhere. Caesars also have very good bell hop and front desk setup. Well marked, and broken into various services: 1) key/mail, 2) check in, 3) check out, etc. Easy traffic flow. 4) There is a 'monorail' that runs along about 8 stops/casinos. It does not go to the airport, so you have to use a cab (about $13 one way), a shuttle (about $7 one way) or a car service (about $50 one way) for airport transfers. However, the monorail was a great option for us to get from Caesars (the stop is across from Caesars at the Flamingo) to the MGM Grand for the fight we saw. It was $5 a person and only a 5 minute ride. One more comment on the airport - it is only about a 10 minute cab ride away which is very convenient. We ate at two onsite restaurants at Caesars: Spago and Mesa Grill. Both pricey. Spago was a waste of money. We had dinner there and it was very very noisy. You could not carry a conversation. The service was excellent but the food was lack luster. I had a salad and a salmon dish. The salmon was surprisingly salty. Anyway, we walked away feeling like we'd had a \"olive garden chain\" quality meal, at very high end prices. It wasn't that the food was awful, but with the atmosphere being bad and the food \"ify\" we weren't pleased. On the other hand, Mesa Grill was awesome. We had lunch there. Atmosphere is much better. We had a pleasant time talking. The service was excellent and the food awesome. By far the best meal I have had in a long time. I had a corn/tomatoe soup and a spicy scrambled egg dish. Unusual and very worth it. We felt it was worth every penny we paid. Caesars has all the gambling you'd expect. Every conceivable game. The hotel and all its various areas were very clean and nice. It is glitzy but you expect that in Vegas. The bathrooms were clean too. I have no inclination to visit Vegas again but that is mostly because gambling is not my thing. It is VERY HOT there too.

I have recently returned from a fabulous week staying there and can't find anything what-so-ever to complain about. If you have stayed here and have been disappointed with the standard of the hotel, then please don't ever come to the U.K. as you will be horrified with the standard of the hotels here compared to the Caesars (in a nutshell, there is nothing here that can compare!)! My friend and I arrived at around 1:30pm, tired after having had an 11 hour flight. The line for check in seemed long but only took around 15 minutes. We had booked a basic room and were offered a room upgrade for $120 per night, we declined and the price was reduced to $80 per night, which we gladly accepted. Our upgrade was for a room in the Augustus Tower with what I can only describe as the best views on the strip! It overlooked the southern end of the strip and the Bellagio fountains, wowww! (Worth the $80 per night for the view alone). Our spotlessly clean, immaculately presented room had 2 super comfy queen size beds, large jacuzzi tub, settee, small dining area, 2 plasma TV's (one in the bathroom) and Caesars Palace robes)! There is no refrigerator in the room but I read that one would be made available if required (although I didn't do this). Bar prices in the room are $4 each for soft drinks and water and $6 for a beer, Room service is very swift and I thought reasonably priced compared with British hotels of a much less standard. One night we were sent the wrong order, we were promptly sent our correct one free of charge and even had a telephone call from the restaurant manager to apologise for the inconvenience, now that's what I call service! The hotel itself is huge (about the size as the village I live in)! The pool complex is magnificent, if you wish to go in the adult area remember to take ID, my friend was declined admittance as she didn't have hers with her, shes 41! The overall feeling of the hotel is one of grandeur, right from the lobby all the way through to the Forum shops (upgrade your credit card if shopping here)! We mainly ate in the Cafe Lago which is situated close to the pool entrance. The buffet meals there are excellent, $15 for breakfast which consists of just about every breakfast food you can imagine, the freshy squeezed orange juice is to die for! We had the breakfast buffet ($15.50) one morning at the Bellagio and neither my friend or I thought the food or the service could compare with Caesars. The hotel is situated in prime position mid strip (next door to the Bellagio and across the road from Paris). The strip itself is huge, make sure to take comfortable shoes and plenty of elastoplast! My friend and I weren't daunted by this, no cabs/buses/monorail for us, we walked everywhere, mainly to enjoy the sunshine as it was far too hot to lie in (late 90's). We tried to see as many attractions as we possibly could in the week we were there, I particulary enjoyed stroking the stingrays and small sharks in the Shark Reef at Mandalay Bar ($14.95 entrance fee). Look out for the ticket booths located up and down the strip, they have fantastic deals on most shows and attractions, ie: we paid $24 each for entrance into the Titanic exhibition, we could have bought them at these booths for $11 each! Also, look though the brochures that are in left in your room, they have great 2 for 1 show offers and a few $'s off some of the attractions. For me, my favourite attractions were the one's that were free! I just loved the Bellagio fountains and could have stayed there all day watching them. The light shows at Fremont Street are another must see, they are amazing! A cab will cost around $15 each way but it is well worth it, the drinks here are less than half of the price of what you will pay on the strip. The airport is situated only a few miles away from the strip so if travelling from the UK don't be fooled into booking an expensive package holiday. You will get (like I did) a much better deal booking a flight and the hotel separately. I searched the net for months trying to find the best deals and I found that the best rate was directly with the hotel.

Pool: area is impressive and a place to be seen, but not high on adventure. Crowded during the day, and not much shade. The taxi line is LONG all day long except between 3am and 9am. Seems almost everyone who stays here flies into town and doesn't bother with a rental car. The only relief you'll get for the taxi line is to be a Harrah's Diamond-level Total Rewards member. The valet line isn't as long. The weekend casino crowd and nightlife at Caesar's is HOT and the people are more beautiful, and more affluently youthful than at any other casino resort on the strip. The new Pussycat Dolls dealer area is smart and sexy! And Pure lounge is still one of the hottest clubs on the strip, top 2 or 3 anyway. If you're planning to stay here...make sure you bring the best that your wardrobe has to offer -- or your high-limit credit card...The Forum Shops have all the designer stores you need. :) Everyone in Vegas dresses to the 9s, especially at night. There's no such thing as overdoing it in Vegas. The weekend rate is pricey...and it's not much cheaper to stay here during sunday-thursday, but you get what you pay for.

However, since we were there mainly for the pools, which we expressly told the desk clerk at check-in, we took the $80/night upgrade offered for the Palace Tower as that's just across from the pool entry. Of course, only after we were done with the process were we told that all but one of the pools would be closed the next day for a special event!!! GRR. One pool was open but it got crowded pretty fast and lots of people were out of luck. THE POOLS The pool complex itself is *gorgeous*, really amazing. TIP: People go in at 8am when the pool opens, pick out choice deck chairs and reserve them with towels, and then take off for hours, leaving many people looking around wondering why so many chairs are unused but off-limits. I think that's rude but that's what happens. Maybe not such a big deal when all the pools are open but it's annoying when not. FYI, occasionally someone in gold will walk by and ask if you want a drink from the bar, but the pool snack bar ('Snackus Maximus' ) doesn't open until 11am. We didn't get to the Venus Pool during our stay but noticed the lineup for it (this pool opened at 9:30am -- the rest of them open at 8am) consisted mainly of guys. Who knew so many of them like to pay to see each other topless! :) THE ROOM From the 26th floor of the Palace Tower we had a view of the Mirage and Treasure Island and could see a bit of the 'fire show' at the Mirage at night. I think the other side would've looked over the pools though, which might be nicer. The room itself was better than average. Large space, crisp white linens on the bed, flat screen tv. I thought housekeeping was great -- better than the Luxor, that's for sure. The room got made up nicely each day between noon and 5pm and they offered turn-down service, towels, and little chocolate coins each night. THE GAMBLING AND DRINKING The slots are Caesars aren't as generous as they are at Bally's across the street -- and the waitresses there are way faster with the drinks! -- so we headed over there a lot. Bally's is in the same casino 'family' so the rewards card is the same, which is nice. THE FOOD 1. Augustus Cafe -- Service was pleasant but the food was mediocre and overpriced. Coffee is $4 and fries (also $4) are not included with a sandwich ($12-$15). 2. Rao **for lunch** (you need to book well in advance for the evening) -- It was BEAUTIFUL: food was great, setting was amazing, and service was outstanding. 3. Spago (Forum Shops) -- Busy and loud, but both the service and the food were great. TIP: You get a discount here if you have your casino rewards card! 4. Cypress Cafe -- Food court option. I liked it fine. THE ENTERTAINMENT Due to a carding issue with a bartender on the first night (TIP: have your i.d. on you even if you're middle age!), we got VIP passes to Pure, the high-end nightclub at Caesars. We were a little dubious about how well these would work since you see people handing out 'VIP' passes for various things all over town, so I called down to ask that my name definitely be at the door so we wouldn't waste a bunch of time in line for nothing. Whether it was the particular passes we got or the call, I don't know, but we were treated like GOLD. There was a huge lineup of beautiful people but we got to hang out at the front and the security guys were so nice! And then we got comp'd admission to the Club (regular) and the Pussycat Dolls Lounge -- which was really amazing, the highlight of the trip. More on that in a second. TIP: Rest before you go. You're going to wait in line at least 15 minutes before you get in, and if you want to sit when you get in the club, you have to buy a lot of champagne and/or buy a seating area in advance. The couches and tables are all roped off, which makes negotiating the interior a little hard, but the club itself is beautiful and then you go upstairs and there's this outstanding outdoor patio...really nice experience. PLUS, the dj was awesome, which made for a super fun dance floor! TIP: See the Pussycat Dolls in the lounge! These are not the PCDs from the videos -- it's the local franchise -- but these girls are also really talented. The singing was great, the dancing was athletic and creative, and the show beats any of the topless shows in town (apparently) for sex appeal. Funny thing was, most of the audience when I was there was female...clearly this is the population missing from the Venus Pool! :) Aside from that, we didn't have plans for the second night so thought -- naively -- we'd 'drop in' to see Celine. Ah, no. The show ticket person just laughed at me when I asked for tickets that night. Sold out in advance and a lineup of 'standbys' besides. But what the heck, you're at Caesars!--the centre of the glittery-concrete universe--so go for a walk and check out what's down the street.... CHECK OUT Tried (begged?) for a late check-out and was met with more resistance than the French showed. Made for a long hot day waiting for the plane, wishing I was beside the pool again....

The appointments were very nice. The down side that we found were that there were two bulbs out in the bathroom. We asked them to replace them, but they never did. The housekeeping wasn't quite up to par (dust on some things), shampoos and lotions were not consistent from one day to the next. They left a cleaning bottle on the counter of the bathroom one day. They did bring hypoallergenic pillows when requested. The air conditioning was not quite as cool as the digital thermostat said it was, but it was liveable. The lobby, ground, and Forum Shops were all very nice. The Venus Pool with \"European\" bathing was closed. The other pools in the Garden of the Gods looked very nice and comfortable.

Have not seen that in any other Vegas spa. The service was incredible. The Front Desk staff was very helpful in assigning me a room based on my stated preference. There were four of us in the room and Housekeeping always kept us supplied with extra towels. With all the wonderful restaurants in the hotel plus those in the Forum Shops we always had numerous choices for dinner. Try Sushi Roku in the Forum for a unique meal. The pool area was huge, with four different pools to choose from. We tried the new Venus Pool area run by the Pure Nightclub, and this is our only compliant. We were not allowed to bring in any food/drink from outside. They actually made us step outside their area to eat our take-out breakfast we had bought inside the hotel. And the pool area doesn't even sell breakfast items. Their drinks & food are highly overpriced (even by Vegas standards). When we moved the chairs to get into the sun, they made us move them back into partial shade. In order to sit up along the pool edge, they wanted us to pay an extra charge. So I'll log these compliants here enough though Caesars has no say in how this pool area is managed.

Arrival: Wednesday, April 25 Early morning flight into Vegas on Southwest Airlines. Very uneventful, pleasant flight with beautiful weather. Getting our bags was easy, although I was amazed at the size of the baggage claim area. Cab was easy to find and almost no wait. Ten minute ride to Caesars (no tunnel, didn\u2019t ask, just wanted to see which way the cabby would take us) in an SUV cab cost about $12 for us with two other people from our group. Caesar's Palace: Beautiful place. Loved all of the marble. Sure there is a slight cheesiness factor with the Roman theme, but I really liked this place, way more than I expected to. Of course, the sweet suite upgrade they gave us probably biased me a bit, more on that later. Customer service was stellar and very friendly throughout, from the bellhops to the front desk to random employees I stopped and asked for directions. Since it was only about 9:30 in the morning, and we were told we couldn't check in until at least 1:00, we decided to do a little exploring with our group of 5. Wandered through the casino, which was pleasantly light on smoke. It was there, but wasn't overwhelming and never bothered me. Spotted the sports book and placed a $20 bet on Liverpool in their Champion's League semifinal matchup against Chelsea, and then headed towards the Forum Shops. Forum Shops: A very nice upscale shopping mall. Again, lots of marble, some cheesiness with the sculptures and fountains, but really quite nice. We avoided the high end stuff, but my wife needed a dress so she and her friend hit Ann Taylor and Banana Republic where they found some decent sale prices. We had planned to hit Sushi Roku for lunch and were all hungry, so we headed to the new end of the shops to check it out. We were a couple of hours early for lunch, so we decided to take a load off and start to some serious drinking. Found a cool little spot to drink called . . . Casa Fuente: a cigar bar on the lower level of the newer end of the Forum Shops. They made some great mojitos and some drinks we\u2019d never had before, and we tried them all. Drinks were in the $10-15 range, beers $6-7. Got quite liquored up before noon, which was fun. While we were there we saw Steve Garvey signing autographs at the nearby sports memorabilia store and got an autograph. He was very nice and willing to chat about some rather odd things with a bunch of drunk lawyers from Texas, so I became an even bigger fan than I was from my days as a teenager growing up in Southern California and watching him play with the Dodgers and Padres. It was noon, and we were drunk and hungry, so time for some sushi upstairs at . . . Sushi Roku: nice sushi with an even better Strip view. I\u2019m not a sushi aficionado, and this was only my second time to try it, so I can\u2019t help with much of a food review. The sushi/sashimi was very good and fresh to this amateur and the tempura was nice as well. We ordered a sushi combo plate, a sashimi combo, and two tempura combo plates for the 5 of us, along with some warm saki and huge Japanese beers. This was enough for a decent meal, not overly filling, but great for a lunch. I think we spent $175 including tax and tip, which didn\u2019t seem bad for 5 hungry drunks. The restaurant is a modern space with dark furnishings and one huge wall of windows with a spectacular view down the Strip. I can only imagine how cool the view would be at dinner time. I would definitely return, although I don\u2019t think my wife will as she is just not a fan of raw seafood. Even more drunk, but nicely filled, we head to check-in to get our rooms. Our room: Wow! That\u2019s one huge line! I\u2019ve never seen a hundred plus people in line to check into a hotel before. The line went quickly though, and within 15 minutes we were talking to our nice check-in clerk. Thought briefly about the $20 trick and decided against it. We had a reservation for a Palace Tower Room at $180 thanks to a post I\u2019d seen on this forum or on the Fat Wallet forum. I asked the clerk nicely if she could get us a view of the pools (while secretly hoping she\u2019d give us an Augustus room with a view of the Bellagio fountains) and also told her this was our first time in Vegas. She said \u201clet me see what I can do\u201d and started clicking away and then called someone on her phone. She then said \u201cI think you\u2019ll like this, you may not want to leave your room\u201d, but I figured she was just blowing smoke and didn\u2019t believe her. Boy was she right! Wow again! She gave us a huge 1500 s.f. suite on the 28th floor of the Palace Tower. The d\u00e9cor of the hallway to our room was so beautiful I could\u2019ve slept out there. The suite was spectacular with brand new furnishings, marble everywhere, 3 bathrooms each with their own TV, with two huge showers and a Jacuzzi tub that fit two very comfortably, a large living room with 40\u201d flat panel TV, wet bar, dining room table, great view of the Bellagio fountains around the corner of the Augustus Tower, very comfortable king bed with nice linens, etc., etc. We were stunned and just started giggling. We later learned that this room typically would cost $2,000/night and we got it for under $200! Really took the sting off of losing that $20 bet on Liverpool earlier in the afternoon. By far the nicest hotel room I\u2019ve ever seen, let alone slept in. Breakfast: was coffee and pastries from Rao\u2019s which was serviceable and reasonably priced in line with what Starbucks would typically cost. There was a huge line for some buffet which I had no interest in. Bellhop provided prompt pickup for our bags, checkout was very fast and we were immediately ushered into our taxi. Curbside checkin at the airport was very quick and I highly recommend it over waiting in the long lines at the counters.

Our room was located in the Roman Tower, which is a couple of tiers below their nicest accommodations. The room was nice enough and the bed was comfy but I felt wasn't worth anywhere near the $250 per night we were charged. Most disappointing to us was the lack of amenties - there weren't even any drinking glasses in the bathroom! If you wanted a drink of water, I guess you are supposed to either order from room service or pay $4 for a bottle of water that was available in-room. Also, there was no coffee maker in the room. Coffee was available at one of the shops downstairs near the casino for about $3.50 per cup. Of course, you could always order coffee from room service but I can only imagine how much that would lighten your wallet. In contrast, Hampton Inns have far better in-room amenities at a much lower price. The rooms at Caesars are definitely not a good value in my opinion! The public areas of Caesar's Palace were plush and impressive; the casinos, restaurants, and shopping mall (Forum Shops) were all very nice and were all what I would have expected from a kingpin property on the strip. The conference facilities were also excellent in my opinion, as was the food at the Cafe Lago buffet. We've never had a better buffet - it was really good. Cost with beverage was about $25 per person. However, several other restaurants at Caesar's are extremely high priced. For instance, we saw more than one restaurant charging $65 and higher for a steak! But you can have a meal for $25 per person at Caesar's if you look around. And I'm sure you could dine for substantially less money if you dine off of the Caesar's property. Gaming was expensive for a casual gambler like me. Most card tables started at $25/hand on weekends, though I did see the occasional $10 table. I've since learned, however, that this has become standard pricing on the strip so I guess I can't fault them for it. It just strikes me as an awful lot of money for a hand of blackjack.

My review will probably sound like alot of the others but I still wanted to share our experience! Although we knew Caesars falls a little short of newer resorts like Bellagio and Wynn, it's just one of those landmark places you have to try at least once, and we were glad we did! We stayed in the Augustus Tower and had a direct view of the Bellagio fountains - that's the way to do it! Just call a week or so before your stay if you want a particular view, most booking sites have a special request section but those aren't usually received unless it's through the hotels website. The rooms in the Augustus Tower are suite-sized, great space for familes although I wouldn't necessarily recommend bringing children here just because of the sheer size of the property. In my opinion, the Augustus rooms are nicer than the smaller rooms at Bellagio. The rooms have a large LCD TV and plenty of storage space. Beds had nice linens and were comfortable, but I wouldn't say it was the best nights sleep I've had. The bathrooms were typical Vegas; very large and lots of mable, but had nice extras like a small TV and jetted tub - great place to relax! The property itself was so enourmous it is pretty much a vacation in itself. The architecture is stunning and if you want to be in the middle of the action you really can't ask for a better location on the strip with Bellagio and The Mirage on either side of the hotel. Right off the casino is The Forum Shops, which is a must see and shop destination. From what I can tell only MGM has a larger casino. Most of it is very airy and open; the original casino hasn't changed much since its opening, which I guess can be a good or bad thing. The sports book is one of my favorites in town and I recommend the Total Rewards card, especially if you like to play slots. It's free and can't hurt! We also got discounted rates and other good stuff for signing up in the mail. There were alot of dining options here, the only place we tried was the 24 hour Augustus Cafe and Nero's. We really only ate at Nero's because it had the shortest wait. The food was fine but the restaurant is dark and very dated. The premier restaurant is Guy Savoy...much more than what we were willing to pay for food but from the looks of things it is first class all the way. The good thing about Caesars is that if you don't feel like dining in the hotel there are many other, more familiar options at the Forum Shops like the Cheesecake Factory. Then there is the nightclub PURE. Very trendy and obviously not for everyone. PURE is a popular attraction for the well heeled, celebrities, wannabes, and highly metrosexual men. It's a place to see and be seen and if you're into nightlife it doesn't get much better. Just a word of caution - while in the casino I noticed alot of low life coming from the streets looking for someone to take advantage of....and some succeeded. As for transportation, taxi rides were less than $20 from the airport. I'd recommend that over the shuttles that some travel sites try to lure you into. Our last trip to LV we stayed the the Wynn. The Wynn is my favorite and is beautiful in pretty much every way; the beds are amazing, casino is bright and the standard rooms are as large as the rooms in the Augustus Tower...but when you put together the all the history , location, grandness and the AMAZING Garden of the Gods pool...you can't beat Caesars Palace.

I called the desk and asked that housekeeping change my sheets, to which I was told that the housekeeping staff was very busy and they would get to it. They never came. While we stayed, we saw a film crew filming one of the final shows of the HBO program The Sopranos. That was a treat to see the show being filmed and James Gandolfini came over to shake hands and was very generous with his time. The casino is gorgeous and was nice to shop at, however we could have done that without having to pay for the room. The food, shops and souvenirs were ridiculously expensive, not a good value.

We picked Caesar's because of the pool upgrades that were done recently. It is fantastic. There is a large round pool with fountains in it and a statue of Caesar in the middle. Then there is a smaller pool (which, while we were there is where the kids were) and then there is a very large rectangular lap pool which almost no one used. I like to swim laps and this pool was perfect for that. Even in March all the pools were open by 8am. I'd say the only downside is how large the property is. My feet were pretty sore from just walking from the hotel room to Mesa Grill for dinner (which was delish by the way).

My complaints are minor, but include the following: 1) Taxis can only drop you off at the old and cramped casino entrance and not the nice new lobby entrance; the lobby entrance is reserved for limo's only--very pretentious. 2) The room was a bit small as mentioned before. 3) I was on hold for several minutes while trying to call the front desk (on a Sunday evening) 4) Certain extensions listed in the hotel book lead to a busy signal or an answering machine 5) One of the Player's Club signup employees was curt and rude with my Mom. Again, I had a good stay, certain amenities are good and the location is great, but for the same price I would stay at Bellagio/Wynn/Venetian or THEHotel at Mandalay Bay.", "Date": "March 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cNice room...\u201d", "Author": "pachelad", "ReviewID": "UR7010334", "Content": "I booked this hotel for a convention.

When we drove up the strip to the hotel I was like a kid at the sweet shop window glued to the bright neon lights and the sheer size of these hotels!! The number of cars and people was unreal - probably not helped by the NBA All-Star Weekend being in town - this is one time a lot of people we spoke to said it was best to avoid Vegas!!!! The entrance to Caesar's is impressive and you are thrust straight into the Palace Casino once through the doors.

Our room was room 491 on the 4th Floor of the Roman Tower - the room was only a couple of minutes walk from the elevators so not too far! The size of it was impressive, not much of a view but then again we didn't ask for a room with a view; the bathroom was splendind, huge sunken bath and an enormous shower, think the only problem (not really a problem just a minor grievance) me and my partner found about the bathroom was the fact that there was no door between the room and the bathroom - and there was an awful lot of mirrors in there too! The room comes complete with an iron, an ironing board, lockable safe (operated by swiping your credit card to open/close) and air con.

I called the hotel, and they initially refused to change my rate for the night in question. After I pushed, they finally relented. Now, my husband is a blackjack player, and while he didn't drop $100,000 that weekend, he has gotten his entire weekend \"comped\" at many other properties for the same amount of play. Caesar's gave us $300 credit for the weekend, even though we stayed four nights, ate several meals and generally partied pretty hard at the property. Also, the casino host \"was not able\" to help us get any tickets to Earth, Wind and Fire for any of the nights we were there, even though we were there 2 nights before the crowd arrived for the NBA events.

Anyway, then they gave us $50 to spend in the hotel to apologise, and gave us more room keys. The second room wasn't great as we were right above the air con unit - so I complained again and this time asked that someone come to the next room. I'd been on the road for nearly 36 hours and was desperate to find a nice room. So we were 'upgraded' - it wasn't amazing, but it was nice. We finally settled in the third room. We were only at the hotel for three nights, but it was very comfortable. Amazingly we didn't do any gambling - we shopped 'til we dropped! Caesars Palace has a fantastic shopping mall. It was probably the best one around. Unfortunately we didn't get to see/view all the hotels on The Strip, but without doubt, I think CP is the best.

For ease, we only ate within Caesars Palace shopping Mall (The Cheesecake Factory) and had several meals at the buffet restaurant in the actually hotel that over looks the pool area. The food was great and very reasonably priced. There was something for everyone. We hired a car from the Hertz desk in the hotel - it was very new, so we had a problem locating it!

We stupidly didn't know this, and wondered why everything was closing early! We saw the Grand Canyon as the sun was setting and it's truly breath taking.

We arrived fairly late on friday - around 10:30-11ish. I'll try to stick to just Caesars in my review. Check-in was easy - no line at that time. Our reservation was for a Palace tower room booked through a package promotion with a 25.00 dining credit. We were asked if we wanted to upgrade (for a price of course) and we declined. I figured the room should be nice enough & I was right. The room: We were given a room on the 19th floor with a great view of the Caesars pools. I though the room was fantastic & quite roomy. Very clean and modern. The bathroom was huge for a non-suite room. It had a giant jacuzzi tub, seperate glass shower with great water pressure. The commode was seperated with it's own door. His & her marble sinks with more than enough counter space. This is the exact bathroom I only wish I could have at home! In the hallway was a big closet with a safe, iron & ironing board. There also was a vanity here with good lighting & a make-up mirror. The room had a plasma TV, mini bar (expensive - 4.00 bottles of water which we couldn't help drinking!) , desk with its chair, velour loveseat, table & a comfy chair. We thought the bed was amazing - one of the, if not the most comfortable hotel beds we've slept in. Comparable with the Hilton, maybe better. There were extra pillows set aside in all sizes. Pillows were very comfy as well. All & all we loved our room. Room service - we used twice. The 1st time was bad. Approx 8:30 am we called for breakfast. By 9:30 no show. Called again to be told they had no order - re-ordered. Finally showed up around 10:15-10:30. When it did arrive - the presentation & food was very good. The 2nd time we ordered at night - around 11pm. Came in under 1/2 hr - great. We ordered a cheese pizza and unfortunately it was not very good - the sauce was terrible. My advice is not to order pizza from room service here. The casino: We signed up for the total rewards right away. Mostly we play backjack & the minimum was always 25.00 so we played at other properties the entire weekend. The one time I did play here I lost 100.00 in about 60 seconds. Enough of that. I did win 110.00 on a penny slot near the lobby. A slot I had no clue how to play and it took about 5 minutes to win. That made up for my blackjack loss. All weekend I had been cashing in chips from other casinos at Caesars - Flamingo & Harrahs with no problem. The last day however, I was given a slightly hard time about cashing in Flamingo chips. The woman did do it - but nothing had ever been said to me before. I guess it depends who you get. The forum shops were amazing. It had to be the most beautiful \"mall\" I've ever seen. Lots of upscale shops - and your regular stores too like the Gap. I went to Juicy Couture and bought myself a leaving Las Vegas present. We ate at the buffet twice. Once for the Champagne buffet and once for the regular breakfast buffet. Both were very good. We used the credit on our rewards cards toward one of our meals. I have to say, Caesars is really HUGE. I know a lot of the strip hotel/casinos are - but I mean huge. Thankfully, I enjoy walking. The bell service was great, friendly & prompt. Check-out was faily easy - the line was short. They applied our dining credit to room service. We loved Caesars palace to stay at - but not to gamble in because we like lower limit tables. It's very easy to cross the bridge though to the Flamingo or other casinos. We would stay here again but there are so many other hotels to try! Overall - I do highly recommend the Palace tower rooms.

We were really disappointed in the place, although the drink service in the casino was very good. Something about the property has a disorganized feel to it, kind of like someone who just keeps adding rooms to their house without an overall plan. Our room was in the Roman Tower, and it was well below average for Las Vegas. If you decide to stay at Caesars, refuse to accept a room in this tower. A few examples: in our room, #1471, one of the electrical outlets was hanging out from the wall, there was a dirty towel on the floor upon our arrival, the sheets were thin and nearly transparent, and the furniture was worn. There was a mirror on the ceiling, which was interesting. My sense of reading the other reviews and seeing the photos of the fancier towers leaves me to conclude that there is a stark difference in room quality between towers. It looks like Caesars has very nice hotel rooms, but we sure didn't get one, and I prefer not to gamble on what my room might look like. While there are nice aspects of this property, the bottom line is this: if you're not getting comped, Caesars is simply an oversized waste of money compared to the plentiful, fabulous other options available in town. If you're already planning to stay there and plan to park your own car, here's a tip. Try to avoid the entrance on the Strip, as the pedestrian traffic makes for slow progress. Along the back of all the Strip properties, there's a street called Frank Sinatra Drive, with entrances to all of the parking garages.

As I reached the Front Desk on arrival, I handed the lady $20 with my ID and credit card (as advised by one of those \"special tips\" sites telling you what you can get for doing the right thing in Vegas) and asked for a view of the Bellagio fountain - and I got a good room, right on the corner of the building with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountain! Nice. Remember: always tip everybody in Vegas, and you'll be rewarded. The room was as expected - I'm fairly used to this level of comfort, so there was nothing unusual here. The fridge was placed in the cabinet underneath the LCD-TV, and the cabinet also had some drawers for clothes. The closet had hangers enough for 8 jackets, which was good, because between my wife and I we had just that many for the 6 days we stayed there. Unfortunately, the bedding was not as nice as I wanted them to be - the sheets and pillow covers were all too crisply cleaned - they were nice and clean, but I prefer the excellent beds and sheet sets they have over at a place like the Hilton. The bathroom was just the way we like it - lots of room for both of us at the 2-sink counter, a nice jacuzzi tub to fit the two of us nicely, and a glass shower stall. I just wished that the shower was a little more powerful, but it was hot enough so it made up for the difference. But, the room was quiet, and I was able to get some excellent sleep. The room service lady was polite and would always call late enough to check to see if we wanted service. CASINO : I was actually disappointed - it used to be much better back in the day. There are not as many Machines or Tables as compared to other places like the Mirage, Bellagio, or the Wynn - in fact, the Casino floors had so much room, I wondered how the place makes money compared to the other places! But then again, Harrah's owns so many others now (Paris, Bally's, Flamingo, Rio, Harrah's) and the Total Rewards cards work at any of those other places, so it makes up for it, I guess - all you have to do is go across the street and you can have a variety of games. The dealers at the tables are very nice - but they always are extra nice especially if you're a guest at the hotel. So once you get your Total Rewards card, always say that you're a guest there, even if you're not. And make sure you tip them and put up some money for the dealer too. They treated us very well, always making sure that we were happy and entertained. That was enough for me to keep playing, even though the cheaper rated tables were at other casinos. On this trip, I broke even, so that's a good thing, as I probably amassed a lot of points on my rewards card. FOOD: The food in Caesars is a little over-priced for the quality they claim - they could knock the prices down just a tad and I think they would do much better, I think - but then again, they are trying to project that classy image, so may be they can't. And there is not enough of a variety, nor do the restaurants stay open late enough - Caesar's only has one Cafe that is open 24 hours and they choices are very limited. They ought to keep the food court area open at least until 2AM. OVERALL: Anyways, we had a decent time, got to see a couple of shows, and the New Year's Eve Fireworks was pretty good. Will I stay here again? Hmmmmm.......... there are so many other hotels to experience, so unless I get really great deal for the next time, I probably will go somewhere else - and I say that about every place I've ever been. I just like to experience different things - it's nothing against Caesars.", "Date": "January 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex, UK", "Title": "\u201cLoved Caesars & Vegas\u201d", "Author": "Curly73", "ReviewID": "UR6540240", "Content": "This was my first trip to Vegas - I went with my mum for her 60th birthday - this was her present from me and my sister. The main reason for the trip was for my mum to see Barry Manilow - I booked 3rd row tickets before going to make sure we got good seats!!! He was brilliant -want to go back again just to see Barry. Anyway onto Caesars Palace - we arrived at the hotel about 7pm and there was not one single person in the queue which was good. I asked if there was any chance of an upgrade but they said no - was pretty gutted about this as so many people had said they managed to get upgrades. We were put in the Roman tower which I wasn't very happy with as was hoping for the Augustus (!!) but when we went up there I was happy with the room. It was very spacious and had two big double beds and the bathroom was a good size with separate shower and big tub. Everyone was very friendly at the hotel. We ate at the Cheesecake Factory in the Forum Shops which was delicious. The portions are so huge me and my mum could have shared one of our meals and still not been able to eat it all. We did manage to share a piece of cheesecake for dessert though!! Also went another night just to get take-away cheesecake. You must try some - there are so many flavours though you are spoilt for choice!!! The shopping in Vegas is brilliant - we spent most of our days shopping as everything so cheap compared to London. Arrived with two empty cases and took two full ones home!! Got some good bargains at the Premier Outlet - we got the bus there which was OK even though we had to wait quite a while for the bus and you have to change buses. I must admit we didn't do any gambling at all. We are not really into gambling but I really wanted to have a go while there but we just run out of time - there is so much to do and just not enough time to fit it all in. Also wanted to do the Grand Canyon helicopter trip but we left it too late and couldn't get booked. If you want to do this I would recommend booking as soon as you get there or you could be disappointed (like me!!). We went to see Tony & Tina's wedding which was really funnny. It is on at the Rio hotel and Caesars have a free minibus that goes there every half hour or so. Would quite liked to have seen The Beatles Love show but didn't have time for this - hopefully next time. Overall I absolutely loved Vegas - and so did my mum. Can't wait to return but have promised my boyfriend he can come next time seen as he missed out on this trip. He wants to go for a big boxing match!!!

Actually, I was primarily giving Total Rewards a shot, as some fellow gambler friends insisted it treated them well. Given the Harrah's properties all over the US, I figured it'd be a good way to go as I could gamble and earn points all over (especially since there are Harrah's properties in many of the cities I travel to on business, beyond just pleasure). Mind you, Caesar's can be quite pricey for a weekend! So be wary of that! If it's a peak night (especially Friday and Saturday nights) be prepared to spend a bunch! The first time I'd stayed in an Augustus Tower room at Caesar's it was 800 for the first (Sat) night, then down to 300 for the second (Sun) night. Somewhat difficult to justify those prices for just a regular room - especially when Vegas is jampacked with wonderfully luxurious suites at other properties for the same price or less. However, I reached Total Rewards Diamond status soon after that first stay, and have been getting comped Augustus Tower rooms since then. That definitely helps! Rooms are modern, spacious with sitting area, comfortable, great beds, great bathroom. Have had a couple housekeeping issues here and there (dirty comforter... ew!) but a quick call downstairs got that sorted out right quick. Minibars, good views (especially higher floor rooms on the south side of Augustus, overlooking the Bellagio fountains), the Diamond Lounge is there in the Augustus Tower. I've definitely noticed wonderful treatment since, thanks to my Total Rewards status, and so whereas this review might not be too helpful if you're just looking to visit Vegas for a quick trip and gamble once a year or so, if you're a regular Vegas visitor/gambler, definitely give Harrah's/Total Rewards/Caesar's a shot. Caesar's is the nicest Harrah's property in Vegas (in my opinion), and it's very close to other Harrah's properties like the Flamingo, Harrah's, Bally's, Rio (via free shuttle).

We did go there to gamble (that's the only reason that you should go to las vegas) so we hit the roulette tables. We were betting at least $200.00 per hand. We ordered a glass of wine (had to ask at least 3 times) and received it only after about 30 minutes! The service continued to decline...One evening, we had reservations at Nero's for 5 PM and realizing that we may be about 15 minutes late,attempted to call the restaurant to advise. However since the restaurant only opened at 5 and we called at 4:50, we were transfered to the Hotels restaurant reservation center. When we asked them to advise the restaurant, they said that they could not contact them since they would not be answering their phone and we were strongly urged to be there on time! Not once did the attendant offer to contact the restaurant on our behalf. (even after we asked her to do so) Anyway we rushed to make it down by 5:15 only to find an almost empty restaurant. Anyway, almost as soon as we sat down, we were solicited by the photographer who offered to take photographs of us. After dinner (which was mediocre considering the $250.00 of which only $50.00 was allocated to wine) the photographer returned to offer us the possibility of purchasing the photographs. We declined. After seeing the disappointed look on her face, we decided to purchase 2 wallet size photos. Didn't change her mood much! Now's what really got to me... When we returned home, we realized that a few items were missing (namely souvenirs that we had bought for our young daughter, no big commercial value but very important to my daughter) ..after questioning our daughter, we soon found out that she had hidden them in the room and obviously we were not aware of it and immediately contacted the hotels lost and found department. We called 5 times over a 2 day period with no calls returned! I finaly tracked down someone (but only because I had called a sixth time). The gentleman was nice and said that they would attempt to contact the new room resident and get back to us. Well, they did not so I called again a day later and was told that the new resident had not called them back and since he was a \"VIP\" there was nothing more that they could do until he checked out. So what are we \"chopped liver\". Anyway, I could go on and on about the service at Caesars palace but in a nutshell, if you have some money to blow and want good service, DO NOT STAY THERE!

This hotel has a bunch of fancy resturants,which you'll need a reservation to get in,but also has cheaper places(for them) to get a bite to eat. Also has a shopping mall, but as you might expect for CP they were not cheap.We went to Celine Dion's show, and it was worth every penny we spent. My husband was not eager to go,but by the end of her 90min show he was raving about it. Did not gamble,coming from CT. I can gamble at Foxwoods or Mohegan Sun anytime,but did notice the casino's were pretty smokey. Liked that the hotel is in the middle of the Strip,but its still quite a walk to visit lots of the other casinos. And the monorail itself is a walk,would be nice if they could connect it to all the hotels. Nite time on the strip is really busy,especially on weekends. We visited Las Vegas about 15yrs ago when it was trying to be more family oriented,but certainly isn't this way know,was suprised to see young families there...I certainly wouldn't bring young kids there,but it is a good place for an adult weekend,just be sure to bring plenty of money....you'll need it!!!!

The check-in for the MGM, located nearby, was open. Seemed strange that it would be closed so early. We have reserved a room with a single queen or king bed in the Palace Tower, but found that the only avialble room had two queen beds, and very little else. So, we paid $55 to upgrade to the Augustus Tower, which is the newest tower and not yet complete. This is the most expensive of the options offered there. The room was huge (maybe 600 sq. ft.) , with a king bed, a couch, a chair with ottoman, a table with two chairs, and a bit flat screen TV. A desk and chair completed te furnishing. (Internet cable was available for $12 per 24 hour period. The furnishings, except for the bed, was more in the Roman style than designed to be comfortable. The bed was excellent. The bathroom was large with a jacuzzi tub, seperate shower, two wash basins and a seperate room for the stool. Took a call to housekeeping to figure out the shower - must pull the handle out from the wall and then adjust the temperature. Could not fiture out how to activate the tub. A call to housekeeping found that they had a manual but really no clue how to find the switch that started it. The room was nicely cleaned every day, and the bed was turned down each evening. We ate breakfast in the room - pastery and coffee arrived about 45 minutes after ordering. We played table games in the mornings as the limits were too high for our taste in the evening. The dealers were experienced, and so a bit jaded. Drinks were freely available. We ate at the Augustus Cafe, which offers s simple meat and potatoes menu, and found it a reasonable alternative - two could eat for $30 to $45. Ate breakfast at Cafe Lago, the buffet and found i acceptable, but not great, for the $16 price. Ceasar's Palace has been built over a 30 or 40 year period, so it is very spread out with hotel towers that are a long walk from the other side of the casino. It is a very 'plastic' or pretensious place, which we found not to our liking. We have stayed at several hotels in Vegas and two or three are more to our taste.

Could not have asked for two better party animals to help celebrate with me. On to the good stuff. Day1 Caesars Augustus Suite Left Ft Lauderdale non stop to Las Vegas on Usair. Arrived at 10:30 am Vegas time and met up with our friend Connie from New York who's flight got in a few minutes before ours. Met our Limo driver from Caesars and we were off. Check in was a breeze we had two rooms reserved in the Augustus Tower one comped under my card and the other comped under my wife's. Since it was my Birthday my host had ugraded my Augustus room to a corner suite over looking the Bellagio Fountain. Connies room was two floors under ours. Awesome room we loved it. Decided to go down stairs and make a deposit at the machines for the nice rooms they gave us We got some drinks and headed over to th Mirage, Wynn, and TI. After drinking and losing in all these fine places we cabbed back to Caesars to get ready for Dinner at Nero's which we never made. Had some drinks at the seahorse bar and met up with some friends we had not seen in 6 years that were in Vegas for there last night before going home. We all decided to get some more drinks and some smokes up in the suite as well as put a nice dent on my room service bill. Day2 Paris P Room Had to stay at Paris for one night as Caesars was sold out for Nicky Hilton's birthday. No problem for us as they got us shipped over to Paris in a cab. We decide to share a room for the night. Paris was nice they gave us a premium room which was so so, but who cares it was free so no complaints right. My wife and Connie went down to the pool and I went to place some action in the sports book. I played some more slots and did not make anything but donations, So I decide to fold up shop for a bit. Later that evening we went to the Rio for dinner and to play some more. We had a blast and cabbed back to Bally's/Paris at around 2 am. Day 3 Back To Caesars Palace Tower Suite Got some nice rooms in the Palace tower upon arrival back to Caesars. Both comped same way was before with one under the wife and one under me. They gave us a suite for my room and it was beautiful. The ladies went to shop in the forums and I decide to Play some slots for a bit. Stage deli for lunch was excellent. After that some more slots then dinner at Augustus Cafe before we got ready to go to Pure. Pure was a blast Connie and my wife got plasterd as did I. Think I had about 15 beers that day between playing on the slots and then Pure. But it was my last day of being 29 so I enjoyed myself. Shadows Bar after Pure for awhile, Got the ladies up stairs and decide to go play down stairs till about 4am. Had a blast. Day 4 Hyakumi and My Birthday My 30th Birthday. My wife gave me a nice present from my doggies back at home. Slots that day were on them. The ladies were feeling the night before and we did not get going until late. Margaritaville for lunch then some playing at Flamingo. I love this place for some reason. After that back to Caesars for dinner Hyakumi. My favorite Japanese restaurant in Vegas. We had a lovely dinner that our host picked up which was very nice. My host Cheryl always shows us a great time. Some more drinks for me not the ladies after dinner, and a little more gaming then up to bed for the evening as the wife was starting to get a cold. Day5 Back To Ft Lauderdale We left around 1030 pm on the red eye back to Ft Lauderdale. We had a great time on this trip. We did not win anything this time, but we had done well the time before this so no big deal.

There was no desk, and the TV was not a flat-screen or anything special. I tried to use the internet (for 12 bucks) but was never able to connect. The best things I can say was that the beds were comfortable and the room was quiet. I didn't eat at any of Caesars' restaurants. I didn't spend a dime at the tables. I saw a couple of tables with $15 minimum but the majority were $25 and up. I did play in the noon poker tournament, which I highly recommend. The poker room is a quiet oasis just off the sportsbook and the tournament room is an amazing place to play. If you are going to play just one tournament in Vegas, play it at Caesars (though I did play at TI and Harrahs as well, both of which I was more successful at).

All the staff were very polite and afficant, did not encounter any rudeness from anyone. The room was very luxurious, on 14th floor with great views of the pools (ask for a pool view, if at the palace tower.) A king bed, very over stocked mini bar, with very expensive prices to match, beware, if you so much as pick anything up you will be charged, as they work on sensors. The bathroom was superb, with huge whirlpool bath, very large, walk-in shower, and double sinks, toilettries were of a very high quality. Housekeeping was excellent and done nice and early, if you lie in, remember to put the 'do not disturb' sign out. By the pool there are as many towels as you need, so dont bother taking your own. Four pools, three 'normal' and the Venus, which is a topless pool, you have to pay for it at the end of the week.

We arrived at 11am on Sunday - which is the most popular day to arrive for conventions - and had to check our luggage with bell services, which was painless and well-managed. We spent a couple hours at one of the many bars watching the football games, then secured our room in the Palace Tower, eighth floor. The room was fairly spacy - supposedly 600 sq ft - with king bed, desk & chair, plasma tv and a very large bathroom with jacuzzi tub for two, glass shower, double vanity and separate toilet. The room was nice, but really smelled of smoke - this was supposed to be a nonsmoking floor. We called and they offered to ionize it, after also offering to move us. The ionization helped somewhat, and you got used to the smell after the first whiff upon arrival. The pool area was very attractive with lots of chairs and very friendly pool boys, but a scarcity of waitresses. The hot tubs were somewhat disappointing in that they weren't that hot and the jets weren't too powerful. There is a topless area of the pool deck which is separated by topiary, but not secluded enough for my liking. Also, on my way to a convention meeting on the ballroom floor, you can look out the windows right down to the topless area. The casino is large and confusingly laid out. I use the Bellagio as my benchmark because I love the paths they laid out through the casino to guide you. Caesar's is just too large, and to top it off, there are at least three different towers, the forum shops, Appian Way, all with bad signage. I got lost a few times.

We were also close to the swimming pools - our room view was facing them as well and they were so beautiful! We ate in their food court and it was pretty good and enjoyed a few buffets on the strip - mainly Aladdin which was the best one within walking distance. The best show was of course Celine Dion - she is incredible and the best comedy show was George Wallace! Go to the 1/2 price ticket place by the coke bottle and get a good deal on some of the shows.

Stayed there before about 10 years ago and wow its evolved way beyond how anyone could imagine. We booked everything direct with hotel. Would recommend as not only did we receive a great rate but also upgrades. Our $40 town car from the airport turned out to be a super stretch limo & our Palace Tower room was upgraded to a petit suite. The room was fantastic complete with his and hers bathrooms. Everything was luxurious and looked clean like brand new. BTW our rate was $160 per night incl Fri & Sat for 5 ngts, some kind sole posted a promo code on this site (search under prom codes or fat wallet.com). After checking out most other hotels we agreed Caesars seemed to have been a great choice. There is a real buzz about the hotel and casino which alot of the newer hotels don't seem to have for example one min we were chatting to Pete Rose, then tow mins later we were standing besides Sandra Bullock ! When we arrived Prince & Justin Timberlake had just arrived at the Pure nightclub....life in the fast lane. See attached pics of the pool taken from a heli tour...yes the pools are great. Some tips if you are planning a trip: - search this site & fat wallet for promo codes and book direct. - stay in a Palace Tower or Augustus Tower room (PT has easier access to pools) - Found no line at hotel check in (7.30pm Fri night). If you book a limo book with hotel & ask driver what the check in line is like as you can check in at the airport. - Forum shops are fantastic ...suggest you keep a close eye on your wife ! - We booked tickets to \"O\". The restricted view tickets are $93.50 buts theres really no difficulty seeing everything on stage (people next to you will be paying $150). Theres a great pre theatre menu at in the Bellagio at FIX restaurant at $40 per head. Great meal. - our anniversary dinner was at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.

The bed linens were not luxurious, but it didn't really matter since we didn't spend much time sleeping. The bed was firm, which we like. The Forum Tower was close to the Forum shops and the Coloseum where Celine performs. We visited the pool area on Saturday morning, but did not swim since it was a little too chilly. Caesars has an awesome pool area. There seemed to be lots of lounges available, but, as I said, it was chilly. We did have drinks at the pool bar. My hubby had a Bloody Mary and I had a Pina Colada. It was the best Pina Colada I had ever had. We felt that Caesars had one of the best casinos of the ones we saw. Granted, we were only there from Friday to Sunday.

The property is beautiful and every staff memeber we encountered was very nice, something you often don't find at large properties. The only problem was at check-in they did not have any rooms with 2 beds left, so we had to upgrade to a executive suite, which only had 1 king bed plus a sleeper sofa. However, the hotel waived the upgrade fee and we were able to switch rooms the next day, so it worked out. The pool is great-very spread out, but get there early to get a chair. The pool staff is very friendly. We did get stuck with a terrible waitress who never once waited on us, so that was disappointing. And it did seem like they were short staffed b/c it looked like it took a long time to get drinks. We did go to Shadow, a fun lounge and PURE one night and it was amazing. We skipped the line and were let right in (group of 4 girls). The music selection was out of this world and everyone was having a great time. We also had the breakfast buffet and it was really good and very reasonable. We went at 9:30 and only had to wait maybe 15 mins. for a table. We also ate a few times at the food court inside Caesar's which was great when you are on the go and don't feel like having a sit down meal. Housekeeping was a little slow at times, but nothing to get upset about. We were there to have fun and we did, thanks to a great stay at Caesar's.

We both got high level rooms in Palace Tower. I had paid for 2 rooms, as I didnt want to share with my kids. We got connecting (great as I didnot know US hotels did these), both had two bathrooms, two wc (four in all - one each !!!), huge shower. Floor to ceiling windows overlooking pool, with fountains in distance. WATCHOUT for mini bar, you are charged if you even BREATH on an item, even the stuff on top, on desk - they all sit on sensors, touch it, move it, and you get charged. $4 for a kitkat!. They will cancell charge once someone has been up to check it, a real pain though. If long stay, get them to empty bar. Beds VERY COMFY, duvets weigh a tonn though. Wall Plasma great for kids. Pools great for adults but boring for kids, they will tollerate a ball, but you feel like a lepper bringing kids to this hotel. Unless in the shops. Boy the shopping Mall is so classy - make sure you see ALL the animated shows and statues. Us the Mall to get further up the strip, saves on road crossing a a/c all the way. Food, use the hotel buffet, as stated $14 bkfts (kids $7), $18 Dinner - great, but lines can develop. We went Midweek, so guess weekend much worse (no room upgrades at weekends). We too trecked down to other buffets, not worth the $2 saving. It takes ages to walk anywhere in Vegas, everyhting looks close by - it aint. Soo many road crossings - dont J Walk !!!, so many crowds. Expect half your time to be walking/waiting for crossing signals. For kids buy Gater-aide - like UK Oasis, or they will only drink Soda. Buy it at the 7Eleven, huge bottles for what you pay for a tiny bottle elsewhere, they only place to get ice drinks too (crushed ice flavoured). Wear hats all day/suncream, you can get seriously burnt just walking for 10 min. LV is great for kids, just choose your entertainment carefuly. See the fountains at least 3 times, always different routine, great at night. Kids can walk through casino with adult, but must not stop. Do prebook shows at ticketmaster, kids will adore Mystere, its soo funny. There is a McD overroad at exit of Forum Mall -unlimited soft drinks!!, and a/c too.

There was a full-sized velour sofa, chair and footstool in the room along with two end tables and a cocktail table. There was no typical \"desk\" like you see in other hotels. The tv was 27\" (wish it were bigger!) and was ensconsed in armorie which had drawers at the bottom to hold your clothing. The closet had dual wooden doors which opened to reveal a large closet complete with safe (the safe was opened and closed using the swipe of your own credit card - no more having to remember combinations!) The bathroom was outstanding! There was a small television attached to the wall beside the large vanity/sink. There was a separate glass walk-in shower which had a place for sitting or shaving. There was a separate tub and a partially closed off area where the commode is located. There was actually a telephone mounted on the wall next to the toilet paper hanger. The pools were wonderful! I think there were 4 of them - one even allowed \"topless\" sunbathing. It was surrounded by tall hedge and there were staff members there to ensure no underage customers wondered in. It is recommended to get there early to get one of the better chairs and to snag a towel. The last day we were there they actually ran out of towels!

Furthermore our room looked out over the top of the Forum where Celine sings, and the only strip lights were those of the Flamingo. There were no towels in the room, the hallway was dirty. We watched the same orange M&M move up and down the hallway for the two nights we were there. I had to call about the maid cart and garbage all over the hallway (and they still missed that M&M.) The worst part was there are no coffee brewers in the rooms. This may not matter to some, but if I could have coffee intravenously fed to me in the morning - I would do it. There is room service AND then and additional charge for your cup of $2.50 and any one else's. I was told at the desk that NONE OF THE ROOMS had coffee makers. However, you can dry your hair and iron your pants for free. The full beds looked like the masses had slept in them. There was a dissolving Flinstone vitamin under the bed with lint bunnies. The sheets and blankets are OLD. The plus side of that is that we were comped $100.00 and ate at the Lago which was a solid \"10\" for foodservice. Actually, eat desserts anywhere - and, ask for Andrew M. at the front desk and Tommy at the Bell desk - there are some excellent staff representatives. The conference center is very nice, at least an 8, with two exceptions. Again, Caesar's skimps in the food department. The fruit was at least a day old and cut up (but I finally got coffee).

Harrah's Casino was fun, but a lot of truly \"drunk\" people.

We got a good deal on Southwest which was both air and hotel included. After reviewing all the hotels online, we decided to go with Caesars Palace. CHECK IN Check in at Caesars was a long line. There were probably at least 40 people ahead of us (this was around 2 pm on a Monday) but luckily since there were so many check-in people, the line moved fast. And to our very good fortune (or hotel karma!) we were upgraded to the penthouse level in the Palace Tower. PALACE TOWER The Palace Tower is the 2nd newest tower. While far from the casino, its elevators were directly across from the main entrance to the pool which was convienent. Plus it was a good location for easy access to the Forum Shops and Cypress Marketplace. PENTHOUSE SUITE Obviously with a suite, the review can't be that bad. The suite was amazing. Complete with living room, dining room, his and hers bathroom along with a full guest bathroom. It was very luxurious and very nice. Plus all the Aveda products were great. Perks included a large jacuzzi, 2 head shower, tvs in the bathroom and a very comfortable bed. The view wasn't spectacular. It was also very quiet being that we were on the 28th floor (out of 29 floors). DINING We ate once at the Augustus Cafe which is located near Augustus tower (the newest one) and the lobby. The food was good although a bit overpriced but we learned that was the case for everything! We also found the Cypress Marketplace, a fancy name for a food court. They had a coffee house, hot turkey/comfort food, fish and chips, burgers, chinese, pizza, build your own salad and wraps. The prices were better here. This is a good place if you want something easy that won't break your wallet. We also had the lunch buffet at the Cafe Lago (it was around $21/person). Luckily we got there in time when they were still making eggs to order. Both the omelet and eggs benedict were great. The selection for the buffet was great from shrimp to crab to prime rib to sushi to hand tossed salad and a great variety of desserts. This was a very good buffet. If you can wake up late enough to visit the buffet, you can save by eating both breakfast and lunch at the same time! If we had had the time, I would have liked to try Spago. ATMOSPHERE Obviously you can smoke almost anywhere in Vegas which took some time getting used to. We wandered in a lot of hotels but we felt that Caesars was by far one of the more smoky hotels. Almost everywhere in the hotel, someone was lighting up. Perhaps it was the circulation of the air, but other hotels didn't seem to smell as much. OTHER The pools were great - it was great that they had 3 of them. They even have a pool for \"european\" sunbathing. I also liked that they had the Forum Shops which is essentially like a mall. They had all the stores there, too many in fact! I don't think I got to see them all. They had high end stores all the way down to places like Express and the Gap. Be sure to check out the Bellagio fountain show at night. It was fantastic. The water in our \"minibar\" was priced at $4 a bottle. A total rip off! We walked down the strip toward CVS (there's also a Walgreens across the street) at Monte Carlo where you can easily buy six bottles of water for $4. It's also a good place to stock up on snacks, etc. If you are traveling around to other hotels that are far from CP, I'd get an all day bus pass. Just find the bus stop and ask the bus driver for a pass (need exact cash). This can get you from one end of the strip to the other and even to the Stratosphere or downtown.

First of all, let me state that the experience overall was satisfactory. It was far from perfect however. Allow me to list the positives and negatives. Positives: (1) Location: The location of Caesars Palace (henceforth referred to as \"CP\") is excellent. In the middle of Las Vegas Blvd (aka \"The Strip\") you are within walking distance to most of the major attractions and resorts on the Strip. In terms of Strip resorts, CP probably has one of the best locations (along with the Mirage, Venetian, Bellagio and Paris Las Vegas). Centrally located and in the center of all the action/activities. (2) Staff: The staff of CP was professional, diligent, competent and eager to serve. They really took care of our needs with a courteous and friendly attitude. The staff at CP is top notch! I can't say enough good things about them. I would also like to note that while there were issues with our room (see Negatives), the maid made sure our room was clean and tidy every day. (3) Forum Shops: The Forum Shops at CP are excellent with stores and restaurants that can fit every price range. Just walking through the shops is an experience in itself. I highly recommend checking out CP's Forum Shops, even if you aren't staying at the actual resort. Negatives: (1) Room Issues: Our room was located over one of the nightclubs (Shadow Lounge) so at night, we could feel the bass beats and hear the music through the floor. We had to turn on the television to a music station so it would block out the club noise. Also, our toilet tended to make noises at night which also added to the 'negatives' of the room. It seemed that it was 'always running.' (2) Casino: I am a regular visitor to Las Vegas and I do engage in gambling. I do not like the casino at CP. There seems to be a shortage of table games and what they do have is, in my opinion, overpriced. Even on a Sunday morning or Thursday early-afternoon, the tablegames (especially blackjack and craps) were too expensive. This is subjective and just my opinion. The minimum price I found for the average tablegame was $25. The 'old' casino area (with the majority of the craps, roulette and tablegames) tended to be very crowded.

However, the toilet in the room kept \"bubbling\" and made \"gurgling\" noises in the middle of the night. While not in use, some water would randomly splash out as well onto the toilet seat and floor. My spa experience was mediocre. I was not given a tour of the facilities and the changing area was really crowded. I did not think the massage was worth $135 and felt compelled to tip more than I wanted to because my therapist waited for me to tally the total charged to my card. The fitness area was nice as well as the pool area.

I booked this trip through travelocity and we paid for the most \"standard\" room offered. When we arrived we were upgraded to the palace tower, which was beautifully decorated and a plasma tv. We decided to take advantage of the spa, which i recommend to only do if you are in desperate need of a massage. Its really not worth the $135 per person ( 50 minutes). The food and drinks were great and the pool was really nice. If you like to shop, make sure you check out the forum- lots of designer. Overall we had an amazing time and would stay at the Caesars again. FYI: Do not get swindled by the cab drivers. Please request that they take the Swenson Ave. route from the airport to the hotel- averaging $13.00. If they take the tunnel, the ride will cost you $25.00. We learned the hard way!

I drove in from LA area and had to pick someone up at the airport so while I was there I checked in. There were only 3 people in line and it went very quickly. One room was ready on the 9th floor but the other on the 10th floor was not. I commented with a smile that I only need one room now as I need to decorate and set-up for a \"bachelorette weekend\". She then told me she had another room that was not \"non-smoking\" but it was on the 26th floor and wouldn't be ready until 4 or 5 but it was a better room if I wouldn't mind waiting. I happily took the room. When we got to the hotel I valeted my car and a bellman promptly brought my SEVEN bags of \"party supplies\" up to my room and then came back two hours later to move it to the other room. Same bellman, smiling and friendly the whole time and even gave us some short cuts to get from one room to the other. I did make a second run at 10pm to the airport to pick up my bacherlorette. When we got to the hotel valet was full. I pulled up and nicely asked if I could still leave my car I was already checked in. The valet gentleman paused for one second and then said with a smile that he would take my car, he hailed a bellman who again took our bags quickly to our rooms. Quick, efficient and friendly all the way. The rooms were beautiful and the bathrooms glamorous. The beds were very comfortable especially with the down comforters and pillows. The petite suite was awesome as it had two bathrooms that were joined by a double shower. Great for 4 girls to get ready in to hit the town. On Saturday, we had a cabana reserved at the Neptune pool and were told we were lucky that we hadn't been bumped by the casino as a lot of other groups had. I don't know why we were so lucky but I booked early so maybe that helped. The cabana was perfect. The misters kept us comfortable even though it was at least 114 degrees that day and our cabana host, Laurie, was incredible. She was very friendly and kept us stalked with cold water, sodas, fresh fruit, chips and pretzels, ice, cups and towels that were all included. When she brought the bill it was for $325 and I told her that I was quoted $275, she said that they had just raised the prices but if that is what I was quoted then that's what I would pay so she promptly fixed the bill. The drink and food service around the pool was very quick and friendly. Everyone we met during our stay was helpful, friendly and professional. Except for the a limo tour of Vegas and visit to see the chippendales which was magnificient (we never made it to the club, bumme,r but oh well) we never left the hotel.

We had the same Irish Oatmeal which is distinctive in texture in one of the same resort's restaurants -- no comparison -- it was just fine. And, that is the problem -- there is no consistency or attention given to the level or delivery of service. I tried to buy a souvenir from one of the shops that was marked $8, but it rang up for $10. The girl at the register tried to tell me that if I wanted it that I had to pay $10. Before she \"obliged\" me by calling her manager, she pulled off one of the tags in effort to accuse me of retagging the item -- the tag under it said $8 as well. Finally, a manager told her to give me the discount. DUH! No apology for the overcharge or insult. This attitude of overcharging is the norm and must come from the top on down. The hotel offers NOTHING for free. Use of the gym is $25 per day, use of a wireless connection is $12 per day -- no coffee pot in the room. Had to ask them to bring up an ironing board, which should have been in the room to begin with, and the housekeeping delivery person loudly complained that I did not tip for them restocking my room with this essential. On to the casino: I did not know that Las Vegas had turned into a family destination with children on the casino floor. I also did not know that gambling was legal for those under 21 years of age. The slot machines were so tight that the only screams you heard were from drunk frat boys videotaping their antics on the casino floor, or the loud wailing of infants in strollers as their mothers played the slots. What a disgrace -- I will not be returning to Caesar's Palace (or the Strip) anytime soon. And, yes, I did lose at the slots like everyone else, but this is not sour grapes. I was entirely disgusted by my experience at Caesar's Palace -- would have been even if I had won $200 (which was probably never likely to happen there anyway...) Lest you think me completely negative -- the pool area is very beautiful and well-maintained with nice thick towels.

In the \"old days\" if you booked a suite you were all but assured of quality attention and service. However, with 3,000 rooms at many of the hotels, it now takes an army to clean rooms and provide service all the while more planes are landing with more people anxious to check in. Rather than bash Caesars, let me offer some advice about vacationing in Las Vegas. Always stay at the most exclusive hotel that you can afford in the most room that you can afford, even if it means not having as long of a trip The reason is that those rooms (i.e. you too!) seem to receive the most attention. Also, no matter how tired you are, always smile and speak to the desk clerk as though he/she is the most important person you will meet that day. Speak to them by using thier name and asking how they are doing that day. Try to get them to smile. Believe me, at the time of check-in, they can set you up nicely (upgrade) or send you into the \"back of coach class\" with the click of a mouse. More advise, DRESS the part. If you are checking into a junior suite, look and act like you belong there. Nothing looks more stupid than a person complaining about this and that while looking like they got off of a banana boat booze cruise. Try to set your arrival on a Sunday or Monday. Show some appreciation by tipping for good service. 90% of any problem can be solved by knowing how to speak to people. You will be amazed how well you are treated if you are courteous.

Because it's Las Vegas, the trip was obviously a blast. Our opinion of Caesar's, however was more modest and mixed. The four of us are all between the ages of 40 and 46. The girls were primarily looking for a vacation with good restaurants, a nice relaxing pool, a spa, and some nightlife. The boys wanted to do it all. Three of us had been in Caesar's before, but none had actually stayed there. First the plusses. Caesar's and it's affiliate hotels have an airport check in. Not all of the resorts do. But it can be very hard to find in the airport. Depending upon when you arrive, you will probably be better off trying to check in at the airport than at the front desk of the resort. They will try to sell you a ride on their shuttle for $6 a person. I suggest passing. A cab ride for 4 to the hotel costs about $16-17 with tip. The pool is fantastic. If you like \"European\" style bathing (topless) they have a separate adults only pool that is divided off of the main pool complex by some vegetation. There are drink servers always available (quite attractive) and you can get extra towels if you ask. The drinks are $6 for a beer, $11 for a mixed drink like a mai tai. You can charge them to your room if you bring your room charge card with you. The complex itself is enormous. There are plenty of spots to gamble. A lot of high end shopping in the Forum Shops district. The sports book is the \"NORAD\" of Las Vegas sports books and shouldn't be missed if you are into that sort of thing. The service by Caesar's employees was good. All were pleasant and friendly. No complaints. For poker players, the new poker room is gigantic and well run. However, it was generally dead during the 4 days we were there. Play on no more than about 1/2 to 2/3 of the tables in the main room, at most, during most of the day and night. Really died out during the 2-3 hours around dinner. Others have told me the room is generally more active. Our rooms were average. I've stayed in nicer at the MGM, Mirage and Aladdin. Absolutely no view, but I don't go to Vegas to sit in my room and stare out the window, so I have no real objection regarding the rooms. I do have an objection regarding the room service. The first two days we were there our room was not cleaned until after 5 pm. This is totally unacceptable. Then the last morning we were there, the room service attendant came bouncing in at 7:45 am. This got a big \"thumbs down\" from this Roman. We were also disappointed in the restaurant/bar situation at Caesar's. The first night we ate at Spagos. Food was fine, but not spectacular. Service was excellent. Wine was grossly overpriced (but not the food). We ended up eating the other two nights at the Venetian and Hamada's, off the strip. But our biggest complaint, and the reason we all agreed we wouldn't go back, is the nightclub/bar/lounge situation. After our nights out eating, or going to shows, we all wanted to just return to Caesar's, sit in a bar or lounge, and have some cocktails and talk. Forget about it. First, some of the spots simply closed down around midnight, even on a Friday and Saturday night. But a bigger problem is that there will be no spots available. If your idea of a Friday night is to put on your Lebron James \"third\" jersey, your powder blue truckers cap, oversized Nike's and 48 lbs. of jewelry and \"roll\" with your pals, Caesar's is the place to go for you. The half a dozen locations in the complex that will still be open at midnight are for 50 cent and Ludacris fans only. No drinking, just standing around looking cool. At Caesar's you will observe odd situations like a bar with 50 people at it, one bartender, and no one purchasing a cocktail. Instead, everyone stands around with their cellphone plastered to their ear, scoping out the others doing the same thing. We did go into Pure one night, but I can only describe that as lame. They've got an act they call the Pussycat Dolls who leap up on a stage and dance around for a couple of minutes in skimpy outfits. But they do it in an area \"reserved\" for people other than you or me. You can try to look around a corner to see what is going on as you nurse your $10 beer. The only benefit is that you aren't directly in front of the speakers spewing their godawful \"singing.\" I had heard that Las Vegas is developing a bit of a \"gang\" problem down on the Strip. In fact, the weekend we were in town there were apparently some confrontations at the MGM. I can see that Caesar's is on their way to the same situation. For my money, I recommend the Mirage. It's right next door so you get the benefit of the same great location Caesar's has. The basic rooms are nicer, the pool is great and the atmosphere will probably be a little more to your taste if you have outgrown the 20-something scene.", "Date": "April 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cUnbelievable!\u201d", "Author": "BrettT", "ReviewID": "UR5010637", "Content": "Just returned from a weekend stay in the Augustus Tower 4/21-4/23.

Granted, both stays were on very slow days, which equalled super-low rates and no long waits anywhere. With that said, I'd like to remind everyone that this fabulous hotel/casino opened in 1966. Not 1996 or 1999, but Nineteen hundred & sixty-six. It cracks me up when people pitch fits about a hotel room not being up to their luxury standards when it's almost the same age as they are, or older. For the age of the hotel, I think it's remarkable that it's in such good condition. Caesars deserves to be commended for only utilizing the wrecking ball in a significant capacity when they added on the mall and the newest Augustus Tower. Specifics on the accommodations, you say? Well, on the first stay, I was in the Forum Tower in a \"Jacuzzi Room,\" which translates to a 70s-ish room with a mirror on the ceiling above the bed, and a large, I mean LARGE, circular tub in the bedroom. Yes, there was no wall between the bathroom and the bedroom, but I'm an odd soul who likes to play \"If These Walls Could Talk\" in my head alot of the time, so I found the room quite charming overall. I have to admit that I felt like I was taking a shower in a nursing home bathroom, what with the wrap-around curtain in the big circular tub (which did not have any Jacuzzi jets--this room was built in '74, I believe...). But there was a separate water closet and the vanity had 2 sinks and the requisite marble all over the place, so I was pleased. What flabbergasted me was (a)how incredibly heavy the door was to the room (in case there's a fire, according to the bellman), and (b)how the halls look like they haven't been touched/redone since they were built. According to other Vegas travellers I've talked to, this old-feeling, back-in-time-looking detail is referred to as \"Las Vegas charm.\" So I discounted that solely for that reason. On my second visit last August, again on a very slow day, the check-in line @ the airport was unusually long, so I went ahead to the hotel and checked in there. I checked in the next-to-last day that they were still at the old front desk right inside the main casino, and things were a bit \"transitional\"-looking. But the desk clerk was as sweet as could be (as had been the other one in December), and I told her I didn't care what kind of room I had as long as it wasn't smokey. This time I was in the Roman Tower, which I believe was built in '69 or so (the Centurion Tower is the original '66 tower). I'd heard that this tower had been totally renovated, and the room showed much proof of that. This room was what I'd call a junior suite, in that it was a good deal larger than the normal room, and it also had a separate walk-in shower and Jacuzzi tub (with jets!!) in the nice, walled-in bathroom. There was one main sink and another lower, vanity-style sink (with a chair to sit in, I guess for ladies mostly), and also the water closet. This room had a perfect view of the Garden of the Gods pool(s) area (I took a tip back down for the front desk clerk to thank her), and the window to the \"faux balcony\" was open. WARNING: Don't try to climb out the window onto the walled-in ledge of the building!! Not that most people would be idiotic enough to try this, but I did and I swear I thought I wasn't going to be able to get back in b/c the window's so high off the floor. The only downside to the room was that the Jacuzzi \"timer button\" was on the wall as you go into the bathroom--in other words, you had to turn it on and then run around the corner to keep the water from spraying everywhere, unless you had the tub really, really full before the jets turned on. There was also a small flat-screen TV in the bathroom, which was fun, but not very practical, in my humble opinion. Overall, this property has everything going for it--location, classic Las Vegas vibe, wonderful pool/outdoor hot tub oasis, and The Forum Shoppes attached. People can complain until the cows come home about the dated rooms and the long lines and the smokey casino, and the answer that I'd give them is, \"Go to the Venetian, Paris, MGM, Mirage, etc. and see if you don't find the same issues there in one form or another.\" People are flocking in herds to Vegas now, and as long as the hotels can fill the rooms most every night, there's not going to be time to renovate (until the older rooms are hurting their business alot). I work at an extremely large hotel myself and that's exactly the situation we're in right now, trying to renovate 1500+ rooms without losing business. You've now got Bellagio (the first and only 5-diamond hotel in Vegas) and the Wynn giving the \"older\" hotels a run for their money, not to mention the dozen or so other hotels being built and planned on the Strip. Competition=Renovation, it's that simple. But the rates are going to continue to rise as long as people are willing to pay them, and the smoking's going to continue, even in non-smoking rooms, until people realize that second-hand smoke really does kill. I'll get off my soap box now and add that as far as the food goes in Caesars, I personally feel it's much more worth it to walk over to Bellagio's buffet, or to one of the cafes @ Paris, or even to take a cab to one of the \"old school\" places downtown, where they do still actually have meals under $10, like old Vegas used to be famous for. Hope I've covered everything here, and I might add that it pays to be gracious to the desk clerk who checks you in. A nice attitude and a non-fakey greeting, even after waiting in a long line, can go a long way, for both the desk clerk and the guest. The infamous $20 trick never hurts, either!!", "Date": "March 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cLOVED THIS PLACE!\u201d", "Author": "Mediamonkey", "ReviewID": "UR4591055", "Content": "I loved Caesar's.

The mid-strip location is very convenient for getting around to other establishments and the hotel is very easy to navigate around and it's also easy to access the street. We booked what they call a petite suite, but which is referred to a studio suite on their website, which was in the Palace Tower & consisted of 2 bathrooms, a bedroom area, and a living area. It was clean and well kept throughout our visit. Bath 1 had a spacious counter around the sink, water closet, and access to the double shower stall shared by both baths. Bath 2 had the same but was larger, including a two person jacuzzi tub. There were two large closets which included a safe (a teeny gripe was that it was not of sufficient size to accomodate our small notebook computer). The bed was extremely comfortable with nice linens but the pillows had little substance which made them flat & uncomfortable (piling them up with the extras delivered at request by housekeeping alleviated the problem). A TV armoir provided four additional large drawers of storage. The living area consisted of a couch, armchair, coffee table, and desk. All were acceptable but we did find it odd and annoying that the internet connection was cabled into the TV armoire, requiring us to run the cable over the the desk to use it. Overall, the service we received ranged from good to very good. Airport check in was a snap & the staffers there were very friendly. Likewise with checking out at the hotel desk upon our departure, where the staffer quickly handled applying our comps to the bill & provided updated paperwork in a flash. The housekeeping staff did a good job of keeping up the room each day & provided turn down service with chocolate \"gold\" coins in the evening. We ordered from room service a total of three times and thought the food, speed of delivery, and service provided to set up/take away the carts was very good. We actually didn't find the casino to be one of our favorites. It was unbearably smoky most evenings and always crowded, plus we didn't have great luck with our money. After enjoying Paris' casino one evening, we tended to be drawn back by the good atmosphere, service, and luckier gambling. They are affiliated with Caesar's so the comps still applied to our stay which was great! Having stayed at the Venetian, we much preferred Caesar's overall. The room was similar, if a bit older, and had the advantage of the additional baths, shared shower, & jacuzzi and about three times the closet space. It was easy to get in/out of the hotel and to/from our room, without feeling as though we had navigated a labyrinth each time as we did at the Venetian. The only real complaint we had with Caesar's is that there is only one location to grab a quick cup of coffee in the morning and it was a hike from the room and usually had long, slow moving lines.

I booked a package that included an upgraded room (Palace Tower) and a $25 gift debit card. I was assigned room # 2731 in the Palace Tower which is considered a mid-grade room. My room was over 500 square foot and came with a king sized bed with down duvet and a marble bathroom with a two person soaking tub. According to the bellman who checked us in, the rooms on the 27th floor had just been renovated and our room was in excellent condition. The room had new carpet and a fresh interior. Our room looked out over the parking lot so please book an even numbered room if you prefer a pool view. Now for the problems. Within five minutes of checking in our room the half door that covers the heating vent fell of its hinge. A call to housekeeping corrected the problem almost immediately. Several days later we woke up to a room without hot water. That morning numerous guests were complaining in the elevator about the lack of hot water in their rooms. The problem was fixed later that day. When I eventually checked out of the hotel I mentioned our problems to the front desk agent. She said she could do nothing for us. I replied: \"Wrong answer!\" The front desk manager did do the right thing and gave us a $50 breakfast comp to the Augustus Cafe. I did dine at the Palm Steakhouse and had a good meal with great service. Our server even waived the corkage fee on two bottles of collectible California Cabernet I had brought from my cellar. Yes, he got a large tip for that. I also had tickets to the Jerry Seinfeld Show which were expensive and he was funny. Be aware that about 40% of his stand-up routine I had heard several years earlier at a different venue. Overall I enjoyed my stay at Caesars. To their credit when a problem arose they took care of it to my satisfaction.

The one odd thing was that there was not closet, rather there was an any area in the bathroom to hang your clothes. In this area, behind the door, there was also a safe and place to store a bag. No big deal. Also, no mini-bar in the room, but not a concern w/ me. All of the employees where professional and nice, and responsive when necessary.

Everybody I encountered (casino staff, wait staff, cleaning staff, front desk, concierge) were friendly and efficient. Airport check in very convenient. I had to wait a few minutes for check in because of a computer glitch, and the very pleasant desk person upgraded my room at no charge because of the (minimal) wait. Great bathroom with jacuzzi tub and lovely toiletries. Minuses: The buffet at Cafe Lago is just horrible. It's small and the choices are minimal, and very very mediocre. Avoid that and if you want buffet go down the street to the Mirage, it has a much better buffet for the money. I don't expect Caesars to be cheap, but I do expect value for my money. The breakfast buffet had smoked salmon, tomatos, capers, onions, cream cheese, lots of breakfast pastries but no bagels. When I asked where they were I was informed the server would bring me one. He certainly did bring me one, a nice toasted bagel: at an additional $3 upcharge I was not made aware of until the bill came. I think for 18 dollars, when the buffet contains bagel accoutrements, it should also include bagels. The Cypress Street Marketplace is good for a quick and inexpensive (the term inexpensive being relative) bite to eat, although even here, which is basically a food court environment, the setup is such that a server brings you a napkin and your cutlery, so that you're forced into an additional tip in what should functionally be a fast food area. However, the made to order salad was fresh, tasty and huge for 8.95, and I also enjoyed a hot smoked turkey plate with mashed potatos and green beans for 8.95 as well. But by the time you add a $3 drink and another $2 tip, you're up to $15 in the blink of an eye. The Augustus Cafe was also good for a quick bite, with good sized portions. Plan to spend a minimum of $20 here. There is a good range of other restaurants, most requiring reservations, that had good menu choices but at high prices. The slots are tight and the table stakes are high. Unless you are playing $5 slots or are playing very early in the morning or very late at night, you stand a better chance of seeing the Easter Bunny than you do a cocktail waitress. The nightclubs are rowdy and raucous. Very few places to have a quiet drink with friends or colleagues. As in most casinos, the sundries shops charge excessively for things like bottled soda or water, snack items, etc. I recommend keeping your water bottle, bringing some of those single serving drink flavorings and keeping yourself hydrated from the tap without spending nearly $3 every time you turn around. The forum shops area is exquisitely decorated with blue sky rotundas and gorgeous fountains, and are fun to walk through but its doubtful that many of us just plan to run into Versace, Rolex or Gucci to pick up a little something. I can recommend Penhaligons for excellent English perfumes that can't be found often in the US, starting at $60. If you search really hard there is a Bath and Body Works and a Gap in the Forum Shops. What you won't find amongst the hundreds of stores is a bookstore: I guess Caesars doesn't want you spending your valuable casino time in reading :) Generally speaking I found it a nice property if a bit overpriced to the point of annoyance.", "Date": "December 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milford, DE", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Experience\u201d", "Author": "corsdad", "ReviewID": "UR4155600", "Content": "Arrived in Vegas (first time there) Thanksgiving afternoon (after a 5 hr delay in Philly, but that is another story!) for a 20th anniversary celebration.

While Wynn probably wins out marginally based on details and quality of furnishings, you get a slightly larger and jetted tub at Caesars, and you can get a great view of the Bellagio water show. We also feel that Caesars' location is stronger than Wynn. You can go straight from check-in to your room; being able to avoid walking through the casino every time was a perk that we underestimated. If you are looking for an all-in-one hotel and money is not an issue, I would give the nod to Wynn (or the Bellagio), as the quality of the bars and the restaurants is higher than Caesars. On the flip side, Caesars (with the Forum Shops) offers a wider range of food choices, from cheap (e.g., La Salsa) to expensive (e.g., Bradley Ogden). While Caesars' Forum Shops are a nice plus, the Fashion Show Mall is directly across the street from Wynn. Although the casino ambiance at Wynn is more upscale than Caesars, we enjoy the \"Vegas\" feeling at Caesars. Dealers at both casinos tended to be nice and helpful. The on-line pictures of the hotels at both casinos are accurate representations of what you can expect to see.

There is an extremely long check-in/check-out counter in the registration lobby but it was seriously under-staffed. We joined the snake line and shuffled along with our cases a few paces every ten minutes or so. At the end of the line we were greeted by a hotel rep who thanked us for our patience and told us to \"Smile\" - which we might have done if there had been more staff to check people in faster. Only once during our week there did we see the costume characters of Caesar, Cleopatra and a couple of Gladiators. It would be far easier to \"SMILE\" if these characters came and entertained the guests in the long line ups at Reception!! Our room was a disappointment as the brochure said Deluxe but it was in fact a Standard - with no coffee maker and no view, also other missing perks the brochure mentioned. Our travel agent is looking into this for us. There were seven hangers between two of us so I asked the maid for more and she gave us plenty - but unfortunately the hooks were too small to go over the rail !!! The bars were VERY noisy and one had to shout to have a conversation. The service was not very good in the Piano Bar. Two other points - we found the Forum Cafe - exit the hotel into the Forum Shops, walk a few yards and down the escalator - sharp left - you get great coffee and bagels for breakfast (seeing there is no coffee maker in the room!!) But if you dine at Bertolinis - be warned - if you get a waiter called Rufus - he will not offer you iced water but ask if you would like bottled water and thus charge you about $7 when we noticed other tables got the choice of iced or bottled water. Ho took his time at bringing us the bill but took pains to explain the tip was NOT included!!! However the food was great. What we enjoyed most was seeing the new hotels and stores that had been built since we were there in 1999. We saw four shows - Barry Manilow was great but 90 minutes was certainly not long enough for the price of the tickets. Even Manilow said \"You paid that much for a ticket - holy ----!!\" So Mr. Manilow if you are so shocked - reduce your prices!! Legends in Concert at the Imperial was excellent and for under $50 we got a buffet meal and front row seats! The performers were superb. We saw We Will Rock You - also a good show set to Queen's music. This was on at the Paris Hotel - that place is amazing, and may be our choice hotel next time. But the best one was Tony and Tina's Wedding - that is an interactive show where the audience are guests at the wedding - it's an absolute riot and I'd go again in a minute! This was at the Rio Hotel and the carnival show that goes round in carriages and boats suspended on rails from the ceiling is truly awesome! I'm saving for my next trip to Las Vegas!

Since this was our first time, we planned to stay mainly on the Strip. We wanted a centrally located hotel/casino, good quality but not super-expensive, with a nice pool that would still be open in mid-October, and if possible a \u201cclassic\u201d Las Vegas property with a glitzy theme. Caesars Palace fit the bill, and turned out to be even better than we expected! We had a blast, and plan to go back. We booked our nonstop flight and hotel through Southwest Airlines Vacations. This was a convenient way to set up a first trip, but I probably would not do it again. We got a good price (and I found a promo code on the Las Vegas Talk board, which knocked an additional 10% off the price). But I could probably get just as good a deal by calling hotels and setting up flights online. What I didn\u2019t like about SW Vacations: 1. They issued us printed tickets. So, while ticketless passengers could get their boarding passes 24 hours in advance, we had to check in at the airport. This virtually guaranteed us being in \u201cC\u201d group. Yes, it was one short flight, and no airplane seat is going to be great\u2014but I didn\u2019t like not having the option to get an \u201cA\u201d boarding pass. And I hated standing in long check-in lines while e-ticket holders breezed past us to the self-serve kiosks. Southwest should either go entirely ticketless, or allow ticket holders to check in electronically. 2. Southwest\u2019s website stated that all rooms at Caesars Palace had coffeemakers. After I booked, I discovered from trip reports that all the coffeemakers were removed months ago. Now, I don\u2019t have a lot of quirks\u2014but I really need a cup of coffee in the morning before I go out. Room service coffee would have cost $8.00 plus $2.50 service fee plus tip. I ended up buying and packing a little coffeemaker. Not a huge inconvenience, but if Southwest had provided accurate information in advance, I might have chosen a different hotel. Caesars airport check-in was very convenient; we had our room key by the time our bags came up the carrousel. A cab from the airport to Caesars cost us just over $12. A shuttle would have been $5 each and probably would have stopped at other hotels. This hotel was great! We booked the basic Run-of-House room, the Deluxe. I was a little nervous after reading some reviews of this room category. If you want luxury, go for a more expensive room. But if you just want a comfortable, pleasant room for a good price, the Deluxe was perfectly fine. We were on the 7th floor of the Roman Tower, with a small view of the Strip. Our room was much bigger than a comparably-priced business class hotel room (Marriott, Sheraton, etc.). It had a chaise longue, coffee table, desk and two desk chairs, a wing chair, and a vanity stool in the bathroom. It was elegantly decorated, and clean except for some dust on the shelf above the clothes rod. Caesars supplied quality toiletries (no shower cap), a card-operated safe, and three towels daily. (Four would be better for two people.) CP\u2019s large swimming pools and hot tubs were beautiful. Thick towels were provided. There was a poolside caf\u00e9 that provided food, and servers constantly circulated with food and drink service. The fitness center was nice, but cost $25 per day or $65 for three days. Ouch. One day our room was not cleaned until 3:00 and the bed was not made, but the other days, service was prompt and complete. There was no snack vending, the soda machine on our floor and on the 6th floor did not work, and the bottles of water in the room cost $4 (good joke, Caesars). But other than that, we loved this property. It is elegant, glitzy, has tons of shops and restaurants, the casino has good ventilation, and you can\u2019t beat the location in the middle of the Strip! We visited numerous properties: Wynn, Venetian, TI, Mirage, Imperial Palace, Bally\u2019s, Paris, Bellagio, Monte Carlo, MGM, Luxor, NYNY, and Mandalay Bay. Caesars was a good starting point, and we ended up liking it the best. The only other properties I liked enough to stay at were Bellagio (more expensive) and Mandalay Bay (way far south).", "Date": "October 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Floyds Knobs, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Stay\u201d", "Author": "kmarsh99", "ReviewID": "UR4036670", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at Caesars on Labor Day weekend and had a great stay.

Check-in was a breeze and we paid $44 for the roundtrip shuttle for 4 of us. ($5.50 each) I definitely recommend the airport checkin. Upon arriving at the hotel I went to the Information desk and asked about an upgrade. They said for an additional $70 I could be put in the Augustus Tower. I refused and went to our room in the Roman Tower. It was fantastic. On the 11th floor with an obscured view of the strip. The Imperial Palace to the left and Paris could be seen to the right. In front of our window was another tower. Small TV in bathroom, big tub and separate walk in shower stall. Phone by toilet. Very nice. 2 mirrors and 2 sinks. Room had no bad odor and everything about the four days we stayed there was good. The one exception to that I will make is that we did not get maid service one day and had to call at 5pm to get fresh towels. Also, on second day some bottled water showed up in the bathroom by the tub with a tag that said they were $4 each if they were removed. When we checked out we were charged for them even though they were still there. I called the front desk and they quickly took it off of our bill. Caesar\u2019s is HUGE, the Forum Shops are HUGE. The Cypress Market place was a quick and easy way for me to get breakfast and bring it back to the room for my wife and kids. Planet Hollywood in the Forum Shops was awful.

The closest monorail station is across the street from Caesar\u2019s all the way through the Flamingo and out the back door of the hotel. I would only recommend the monorail if you are trying to get to a hotel on the East side of the strip. (Caesar\u2019s is on the West side of the strip) Otherwise take the strip trolley or get a cab out front of Caesar\u2019s. It is worth the extra money for a cab. DO NOT TAKE THE BUS! It took us 30 minutes to go from Circus Circus to Bellagio. Plus we were crowded into a standing room only bunch of stinky people. I thought we were going to be crushed.

We had to wear sandals the carpets we're so gross, the 2nd deluxe room was no better, tired, noisey and filthy. It wasnt until we changed to the Spa deluxe room that I appreciated Caesars palace. They have built a new tower but have forgotten to fix their original rooms, even the grime and grease on the elevator buttons we're not cleaned. On the upside, the casino itself is amazing! I suggest visiting the casino and staying somewhere else. I cant believe we chose Caesars when Bellagio was the same price for the same weekend. We've stayed at Mirage, Treasure Island and MGM.

First off, for those who have not been to Caesars Palace in several years, the renovation investment has been terrific. The casino's are brighter, the addition of the nightclub, Shaddow Bar, Mesa Grill, Bradley Ogden, 808 really help make the place a destination. Arrived at 11 am and was able to check in at 1 pm to the new Augustus Tower on opening day -- knowing that employees have been staying in the tower for the past 3 weeks \"breaking it in\". Upon arriving in the room, I called the bell desk for my 1 bag -- after 6-7 calls and 3 hours later, the bag arrived (they wanted me to stay in my room to wait for my bag). As it turned out, the \"older bellman who was slow so they would appreciate my patience\" signed out for my bag but left it in the cloak room. So, I missed 3 hours of either pool time or work-out time. Back to the new Tower: Room is large (>650 sq ft) with a contemporary feel -- with some Barbara Barry design influences. The tower is just off of the new Caesar's reception area -- away from the Casino floor so you feel you have \"escaped\" the madness a bit. The tower has a seperate walkway for the pool as well --again avoiding flip-flops vs. slot machine conflict. Frette-equivelant linens, down pillows, pillow-top bed, LCD TV's in main room and bath. Bathroom is large (double vanity, large spa tub, seperate shower, hidden toilet area. Right before leaving for dinner, I called housekeeping to request turndown service and was informed that \"since the tower is new, they don't have turndown service set-up yet\". So I requested that someone bring a new set of towels up and remove the used ones (since there are only 2 sets in each room) so a fresh towel would be available in the AM. Upon returning to the room late, that request was completed. Dining/Entertainment: Had dinner at BOA in the Caesar's Shops -- hip, trendy, with terrific service -- food very acceptable -- 2 appetizers, shared salad, two entrees, 1 dessert and 1 moderate priced bottle of wine was $250 for 2 -- on the pricier end, but no more that NY or LA. We went back to Shaddow Bar for a drink before heading to a 10:30 pm show -- very cool place -- we walked in just as the flair bartending show started with bartenders doing a rehersed synchronized juggling, tossing set with bottles, shakers, etc. The Shaddow go-go dancers make it a more \"adult\" bar, but since you only see their shaddow, it is very subtle and refined. Breakfast the next morning was at the new Coffee Shop -- Augustus Cafe. Breakfast for 2 was $30 (full breakfasts) and the only negative was that the gentleman who took our order then went on break and the \"hand off\" was not communicated too well -- 1 hour for our food, which arrived cold but was then replaced. Summary: Great new room, great entertainment, inconsistent/poor hotel service. I would stick with Bellagio or the Venetian if the rates were the same -- but give the Augstus Tower a try if it is the better rate.", "Date": "August 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201c5 Star dump\u201d", "Author": "I_Travel_Much", "ReviewID": "UR3741121", "Content": "I booked a stay at this infamous Vegas landmark 2 weeks ahead.

I arrived very excited on a Tuesday afternoon at the airport. As advised by the hotel staff I proceeded to the Airport check-in and waited in line for 15 minutes. No problem I thought to myself, just a minor delay on the way to bliss. The clerk at the airport did take my request for a room on a higher floor, but suggested a pricier room they had available. Oh well as long as I am on vacation I can pay a bit more. Unfortunately the room was not available and I received a \u201chold this\u201d piece of paper. Upon arriving at the hotel, the room was not yet available thus storing my luggage with the Bell Captain, I headed off to survey the Empire. The property is quite large and I did a good deal of walking before I was able to see the small city they call Caesars Palace. At 3:00 PM I returned to inquire about my room. To my surprise there were enormous lines of people bitching and moaning of how long they have been in line or how many hours they have been waiting for a room. No problem I told myself I\u2019ll keep an open mind, after all I have been in town for 4 hours now. My room must be ready and I can finally change and relax. Oh well no such luck, no room is available and \u201cwe don\u2019t know when you can have one\u201d. But what about my waiting in all these lines all the time? What did you expect, to just waltz in here and get a room any time you want? I thought that after 2 weeks notice and $300 / night I can expect some kind of service from a 5 star hotel. Eventually around 5PM I received a room and was able to change. The room was not bad, but a bit run down. I took a shower and went about my business the other 3 days of my stay.

Nothing special and older room that's a little tired. It's a place to lay your head nothing more, nothing less. However clean and neat with very good daily cleaning. We checked in @ airport and shaved 1+ hours off our time. I checked in while my girlfriend collected the luggage (on same level of airport). We politely asked for upgrade possibility and the check in girl politely mentioned a large price. Also mentioned no freebies unless \"Rated\". The place was about half capacity and we were a little surprised by that. Don't pay for a shuttle service! It's easier and quicker to fetch a cab for the same price. We called the shuttle service (which we already paid for) for pick-up and they we're very difficult and wouldn't arrive when we wanted. We ate the cost and grabbed a cab (painless and quick). Caesars is right in the middle of everything and easy walk to anywhere. Caesars best asset is the pools, very nice and relaxing, main pool busy if you want to see and be seen. The others quiet and casual. The pool staff is a little understaffed. Takes 30 paces and your at the bar to get your own drinks again quicker and easier. The gym is $25 a day per. Very pricey but nice. What we didn't realize until too late is you can buy a 5 day pass for > half the price. A well kept secret at our expense.

I would advise you to use the check in desk at the airport whilst you are waiting for your cases, as the wait can be a long one, and this will utimately save you time when you reach the hotel, where the queues are quite big. We were in the Roman Tower, and as the hotel is so huge it is easy to loose your way. The room was great, probably not as spectacular as I had hoped, having read such great reviews, none the less there were no complaints. One thing we found very odd was that the bathroom had no door, now the bathrooms are big and even have a TV, but not to have a door where the toilet is (it is round the corner from the shower cubicle so hidden away) we found this strange, and as I was with my husband it was OK for us, but I imagine if you were with a friend or new partner this could be a little uncomfortable. I missed being able to make coffee in my room in a morning, but the hotel want you out spending money so they aint going to provide stuff that keeps you in your room any longer than necessary. Also the room we were allocated had a connecting door to next door and the noise travelled through this door quite a bit, particulary when we had American neighbours who talked loudly at 5 am. The pool area is fantastic and they will provide however many towels you want, which is very generous. However be warned it was hotter than hot and there is very limited shade, unless you want to use one of the double four poster beds that have canopies (and look silly in my opinion!) or pay for a cabanna. We had to use natural shade provided by the foliage, again probably a hotel ploy to get you into the casino and spending your dollars. The hotel does take your breath away and the shops are the best on the strip. We ate many meals in the hotel and we loved best the restaurant Boa which is on the top floor in the forum, couldn't fault a thing, great steaks, and fab martinis, wonderful setting with a balcony to view the strip if this is your thing, it does have cool air blowing out so that you don't get too hot. Book your tables as the queues and waiting involved for tables does get lengthy particularly about 8pm onwards, I find this frustrating as often I don't know what I want until I have a look around. The Empress chinese restaurant is fab also, you can't see this from the Casino you have to get a lift to it, but once there it is a beautiful place and ultra trendy. Be warned if you book a table and don't show up, the hotel will charge your credit card with $50 for the no show. The hotel has quite a few talking statues that come to \"life\" on the hour, Bachus and Neptune, both worth watching. The pool side snacks were good value and huge, but not that great in taste and service for drinks very slow, to be fair they waitresses didn't have an easy job to serve loads of people in 110 degree heat. We did venture out at night, but the temperature was so intense that you couldn't wait to get into a hotel, it honestly felt like someone had a hairdryer on top speed blowing in your face. We went to the Imperial Palace to see Legends in Concert which are allegedly lookalikies, well not as the case may be....our advice, give it a miss, go to see one of the more classier shows on the strip, more money but better spent. Imperial Palace is so run down, and the show hasn't had any money spent on it, costumes were tatty and falling to pieces, the dancers were unprofessional and kept laughing and giggling with each other...we laughed more at the acts rather than with them. I probably sound harsh here, and in their defence some of the acts did have very good soundalike voices, in particular The Coasters and Elvis. I believe the show changes from time to time, presumably so you will go back and see a different show during your stay (yeah right!) Must see's are, Wynn's resort, fabulous new hotel, Views by night from the Stratosphere, and Paris hotel. Obviously the Grand Canyon by helicopter, and a good classy show. Things to give a miss, Imperial Palace shows, Freemont Street in Downtown Vegas there are laser shows that last 5 mins on the hour, they are good, but not worth the trip in a taxi, or the wait for the hour to start, loads of dodgy looking people hanging around the area.

The 3 oldest original towers are the Roman, Forum, and Centurion towers. Although all three have been renovated, the Centurion is easily the worst of the three. My travel is usually business, which includes getting a room at the conference rate. This typically results in a room in Centurion tower (unless you are fortunate enough that none are available), which is consitently below average. My last stay was June 22-24 '05, and the carpets in my room were stained, the impractical shower stall has no where to put you shampoo, conditioner except on the floor of the stall, and the separate standard 60\" tub does not invite a soaking session (can't imagine someone soaking in the same small type tub you have at home). It may be coincidence but I've noticed that front desk and room service are slower in this tower! Forum and Roman towers are somewhat better. The palace tower is outstanding, and the Agustus tower, which opens in August '05, promises to be exceptional. Aside from the \"crap shoot\" of which Tower you wind up in, this truly is the quintesential Las Vegas Experience. Great location, Great casino, Exceptional shopping in the forum shoppes has to be the best on the strip, by far. Hotel pool is truly Roman picturesque.

But I was told by one of the workmen I encountered in the hall, that they were busy putting doors in (turns out most women did not like the curtain arrangement). Otherwise the bathroom was handsome with marble tub and counter, plenty of towels, and nice toiletries. Despite the renovations, Caesars has a somewhat hard, brassy edge one associates with the old Las Vegas. I guess I would have been happy enough at Caesars had I not gone across the street to take a peek at the Bellagio, which I found much prettier and softer. The pool areas at Caesars are fabulous--you are completely shielded from the noise and bustle of the street and surrounded by statues and greenery. Plus, there are several pools, which help disperse the crowd and a couple of hot tubs tucked into cozy nooks. Though Caesars is located smack in the middle of everything, be prepared to walk. The hotel is set well back off the strip which means a bit of a walk to get there -- but then Vegas is all about walking. Forum shops are nice, but again, competition from the shopping arenas at Paris and the Venetian is stiff. When we were there, Caesars was in the middle of adding even more shopping to the Forum, so you know they have an eye on their competitors. Our room was clean but had none of the added amenities you get in hotels such as the Westin (home of the heavenly bed), or other luxury hotels, and most \"extras\" are just that, extra.

The two of us arrived at 11:30pm on Thursday night. We had no problem with check-in, and we were upgraded to a \"jacuzzi tub\" suite, although the room was still in the Forum Tower (I believe that is the oldest tower). Also, it was on a \"smoking-optional\" floor (when did they stop calling it a smoking floor?), but the gentlemen at the reception desk assured us that housekeeping had some sort of system to air out a room, and if we found our room to not smell fresh enough, someone would be up within ten minutes to take care of everything. We arrived at our room, and to our relief, it did not smell like smoke. The furnishings in the room are comfortable, but not fancy or extravagant in any way. The bathroom was huge, big enough for four people to get ready in at night! If you are in the forum tower, I would ask for a room at the very end of the tower closest to the Strip. We had an amazing view of the Strip from our room, but I think if you were just a few rooms away from us, you would only see the other Caesars Towers. Because we arrived so late, our dining options were limited, and we decided to check out the Cafe Lago restaurant. I know you shouldn't expect too much from a 24-hour casino restaurant, but we really didn't enjoy our meal. I wouldn't recommend going--I have had late-night dinners at Bellagio's 24-hour restaurant, and the food there was MUCH better, not to mention a nicer atmosphere! Our friends arrived the next day. They had reservations for the Palace Tower (the newly renovated tower), which they had paid for in advance. When they tried to check in (at about 2:00 in the afternoon) they were told that due to something that came up that morning, they did not have any available rooms because they were renovating. They offered to put our friends up at the Flamingo for free. Our friends said no way, the Flamingo is not comparable to a room in the Palace Tower. Eventually our friends wore them down, I guess, because a room was miraculously available in the Palace Tower. Lesson learned: stick to your guns. From what we could hear going on around us, we suspected that many people were having plans changed because Caesars overbooked that weekend. Just be prepared if you come on a weekend! Friday we stuck by the pool, which was great! It's a great set up there. The food at the pool is pretty decent, but drink service can be a little slow. We ate at Mesa Grill Friday evening--it was outstanding! I highly recommend that restaurant for a meal. Saturday night we ate at Mon Ami Gabi at Paris, which was also great--and you can't beat the patio view of the Bellagio fountains. For our breakfasts, we walked over to Paris and got things at the little cafes. The lines seemed to move quickly there. This was my second trip to Vegas. My first trip I stayed at Bellagio, which I am afraid has spoiled me for life. Anyway, if you can get a deal, I would stay at Caesars. It's not as high-brow or elegant as some other places, but it still provided decent service and a clean, comfortable room. The location is wonderful. The pool is great. It has a young, fun, vibe. If, however, you are used to excellent hotels and accommodations, I would head to Bellagio.

What a great time. The hotel was fabulous. Very well kept and lots of real character unlike the more sterile \"Disney\" feeling we found at others like Bellagio, Venetian, Paris, and Aladdin. The pool was wonderful. There are 4 pools and 2 hot tubs. All the pools are different in atmosphere so you should be able to find something that suits your mood. One pool allows European Sunbathing (topless) and is secluded by vegetation. No children allowed and it has a quiet tasteful adult atmosphere. All pools have waitress service for food and drink, but you may have trouble finding one at times as they seem to be short staffed in this one area. (This being the most critical reason why my wife gave this an \"above average\" rating as otherwise I think we would have gone with \"excellent\" ... she just confirmed that I'm correct on this assumption .. and hit me telling me to stop adding this sidebar) But otherwise the pools were wonderful and we did spend many hours there. We had the basic room. It unfortunately didn't have much of a view being on the 6th floor and looking at another building, but since we wanted to check in early we could not be too choosy. However we were not there for the view from the hotel room so this was not an issue. Aside from this the room was clean and quiet. The bathroom was nice with seperate shower and tub with marble floors. One odd thing was that there is no bathroom door. Not even for the toilet. Given that we have only been married 10 years (together for 14) we have not yet reached the point in our relationship where we can be that open with each other as to not have a door for the toilet. This lead to a rule on one staying in the bedroom area while said toilet was in use! The bathroom is completely seperated and has a doorway. Just no door. The shopping was good. There was a mix of stores that can be found in most malls (Bath and Body, Victoria's Secret, GAP, etc) as well as many very up scale stores. Fashion Show Mall is a short walk north on the strip if you're looking for more shopping. The casino was nice, but we didn't gamble even a penny. We went to relax and see the shows in Vegas. But it was a nice casino. The food was fabulous. Caesars probably has the best selection of eating establishments and although not cheap the food is excellent.

I liked the little sitting area with a chair and a chaise lounge, which was very comfortable. I appreciated the in-room safe. The bathroom had been renovated, looked very new. It was really terrific, with plenty of towels, two sinks (one was a little vanity with a magnetized mirror and a stool), and a small TV to watch the news while you shave, brush your teeth, etc. The whirlpool was steps from the bed, and it was a bathtub, not round, so a bit smaller than one might expect.

Seeing as it was just for one extra night, we decided to give Caesar's a try. It was a bit pricier than we were paying at the Flamingo, but we managed to get a Spa Package for $150/night, which included two spa admissions and complementary champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries delivered to your room that evening.(we would have paid $260 to extend our stay at the Flamingo, compared to the $65/night rate we had just paid... it was spring break) We got a room in the Roman Tower overlooking the pool area. Check-in was a breeze, even though it was busy. The room itself was quite nice, but pretty standard as far as LV goes. (It is funny, but you come to expect more from a hotel room in LV.) The bathroom had been recently renovated and was very nice in sparkling white with silver fixtures; even had a small screen TV in the make-up/sink area. The room was quiet and I had a great sleep after a long night in the casino. In the morning, we decided to get some use out of the Spa passes. I booked a short massage (extra cost), which was fantastic, and then luxuriated in the sauna, steam and whirlpool area. I felt very well taken care of. I think I will be taking advantage of Hotel Spa areas more often. My stay at Caesar's was great, even if for one night.

The wedding service and cordinators were great but our stay at Caesar's was very disappointing and terrible. We arrived at the hotel on Sunday February 20th, 2005. We arrived at the valet area around 12:30 p.m., the valet attendants were a little friendly, but could have been better. When we went to check-in we only waited for about 10 mins. We thought that our suite would not be ready until 3 or so. The front desk person said that there was not a room ready, and that it would not be ready until at least 5p.m. I told him that check-in time is 3, and that I needed it to be ready by 4. We were scheduled to have our wedding party, up to our suite at 4. He said o.k. and gave me a number to call back in a little while to see if the room was ready. That was fine, we had planned to go have lunch with our family and friends at the Rio at 1:00pm. Well as we were leaving I sat down for a few minutes, because I had just drove 7 hours to get to Las Vegas. The front desk gentleman (Adam) came to find us, he said that they had a room ready, and we could check-in and go look at it. He said that we could have the bell-men take up our belongings while we were gone at lunch. We thought everything would be fine. Well we got our room keys, and went up to suite 482 in the Roman Tower. When we steped in, lets say that it was not pleasant. It had 2 nice marble steps to go in to the roon, and a huge marble floor once you stepped in. After that the first thing we saw, was a huge stain in the carpet, that looked almost the color of I don't know what. I thought, well maybe they can cover it with a rug. Then there was a huge round table, that was proble nice when they first got it, as you got closer it had a lot of big gashes in it. A lot of the lights and lamps did not work, and there was actually broken glass from a light bulb on a table, not to mention the broke off bulbs that were still in some of the lamps. When you walked to the right where the bar was, the marble bar was very dirty, and stained. My husband went in to the master bathroom, he went to turn on the water, and the fixture came off. Well my friend that was with us called down to the front desk and talked to Adam. He was quick to help, and still very nice. Well by this point we had to call our families and friends to tell them that we would not make it to lunch, and we still had not ate that day. Adam took us to the same suite on the 5th floor # 582 to give it a look. My husband and our two friends looked it over, to make sure non of the other problems were in this suite. It was good, so we said o.k. They brought our luggage and things up, and then we left to get some lunch, finally around 2:30p.m. So, we had already delt with the hotel for 2 hours. We called our wedding party and said 4o'clock was still a go in the suite. So everyone got there while I went to pick up my sister/maid-of-honor. When we got back I had to run to the restroom, when I came out, I saw my daughter open a cabinet under the sink, then she began to scream histarically. Then she yelled\" ROACH\", I thought I was hearing things, and my best-friend, the god-father of my children began to chase it , and kill it. How bad is that? My friend who had already delt with the hotel people, called down to the front desk again. Whoever answered was very rude, and said that they would send someone right up. After 25 minutes, my sister took the napkin that had the roach in it to the front desk, and asked them what they would like her to do with it? The lady looked at her crazy, and grabbed it, and tossed it in the trash. Then offered a $50.00 food and beverage credit, that I already had. She continued asking my sister and friend what they wanted her to do about it, while I and the rest of our wedding party waited for the person they were sending up. When she got there, she looked quickly, and briefly, and then said I do not see anything. One of my bridesmaids asked her to check again, she said o.k., o.k. meha, I look again, very rudely. My sister and friend went to check out suite 1082, same tower. It was o.k., but I had to go down and get the new keys. So, my husband, sister, best-friend, best-man, and about 6 other friends went down to talk to a manager. Well after we asked for a manager it took about 30-40 mins before she came, and the front desk peoole kept saying, oh, they do this to us all the time. They don't worry about us or the customer waiting. Well by the time she can, I very very emotionally drained and upset. My friend had to talk to her, because I was so upset, I could not talk. My friend proseeded to tell her what we had been through all day, and that I was mordified by what I went through, and how bad it was for roaches to be in my room, and for all of our wedding party to witness it. She kept asking, what do you want me to do? Then my friend said to her, instead of asking me what I want you to do, why don't you tell me waht you are gonig to do to make it better? I guess she finally remembered how to do her job, and what she was there for, and finally offered to move us, and comp us for our last night, that we were going to have to move to a smaller room for. So, in total we spent about 7 hours dealing with our room, and all of our plans were ruined. My whole wedding party, were yelling at eachother, and upset with me. All beacause Caesar's Palace put us behind schedule. I almost did not get my marriage license in time. When I woke up in the morning, I looked like a mess, because I had been crying so much, thank god, my wedding did not start until 4:00p.m. Oh, by the way, they did not refund the rest of my cash deposit either. I put down $200.00 and only used about $90.00 of it, so they still owe me $110.00 for my deposit. To sum it all up. I do recommend the wedding chapel, it was beautiful, unfortunalty my wedding cordinator did not work that day. As for the hotel, I give it a F-, a straight failure. I forgot to mention that the valet yelled at my friend right after she picked up my car from then, even after she tipped them quite generouslly. So, my advise is go the the New York New York , MGM, Mirage, Luxor, even Imperial Palace if you want good sevice, because Caesar's is truely not a Palace fit for anyone.", "Date": "February 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "So.

From our window we could see extension cords, HVAC units, other balconies, and not much else, even after \"upgrading\". From our toilet, we could see everything since there is no door.... My wife and I have stayed at 11 different Vegas strip hotels, only staying one time at the same hotel (Mirage). Our 13th (unlucky) trip was to Caesars this January. Believe me, we have something to base our review on! Caesars Palace is a wonderful, large, somewhat confusing property. The casino skews to the higher roller, but has plenty of quarter machines. You would have a tough time finding any $5 tables, and probably no seats at the $10 tables, but I didn't notice any crowding at the $5000 minimum tables. The restaurants are numerous, particularly if you count the many quality places in the Forum Shops, which is attached. We ate at two, the PALM and TERRAZZA, and were very satisfied at both. Prices tend to be steeper for the quality than we have found elsewhere, but perhaps the \"Caesars\" name can explain that premuim. Check In was efficient. However, our room was a disaster. The room we were originally given looked out on a roof, with a distant view of more roofs, a partial view of some other room balconies, and a lot of pipes, a ladder, one bright orange extension cord, and, if you got down on the floor and peeked up through the very top of the window, you could see a sliver of the sky (I think). We, being incredibly fussy people, for the very first time in our lives, went back down and requested a better room. We were paying about $190 per night. Maybe at Caesars that is \"chump change\", and we have certainly paid more (and a lot less) for a room, but what they offered was a joke. Unfortunately, the room on the 10th floor we were \"upgraded\" to was a laugher as well. The \"partial strip view\" looked through a tunnel of guest rooms, where we could see the Flamingo sign, a few of the Flamingo rooms, and a peek of the mountains behind. Mostly we just looked across at more rooms that had even worse views that we had (they had to look at me, the poor slobs), and a higher up view of the roof. Now I have used TRIP ADVISOR before, and I am NOT one of those gloomy negative guys that blow every little thing out of proportion. There are a LOT of great things about Caesars. But as I looked at this property, some things just became obvious to me. First, most of the mega-resorts on the strip were built complete, and were designed to take the most advantage possible of the views available in as many rooms as possible. Caesars, being the grand-daddy of the mega-resorts, has had to continually add construction to keep up. This new construction appears to have surrounded the old construction, but they still have many, many (thousands?) rooms in the \"old\" towers, and these rooms, which probably used to have great views, now have absolutely horrid views of the wonderful \"new\" towers (and Celine's ampitheatre and the new Forum shops, etc. etc.). It also appears that many of the \"new\" non-strip facing rooms have poor views, unless you are on a floor high enough to look over the old towers. Good luck getting one of the rooms in the new towers facing the strip, I am sure they are the most primo and hard to get rooms, unless you're a \"whale\" (huge gambler). So if you are a \"view\" person, which we are, you are taking a big risk booking at Caesars. Obviously there are some rooms at Caesars with great views, but there are A LOT more rooms at Caesars that have crappy views than there are at most of the other mega-resorts. Make no mistake, this is a first-class property. Anybody who says its a dump is pyscho. I am fairly certain that our room had to be toward the lower end, but everything in it was clean, well decorated, comfortable, just what you'd expect from a high dollar resort. But what are they thinking? Our bathroom was nice, with a double sink vanity area, marble floors, a large garden tub and seperate glass shower area. But the toilet was next to the shower, in view of the vanity area AND THE FRONT DOOR and HALL, and there is no door, no way to close off the area. If you are in the room alone, no problem, but my wife and I were with several other people at times, and not having any ability for privacy was definitely a nuisance. In our room and the other 3 rooms I saw when I was there, there were no doors. Another couple we were with, while they did not have a door either, saw some rooms being made up that DID have bathroom doors. So if this is important to you, you had better check this too. In nothing I saw on Caesars website, on any travel website, or in the numerous travel guidebooks I own is this mentioned, which was surprising to me. The last thing my wife wants to see while she is doing her hair is me sitting on the toilet. (In fact I'm sure it's the last thing ANY sane person wants to see...) Maintenance service was poor as well. The first night, our A/C started some kind of vibrating hum that sounded like a cross between someone playing the same note on a bass guitar and a sick ghost. Fortunately it was not hot, so we just shut it off, and called in the morning. \"Engineering\" said they'd send someone up. We lived our lives that day, came back, and once again it woke us up. We shut it off again, called the next morning, and that day we received a nice note asking us to call the engineering department supervisor. We did that and he acted like he had no clue what we wanted, but promised he'd have someone right up to fix it. We wrote a note trying to explain what was happening, which we left on the thermostat (where they had put their note). Third night, same thing. We just gave up after that. Speaking of guidebooks, I was surprised at how high Caesars was generally rated for rooms. They cannot possibly take into account the average view. Caesars simply cannot compete with the other hotels, such as Mirage, Treasure Island, Mandalay Bay, etc. for quality of average room view. The cheapest place we have ever stayed in Vegas was the Boardwalk next to Monte Carlo, and the views out our window just blew Caesars away. The room was not as nice, but it was more than adequate (it had doors on the bathroom), and for much less than half the price, it was just better than Caesars (although the Boardwalk facility doesn't hold a candle to Caesars or any of the other mega-resorts). One of the people we went with on this trip was a \"big-player\" who was fully comped by Caesars with a free room, all their meals, etc. Yet his view was poor as well. This is a guy who Caesars knows, he's constantly offered freebies from Caesars and Harrahs, and he STILL got a nasty view. That is another reason I believe that Caesars just doesn't HAVE that many rooms with good views. This guy is rated on Blackjack at over $150 per hand and had 40+ hours on the table at Caesars in the 3 days he was with us. Of course, maybe at Caesars that is a \"low-roller\". I am working on him to take his business to Harrahs or another place, I feel fairly sure that he'll get treated better. Maybe you need to be one of those $5000+ per hand players (that I never saw) to get the good rooms at Caesars. I will typically bring anywhere from $5000 - $15000, but I think I must be too conservative to ever really get the \"good\" comp deals (although I do get an awful lot of mail from Harrahs/Rio). I guess I am telling you that if you think your \"play\" is going to get you a good room, be sure of that before you go. My other buddy was rated at $47 per hand for around 12 hours of play (plus a lot of video stuff), and they offered to knock $9 (nine dollars) off his room price, which they didn't even do when he checked his bill. So know what you are going to get before you go. Other places might give you a lot better deal for the same level of play than Caesars seems willing to do, I don't know. So in conclusion, if you want to stay in a world-famous, world-class resort, and are not concerned with a view, or privacy on the toilet, or responsive service for maintenance issues, Caesars is your place. The facilities in the casino are top notch. The decor and theming are fun and exciting. The employees are generally friendly and helpful, except when improving your room view. But perhaps they can't help that since they just don't have a lot of rooms with good views. The restaurants we ate in provided good service and good food, at a slight over charge, but generally were excellent. Their casino took our money, but they all are very good at that. Definitely a higher-roller casino, I felt more comfortable at Mirage or across the street (Barbary Coast, Flamingo, O'sheas, Harrahs, etc.). Overall, however, we were extremely disappointed, staying at Caesars was not at all what we had hoped. I am fairly certain we will be staying where we can have a better view next year. If you are going to Caesars, be really clear with them what your expectations are, and be sure that they can accomodate you. If they can't, spend your money in one of the many other mega-resorts. We now have 12 of them \"under our belts\", and Caesars was the most disapointing for us.", "Date": "February 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly surprised\u201d", "Author": "smorela", "ReviewID": "UR3165772", "Content": "We stayed Jan 4-7, 2005 and stayed in the Palace Tower. Nice room, but nothing spectacular. We've been to Las Vegas before and stayed at the MGM, Mandalay Bay, and The Lexor but this time chose Caesars Palace as this was where my husband would be attending a conference. While he went to the conference, I walked and walked; casino floor, forum shops, etc. One thing that struck me odd is that none of the staff smiled. Even when I made eye contact and smiled. One time I went to the consig. desk for assistance booking a bus tour to the Hoover Dam, and felt like I was more like a nusiance to them than a guest. That certainly didn't make me feel like a valued customer. I enjoyed the layout of the casino and figured out the exits/entrances so I could walk the strip with ease, too. Really enjoyed the central location. There was construction going on but I didn't even know it until I got on the bus to head to the Hoover Dam. It took forever to get out of that back drive and through the garage. When I got back I really wanted to take a nap, but housekeeping hadn't arrived and I didn't want to be woken in the middle of sleep, so watched some TV. By 4 pm they still hadn't come, so I wandered the halllway till I found a cart, then stood outside the open door till I caught the housekeepers attention to let her know we needed assistance. We had looked online for Celine Dion tickets before we arrived, and they started around $200 so we decided to skip that; but when we were there a friend said she got tickets under $100 at the box office, so we checked into it and did the same. The show was AMAZING. The only drawback is the drink holders don't hold cups well. The person seating guests kept saying, like a mantra, \"hold on to your drinks, they don't sit well in the holder\". Well, the guy next to me didn't speak english, and was a bit tipsy already, and spilt his drink right away and splashed some on me. You'd think when they built the place they would have figured out the small details, or at least once the problem was discovered, changed the shape of the glasses the beverages are served in. I loved the food I ate at Caesars, and loved the addition to the Forum shops since our last visit to Las Vegas.

Our two kids ran into the room and jumped on the beds screaming \"we're rich, we're rich!!! Unfortunately, I did not begin to feel better. Caesars had a medical service where you could call and speak to a doctor and get medical advice. In the end, the doctor advised me to go to a hospital emergency room. Guest services sent 2 security people upto the room to escort me downstairs in a wheelchair. They then provided me with a free car ride to the hospital. Upon arrival at the hospital, the driver gave me a card with a number to call when I needed a ride to come back to the hotel!

Like most Strip hotels, Caesar's Palace is mammoth, and sprawls every which way. It can be a hike to get to parking, shopping, and the like, just because the place is so large, but from what we saw, that's true of most of the hotels in that area. One minor disappointment was Caesar's buffet, which is served in Cafe Lago. It's okay, everything tasted fine, but the assortment of options was fairly average. However, there are several fine restaurants in the Forum Shops area, so there's no need to stick with the heart of the hotel for food options. Another small, tiny quibble was the casino. Rather than stretching and sprawling around into the shops, I would have preferred for it to be more localized. They also didn't seem to have a poker room, like the Bellagio and some of the other casinos, but perhaps I missed it. However, I'm not much of a gambler, so the only reason for it coming up on the radar was that it made navigating that space to get to parking and such something of a nuisance.

In terms of what was good to see & do in Vegas I'd recommend hanging out in the Fontana Bar at Bellagio to get a great view of the Dancing Fountains which seem to get better every year. A couple of friends went on the terrifying X-Scream ride at the Stratosphere but it was such a chore getting up there (the queue to go through security took almost an hour) that any enjoyment was short-lived. Went on a fantastic helicoper trip to Grand Canyon booked through Heli USA, organised through an agent situated between Bellagio & Monte Carlo. $289.00 got us a ride (including pick-up from the hotel) to the Canyon where we descended & landed at a working Cowboy Ranch. After a breakfast we were given the option to ride horses around a trail & then we were flown back via a fly-over the Strip. Whole trip took about 3 hours & was the highlight of the holiday apart from a trip to Club Paradise which is another story...!", "Date": "December 7, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "E.London UK", "Title": "\u201cCan't see the problems myself\u201d", "Author": "tlj", "ReviewID": "UR2868819", "Content": "2nd trip to vegas, 1st in Caesars.

My husband , my kids and I have been to Las Vegas 3 times before, but always stayed at the MGM so we decided to try Ceasars Palace. It was horrible. First, they have no entertainment at all for the kids. We felt horrible because my brother, his wife and their two kids also went. They have no Arcades, they have no place for the kids to hang out, so that the parents can play at the Casino. We had to reserve two rooms because they don't allows 5 people in a room so I asked for them connecting and my brother's room on the same floor. We get there and we have nothing, so they gave us a Penthouse Suite, big deal! They kept on mentioning that they had given us suites like if we cared, we just wanted our rooms after a five hour trip and be able to get unpacked. A suite with 2 bathrooms is great, but one bed doesn't really do much for a family of four and another family of five separated. 1 bed for my brother's family of four and two rooms for me. We couldn't unpack because the next day we had to get moved to another room. I got my rooms across from each other and of course my brother on another floor. Which he had to wait for his room because it wasn't ready. The pool was closed at 5:00. so that was another thing the kids couldn't do at night. We tried hanging out and just sitting in their lounge chairs and we got thrown out. The Restaurants were always full and extremely expensive. They have everything set up for people that are able to afford those prices (rich people), but don't they realize that rich people also have kids. The towels were hard, the pillows were too soft, the bathrooms need repair, the grout on them is all cracked and whenever you open the water faucet on the sinks the water goes all over the counter top because they were installed too far back.. It was a horrible vacation. We had better times at the New York New York, Excalibur and Mandalay Bay because they had things for the kids to do and better restaurants. I will never stay at Ceasars Palace again and whoever asks me I will thell them that it's not worth it. P.S. we had to pay a full day on a room since our flight left at 11:00 p.m. (you would think they wouldn't charge us since they gave us so many inconveniences) I kept one room and checked out the other and when we went to get in our room after being out the whole day the keys didn't work so we had to call security to come open the room for you. Also, you put the Do NOt DISTURB sign up and the maids take them off and go in your room anyways. So many other things happened but I just can't remember all of them.

We had traveled from Baltimore to visit Arizona and our Las Vegas night was at the end of our trip. I can't describe the disappointment we felt when we arrived at the reservation desk and were told that those who were only staying for one night were being shuffled to another hotel since they were overbooked. I could not believe this could be true. I started to cry while others who were checking in for more than one night were cheerfully given their room keys. The manager was called to make her apologies, but it was more than obvious this was a very standard procedure at Caesars. They don't need to be kind or care about how disappointed you are since they have a booming business without providing true hospitaliity. The manager did offer to have us back at a later time and pay for our room ~ did she really think that would make everything alright? I had read Trip Advisor commentaries about this very thing happening never dreaming in a million years it would happen to us. I would really think twice about booking at Caesars. Yes, it is a big name and it has been on the strip forever, but if you read the Trip Advisor commentaries about this hotel or the comments in the Fodors or Frommers Las Vegas books, you will read about all the elaborate facilities, but rarely a good word about their service. On a positive note, we were moved to the Westin Hotel off the strip near Balley's. It was absolutely wonderful. Management greeted you while you were in line at the front desk and you were actually made to feel welcome. Our room was excellent and the beds are unnbelievable with pillow top mattresses and heavenly sheets and linens. p.s. Have dinner at Lowrey's Prime Rib Restaurant. There are only 4 in the US.

I do like airport check-in and didn't expect an upgrade or extras, so we were doing good so far. The room was even a nice size (bathroom, too..seperate tub and shower), but that was were it ended. No mini-bar. You had to pay to use the safe (like I hadn't given them enough of my money already). Small closet, and only three drawers (my closet wasn't in the bathroom, so I must have been in a different tower than the other reviewer). But, my bathroom didn't have a door. Nice! Didn't want to hear or see that (our friends room even had solid mirror on the back wall of their bathroom so if you accidently happened by while someone was in there...you saw everything (you could see the shower, the tub and the toilet by looking in that mirror). There was no counter space in the bathroom yet two sinks. No need for that at all. I would have liked to have been able to put my vanity stuff out, but had to dump it all in the second sink. Very odd layout. Must have been done by a man who doesn't need 16 things to get ready. The worst part was that we had only two towels, two washclothes and two hand towels when we first go there. Not a problem until the housekeeping department didn't replace them when they cleaned the room. Of course I didn't notice any of this until I was in the shower. My husband and I had to share a hand towel to dry off for the night. No wash cloth to wash my face. Not good. Called immediately after getting out of the shower for towels and they didn't come (apparently this is a regular occurance since the other reviewer noted the same thing). Finally they brought us 100 after our second irate call. Someone told me it was because I didn't leave a tip. But they cleaned the room immaculately. And it was our first night. I don't tip until I know my team is good enough to deserve one (i.e. the second night). Other hotels I've stayed at in Vegas clean the room and have turn down service to insure you have enough towels (this is a two shower a day town with the all the sweaty walking during the day and smokey environments at night...apparently the Caesars isn't aware of that). I've even stayed at other Park Place (now Caesars Entertainment) Hotels and they did a much better job. You would think they would have similar procedures. Other problems (one small breakfast restaurant for all those rooms...come on, do they not want your business). They forced us to eat elsewhere. The layout is horrible. Very choppy and confusing. Bally's/Paris (another CE property combo) is layed out so well, it was surprising. I'm sure it's only going to get worse with the new Forum extension and the new hotel tower. Then the pool. Though beautiful, we were turned away because it was full! OK, our payment included use of the pool but we couldn't use it. Not good. There was plenty of room, they were just out of chairs. We lied and said our party was already out there and they let us through (just use that line if you get stuck...tell them your party is out there and they have a pass for you...it worked for us). Apparently this happens all the time during peak times. Not good. Now they are building another tower. I'm sure the food and pool problems will only get better. Anyway. Stay somewhere else! This is the intersection to stay in, so I would choose Bally's/Paris. Bellagio is overrated. Not nice enough for the premium you have to pay. Not as interesting as Caesars and Paris. Plus Bally's and Paris are very easy to navigate (one main walkway connects the two). Stay at Bally's (it's cheaper and has bigger rooms that were renovated not that long ago) but eat/entertain at Paris. The Paris rooms are nicer overall, but you get a better deal at Bally's. And if the Paris lines are too long which I have never experienced but might happen (they have a buffet and a seperate sit down restaurant for breakfast and a seperate pastry area), just go to the Bally's breakfast restaurant. That's my two cents. Hope it helps. P.S. Not one person we told about our towel problems and other issues cared or apologized. That was two calls to the operator who was told both times. Two transfers to the head of housekeeping who was told. The Bellman who asked how our stay was and the Check out cleark who asked how our stay was. Not one of them said I'm sorry about that. The later just handed us a comment card. They really cared, can't you tell. They just want your money folks. We thought for sure that they might issue us a small credit on the room or something.

From the ornate stone fountains to the sky-colored ceiling which changes with the progression of the day; from the faux Roman outside pools to the haggard old waitresses in skimpy Roman mini-skirts; from the cigarette puffing tourists throwing their holiday money on the gaming tables to the black stretch limos dispensing the serious players: it's breathtakingly awful, but it's SO well done.

The food is excellent when you get there. As in all the Las Vegas casinos, the slot machines (2,000 of them in Caesar's) are ultimately a sad sight: hordes of women in their 50s and 60s dolled up in their Sunday best clothes hitting the Max Bet button again and again until, after a few glimmers of false hope in the form of minor paybacks, the meter runs out. That elusive $9,000,000 progessive jackpot remains, well, elusive. On the up side, those Roman pools I mentioned are huge and spotlessly clean, and there's no shortage of sunbeds around them.
