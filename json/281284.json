The hotel sprawls out over a very large property. It is designed to feel like a small town. There are a couple of very good restaurants, a general store, postal services, etc. The hotel has a very nice pool and hot tub, as well as various other amenities that we didn't use. The main feature, was the room itself however. It consisted of a small cottage that was very luxuriously appointed, and a walled-in backyard area that contained an outdoor bathtub for two, chaise lounges, and some other amenities.

We had already traveled to the Maldives for our official, much longer honeymoon, but because we had to be in the Bay Area anyway for my husband's work, we decided to make a fun trip out of it. When confirming our reservation, the reservationist on the phone from the Carneros Inn made a special notation that we were celebrating our recent marriage. Only because she had made our half-work/half-fun trip into a honeymoon trip, we anticipated something special from the Carneros. Mind you, this is our fourth trip to the Carneros, so as repeat guests, we expect the typical bottle of wine and cheese plate provided upon check-in. We were disappointed to find out that there were no special \"perks\" provided to honeymooning couples. We did receive a bottle of chardonnay and the cheese plate, as well as the general manager's note. The Carneros was noticeably less full this time than our previous visits (all during summer/crush season). It seemed to us that all guests were localized around only a few clusters of cottages. We were able to get an extra hour before check out on our final morning; check out is normally at 12 noon. To receive late check out, call the front desk around 8am on the morning of your last day. Boon Fly breakfasts and lunches were fantastic and consistently delicious, as always. Room service dinner took exactly the amount of time we were told (about 35-45 minutes). The quality of the food served through cottage dining is decidedly inferior to the hilltop dining room and Boon Fly, so we recommend going out for dinner unless you absolutely cannot make it out. I'm at a loss for words to describe the ribeye steak I ordered, and my husband's bolognese -- while tastier than mine -- was just okay. Friends who have also stayed at the Carneros have told me breakfast room service is the way to go if you want the baker's dozen donuts (perfection!) but want to lounge in your private patio. We visited Plumpjack Winery for a tasting during this trip and were told our tastings would be free as part of our stay at the Carneros. We were also told tastings are free at Cade Winery for guests of the Carneros. The Plumpjack wines were surprising and delicious -- go! This is still our go-to hotel in Napa. I'm sure we will indulge in many more visits to the Carneros in the long run, but I am curious about staying in Yountville, particularly Bardessono. The Carneros Inn is much more lively and comfortable in the warmer months, as expected, but it's luxurious and charming any time of year.

Deserving of its lofty rating, but I don't think it is QUITE the ideal place or the best option if searching widely in Napa. First, the positives. The service is quite good, the whole reception & check-in process sets the right tone right at the start, pure luxury. The rooms are also excellent in size & appointments. Fireplace, outdoor shower, killer bathroom, etc. Can't really complain. The issues I would take are these. The decor style of the place is a bit off-putting to me. Its not \"old world luxury\" nor is it \"rustic\" or even remotely \"warm\". Its more like \"21st century shed\" style. Its a sort of minimalist, clean, probably very eco-friendly style, for it leaves me a bit cold when I compare it to other places in this area that ooze character & warmth. This also extends to the pool area which, while very nice, also has a touch of \"sterility\" and \"just built\" vibe to it. This may not be a negative for everyone, but for the price I like to feel like there's a bit of history behind things or luxury materials. My other concern is that this is a combination hotel & vacation ownership property, like many top properties in this area. I can't fault them for that, but whenever I stay at a hotel that is split this way, it often makes my stay feel like less of a focus of the property. I'm sure the added units allow for more facilities (additional pools, exercise rooms, restaurants, etc.) but I generally would prefer a place that is 100% focused on the hotel side of the business. One more thing - the location is OK but not great. Its not close to any town center and its on a pretty busy street, so much so that most of the property is (wisely) behind a fence on the road-side. This leads to a sense of being \"fenced in\" a bit as opposed to being nestled within a wine country town.

It is our home base for our annual trek to Napa and Sonoma. There isn't anyplace like it in Napa (or anywhere else for that matter). We love having our own little cottage with its rocking chairs on the front steps, the fire place, the comfy beds, and the bathroom with its heated tiles and wonderful indoor & outdoor shower. The back patio with its private garden, lounge chairs, outdoor dining table and beautiful landscape add to the experience. There is a great sense of being outside and being in the place you are visiting. There is a lot to say so here's my short list of highlights and things to consider. Location, Location, Location. Carneros Inn is a great spot if you want to spend time in both Sonoma and Napa. You are strategically located to get to locations in either place. If you are into Carneros chardonnay you are in the heartland. There are also many nice wineries right near the property so that you can sit out the Saturday and Sunday crowds that overtake Rt. 29 and the Silverado Trail on the weekend. Artessa is within walking distance. Carneros Inn's front desk and concierge staff are the best. Harley Carr, one of the ace concierge staff, provides excellent recommendations on where to find the best wine and food in Napa and Sonoma including setting up great personal tastings and keeping you far away from the drunk bridesmaid and bachelors motoring around Napa. His recommendations make for an excellent experience taking you to places you probably wouldn't have found on your own. This year they have Kindles so you can borrow a Kindle and read the latest. They also have plenty of interesting reads for those who prefer the physical reading experience rather than the digital one. The Hilltop Restaurant for guests only is an excellent place to relax after the trip to Napa. It looks over a beautiful horizon pool, a farm and the vineyards. At the Spa you will have great services and friendly staff. There is some spa misfiring going on here. Unlike other resort spas where you are taken to the locker room, here they send you in on your own where you forage for robes and spa shoes. The waiting room could use some more attention but you forget about all this when you have GREAT services. Having been there four times, it's not a fluke, it's not luck, it's how they do it. The products are nice, there's some nice, but expensive shopping at the little spa store. All in all a good experience. Farm, Boon Fly, and the Marketplace are very nice. Farm's outdoor fire pits and comfortable chairs make a good place to relax after a day of touring or spa-ing or wine tasting. The restaurant has a hip feel and a good wine list. The food is good but over priced in light of other restaurants in the Valley. Even taking a very expensive bottle of wine out of the equation, it was still one of the more expensive dinners in Napa - very good but not great. But again, the staff was tremendous, and patient, and very knowledgeable about the food and the wine. Everyone should go there once and then decide for yourself if you want to go back. Try the little fresh donuts a Boon Fly. They are delicious. The gym is great overlooking another pool. It looks like a barn. When the doors are open you can get your cardio while overlooking the pool. Unlike other hotels where you need to upload pictures to get a feel for the real look and feel of the place. The official pictures do the job. Here are a few things to consider. Carneros Inn requires you to pay for your entire stay at the time you book your stay. I understand the need to do this for folks who want to motor up from San Francisco for the weekend and who might be inclined to change their mind at the last minute, but having thousands of dollars tied up months in advance is ridiculous. They need a better plan - pay for the first two nights on booking (this would cover the weekenders) and then some other plan for the balance of the trip. We've also had some minor housekeeping issues - not having our room made up until late in the day (3pm or later) even when we left our room with the nice make up room light on by 9:30. This has been a problem when we are there on a Thursday or Friday. My guess is they are focusing on getting the rooms ready for the new guests. The housekeeping is great it's just the time of arrival that is an issue from time to time. The bottom line is that this is an amazing place with a great staff and great amenities. I love the outdoor shower architecturally integrated into the cottage. Every year we look around and we wind up back at the Carneros Inn.

The cottage (Peck 4) was immaculate, the grounds perfectly tended, the service warm and helpful. Our check in was very welcoming, we enjoyed a few glasses of a nice red while learning about the resort. The management had a nice gift and note waiting for us, congratulating us on our marriage. The weather was rainy and cool the first few nights we were in Napa--the fireplace in our room was perfect those nights. Room service was fast and friendly, even if it meant delivering extra \"EnviroLogs\" for the fireplace in a downpour. And we appreciated the later in the day room cleaning; we often spent the morning going for a run, using the gym, or having coffee in the hot tub that overlooks the vineyards, and did not want to return to a cleaning staff waiting outside our door. The look of the Inn is interesting-- a funky agricultural style that somehow looks rural and modern at once. Loved our \"back yard\" area, with the outdoor tub, radiant heaters over the lounge chairs, gas fire pit. Once the weather improved, we spent some time out there every night (even cancelled dinner reservations at Farm to have cottage dining by our fire pit...nice). (Also, note that you can probably get anything off the restaurant menus as room device: we ordered off-menu twice and the staff was happy to accommodate.) Any drawbacks? Carneros is at the southern end of the Valley, so expect to spend some time driving if you have activities planned in St Helena, Calistoga etc. This was only a minor inconvenience to us, as we usually don't plan to return home during our trips anyway. And there are worse ways to pass time than driving past the beautiful vineyards and wineries on the way. On a plus side, you will be among some beautiful vineyards. We ran up to Artesa Winery before they opened one morning (thanks, gate keeper for letting us in!). Stunning views, makes the run up the hill worth it, mostly. And we needed more time (and better weather) to enjoy all the activities and facilities on-site. Too much to do in Napa! (Try to arrange an Estate tour at Ladera on Howell Mountain, and go to the olive oil tour and tasting at Round Pond as a nice break from all the amazing cabs you'll be tasting.

It really isn't until you pass through the registration area and get your first glimpse of the sky, mountains and infinity pool from the main restaurant that you take a deep breath, exhale and think to yourself \"Hello, Carneros Inn.\" Just as your initial entrance to this property is deceiving and has you seriously wondering if you have made a costly mistake, the same goes for the journey to your cottage. The property's narrow streets are dotted on each side with what looks like small and smaller cottages squeezed onto every square inch of land separated by narrow paths and wood fences. Something about the space and the design gives you the distinct feeling that you may be in the deep south and that it's possible you will be accosted by a \"gator\" at any given moment. In the nick of time you open the door to your cottage and again think to yourself \"Well hello Carneros, I think we will be friends.\" The cottage (we were two couples staying in a two bedroom suite) was perfectly fine; spacious, well stocked and very comfortable with a full bath off each bedroom. Ironically, I found the decor to be a bit confused, much like the rest of the property (not to mention the management-see below), as it wasn't sure if it was a sleek Manhattan penthouse (marble dining table with ivory leather chairs) or a cool, casual, California cottage (painted white wood walls, wicker outdoor furniture and painted wood fence surrounding the unit). Hmm...odd but acceptable. As I said, the villa was very well equipped from the small, yet functional galley kitchen stocked with necessities like water and milk (even a bottle each of red and white wine - keep reading as this becomes a big issue), with a nice sized deck with outdoor grill, an outdoor fireplace with pre-made fire starter kits and several outdoor seating areas with individual blankets. There was a small outdoor hot tub and the bedrooms were comfortable with exceedingly fresh, white linen bedding and a bathroom with a shower that had a door leading directly into an outside shower. Oddly duplicative? Yes, but an interesting and very \"natural\" design making you wonder if you showering inside or out. Frankly, I still don't know. After all of this, how then, dear Carneros Inn, could things have taken such a turn as to land on the dark side of non-existent guest satisfaction? One word: Management. Immediately upon arriving at registration, there wasn't any warm welcome. I would call it a luke warm welcome with a side of smarmy. dWe arrived around 10:30 am and as they knew, we had travelled quite a far distance from out of state. We were told that our unit was not yet ready but that they had requested expedited housekeeping and they would call us as soon as it was ready. We were briefly shown the adjacent area of the property and sent on our way feeling like children told to go outside somewhere and play until called. We all felt it was strongly implied that we would be able to get into our cottage before the very late 4:00 pm technical check-in time. Having heard nothing by 2:00 pm we contacted them and were abruptly told that it still wasn't ready and that it would be ready at 4:00 pm. Annoying. Having run out of things to do/see over the last 5+ hours and now completely exhausted, we head back to the property shortly after 3:00 pm. We are once again, now tersely told, it is not ready, then arrogantly reminded that the check-in time is 4:00 pm and it would be ready at that time. We sit, we eat cheese, we drink wine, we try to laugh it off and of course, we wait...and wait. A young waiter, named Stephen, seemed to be the only one around with any sense whatsoever as to how to treat guests and he did an excellent job trying to diffuse the situation, and imagine this...to make us feel welcome. Time check: 4:33 pm. Management decides it is time to let us know, albeit unapologetically, that the air conditioning was broken but is now fixed so we can get in. Glory, glory hallelujah. As mentioned above, the unit came with a bottle of \"Shop-Carneros 2008 Pinot Noir\". We enjoyed it and given our deliriously exhausted state, decided it best to order room service for dinner and another bottle of this 2008 Pinot. Not to be caught wildly off guard related to the cost of our new found friend, I asked and was told it was $59, which was fine. The wine turned out to be $80 a bottle because of the room service fee (we always knew there would be a service fee) and over the course of the weekend, we ordered another bottle of the Pinot for a total of 2 bottles delivered to our cottage. Over the weekend, in addition to the room service and wine, we patronized the restaurant for breakfast 3 times, had spa treatments, lunch from \"The Market\" (their on-premise deli and gift shop), and purchased numerous gift items in the shop as well. It was while we were in The Market that we noticed something quite disturbing...the wine we were charged $80 a bottle for was being sold to anyone who could jump off a party bus for $25 a bottle! (The Market is not restricted to guests and is just off the main road.) Logically, we thought there must have been a mistake in our charge; we should have been charged maybe $40-$45 a bottle which would include the room service fee and seem reasonable given The Market's $25 price tag - not $80 a bottle. Upon check-out we pleasantly addressed this as an obvious honest mistake. Ah...afraid not. Although we gave very valid reasons why this wasn't a proper thing to do to guests who were spending $2,000 a night for the cottage, our complaint, clearly based on the principal of the matter versus the actual dollar amount, fell on deaf ears. The management was smug and glib and eventually offered us a $20 credit towards one of our breakfasts as compensation for the issue! They had no coherent or valid argument as to why this was appropriate but they just kept saying the same lame, arrogant, patronizing and dishonest statement, \"Oh...so sorry, but there is nothing we can do about it.\" Well, right back at you Carneros, as there is nothing I can do about the bad review you are now receiving that will be posted often and forwarded extensively. If The Carneros Inn wasn't motivated to deceive and gouge their guests, then why wouldn't they put one of their silly little notes on the complimentary bottle (said silliness, by the way, litter the cottage advising ludicrous things like the date the wild flowers in the bathroom were picked) telling guests that this wine could also be purchased directly for a reasonable price at The Market. The Carneros Inn seriously lacks proper guest service from management. They could take many a lesson from places such as The Ritz Carlton, Mandarin Oriental or an amazing property with equally amazing service, The Villa by Barton G. located in South Beach, Miami. Frankly, even young Stephen their restaurant waiter, could \"school\" them on guest treatment in a G- rated manner of beat down. Be sure to avoid The Carneros Inn if you expect a certain level of service for a couple grand a night and do not wish for a luke warm welcoming, late check-in, being price gouged, nickeled and dimed, patronized, insulted and unceremoniously dismissed - in that order. There are lots of other big fish in the wine country sea so accept my condolences, Carneros Inn\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re dead to me.

It was scheduled to be harvest weekend in Napa (although the peak harvest was pushed back a few weeks by weather) and I was delighted to find any space at any inn. The Carneros Inn was available and I jumped at the opportunity for a romantic weekend away. I would have been hard-pressed afterwards to deny the \"value\" of the experience. The complex is relatively small and set on one of the hillsides just off the main road through the Carneros region of Napa. As you drive through the gate up to registration you feel incredibly confused initially and soon discover your way around a complex that is designed to maximize privacy and intimacy. Staff members at registration were friendly and helpful and the staff generally were always available without being obtrusive. We were offered wine and fruit and chocolate at registration and the process was speedy and efficient. We were then escorted to our cottage by following a staff member on bicycle and got the basic lay of the land. My partner is a swimmer and loved the heated infinity adults-only pool (there are family pools on the property as well) at the top of the property near registration. From the right positions at the pool, one can see cattle graze on hillsides near beautifully manicured rows of grapes. Since I am a runner, I was especially pleased by the beautiful running paths on the wide well-marked shoulders of roads nearby. Our cottage was large and comfortable with an outside shower and fireplace. The bathroom had both a soaking tub and shower and every aspect was comfortable and well-designed without being ostentatiously showy. The bed linens were soft and only added to the overall experience. We had the opportunity to have breakfast/brunch next to the pool and had an excellent meal overlooking the vineyards nearby. Spending harvest time in Napa on a sunny weekend is a tough job, but somebody has to do it. We also had the opportunity to have a couples massage in the spa. Since there are extensive locker facilities (with steam room and sauna) in the spa, we were not troubled (as apparently some have been) by wearing bathrobes in the lodge. We were treated in a friendly professional manner at check-in and the locker room was clean and well-stocked with amenities.

We all enjoyed the castle- it was so much more authentic than I imagined. We did do the horse and carriage ride, which was a real treat for my daughter.

Although it was just the two of us this trip, it is a property that easily accommodates adult-only and family trips alike, and next time, we plan to bring the little one after seeing how family friendly it is without being overrun by kids. In fact, it wasn't over run by anybody - which is the beauty of the layout of the property itself. Before I go any further, I'm going to state the obvious: it is expensive, but we all know that prior to booking, and in relation to some of the other luxury properties in the area, it is reasonable; we found it to be absolutely worth the investment, especially after taking advantage of the discount since we booked 3 nights mid-week. We stayed in a King premier garden cottage, complete with front porch and rocking chairs, fireplace, spacious and totally private side yard, indoor-outdoor shower (this was way too much fun, I loved this feature, as did other guests - walking around you could recognize the water falling in the backyard and the delighted chatter) and heated bathroom floors (even in August, the chilly evenings lent themselves to use this feature, as well as the outdoor patio heater and fireplace.) The decor of the cottages was Restoration Hardware meets a Montauk bungalow. I absolutely adored it, and as a girl who is very picky about hotel bathrooms, this one knocked it out of the park. Clean, spacious, light, beautiful. Service was attentive at the adult pool without being annoying, the food was delicious, and the views throughout the property - but especially from the Hilltop pool and sitting areas - were FABULOUS. It was actually hard to leave the property to go wine tasting, and we spent much more time on site, (enjoying our garden and the heat lamp) that we originally expected to - which was a welcome change from our fast paced lives, and satisfied the true reason for this trip - lots of R & R. The grounds are beautiful, immaculate, and spacious - kudos to the landscape architect and maintenance team- there is plenty of quiet privacy, the perfect spot for a get away without the pomp and pretense of a typical luxury resort. The food at Farm was delicious, we dined on Sunday night - I highly recommend the lobster risotto and Diver scallops. Fantastic. And if Farm is closed when you are there, there is always food available, and it's always delicious. We had zero complaints about the restaurant schedules, although I did notice from some other reviewers that this was an issue for them. I simply recommend noting the different restaurant schedules and plan accordingly.

First the one and only complaint I have about the hotel is that they didn't acknowledge our anniversary. Not that I'm expecting an upgrade and a bottle of champagne, but we are in wine country, how about a glass of wine? A note maybe? Other then that tiny thing the hotel made up for it with everything else and there was no need to find fault. The reviews speak for themselves. This hotel is fantastic. The concern I had going into the trip was if the hotel was in a good location having not been to the area before and I was uncertain if the location was what we wanted. We originally looked at hotels in Calastoga, and we were really happy we didn't end up there as it was a bit out of the way at the way top of Napa. We were also concerned that the Carneros would be too far from the restaurants in Yountville and we would spend too much time driving, however it was only a 15 minute drive. Here's the short of it, if you stay at the Carneros, you have this breathtaking property and facility that you won't find in Yountville. Words cannot describe it, and the trade off is the 15 minute drive to Yountville. If you stay in Yountville, your in this quaint little town where you can easily walk around but you miss the expansiveness and sheer beauty of the countryside. Which matters more? Next time, maybe will try Yountville, but you won't find any fault with the Carneros, we were in heaven.

Carneros seemed to have the same vibe, so we took a flier. It was a great decision. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read my reviews before, I have high \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perhaps impossibly high \u00e2\u20ac\u201c standards for hotels. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get me wrong \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t about price. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed and crowed about $80 Courtyard by Marriott hotels that stand and deliver what they promise, and screamed like a scalded cat about high-end resorts that just go through the motions. Carneros was such a perfect experience; I may include them in my hotel hall of fame. They succeeded at meeting and exceeding all our expectations. First, the grounds are lovely. The property apparently was built on the site of an old mobile-home lot. The construction is tasteful, in keeping with the landscape, and built with an eye to sustainability. When we arrived, the front desk crew and concierge staff was unhurried, helpful and seemingly truly interested in making sure we enjoyed our stay. They showed us the grounds then directed us to our a very well-appointed free-standing bungalow with ample interior room, a private patio and outdoor shower. We immediately headed over for the adult-only pool, where the staff there took excellent care of us while we let the sun burn away the mold from our soggy Northwest bodies. The pool had a little road noise interrupting the tranquility, but had big views and was a grand feature. The food in the informal dining room was great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c breakfast especially. Again, the staff there went above and beyond, doing as far as to dig through the lost and found to loan my wife a pair of sunglasses when decided to dine outside and the sun was affecting our Pacific NW mole-like light sensitivity. The formal dining was a bit of a disappointment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the executive chef tried \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unsuccessfully \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to convince us that the farm-raised Atlantic salmon was far superior to the wild stuff we consider table-stakes in Seattle. We tried not to openly giggle as he made his case, but we failed. The little things, here, stood out. For example, lightning-fast wireless throughout, and no ridiculous up-charge for access; when I asked if there were papers for sale other than the free, daily Oakland Chronicle, the immediately offered to have the NYT and WSJ delivered daily; expert housekeeping that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss anything in the two-times-daily cleaning. We also took a couple of yoga classes in the fitness center - top notch instructors and a great vibe there as well. So, if the management of the Plumpjack Resorts are reading this, know you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a great crew and a great property.

This was my second stay at the Carneros, and I have nothing but generous, overflowing compliments for the hotel managers, staff, and maintenance workers. The grounds are beautifully maintained, and service is low-key and friendly but precise. It's everything a hotel should be! The Carneros Inn is located about a 15 minute drive from Yountville (where the desirable restaurants -- Bottega, ad hoc, Bouchon, etc -- are clustered). It's not the most convenient location if you plan on spending your time in Napa toward the north end near Calistoga. My fiance and I spent four full days in Napa this past month visiting wineries all over Napa (including Calistoga) and relaxing at the Carneros' wonderful pool and spa. Location wasn't an inconvenience for us at all. Every day, knowing that the heated chaise lounges in our private patio where we would drink wine was waiting for us after dinner made me quite content actually. If you plan your winery visits so that you're not constantly driving up and down Route 29, where you stay in Napa isn't that significant. Enough has been glowingly written about the Carneros' award-winning spa (it's definitely deserved!) and their amazing food at Boon Fly, FARM, and the Hilltop Dining Room. All are great options, even in Napa's crowded restaurant scene. FARM is likely the restaurant I would least recommend about the three -- it's generally crowded at night and the entrees aren't anything you won't find back at home (assuming you're from an urban area that has a fair number of organic/locavore-focused restaurants). Boon Fly has wonderful breakfasts, which should always include their baker's dozen donuts. I call them doughy bites of heaven; my fiance had his doubts about the donuts, given the number of superlatives I had used to describe their perfection. But he is a convert and devout follower now. Eat. Those. Donuts. The Carneros is really a semi-autonomous village of sorts that caters to wealthy vacationers. There's a Market that sells organic produce and products (including a small selection of wines) as well as a post office that can ship wine back to your home for an additional fee. Everyone stays in their individual private cottages, replete with all the amenities you will find in a five-star city hotel. There's not much I can say about the Carneros except stay there!

We know for a fact that our cottage was not cleaned until a good few hours later - so we could have been in enjoying it still in that time, rather than it being empty, and us having to leave feeling disgruntled.

We stayed in a 2 king bed suite, since my SO's brother was in town. The suite was certainly the match of Solage, a chic \"restoration hardware\" look, with a small, bull full kitchen including fridge/freezer, dishwasher, Viking range, sink, coffee maker, kettle and assorted pots pans and cutlery etc. (there is even a washer/dryer in the closet). The dining/family room was a good size with large flat screen tv, couch, chairs, coffee table and LCD TV with Bose surround sound and Direct TV (there is also flat panel tvs in each bedroom, with directTV and dvd players, bose etc) The ability to open the family/dining room completely out to the enclosed back yard is wonderful; with outside lounge and dining, including a fireplace (and a gas BBQ also) while the garden is not huge, it is very private and comfortable, with your own hot tub to hand there is almost no reason to leave your room the whole weekend! We were in the Robleno area of the property which is relatively close to the main gate, Farm etc, which in turn is close to the main road bounding the property. The downside of this is of course you can hear the heavy traffic heading to/from Napa. This could be a major issue for some, especially compared to Solage, which despite being next to the Silverado Trail, is much quieter than Carneros. We dined at the superb Farm restaurant, the food was spectacular, and easily on a par with, if not exceeding that of SolBar. The restaurant and adjacent bar/lounge seem a lot less \"claustrophobic\" than Solage's SolBar area. The adult pool is located at the top of the hill near registration, the spa, and the main restaurant, it has some great views, and the hot tub is nice, it is a lot smaller than the main pool at Solage, but the pool services is about the same AWFUL. You have more chance of drinking from a desert mirage than getting one from the pool staff at either location! Room service seemed a bit more on the ball than the pool guys ... the continental breakfast was good, as were the hot items, on the whole I preferred the CI menu to that of Solage ... Overall I think both properties are about the same, I think Solage is a better, quieter location for Napa etc than Carneros, but in terms of accommodations, service and food both properties are about equivalent.

The Carneros Inn may be a little off the beaten path, but (A) that was exactly what we were looking for in a honeymoon, and (B) the location was positioned perfectly to tour both Sonoma and Napa locations. Everything was PERFECT! The cottage was amazing...from the bed, to the porch, to the fireplace, to the bathroom. Uh, the bathroom was wonderful! The outdoor shower was such a treat. Aside from the cottage, the grounds were superb, as was the staff. We had some delicious meals at the restaurants and were able to take advantage of the heated pool and hotub on multiple occassions. Walking the vineyard trail in the morning was so picturesque. The rolling hills and hot air balloons were like a postcard, and the cows grazing were so much fun to see as well. Wherever you go within the resort, there's bottled water and wine. We even took the bikes they provide out for a ride one day. It was very easy to hop on 29 and drive up the Napa Valley, and almost as easy to drive up Sonoma.

Out of fairness I've waited for the general manager to email be back, regarding out stay, and he never repsonded to my email. So...here goes. If you can afford to book a cottage with the fire pit/tub, do. You are rewarded with rooms that have shutters and are dark at night. If not, you will be in a room that is virtually lit up all night. Why? Thin roman shades and cottage lights from neighboring cottages that are on all night. One downer to the tub, it will only fit one, or two if you are a very small person. Thought that sounded great in theory but was quite uncomfortable to enjoy together. Room service was uneven. Terrific one night, great burger, terrible at breakfast. Cold food, hour wait. I felt vindicated for complaning when I read a former review commenting on the same issue. When we complained about the light the next am, literally everyone at the front desk looked at us like we had landed in a space ship. I asked if they had eye shades, and no they didn't. The front desk did explain that they're some people who like a well lit room to sleep in, so if they are disoriented in the middle of the night they can find their way around. That's a first, truly. And, he was so ernest about the explanation. I thought the # 1 rule to any hotel is black out shades, so if you are traveling and you are jet lagged you can actually sleep. Or, in our case, sleeping in. Their will be no sleeping in at this hotel since some of the cottages are east facing and you know what that means, up with the chickens with the thin roman shades. It is also strangely corporate sponsered???. Other quirks. At wine hour you will the odd feeling that you're on a car sales lot. You are. The wine hour is held in a residence cottage with nice people trying their to sell a cottage. Also, the wine hour is given by various wineries who are (surprise!) selling their wine. That said, we'd never stay their again. Not for that price. I've wanted to stay at this property for years, so disapointing. I hope they will take the time to listen to their customers, and do what other hotels do when they have a challenge. For instance, at the SB Biltmore you get ear plugs by your bed at night. There is a train one can hear, they accomodate you. Maybe having eye shades would be a brilliant thing to offer? Better yet, switch out those cheap shades and put something proper in.

Overall, the service wasn't quite as meticulous as it was during our prior visits. But that's not to say it was bad or cold. Perhaps staff turnover is taking a bit of a toll on the details. Our room in the Haire section had a tight, horizontal floor plan that was a bit confining. However it was very clean and the private yard seemed a bit larger and open than prior ones. An outdoor heating lamp and gas fireplace allowed us to linger in the yard well into January dusk. A complimentary half-bottle of Chardonnay (appreciation for our return visit) was delivered warm, but it was a nice gesture. In terms of food, Boon Fly Cafe is a fun breakfast nook, but the seating is limited and tight so get there early. One thing to watch for is that the Hilltop Dining Room and the Farm are closed several days of the week, and this highly limits dining options in the immediate area. That said, a rejuvenated Napa Center, with several good restaurants like Celadon and the funky Bounty Hunter Wine Bar, is a mere 10-15 minute ride. The resort is very well situated for exploring Sonoma Center and wineries as well. If you like classic Chardonnays like us, you're in the right spot here.

I am perfectly happy to pay a lot for a great experience. This hotel is not it. -Check in people were rude and condescending to us upon arrival. You have to go through a gate and call the front desk to be let into the compound. Not very inviting. -The bed linens were cheap (made in Pakistan, not to be a snob but for a 5* hotel they should be Italian linens), the pillows hard and uncomfortable. It is so disappointing to pay for a 5* resort and have an uncomfortable bed. -A Queen size bed? Really? -The room lay out was so awkward. Long and narrow and hard to get around the bed. There was no where to place luggage or put clothes away- except a tiny little closet large enough to hang 5 things. They had to put my suitcase in the bathroom next to the shower! My husbands bag on the couch! My small suitcase on the tiny little desk. -They charge you $30 per bottle if you want to take one of the toiletries from the room. Not that I liked the toiletries, but really? They should either be refillable ceramic or glass containers (eco friendly) or plastic ones to take away. I have never heard of charging guests for small shampoo bottles. -I think they must have bought the furnishings from Ikea- very cheap and no clothing storage. -Location: this hotel is not in the nice part of Napa Valley. It is south of Napa near Vallejo. So you have to drive a while to get to any of the cute downtown areas & nice restaurants (Younteville, St. Helena, Rutherford). From the pool you have a nice view of Vallejo, industrial power lines, and the highway that leads into Napa valley. -Room Service: Is printed on computer paper in a folder. There are about 4 options for breakfast every thing really heavy and greasy. It was strange they did not have healthier, lighter breakfast options. -Overall the materials were just so cheap, the doors, the curtains, the light fixtures. It made the hotel (a new construction) seam like it was dated. And did not seam inviting or comfortable. Positives: -It was nice to have your own little cottage, I just wish that they were a little more posh. - The gym was nicely equipped and I think that they had some group classes offered in the mornings.

There is literally not enough room to put down two suitcases apart from having them sit right at the entrance to the room. With that said, the outdoor space connected to the room was bigger than the room itself and quite beautiful. When we mentioned to the front desk that the room was tiny we were told \"well most of our guests don't spend too much time in the room so they don't seem to mind\". Huh? Well then using that philosophy I should have stayed in a cheap hotel instead of one that charges $450-700 per night for an entry level room. We were looking forward to eating at the restaurant there which is highly acclaimed . . except that it was closed on Monday and Tuesday night. Really? In the middle of the high season? We then tried to bury our disappointment in some spa services which were only available at extremely limited times and the front desk offered no help. Bottom line, if these rooms were $150-250 per night, I would say its probably worth it.

We rarely rave about breakfast, but we had breakfast all three days at the Boone Fly Cafe, which offers the most delicious food and friendly service. In retrospect we should have tried lunch or dinner here too. The one thing that was not superlative was dinner at The Farm. It was just okay. As others have suggested, the hilltop pool was absolutely gorgeous. We sat out there for a few hours and I thought the service was pretty good (I know other reviewers thought otherwise, maybe we just got a good day). We did a couples, side by side mineral bath. I don't know if we would do it again (very pricey for 1/2 hour) but glad we did it once for the experience. What was not so nice was the view of the hotel's retention (detention?) pond/pool as you are relaxing in the tubs or sitting on the back deck of the spa area. There's probably not much they can do about it but they should do a little more to obscure that view. Also, there could be more privacy/serenity in the spa waiting room, which seems to be a primary route for the staff to walk through as you are sitting in your robe drinking chilled mint-infused water (which was delicious).

Concierge knowledge and information provided concerning area wineries wasn't always accurate or complete. Seems like they could make this more seemless. 2. Hillside pool, aka adults' pool, lacked very good service. Poolside attendants didn't stay outside most of the time, and instead disappeared into the hillside building. They would be gone for 45 minutes and you'd have to go hunt for someone. It's a no brainer that someone should be posted all the time as the hotel would make more money that way through guest purchases of food and alcohol. 3. Spa could be a little bit more serene. My massage was excellent. However, the relaxation area outside and inside had people walking in and out (example, one of the attendants was taking out the trash through the relaxation room inside bringing it outside, through the relaxation porch, presumably to the dumpster.

I must note that following our stay I received a survey to complete from the hotel via e-mail. Upon completing it and noting the pros and cons I listed above, the hotel called my house the next day to discuss areas for improvement. They also said that they were going to mail a bottle of wine from the company's winery to our house. This is a good sign that management cares and is to be commended.

Very comfy robes, a spacious bathroom and plenty of free bottled water. Awesome. The service at the hotel was phenomenal, from check-in to the pool service to the concierge and the front desk throughout our stay. Unpretentious and friendly, but clearly willing to go the extra mile to make this a great visit. We took in some spa treatments one afternoon, and though pricey, were thoroughly relaxing and recharging (I recommend the couples massage). The lounge at the spa is filled with a great selection of magazines, comfy chairs and a really nice atmosphere. We also ate at Farm one night and though the service was pretty slow, the food was among one of the better meals I've had in a while (I recommend the filet/short rib entree and the pea soup--yum!) The proximity to other activities was great--we borrowed a couple bikes one morning and took a ride around the beautiful back roads. Another day, we drove about 15 minutes and went on a wonderful 5 mile hike. Downtown Napa is not far, so you're close to many restaurants. A few cons: -the bed--Although not terrible, the bed felt very soft and although I'm usually a heavy sleeper, I kept waking up in the middle of the night and did not wake up feeling as rested as usual. The pillows were also not that comfortable, however, housekeeping did their best to provide better ones when we requested them. -the entertainment system--The hotel doesn't have an on-demand movie system, but you can borrow DVDs from the front desk. The two DVDs we borrowed were scratched to the point that the DVD player couldn't read them. The netflix DVD we brought from home skipped every 4 seconds and we had to shut it off midway through the opening credits. Not a big deal as we didn't want to get away to watch movies, but I expected a slightly better entertainment system. -the pool--I loved that there was a separate adult-only pool with a wonderful hot tub and a great view of the vineyards. However, it was quite crowded when we were there (4th of july weekend), every single chair was taken and it was a bit noisy (probably in part because a whole party of people on the other end of the pool were pretty intoxicated).

I had been to the Carneros Inn 5 years ago when it was still pretty new, and I LOVED it then. It was much smaller (the homes and the \"town square\" and whatnot were still being constructed, and I don't remember the spa being there), and the vibe was 5-star but very laid back and quirky. I feel like it has lost a little of that now that it's bigger -- I got the sense it's now a bit of a wedding mill in the summertime, and it seemed a little more buttoned up than I remembered. But it's still great. The great: -The cottages are darling -- each one like a little house. They have hardwood floors (love that!), Eames chairs, fireplaces, and outdoor showers -- very cozy but modern and fresh. We booked a Premier Garden Cottage and were very happy with it. -The adults-only pool on the Hilltop is fab. Absolutely gorgeous setting. Pool attendants were great, the sunscreen they offer smells like coconuts (hey, it's the little things), and it's so relaxing to look out over the vineyards in a quiet, kid-free zone. -Great service overall. Everyone was friendly and clearly wanted to meet our needs. The pretty good: -The spa was good but not the best. My boyfriend and I had a couples massage, and it was good ... but didn't go as smoothly as it could have. The massage therapists seemed a little flustered -- they ran out of heated massage oil halfway through, they kept getting up and walking around to get more oil or adjust the heater or something, and my boyfriend said that his therapist seemed to have lost track of time and didn't have much time left to massage his back (which is the area he most wanted de-knotted). The locker rooms are fine, and the lounge area is small but nice. There's also an outdoor area, but it looks out onto a parking lot and industrial-looking reservoir -- not the same gorgeous vista you see from the pool. Also, we had to traipse through the reception area to get to couples treatment room, which my boyfriend hated. But we still walked away very relaxed and happy after our treatments. -The food was okay. We eat mostly vegetarian food and fish, and we were bummed about the lack of healthy stuff on the room service menu and in both Farm and Boon Fly (and by the pool). Lots of burgers, fish and chips, pizza, chicken, etc. on the more casual menus, and not as much inventive but healthy California cuisine as we had hoped at Farm. We found things to eat and were fine, but definitely not blown away. Farm was a little snootier than I expected. -There isn't much shade at the pool -- no umbrellas (I think because of the wind) and no tree cover or anything. We started to feel a little crispy after a while and would have loved to be able to lounge under an umbrella for a bit. The not so great: -The resort's website says that there is an infinity-edged lap pool and a children's pool at the family and fitness pool complex. I assumed that meant a separate pool for kids and a pool set aside for laps. We're pretty hardcore swimmers, so we showed up at the lap pool Sunday morning with our swim fins and goggles and whatnot, to find that the lap pool is also a kids' pool. The separate kids' pool was small and shallow and totally empty, and the lap pool was full of kids. The pool manager tried to clear half the pool so we could swim laps, which was nice of him, but it didn't really work because the kids kept drifting into our half and I almost mowed one of them down. My boyfriend also got spit on by a little boy. We were displeased. We feel like you can't call it a lap pool if it's actually a kids' pool -- at least they could have designated some hours that are lap swimming only, or just call it what it is so we know to leave our fins at home. -The cottages are really cute, and we liked that we had a private little yard with an outdoor heater, but the landscaping back there really left a lot to be desired. We get that the resort doesn't want to use any more water than they already are, but our little yard was basically just deck and dirt -- could definitely have used some drought-resistant plants back there to spruce it up. The furniture layout was really awkward ... it wasn't an inviting space. Not a big deal because we spent 80% of our day at the pool anyway -- and we loved the front and the interior of the cottage -- but the yard was definitely not a plus. Overall we really enjoyed our stay, and we'll probably be back.

Those people couldn't have been more wrong! The Carneros Inn felt like an oasis. When driving up to check in, we could see how beautiful the grounds were. We were met by friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable staff. The concierge was excellent. Our room was perfect. The bathroom was my favorite part as the floors were heated and the shower was both indoor and outdoor. The bed and linens were plush and comfy as well. The spa experience was awesome. The massage tables were even heated. After a morning yoga class, I had a wrap and a massage and it was the best spa treatment I have ever had in my life. It was much better than the spa treatments I have had at Sonoma Mission Inn and Spa a few years earlier (the last time we got to go away). I need to mention that the fitness center also had a yoga studio. That was a bonus because it is not mentioned on their website. The yoga instructors were knowledgeable and taught great classes that accommodated all levels of students. There are 2 pools. The one with the incredible view, was for adults only-which is great if you are traveling without your kids. We had lunch poolside after our spa treatments. It was the most relaxing day! The food at the pool was excellent. The food everywhere at the hotel was excellent. It was the best room service we ever had-ever!

Because of our anniversary the resort treated us to a bottle of champagne and a card, which was a nice touch. The spa was great but expensive. Not the best massage of my life but relaxing to say the least. My only minor complaints... We paid more for a premier garden cabin, with the photos for this particular room on their website having a larger backyard seemingly by itself and not surrounded by other cabins. Our backyard however was much smaller than expected and less private as one of the walls was an adjoining cabin and another adjoining cabin could see into our backyard if they tried. The photos on their site are misleading in that regard. The landscaping in the backyard was just a bunch of weeds and really really ugly which to me meant that no upkeep was being done. Why not just cover the landscaping/weeds with some pretty river rocks instead?

From the service to the rooms to the beautiful property, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. At check in we were greeted right away and offered a glass of wine, exactly what I wanted on a trip to wine country. The reception staff were very pleasant and sincere, they were very focused on making sure we were enjoying ourselves. The Concierge helped us with wineries and restaurant reservations - their knowledge and experience with the little known wineries was impressive and allowing them to plan my itinerary took the work out of my hands and gave me a chance to relax. The bell staff was great - he showed us down to our rooms and told us all about the hotel. Definitely the best check in experience I've ever had! They have bikes for guests to use, so we went on a little bike ride around the Carneros region. It is so incredibly beautiful... rolling hills and vines all around. The views from the hotel are spectacular. We were told that you have to rent one of the Vineyard View rooms to get the view from your cottage, but we rented the Harvest Cottage, with a tub and fireplace in our private backyard and I loved it! I would certainly get the Harvest Cottage again... the perfect romantic getaway!!! The rooms were so nice, very relaxing and well thought out. The TVs were a little weird but when I mentioned this to the staff they told me that they were about to replace every TV. I love that they listen to their guests and they really gave me the impression that they are always working to improve the guest experience. THe bathrooms were incredible, they have those heated floors, wonderful bath tub and even the coolest outdoor shower!! The bed was the most comfortable ever, I even asked the concierge where I can get one just like it. The backyard was such a cool concept. We had our own outdoor table with a heater and umbrella. So one day we went down to the Market (their own grocery,deli,etc - they thought of everything!) and got some wine and cheese and just sat in our backyard soaking up the sun. We ate at Farm, their fine dining restaurant - the best meal we had on our trip. And there is this fantastic lounge that you can sit by the fire and drink wine... we could have stayed their all night. We also had breakfast at both the Boon Fly and the restaurant by the pool.

Then we followed the bellman in our car to our room where he explained how to use everything. Very, very nice. Now at this point I need to tell you that even though I'm young and pretty savvy I couldn't figure out 1. How to turn the TV on 2. How to turn the heated bathroom floors on & 3. I started a fire in the fireplace without opening the flue which caused my room to smoke up and the alarm to go off. Never, never did the staff make me feel like any of this was an inconvenience. I greatly appreciated that. They were so nice each time coming to the room very quickly (in some hotels it takes forever!) and showing me how to work everything. The room was beautiful as well. So well equipped. Each room is it's own cottage with a small, very private, fenced backyard that included two lounge chairs, a dining table with heat lamp, and an outdoor shower. We were in the least expensive room and I felt it was just gorgeous. The first night there we went to dinner at The Farm. When we arrived the waiter brought over two glasses of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary (When we made our reservations for the hotel and restaurant they asked me if we were celebrating anything special and I had told them it was our anniversary) So nice! The food was excellent and the restaurant very beautiful. Our waiter was wonderful too! When we arrived back at the room there was a bucket with a very nice bottle of CADE wine with two glasses and a note from Philip Kendall, the hotel's general manager, wishing us a happy anniversary. We were blown away. The grounds are beautifully maintained and I loved the fact that they had two pools; one for families, and one for adults. I love being able to lounge quietly by the pool but I also understand that when families are on vacations children want to play and have a good time. The two pools makes it so everyone is happy. We were the March 7-9 so the weather wasn't very warm but the pool was heated so we were still able to swim. One day I ordered a pomegranate lemonade by the pool the bartender brought it over to me and told me that he had run out of pomegranate so he made it with cranberry instead so their would be no charge. Seriously! This hotel has the best service I've seen in a long, long time. The people that work their seem genuinely happy to help you. Even in the market I was looking for a honey I had had at the hotel she said they didn't sell it but would find out what it was and let me know. And she did. Again, above and beyond. Never did I encounter any attitude from anyone. The only hiccup was that one day we got back to the room around 3:30 and they were just cleaning our room, a bit disappointing because we were looking to take a quick nap, not a big deal at all.

Upon arrival, we were greeted by very courteous staff, and were given the full low-down on all the amenities we had access to. Jim, our super nice and knowledgeable guide, then had us follow his golf cart in our car to our cottage. There are no rooms at this inn--everyone has their own private cottage. Each cottage has its own mini, private \"backyard\" with a deck, seating area, and enclosed outdoor shower--you access this by opening the door from the indoor shower. Standing under the rain shower head with the sun on your face is a wonderful experience! The cottage is wonderfully equipped--big flat screen with an accordion-style mount, so you can pull it from the wall and angle it to your liking, whether you want to watch from the desk, the bed, or the sitting area (loveseat and club chair). The toiletries, furnishings, and amenities in the cottage were all lovely and luxurious, and the bubbly and fruit/cheese platter they brought after we'd settled in was a perfect touch. The Carneros Inn property is breathtaking--we took many walks on the grounds, through the gardens, and around the buildings. The fitness center is quite large and full of the latest equipment. We had an incredible dinner at FARM, and a delicious breakfast at Boon Fly Cafe. We had a fantastic Couples' Massage at the SPA early one morning, and walked across the path to FARM's outdoor terrace for breakfast in our spa robes. We drank Mimosas in the morning sun, while overlooking the beautiful valley and the pool. Then we swam for a bit and then followed that with a mini nap on one of the hammocks. We played Bocce at one of the Bocce courts. They also had bikes to lend, but we didn't get around to it. The Inn is perfectly situated for exploring Napa Valley.

We ate at both Farm and Boon Fly Cafe which are the two restaurants on property. Farm had a beautiful and quaint feel to it, however I did not enjoy my meal. I decided to try duck for the first time, and through no fault of the chef, realized I am not a fan. My husband ordered a delicious pork meal, which we both really enjoyed. Boon Fly was fantastic for both breakfast and dinner. I recommend the jalapeno benedict...it's to die for. The poolside restaurant was good, but pricey. I suggest ordering a cheese plate while sipping your drink of choice by the amazing pool. As for vinyards to visit, it's personal preference, but I liked the Cakebread tasting best. The staff there had the most relaxed and fun attitude and the wine was my favorite among all the places we visited. On your way to the vinyards, you must stop at Oakville Grocery for a picnic lunch. The sandwiches were absolutely delicious and we were told this place was a local favorite. The picnic area outside was cute for a quick lunch. Our cottage was beautiful. There was a large, luxurious bathroom which also featured an outdoor shower that I did not use, but looked old and unkempt. The bathroom also had heated floors, which added a nice touch to the chilly nights. The outdoor area of our little cottage was very cute and private with lounge chairs, heaters, and a picnic table. It was a really neat spot. The room was modern and comfortable, but could use more space for luggage and clothes. As for the location, one could easily bike to vinyards from the resort. I would plan to make a day of it if you choose to travel this way and leave early. We used our rental car and were able to visit 3 vinyards and have lunch (we got off to a late start). The spa and pool were both fantastic at this resort. I had a massage as well as a facial and really enjoyed both. The spa staff are very friendly and make you feel really comfortable. I'm not one to lounge in a bathrobe, but felt I could without feeling awkward on the pretty deck. The only complaint I have is that there was some construction going on outside the spa, which took away from the cool views on the spa deck. The pool is the best I've ever seen. Words can't describe the view and feeling you will experience at this pool. It was serene and breathtaking. Even if you don't stay here, definitely check out the resort's pool area on a visit to this place. It is well worth it to have lunch on the patio.

Carneros Inn has a rustic feel with a lot of the amenities you would get in a big city type of hotel. Located at the southern end of California's beautiful Napa wine region, the hotel sported many of the rolling vineyard views that make it a popular destination. When we first arrived, we were quite smitten with the level of service. The entry area where they check you in had a few staffers there who made us feel quite welcome. With cordial service and conversational style, we knew the service would be to our liking. They gave us the obligatory introduction champagne while they checked us in and gave us the layout of the property. The rooms are a little different. They do very much resemble high-end trailer park places. With tin corrugated tin roofs and set in small of groups of 6 or 8 rooms, they are an odd mix of luxury and country style living. The rooms feature a king size bed, a medium-sized bathroom, and a nice tub with both an indoor and outdoor shower. Each room has its own little firepit area and a nice little outdoor area along with a front porch area that looks out on the other rooms in the grouping. This gives it a little bit of a community feel, so if you are looking for isolated bungalows, this is not the place for you. The property has a couple of restaurants (Farm and another place I cannot remember the name to). We had breakfast at the unnamed place, which was excellent. Green Eggs and Ham is a must-have dish for anyone who likes eggs florentine. The restaurant has a distinct diner feel, so again, this is not the place to go for a secludeped high-end type meal. We had dinner at Farm one night, which was fantastic. The corn soup was fantastic, and the chef even provided us the recipe so we could try our best to mimic when we got home (we did quite well, actually). Farm is an exquisite restaurant with great food and a very good wine selection. The prices are high, but the service, ambiance, and food justified it. As a frame of reference, we did eat at French Laundry later on the same trip, and the Farm food, while not as good, did feature the best single item we ate (the aforementioned corn soup). The upper grounds have a beautiful infinity pool, which looked to be mostly unused in May when we were there. We did watch the sunrise from the jacuzzi, which was a stunning sight. They serve pool-side food, so we enjoyed a lunch and the views. The manager introduced himself and spent 20 minutes talking with us, a nice personal touch. We also had a couples massage and enjoyed the mineral bath overlooking the vineyards. The tubs overlook a mostly gorgeous view, though there was some construction to the right that made it less than perfect. The massages were good, and the bath was refreshing. They provided champagne and rose petals on our first night, a small detail that speaks to the service levels here. Overall, the place is expensive but beautiful. If you are looking true high-end, this is probably not the perfect place, but it is great for something that offers friendly and high-end mixed. The location is a little bit odd, since it is a bit south relative to the rest of the gems in the wine area.

Here's why: 1. The setting. The hotel is a collection of 80-something cottages set amidst rolling hills and vineyards between Sonoma and Napa, meaning all of the major sights in both valleys are just a short drive away. The landscaping is flawless, and the whole place feels like a Twenties-era resort town or Pleasantville on a small scale. 2. The rooms, or rather \"cottages.\" Each of these is free-standing, arranged in land-scaped cul-de-sacs with gravel footpaths between them, plus large, truly-private garden patios complete with an outdoor heater and shower (which is amazing). The style takes the vernacular of the farms and vineyards nearby and gives it a fresh, modern spin. It's Martha Stewart meets Phillipe Starck. Oh yeah-- did I mention the rooms have huge soaker tubs, flat-sceen TVs, and real wood-burning fireplaces (which are almost extinct in hotels these days)? One tip: Ask for a room near the Hilltop to guarantee no traffic noise from the highway. Also, from what we could see there was no advantage to paying more for a cottage adjacent to the vineyards, since your garden walls shielded the view anyways. 3. The service. Amazing from the get-go, when you get poured a nice glass of red wine at reception (which is then refilled prior to your drive to your cottage). The staff is attentive and professional, but friendly in a very California kind of way. They actually have conversations with you, instead of simply exchanging pleasantries. The concierge staff deserves a special mention-- we've never experienced better pre-stay planning, complete with detailed maps. Every recommendation proved perfect. 4. The food. It's great. Make a reservation before you go, or you'll be out of luck at Farm for dinner. We ate breakfast at the Hilltop Dining Room rather than the Boon Fly Cafe-- the menu was basically the same, but the view is better and there were no crowds at all. Minibars are stocked only with water and pop-- but there are amazing snacks and beverages at the Market on the property (milk chocolate with maplewood bacon in it, anyone?). 5. The amenities. The hilltop pool is saltwater, with one of the best views you can imagine. Best of all, kids are banned, since they have their own pool nearby. A welcome touch.

When I asked for recommendations from co-workers, I got the usual Meadowood and Auberge suggestions. I went out on a limb with Carneros, on the basis of the website and Tripadvisor comments. Without a doubt, I'm glad I chose Carneros. The property and rooms are very nice. Very modern with clear high-end touches. Many high end hotels spend all their money on the common areas, and leave the actual room feeling a bit dingy and outdated. Not this place - it felt like a well decorated private residence. The high point of the rooms are the bathroom (my wife actually liked taking a bath - something she never does in most hotels) and the courtyard outside (we fell asleep on the oversized chaise lounge several nights under the heater). The pools are both very well done, with attentive servers and a good bar-type menu for lunch/snacks. We did not eat any dinners on the property, so I can't comment on the Farm. Boonfly for breakfast was fine, but not extraordinary. But the staff is what sets this place apart from many of the top tier hotels I've stayed at. We were greeted immediately upon driving up (the small scale of this place helps provide personal attention). My wife and I spent less than an hour at the pool the first night before dinner, but upon arriving the next day the same pool attendant remembered our drinks and went out of his way to serve us. Small touches like that go a long way in my opinion. Pros * Staff is top notch from top to bottom * Rooms are luxurious and feel like new (the only caveat as has been noted is the oldish TV but we didn't really use it anyway) * Common areas are well done - the pools are a great place to go after a day of winetasting. Workout facility is small but nice as well * Rural setting is relaxing but still fairly convenient to Napa and Yountville restaurants/activities * Seemed like a good value versus some of the obvious alternatives at least when I was comparing pricing. Especially nice was that they don't ding you for small stuff - in-room cokes/waters are free and refilled every day, and they give you nice coffee to make in the room. Didn't feel nickle-and-dimed at all Cons (pretty minor compared to Pros above) * The spa is a bit pricey. We had a great massage, but paid $125+tip each for 45 mins.

When you first arrive, it seems very spread out, but once you familiarize yourself with the layout, the pathways provide short walks to everything. They will also send a staffer to drive you to your on-site destination in a large,golf cart type vehicle should you choose not to walk. We utilized that service on one evening when it was drizzling and we were dressed for dinner at The Farm. The resort is very clean, quiet and relaxing. We loved the heated tile floors and indoor/outdoor shower in our cottage. Staff is very friendly and extremely helpful. Dinner at The Farm was a true dining experience and breakfasts at the Boonfly Cafe were delicious but a bit uninspired. I would expect more fresh veggies and fruit in their dishes to match the \"farm\" feeling. We did encounter one distressing event during the final night of our stay. We had around $200 stolen from our wallets while we were gone. This has never happened to us before and we are frequent travelers, both domestically and internationally. I must admit that we were lulled into a sense of security by the upscale and quiet atmosphere of the place and failed to use the in-room safe for our valuables. In hindsight; I'm embarassed by my lapse in judgement but the staff never once made us feel that we were to blame. Thankfully, the staff, security and management were very understanding and professional -- they immediately rectified the situation by refunding our money and providing us with credit toward a future stay. Unfortunately for us, the delay (as it was our departure morning) resulted in us missing our flight home, adding a $64 bus trip to our itinerary and encountering a 4 hour delay in our travel plans. As an aside, if you choose to fly out of Santa Rosa Airport, be forewarned that they will close the gate a few minutes early and you will be completely SHUT OUT from your flight! There's only 1 attendant (it's a tiny airport) and when he's gone, you're SOL. We heard later that it's a regular occurance at this airport....shame on Horizon Air!

Stayed just one night and I can definitely see how it could induce some polarity in opinion. It is either barnyard chic or nouveau trailer park and I guess that is in the eye of the beholder. On the one hand, it's an easy location, not as far out as some of the nicer properties in Napa, making it an easy drive from SF. However, the grounds are much less lush than some of the other nicer properties in the Napa Valley. It's a bit spare and reminiscent of, well, a high end trailer park or Agresta (which will only make sense if you watch Weeds.) The use of corrugated metal as the barrier fence between the cottages is brave but also a a bit questionable. It's next to impossible to make any material like that look high end, and at $600 a night, high end is important. Okay, I get the whole \"Farm\" theme, but perhaps some weathered wood might have been a more inviting choice and more fitting for the vibe they are going for? Extremely high marks for the entire experience at their restaurant \"Farm\". The food was excellent and the outdoor dining room exactly what one hopes for on a warm night in Napa. The radiant heated floors in the bathrooms, the indoor/outdoor showers and the rocking chairs on the front porches also are worth mention. Additional shout out to the 24 hour pool and hot tub on the hill top. Nice view, nice touch. Low marks for the general lack of lushness and views from the rooms, the very odd lack of space for setting up the luggage valet even in one of the larger cottages, sparse landscaping, semi-characterless rooms and as mentioned and did I mention the weird use of corrugated metal? Neutral marks for the extreme neutrality of the rooms. They are very comfortable, but as mentioned a bit cramped (even in the larger ones) and also lacking in character. It's hard to love them unless you happen to love things that are completely neutral, which is hard to do by definition. Additional high marks for the spa -- one of the best massages I have ever had.

I reserved a vineyard view cottage - I've gotta have a view. I've got to have my privacy. Admittedly I was there during an \"off\" time (early in the week) and the resort was pretty much empty. The nice man at check in was kind enough to upgrade me to a vineyard view suite which consisted of two connected buildings, one housing the bedroom/gorgeous bath, and the other a living area and full bath which I walked in one time. MONSTROUS deck in the back connecting the two. And oh yes, there was a view. There are over 100 reviews here about how lovely the rooms are and exceptional the service is - yes it's all true. But let me say how the combination of a heated slate floor in the bathroom, sexy outdoor shower and a beautiful sunrise in the morning can be pretty much a religious experience.

They are very busy there. I may have lost my mind. There are some cool amenities to this place that also make it worthy of staying on campus for a weekend and not fret too much about hitting every winery within a five mile radius. I went large for lunch at The Boon Fly Cafe with the burger and it was worth every one of the 5,000 calories I ingested. Two glasses of wine too and I got to walk back to my cottage without the angst of \"should I be driving?\". The swimming pools are both beautiful and vanishing edge.

There's a very nice market place at the entry to the Inn with a well stocked deli counter and monstrous refrigerator case with an impressive wine collection. Nice gift shop also. Cute little post office next door. The Hilltop restaurant was closed when I was there but I didn't care. Between the burger and the treats I scored at the market place, it was more than enough.

I could not have asked for a more lovely place to stay. Check in was very smooth and we were given a glass of wine during the process. From the moment we arrived, the staff was simply exceptional. The grounds are spread out and well landscaped in such a way as it never feels crowded. The decor in the cottage was very modern with clean lines. The best part, without a doubt, is the backyard which allows for complete privacy. We had a table with four chairs and a double sized lounge chair as well as the outdoor shower. We used the heat lamp in the evenings and were very comfortable. I should also say that there are different room set-ups in the garden cottages as our friends' cottage was arranged differently as was their backyard. It seems to me that the better set up is where the bed faces the french doors out onto the backyard. If you are looking for a resort where you are not on top of your neighbors and enjoy outdoor space- this is definitely the place for you. As I stated before, the staff was great. The concierge services were professional and friendly. Prior to arriving they had made arrangments for us to go on Playtpus Tours one day and for a driver from Napa Valley Tours on the second day where we had appointments at mostly smaller wineries and were provided with a very personal experience. I would recommend both highly. The first night we returned to the room to find a complimentary bottle of wine and a nice note in celebration of our anniversary. A nice touch. The breakfasts at Hilltop were excellent as was the view from the outdoor dining. One morning I had asked for a wake-up call but having awakened early, we left for breakfast before the scheduled time. When we arrived back to the room, someone knocked on the door just to make sure everything was okay since we hadn't answered the phone. Another evening, ice was delivered to the room in less than five minutes of calling. Boon Fly was good for dinner.

We got a very good price on their garden cottage (a quiet Superbowl Sunday in winter) and then were upgraded to a Vineyard suite, which was a lovely gesture and much appreciated. A true mark of a 5 star hotel. The service was excellent, as good as any 4 Seasons, though with a casual California style. Our room was heaven, especially the bathrooms, with the heated slate floors and all the natural light. And the patio, too, was wonderful...even though we stayed on a January day, the weather was sunny and in the 60's, and we used the patio in the evening and morning thanks to an outside heater. Our vineyard view was soothing and bucolic. Don't know if I'll ever be able to return, but would love to, and the Carneros Inn is on my list of the best hotels I've ever visited.

I don't say this often, but I don't think that I would ever stay anywhere else in this area in the future. Admittedly among the most expensive accommodations in the Napa area, but there's definitely a reason for that. The service was not bad, although I wouldn't say that it was of 5 star hotel quality. It was more of a friendly, helpful nature than a refined, anticipate your needs and meet them nature. The grounds are truly gorgeous, from the common gathering areas, to the pools, to the vineyards, to the restaurants. Among the best facilities that you will ever find. The cottage was not spacious but very cozy. The bed was nice, not too soft, as many luxury hotel beds are for my taste. The bathroom was outstanding, with our favorite feature being the outdoor shower. What a unique, memorable touch. The private back patio was a great place to spend some quiet time. Overall, I simply have to say that this is one of the best places to simply relax that I have ever stayed at. Now for some comments about dining, since I would consider that mandatory for a Wine Country review. We had dinner at Redd on Friday, lunch at The French Laundry on Saturday, dinner at Tra Vigne on Saturday, breakfast at the hotel's Hilltop Restaurant on Sunday before leaving. Redd in Yountville was outstanding. One Michelin star, well deserved. Good value for the area for fine dining. Excellent foie gras trio as an appetizer. Both the beef and the duck cooked beautifully. The desserts were outstanding, the chocolate peanut butter gianduja and the Thai coffee panna cotta. The French Laundry in Yountville was very good, although it's hard to meet or exceed the hype. Service was good, as expected. We all had the chef's tasting menu, noone had the vegetarian tasting menu. I would say that the best dishes were the duck, the foie gras, the striped bass. The bread from Bouchon bakery was outstanding. The dessert was good, not necessarily out of this world. The petit fours plus chocolates was a nice touch. All in all, a very good meal, worth the trip once at least, particularly given the fact that the cost is relatively reasonable for a three Michelin star restaurant. That being said, I have definitively had better meals at three star restaurants in Paris as well as at Gordon Ramsay in London. Tra Vigne in St. Helena was a surprising find. We didn't think that we would like what we had for dinner after the 4 hour lunch at French Laundry, but we were surprised. Casual, relatively inexpensive, completely different from the pomp and circumstance of French Laundry. Creative, tasty pasta dishes, nice shortribs, very nice pizza.

The resort is very true to its locale in design & ambiance. The employees are well-trained, provide polished service, & are genuinely happy & personable - Four Seasons level or better. 0% snobbery. 100% R&R. We were there the Christmas week, leaving before Christmas. Then returned for a shorter stay the following week. This is the low season for Napa Valley \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very low. I had initially planned a spring trip, but decided to take a chance on winter. We all absolutely loved how quiet & private it felt. It never felt dead boring quiet, because the restaurants & public areas are well trafficked by locals & other visitors. RESORT LAYOUT - The cottages are spread across the resort in various unique configurations (clusters of cottages, each cluster is assigned a name such as Larsen/Ceja/Bartolucci/etc). Each cluster has its own parking area, so it's very easy to fetch your car. There's no valet. You just walk a short number of steps from your cottage to your car. - The detailed resort map is available on its web site (www.thecarnerosinn.com > click on Photos > click on Virtual Tours). Very well done. It shows all the cottages, with their cluster name & #. - Although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spread on 27 acres, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a short walk to get anywhere. And the way the whole place is laid out makes you want to walk, and meander about by taking different paths to get to/from a destination. However, if you don't want to walk, simply call the bell desk & you'll be picked up at your cottage & taken by courtesy car/golf cart to your desired destination. - The Vineyard Walk path (I call it the 'backway' to the Hilltop area) is very dimly lit at night. Because it has some steps, it's an ankle twist/fall waiting to happen if you're not careful. - True, this place is a little south of the heart of the valley. But I consider that a blessing -- it's a freestanding haven (not like, say, Yountville where you can see a hotel every block). Downtown Napa is an easy 10min trip, Yountville 15-20, etc. THE COTTAGES - Fabulous, as any photo of the cottages make obvious. - Beds are soft in that feather bed sort of way. I like very firm bed, so the beds weren't the greatest for me, but they did the job. The problem w/ feather beds is they can be heavenly when new, but develop a concave in the center when they get old. - For the standard cottages, Ceja #2, 3, & 4 offer the most privacy (from what I saw) - King cottage Larsen #4. A lot of light into the cottage & patio all day long. It's also an end unit. Only down side is water takes about 5 minutes to get really hot. - Double-Double cottage Mahoney #6. Not a lot of light into the cottage in the morning. The patio is big, really nice. Right outside the front door is a lawn, good if you have kids/dogs. - Double-Double cottage Lee #7. The patio is small. The beds have started to concave. It was ok, but I wouldn't stay there again. PET FRIENDLY - A lot of people take their dogs to the Apple Orchard. Parents can sit & chat on the benches while the children & dogs run around the big grassy expanse. SPA - This is the tiniest hotel spa I've ever seen. 18 lockers total, 2 showers, 2 toilets, 2 sinks. This is no problem in low season, but can you imagine what happens during the busy months when 90% of the time the resort is at capacity? - The lounge area is co-ed. It's nice to be able to relax pre-/post-treatment with your spouse in an oversized sofa lounger. The steam room & sauna are segregated, but you can always meet up with your spouse at the Hilltop Jacuzzi which is directly outside the spa (sorry, you can't see the sunset from the Jacuzzi). BTW, the Jacuzzi is heated to 101deg, which is perfect -- most Jacuzzi are set to 105/higher which is too hot. The pools are heated year round, set to 82deg in winter. - Between the 4 of us, we had 3 massages, 2 hair & scalp treatments, & 3 facials. We rated them from OK to very good. Massages all very good. The quality of the facial & what is done is dependent on the therapist. My sister's 1st Mini-Chardonnay facial was excellent (result: super hydrated, soft, smooth, dewy), but the 2nd one just ok (soft, dewy); the 1st therapist used scrubs to exfoliate, whereas the 2nd therapist used acid peel. - In-room massage is a good choice if you simply want to roll off the massage table & onto your bed. Otherwise, just go to the spa. The in-spa massage tables are the best & most comfortable I've seen; and the masseuse will be able to do heating packs for you that's not possible in the in-room setup. - Book your spa treatments early, otherwise it could be slim picking. FITNESS CENTER - Nicely equipped, but not a true gym. It looks to me to be ~ 900sq ft. - Plenty of cardio machines, all with direct view of the lap pool. - Not a lot of weight machines, but enough to work out all your main muscle groups. RESTAURANTS - All 3 restaurants do fine jobs for what they're trying to be. - The Boon Fly donuts are indeed worthy of its fame. Although we had it 3 times, every time very good, but only 1st time was perfection. - The huevo ranchero (they call it 'crispy tortilla and farm eggs') @ the Hilltop restaurant for breakfast is very good. - The seared scallop in meyer lemon broth (foam of broth, really) @ the Farm is so simple, but so very good. - If you like bread & butter, the Farm uses the tastiest butter. But we didn't ask them what brand of butter.", "Date": "December 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cBest time Ever!\u201d", "Author": "Rikki13", "ReviewID": "UR22928817", "Content": "Our stay at The Carneros Inn was wonderful.

Very stroller friendly; great staff; little kiddie pool our kid loved which is not more than 18 inches deep. Our vineyard suite was really pretty and picture postcard perfect from the little picture windows in our bathroom and outdoor shower. Sitting in a hammock at the hilltop pool at night you see a full sky of stars, something I see rarely. Feed apples to the horses that border the property and see cows in the meadow. Pick apples and figs on the trees. Farm fine dining restsaurant is excellent but it only has one fish on the menu and not conducive to return visits if you are a fish eater and want some choice. The outdoor area outside Farm is a great place to chill; have a guitar and flute player there on weekends when we visited. The Market is excellent as a grocery. A few things could use improvement: Food at Hilltop and Boonfly Cafe comes out slow and breakfast at Hilltop is uninspired; a real problem with little children. After a few days, they figured out they needed to get stuff on the table for the kids more quickly to avoid meltdowns and trashing the place. Concierge sent us off to an attraction which was closed that day of week and didn't tell us to take care to arrive at another attraction in time for it to close. Didn't say sorry either. Sent us to a restaurant for fish without calling to find out if they had it on the menu (they didn't, but we lucked out with a fish special that night). But she was very friendly and tried to please; more a function that they don't have many kid visitors.

Hotel has a great line of blood orange-flavored toiletry products; we liked them enough that we bought some (something I've never otherwise done). Hilltop tends to have weddings going on almost daily on the property and this does interfere a bit with the poolside.

The property is fantastic with beautiful grounds, fruit trees, lots of water fountains in stainless steel tanks. Views of the vineyards. We enjoyed walking around the property. Even though it is a big place the layout of the cottages let you walk around and feel you are staying in a much smaller place. While we were there the apple trees had lots of fruit. During a morning walk one of the ladies who worked there offered a fig from one of the trees. It was sweet and tasty. We ate in all of the restaurants. FARM was elegant but not pretentious with great food. We waited in the outdoor lounge which had a great fire pit. The restaurant was open and airy. We also made our way to the Boon Fly Cafe. Friends had told us they had a great hamburger. Instead we had the daily special, fried chicken (we usually don't eat chicken in restaurants since we eat it at home so much), it was fantastic. The Market had a great selection of wine, cheese, sandwiches, salads, and other gourmet treats. After our morning walk we'd stop of a latte. There were lots of choices depending on what you're in the mood for. We used the gym. Very nice. The doors open to the family pool. Lots of air and the feel of being outside while working on the treadmill to work off all that wine and gourmet food. They even had the cutest little adirondack for the kids. Lots of towels around. We were offered bottled water at the pool. Everything is very well maintained. The staff was great. The valet staff provided cold water or soda when you drove up. (Temperatures were in the high 90s while we were there.) Check in/check out were flawless. We also got great advise on wineries and restaurants. The best advise when we were on the hunt for a good italian restaurant came from one of the valets who sent us to Don Giovanni, an excellent italian place in Napa. While the property is expensive, we thought it was worth the cost. I only have two complaints. First, the turn into the property comes up on you suddenly so plan ahead. Second, the lounge chair in the room looked good but didn't do much as a chair. It turned out not to be a problem since we had two chaise lounges and a table with chairs on the back deck and two great rockers in the front.", "Date": "September 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "tampa florida", "Title": "\u201cNot worth the price\u201d", "Author": "bell88", "ReviewID": "UR19777221", "Content": "Spent sometime in Napa with my husband on a short get-away weekend.

The patios also have heaters, which work very well during the chilly evenings and early mornings. Also loved the outdoor showers. Service was excellent overall. The only glitch was with the concierge desk - though they were nice enough, they incorrectly entered the time for one of our vineyard visits, and also didn't make follow-up calls for some other activities. The problems are correctable - seems like a management matter, perhaps too many people trying to do one job (I think we spoke with at least four different folks regarding plans). In any event, they did pick up the tab for the tasting at the rescheduled vineyard visit, which was the right thing to do. The \"adult\" pool area is the best spot at the resort - it sits atop a hill with fantastic views of a meadow, vineyard and mountains, with occasional horses and cows meandering about on the other side of the fence. Truly, it was difficult to leave - we actually spent some evenings enjoying the sunsets and having dinner and/or appetizers outside. The nearby outdoor fireplace is also a terriffic spot for an evening nightcap. Poolside service was excellent.

They staff were all very friendly and went out of their way to do stuff for our daughter. She loved getting rides on the golf carts. She was at Otto's pool every day and had a blast. They have lots of toys for the wee ones. We had a private spa (hot tub) with the suite that the adults used every night before bed. Most of us were sick with colds on the trip so it really helped us relax at the end of the night looking up at the stars. Such a wonderful addition to the suite. The spa was fabulous. They went out their way to accommodate our requests. They even gave me a patch made of essential oils to help with my congestion from the cold. The treatments were heavenly and just what we needed! The products are so yummy. The beds were super comfy with lovely linens an the room was always filled with Frette cozy towels. They had the fridge stocked at all times with bottled water. Turn down service gave you Cocoa Bon mints every night. The bathrooms were filled with Red Flower products in Blood Orange. Mmmmm so nice. The only thing that bugged us were the TVs. They were hard to get working at first and very confusing at the best of times! Not a big deal, but definitely an issue! Make sure you have a chat with Paul up at the Hilltop restaurant.

It was so peaceful it seemed as if we practically had the property to ourselves; however, there was a large wedding party and most of the rooms were booked. There is a fireplace in your room if you want to sleep by the fire. There is a large plasma t.v. over the fireplace if you need one.?? The back wall is french doors on to a private patio with your own table and chairs with an umbrella. There were a couple lounge chairs for sunbathing and a 10 foot fence all the way around so you can sunbathe in anything (or nothing!) The bathroom has heated slate floors so you don't get cold feet in the morning. There is a large bathtub with a separate shower that has a back door in it so you can step outside and have an outdoor shower!

I found Tory Burch half off and a really cute swimsuit. The pool area is very relaxing. They have servers to bring you lunch and frosty adult beverages (if you choose) and the area overlooks the vinyards and where they keep their horses. I highly recommend The Carneros Inn!

A classic example of gross over-promising and under delivering. The check -in experience feels like a luxury property, but the wheels fall off very badly once you see the accomodations. To be fair, we didn't bother staying even a night of our planned 3 day stay. We left after a dinner at the Farm restaurant, and found a delightful place in Sonoma, 10 minutes away. We have stayed at about a half dozen $600++ a night properties over the past year so we're pretty dialed into what one expects at this sort of a price point. Upon arrival, you will drive through what looks like a trailer park on the way up to the Check-in area. If it doesn't remind you of a trailer park, it might remind you of PMQ's on a military base. Look very carefully, because chances are, you will be staying in the guest \"cottages\" that are crammed into the trailer park - like setting. After talking to locals, we are told, but can't confirm that this area was orginally zoned for mobile homes, thus the reason for the layout. Other locals thought it was going to be low income homes for migrant workers. Either way, the common response from folks around here when mentioning that we'd stayed there was initially a perplexed look, followed by a knowing grin, then a sly smile that said, \"sucker\"... Views? Are you kidding? Your front door will be looking out towards another 4-6 \"cottages\" - umm....trailers.... across a slightly landscaped courtyard. The good views (that you are led to believe are lovely on-line) are reserved for the as yet unbuilt \"cottages\" that they are selling...yep....this isn't a hotel, this is a real estate play. Your little private yard will have a scenic view of the board and batten of the next \"cottage\" , or if you are lucky, the corrugated tin siding used for screening. The landscaping is well done, but not mature. The interiors are quite nice, but very cramped. The TV / DVD players are not matched, so unless you are handy with these sorts of things, you will most likely be stymied. The internet, both via ethernet and wireless was so slow, it was effectively useless. You will need it if you do what we did and pull the pin and need to find another place on line. Best go up to the check - in area and do your search up there. I've never been in a $600+ a night hotel room, let alone a \"cottage\" where there is absolutely no space to place your baggage. We had to put ours on the bathroom floors, and the most obvious place to leave the bags was on the exterior patio. There was no room, other than for one bag in the closet. Want a swim? I don't mind a walk, but it's a hike up to the trophy swimming pool, and I'm not going to do it in shoulder season when it's barely 60 / 16c outdoors. It looks great in the brochure, but I suspect the folks in \"steerage\" won't be using it much. It's probably there as a selling feature for the as yet unbuilt cottages, being sold on a fractional basis. The staff are very pleasant and try hard, but they simply don't have the tools, infrastructure and accomodations to do the job. They quickly agreed to refund the deposits etc for our stay. We got the distinct impression this was not the first time this has happened. As for The Farm restaurant, the food was good, (albeit small portions), and the wine was not chilled to the proper temperature, which was surprising given this is wine country. In short, be very, very careful when booking this property. What you see online is NOT what you will experience when you arrive. After checking in, we had to call the main desk to see if meals were included because there was absolutely no value based upon the nightly price point pushing $700. It is $200 a night property. Nothing more, nothing less. We've read the reviews and they are clearly for a property in an alternate universe, or written by folks with little travel experience and are wowed by the prospects of a little \"cottage\" with, gosh darned it, heated floors.....or folks trying hard to impress a new girlfriend.

The Carneros Inn is an architectural jewel, cleverly designed to echo a Napa Valley farm yet surprisingly luxurious. Our garden cottage was immaculate and filled with quality sheets, towels, and other fine details. The staff was uniformly cheerful and solicitous of our every desire. I must admit that we maximized our limited time at the Inn --- taking full advantage of a gorgeous fall day to bike to 2 wineries along near- traffic free back roads right near the Inn, swimming twice in the Hilltop pool, my wife's having a body scrub and a massage and I taking a yoga class for something novel, and eating at all 3 restaurants, enjoying each one's smart design and distinctive menu. Yes, this place is expensive, but I cannot think of a better value. Somewhere in the Inn's literature is the statement that \"the land inspires.\" Well, basking in the hilltop pool's hot tub, with a glass of chardonnay in hand, and gazing out across the rolling hills and the autumn-colored vineyards, all bathed in that soft late afternoon light, toward a mountain range etched against a clear sky ---- I totally agree.

Cons: housekeeping was very bad - every single lampshade was covered with about 3 years of dust, curtains were stained and spotted, desk chair was stained on the seat, there is no permanent off switch for the porch light that shines into the room (even when they explained that we could turn it off, it is on an automatic timer and turned itself back on after an hour), hardwood floors were so filthy that our socks vere black, pillows on the bed are not down but foam (ick), there is no basic storage to stow your suitcase or clothes for that matter as there is one tiny cabinet so plan to not unpack, slippers they give you are made of straw and incredibly uncomfortable and room service food is expensive, not so great and they forget things on your order. There were extra charges on our bill when we checked out but they very nicely removed them without argument.

Didn't really matter as we brought our slippers and house slippers are also provided. The rooms are very comfortable and have everything you need. Flat screen TV, nice comfortable bed, great linens, apples were left in room, dvd player, and fireplace. I really liked the fact that Internet jacks are provided indoors and outdoors at no charge. I think the best part of the room is the outdoor shower and the heated patio area. Spent a lot of time using both of these! The location in the Carneros region is great. Since it's in the southern area of Napa, it is about 45 minutes to get to the city of S.F. for sightseeing. You can also get to Sonoma, Marin, Novato, Oakland, Vallejo, and Berekely very easily. Yet you are still not very far from all the wineries and restaurants up north. The food at the Farm and Boon Fly is excellent. Didn't try room service. The deli/gift shop is excellent to pick up snacks and drinks. The A-! market/liquor store just off the property is also a great place to pick up drinks and snack items.

We found the service and hospitality well above average, the food good and the facilities extremely well kept. It is obvious, however, that this is a young property and the foliage and trees are not typical of a veteran Napa property. Within 10 years or so, it will be magnificent since they have planted fruit trees, vines and the like throughout. We also got the feeling that there was quite a bit of vacant rooms.

We had read all the reviews before we went and didn't understand the negative comments. My advice is to not book a hotel until you check it out on tripadvisor.com so you know what to expect! Anyway, we arrived about forty-five minutes before check-in and our room was not ready. Everyone was very nice and we waited in the lobby drinking champagne and reading the newspaper. When our room was ready, an attendant on a golf cart escorted our car to our cabin. Inside, he showed us around the cabin and showed us where everything was and how it worked. Within an hour, the hotel was bringing us complimentary wine for our first anniversary. We spent most of the day in our robes on the comfortable bed in front of the fire watching television. That night, we walked to the Boon Fly Cafe for dinner. The place was a lot smaller than it looked from the outside, but the food was good. The next day, we called ahead and my husband walked to the Boon Fly Cafe to pick up breakfast--Boon Fly donuts and yummy fruit. We walked around the grounds that day. Even though it was cold, everything was beautiful and clear. I loved the glass \"fire pit\" near Farm. We had \"cottage dining\" for lunch outside underneath the heat lamp. It was expensive (an 18% service charge), but good--ahi tuna salad with butternut squash soup. That night, we went to Farm for dinner. While the decor was beautiful, the food was just average. Since I don't eat meat, my food selection was limited, but I had a wonderful beet salad and homemade fettucine. The next morning, we had more \"cottage dining\" for breakfast. This time, they set up a table inside. Both times we ordered room sercvice, the food came within twenty minutes and the attendants were very nice. I would definitely recommend this place for a \"get away\" weekend. We would have liked to get massages, but their spa prices were too high for us. While we didn't pay for our room, I would definitely stay here again, but not pay full price. Is it worth $450 a night? Probably not.

We were greeted at check-in with champagne, with very proficient and professional staff. Always smiling and greeting you by your last name. The concierge was exceptionally delightful to speak to and she was always looking to make my wife and my 8 year old son feel comfortable. There is an actual farm and winery across the reception lobby (minus the smell from the animals) with simple but attractive landscaping throughout. Each cottage has modern d\u00c3\u00a9cor without being too cold. Hardwood floors in the bedroom and heated tiles in the bathroom, with indoor 3 headed shower connected to the outdoor shower make this cottage a unique feel. The concept is similar to that of the Sanctuary in Scottsdale except they have a soaking tub outside instead of the outdoor shower. The heated patio deck is spacious but some will find the actual bedroom a little too small. Counter space is abundant but closet space is limited. The mattress is comfortable but the pillows need to be lower in my opinion. You can rent complimentary DVD from the reception and they have a good library. You have to try their new restaurant, the Farm (reviewed separately) and also the Boon Fly Caf\u00c3\u00a9 (the donuts are delicious).

Every cabin has its own porch to enjoy the views and a sizeable private backyard. The backyard has a patio set and heaters so you can enjoy it at all times. We really enjoyed eating breakfast there. The cabins themselves we thought were beautiful. Loved the size, decor, and of course the bathroom! It really felt private. Also, like the other reviews mentioned ask for a cabin with a side entrance...a much better layout. We really enjoyed our dinner at the Hilltop restaurant.

We've spent a lot of time in Napa and know the wineries well -- we just wanted an opportunity to stay someplace unique, private and luxurious. We were not disappointed. From the outset we were pleased. We called Carneros on a Saturday and were hoping for a one-night stay (contrary to the two-day stay minimum). Given it was Saturday, noon, they were quite willing to accomodate us. We drove up to Napa and spent the afternoon on the Silverado Trail, finally making our way over to Carneros around 5:00 p.m. We were initially a little put-off by the construction (where do we go? is this really it?), but once we negotiated the road to the top of the hill and made it to reception, we were very pleased. The property has a terrific view of the southern end of Napa Valley and the surrounding hills. It is very picturesque (aside from the neighboring farm and yard-junk). From the pool area, you have a gorgeous view nicely complimented by cocktails. The rooms were terrific. Really quite stunning.

The bed was terrific and we were able to plug our iPod into the stereo and enjoy our own music both from bed and the patio. We didn't bother with dinner on the property and brought in some great cheese, bread and salads from Dean & Deluca in the valley along with a bottle of wine we bought at V. Sattui. This was really enjoyable to eat on our private patio with the stereo blaring. Great food, good wine on our own private patio. Perfect. But it was the outdoor shower that really sold us on the place. The indoor shower has a door to the outside that allows you to open it and create an indoor/outdoor wet room with a rain shower head on the outside and multiple jets on the inside. We spent a lot of time enjoying both -- feeling only a little guilty about abusing the property's water supply. The service was very casual.

It's either a modern marvel or a gravel-pathed trailer park. You really ought to take a look at pictures of the place before you book here... because it IS one of the most unique places I've had the pleasure of staying at. Here are some random observations from our stay (two nights), in no particular order of significance: 1. It is a considerable distance away from the heart of Napa Valley. We didn't find it inconvenient, but folks who want to be right in the thick of it all would be better off booking in Yountville or St. Helena. We actually enjoyed the relative seclusion... especially since we were in the valley over a weekend. It has more of a 'resort-unto-itself' type of a feel. 2. The construction at the entrance is still going on, and while a sign out front says that the project will be complete in 'Summer 2006', it certainly appears that there will be work going on well after that. This was not a problem for us, though - it seemed like crews had the weekend off. On Monday morning, the day we left, we woke up to sounds of a construction truck backing up, and there were workers all over the place. We were in the 'Knittel' cottages near the center of the property. 3. The rooms are gorgeous. The outdoor space is gorgeous, too - our cottage had a deck with 2 chaise lounges and a 5 piece outdoor dining set. The heated bathroom floors were really neat. The 3-head indoor shower looked great - but I never used it. I fell in love with the al fresco shower, which is attached. I was in that thing every chance I got. The shampoo/soap/bath products were wonderful as well. My only knock on the rooms: storage space. It was great to have two leather chairs and a sitting area, but there was no way to use them - there was nowhere else to put our bags. It seems like a major oversight to me that in such a great space, there is such little... space. There was a note in the room from the general manager, apologizing for the construction. Part of the project, according to that note, is to 'improve the functionality of our current cottages'. I can only hope that he's talking about the storage situation. 4. Our experience with housekeeping service was pretty spotty. Details such as a fresh bag of coffee were not seen to. There was water on the floor - from a recent mopping, I presume - when we returned to our room. Turndown, on the other hand, was excellent. 5. I had the best massage of my life at the Spa. The therapist's name was Christina. 6. The pool and jacuzzi area are magnificent. Open 24 hours. Jacuzzi + 1/2 bottle of champagne + full moon = a night I'll never forget. And there are a number of horses that live right next door. Very cool to see them grazing and running around while taking a dip in the 'edgeless' pool. 7. Breakfast at the Boon Fly Cafe is not to be missed. If you can roll out of bed and go down there, it's worth it - there are more interesting items on the menu than on the room service menu.

She is very knowledgeable about the area and made some fantastic reservations for dinner and wine tastings. She did mention that there was some construction, but it stops on the wknds. We arrived on Fri 11/11 in the afternoon and we did notice the apparent expansion. You will find some of the roads are gravel, however if you can look past this, it is like getting through the desert to find an oasis! Upon checking in, we were delighted to find out that Cadillac was offering the free use of their new SRX Suv for the entire day. The valet was nice enough to drop the Suv to our room and showed us the amenities in the room. When my wife walked into the cottage, I knew I had picked the right place...she was smiling from ear to ear! The cottage is the ultimate in high technology meets California rustic chic! From the plasma TV and DVD player, thermostat controlled heated bathroom floors, indoor/ outdoor showers, to the outdoor patio with overhead heater. The list goes on and on!! Awaiting our arrival was a nice package from Siobhan detailing our reservations/points of interests and maps. We spent Fri checking out some local wineries and grabbed some dinner at Rutherford Grill. On returning to our room, there was chilled champagne! WOW!! Saturday, we had breakfast at the Hilltop dining room and enjoyed the extraordinary view of the mountains, the changing colors of the vines and the steam rising from the heated pool. The heated pool and Jacuzzi were open on the wknd. Siobhan had made reservations at a winery named Del Dotto (which was a romantic dream) and also checked out another recommended winery; Regusci - awesome winery! We had reservations Auberge du Soleil which started at 4:30 watching the spectacular sunset and eating dinner on the balcony! Sunday, I checked out the outdoor shower...nothing like being able to look up and see the sky--priceless! Had tea on our private patio and also started off the morning with the most relaxing therapeutic massages. We then had lunch at Hilltop again, outside this time. By the time we knew it, it was time to leave our hideaway cottage.

I made reservations on-line, when I called back with a Priceline deal-- they were very accomodating in adjusting the rate. We drove and it was a hard place to find.

There were also no mirrors in the room, except the bathroom-- it was hard for all of us to get ready. The outdoor fireplaces near the lobby were great--very cozy and crackling! Regarding the SPA, the website is confusing and the reps were unclear about treatment schedules and locations and mixed up the treatments that were booked by me and my sisters. I was excited about the Garden Scrub --grape seeds, fruit pulp and other ingredients, but it was a lackluster experience and I found it disappointing for a 4-star Spa. Sadly, our original lunch plans at well-known Buchon were cancelled due to a fire. The hotel concierge were not helpful in arranging other plans.

This place is contemporary and high-tech. There are lovely grasses instead of colorful flowers, gravel pathways instead of concrete, gorgeous Brazilian wood floors instead of carpeting or tile, and corrugated metal patio walls instead of stone or brick. The rooms are beautiful and luxurious, very comfy beds. It's true, not a lot of storage. Just two drawers at the foot of the bed, plus a closet. Big bathroom, separate tub and indoor/outdoor shower. The individual cottages are grouped together around little courtyards, and each has a private patio and a little front deck with rocking chairs. I'm here with a group of 5 rooms, so I saw all of them. The rooms are pretty much the same, but the backyards vary greatly - some much larger than others, some have views.

We selected this place over Meadowood, which is a zoo in my opinion, and over the new Auberge in Calistoga.

One important thing: because of the construction going on here, they are offering very discounted rates. We're paying half what we would have paid at Meadowood or Auberge. But I would only stay here in rooms at the top of the hill. The ones down below do look like trailers, and are too close to the road, at any price.

The wonderful amenities included the fireplace (replenished with a \"burlap\" sack to burn each day), the heated floors, plasma TV, wonderful blood orange spa products, candles, the outdoor shower, overhead heater on the deck, teak dining table and chairs, a bowl of Granny Smith apples, robes, nightly turn down service with a sachet and bottled water. I could go on an on. There were nice little touches as well such as room service delivery your food in big huge wicker baskets, rocking chairs on the front porch, a galvanized steel mailbox with USA Today every morning or the San Francisco Chronicle on Sunday, also on the front porch. Lemon-basil water by the pool. Being able to pick a lime or fig from the orchards. We found the accomodations quite comfortable and well-appointed, think Restoration Hardware or Pottery Barn. It took everything to get me out of bed in the morning because it was just so comfy with all the pillows and nice linens. Gorgeous Brazilian mahogany floors. We took so many baths and showers on this trip. We loved how the indoor shower opened up to the outdoor one. You can also turn on four different shower heads at the same time. There was also a Cuisinart coffee maker with tea and coffee as well as bottled water (Carneros water is very mineral rich and tastes weird), DVD player (free DVD's and board games in the main building), a mini bar fridge but I managed to fit some things in there as well. Wine glasses, cork screw, ice bucket were provided as well but you must call for ice since there are no vending or ice machines. Free Internet access. There was a closet but a definite lack of storage space so we didn't unpack. We know some guests have been critical of the external appearance of the units, but we found this unique and interesting. And it mimics Wine Country. The bell hops will drive you around the property on golf carts if you need a ride. Room service was very fast, 10-15 minutes for breakfast; 20 minutes for dinner. One negative, there was some confusion about what type of breakfast for two was included with our package. Better knowledge among the staff would alleviate this. Prices were not bad for room service; there is an 18 percent service charge and 7.75 percent sales tax added. We used the heated pool area only twice but it was satisfactory. It measures approximately 18 feet by 75 feet. There were always people using the pool and whirlpool. The outdoor whirlpool was a bit small. No problems getting chaises, chairs or towels. We took our own bottle of wine and enjoyed the views. I did see servers taking orders from other guests for bar service. We didn't use the spa facilities so we cannot comment on that. There is a lot of construction going on right now. Hopefully, the vineyard views will improve. Definately ask if your cottage is near any of the construction. They are building 20 one and two-bedroom cottages, a fitness center, yoga building, another lap pool, a children's pool, Jacuzzi, conference center with meeting facilities, a Carneros post office, town center, retail space and a new 100-seat restaurant. They are also upgrading the gardens and public areas as well as addressing the functionality of the current cottages. At check out, they offer you bottled water. Also, upon completing the trip, we were also contacted by the assistant to the general manager Paul Horner, regarding our stay, just making sure everything went well. It would be nice if the resort would lower their prices but we don't think that is going to happen.

When you book, ask for a cottage close to the Hilltop restaurant/Lobby. That way, you can walk to the pool. I booked the cottage on their parent website and got a discount over what was on the Inn website. Once you check in, you have totally privacy. The little cottages are small, but very swank--fireplace (they bring you wood in a burlap bag that you just light), flat screen tv, a private patio with its own \"overhead\" heater that heats your patio so you can have a drink at night or breakfast in the morning), heated bathroom floors, a shower with multiple jets and an exterior door so you can choose to take a hot shower outdoors. Very, very upscale and most all the guests were in hip in attitude and an affluent 30-40's age group. The pool setting is spectacular. It overlooks a vineyard--just breathtaking. There are two restaurants--The Hilltop which is for guests only. Service is SLOW! They serve B,L, & D. At the entrance, there's the Boon Fly Cafe. With pretty much the same breakfast menu, the Boon Fly is faster and they serve their signature homemade donuts. I'm still working those off! The only downsides was their workout facility is under construction and they only have three machines--treadmill, elliptical, & stairmaster. Good quality machines, but not many. The machines are housed in an empty cottage. The other downside is that once you leave in the morning to go to vineyards, its not like you can pop back in for a quick rest. The Inn is located at the bottom of the valley. It really didn't bother us because we had full winery days planned and then we had an early dinner before returning to the Inn. As for dinner, Mustards Grill was great as was the Martini House. The Inn recommended La Toque where they have a prix fixed menu w/wine pairings. It was the worst meal we had the entire trip--the food was not fresh at all--and it was one of the more expensive, about $450-500. I would not recommend it! Make sure you make appointments at your favorite wineries. I was a little concerned that we would get to these small wineries and we would feel pressured to purchase wines that we really didn't like, but that was not the case at all. No pressure at any of them! We went to Swanson, Opus One, Shafer & Far Niente. There were between 8-12 people in each of our groups. Swanso was cool because they served food with their different wines. It was a great trip and if you get to spend a night or two in San Francisco, it makes for a great trip.

The only thing I was worried about before checking in was whether the staff would be pretentious, which is a huge turn off. They weren't at all, but rather were extremely friendly and bent over backwards to try to do whatever they could to make our stay the best possible. While we didn't get upgraded to the Lee Suite like one reviewer (that would have been a definite plus), we had a \"hamburger\" garden cottage in the interior. Hamburger means that the door is in the middle; hotdog means that the door is on the end. That should pretty much sum up that while the place is extremely nice, there is no attitude whatsoever. The only negative about the cottage was the nonexistant view. It would have been nice to have one of the vineyard views, but whatever, the cottage itself was great. One reviewer said that if he hadn't have been upgraded to the suite, he would have felt cramped. Wow. You must stay in some huge hotel rooms when you travel. I guess if you expect the cottage to have a living area other than the outside deck and garden, you may be dissapointed, but the cottage isn't lacking in size by any means. The bathroom is fantastic, and the shower is by far my favorite shower ever. It has four showerheads that are all adjustable and you can open the door that leads to the \"al fresco\" shower outside. If you open the door 90 degrees, it locks into the al fresco shower to create about a 12-15 foot shower stall, half inside and half outside. Pretty sweet. I think I took the longest shower of my life. The plasma TV w/ DVD and VCR were also great, and the fireplace was a nice touch, though the \"firewood\" (it's not real wood, but rather a pile of firestarter logs I think) only lasted for about 15 minutes before it went out. We might have done something wrong, I don't know. The staff are fantastic...really, really friendly and also very knowledgeable of the surrounding wineries. I would recommend taking a trip up to Alexander Valley and the Russian River areas of Sonoma.

I read all the Trip Advisor reviews - and reading the details from contributors really paid off! Because we read the reviews, we gathered that paying the extra amount for a Vineyard View room would not be worth it, so we booked a Garden Cottage for $435 for a Saturday night. I booked it on-line in November. A few weeks later when I checked the web-site, a weekend stay for that weekend had a 2 night minimum - which was not what we wanted, so I felt fortunate that I had booked far ahead. I read the review entitled \"Best Trip Ever\", written on 12/30/04. Towards the end of the review the writer stated \"Get a cottage with a king bed and the entry door in the \"middle\", not on the end...trust me. Better layout by far and feels larger.\" I wasn't sure what that meant but I trusted her, and asked the front desk upon check-in what exactly this reviewer was referring to. Samantha, at the front desk, knew exactly what this was and why this may have been mentioned (though she certainly did not disparage the units with doors not in the middle - she said it was simply personal preference by some). She checked to see which layout we were slotted for, and we indeed were set to be put into the type of room with the layout the writer did not recommend. When Samantha saw that she said, \"Let's see what we can do for you that may be better - I think we can give you a suite.\" Not only did they give us a suite - but apparently the best suite in the hotel according to where it is located, and according to the opinions of many staff members! It was Rooms 9 & 10, Lee section. Room 10 is the sleeping room, and Room 9 is the entertainment area. They are separate buildings laid out end by side in a L-shape pattern, with the very large private deck connecting the two. The outdoor patio has a gate that opens onto the edge of the vineyard and you could wander out - and apparently this room has the best view of the vineyards as it is sloping downward. What was also nice was to have 2 fireplaces, and also 2 bathrooms and 4 showers!! (2 indoor and 2 outdoor). We had our computer with us and checked the Carneros web-site and saw that this suite goes for $1000/night! We had friends driving over from Santa Rosa to meet us for dinner at the Hilltop, so this set-up worked out fantastic! We spent and hour and a half having wine at the suite - enjoying the beautiful view on our deck (outdoor heaters are wonderful when the sun sets), and then into the entertainment room to share a platter of hor' doeuvres in front of the lovely fire to continue our festivities before dinner. Carneros - you truly made our trip special with treatment like this! A resort will do this obviously upon occasion for PR purposes - and I will pay them back by letting Trip Advisor readers know of their generosity! We had lunch at the Boon Fly before check-in which was quite nice, and we had dinner at the Hilltop. The food was fantastic at the Hilltop! There are 3,4 & 5 course prix fix meals to choose from. We thought it was very reasonably priced for $50 for a 3 course dinner - especially considering you could pick whatever 3 courses you wanted!! For example, I didn't want an traditional appetizer - and I was torn between wanting the Monkfish and the lamb for my entree. The solution was simple. Choose 2 main courses! The Monkfish is apparently one of their specialities, and it almost tasted like lobster! Just wonderful as was the lamb! Prior reviews of Carneros showed controversy in opinion of the appearance of this stylized hotel. The cottages are meant to be reminiscent of the vineyard worker's homes of past. It is very different. And I don't know if I would have been happy in a room that was on the interior of the grounds. (Check the grounds map before you accept your room). We decided that we appreciated what they were doing stylistically - but it is different. I have given this resort a 4-rating, but my 5's are reserved for only the best spots in the world - and we do travel well and frequently. My criticism would be that the cottages are very small - too small for my taste. If we had not had a suite, I would have felt very crowded with only the sleeping room. I will not repeat all the praise already given the hotel on the wonderful room amenities, and will only say I agree. Give Carneros a try.

The cottages are warm and inviting, and the views of the vineyards are wonderful. There are many cottages, my experience is the DiRosa 1 cottage has the best view. The beds are lush, the flat screen a treat for the men (plus you can rent for free any movie they have in their collection for as long as you want), the fireplace is wood burning, the outdoor patio with heater is wonderful, and the shower with all of the heads? Heavenly. Tips: we brought along a small portable sound system and a few edibles with us which turned out to be perfect, we could store the edibles in the refridgerator. Also, be ready to request from them an extra round of wood for the fireplace as it burns very quickly and one round is not enough for a night. Also book your spa treatments before you arrive. The grounds are rustic and you truly feel connected with the outdoors. The smells of the rosemary and gardens and vineyards is in the air. The hot tub facing the vineyards up by the pool is heavenly! The Boon Fly was delicious for dinner (and casual) and the Hill Top for breakfast is easy to get to with wonderful views. (Try the green eggs and ham-yum!) The food is so incredibly fresh. The spa is the best part, however. It was the best facial my husband and I have ever had-ask for Marcia. Also, my massage was ranked right up there-ask for Sherrie. The spa is located very close to many fantastic wineries, and the consierge lead us in the right direction with VIP tasting passes to boot. Don't forget to visit Artesa Winery, the best views in Napa. I recommend autumn in Napa, it is gorgeous with the colors! We will definitely go back to this resort. The only down side is I agree with some of the previous reviews that mention the staff is \"young and unpolished\". That does not go for all of them, but you can tell it is a new resort and they are still ironing out some kinks. Make sure if you have a package, for instance, that you inquire upon check in on all of the treatments and items you should be receiving. But I think the fact that the resort is only 1 year old allows a little room for polishing. Regardless, the privacy and amenities were more then worth it for us. This is a true secret that is quickly circulating through many travel magazines and even the tabloids, as many celebrities are attracted to it.

Simply put, this property is outstanding. I've read the reviews posted here before we went and since we've been back and am honestly astounded at the criticism levied against the inn. Agreed, the architecture takes some getting used to, and the vineyard cottages are a bit view challenged, but the overall feel is so unique and luxurious that I am honestly hard pressed to identify a better property that offered so much. I suppose being in a cottage far away from the pool area could be disappointing (we were adjacent), but other than that this place is the perfect escape. The rooms were the ultimate in self indulgent luxury. The beds, the plasma television, the bathroom, and of course the shower are as good a framework for relaxation as you are going to find. I suppose one could complain that it was difficult to hear the ocean. Our experience with the conceirge was more than adequate. I would just view it as more of a country inn with friendly staff, than a major metropolitan 5 star. The most difficult part of our stay was deciding where to hang out. The pool, the room, the spa and private courtyard were each idyllic in their own ways. It would have been very easy to ignore the wineries and never leave the property during the day. We loved the breakfast by the pool, and the prix fix dinner in the guests only hilltop dining room added an additional sense of exclusivity. To summarize, if you want a generic property with shared walls and a view out of the end of the room then the Carneros Inn is not for you.

Seems like an easy enough statement to live up to but in the case of the Carneros Inn - if you wanted an unobstructed view of the vineywards you weren't going to get it unless you stood on stilts to look over the tin fence that surrounded your patio. Driving into the property, my husband and I had a sinking feeling when we saw the \"stockade fencing' on either side of the driveway. Why would they block the view of these beautifuly 'cottages' and vineyards? Leaving the main fencing behind, we drove into the complex of huts - surrounded by their OWN tin fencing. Fencing at least 6' high. As other people have mentioned, the patios are certainly private. I am only thankful that we were there in October rather than in the dead of summer when those fences would prevent any breeze to enter and any air that was inside would be so hot from the reflection of the tin. My main complaint - we paid top dollar for a Vineyard View Cottage. We've stayed at other places where we've been situated right in the middle of a vineyard. Or, we've walked onto our balcony/patio and have a complete unobstructed view of a vineyard. Those places were private and delivered what they advertised - all without putting us in a hut with tin fencing around it. I noticed that the pictures on CI website have been changed from what we saw when we made our reservations. Those pictures showed a view from inside a cottage looking outside to the vineyards. Obviously those were taken before all the fences were erected. Would we go back - no! Remember - vineyard view room .... where I couldn't see the vineyard as I sat on my patio or anywhere from my room. I could only see a small slice of the vineyard if I went out on the front porch and looked to the right down an alley. Other cottages, that weren't priced as Vineyard View had the same view as we did - they just had to look further down the alley. Yes, the rooms were ok. But calstraphobic because you had to keep the blinds down for privacy. And looking out any window that wasn't closed up would only let you look at a tin fence. Shudder. The only reason we didn't change our reservations to another place was because after I indicated how unhappy we were with our room we were told there was another available. Room 10 Lee Section. This is the best vv cottage. The patio overlooked the vineyards (the fence was still 6' high but the lay of the land was slanting downhill and we were able to actually lay in bed and see the sun rise and vineyards. That was luck on our part. If you go, make sure you get this room if you want vineyard view. Otherwise just get a hut, hunker down behind your tin barricades and hope for cool weather and find yourself shaking your head for not paying attention to this review. The staff seemed inexperienced. It didn't seem that they were very well trained and there didn't seem to be a main person in charge. When we inquired about their making appointments at vineyards that required appointments - they gave us the phone numbers so we could make the calls. Staff coming in and out of the main reception area never made eye contact, said hello or acknowledged any of their guests. Again, inadequate training. All in all, the only thing that saved the visit was Cottage 10, but even with that - we wouldn't go back.

Yes, it does have different architecture than what many people are used to but that was the vision when it was built. Call me crazy but I think their originality adds to their charm. The majority of the other inns/hotels in the area all look the same and although offer really nice accommodations, they all appear to be relatively standard. Rooms at Carneros are definitely not standard and its so nice to have your own cottage (no worries about how loud your neighbors are)! For the most part, the service we experienced was great. Christy (Concierge) was fabulous! She got us into some wonderful restaurants and let us know that one of the wineries we had hoped to visit required reservations. She was very proactive and ensured everything was taken care of prior to our arrival. The service we received at the Spa was also incredible and the massages ranked right up there with the best we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had. The only poor service we had came from one individual and was by no means indicative of the overall service we received.

I completely agree with the reviewer from Plano, Texas, who said that the product was good but the service was a problem. It's not that the service is bad, only that it's wildly inconsistent. One of the waiters at the poolside restaurant was fantastic, but the front desk when we checked in was hopeless. There is room service, but we became so skeptical about the staff's competence that we never tried it. Management needs to train their staff to operate at a consistent level. Right now, it's left to the individual staff member -- if they're smart and on the ball, you get great service; if they're witless (and we came across more than one of these), you're out of luck. As for the \"product\" -- the cottages are outstanding, everything done to a high standard. I'm not an expert on these things, but the finishes and materials struck me as expensive. The tin fences and walls that some reviewers complained about are actually an interesting choice; according to the brochure, they're meant to echo the traditional workers' buildings of the past. The pool was the highlight. It was so beautiful out there that we spent one day doing nothing but lounging on the deck, reading. It's glorious. (I did notice, though, that some of the hardscaping and steps were already chipped and cracked. Not a good sign for such a new hotel.) In conclusion -- go! There are problems, but the beauty of the surroundings, and the great cottages, more than make up for it.

Yes the plasmas and DVD was a nice touch, but the real treat is the bathrooms. Like your own spa. Heated floors, indoor showers that felt like a car wash, outdoor showers that felt amazingly refreshing.

They kept telling us that they \"were almost full\" and at dinner on friday they said they \"had a few spaces left\", and it seemed that they were at about half capacity and only 3 tables were being used in the restaurant during our dinner. It's tough for their business but great right now if you are a guest because obviously word hasn't gotten around yet about them, and as a result, you get the place to yourself. I would definitely recommend it and will hopefully return...very convenient location for going to wineries and for dinner in Sonoma, and the entire concept of the place is really different.", "Date": "May 5, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "san francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cMy kind of place\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1849803", "Content": "Just returned from three nights at Carneros Inn and it made me cry to leave. The weather was unusually hot but the breeze and champage by the spectacular infinity pool made it all just right. Loved the cottages with the plasma TV's and huge bathrooms. The big soaking tub was great but nothing compared to the outdoor shower which was the best. Service was friendly and attentive and seemed to have a true desire to please. I've stayed at all the traditional places in the valley, and this one (at almost half the price of the big names) has won my heart -- and so close to the city compared to trekking all the way up the napa valley. Hit the local wineries pretty hard so decided to try the restaurant and it was tasty and as good of a meal as we've ever had -- actually went back for our third night as well. try stone masssage as it made me melt. on the down side, hard to find the turnoff and entrance is still a bit rough as is first view of cottage roofs but once you get through the gate and settle in, it's a great place to kick back.", "Date": "April 30, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cNot up to par yet\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1770043", "Content": "Great concept, wonderful rooms -- especially the private patio w/heater and the roman-style shower -- friendly staff, but lacking the experience and professionalism expected in this type of property. The SPA is incredibly overpriced for the services. I continue to feel that I was ripped off. The mani-pedi station was an afterthought and far from relaxing because of location, uncomfortable seating position and the location next to a busy office. The technician was inexperienced as well (but friendly!). The massage however was professionally executed, albeit the thin walls in the room in which sounds from the hallways and other rooms were heard. The staff, again friendly, but not experienced and seemed a bit confused about some of the services offered. The meal service was also lacking in experience -- with no waiters to be found at some times and inexperience in timing the meal (starters and entrees served almost simultaneously). The food was good but not excellent as expected from the prices. For the same price, visit Bernardus in the Carmel Valley. Same luxury-group, but superior property. With time perhaps this property will shine.", "Date": "April 8, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Carneros Inn", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32766-d281284-Reviews-The_Carneros_Inn-Napa_Napa_Valley_California.html", "Price": "$400 - $745*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4048 Sonoma Hwy.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Napa</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">94559</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "281284", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/21/10/41/hilltop-pool-at-the-carneros.jpg"}}
