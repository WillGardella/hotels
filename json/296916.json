We had the triple room on the corner of the 3rd floor. It was clean and attractive, and the king-size bed was very comfortable (fold-out bed less so, but perfectly fine for a fold-out bed). The hotel is located within a block of one Metro station and within 2-3 blocks of another, with different lines serving them, so that was convenient. It was mostly pretty quiet except for the recycling/trash pick-up early in the mornings outside, but that bothered me very little; I noticed it but it wasn't terribly loud. My only wishes are that it had had a coffee/tea pot in the room (although there are Starbucks and caf\u00e9s within 2 blocks) and that the lighting/electrical system had been more convenient. There were some lights that had several switches around the room, some that I never could find out how to work them, and the alarm clock (programmed via what looked like a light switch on the wall next to the bed) went off unexpectedly on our first night there.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chevy Chase, MD", "Title": "\u201cLocation and More\u201d", "Author": "CCSusan", "ReviewID": "UR128304197", "Content": "The reviews about the location are all true.

We had an on-the- street-side room on the 6th floor. The hotel was clean, comfortable, stylish, and very quiet, with easy-to use, in-room, free wi-fi. We heard occasional people one evening, but we slept well. The street-noise was present, but didn't bother us much. A lighter-sleeper may prefer a room off the street (traffic, street sweepers, 2am-ers, etc could sometimes be heard). The room lighting was excellent; the climate control defaults to 'off', so I'd have to remember to turn it back on; it took a phone call to the desk to figure out how to access the additional cable channels to get BBC (the desk was very nice about it). There is a free in-room safe, and the bed was 2 twins pushed together, which was comfortable and apparently typical. I would have loved to have a facecloth included in the linens. The rooftop solarium and pool were open on the nice days - great views! Also, when you are learning your way around, you can see the edge of the solarium on the roofline from down the street, to help find the hotel. We were not impressed by the continental breakfast - mediocre offerings at a high cost (11 Euros). There are several fabulous little local cafes about a block up the street, heading toward Pl. de Catalunya, on Ronda de Sant Pere. The ambiance, bustle, and great food are worth leaving the hotel for your first cup of coffee. The service at Hotel Jazz was very good. I heard the staff speak Spanish, English, Catalan, and German. They patiently answered my tourist questions, gave directions, fetched hot water for me to bring back to my room for a quiet cup of tea, and loaned umbrellas on rainy days. The location was perfect for our needs. We had a very short (half-block walk) from the Aerobus stop (the shuttle bus from the airport - get off at Universitat, but walk up to Pl. Catalunya to pick it up back to the airport). In addition, the nearest Metro stop was also at Universitat, and La Rambla was just down the street. Very easy starting point to all things Barcelona. The price was a little steeper than we typically like to pay (ok, who REALLY wants to pay anything??), but the overall quality of the hotel, the superb location, and the excellent service made this a very good value.

Nice roof deck with a plunge pool Free wi-fi \u00b7 They provide an assortment of in room amenities such as dental kit, comb, etc. Note though, as typical for many European hotels \u2013 there was shampoo provided but no conditioner. \u00b7 There were a few minor negatives: \u00b7 The heat/AC control in the room was initially difficult to figure out \u00b7 TV reception was poor for English speaking channels. \u00b7 I though the lobby was very sterile compared to other hotels in this chain. \u00b7 There was free wi-fi but you had to sign on almost every time you used it; I found this to be annoying. Probably the biggest plus of the hotel is the location for first-time visitors: It was a five minute walk to Las Ramblas, and probably no more than ten minutes to the Gothic quarter; a ten minutes walk to Passeig de Gravis and 25 minute walk to the Magic Fountain. If you are a good walker, and stay at the Hotel Jazz, your use of public transportation and/or cabs should be minimal.

Here are the low-downs you'll want to know: 1. Doesnt get much more central than this - a stroll to pretty much anywhere decent! Most other reviewers are right when they say, this is a great location, it really is, and so easy to get to using the Aerobus from the airport (5 euros approx one way). 2. Close to Pl Cataluyna metro stop which is one of the metro stops which many lines cross 3. Its clean, its smart, it's modern and has everything you need (aside from an Iron - got to say we were surprised at that!). If you want to iron something, either take a travel iron with you, or use their ironing service - it's your only option! There is no iron in the hotel that they can give you. Btw, the bed we had was MASSIVE. Ask for a double bed - we even lost each other during the night sometimes, lol! The bed is also extremely comfortable. 4. Ask for a room higher up, you will get much less traffic noise. We had a room on the top floor and noise was no problem - we even slept with the windows open most nights (as rooms can get warm). Yes, you here the metro rumble past sometimes, even on the top floor, but this is no issue at all. To be honest, its a nice feeling to know your in a vibrant city. 4. All the staff we encountered were very pleasant and not one of them rude (which from what we've seen/read, can sometimes be a problem in Barca) 5. The servive was very good - room service was especially good and prompt. We pretty much used it every day for a quick breakfast fix!

I would strongly recommend to anyone booking at this hotel to avoid rooms on the second floor ( where I was located) to avoid this problem, alternatively, Management should note this point and fit rubber/felt pads to chairs as a matter of urgency to prevent further criticism in the future.

Had in-room safe, nice bathroom and it was very attractive. The staff was very helpful and the hotel really cares from prior correspondence before arrival and followup. The location is great for a tourist and convenient to the metro and airport bus (note--you get off at placa Universitat upon arrival, but for departure, you cannot get on the Airport bus there, you must go to placa Catalunya, don't know why). It's only about a block to the hotel from the airport bus stop. There are lots of good restaurants just north on rambla de Catalunya and that area. My only negatives about this hotel are that there are no English channels on the TV. This seems odd for a hotel trying to be an international business hotel and most hotels in a city this size in Europe have some alternatives (nothing was on but Spanish, I would take English or French). If you never watch TV, that wouldn't matter, but I like to relax and watch news or something at end of day. Some other review said they had English channels but they didn't when I was there as I checked every channel several times. Also, the electricity completely went out in half my room the last night I stayed. I didn't do anything, I was just in bed watching TV and one circuit (which included the bathroom and half the bedroom lights) just went out for no reason.

Found it to be fairly quiet and a convenient walk to Las Ramblas & the metro. It was a little pricey but the room was HUGE!!! Largest room we've ever had anywhere. Son (14) who usually complains about being put on a sleep sofa was content to be in his own space (although he couldn't see the TV which was on the master bed side of the wall). The \"master\" beds were hard as rocks tho so we didn't sleep as well as we would've liked. (We have a \"Select Comfort\" bed at home so often have a hard time sleeping on regular mattresses.) The one thing that caught us off guard that I hadn't read about was the rumbling from the metro which runs under the property. Every 4 or 5 minutes we could hear the trains go by - they weren't loud, but they were noticable & unexpected (we were on the 5th floor). We found it to be clean, modern & well furnished. Our interaction with the staff was all pleasant. They offer a computer off the reception area where you can check-in online for your flights & print your boarding passes which was nice. We did not eat at the hotel so can't really comment on their restaurant. I gave it 2 stars only because I walked thru 1 morning to look over their breakfast offerings & thought it was very overpriced for what was being offered so we went down the block & found a cafe around the corner with a decent breakfast menu for a lot less. We visited the pool both afternoons after touring around the city & Montserrat and found it refreshing, although a tad crowded (not enough loungers). It seemed most of the other guests had the same plan as us to chill by the pool for a bit every day. There did not seem to be many children staying at this property so our son (14) felt a little awkward I think, especially with a couple of topless sunbathers taking center stage by the pool (hard to get used to that European sunbathing I guess). We had spent 1 night in Barcelona pre-cruise at another property and decided by our 3rd day in Barcelona that we just weren't in love with the food that we'd had in general. We had hit & miss experiences with different tapas & paella and our son had 1 very nasty hamburger somewhere (not even sure it was beef) so on our last evening we decided to go to the Hard Rock Cafe down at Placa Catalunya and that ended up being our best meal in Barcelona!! We went around 8:00 and only had to wait about 10 or 15 minutes to be seated. We were very pleased with that decision and would recommend that as a dining option as it's a very short walk from the hotel. So yes, we would recommend the Hotel Jazz to others and yes, we would stay there again.

Not far from the main tourist areas and next to metro stations. Very good resturants surround this property. Also the bus from the airport drops off a few hundred yards away. It is a 3 star contemporary designed hotel. As far as service is concerned it is spotty. The staff is young. Some are eager to help and others could care less. Don't expect much of a welcome upon arrival or a thank you when departing. If you need help with your luggage they don't provide it. Some might like the design but it was for me quite sterile and cold. Some nights the halls were barely lit. They use tiny recessed bulbs. They offer free internet service. Two pc's are available for guests. But most of the time I was there (3 nights) the one pc was inoperable. I noticed water stains in the ceiling of the bathroom of my room when I checked in. Later that night I heard dripping. Since it was over the tub I waited until the next day and told the front desk. No one came to look at the leak or fix it. The next day the leak became a steady stream of water. At 11 pm I went to the front desk again, this time the front desk clerk came to my room to see. She offered to move me which I accepted. Had to pack everything up, she couldn't help me because she was the only one on duty. What should one make of this? I believe that this hotel at one time was a good place to stay, but something happened - the economy maybe but a hotel that knows it has a plumbing problem and doesn't address it has staffing or financial issues. If you look closely you can also notice other issues. Such as the curtains have got to be the orginals. This hotel simply is not being maintained properly. I had an early departure flight, it was still dark at around 6 am and just out front of the hotel where taxis pull up were several clearly intoxicated persons lying on the ground. The hotel security man was out there watching them, I don't understand why he didn't call the police to have them removed. Over the years I have stayed in a number of good value hotels due to TA reviews but a few times I have been disppointed as well. Sometimes a general consensus begins to form about a certain hotel and the conventional wisdom is not accurate. This hotel is ok if you get a good rate, compare the rate to other 3 stars. And if the room is not a critical part of your vacation. In other words the hotel doesn't matter that much. But if you think you're getting a value I would say you might be disappointed. I would have given Jazz 3 stars but with the leak a 2 was a generous rating. I still had a wonderful time in Barcelona.

There are 2 Starbucks about two minutes away, as well as other restaurants and grocery stores. Others have mentioned hearing the rumbling of the subway. The only place I ever felt the rumbling was on the ground floor. Our room was on the 6th floor (there are 7 floors), and I didn't really notice the subway.

Firstly, Location (& transfers) The hotel is situated perfectly as is just set away from Las Ramblas yet is within a 5 minute stroll which on route you will find many places to snack or shop. Jazz is within 15 mins of the airport and so i imagine a taxi would be cheap, however, you would be foolish not to take the airport (AEROBUS). this costs EUR5.30 pp and you need to get off at th 3rd stop (Universitat). For clarity, you should exit the airport through the main doors and walk to the left where you will see the bus. the return trip is just as easy but you catch the bus in the square at the top of las ramblas. Just a note, get off the bus walk straight (road towards la ramblas) and keep looking left, you will see the hotel on a little side street.... 2 mins from the bus stop Amenities. The pool is small, but you are in a City! the rooftop pool isa great extra where you can chill, lunch, drink or soak. it tends to be quiet so i wouldnt recommend a large group of kids, although it definately caters for them. Most visitors are on business i'd guess. The hotel has a large breakfast area, small jazz room (bar with internet) and a rooftop bar. all prices are reasonable. the brekkie seems pricey but apparently nice, cant comment though as we ate out alot. Rooms are great size and pretty upmarket, you get the feel you're in one of the better hotels in the vacinity! outside is very loud, but honestly with the balcony door shut, you cant hear a thing, we stayed on floor 4 it was perfect! Links Hoetls jazz is close to plenty of bars and restaraunts and is round the corner from a tour bus stop. This costs EUR23 for one day, so we got a 2 day one for EUR30 and used one day to tour and visit nou camp and gaudi sites, and the other day to take a diff route and get to the beach. very little at all to fault, strong 9/10", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel, great location!\u201d", "Author": "Clusk86", "ReviewID": "UR115313615", "Content": "My girlfriend & I stayed in the Hotel Jazz at the start of this month for two nights.

The room was clean, and spacious. My only complaints were that the bathroom is badly designed. I can see the look that they are trying for, but I need real lighting in a bathroom, and real shower doors. I wondered why there was a drain in the bathroom floor, and it's because it was near impossible to shower in either the tub or shower stall without soaking the floor. There needs to be better lighting and an exhaust fan. The lack of these was an issue that if I were staying for more than a few days would have been a real issue for me. The rooftop bar and pool were great, and the location was excellent for us. Close enough to everything! The only other complaint is the business center does not have a printer. So you can print your boarding passes. The hotel offers to rpint them for you if you email the document, but you have to know how to convery it to a pdf first?

Before I begin, let me say that I am not a really picky person unless things start to pile up and annoy me. A hotel room for us is mostly a place to sleep a few hours, shower and get OUT for the day/night. We were in Barcelona for our 25th wedding anniversary, so I selected a hotel that I thought would be a little 'special' to celebrate. I'll start with the GOOD: The rooftop pool. Without this pool, this property would have only gotten 2 stars/bubbles (if that) from me. The pool is wonderful, with food and beverage service available (mojitos!!). The only downside is that they close this area off at 10:00pm; there were several nights when it would have been nice to sit up on the roof, have a drink and look at the lights of Barcelona. The BAD: Things are just a little weird, as though they were reluctant to pay for repairs; we had track lights that were flickering for three days before they were replaced, the slider to the non existent patio did not lock, the end cap that held the toilet paper on the holder was missing (which caused the roll to come flying off every time you used a few sheets of the sandpaper-like paper). The cable TV worked fine the first couple of days, but after that, we only got a handful of stations and no longer got BBC. The a/c did not work the first night we were there, but, in fairness, they DID fix that the next day as soon as I told them about it.. Then there were the things that were just poorly designed. The hotel LOOKS great, but trying to put on make-up in the (black) bathroom was laughable. The makeup mirror was positioned in an unlit area, so I was never QUITE sure where the mascara was ending up. The cord on the blow dryer was too short to be able to see yourself in the mirror while you dried your hair. The a/c seemed to have two settings; permafrost or sweat lodge. Worst of all, the tub was really slippy; you took your life in your hands every time you got out of the shower. We had some trouble getting toiletries replenished and had no bar soap for two days (they were very thorough about taking away the leftover soap though; too thorough). Plus, it took a note to the housekeeping staff and TWO subsequent phone calls to get a couple of extra pillows. The UGLY: One day, after being out for hours in the hot sun, we decided to head back to the hotel for some 'pool time'. We walked through the doors at the same time as a couple of young women from Holland. We all walked through the door with sunglasses on. As we took our first steps, we ALL started skidding across the floor towards some stairs at 100mph in different directions. The (black) marble-y floor was wet and soapy, but we couldn't see that walking in from the bright sunlight with sunglasses on. There were NO signs warning of 'wet floor' and the men doing the actually mopping were on the other side of the room. It was a miracle that none of us actually fell; my life flashed before my eyes more than once in those split seconds. Once we all came to a stop, I looked around to see if I'd missed a 'wet floor sign'; I hadn't. I went kind of ballistic, yelling at the mopping guys, \"WHERE IS THE SIGN??\". They couldn't have cared less and actually seemed annoyed with US for walking on their wet floor! The front desk staff seemed surprisingly unconcerned as well. It really annoyed me and at that moment, I decided I needed to write a review.... Did I have a wonderful time in Barcelona? Absolutely! Did I love the roof top pool and whoever made the cocktails? Yes and yes! Would I consider staying here again? Not likely. For the price, I think we (and you) can do better.

The receptionist rang housekeeping and we were told our room would be ready in 20 mins if we'd like to leave our bags. We decided to wait and within 10mins we were told our room was ready, very impressed. On using the in room safe there was an error, as i don't think it had been reset from the last person, but we contacted reception and they were there in 5 mins to sort it, very efficient. Our room was on the 4th floor, very spacious, modern and clean. The bathroom offered a free handy kit of everything you could possibly have forgotten. The bed was very comfortable and there was plenty of wardrobe space. The only real problem with the hotel position is the loud rumbling noise of the metro that runs directly beneath. This could be heard regularly and runs from 5am - 12am (and until 2am on weekends). It sounded like a big rumble of thunder every 15mins or so. Although a bit of a nuisance it didn't actually disrupt my sleep and reading other reviews it may be best to request a room on a higher floor if you're a light sleeper. I wouldn't let it put you off. We enjoyed drinks in the hotel bar one evening, great service and relaxed ambience. The only reservation was that the bar shuts at 11pm which was a tad early for us. A breakfast buffet was included in our stay and was typically european, plenty of choice (although i prefer an english breakfast myself) I'm sure the meats, cheeses, fruit and cakes will suit many pallets. There was one staff member who did not speak much english and therefore seemed to avoid us rather than offering us tea and coffee. The hotel is in a fantastic location just a couple of minutes walk from the top of La Rambla and Plaza de Catalunya where the bus tours start from. The hotel offers free wi-fi which was great and a free bag storage service after check out. The hotel has a great roof terrace with plenty of seating, great views of the city and a pool, although it was too cold to use. I would highly recommend this hotel. Travel tip: From Barcelona airport take the train to Passeig de Gracia, switch onto the metro, purple line one stop to Universitat and the hotel is just round the corner. Get a T10 ticket which gives you 10 journeys and can be shared. Beware of lifts in the metro/train station as we caught some low-lifes with their hands in our bags!!", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic value for money\u201d", "Author": "Paula76035", "ReviewID": "UR106180062", "Content": "Jazz Hotel was a hit with its minimal modern decor, location and great breakfat.

My only gripe about the bathroom was that the water leaked from the shower onto the floor really easily but that's just a minor complaint. Although we didn't use the rooftop pool it looked lovely and the terraced area was a great spot for catching the sun. We got breakfast as part of the deal which was fine - ham, cheese, bolied eggs, sausages, fruit, pastries, yoghurts and cereals. You could also ask for a generous amount of scrambled eggs or an omelette, made to order. The hotel's location was fantastic, pretty much walking distance from most of the must-see areas. As mentioned many times the metro is just metres away and the airport stops at Univerisat (about 100m away from the hotel).

This one issue could make or break your stay and I strongly advise you consider these comments before you book as there are many better places to stay in Barcelona in equally nice locations. On the positive side the hotel is clean and modern, our suite was comfortable, the housekeeper was terrific (and so nice, something lacking at this hotel), and the location is good. On the other hand, with just a few exceptions the front desk staff is for the most part rude, uninterested in helping you, uninformative, and indifferent. In all my years of travelling internationally and throughout the US, I can\u2019t imagine anyone at any hotel, whether a Four Seasons or a Hilton, speaking to a guest and treating them the way one particular front desk woman treated us (she checked us in around noon and seems to work midday and is nasty beyond description). It was just unbelievable to the point where we even spent part of our first day looking at other hotels as we couldn\u2019t imagine staying at a place like this. The entire check-in process was a bad experience. There were three of us travelling (including my 15 year old daughter and my mother who\u2019s in her mid-70s). We were dropped off in front and after 20 hours of travel and with 8 days worth of luggage, noticing we had to lug our belongings down some stairs to the front desk, you would think at least SOMEONE would have gotten up off their chairs and offered to help, or at minimum say hello and welcome. There were 3 clerks (the nasty woman and 2 guys) just sitting there watching us. After I made it down with my bags I asked if there was a bellman or someone to assist my mother and the front desk woman snapped \"This is a 3 star hotel, we don't offer that service!\" Wow, okay, I didn\u2019t know that but I also wasn\u2019t expected to be scolded. You\u2019d think at least one of the 2 guys could have been a gentleman and earned a tip. We were never greeted with a hello, welcome to Barcelona, how was your flight \u2013 something would have been nice. She barely made eye contact. The indifference she showed us was just shocking. And we couldn\u2019t have been more polite to her! After finishing the paperwork I asked for a map and a few suggestions as to where we could walk around that afternoon. Again, this woman continued to be downright nasty to the point where I finally had to ask if there was something bothering her as we couldn\u2019t quite figure out why she was so mean to us. Did she hate Americans? Did she not like women? We were dumbfounded. All we did was check in and ask for some suggestions and we couldn\u2019t have been nicer. When we got to our room we found that the phones weren\u2019t working (and they repeatedly broke during our stay). The first few times we had to call the front desk about the problem they actually seemed annoyed with us. The bathroom had a hair dryer that barely blew air so I called the front desk to find out if they perhaps had another dryer they could send up and wouldn\u2019t you know it, I got the nasty woman who snapped \u201cI have one here but if you want it you need to come downstairs and get it yourself or you\u2019ll have to wait 10 minutes because I\u2019M BUSY\u201d. I cannot imagine in my wildest dreams any hotel staffer anywhere speaking to a hotel guest that way! A couple of times we asked other staffers for dinner suggestions. A few suggestions were good, but one clerk who was super nice was clearly inexperienced as she sent us to a place that was barely a step above a pizza hut. We had much better luck finding things on our own. I just don\u2019t think many of the Jazz staff have the knowledge and experience to offer valuable suggestions and/or act in the capacity of a concierge. Another staffer gave us incorrect information about where to meet our tour bus and how to handle payments. Bottom line, if you want a full service hotel with a proper concierge (or other services like a bellman, full service restaurant) this is NOT the place for you. We should have payed a little more and stayed at the Meridien, which looked absolutely lovely and in hindsight would have been the better option.

We were pleasantly surprised to find that the room was so spacious - previous hotels we've stayed at in cities have been much smaller. The room was very clean, modern and we had a huge king sized bed. The minibar was well stocked, although we only had 1 drink out of it on the last night - we preferred to buy drinks etc from a supermarket and keep them chilled in the fridge as this was cheaper. The bathroom was a good size, very clean and had complimentary toiletries etc. It was lovely to come back to a very welcoming room after a long day of sightseeing. The hotel is in a perfect location being just a 5 minute walk up to Placa Catalunya where there are huge department stores and the Hard Rock Cafe is also located there. Las Ramblas begins just off Placa Catalunya which is a lovely stroll past all the stalls and leads down to the Marina. We caught the Aerobus from the airport and got off at Placa Universitat, walked up the street for 1 minute, crossed over the road and onto Carrer de Pelai and to our amazement, Hotel Jazz was right in front of us - we couldn't believe how close the drop off point was to the hotel! We would highly recommend the use of the Aerobus as it was only 5.50 euros each (compared to taxi fare of about 50 euros) and because of how easy it is to use. On our return journey, the Aerobus picks up from Placa Catalunya (not Placa Universitat) which is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel. See website http://www.barcelona-tourist-guide.com/en/airport/transport/barcelona-airport-aerobus.html for more details on Aerobus.

It was pretty near faultless and we would recommend it. We got the Aerobus from the airport to the hotel. It costs 5.05 euros, takes about 25 minutes, and it\u2019s easy to know when you\u2019ve arrived at your stop (Universitat). From the bus stop to the hotel is five minutes walk Among these reviews there have been some negative comments about the staff but we found them helpful and eager to please. It helps considerably that they all speak good English. We were on the fourth floor. The rooms was a good size and in a good state of repair, as was the bathroom. We had a window and balcony overlooking Carrer de Pelai which is a busy street but with the window closed there was no noise to disturb us. Throughout our stay we slept well, the beds were comfortable and the blackout curtains effective. The hotel is warm and we turned off the heating and didn\u2019t get cold. Some reviewers have commented that you can hear the metro running under the hotel. That is true \u2013 particularly late in the evening and early in the morning \u2013 but it certainly wasn\u2019t loud enough to be a problem. If you\u2019re a light sleeper, I\u2019d ask for the seventh floor because I doubt the noise reaches there. If we had one niggle it was that the bedroom doors do not keep out the noise in the corridor very effectively but this wasn\u2019t a serious issue. One of the reasons we chose the hotel was the existence of the free wifi service which we took full advantage of. The connection was quick and dependable. Having a safe in the room was a real bonus and it just about took our laptop (15.6 inches screen). We looked in on the bar but never used it. And we never ate at the hotel. Each room has a fridge stocked with food and drink. We didn\u2019t use that either but the prices looked reasonable for a hotel. We visited the roof terrace. There are plenty of sun loungers and umbrellas, shower facilities and a bar that opens in summer. The pool is about 8m by 4m and only about 1.5m deep. It was November and so no one was using it. Good views over Barcelona. Where this hotel really scores is its location. You are very close to many of the sights and a short walk from the stops for the Barcelona Tourist Bus. We took the Aerobus back to the airport from Placa de Catalunya (five minutes walk from the hotel). Different Aerobuses stop at different terminals so make sure you get on the right one. We got on theA2, were dropped at Terminal B only to find we wanted Terminal C (Easyjet), ten minutes walk away. Lucky we were in good time.

I stayed at the Jazz with my husband after being in Barcelona for 6 days between the U232 and the hotels where we had a great stay. We thought being in the city center will offer a different experience and thought the high price of $250/night was justified. Unfortunately, it was the worst experience ever. Since we arrived to the Jazz, we felt that the staff was not friendly at all. I asked for help with the luggage and the doorman stood still and told me to get the luggage myself. The reception lady informed us that there is a problem with the system and we had to wait for the check in. We stayed in the lobby for 30 min and no one bothered to appologize or offer a cup of water. After checking in, we were disappointed by the relatively small rooms with the only view to the other rooms. It's as if staying inside 4 walls. It was so annoying and we had to keep the curtains closed all the time. The breakfast buffet seemed ok but the food was tasting detergent and there was no one to provide service to the clients. The ultimate was the metro station beneath the hotel... The sensation of vibration as well as the noise were unbearable. You can feel negativity and low level of customer service in every corner of the hotel. To add to our negative experience with the Jazz, our plane was scheduled at 6 am in the morning and we had to be in the airport at 4. Not being able initially to book an extra night, we asked the reception to try to find us any room to stay for couple of hours at night just to freshen up. Her answer was negative without providing any alternative in one of the other hotels in the same chain. So we checked out in the morning, left our luggage in the storage room and left the hotel to come back at 2:30 in the morning. We stayed in the lobby waiting and apparently, we slept while sitting for less than 10 minutes when the night shift manager came shouting and stating that this is not a place to sleep. My husband tried to explain to him that we're simply waiting for the taxi to come at 3:30 and that we were staying in this hotel and we don't accept to be treated that way.

Breakfast is convenient and tasty and enough selections to satisfy anyone I would think. I did find the restaurant/breakfast staff to be a mixed bag in terms of friendliness and professionalism. Some very good, others so-so. Our last morning there was a server we had not seen before, who insisted only a plain omelette could be made and who did not remove used plates from any table until the occupants of the table left the restaurant. In some cases that meant large stacks of dirty plates on an occupied table and this was incomprehensible to me. I did argue that I'd enjoyed a cheese omelette every morning for 4 days only a week earlier and insisted that he ask the kitchen to make one for me, which they did. No idea why he put up such a fuss about it; his attitude bordered on rude, he seemed very unwilling to accommodate even the smallest request, and although he passed our table many times during our 30 minute stay he did not remove a single used plate from our table or any other.

We found the hotel easy to find from Placa de Catalunya which is where the Aerobus drops you off (10 minute walk). The staff are friendly and all speak English, room service which I used twice was prompt (15 mins) and yummy food. Having the sun roof with small swimming pool, with the breeze across the rooftops from the sea with views was was a bonus, especially in August after walking your feet off! There was also a bar serving drinks and food all day if needed. The room was cleaned and toiletries/towells replaced every day and having air con and a TV (Action+ channel showing back to back films in English for the teenager) came in very handy. Barcelona is a great and vibrant city, lots to see and do. I would recommend going on the Las Glonondrinas boat drip (90 minutes trip) out of the marina and along the coast, as well as doing the red and blue bus trips (you don't need to do the green tour as you cover it on the boat trip). You can purchase tickets and get on the bus tours from Placa de Catalunya. We found the Starbucks handy to pop in to (5 mins from the hotel) for a refreshing frappachino (the staff are very friendly), or there is another on Las Ramblas, near to a Carrefour supermarket to purchase small bottles of water for next to nothing to put in the hotel room fridge! Don't forget the indoor food market half-way down Las Ramblas to see the fish, meat, fruit delights, and there is a health bar for smoothie drinks and amazing salads. If you fancy a special Oriental meal, I recommend La Xina on Pintor Fortuny, just off Las Ramblas (on the corner of Hotel Jazzs' sistere hotel 1898. There are also other nice restaurants to choose from on this street including an organic cafe. Try and go off the beaten track and explore the Old Town (Bari Gotic) off Las Ramblas on both sides as there are some great little one off shops and eateries.

Its only two blocks from the Plaza Catalunya. The airport buses have two different stops, both within three blocks from the hotel; so don't pay outrages taxi prices, catch the A1 bus from the airport for only 8.75 euro round trip, and you'll be dropped off almost at the doorstep. We had asked to be given a room when we arrived which we knew would be early in the morning, flying from the states. While they said they couldn't guarantee a room when we arrived (check in is at 3 pm), we arrived at 9:30 and they had a room already for us. The rooms are a nice size for the typical european hotel room. Plenty of room to spread the luggage out around the room, a desk for your laptop, free wifi anywhere in the hotel, and two twin beds pushed together to form a king. The room had a door to a small window overlook, which was enjoyable to leave open in the evenings to allow the breeze in. There is a nice roof-top rotunda, full with a bar that stays open until midnight, and a pool. You can see a majority of the city from the top, and it provides a great place to unwind after walking around the city during the day. We only had two complaints all week long. First, the breakfast food is not the best. We ate at the hotel breakfast buffet the first day - and while it provided plenty of food, it wasn't the best breakfast I've eaten at a hotel. The second day, we had the continental breakfast delivered to the room. Again, it was nice, provided plenty of food, but wasn't the best. Also, both days the price was about 10 euro per person. So, you pay for quantity, not quality. I recommend skipping the hotel breakfast and go find yourself a pasteria or some other local shop if you're a person who's hungry in the morning. Along with the food issue, while there is room service and a restaurant on the premises, there isn't a lot of great food to provide a mid-afternoon snack. The have some sandwiches if you're looking for a light lunch - but it is lacking. The second complaint - and it's not really a complaint - is that the hotel sits on top of a metro stop. So, if you can't ignore noises around you, this might bug you. You can hear, and slightly feel the rumbling of the metro every time is passes underneath. In many ways, this was the only reason we could see why the hotel is only rated with three stars. The best part was the price. For this location and this wonderful of a hotel, you might easily be asked to pay 150-300 euros a night. When we checked out, the price was even cheaper than when I had booked online - less than 90 euros a night. What a deal!

As many have already said, the location for the money can't be better. We asked for a room on the upper floors, and we were accomodated with a room on the 7th floor; I didn't hear the metro once while we were in our room, but my husband did slightly. Some minor things that weren't mentioned in previous reviews that we found helpful: GETTING THERE: From the airport, take the blue A1 airport bus, and get off a Plaza Universitat (cost 5.05 Euro per person). The hotel is less than a minute walk from the square. When getting off the bus, walk in the same direction as the bus was traveling, and cross the street. The hotel entrance is located behind the white building that is located on the corner of the triangular shaped block. While standing in the square, you can see the red facade of the hotel behind the white building, so you'll know in which direction to walk. TOILETRIES: Although there was a good assortment of toilietries in the room, missing were hand lotion and conditioner -- better bring your own. POOL SCENE: It was wonderful to come back to the hotel after a very long and hot day of sightseeing to spend some time in the very warm rooftop pool. Not great for swimming (only 1 meter deep), but perfect for soaking. This seems to be a popular place to congretate during the summer, and were dissapointed to find that when we returned to the hotel on our last day at about 5:00 pm, the pool was full, and there was not a seat to be had. This was a Friday, and I suspect that this is the norm on summer weekends. The weekdays were much less crowded. Also, about every 1/2 hour, a machine on the rooftop makes the noise of a screeching bird -- I suppose to keep some sort of nuisance bird away -- but this could be rather annoying while trying to relax poolside. PICKPOCKETING: We read extensively prior to leaving about all the pickpocketing in Barcelona. Before our trip, we were almost in a state of paranoia about what we might find -- we purchased a money belt, a backpack that has access from only against your back, etc. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the pickpocketing issue was over stated. Yes, you are in a big city, so you must be aware of your surroundings, but we found it no different than being in New York at home. Be cautious, but don't be deterred.

We stayed at the hotel for a long weekend and had timed it to coincide with the Tour De France going through Barcelona. Our first thoughts on arrival at the hotel were how clean and modern it was inside. The check-in was fast and we were in our room before we knew it. I had emailed the hotel prior to our visit asking for a high up quiet room and I was really pleased to see that was exactly what we were given. We were on the top floor below the roof terrace (where the pool was situated) and even had a small balcony which although not big enough to sit on, was lovely to stand on and admire the view. The room itself was spacious and was very modern, clean and nicely furnished. The bathroom was lovely with a nice big bath and shower. Although we looked out over a busy street, we did not hear any noise at all from outside or from other rooms within the hotel. There was the occasional distant rumble from a metro train going underneath the hotel but we didn't mind that at all as it was very faint. Our rate was for room only so we didn't eat at the hotel. We did use the roof top bar though on a couple of occasions and this was lovely. There were plenty of comfy chairs/sofas to sit on and also the added bonus of the swimming pool on the other side away from the bar. The views from the roof top were brilliant and far reaching. The hotel was in the best location right in the centre of Barcelona. We were less than five minutes walk from Las Ramblas and Placa de Catalunya and a two minute walk from the nearest metro stop (Universtat I think it was). There were also loads of places to eat all around the hotel so it was a perfect base. We would definitely go back to Hotel Jazz again and in fact I recommend it to anyone I know who visits Barcelona (a friend has stayed there since and she loved it aswell). It was a lovely hotel in a perfect location. One last thing I would say, and I'm sure you've heard this many times before, is to watch out for your handbags/wallets. We were on our way to Camp Nou and as we were exiting the metro station on the upwards escalator I felt something on my bag (which was a cross the body one which was zipped up but had a flap covering the zipped bit). I realised it was the hand of the man behind me (who's friend was conveniently covering him with a large tourist map). He had his hand under the flap of my bag and was obviously feeling for the zip. I slapped my hand down on my bag and he pulled away then tried to look all innocent when I turned round to confront him. He and his friend then jumped off the escalator and walked away. I was so angry but realised that it could have been much worse for me had my bag not been zipped up. Just keep a hand on your bag/wallet/camera etc when in busy areas such as metro stations or busy streets.", "Date": "June 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "India", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location -- Good Clean rooms\u201d", "Author": "KapoorIndia", "ReviewID": "UR68394634", "Content": "Very Central location.

If you are an ambitious walker, even Port Vell and Barceloneta are walkable (although we metro'd it back!). * Rooms (and bathrooms) were modern, clean, spacious and comfortable (see pictures). Given past reviews we requested to have a room on a higher floor to avoid any metro noise and didn't hear a peep during our stay. Rooms were also larger than typical European hotels so that was a nice touch. * Facilities were amazing! The rooftop pool and bar is an amazing plus. After long days walking around exploring, it was great returning to the hotel and lazing on the rooftop pool deck, drinking fresh made sangria or mojitos and eating tasty thin crust pizza.

It won't appeal to everyone in terms of taste but then what does. We were on the 5th floor and could hear the metro rumbling but it wasn't loud, more like gentle thuder, quite pleasant actually if you're into thunder. Perhaps an issue if you're on lower floors but ear plugs should solve that. Quite good sound-proofing from the street, although you will hear some and sirens etc espeically in the dead of night, but then you're staying in a city centre what did you expect? Sound-proofing through doors not so good, but wouldn't be an issue unless you were unlucky and had rowdy folk passing your room which we didn't. Room was a decent size, bathroom was nice, ok floor gets wet when you shower, no big deal it dries pretty quickly, aircon easy to operate. Bed was very large although was 2 singles pushed together however I could barely feel the join and besides who actually cuddles in their sleep anyway - bugger off you're too hot etc. There are no tea/coffee making facilities as stated by others, for me its an observation not a complaint as I don't care, there's more than enough cafes to go sit in. On that note we didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on the food, I agree and thought 15euro each was a bit much for breakfast. Not that I'm a fan of super chains, but Starbucks is 2 mins away and does a decent coffee with a couple of croissants for 11 euro for 2! add fresh orange juice and you're looking at about 16euro for 2. Again there are local cafes if you don't like starbucks, but it had a good location too with a decent outside area, so I shamefully submitted to the corporate giant. Someone else mentioned that Mcdonalds, Burger King and KFC were all quite clsoe, this is true, but why the hell would you come all the way to Barcelona to eat that crap?? the mind boggles. Others have mentioned that Barcelona is well populated with thieves, whilst we didn;t suffer from this I did see some of the various ploys previously mentioned in action, eg the 'fake tourist' hello I'm obviously a local, you're obviously a tourist but i'm going to get a map out and ask you for directions anyway while my mate pickpockets you, solution - ignore, walk swfitly on. Ploy no 2; Hello would you like to Salsa dance, I'm promoting a club even though I only have 1 small business card but for some reason I want to stand really close to you to show it to you whilst I try and go through your pockets. Solution - smile, keep your distance and walk away. Also saw the pea under 3 tins being done in la ramblas. Avoid.

Also convenient from the hotel is the underground access, there are two stations within 2 mins walk.

We stayed in Hotel Jazz for 3 nights in April 2010. While the Hotel Jazz is very well located (5 mins from Place Catalunya and Ramblas), clean and has friendly English speaking staff, the standard rooms can be very small and it may not suit light sleepers and the 50 + category. This was our third stay here in 2 years. Previously we stayed in one of their larger corner rooms on the sixth floor. This time all we could get in a booking late was a standard room on the 4th floor...the floor from Hell, as it transpired. The room was beside the lift, was very cramped, and had a view of a large grey wall and nearby resident\u2019s washing hanging out to dry. Unfortunately the main problem was NOISE. The Hotel is obviously built directly over the Metro as regularly a low vibrating rumble would permeate the room, lasting about 5 seconds. When we had previously stayed here, we were on the 6th floor and while we could notice the Metro effect then, it was far more noticeable on the 4th floor. So if you\u2019re booking, go for as high a floor as you can get, to get away from the Metro effect. Secondly as the room was right beside the lift, we also had regular lift noise. However staying in a small cramped room looking out the back of the hotel onto a blank cement wall does have one advantage ... you\u2019re not fronting onto the main road. On the two previous occasions we stayed in Hotel Jazz, we had a room which fronted onto the main street. There was a lot of all night traffic noise, police sirens, youths shouting, etc. Finally, the 4th floor must be where all \u2018noisy\u2019 guests are placed, or at least it seemed that way to us. The first night, there was a large group of young English people who appeared to occupy most of our floor. Loud talking, shouting, door banging, etc., at 2 am, 4am, etc.. The following night, mercifully the English appeared to have gone home, but only to be replaced by a large excited group of young Spaniards who also liked to party, it would seem, into the early hours. On the final night, the Spaniards seem to have gone home and all seem quiet for a time ...until a new born baby in a room close by started to wail! As parents ourselves (we have three grown ups) we couldn\u2019t for the life of us comprehend why someone would want to come to a Hotel with a small new born baby who needed to feed regularly? What ever happened consideration for others? I accept that the Hotel can\u2019t be responsible for the guests, but the Hotel can avoid placing a large group all together on the same floor beside other unfortunates who then have to listen to the \u2018fund\u2019 the group are having at all times of the day and night. The Hotel must also know through its pricing policy etc. what end of the market it is attracting. It can't have it everyway. The Hotel is well located, clear and friendly, buy my advice is bring your ear plugs, seek as high a floor as you can get, and don\u2019t take a room beside the lift. As it appears to us that Hotel Jazz are now after a younger more lively crowd (maybe they are deeply discounting their hotel room prices on certain websites attracting young people?) we have decided to move next time on to a more sedate hotel. Hotel Jazz has turned into an Hotel for young people, not for the 50 + group.

Without a doubt, the best way to get to the hotel is via the Aerobus from the airport. The cost is 4.25 euros, which you pay to the driver when you get on. Just make sure you get off at Universtat, which is the third stop from the airport (and a fairly short ride BTW). If you stay on until Pl. Catalunya you will undoubtedly have a much tougher time finding the hotel. From Universtat the hotel is about one block away. It is basically straight ahead in the direction that the bus goes, but a little off to the right. There is a nearby cab stand if you need to ask for directions. In general we thought the hotel was very nice. We stayed on the 4th floor and had no problems with the metro noise. We could definitely hear the subway, but it was nothing more than a minor annoyance. It was not enough to wake me even though I am a fairly light sleeper. I heard it roughly 2 or 3 times an hour. Nor was the street noise an issue; in fact it was fun to watch all the activity out on the street. I had thought about requesting a courtyard room but was glad I did not. I looked into a courtyard room and it appeared smaller than our standard room. Our room had a huge kingsize bed and a fridge big enough to hold large sodas. We ate breakfast twice in the hotel. We thought it was okay. Nothing particularly special. One area they could improve on is keeping fresh eggs out. The eggs we had had definitely been sitting out for some time, and some times there were none. Also, the breakfast room is very nice but there was not enough staff there. Several tables had dirty dishes from customers who were long gone. For late night snacks, there is a McDonalds about 2 blocks away. If you walk left out of the hotel towards Pl. Catalunya it is down on the right side just past Starbucks. Burger King is also just around the corner from there. There is also a KFC not too far away. The hotel is in a good location, although I\u2019m not sure that I would want to stay in that area if I were returning to Barcelona. Why? It is kind of like staying in Times Square in New York. Very, very busy. The advantage to staying there is you can always find something to eat and other conveniences like a small grocery, and transportation options are excellent. We bought a 4-day metro pass downstairs in the metro. We never saw attendants so used a machine, and ended up using cash since we did not know the PIN for our credit card. A 4-day pass was 20 euros. We thought this was well worth it. The buses are fairly easy to use. The metro was a bit more challenging but we did use it a couple of times. Some of the stations were a bit crowded and hot, but we had good experiences on the trains themselves. We did not use the touristic bus. The advantage for the touristic bus would have been not getting lost, which we did a few times. Because we were there for 6 days, getting lost was less of an issue for us. The most fun we had was on a one-day bus tour to Montserrat. It is a monastery on a huge mountain about one hour outside the city. The bus tour begins at 8am and ends at 8pm (except Mondays I believe). They also take you to a winery and the upscale beach town of Stiges. We bought our tickets at the Julia travel agency. If you exit the hotel to the right it is directly across the street. They told us at Julia that you have to book a day in advance, but we saw people paying on the bus the next morning. The bus leaves from near the Aerobus stop at Pl. Catalunya at 8:30. The touristic bus co. actually runs the tour. The cost is 70 euros per person. We thought it was worth the high cost. We did not take the Aerobus on our return to the airport b/c you can only catch it from Pl. Cat. and that was too far (about 3 blocks) to walk with our luggage. The cab ride was a bit more expensive than we thought it would be at 32 euros, not incl. tip. There is a Barclays Bank ATM machine just down the block if you head to the right out of the hotel, going towards Pl. Cat. It is very small and easy to miss, but this is an excellent place to withdraw Euros if you hold a Bank of America ATM (not credit) card b/c Barclays is a partner bank with BOA; you will not be charged any service fees at all. Just make sure you withdraw from your checking, not credit account. I only saw one US branded ATM, a Citibank, just off Pl. Cat., to the left, if you are walking towards that area, I believe near a second Burger King in that area. Upon our return I see on the BOA website that Santander is also a partner. That bank is located throughout the city. We did not have very good luck with restaurants in our 6 days. In fact we found the food quality overall to be average at best. Yet, the cost was quite high, on avg. at least 50 euros or $75US, for two people. We tried a number of places listed in the guide books. The best place we found by far was Monchos, an all-you-can-eat buffet which gives you the advantage to try many different things. And the cost was reasonable, 16 euros per person. It is quite easy to get to by city bus. Take the no. 58 from Pl. Universtat (near where the Aerobus drops you off) and go roughly 6 stops to Travessera de Gracia. It is in a very nice, less touristy neighborhood, and the restaurant is beautiful and had live music when we were there. We flew on Air France from Washington DC, thru Charles de Gaulle. AF was certainly nothing special (our luggage, and several other passengers\u2019, did not make it to Barcelona even though we were on the ground in Paris for over 1.5 hours causing us to spend an extra two hours in the BCN airport waiting for the next flight from Paris). But if you stop over in Paris, make sure you get some croissants and quiche. That was the best food we had the entire trip.", "Date": "October 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "SC", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "Travel-quiz", "ReviewID": "UR47530084", "Content": "My sister and I stayed in Hotel Jazz during the middle of October.

However, when they said we'll be staying in a room with a queen sized bed, they did not mention that there are just two single beds stuck together. Regardless of that, it was comfortable enough to sleep in, and very little noise, as we were on the 5th floor we did not feel the metro going by under ground. Although the cleaning ladies are really really noisy!! The bathroom was also lovely and they had all these kits, dental, shaving, lots of little shampoos, shower gels, and even a sponge! Which for a 3 star was pretty generous, as very rarely would you get this even in a 4 star.. Loved that there was an ambience music in the room and bathroom. Really nice of them to have free internet for guests, although there were only 2 pc's, it wasn't that busy so you could browse for free in peace.. It was great lounging around by the pool, we stayed from 29th Sept to 4th Oct and the weather was still really nice, around 25C. They give out free towels, and the beds are quite comfortable. The pool was small, but that didn't bother us as neither of us swim! The very few things we weren't really happy about is that there was no ironing board in the room, and you could only iron your clothes with their service which is only until 20.00, and per shirt they asked \u20ac5.00. Also, when we were checking out the receptionist was nothing but unfriendly, and we had to ask the same question about 4 times to get an answer out of her.

Instead of being charged the meter reading of 35 Euros we were charged 55 with explaintion that the extra charge was for two people. Rather than have an argument and miss our flight we paid. With the Barcelona Card the bus would have been a fraction of that cost. Barcelona is a dynamic city with much to recommend. Restaurants: check out El Quatro Cats and Taller Tapas.

It is a very tastefully done and comfortable hotel, and for 100 Euro/night very reasonably priced. The hotel is fairly new, but unlike many newer hotels that have no character or charm, this place is really quite nice. The location is great about a block from the Rambus for shopping and dining, and about a block from two Metro stops. The rooms are very nicely done with tasteful furniture and very nice bathrooms. All of the rooms have a glass door that you can open to a false balcony, just a railing with no room to go out. This allows you to get some fresh air, see what the weather is like or just people watch on the street. My favorite part is the roof top pool. Not a huge pool, but adequate with plenty of deck area for sunbathing and looking out over the city. There is also a great outside rooftop bar. Many of the other rooftop bars in Barcelona are expensive and dressy. The bar here is very inexpensive and low key. Just a great place to go up at night, have a drink and relax looking out over the city. I am sure you can find more expensive hotels and also fancier hotels, but this is a very nice comfortable and well designed hotel that is very reasonably price. You can't go wrong staying here.

It is small, the pool is small and only 1m deep, more for cooling off than swimming but it is peaceful, clean and has lovely views.

Unfortunately the terrace bar wasn't open during our stay so I can't say what the food / service was like although it appeared to be reasonably priced. This menu is also the room service menu and the mini bar was also cheaper than we expected. However the breakfast (continental buffet style) was 15,50 each!

The hotel lobby is without doubt one of the most unwelcoming and drab that I have ever seen. We visited the bar once - walked in, round about it and then out.

Considering it is on a fairly busy street our room was very quiet.(sixth floor).definately recommend.we did not have the breakfast included in our price so went out for breakfast.If you like cereals, and Muesli..better include the breakfast in the hotel as outside is pastries, coffee, eggs and fruit down at the Bocquira/Market.", "Date": "September 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location and good value\u201d", "Author": "karensydneyaustralia", "ReviewID": "UR39629496", "Content": "We stayed for 5 days at this hotel and were really impressed with the location and value that was offered. -Australian couple", "Date": "September 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wakefield UK", "Title": "\u201cLived up to expectations\u201d", "Author": "SMW20", "ReviewID": "UR39584302", "Content": "Booked as a surprise by my husband based on reviews on this site and we were not disappointed.

The room and bathroom were spacious and extremely well appointed - probaby the best city room we have stayed in terms of size/value for money.

The location of the hotel was ideal for both walking and public transport for all areas of the city. The staff were always helpful and pleasant. The rooftop pool was an added bonus to dip into after a day of sightseeing. It was well kept, very clean and tidy. However, one area of improvement (although a Europe wide problem) would be not to allow guests to reserve sunbeds by the pool. The pool area is small with only @ 15 sunbeds therefore when we arrived late afternoon normally all the beds were already 'reserved', often with no-one appearing within the hour that we were there.

It is about a two minute walk to the Universitat train station with lines that take you to Sagrada Familia, the pier end of La Rambla, the trendy El Born area in a few stops. The hotel is surrounded by good places to eat, and is a short walk to the fantastic market La Boqueria off La Rambla. I like the look of this hotel. Very hip, very \"today\" in a thoughtful way. The rooms are of blacks and neutrals with little punches of color like red and orange. Loved the HUGE room numbers on the doors. Such a playful and quirky touch :-) The lobby is black and grey--small compared to traditional hotels but does the job! Who needs a fancy lobby. Staff are efficient, friendly and helpful. There are two computers offering complimentary internet access on the second floor where the restaurant/ bar is. There's no printer but front desk would be happy to print your document for you if you email it to their mailbox, at no charge to the guest. We never went to the bar of the hotel but did do breakfast there. Hotel Jazz breakfasts are really quite fabulous. I'd say they're above and beyond the typical breakfast fare! Dizzying array of options. There's hot and cold fare, grains and nuts, meats, eggs, omelets to order, fresh cut fruit and juices, coffee and tea, assorted pastries, assorted breads, olive oil dip and a wonderful light tomato puree of sorts to spread on the bread. Breakfast is served from 730 to 11 so it makes a wonderful, substantial brunch for those on a holiday who I guarantee will be finding themselves waking up late in the mornings. Though my husband and I share a king-sized bed back home I thought the standard double bed was comfortable for two people. Rooms have flat screen TV with cable, a hair-dyrer, a socket outlet with dual voltage for non-European made appliances in the bathroom. Did not see if wake up calls could be requested but we brought our own travel clock (our companions just used their i-phones for alarm clocks). There's a safety deposit box in the closet to store your valuables too. We enjoyed the rooftop pool. It is a small pool, certainly not for diving nor doing laps but again it does the job! Great for cooling off in the hot summer afternoons. Guests can enjoy it until about 9pm. The hotel rooftop has a bar area too that's open till midnight (If I remember right) and offers a nice breezy retreat for groups enjoying a game of bridge or another. Piped in music fills the air as you sip your Sangria or Cava planning your adventures for the next day! There is handicapped access in the lobby and even in the pool area.

We were given the key to a VERY small room in that hotel that we could not even fit our luggage into. We then had to move all of our luggage to another larger room in that hotel ourselves.

I felt that we were not appreciated as customers, as they CONFIRMED our reservation twice via email, then we had no room at Hotel Jazz when we arrived and were shown to another inferior hotel. I believe this was due to the fact that we had a one night reservation, as other people (probably with longer stays booked) were staying in Hotel Jazz.

The location of the hotel is perfect, if you take the Aerobus from the airport (about 5 Euro's each) and get off at the Universitat stop it is literally a couple of minutes walk to the hotel. It is also only about 5 minutes walk to Las Ramblas and Placa De Catalunya where all the tour buses go from. The room itself was nice, my first impressions weren't great due to a broken lampshade which was stuck with sticky tape together. That aside the room was modern and clean and room service promptly cleaned every day. I did miss having no tea/ coffee making facilities although the fridge, safe and massive bed was an added bonus. The roof top bar in particular was a nice touch and the pool looked very inviting although I never actually got to take a dip! We stayed on the top floor (7th) and occasionally heard the Metro underneath although it did not disturb us. I recommend buying a two day Bus Turistic tour ticket from Placa De Catalunya. We did the red route on day one and blue the next for 27 Euro's each, which was ideal as we got to see all the major sights at our own pace. Initially we struggled to find nightlife but after two days finally discovered a strip of about 15 bars located on the bottom level at Port Olympic. There are also a strip of about 10 upmarket restaurants and bars along the beach front at Port Olympic which were nice with an added beach view. Drinks were very expensive everywhere. I thoroughly recommend visiting the Skky vodka ice bar on the beach front just for pure novelty value (it is -9 degrees inside, you drink from cups made of ice and are given fur coats and gloves to wear). You can't stay in too long because of the cold but it was fun and something different. Entrance is 15 euro's each and that includes a drink. Wasn't all that impressed by Ramblas. I think the crime topic is over-hyped slightly, there is a big police presence but we did see many suspicious characters and a scam in action with two female tourists so be aware/ alert and don't get into conversations with strangers who approach you.

The price of the hotel is affordable and the hotel staff, especially those who work in the morning, provided us with very useful information for both in and around the city. For example, they told us about a beach city, Sitges, which is about a 30min train ride from Barcelona with incredible beaches in a safe and relaxing atmosphere.

The Hotel is located a 3 minute walk from the main center of Barcelona and the Ramblas. So an excellent location. It was my first trip to barcelona with my boyfriend and my first holiday abroad without my family so I was a bit nervous when setting out on my trip but after being there for a very short amount of time I felt right at home and the Jazz helped make my stay very enjoyable. The Jazz is clean and very modern with a smart front desk and mainly very helpful staff giving suggestions for things to do and places to eat (we only had a problem with one woman we found a bit rude when we first arrived). The rooms are spacious with all the mod-cons you could want (TV, Air-con, Safe, Fridge). There is a supermarket a short walk down the Ramblas where we bought bread, butter, cheese ect so we could make our own snack and drinks and the hotel were completly happy with us keeping our own food in the min fridge. The maid was also very helpful and gave us everything we could need for our stay. The Hotel also has a roof top pool, it is not massive but is perfect for a quick dip to cool down in the hot weather and there are plently of fresh towels and sunbeds for you to relax on. One thing that confussed us was the lighting in our room! We didn't realise that you had to insert a room key into the slot on the wall to activate the lights, tv ect! this is to save people leaving the lights on when they leave the room, a great idea, but someone should have told us on arrival!! We also managed to lock our safe incorrectly so that we could not open it again and when we called the frond desk someone came up straight away to sort it. Some people have mentioned the rumble you hear from the metro, they are right you can hear it during the day but it never disturbed our sleep or bothered us to much and we were on the 3rd floor so I imagine the higher you get the less you hear it. Overal a GREAT hotel and would happily go there again. Two tips for barcelona - to get the best rate in this hotel is to call the hotel and ask which nights are avaliable at there lowest rate of 95euros and to then book online because you get a 10% discount if you book in advance - Another is to ask at the front desk for discount vouchers as you get money off attractions and the Bus touristic (another thing well worth going on!)", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tyne & Wear", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "JoSno", "ReviewID": "UR34004740", "Content": "Great location with the staff very friendly and helpful.

The front desk later confirmed that that had nothing to do with their eco policy. The wear and tear signs were eminent here and there but in general, it was all acceptable, better than Radisson or Holiday Inn or Courtyard ranges in room decors. The second is, there were two pickpocket attempts during our 3 night stay, approaching tourists at night and distracting one while robbing the other while hugging them or shaking hands while covering their acts with maps or jackets they carry. And, finally, Rambla is a real disappointment all the way to the waterfront. And, from the half way(Liceu station) to the Columbus column/water front, The street was filled with more African Prostitutes, who are often aggressive, than the strollers. And, I would advise any family with children not to visit this place at night. The noise/vibration from the hotel room on the 5th floor(516) was acceptable comparing its proximity to Universitat station( second building from the entrance, 100ft away) and the bed is comfortable without giving any back pain in the morning. I always felt well-rested. The AC actually works after 5 min. and upon check-in, I sweated a bucketful before the room was cool.(the outdoor temp for June was 28-30'C and very hot). In all, Jazz Hotel met my expectation and I would recommend this place to others for its ideal location and better than average features.", "Date": "June 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cGood all-rounder\u201d", "Author": "anneeUk", "ReviewID": "UR32439211", "Content": "We travelled to Barcelona to celebrate my husband\u2019s birthday and chose to stay at the Jazz as he likes contemporary hotels. It proved to be a good choice. The location is very good, handy for transport links and close enough to walk to many of the main sights. And having experienced the crowds on Las Ramblas, I was relieved we had not chosen a hotel there, as I really wouldn't have liked all that hustle and bustle every time I left/returned to the hotel. Yet the Jazz is only a five minute walk away from all of this - so ideal in my opinion. We took the airport bus and got off at Universistat (cost about 4 euros each) - this is only a couple of minute walk from the hotel. For the return you have to go to Placa Catalunya, approx 5 min walk away - and as this is the first pickup at least you'll get a seat - the airport buses were very crowded. We couldn't get a great room rate that many have spoken about, despite an exhaustive search, so ended up paying an average of \u00a3140 per night, room only - it was the Friday night stay that bumped up the price. However they did upgrade us to a corner room, a large room which consisted of a living area - sofa, table and chairs and separate sleeping area. There is a mini bar but no tea/coffee making facilities. The room is very contemporary in style; my husband loved it and thought it better than most 4 star hotels we've stayed in. I find the contemporary style rather bland - but that\u2019s my personal taste - there was certainly nothing to complain about, contemporary, clean and in good condition. The bathroom was great - fantastic shower. I thought the toiletries provided were excellent for a 3 star hotel, although replacement of them was erratic, but I\u2019m sure you only had to ask for more. We were on the second floor and although you could occasionally notice the rumble from the underground, it was only very slight and certainly wouldn't have disturbed our sleep. We also didn't notice any noise from the street. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel, there are plenty of little cafes around and the wonderful La bouqueria. There is a small rooftop pool and reasonable sized terrace. The pool was another reason why I'd booked this hotel, but in fact there was so much to see and do in Barcelona that we never got chance to use it. The roof terrace has great views of the city and is a nice place to have an evening drink. The hotel has a bar but it seems to close early - but I suppose you have to remember it is a three star. We found all the staff in reservations and reception to be very helpful and efficient. As it was our first trip to the city we used the tourist bus, which departs from Placa Catalunya (5 mins walk away). Although a bit time consuming, it allowed us a real feel for the city and I think we saw more than if we had been left to our own devices. One word of warning re Barcelona - pickpockets. I'd become a little bored with people mentioning the problem to me when I told them we were going to Barcelona. But I'm afraid they were so right - it is a real problem here. And you need to be aware all the time. We were able to alert someone who's purse was about to be stolen as she was getting on the bus from the airport. The thief disappeared but later as our bus pulled out of the airport we saw the same young women combing the queues for another victim. What a dreadful start to your holiday that would be. And from the top of the tourist bus we saw a similar situation in Placa Catalunya. So beware when you are queues or crowds. Now back to the hotel. My husband really loved it and I\u2019m possibly being a bit mean with giving it a rating of 4 rather than 5. But for me it lacked a wow factor, and I find the contemporary style rather soulless. But personal decor taste aside this is a really good hotel, in a handy location with great staff. Would I recommend it to my friends - absolutely - particularly if you can get one of those great rates.", "Date": "June 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "seattle", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Barcelona experience\u201d", "Author": "worldtraveledSeattle", "ReviewID": "UR32377561", "Content": "Our stay at the Jazz hotel was excellent.

It was nice, but definitely a lot of money for what it was. We decided to venture out of the hotel for breakfast every day after that. They had wi-fi in the rooms, but it was not a good connection and went in and out. The only major complaint I have about the hotel was that they closed the rooftop pool without giving us any notice. We stayed for three nights. The first night we decided not to use the pool because we were tired. When we went to use it the second day, there was simply a sign in the elevator saying it would be closed for the remainder of our time at the hotel.

The hotel itself is very modern, looks brand new, extremely clean and quiet. We had a room on the 4th floor and there was no sound. My only complaints would be the rooms are decorated in dark brown colours which makes it quite dark, but the windows are large and it was sunny when we went so plenty of light entered the room anyway. Also, our shampoo and shower gel was never replaced and we had to ring reception for new ones every evening (one time they did not have any left). There was no mirror in the main room area, only on the bathroom door where there was very limited light so it was extremely hard to do make-up - take your own mirror!

Breakfast was not inlcuded in the cost but is available for 15 Euro per person which we considered quite expensive. There are plenty of cafe's where you can have breakfast but if you want to experience the real Barcelona go to the \"Boqueria\" which is a large and very colourful market just off La Rambla, we ate breakfast there and it only cost 12 euro for both of us. There are numerous restaurants to chose from but one I would heartily recommend is Cafe Academia which is situated in the Gothic district. Friendly staff and excellent service along with wonderful food made for a very enjoyable evening. One restaurant we were disappointed with was \"Siete Puertes\" situated near the Port. Service was way to fast for our liking with each course being served almost as the previous plates were cleared. My husband asked for his steak to be well cooked and he was told he should have the veal instead. He then settled for a medium steak but when it arrived it was raw.

The entrance is in a small paved area just off the street. The walk will take you about 5 mins max. I cannot praise this hotel enough, staff very friendly and helpful, rooms clean and spacious, great shower, comfortable bed. Roof patio is lovely, gives you a sense of space and being away from the city. The pool is small, but hey its a pool! Breakfast (buffet style) available for 15 Euro which i thought was a little steep but it was lovely food and we ended up taking it as it was easy and it set us up for the day. The best part of this hotel ? Its location is simply perfect. You are in an area that feels safe, and its close to pretty much all you need. We walked everywhere from this hotel. Ramblas is 5 minutes (our least favourite street in city as is simply all about tourism, i guess all cities have one) the beach area is 25-30 minutes walk. Dont be afraid to explore this gorgeous cultural city and wander and get lost in ts narrow streets, you'll find hidden gems! Hotel jazz is the perfect base to begin and end your days exploring, eating and soaking up the chilled out but vibrant Barcelona! If I have to find negatives then they are minor: Yes you hear the metro at night, a low rumble but its gone away after a few seconds and wont come back for 10-15 minuets or so. Really didn't bother us much at all. No tea / coffee in room. Thats it.

Fine for two girls getting ready for a night out, so I think that's quite telling. The air-con is great, because you can control it from your room to get the right level, and it does get very hot in Barcelona in July! We used the roof-top pool, which is a wonderful treat. It's not a massive pool, but it's all you need to cool off. There are free sunbeds, and decking, as well as a roof-top bar, so you can order sangria or a beer and drink it by the pool, looking over the city. There is also another bar downstairs, which has a good selection of spirits and friendly barmen. We didn't take breakfast in the hotel, but there are lots of shops and cafes within walking distance.

The room has climate control which was lovely because sometimes hotel rooms can be very warm and stuffy. My only fault with the hotel is that there is no hospitality tray and it is nice to be able to make a cup of coffee after a long day sightseeing. However there is a starbucks and many other places for take away coffee on the doorstep, also, there was a very strong smell of smoke in the room on our arrival. We did not have breakfast in the hotel because it was quiet expensive and I was glad of that because we discovered La Boqueria a food marked located off La Rambla you must visit there.

One thing the metro system is difficult to use, and signage to some attractions are non-existent. I would think the tourist buses are best for getting around, and seeing the sight.

Since we had asked for two rooms close to each other, they were not able to provide both rooms so early in the morning. They did provide one room with promises that when the second room close by was available they would provide us with access. They delivered on the promise. The rooms are modern and of average size for European hotel rooms., not as large as typical American hotel rooms but certainly not small. As requested, one room had a queen bed and the other had two twins. Each room had a flat screen LCD TV, a comfortable sitting chair and a chair/desk. Internet was available and the wi-fi signal was strong. I believe they also had ethernet available. A safe was provided in the ample-sized closet. The rooms had full functioning doors rather than windows but neither room had a balcony so the doors were for ventilation only. The bathroom was clean, modern and well-supplied. The heating worked well when used. Although any view from the hotel (we had two of three sides covered with corner rooms!) are of streets below and certainly not scenic, the location was excellent.

We were not disappointed. We spent a week here over the Christmas period and it was perfect for our needs. Check in was efficient and I was very pleased when we were able to check in early (at 8:30am)! we were not expecting this and welcomed the chance to have a nap following our sleepless night on the overnight train from Paris. The room itself was very spacious (room 604) and looked out onto a busy shopping street. With the door shut the thick double glazing did its job and we could hardly hear the street. The bed as others have stated is MASSIVE and is two large singles / queens zip and locked together. The wardrobe was equally huge and we had a niced dressing area near the bathroom. The fixtures and fittings were modern and contemporary and we particularly liked the unusual wall and floor coverings. Being on the 6th floor we felt nothing of the metro system underneath the hotel but sat in the bar on the 1st floor you could feel it - which could be a contributing factor for the low prices in this quality hotel. We got a room rate of \u00a388 on expedia which we were pleased with. The roof terrace is a peaceful haven in the city and on christmas day we sat in the sun by the pool on the sun loungers and it was just blissful. I tried to swim but it was too cold! It would be fab if the pool was heated in winter but there you go. The bar was useful for a quick drink before heading out and for using the internet. It was fairly empty though. We had the spanish omelette and the pizza in the bar but there are more interesting places to eat in the city. There is also free wifi in every room though and we made good use of this. The staff we came across were pleasant. efficient and polite but not effervescent. Fine for our needs. We had no problems with room service, the room was spotless every day. The bathroom was clean and the hot water plentiful. The hotel in general is very warm but each room has its own aircon so within minutes you can be icy cool! We didnt take breakfast in the hotel but there is a supermarket just down the street and starbucks too which was open even on Christmas day. As others have said we couldnt fault the location, very close to La Ramblas and Place De Catalunya from where you can get the opentop bus, airport bus, and there is a metro station right outside the hotel.

We booked our stay through the hotel and got an even better rate than was available on the website. The four nights for us both cost about 510 euro, including the 7% tax. The real selling point for the Jazz is the location. It's between the Place Catalunya at the top of the Ramblas, and Place Universtat. The Ramblas is less than five minutes walk away, and it's possible to walk most places. During our four days, we never used the metro, and only took a taxi once (in search of a restaurant that proved not to be worth the trek!) We also used the open-top tour buses two days, and other than that we walked every where. There's no need to pay 150 euro each for breakfast. We ate on two mornings in a little bar/tapas place across the road (I think it was Biere D'Or) and other mornings just picked little cafes off the Ramblas - and about 10 euro should cover two people. We were on the very top floor, so we had no problems with noise - even even had a tiny balcony over-looking the busy Pelai Street. The hotel bar is handy for a drink before going out, and we also used the internet there to check out restaurant reviews before we went out! It's not the kind of place where you'd spent an entire evening, and it didn't really stay open late enough for a nightcap, but for what it was it was fine. We had very little contact with reception, or staff in general. They weren't exactly over-friendly - but they were efficient and as I've already said, for the price you couldn't do much better. We had lovely tapas on our last evening just around the corner from the hotel - come out of the hotel and turn right, and cross the street in front of you, turn right and then turn left at the next junction - the restaurant should be on the corner ahead of you on your left. I think it was called Dancerama or something like that. 35 euro got us more plates of tapas than we could eat, ice-cream and two beers! But back to the Jazz. For a city break where you're not going to be spending much time at the hotel, the Jazz is perfect - spotlessly clean, comfortable, modern and well-priced.

I chose the Jazz based on the excellent recommendations here. All of us (we had two rooms) couldn't have been more pleased with the hotel. We arrived early on a Sunday morning, and asked to get into our rooms early. The desk clerk offered us rooms on the third floor, but had nothing at that time on higher floors. The only big negative in reviews was feeling the subway rumbling (and it seemed that only those below the fourth floor felt the rumbling), so I chose to wait for rooms on a higher floor. They stored our bags for us, and we waited on comfortable sofas in the lobby (where we did feel the subway rumbling under us). After about an hour (around 10:30 am) there were rooms available on the fourth floor for us. On the fourth floor, none of us ever noticed any noise or rumbling during our stay. One room faced the street, and one faced the courtyard. With windows closed, both rooms were extremely quiet and we all slept well. The beds are comfortable, and everything was very clean. The rooms were a bit small, but very comfortably arranged - and a great value for the 105 euros we paid for a double room (with queen bed). We didn't have breakfast at the hotel (it didn't look interesting) but there is a snack bar next to the hotel entry, and a Starbucks less than a block away. I have to confess that I really enjoyed Starbucks after a couple weeks of European coffee! So I ran for Starbucks and pastries every morning - fine for breakfast. The only negative during our stay was trying to drink our Starbucks at a table next to the bar while waiting to use the PC - the restaurant staff was quite nasty in telling us to get out (despite the restaurant being totally empty). The bar was nice for a quiet nightcap after dinner - but definitely not a swinging hot spot. If I was looking for nightlife in Barcelona, it seems to me that any hotel bar would be a boring choice! The pool was closed due to cool and rainy weather, but it looked like it would be nice. The free wi-fi worked great, and it was absolutely fabulous to have a free PC with a fast Internet connection for guests to use. We had a little work crisis, and it was a lifesaver! And we found the front desk to be very kind and helpful. They let us in the room early, gave us directions, made restaurant reservations. The English was a bit limited, but they did their best and we thank them for their help. Best of all was the location, just two short blocks to Catalunya (central point for the hop-on/off bus) and Las Ramblas.

The hotel is very conveniently located in the centre of the city. First impressions of the reception area is functional but rather uninspiring and bland. The check in process was quite slow and there was some confusion about how many rooms had been reserved. I was on the fourth floor and my friend was on the seventh floor. Initial impressions of the room - very monochrome, masculine decor and a bit dark for my personal taste, hard floors, good quality furnishings, good cleanliness, excellent wardrobe with safe inside, massive and very comfortable bed. I walked into the bathroom and there was a very unpleasant smell (think sweaty socks...) coming from the washbasin. My friend's bathroom didn't have the same problem. Reported it to reception on Saturday morning but it was still there by the time we checked out on Sunday. Apart from this (hopefully isolated) incident, the bathroom was really superb with a refreshingly powerful shower. From the fourth floor, you could hear the distant rumble of the metro trains but it didn't bother me at all. Both of our rooms were on the inside courtyard rather than the street which certainly reduces the light at the window but also makes them very quiet. There is a sliding door which is good if you want fresh air. The air conditioning was quiet and worked well. Room lighting was also very good. We used the breakfast buffet both mornings. As is the norm with similar hotels, it is expensive but there was a good range of food and service was efficient, so if you have a big appetite at breakfast then it's good value and very convenient of course. We didn't use room service but from looking at the menu, the prices seemed quite reasonable which is a rarity. The roof terrace is really stunning with wonderful views of the city. I suppose we were at the wrong end of summer but it was still quite warm and there was only ever one or two other people up there. It does seem very strange that it closes so early because it's such a great asset to the hotel. So to sum up, a good value, very comfortable hotel.

The pros: The rooms are really beautiful. Trendy, attractive and comfortable. The staff was also welcoming and helpful.

There is a metro stop just a few steps away and it is in close proximity to some sites as well. There is also a great view from the rooftop pool which seems well maintained and a nice refreshing way to end a long day. Check out is 11am which is good as we like a later checkout. The cons: Breakfast is expensive. And is fine. But not impressive. We stayed on the 4th floor but at times, could still hear the metro running past below. It didn't disturb us really but it might do on lower floors. The airco works. Yet, it was directed just at the area where your head lays on the pillow. Rather uncomfortable and not good for the sinuses. The pool is far too small for the number of guests in the hotel. We had to hang around for nearly an hour before even getting a chair. When we finally did get one, it turned out to be broken. Plus, there seem to be a lot of guests who just place a towel down to reserve a chair, then never return.

One key aspect was the attitude of the staff who were quite simply excellent - some reviews on TA had questioned their attitude but they were exceptionally helpful and courteous to us, answering questions, giving advice allowing me to print things for free from the reception PC's and so on. The rooftop pool is a great addition and one of the reasons we chose the Jazz and it provided a great place to relax when not out trawling Barca. Towels are provided by the pool. A bar / cafe is available on the roof, however, we chose to just buy baguettes from the shop next door and to eat them by the pool. Travelling from the airport, the aeorbus (about 4 Euros each) takes you to Universitaat where it is literally a 2-minute walk to the hotel - unfortunately, it only picks up again from Placa Catalunya which, with a suitcase is more like a 7-10 minute walk. We got a taxi back to the airport which cost 35 Euros with tip. I was in Barcelona for work and therefore my hotel was paid for on expenses. The total cost for the 6 nights stay was \u00a3900, which for a 3-star hotel is a lot of money, and this would normally be over my budget if travelling for leisure. This price didn't include breakfast either. The Jazz is, however, a well placed and excellently managed hotel with great service and therefore if you can afford to pay these prices, it's a solid bet that it will provide an excellent base to discover Barcelona.", "Date": "July 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Henley-on-Thames, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThumbs up for the Jazz\u201d", "Author": "sullytex", "ReviewID": "UR18090343", "Content": "Hotel Jazz was a great stay.

Its location (near the Placa Catalunya, La Rambla, and the shopping area along the Passeig Gracia) is superb. It's also near several Metro stations, which makes getting to other areas of the city a breeze. The rooms are spotless and a good size for a city like Barcelona and the location of the hotel. Our room (on the 4th floor) was very quiet. Periodically, we could hear the subway rumbling below, but it was not a distraction in any respect. Minibar is great as it is big and they don't fill it full of stuff, so there is plenty of room to put your own water bottles and a bottle of wine or snacks. No concierge and the front desk staff seemed somewhat willing to assist, but certainly not rushing to provide advice or assistance. Just don't rely on them for anything other than check-in; check-out; and wake-up calls (by the way, the rooms have no bedside clock, which I thought was strange). The shower/bath combination is strange in that the piece of glass that is intended to enclose the shower is not large enough. It makes for somewhat of a chilly shower and the water gets on the floor. However, the water pressure is excellent by European standards and there is plenty of very hot water. As noted in previous reviews, the amenities are poor and not abundant (the soap bar literally lasts for one shower--not sure how it dissolves so quickly). Based on the prior reviews, I brought a few small bars from another hotel to supplement. Also, there is no box of Kleenex--only a small packet with about 8 tissues. If there is one thing about the rooms that the management needs to improve, it is the bath amenities. We didn't eat in the restaurant and the bar looked empty and depressing, so we stayed away. I did ask for a glass in the bar since there were not enough in our room, and the surely bartender refused. Not sure what he thought I was going to do with the glass. Overall, we had a very good experience. The main thing is that the hotel was clean, quiet, safe, well-located, and provided a good night sleep.

There is a Starbucks on the way which was great for the morning coffee and plenty of bars , shops etc. and you are only max 2 min walk to the top of Las Ramblas. The rooftop solarium and pool are perfect for a city and the views are quite extensive. We never tried room service etc or the bar as we were out most of the time. Now to Housekeeping, this is where many hotels get it wrong but at the Jazz it was absolutely spotless everyday and the staff deserve a special thanks. Every day when we came back the room looked perfect - we were so impressed we left an extra large tip for the cleaners - they deserve it - well done ! Make sure you go to the old market just of Las Ramblas - if you are going down from the top it is about 100m on the right.

Other than a great room, the hotel has nothing to offer, breakfast (included in our deal) was only so & so, waitresses were running away & hiding in the klitchen instead of seeing to people's tables, you had to literally go & stand by the kitchen door to grab one of them as they came out to ask for your coffee, an omelette etc... and then they still ignored you, also not much choice, but hey it's only a 3-star.

Having stayed in Barcelona on 3 previous occasions, I can safely say this is my least favourite hotel. Whilst the rooms were clean and reasonably well equipped, there was an unpleasant damp smell in the bathroom and no mirror in the bedroom. For those who rely on straighterners or tongs, it was a thankless task styling hair in a steamy bathroom! When the mini bar was restocked it was irratic and on one occassion I had to request clean towels as these had not been replenished by housekeeping. We were room only and were not impressed that on 2 of the 3 mornings cleaning in the corridors started at 8.45, not the alarm call that we had requested! In addition,I can not endorse other reviews relating to the staff. The reception staff were fine but I was rather disappointed that a security guard /concierge (not sure which)watched myself and two daughters struggle down reception stairs with heavy cases without offering to help. The bar, although pleasant ,was irritatating as it was never staffed and it was impossible to get a drink after 11.30pm! The one plus re this area was that internet access is free! I also was disappointed that staff were not more supportive towards a young honeymoon couple whose luggage had been lost and when reunited with its owners was badly creased. The couple asked for the use of an iron but were told that this was not possible and that there was a charge of 5euros to iron each garment My main reason for selecting this hotel however was to take advantage of the rooftop pool. On the first day the weather was 21c and I looked forward to taking a dip. I was disappointed by the size, barely bigger than my bath, and the concept that the pool is heated was laughable.

I reserved the hotel based on the reviews from tripadvisor. The first thing I want to mention is that the hotel is very conveniently located. It is just two very short blocks away from the subway's interchange station CATALUNYA, where you can connect to L1, L3 and other lines that virtually take you everywhere. L3 runs from the north to the south of the La Rambla. L1 let you connect to L4, which allows you to get around the old town easily. If you wish to stick to L1, then the hotel is one block away from L1's UNIVERSITAT. In fact you can see that subway stop right from the front door of the hotel. The hotel is about 3 blocks away from the La Rambla. So you can walk there within 5 minutes but are exempted from the parties and noises along that street. We did not breakfast at the hotel. There is a Starbucks one block down from the hotel. Then there is a Cafe Zurich one block further. Both offer great coffee and pastries at decent prices (I cannot say \"cheap\" anymore at the rate the Euro is claiming up against the dollar). The hotel itself is clean and trendy. The people at the front desk are very friendly and speak very good English -- especially after I arrived in Madrid and was shocked by how poorly English was spoken, even in the top 5 star hotel. I am quite impressed with the size of the room -- being to Europe numerous times myself, I am used to small and crowded hotel rooms, especially at the price we paid. The bathroom is also spacious. We stayed at rooms 416 and 417 and we did notice the noise from the subway underneath as other travelers have pointed out. But it did not bother us that much since we do not stay at the room during the day and during the evening the metros are less frequent. I do think they should offer more towels. The only reason that I gave 4 instead of 5 stars for this hotel is the bar. I really think the hotel should fire its bartender. The first night we stopped by for a drink, it was 11:05 and the bar area was already dark (though you can still see some people sitting and chatting in the bar area). So we went downstairs and asked the front desk. The front desk ensured us that the bar is open and the gentleman tried to call the bartender. But after ten minutes he told us there must be some problem because there is no response. The next night we stopped by around 10:40 PM and the bar was open. However, the bartender had such a nasty attitude as if we were bothering him and he really just wanted to get rid of us. All the drinks (very basic ones) we asked were greeted with either a cold and simple \"No\", or \"We do not make that\". At some point I could not help but started laughing. My husband had to instruct him to make a simple cocktail and he literally screwed it up right in front of us (not sure if this was done on purpose). While we were sitting in the bar area chatting, the bartender walked by and shut off the light. So he probably thought that his bar -- which the hotel told us to open pass 11:00 PM -- should be closed before 11:00 PM despite there were still customers. Now some more tips: (1) I found the map provided by the front desk of the hotel is quite useful. Speaking of city maps, please save your money and stay away from MapEasy\u2019s Guidemap to Barcelona and Madrid. They are full of mistakes and mislabels. We tried three restaurants marked on their maps: One is located completely on a different street from what the map says \u2013 this incident happened in Barcelona. One is no longer there anymore (replaced by a Burberry Shop) and the other is closed \u2013 both occurred in Madrid. The city map that I found more reliable is Streetwise Barcelona and Streetwise Madrid. (2) Almost all the guidebooks would suggest you to buy a T-10 ticket: for the price of 7 trips you can get on the metro for 10 trips. But if you buy T-10 ticket you cannot use the free transfer that you are entitled if you would have just bought one single ticket \u2013 which allows you to transfer within 75 minutes.", "Date": "April 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "chirpyLondon", "ReviewID": "UR14619790", "Content": "Not too much to say which has not already been said, nice, clean and very enjoyable stay, would recommend this hotel very good location and service spot on.

We had booked a 3 day Winter Sales Package, which included a bottle of champagne upon arrival and daily breakfast. I had asked the hotel if my daughter could check in early and they did not promise that the room would be ready. But when she arrived, since the standard room that we had reserved was not ready, she was upgraded to a junior suite for free! We had a lovely large space divided in two by a half wall, with a flat screen tv in front of the bed and a couch on the other side. If you do not like contemporary architecture and design, pick another hotel. I love it, so I felt perfectly at home surrounded by linear furniture, black, brown and white decor, and a new clean wooden floor that felt so much nicer than the worn out carpets that usually cover hotel room floors. Black and white photos of jazz playing instruments hands decorate the walls of the hotel and of the rooms. Service was extremely quick and kind, everything worked well, the bathroom had both a tub and a shower (again, it was all black and white, if you are into antiques, or decorated details, go elsewhere), lots of amenities, a powerful hair dryer, the only thing missing is a little shelf inside the shower stall to put the soap or foam bottle. The location of the hotel is perfect, at a few minutes walk from Placa Catalunya, and the first stop of the Bus Turistic right across the street, next to the Metro stop. Breakfast was abundant and with lots of things to pick from, the different varieties of breads were delicious. Our room was on the third floor, so unfortunately we felt the vibrations of the Metro beneath us, but only until 11 pm, and then again from 6 am, though at that hour we were still deeply asleep.

But I have found this to be fairly common in major European cities in this price range. We were on the 7th/top floor and were impressed by how sound proof the french door/window was since the hotel is on a busy street. The only noise that disturbed us came from the hallway. This door definitely needs sound proofing. The hotel staff was helpful though not of four star service caliber. For example, when I checked in on my own (my husband arrived later in the day) I was struggling with my bags as I walked down the lobby steps. No other guests were in the lobby and none of the staff attempted to assist me (I don't think there are any bellboys here). So not a major let down -but if you love doting service this is not the place for you. The location is great - a few block away from Placa Cataluyna and the old city. Definitely check out the Boqueria food market on Las Ramblas.

Mrs C had booked a room on the 6th floor, following other Trip Advisor reviews and in fairness the metro rumble did not bother us at all. We did not have breakfast in the hotel as there is so much choice close by and at much better prices! In reality we enjoyed the hotel as a place to sleep and freshen up as Barcelona has so much to offer - one criticism would be that we did not find the beds overly conducive to a good nights sleep. For us the Harbour area was perfect....beautiful walks and lovely street cafes & bars line this spectacular area. One bonus was that we were able to obtain tickets to see Barca playing, albeit against a 3rd division side in the Copa del Rey. The ground is easy to get to from the hotel using the metro and is a must see on any trip to the city. All in all we would thoroughly recommend the Jazz - it lived up to its reviews!

There is a very small bar area, but it closed around 9:30 pm on the two nights we tried to go there! The breakfast is expensive, and in no way worth it. The staff are either helpful, or very unhelpful. There are times when there is only one person at the desk which can be frustrating. When unhelpful, the staff borders on rude. We had bad experiences with room service as well with it not being delivered at all on two occasions. Their toiletries were also pretty disappointing. Were I to return, I would bring my own. In addition, their recommendations for restaurants and the like are pretty awful. I can wholeheartedly recommend a new restaurant in the area on Ramblas Catalunya (I think #13) called Mata Mala.

The concierge was very helpful and spoke great english - all our special requests were met. The hotel has a nice bar and restaurant with good food. The rooftop bar was cool and well attended. Our only gripe was that the metro runs right below this hotel and you will feel and hear it no matter what floor you are on. Even if you sleep with earplugs (like us), you will still feel the vibrations of the metro and it takes some getting used to. Fortunately, we were so tired every night from so much incredible sightseeing that we passed out and generally did not notice the trains rumbling below.", "Date": "November 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel in a great location!\u201d", "Author": "Jenn478", "ReviewID": "UR10988793", "Content": "We stayed here one night after our cruise.

However my main complaint is the beds - they were wobbly/saggy - not the standard of firm, luxuriant beds (e.g.Westin) you'd expect of a hotel of this cool, minimalist profile - and not what you'd expect of a hotel that charges 180 euros plus per night. I slept on floor 2 of the nights as I couldn't bear the lack of support in the bed. This does not add to the pleasure of your holiday. Also the hotel generally lacks any warmth or character - an anonymous experience; staff don't give you much, it's all a bit sterile.

As I said, I booked the hotel through their website, and the website advises that you will get a confirmation email directly from the hotel. We never did, so I emailed them in February asking them to confirm. I never heard back. I emailed them again in March, and I never heard back. I emailed them again in April and finally, in May, I received an email confirming our reservation. Four weeks before our trip, I was checking reservations, and for some reason, our reservation number didn't show up on their website. I again emailed them asking what happened and asking them to please confirm. We heard NOTHING. In the space of 4 days, I emailed the hotel three times and the home office (Nunez Navarro) once and never got a response. Then, the reservation number showed up on the website again. Hmm. Thankfully, we did have a room when we got there. The good stuff: The front desk staff does speak English. . .some better than others. They checked us in immediately, and we went to our room on the 7th floor. The bedroom and bathroom were extremelly clean. I liked the fact that the floor was wood laminate so that it was very clean. Everything was spotless and in its place. I will say, however, that the furnishings are spartan. If you are used to the *new* beddings in American hotels, don't expect them here. While the beds were comfortable, they didn't have the fluffy mattress covers, fluffly pillows or the comforters so many hotels have now. These beds are flat with dowdy bedspreads and hard pillows on them. But, that being said, they were not that uncomfortable. The hotel's location is great. It's about a 5-minute walk from Placa Catalunya and the top of Las Ramblas, a block from Starbuck's, in the middle of a university/residential area. While you can feel the subway when it runs below the hotel, it's not really that bad. And, with the window (balcony door) closed, you won't hear the traffic and pedestrian noise. . .And, because we were there during Feste de la Merce, there were both kinds of traffic 24-hours a day. While the front desk personnel was polite, most of them didn't go out of their way to help with much. They didn't know anything about Feste happenings, and some of the information they gave us on banks, airport and restaurants was wrong.

The concierge gave 2 excellent restaurant reviews, including Patagonia steakhouse and the El Raco which was 2 minutes away, very unusual, tasty and well priced. All in all, it's usually worth asking, as their recommends were always better than our gos at finding somewhere to eat! Took the Bus Turistic for 2 days (only 23 Euros per person for 2 days, which was a bargain) and had some lovely strolls around the Barri Gotic and the areas around the hotel. The rooftop pool was also very nice, and we had some very peaceful afternoons up there (watch out for the bird scarer - scares the begeebies out of you first time!). On our fourth day, our afternoon by the pool was ruined by a large group of Brits who (as we have seen so many times before on holiday) acted like they owned the place, behaved very badly, were loud, drunk and did not attempt to control their children (one of whom threw a ball off the 9th floor onto the street below). It completely spoiled our afternoon, although we understand that this was not the fault of the hotel. As we were checking out, we noticed that a large British Hen Party were checking in, so we can only think that we timed that right.

All in all, we enjoyed this hotel very much - from the prime location, the comfortable bed, the linens and the helpfulness of the staff - in particular, Marien. I had actually double-booked a stay at another hotel (Hotel Majestic) for our post-cruise stay but was pleased with the Jazz that I cancelled my reservation at the Majestic. On the pre-cruise stay, we had a triple room on the 7th floor (Room 706) which consists of a large king bed and a fold-out sofa for the 3rd person. The swimming pool was on the 8th floor. We didn't notice any subway noise but heard noise from the street / traffic. The windows do not seem to do much to insulate the exterior sound. We live in a city and are therefore use to such sounds. On the post-cruise stay, we stayed in another triple which was located on the 6th Floor (Room 606). Of the 2 rooms, Room 606 was larger as it had a wall in between the king bed and the sofabed. Both rooms are on the southwest corner of the building so you had windows that opened up on two sides of the room. Air conditioning worked great - probably too well and it took some time to figure out how to adjust the temps. Don't know if it was because we were there longer, but we did hear the noise and the rumble of the subway in this room. Positives: Location, friendliness of the staff, the pool, usage of computer with internet access (front desk offered to print my boarding passes if I would only email it to them). Food ordered from the pool was fairly good and relatively inexpensive. 11 Euros for a large pizza and a liter of water. Negatives: Pool doesn't open until 10 a.m. and closes at 8 p.m. My wife would have liked to get in a morning or late night swim for exercise, but they lock the floor. Also, housekeeping didn't make our room until late in the afternoon (4 pm) even though we put out the sign for room clean up at 9 a.m. After a day of sightseeing, the last thing we want is to return to an unmade room or catch the housekeeper in the middle of her clean up. I think that she was concerned about cleaning up the rooms for guests who were departing so that the hotel could have them available for incoming guests instead of taking care of the other guests who were staying. It cost us 25 Euros for a taxi cab from the hotel to the airport at 5 a.m. (no traffic), but note the taxi adds another 2 Euros for each additional piece of luggage. We had previously booked a private car to pick us up from the airport to take us to the Hotel Jazz and that was $50 flat. If we did not anticipate that there was going to be little traffic at the time of the morning, we would probably book a private car as it would be cheaper and probably less stressful.

There are plenty of busses going to the Placa and they are easy to find, but don\u2019t bother with their automated curb-side ticket machines. None of them worked when we were there, creating long lines of frustrated customers. You can simply buy your ticket from the bus driver upon entry. We took a taxi on our way back to the hotel instead of taking the bus (around 30 euros with all the fees) because we simply didn\u2019t want to deal with dragging our suitcases through the mass of humanity at the Placa. Barcelona in August is crazy busy, like going to Mardi Gras in New Orleans. The hotel itself is clean, sleek and new, and just far enough from the Placa to provide a sense of refuge. The place used to be a bus station, making it an interesting and fun lay-out. The staff was helpful and gave us free maps. The University metro stop is right outside the hotel, and yes, you do hear the underground rumbling in your room which sounds like an elevator. I wore earplugs to counteract it and slept well. Frankly, the party girls in the hallways at all hours were a greater problem. ROOMS: We booked months ahead of time and got a lovely courtyard double room for only 105 euros, a great value for high season in Barcelona. Our beds were comfortable and the air conditioning worked well. Like others, we had issues with getting water all over the floor from the partially enclosed shower. My daughter had to blow-dry her hair in the bedroom because she was worried she\u2019d electrocute herself standing in the puddles of water. There is a drain in the floor outside the shower but it doesn\u2019t help much. We could have used more soaps, towels and tissue paper, but we got a nice supply of razors, toothbrushes, etc. BREAKFAST: We ate the 15 euro breakfast most days as it was too good, fast and convenient to pass up. You can also watch German MTV while you\u2019re eating with all the international travelers and their families in the breakfast room. POOL: A happy place. You can order up food and lay in the sun while looking at the view (and the occasional topless sunbather). INTERNET: There are two Internet computers next to the bar, but the rooms themselves offer excellent free wireless. ROOM SERVICE: If you\u2019re feeling overdone by all the Spanish ham and heavy meats, order up the vegetarian pizza. Delicious.

The great design was modern but not cold or hard and the rooms were just the right size. The location was great, ideal for the Aerobus from the airport which is only 4euros for a single trip and it drops you literally around the corner from the hotel. If you head down towards the port there is La Rambla and the Barri Gotic area - if you head up the street, its the main shopping district - all chic designer shops. There are loads of cafes around, and a few shops (Zara, Mango, even Topshop!) literally on the doorstep to the hotel. We didn't want to pay 14euros or whatever the price was for breakfast, I think that was the only down point - we couldn't find anywhere nice to have breakfast, so ended up having it at Starbucks! (There are at least 4 starbucks within 10 mins of the hotel!) And there is free internet access 24 hours in the bar area - the bar is again, great modern decor, but maybe a little pricey (but you get free crisps with your drinks!). The pool area was just great - most people seemed to go sightseeing during the best part of the day, then come back to the hotel around 3.30/4pm to chill out by the pool. We found if you get to the pool around 2.30/3ish you basically have the poolside to yourself, but if you go later around 4, you might struggle to find a sunbed. They also provide towels around the pool, but sometimes they run out later in the day. Its really clean, and the views are great! I think the only downside about the pool was there wasn't enough shade - the umbrellas they had (only about 3!) often couldn't go up because of the strong breeze. There is also the really loud bird sound over the tannoy every hour (which wakes you up if you're napping!) but it keeps the birds away - and it works! You can order food & drink from up there as well, the drinks were pricey (2euros for a coke) but the food was quite cheap. There were workmen working on the roof while we were there which was quite annoying but it was only for a couple of days. If you have a late flight, the check out time is a reasonable 12noon, and they are really good about letting you use their facilities, they have a lock up area for your bags, and you can use the pool & shower up by the pool for the rest of the afternoon. We ordered a taxi from the hotel back to the airport (having taken the Aerobus in) but they add a hotel surcharge for ordering you one - the taxi was pricey as well (nearly 40euros!!) but I think we got completely ripped off! The rooms and bathroom were a great size - and yes, you can hear the metro but its literally just like the rumble of a car going past - what can you expect in the middle of a city?! But otherwise the rooms were silent as can be and the air conditioning was heaven after coming in from sightseeing! The bathrooms were really clean and again, modern decor - felt like luxury! In terms of food - I would recommend you book a few nights ahead for restaurants or else you might end up waiting an hour for a table - even during the week. Also some of the restaurants I can recommend around Barcelona are: La Crema Canela - you HAVE to try this restaurant, its just off the Placa Reial - people were queuing to get into this posh restaurant on the square, but if you go around the corner this was so much better, its so cheap and absolutely beautiful interior and the food is so tasty! El Gran Cafe - situated in a back street in the Barri Gothic area, 1920s interior, a bit more pricey but fantastic food. NOTI Restaurant - If you are looking for a posh, luxury restaurant, I would come here - it was my boyfriends birthday so I wanted to take him somewhere special. It was a lovely atmosphere and the food was amazing!

Also, if you like outside air, the windows open (good only if you have an inner courtyard room due to street traffic). In summary I got a good nights rest every night. Add to that competent and friendly staff, designer rooms, a great location (close to the airport bus drop-off/a short 3 min walk to both La Ramblas and the not- so-touristy shopping and eating district to the northwest) and a roof top pool area that gives you a wonderful break after a day touring.

Having heard that city centre hotels are not as clean as those on the outskirts, I was a bit wary but I needn't have worried! The staff are friendly and helpful. Check-in was swift and hassle-free. It literally took us 5 minutes to check-in. Maid service was excellent. The hotel is spotlessly clean with modern decor and I have no complaints at all about the room or en suite. My only 'whinges' (which is an overstatement) are: (1) The pool is on the small side and rather shallow. (2) The rumbling noise which the lift makes - this may not be heard from other rooms situated away from the lift. All in all, our stay here was extremely pleasant and the location is excellent too - about 1-2 minute walk to Placa de Catalunya and the same to La Rambla. I would recommend restaurants in the Barri Gotic and the squares just off La Rambla also. Look out for Les Quinze Nits (found in a large square off La Rambla) - cheap and yummy food. We were particularly curious when we saw a huge queue of people stretching across the square! La Taller de Tapas is fantastic for tapas with lots of coverage in newspaper articles. You can take the Aerobus from La Placa de Catalunya to and from the airport costing 4 euros max which takes about 40 minutes but the queues can be long. If you take the taxi option, it will set you back around 20-30 euros depending on how much luggage you have. I would also recommend going on the Bus Turistic to do your tourist sight-seeing.

The pool on the roof is a nice addition although only used it once, the water was a bit too cold in May but nice place to unwind and catch some sun after a days sight seeing. Barcelona is probably the best city i have been to and i am quite well traveled, it is a very lively place with lots to see and do but laid back at the same time. A must is the open top tourist bus service, 19 euros for 1 day or 23euros for 2 days, there are 3 different routes which stop at all the main tourist sites and you can get on and off as many times as you want, there is a bus every 5 mins or so, it is an ideal way to see the city without missing lots of it by using the underground system (which is very good) and a lot cheaper than getting taxis everywhere. A must is a visit to the sagrada familia, which is absolutly out of this world.

The 1898, same group, on Las Ramblas is also good. The Pittari down near the Colombus statue and Quo Vadis near the back of the theatre off Las Ramblas were two really good ones. Don't get there much before 10pm though. Nono close to the blue Gaudi extravaganza is great for a long Sunday lunch, the staff are knowledgeable and interested in their food. Tapa tapa just across the road was the best tapas we have had, and we have lived in Spain for almost 3 years! Just don't plan to eat later as you will be too full. Both Gaudi apartments are worth doing the tour of, just stunning. Make another trip there at night to really appreciate the architecture and detail. If you like those then make sure that you don't miss the music palace behind the old cathedral in the gothic quarter. A visual feast!

The Hotel Jazz is a perfect place to stay - in fact I couldnt fault it in any way!! I have staying in many 5 star hotels, including the Bellagio in Las Vegas just a couple of months ago, and the Hotel Jazz was of equal standards and comfort. The staff are efficient but also friendly and speak good English. Upon arrival we took the blue Aerobus from outside the airport terminal and got off at the Placa de Cataluyna (cost 3.75 euros each) - the hotel is a quick 5 minute walk away down the Pelei but the entrance is just off the main street (we walked past it without realising at first). Although we arrived at 1030, we were able to get into our room immediately. Our room was on the 5th floor and only felt slight rumble from the underground which wasnt a problem. The windows must be triple glazed because we didnt hear any traffic noise when they were closed. Just a couple of tips in relation to eating out ; the hotel charges 14 euro each for breakfast if not included in your package - we visited a local bakery a couple of blocks away for our breakfast which cost 7 euros for both of us and a small supermarket which is in the straight that runs next to the Cafe D'Or. Previously people on tripadvisor recommended Cafe D'Or for breakfast and dinner - we ate tapas there and it was cold and quite horrible so really disppointed, but the staff were friendly enough. The main restaurant you must visit is Les Quinze Nits in Reial Square ( about half way down Las Ramblas on the left hand side) for quality and very reasonably priced food - it opens for dinner at 2030 and when we arrived at 2020 there was a huge queue of about 100 people!! - we didnt think we would get in but did - we sat outside which was a bit nippy but kept our jackets on. Although I had kept hold of my bag with the tightest of grips for the entire trip I lost my concentration momentarily and hung my bag on the back of my chair. I was promptly spoken to by the security chap at the restaurant to hide my bag away which I did. We also ate at the Hard Rock Cafe for a non-Spanish meal and it had a great atmosphere and good food. For great views of the city, take the smallest lift in the world !!! up the Columbus tower which is located at the bottom of Las Ramblas - however, warning its not for those who are claustrophic or dislike heights. For tours round the city we took the orange Barcelona Tours bus - they arent marketed as much as the other bus company but they are better as you get headphones for the tour which you can select for your language - instead of hearing the same thing being said 5 times over in different languages!! - it took us to all the main sights and we could get off and on as much as we wished. We were really aware of our bags so thankfully didnt get anything stolen, but there is quite a strong presence of police in the Las Ramblas area. We loved Barcelona and will definately be returning!

We had requested the sixth floor or higher based on previous reviews and found it waiting for us when we arrived. Though you could hear some rumbling from the subway below, it was nothing distracting at all. The location of the hotel was excellent- literally down the street from Las Ramblas and 2 blocks from Placa Catalunya. All of the perks of a downtown hotel without the noise and chaos. We always felt safe walking back to the hotel at night as well. Now, the pool was the main reason we booked here and we again were not disappointed! It had great views of the city from the top floor, had lots of tables, chairs and loungers, and refreshing water. The pool is not heated so it is not an issue in the summer and is only about 4.5 ft deep so it is meant mainly for dipping. We found that if you wanted to lie by the pool, you needed to be back to the hotel by about 2pm or your would have more trouble getting a chair. People seemed to head back for that time. Again, in an area of 4 star hotels with so much to do this hotel is great for the money and experience. I would highly recommend it to anyone! If you have some time to spend in Barcelona and have heard of Salvador Dali, i recommend purchasing the \"Figures and Girona Dali Tour\" through Expedia. The bus picks you up in Placa Catalunya and is a great way to spend the day. Girona is a walled city (medieval church and all) and we were pleasantly surprised by how lovely it was.

I booked us this hotel for three reasons: Convenient location, stylish and thoughtful presentation and expectations of good service at a new hotel (it only four years old). We were not disappointed -- at $160 ($125 euros) per night per room, we could have gone to a less expensive hotel. But we were pleased with the service, the cleanliness and the rooms themselves. The pool on the roof is small but the view, while not spectacular, is still worth heading up for. My wife was especially impressed by the quietest AC system we'd ever had in a hotel room anywhere. Jazz Hotel is a block from Plaza Catalunya and the Ramblas, and there is a very good Tapas restaurant (D'Or Restaurant) across the street, which we went to, on a recommendation from a Tripadvisor post, on the first night. The beer on tap there is great, and I suggest you ask Felipe, the waiter in the back of the place, to serve you a tapas sampler. Really great. Americans and Anglos generally will like Hotel Jazz for its capable service -- all desk people spoke English well -- and the easy access to everything. After reading this site I was concerned prior to our visit that the tremble of the subway would keep us up after our long trip to Barcelona. We definitely felt the rumble a couple of times -- we were all on the fourth floor -- but it didn't wake me up from sound sleeps, and generally did not detract from the experience. I think those posting complaints about the subway rumble must have been on the lowest floor (3rd) or were hypersensistive. I highly recommend this hotel for a two or three-day stay in Barcelona, especially if you plan to eat out, as we did.

Conveniently, since we were all meeting from different parts of the US, the staff put all of us on the 7th floor, which was both quiet and comforable. The rooms were great, large by European standards, very clean, lots of toiletries if you forgot anything and great bedding (we asked for a King when we booked and although it was 2 singles pushed together, it was a big improvement over many European doubles we have had before) . My one complaint would be that with the design of the 1/4 glass door on the showers, it is impossible not to get the floor wet when you take a shower. The breakfast buffet was great, but a little expensive at 14 Euros. The staff at the front desk were all very helpful and all spoke English (this was not true at the hotel my in-laws stayed at down the street - where language was a definite problem). They helped us with touring suggestions, maps, taxis, restaurant suggestions and reservations. The one suggestion that we were disappointed in was for a restaurant on the waterfront, (it think it was \"Posit\" or something like that). It was the most expensive meal of the entire trip and probably the worst food, although the location was nice. To give the desk clerk his due, he did say that he had never eaten there so he was going by the fact that we asked for seafood and a waterfront location. All of their other suggestions were very good. For lunch one day they suggested \"3 Frogs\" (I think) and the inexpensive 3 course lunch was great! The hotel's location is excellant for touring - there is a bus stop right around the corner for the red and blue buses, which are a great way to see the ciy and stop at all the \"sites\". It is an easy walk to Placa de Catalunya and Las Ramblas. And at the end of a hot day of touring, a dip in the small (but clean) rooftop pool was a nice treat.

We had a room on the 3rd floor, and despite arriving at 9:30am we were checked into our room immediately and made to feel incedibly welcome. Yes, we heard the Metro trains on occasions but this certainly didn't interupt or spoil our stay - in fact I would say it was the one reminder that you're in a city hotel - and as we wanted a city break, that wasn't an issue for us. The roof top pool and terrace were absolutely A1 - and the friendly bar staff would take orders for drinks and snacks from the convenient telephone on the sun deck and bring them up to you either by the pool or on the deck itself - just excellent service. The complimentary internet access and willingness to store our luggage on the last day (we had an evening flight) were nice touches which made the stay all the more memorable. The best highlight though without doubt is the great bar on the 1st floor of the hotel. Often hotel bars are stuffy places where you want to get out ASAP, but this is not the case at the Jazz. The bar staff were very friendly, offering suggestions on good places to visit and being attentive without being pushy. In particular, Donato - an Italian guy who works behind the bar there - was very friendly - ask for him, and his 'Donato Special' drink - guaranteed to give you a fat head in the morning! Local resturants and bars are excellent too - try the 'Cafe D'or' which is opposite the Jazz and serves brilliant snacks, it's a great breakfast haunt. They also offer the local beer by the Damm - I made that mistake only once, a Damm is apparently a litre!! We also liked the Carusso resturant on La Rambla, which had excellent food and brilliant Sangria. All in all, loved Barcelona, loved the Jazz and certainly wouldn't stay anywhere else.

The views were unbelieveable and the doors opened to a quaint balcony on both sides of our corner suite.

Coming from California, I sense when there's an earthquake and this is what it felt like. After the first night, we asked if it might make a difference if we moved to an upper floor, and the front desk said they would try but the hotel was fully booked. Not sure it would have made a difference. The front staff assured us the Metro ran until 12 midnight, but I was kept up until 1:30 am, and woken up at 5 am again when trains started running again. Needless to say, I slept very badly on the both nights despite a full day of exploring the City. Don't know why the structure of the building did not insulated itself against the underground -- I have lived in NYC with many subways below my office or apt. The hotel itself is luxurious and rooms comfy for the 150 euros we paid, but not worth the annoyance of hearing the trains. Not sure why none of the other reviews we saw on traveladvisor.com did not mention the Metro noise. Was everyone else on a higher floor than us on the 3rd?

Go between 6 and 7pm when the crowds have thinned. Palau de Musica Catalan: indoor architectural tour of the stunning concert hall. Great cafe with pintxos, brushetta-like snacks with all sorts of toppings. Eating: Cafe L'Opera, La Rambla: where Picasso had his coffee :-) Churros con xocolata is the highlight. Cal Pep, Placa de las Olles: tapas bar where the line starts before doors open at 8pm, no menu, waiter orders for you but you may tell him to stop serving or your bill will surprise you. Origen, Passiage de Born: real Catalan homestyle cooking, magazine like menu with 5 pages of desserts before all other menu items!

Our taxi driver had no probelm in finding the hotel and the taxi fare from the airport cost 25 euros including a tip, we arrived at 5:30pm so also had to contend with evening traffic on a Friday.

It is in a safe, central and convenient location right by everything. The hotel itself is very trendy, bright and immaculately clean. A bit on the smaller side, like most European hotels but we didn't mind at all as it was a very comfortable stay. Full amenities and wonderful service was provided as the staff were friendly, professional and helpful. We liked the free internet terminals on the 2nd floor by the bar which was handy. We had dinner at the tapas bar across the street on Pelai, Cafe D'or, and found to our delight our meal was quite tasty and would highly recommend. In the morning, we walked over to La Rambla, the main street where there are alot of shops and street performers and that was only 10 min. away from our hotel. Make sure you check out Barrio Gotic while you're in the area - very cool. We checked out the rooftop pool and it seemed really nice but unfortunately, we did not have a chance to try it. If we had to find one fault of this place, we would only recommend trying to get a room on the higher floor as the street traffic can be a slight hum on the 2nd floor (where we stayed).

A few things that you may want to know: While checking in/out, Keep your valuables with you and notice your surrundings. When we checked in, someone stole a bag with jewlery from another couple with a child at the lobby, and even though the thief was cought on the security video, the victims had to waste five hours at the police station filling forms, etc.. In Barcelona and throughout Europe, keep your valulable with you at all times, no matter how safe the place looks. Keep panhandlers at least three feet away from you. One last thing, the cab driver from the port to the hotel tried to pull a fast one on me, so please, pay ONLY WHAT THE METER SHOWS.

The hotel staff were incredibly helpful - even sending several people calling about and running into the street to flag down a large cab for four people plus cruise luggage. Warning - if you are traveling with a lot of baggage or a big party, expect to have trouble getting a cab that can accomodate you. We had to take separate cabs on several occasions while in Barcelona. The hotel was spotlessly clean and even rather chic. Didn't use the pool - no time. The rooms had well stocked minibars and even had flat screen tvs. Beds were comfortable although I probably would not have noticed if they were not since we were all so tired. We did get personal attention at this small hotel which was a great change from the big chains. They recommended a great and reasonably priced restauranct for dinner although I can't remember the name of the place. We even met some very nice people from the UK in the lobby. I guess I do have one tiny complaint because we only got one bar of soap for use between the shower and the sink. I found this to be true at several hotels throughout Europe though.

We had two nights before our cruise and one night after. On our pre-cruise nights, we were on the 6th floor. Our room faced the courtyard. I could hear a faint rumble of the metro below, but I found it amusing and no trouble at all. It was quiet the first night, but the second night, there was a band playing in the hotel and they didn't stop until 6:00am. So, we finally fell asleep, but then woke up late and had to rush to get out and get to the cruise ship. The room was impeccably clean. The hotel maids work so hard to make sure each room is absolutely spotless. I did not like the shower. Whomever designed them did a poor job. The glass screen doesn't cover enough and the bathroom gets all wet. On our post cruise stay, we were allowed to check in early. I forgot the cruise ship boots you off by 9:00am and with no place to go with our luggage we headed over to the Jazz. We got lucky and they were able to check us in early. However, this time we were on the second floor. The metro rumble is a little louder and we also had a window facing the street. It was a bit noisier at this location, but what really bothered me, was a sound like someone above us was dragging a chair across the floor all night. It continued until 3:00am. One last word on the rooms....they are really small. I understand that by European Standards, it is supposed to be considered large, but my cabin onboard the ship was larger as well as my master bedroom bathroom back home. On the roof top, they do have a nice pool. I didn't swim, but many people were using the lounge chairs for sun. There is also plenty of room up there along with tables, chairs and umbrellas to bring a meal from one of the local restaurants and dine alfresco. We enjoyed doing this twice. A nice plus was the free internet on the 1st floor by the bar. I could get on most anytime I wanted and was able to keep in touch with my daughter back home. Over all, it was a decent hotel. Most are noisy anyway. But this place is clean as can be and close to everything. So, your location couldn't be any better. I do have to complain about the price. This hotel cost us 203Euro a night, which I think is steep for a tiny room in a 3 star hotel. The mini-bar had outrageous prices too. A tiny bottle of orange juice was 3Euro. We bought 2 bottles at Starbucks across the street for 3Euro. That's half the price! Would I stay here again???

The reception staff are wonderful, always willing to discuss were to visit, what restaurants might be of interest and they don't just direct you to touristy restaurants they share with you where they go to eat and relax. Location is wonderful the street into Placa de Catalunya is lined with shoe shops and the walk takes five minutes and its a very safe area even if you are two girls travelling alone as my friend and I were. The pool is great after a hot shopping spree and it is warm enough to use now as we were grateful to cool down on Sunday afternoon. Universitat subway is two mins away and the subways are clean and easy to use. The tube staff are really helpful too! If you are going to make a few trips together get one book of ten tickets and share it. But note it is really hot down in the underground even in the evenings so you might like to walk especially as most restaurants are in easy reach and everyone is out and about too. We went to Rubi Supper Club in Banys Vells off Carrer de la princesa - not huge menu choice modern fusion theme - nice quality though in a relaxed bar atmosphere. Really good cocktails and not too noisy if you get there eary - about nine o'clock. There's a new restaurant in Carrer de la Argenteria called Cheeseme which we went to and this was also good. The restaurant looks out on a little Plaza so it is a great place to people watch as there are a couple of tapas establishments and a bar off the square. Best tapas bar was the one round the corner from the hotel in Placa de la Univesitat but can't recall it's name but reception will direct you. Very good for your first night meal as you get your bearings. Packing - bring comfortable shoes as you will walk lots and lots. The Gothis quarter and El Born are a wonderful maze of little streets with tiny boutiques and speciality food shops.

That said the hotel itself was very comfortable to stay in. The rooms were kept very clean and the decor was very modern. We loved the bathroom and the flat screen television which kept us up to date with the News and the odd Football game! (Barcelona played twice in the week we were there!). We spent a couple of days lying round the rooftop pool but did not take a dip as it is unheated so was a bit too fresh for our liking. Weather was great though. The menu for food at the hotel was very limited so room service was a definite no. We had breakfast twice but at 14 euros each it was too pricey for every day but there was a nice variety to choose from. As both of us are Vegetarian we found a few nice restuarants that catered for us, but be warned most restaurants don't open until 8 -8:30 pm unless on the Ramblas. We highly recommend FresCo a self service all you can eat salad bar ( turn right and right again out of the hotel and its on the left side of the road along a few hundred yards) brilliant value for money as there is pizza and pasta and ice cream and fruit all in the price. Juicey Jones we came across when taking a walk - very colourful decor!!! had a nice set meal deal and is predominantly a juice bar but the food was very nice. Bio Centre - four courses for a set price so go when hungry and you won't be disappointed. We also ate at Roissy - a restaurant with Medieval decor but very tasty and filling meals. L'Hortet - again lovely restaurant pretty blue lights in the window and food freshly made to order. We highly recommend taking a stroll along the ramblas as there are loads of shops and the street artists are worth giving a euro or two too as although many are of the painted statue variety there are a few that react to a coin tossed into their bucket with a mini performance - quirky and fun.

The fridge didn't work and it couldn't be fixed 2. The hot water system broke down on our final night so we couldn't shower before we left. The receptionist made no reference or an apology when we checked out. 3. The barman (in the very small but attractive bar) kept disappearing for over 10 minutes. This led to some other guests to help themselves! 4. Some receptionists were very helpful but others couldn't be bothered.

On a separate note and based on personal experience - PLEASE take care when walking around Barcelona - don't carry your passport around and beware of bag snatchers - I would suggest you take out only the cash you need with you, keep passports and anything else you don't need locked in the room safe. Ideally use a money belt and carry bags securely across your body, preferably under your coat. Whilst walking to the (excellent) Picasso Museum my mother was targeted by a bag snatcher - luckily he didn't get her bag but only because she yelled and yelled and I rushed to her assistance. Just be careful!!! Also beware the women selling carnations - do not get your purse out, be firm and just walk around them - do not let them stop you. Be firm and rude if necessary.

Everything was within walking distance - La Rambla; the shee-shee shops along Passeig de Gracia where you can also see Gaudi's Casa Battlo and La Pedrera - there's an H &M store as well (its a popular chain of clothing stores in Europe, in case some of you have never heard of it and may be getting it confused for something else); the mega mall Corte Ingles which has a grocery store in the basement for your bottled water needs and much more; Starbucks (though you can get a yummy cup of coffee anywhere in Barcelona); lots of apparel and shoe shops; and for anyone that's interested in booking a guided bus tour - the Julia Bus Terminal is directly across the street. This was an awesome surprise since I booked the tours online thinking we'd probably have to walk a bit or take a bus to get there, but nope - it was just a 30-second walk out of the hotel lobby! We took two guided half-day tours of Barcelona on different days - Morning Classical and Afternoon Artistic and they were both good.

The bathroom was nice, new, sparkling and clean which was a plus, as I am a cleanfreak.

Each time we called it seemed as though someone just got one 20 minutes ago and we were out of luck. So be sure to bring your own adapters.

We paid about 110 Euro for a standard room. Based on previous posts we requested and got a higher floor room on the 6th floor. The front desk was very accomodating given our unexpected late arrival due to a delayed flight from France. One drawback was that they were unable to provide a luggage cart for our 6 bags, so we ended up taking two trips up and down to get everything into the room. We heard very little street noise and definitely no impact from the rumbling of the metro that we read about. We did hear quite a bit of noise from the hallway, but it was quiet at night. Also, the curtains in the room are incredible. They blocked almost all the light!! The room was very nice, we did have a king bed, which was actually two twins pushed together. I would rate this just ok. The bed was adequate, we could sleep, but nothing to rave about. We took advantage of the wireless Internet. It was very very easy to use and very helpful to us. Also English speaking news stations were great, particularly CNBC Europe. The bathroom was fantastic. Fresh towels and toiletries every day, which was great. Toiletries were great, razor kit (husband forgot to pack a razor), toothbrush, sewing kit, shampoos, soaps, etc. The rooftop pool is smaller, but wonderful. A great way to start the day with relaxation or to unwind after a long day. It was crowded sometimes, but we always managed to get a chair. Also, the tables were great, we bought sandwiches a few days and just ate them up there, which was nice. The hotel location is awesome, very centralized and easy to get just about anywhere in the city. We had lunch one day at d'Or across the street. It was great. Also, I don't speak Spanish at all and thrive on coffee, so was pleased to find a nearby Starbucks.....I know I know, but it was good for me. The front desk was not good with recommendations for where to buy some bottled water, etc. but we found the Champions grocery on the rambla which was a great solution for water and wine to keep in the room. They were very helpful though in making reservations at local restaurants we wanted to try and navigating the metro. They also gave some interesting recommendations for walks around the city that were not on the map. I definitely recommend going to dinner one night at La Venta in the Tibidabo area of the city.

He is friendly and helpful when he's there but that's hardly the point.

Also good, for tapas, is Celler de Tapas (I think that's what it was called) just around the corner on the Pl. Universitat.

Its nice and quiet, didnt really notice the metro rumble till my last day, and only when i was in the bathroom. The pool is tiny! i never had the chance to swim in it but it looks much bigger in photos but a guesstimate would put it at approx 4m by 2.5m(being generous here) Comparing this to the Vincci Maritimo Barcelona which i stayed in previously, i still prefer it to the Jazz as the hotel room was much larger and bathroom was much better shame about its location though.

The hotel is fantastic. Great location, a few minutes walk from Placa de Catalunya where you can either head down Las Ramblas or head up Paseig de Gracia. Rooms were beautiful, chocolate brown walls, wooden floors, state of the art bathroom. If you can get a reasonable price for this hotel, then definitely book it. The staff were not that great though. They were unable to answer most of my questions. When I asked if they knew where a certain street was, they just shrugged and pushed a map in front of me. It turns out the street was only 2 blocks away. Don't rely on them for dining recommendations - best to go explore for yourself, there are lots of good restaurants nearby. We would definitely stay here again -but make sure you ask for a high floor, as even on the 5th floor you can still hear the rumble of the metro below. Also, before we went I was rather concerned about safety, but we encountered no problems at all.. we kept our money in our front pockets, only took what we needed and kept an eye on our surroundings at all times. You will see plenty of tourists there who take no precautions and will be much easier targets for the crooks.

The Jazz is ideally situated close to the centre of Barcelona minutes away from the top of Las Rambla and the Placa De Catalunya where the airport Aerobus drops and collects you. We never used the bar or restaurant in the hotel so can't comment, but they looked ok. I think because just stepping out the door you found dozens of bars and restaurants the Jazz facilities are rarely used. Step out the Jazz and turn left and in front of you is the bar D'or which is great and is open long hours, but just one word of warning, if they offer you a large beer decline, or you will get an enormous glass containing approx 1.2 lit.

I am writing this review from one of the free internet stations in the Jazz Bar. You can even print things out free of charge. With regard to the noise that others have mentioned. We are on the seventh floor. You *can* hear a slight rumble, but it is not really intrusive and certainly did not prevent us from having a good nights sleep. However, I can imagine that if you were on a lower floor possibly you may hear the noise more. To get past this, ask for a room on the seventh floor! The staff are very friendly and professional.

The first time I stayed there just after the hotel opened, we were on an upper floor and had no problems with noise, though one could hear muffled street sounds in the background. The second (and probably last) time I stayed there, I was on the second (lowest) floor, and the metro was hugely bothersome and impossible to ignore. I could feel the vibrations in the walls!!

It is a very nice hotel, very trendy. The people at the reception were nice, I asked for a room on the top floor because I had read some reviews and it mentioned the noise sometimes. The receptionist immediately called the cleaning personnel and they arranged a room for us on the 7th floor, the highest you can get! The room was really fantastic, a huge bed, flatscreen tv, a fully equiped bathroom (Bath, toilet, bidet, towel warmer, shampoo, soap, shower gel, a comb, tissues, razor, toothbrush, toothpaste,...). No noise, only in the far far distance, you could hear some cars and sometimes the metro. I can imagine that it would be disturbing if you were sleeping on the 1st floor. We did not try the breakfast. The swimming pool was empty, which is quite normal in february. The weather was really nice though, but 15 degrees is a little bit too cold to go for a swim outside! The hotel is very well situated! A 3 minute walk to Plaza Catalu\u00f1a, which is really the place to be if you are a tourist! 0.5 minute walk to Plaza Universitat, 4 minute walk to Las Ramblas! I think the best thing to do is to take the bus A1 to Plaza Catalu\u00f1a at the airport and step off at Plaza Universitat, which I think is the 3rd stop. It takes about 20 minutes to get to Plaza Universitat. It's 3,60 \u20ac per person. We took a taxi to get back to the airport, which takes about 10 minutes and it was 17 \u20ac, which is not bad either. Tip: on Plaza Catalu\u00f1a, you can find the biggest information center in Barcelona, it is under the Plaza Catalu\u00f1a. There are 3 types of tour busses that you can take: * red bus: drives you through the north of Barcelona, with several stops at the most important things to see. * blue bus: this one takes you through the south of Barcelona both are 16 \u20ac per person/day * orange bus: we took this one and it was really great, it takes you to the most important places to see in the entire city (so both north and south), they give you a free pair of headsets so that you can listen to some historical information in the language of your choise. This one was 17 \u20ac per day/person and I would really recommend this one. Nobody seemed to have noticed that for only 1 \u20ac more, this bus takes you to both north and south, as there was a long queue for the red and blue busses and no queue for the orange one. You can hop on and hop off wherever you want, whenever you want (the bus comes every 20 minutes). Be prepared that Barcelona is quite an expensive city and the people of Barcelona don't seem to be able to speak english. If you speak english, they answer in spanish and quite rude. But as soon as you start speaking spanish, they are lovely.
