All staff were very friendly especially the older man on reception who was a real comedian, everybody who worked in the Hotel were very polite and couldn't do enough for us. Room was huge with 2 queen size beds and had a flatscreen tv, bathroom was large with an adequate shower, (similar to those that you get on cruise boats) so not a problem.

The bathroom was a decent size as well however the shower was compact. The morning of check-out the hotel held our luggage so we could walk around the city and not have to carry it around.

The breakfast is situated on the fourth floor and is very good with bagels/croissants/muffins/doughnuts and sugary pastries every morning served with cream cheese and jam. There is a 24 hr serve yourself coffee machine serving Starbucks coffee and chocolate with tea and fresh milk available also. Staff are very helpful espec the concierge. The one thing I would say is having read previous reviews when approaching the hotel on broadway from herald square you do feel very vulnerable but nothing happened and we were fine. The building opposite has a nightclub on it's roof so on a fri and sat night there are a lot of people around from that. When you approach the building from 6th you do get a different feel much less intimidating.

The smallest shower I have ever used. The room is noisy for two reasons, the window was facing the back alley and was near some big industrial unit that was noisy, plus the street noise from the Broadway. The most annoying was the noise from the water pipes, if somebody next door was using their bathroom the noise in the room was loud. Continental breakfast was a joke. They provide bagels and something that looks like Philadelphia cheese. There are croissants and cupcakes as well. The coffee and orange juice taste awful. So, forget about the breakfast and go grab a nice one outside. Overall, this place feels like a better hostel and not a 4 star hotel.

The Breakfast Room was too small but we used the tray in our room to collect our breakfast and took it back to our room, which many guests seemed to do. Choice consisted of Bagels, pastries, doughnuts etc with tea, coffee and orange. The tea and coffee was available all day which was great. There was also a vending machine on one of the floors which was useful. Location - we felt that the location was great and very close to the Midtown attractions including Times Square, ESB, Fifth Avenue shops etc. We walked up to Central Park but did use the metro to go to the downtown area. There is a subway station close by on 28th St and really easy to use. There is a ticket machine at the subway on 28th St. We also got a cab to take us to Battery Park on the South of Manhattan, cost us $20 including tip and hailed cab from right outside the hotel no problem. The area around the hotel looks shabby at night because the shops are closed and the shutters are pulled down but in the day it was fine. Saying that we didn't feel unsafe at night even when we walked back from a show on Broadway. Although I wouldn't want to walk alone in the area around the hotel. We saw Mary Poppins on Broadway which was a great show - we bought tickets using the TCKT Booth in Times Square, queued for about 1 hour but was worth it as we got 50% off and paid around $60 per ticket.

There is only one lift (elevator) for 8th to the 13th floors, and sometimes it can get very crowded, with stops on almost all floors - not for the impatient! The good things were, my room had a great view of The Empire State Building. The customer service was excellent. The maids are very polite. Lots of good quality towels in the bathroom. Very close to the subway station, and if you prefer walking, then you can walk to Times Square in only 15 minutes.

The hotel lobby is small, but very nice and clean. The staff is excellent- very polite and willing to help. The only annoyance is waiting for elevators- there are only two to service the 13 floors, but it's manageable. Our room was clean and decent size- we packed 4 adults in the room. Very clean, though there was one creepy thing- two small child handprints on the back side of the bathroom door. Creepy, but I'd deal with a lot of weird handprints to save some serious cash (especially with the cost of dining in NYC!). The breakfast was an excellent perk- I recommend getting there early if you want a seat, it's pretty small. Sweet rolls, bagels, donuts, coffee, tea, milk, juice. Very nice- saves you the cost of breakfast in this phenomenally expensive city. The location of the hotel was mostly good- about 10 steps from the subway station (28th street). Very easy to hop on and head downtown to Chinatown, SoHo, Ground Zero. It was just a tad sketchy of an area-- weird stores in the immediate vicinity, selling wigs and all sorts of bizarre crap. Someone said it was a West African neighborhood. A little strange also because everything seemed to close up around 7pm- though this was the city that never sleeps? Guess not in this part of midtown. Just head down to 23rd/5th ave and you're back in civilization. Side note for all you budget travelers-- there is an EXCELLENT diner on 23rd, almost to 7th avenue- next to some lobster place called Malibu Diner. Typical Greek diner with great food and INCREDIBLE prices (pretty much the same as we pay here in the suburbs of Chicago for a meal). Great, great place. Found it the last night we were there- such a bummer! Just a 15 minute or so walk from the hotel. Final thought- do not take the car service they offer at the hotel. They charge $50 to go to LGA (though you don't have to tip). You can easily take a cab (as long as you're not traveling during rush hour) for $40 including tip.

This is a good hotel with large, clean rooms, is quite reasonably priced (for NYC) and a helpful staff that is convenient to several subway lines. Definitely a good value for the money. We had a room on the second floor, so we didn't have a great view that others have mentioned, and while that would have been nice, it wasn't a big deal. The room was quite spacious with two queen beds, a dresser/TV combo type thingy, a desk and a small table. The room was very clean and while the carpet seemed a little old it wasn't gross or disgusting. There were a few oddities to the room. I'm not sure if this was an old office building, but there was a set of fluorescent tube lights in the ceiling of our room (right as you walked in) and the ceiling tiles seemed as if they should be in an office building. The type of tiles didn't lead to it being noisy, though. The exception was in the bathroom - I could hear the hair dryer from another room somewhere one morning although that was coming through the air vent. Another oddity as far as the room goes: we could hear the subway (N-R-W trains) as it went below the building down Broadway. It wasn't distracting or bothersome, but you could definitely hear it, especially in the bathroom. The room was large, comfortable, clean and gave the four of us enough space. The breakfast was OK - a typical continental breakfast of bagels/cream cheese, doughnuts, some danish and juice. Since it's included in the price of the room, it's enough to get you going and keep you going until lunch. Two mornings we got there a little late and there wasn't anything left, so if you're going, go early. Thankfully in NYC there's always a street vendor nearby to get breakfast from cheaply if the food is gone. The staff was helpful as well. The doorman was able to set us up with a car service to LaGuardia for our return trip as well as answer questions about things in the area. The folks at the front desk were quick to check us in and out and when we called down they brought us extra pillows and a rollaway bed (my stepdaughters seemed to have trouble sharing a bed) promptly. The neighborhood is interesting - it is definitely not a touristy area. There are lots of little shops to sell you electronics, fashion accessories, etc. Some are wholesale, some not. I felt safe in the area, both daytime and nighttime. It does get very quiet at night, but even at 11:45 at night there were still a few people around. Just don't be a stupid tourist standing on the corner, counting your money, looking lost and/or waving your iPhone about (that behavior will find you trouble anywhere) and you'll be fine. There's also a little convenience store around the corner (27th street) called \"My Place Deli\" that's great for picking up snacks, bottles of water, etc. I didn't try the deli food so I can't comment on that. Several subways are close by. You can get the N-R-W trains at 28th and Broadway (a block from the hotel), you can catch the 6 train at 28th and Park Ave S. or the 1 train at 28th and 7th Ave. The last two you have to walk cross the avenues (east-west, not north-south) so they're a little further than the N-R-W trains but they're still easily walkable.

Keep in mind, this is not a luxury property; there is no travertine marble, rain showers or room service.

The staff could not have been more friendly or approachable...willing to help with any of our needs.

We arrived after 10pm, and at first I was disconcerted by the appearance - either side of the hotel's smart entrance - by dingy roller doors lining most of the street, giving the appearance of a down-market, 'low-rent' area. *** (Quite a different vista by day - when roller doors go up & shops window displays give a totally different perspective) However, we were met by a doorman, and our check-in was seamless - the room large & comfortable with a good sized bathroom. AND LOVELY FRESH, WHITE TOWELS. Every day our room was 'made up' - bed made, fresh towels and toiletries; it was quite humid in NYC at the time, so the very effective air conditioning was wonderful. The continental breakfast consisted of piles of bagels, doughnuts and pastries - fresh fruit provided (apples and oranges) juices and tea & coffee on the 4th floor dining area. ( Reminiscent of hostel style ) - and was quite satisfying. They also had an out sourced room service which was good for breakfasts, but did not supply all items listed for evening meals - but the burgers, chips and salad which were available - were delicious! My son & I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here... centrally located to all attractions and the service was seamless during our stay. The hotel can also arrange hotel to airport transport by car - I highly recommend this - for a set fee - it is a comfortable & affordable option (US $60 approx) - to taxis or a shuttle bus.

I would agree with what the other reviewers have said; it's not luxurious, but it is clean, has all the basic amenities, and is centrally located to the major sites. We arrived in NY in the morning, before check-in, so we visited a museum first thing. I arrived at the hotel at 2:30. Check-in is at 3, but having travelled extensively I had never had a problem checking in that close to the time. I was shocked when they told us that the room was not ready. The attendant at the front desk did offer a waiting area on the 4th floor to have tea or coffee. But I still found it surprising that they were not ready. When we did get to check-in we had trouble getting to our room, which was on the 13th floor. After asking one of the staff, we discovered that our room was the only room on the 13th floor and the only elevator that went that high was the service elevator! It was a little odd. The storage closets were right next to the room, so you could hear the staff going in and out for supplies and talking amongst themselves. As another reviewer had mentioned, the lights are florescent ceiling lights (like in an office). Our floors were all tile, no carpet! The thing that made up for this though was an absolutely fantastic view of the city. There was a perfect view of the Empire State Building. It was snowing as well and watching the clouds and snow whirl around the buildings was def. was one of the most memorable aspects of my trip. There was a good spread at the continental breakfast. I'd advise stopping in early. It opens at 7. I went at 7:20 and the room was already crammed with people. Coffee, tea, OJ, cranberry juice, fruit, muffins, pastries, bagels (with a toaster).

Do not expect frills or glamour, but it is clean, recently renovated, and close to a lot of attractions. About 8 blocks to Times Square, and several subway stations, each about 2 blocks away. The bed was super comfortable, linens soft and clean, plenty of pillows, and a clean bathroom. The furniture and fixtures are new and modern (no soiled linens, carpets, or chair coverings) in fact, everything was spotless. Of course, when you go to NYC it depends on what you're looking for in a hotel. The entrance was nothing more than a door and an awning, but there is a doorman who offers to call you a taxi, and (obviously) opens the door for you. Also, they are serious about security about checking your room key after hours. The lobby is small; what you see in the picture on their website really is all there is. (But how much time are you really spending in the lobby?) Someone commented on \"slow lifts,\" but I didn't notice any problems with them. If I had to complain about something (which I really have to look hard) is that the lighting in the room was odd. It very well could have been an office building transformed into a hotel. There was a flourescent light above the doorway and the rest of the room was lit by lamps. It seemed to take lighting all the lamps to get good light for the entire room, but this wasn't a problem, just worth commenting on. It is really a good bargain.

The hotel itself is clean, tidy and confortable. It is not the most luxurious hotel I have ever stayed in but, to be honest, if you're in NY you will not want to be in your hotel room for very long! Nevertheless, it is nicely decorated and perfectly adequate for a shopping or sightseeing trip. The bathroom is also spotless and room service good. The only slight complaint I would have is that the TV only had a couple of channels which were properly tuned in... but, as I said before, you will not have time for much watching TV in NY!!The view is fantastic of you manage to get one of the rooms facing the Empire State building (we actually requested this when booking online). The rooms on higher floors have the best view but these are the smaller rooms. The first time we went we were upgraded to a Junior Suite - this was HUGE and had a seating area, etc. The second time we had a superior room , which was very nice, just smaller, but as I said, the view was better.

This is only about 25 minute walk from the hotel. With regards to eating out, good restaurants are fairly sparse in the immediate area but you will probably want to explore a bit any way... my personal favourites are Little Italy, South Street Seaport and the Boathouse in Central Park. However, we did find a couple of lovely restaurants nearby: Blue Smoke (on 27th near Lexington, this does barbecue type food and has a jazz bar downstairs... great atmosphere) and Ilili (on 5th between 27th and 28th Street, this is the best Lebanese restaurant I have visited!) I would not think twice about where to stay in my next visit to NYC. The staff are great and will do all they can to make your visit a pleasant one. They are happy to hail cabs, book transfers to the airport... they even arranged for my boyfriend to send us a bottle of champagne when we were there for Valentine's Day!!", "Date": "June 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cShady area\u201d", "Author": "Carlii1964", "ReviewID": "UR17061397", "Content": "I read reviews and they were mixed, but I didn't think this place would be this bad.

I can honestly say that as we neared the hotel in our taxi, having come from Newark Airport via the Holland Tunnel (I think), the area did not give a good impression at all. The hotel is actually above some shady tat shops and a very grotty pizza restaurant, surrounded by intimidating \"hoodie\" or \"homeboy\" type gangs which is sad because this is an okay hotel. We were greeted courteously and shown to our rooms, which were reasonably clean and comfortable. There were a few suspect stains on the carpet and iron burns. The bed was comfortable and the linen was clean. The bathroom was rather dated with a 1970's pvc type cubicle within the bath instead of tiling. Again it was clean and the towels fresh. Another reviewer has mentioned the 1970's polystyrene type tiles on the ceiling and neon strip lighting, this is a bit of a naff element and simply changing this would probably brighten and modernise the room. The view was okay, better than some New York hotels as you can see the Empire State from the front (and probably the side) of the building. The room size is also above average I would say and all in all this hotel is...just okay really. I have no complaints about the staff, they were all reasonably pleasant. The breakfast facilities weren't great as the room is rather small and you have to wait ages for the elevator, balancing your breakfast while you wait. There is a microwave and coffee, tea and orange juice available 24 hours. The location is great, it's central and close to the subway station, if you cross the road straight ahead from the hotel and walk down 27th street you will get on to 5th ave, another member's advice was to cross here to walk up town rather than walking up Broadway as the unsavoury characters do congregate along this stretch of road. A Metro card is well worth your while (I can't remember how much it was but well worth the $ whatever it was). All in all I enjoyed my stay in the Broadway Plaza as the location is great, breakfast is included and the rooms okay but the actual locality is not the best and a real turn off for me.

We stayed at the Broadway Plaza for 3 nights having booked direct with the hotel. I can't compare it with anything else in New York as I've never stayed there before but I'll tell you what I think. The hotel is situated on the corner of Broadway and west 27th street so its actually only about a ten minute walk from Penn. station if you're coming in from Newark on the train as we did. The streets around the hotel are not the smartest as this hotel is in the garment district but we had absolutely no problems. If you're at all nervous then our tip would be to walk a block across to Fith Avenue instead of walking up Broadway, its nicer, This section of Broadway has a few groups of hooded locals hanging around during the day but its fine at night and as I said they were no problem at all but I can imagine some people would be a bit nervous. The hotel itself is fine, I paid about \u00c2\u00a3130 a night for a double with breakfast included. I think this is maybe a fair price for New York. Our room was on the 10th floor with a great view of E.S.B. The air con. system in our room made a loud whining noise a couple of times even though we weren't using it. Pretty poor really when you're tired and it starts at 4 a.m. I called down to reception and they told me it happens a lot and to turn the air con on and off so they obviously know there's a problem.. The room itself was clean and comfortable and the bathroom etc was fine so no problems at all other than the aircon and the staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast is machine coffee and orange juice and a selection of pastries and muffins which is ok for a quick start to the day but for anything more cross the street to the \"Naturally tasty\" diner which has more traditional eggs and stuff.. There's no restaurant and the breakfast room is about 4 little tables so don't expect lavish surroundings. There is a room service menu with reasonably priced food being delivered from a local cafe/ restaurant but we didn't use it so can't comment. We didn't use the T.V really so don't know about channels etc but there were pay per view channels etc. It was $9.95 a day for wireless broadband in your room if you have a laptop. About a block or 2 over there is internet access in cafe 28 if you need to check in on line etc for your return trip. The hotel is just round the corner from the Flat Iron building and 28th street subway is just round the corner.

Richard the Consierge sorted everything out and was very helpful.

The breakfast room has4 tables and is very poor. There is limited choice of pastries and bagels which are all really bland. Location wise the hotel is really central from most of the sites. We tend to walk loads so it made sense for us. Times Square 12 blocks away, Empire State a ten minute walk, we found it excellent. As regards the previous unsavoury area comment, I think it depends what you're used to.

We booked it as part of a joint airline/hotel package through Travelocity and did save several hundred dollars by doing so. Never again will we skimp. Next time we will pay the extra money to stay in the Time Square area. Technically, there's nothing egregiously wrong with the hotel, but it misleadingly advertises itself as a \"boutique\" hotel. This couldn't be further from the truth because there's nothing boutique about it. An \"economy\" hotel would be a better description. The building itself was okay; however, when we arrived the main elevator bank was being worked on (never a good sign), and we had to wait several minutes before we could even go to our room. (There are two elevator banks - one that goes only to the 7th floor and another that goes all the way to the 13th floor). The rooms are clean and appointed well enough, but there are no frills. No extra seating, and the lighting is not the best. No wi-fi or coffee maker. The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was very spacious by New York hotel standards. This is our 4th trip to New York together, and I used to live there, so I'm familiar with enough hotels to have a basis for comparison. The best asset of this hotel is its staff. They were hospitable, greeting us every time we entered the hotel and holding the door for us when we left. They left us extra towels when we asked for them and also provided satisfactory lunch and dinner recommendations. They would not, however, accommodate an late checkout request. The continental breakfast was serviceable but not the best. Orange juice, coffee, bagles, doughnuts, a few muffins, and a few turnovers. Hardly what I would call a bountiful selection, and the pastries were dry and not that good. The second morning we took advantage of the breakfast we got there around 8:40, 20 minutes before it ended. (The breakfast is only provided from 7:00 to 9:00). All the pastries were gone. The woman in charge of the breakfast area didn't take the initiative to restock even though there were several people waiting in line. (The room, by the way, is tiny and cramped and does not have adequate seating). When I asked her if there were any more turnovers, she didn't even speak to me but instead set about restocking. Her attitude was unpleasant, though, as if she were doing me a favor begrudgingly. I wasn't impressed. Another reviewer mentioned that this hotel probably used to be an office building, and I can definitely see this. Every floor is laid out differently, kind of chopped up in its floor design, and I wondered why there only seemed to be 6 or 7 rooms on each floor. The hallways had a funny smell (the rooms were okay, though), and the lighting was dim in the hallways as well. The decor wasn't warm or inviting. All of these items aside, the main problem is this hotel's location. This hotel is in an unsavory area, and I'm saying this as someone who's lived in different areas of New York. It is right on Broadway, but it's in a sort of \"no-man's land\" of midtown. By day, it is a little creepy because there are nothing but vendors and roving packs of young kids and thugs. It's an impoverished area, and there's nothing in the immediate area that would attract other tourists, so you are surrounded by masses of locals. If you walk one block north to 28th street, you can catch the NR subway line. If you walk two blocks west over to 7th Avenue and 28th Street, you can catch the red 1 subway line, which is okay by day, but very scary at night. At night, all of the streets around the hotel are desolate, especially the cross blocks. All the shop fronts are gated, and there is hardly anyone around and very few other businesses. It is creepy. On the final night of our stay, we were out late in the Village and took a cab back to the hotel around 1:15 in the morning. Approximately 6 blocks south of the hotel and one cross block over (on 6th Avenue), we encountered swarms of gang members blocking the intersection and preventing traffic from moving. There was an NYPD car in front of our cab that did nothing in spite of the fact that there was gang fighting and violence occurring on the right side of the street. It was a very tense, petrifying few moments as the gang members rushed across the street dodging in and out of traffic. I hurriedly rolled my window up, but was so thankful to finally get back to our hotel. However, I did not sleep well that night because I was so shook up and disconcerted by the fact that this all happened in such close proximity to where we were staying. In short, if you want to be in the heart of the theatre district and withing close walking distance to most of the midtown attractions, this is not the place to be. The hotel is spartan and is in an extremely dicey, unsafe area of town. I did not feel entirely comfortable there, and my partner and I will not stay there again. The few hundred dollars you save aren't worth it.

You could tell this was the case as there were only less than 5 rooms per floor. Once you were inside the hotel lobby, there wasn't a lobby. No where to sit, no restrooms, only a couple of people behind a desk serving the hotel guests checking in or out. The lights inside the room weren't lights that you would normally see inside a room. It was a huge fluorescent light that you would see inside an office to offer lighting over once's desk area. The light happened to be over the tv area. There wasn't anywhere in the room to lounge, just two beds and a small desk with one chair. The bathroom was huge only because it was a closet for supplies in the past. The tub enclosed shower had mold growing in thick layers in the corners of the shower. Although the water was hot, I can imagined how much mold/spores I inhaled during my shower. To order room service, you had to call a restaurant several blocks away, and they would deliver and add it to your hotel bill.

The room was well lit, nice TV and comfy bed. The shower was small, plastic and dark but we didn't spend a whole lotta time in it so who cared! I think I paid $189?

At all times when we passed through the front door of the hotel there was a door man who was very friendly and more than happy to offer helpful advice when we had a question. The location was fantastic, we walked up town to Times Square and beyond and also down to Greenwich Village and China Town and found it to be a very easy and enjoyable walk. There was a subway station nearby with very frequent services that took us anywhere else we wanted to go. The room was very large had 2 double beds and a large bathroom with a bathtub which was very nice after a long day of walking. And the view was amazing, the empire state building felt so close from our window that you could almost touch it! I'm sure not every room has a view like that so ask when you check in. So the airconditoning is a little bit noisey, we were one one of the higher floors so opened the window. The breakfast was a nice touch, we chose to take our breakfast back to the room and ate it enjoying the view, there was no need to sit in the small room with a lot of people walking around you. And having tea and coffee available at all times was really good as well. The thing I liked best about the hotel was how small it was, the staff were very friendly and some of the most helpful I have experienced for a long while. We lost our money in the vending machine and thought that we wouldn't get it back, no problem, just told the person at the front desk and he promptly refunded the money and gave me directions to the nearest convenience store. For those people that are interested in spending their money on designer beds and fancy toiletries, then this might not be the hotel for you, but if you have other things to spend your money on and just want a classic hotel with breakfast and friendly staff then this is probably a good choice. When I come back to New York I'll stay here again.", "Date": "October 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cVery good value\u201d", "Author": "kiwi_girl2", "ReviewID": "UR5905114", "Content": "Room was clean and tidy and had a great view of the empire state building and staff were very friendly.

It is not far from the Empire State Building, but you will have to ride the Subway to get anywhere else that you want to go.

The good: The Broadway Plaza has great rooms. They're clean, they're comfy, and if you're not a princess you'll be just fine. Think Holiday Inn pre-makeover. Nothing super special, but just fine. The place is small but there's nothing about the rooms to make you cringe. Certainly a better deal than Pennsylvania Hotel where my bathroom looked like something out of a horror film. The workers are generally friendly but there is some slight snappiness at the front desk when they're busy. The bad: The lobby is tiny. Not a big deal, unless you're checking in at the same time as other guests. The elevator can take forever sometimes, since there is only 1 that guests can use. The 'free breakfast' room is pretty overrated. It's more like a lounge in the back of a bank where employees drink a cheap, bad coffee mid-morning and toast bread in a toaster that grandma should have thrown out 5 years ago. The ugly: New York is not a pretty city. You will generally feel unsafe anywhere in the city, especially if you're not used to it. That said, this neighborhood is not touristy whatsoever and if you're not a New Yorker than you're going to feel out of place and possibly weary of your surroundings the first day or two. Do NOT go upstairs at the pizza place next door. There were no seats and we ventured up there only to find drug deals going down all around us. Keep in mind this is New York and it happens anyway - just maybe not as noticeably in other places. If you're going out at night, have the desk guy flag you a car. If you walk straight into the car then there are no issues. If you're in a group, not a huge deal. Nice and affordable hotels are hard to find in NYC and this one isn't horrible, but if you're a first timer and you're not \"street savvy\" do yourself a favor and spend a couple of extra bucks closer to Times Square where the lights are always bright and nothing lurks in the shadows.

For me the best thing about the room was it was SO quiet outside, literally the odd car going past but no beeping horns or other NY noises. \"Room service\" turns out to be a restaurant next door the hotel has hooked up with which during my stay was closed for renovations but I did get other menus brought to my room plus when the food arrived the security man called me first to let me know etc, I thought that was good.

There is an awful smell permeating the entire hotel that can only be described as somewhere between rotting food and cheap cleaning agent. I can't overemphasize how a bad smell can ruin an entire stay. 2.) The Elevators don't work. As mentioned prevously the 7th floor (where the vending machines were) was essentially unreachable by elevator - unless you have a crowbar to break down the elevator door. By the way the staircase smells disgusting - I found this out when I was trapped on the 7th floor. 3.) The neighborhood is VERY scary. I am a fairly seasoned traveller and even I was scared (not to mention my wife who was very fearful stepping out the hotel door). I am postive there were drugs being sold outside the hotel doors and purse snatchers on the prowl. Ask any cabbie and they will tell you this is NOT a tourist area. While the website points out how close the hotel is to major attracttions - you have to run a gauntlet of aggressive peddlers to get to them. 4.)

Big bonus is that the subway is one block away and is on the broadway line so you can get to most places you want to go quickly and easily. We felt quite safe using the subway and it was never crowded and intimidating like the london underground can be. If you want delis there are a few in 6th avenue a block away, plus a mcdonalds for milkshakes at 11pm if you want. There is an excellent jazz club and barbecue style restaurant on 27th and lexington 'jazz standard'. There are also good views of the empire state building from most rooms so you can check for visibility at the observation deck before you go. The breakfast was fine. bagels, doughnuts and pastries. Having tea/coffee and orange juice available all day was very good. There are vending machines as well if that isn't enough.

Always book direct with the hotel as the rates and rooms are better, if you book early you can oftern get a better price than even they advertise, we stayed for 5 nights and got a fuurther discount, e mail them and ask.", "Date": "March 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "swansea, wales u.k", "Title": "\u201cexcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "lewis_holmes", "ReviewID": "UR3306938", "Content": "we just came back from new york, we stayed at the broadway plaza from the 15/3/05 to 19/3/05 and had a fab time.

The Broadway Plaza is hiding between many non-retail shops and street vendors on Broadway street, with a tiny reception area occupied by very friendly and knowledgable stuff. The room was very small, but clean, and sufficient for our needs. An unexpected perk was a very pretty view of the Empire State Building from our window. The complimentary breakfast was very good - bagels, doughnuts and muffins, with cream cheese and very good jam, coffee tea and juice. Only minus is the breakfast room is very small, and you may find yourself waiting... or taking the food to your room.

We arrived in NYC on 7th Feb. got a cab to the hotel, first impressions outside were not great. The entrance is between two small shops we checked in but rooms were ready. The receptionist was ok but not overly helpful, went a walk around the area a lot of quite aggresive street vendors outside the hotel and for the next couple of blocks heading uptown. The room when we got it was very clean and seemed ok, later however a loud noise of an industrial machine droned in our room. I rang down to reception, Richard the consierege came up to check out the noise he was very helpful and appologetic. The noise came from next door he reported and nothing could be done---. We asked if they could swap the room, no they were all booked up. After a long trip we needed some rest this was not a good start to our trip at all. To cut a long story short I used the phone and yellow pages in the room to ring other hotels, got the same rate at Holiday Inn Martinique on Broadway. Checked out later that same night- no refund at Plaza not even the offer of a %. I emailed them on my return not any response from them at all. The Holiday Inn was SUPERB all areas of service quality, surroundings, food, location, customer service etc. They saved the day, the Broadfway Plaza is ok for a basic business stop over without the frills but for a family trip think again. The neighbourhood here can feel intimidating for Manhattan which we find generally safe and at ease in. Richard I felt sorry for he did his best, pity the other staff there did not live up to him. NYC is a great place to visit and we will be back again soon (at The Holiday Inn that is).

There's also a subway one block away. If, like me, you're a newcomer to NYC, I'd recommend reading up on the subway system first and using a small station like this one to start with - I wouldn't want anyone to have a repeat of our comedy of errors experience at the bigger station on 34th Street! The staff at the hotel were great - very friendly and helpful. We'd put in a request for a smoking room, but none were available, so they let us have an ashtray in our room. We asked for a view of the Empire State, which we got. The room wasn't big, but more than adequate, and the bed was very comfy. There's also maid service every day.

My traveling companion, my sister, likes a bathtub, & the front desk was more than willing to offer a switch. We decided not to bother, but front desk personnel were very accommodating, especially day clerk, Trinity. One day I asked for directions to a place the front-desk staff were not familiar with. They pulled out maps & books & tried their best to help, which they finally were able to do. They really go above & beyond to give good service.

For three blocks there are loads of market tradesmen with cheap bags, belts and scarves and such. Its a busy area, that is a littered with the days rubbish at the end but this is quickly taken away by the refuse. This should not put you off as the hotel is in the best postion ever! If you turn left up Broadway you come to Macy's and 34th Street within 6-7 blocks, then Times Square is only five mintues away from there.

My bathroom was smallish with some wear-in-use but it was clean. WiFi was slow and skittish but useable---the Website quoted a $9.95 daily charge but I didn't see one on my bill. Hardly any street noise, and my low-floor room fronted right on Broadway! this was amazing. I worked through Continental breakfast the next morning but the 24/7 coffee service was a very welcome amenity.
