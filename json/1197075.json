In my opinion, it is the best hotel in Vegas if you plan to have a car during your stay. Reasons: 1- It's not one of those gigantic cassino hotels where you have to walk for 20 minutes to get to your room. 2- Parking is free and there's always space - so you don't have to wait for the valet to park and bring your car (and tip him) but you also won't have to drive around for hours looking for a space. 3- Breakfast is included and it is very good. I saw several reviews complaining that they always ran out of items at the buffet, but I stayed there for 10 days, had breakfast on most of them and didn't have this issue. 4- There are no resort fees and wireless internet is avaliable for free. 5- The rooms are very big and even have a full kitchen in case you want to cook. 6- Location is great, you're less than 5 min drive away from the Strip, and because it's not on the strip, you can use alternative ways to avoid traffic. 7- It's not the cheapest hotel in Vegas, but I thought it had a good cost/benefit ratio. The only negative point of this hotel is about their cleanning schedule. They have a police to only fully clean your room once a week - during weekdays they will only replace towels, take off trash and do the beds, and they won't do anything on weekends. That was ok with me, but I think it should have been better planned... I stayed there for 10 days, and they only fully cleaned the room on day 8, when we were about to leave... Not very cleaver in my opinion. I definitly would stay there again. I would only not recommend this hotel if you plan to stay in Vegas without a car. In this case, even though the hotel has a complimentary shuttle (I didn't use it, so I don't know if it's good), I think the best option would be to stay in one of the cassinos on the Strip.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Front Royal, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Off the Strip Hotel\u201d", "Author": "cwousar", "ReviewID": "UR122997448", "Content": "This Staybridge Hotel is a hidden gem in Las Vegas.

We were told that the only accomodations for 4 were a king bed and sleeper sofa, but that the room would be made up for the four of us. In addition to our written reservation, we also placed 3 phone calls to make sure the room was set correctly. We arrived at 7:00 pm and checked in. The sofa bed was not made up. We called the front desk and were told no one else was working at the hotel except the shuttle driver who was out driving, but on his return, he would come up and make the bed. After waiting 45 minutes to an hour, with still no return of the shuttle driver, we asked for sheets to make it up ourselves. We were told no. No managment on duty until the next day. Hotel room was not very clean. The breakfast buffet was missing several items, supposedly because of machines out of order. Dirty plates and silverware mixed in with the clean. We tried to talk with a manager the next morning and were avoided. After several emails back and forth with no apologies, only blame toward us, they finally took $50 off and removed a pet fee. With a bill for $300, this seems inadequate to say the least. We had been traveling all day and just wanted to go to bed. Instead it took several hours to get sheets thrown over (not even tucked in) a sleeper sofa for our daughters. Our reservation paperwork clearly showed 4 people. The manager's excuse was that they are a \"suites\" hotel with king beds and not set up for families. With no managment or staff other than a desk clerk and shuttle driver on duty in Las Vegas at 7:00pm, they are ill prepared for any guests arrival. With the poor housekeeping in the room and breakfast room, it is very questionable what level of service they will provide at all. Very disappointing after reading other reviews on Trip Advisor. The manager's fall back was to send copies of phone logs which did not accurately portray what my phone calls had even been about and he completely ignored what my reservation paperwork showd.

The food the hotel offered at both the breakfast AND the sundowner meal was excellent. Especially the grilled burgers and hot dogs.

I checked the hotel's reviews on TripAdvisor and booked the (very good) rate. I wasn't disappointed. Staybridge is as other reviewers have described: clean, comfortable, and (mostly) pretty quiet. I arrived at noon, and the front-desk clerk apologized that my \"one-bedroom suite\" wouldn't be ready until around 3 p.m.: not surprising, given the hotel's popularity and a weekend stay. What was surprising was the offer of the suite, as I'd only booked the standard king-bed studio. (The clerk said that Staybridge normally upgrades government reservations to the suites when available.) I asked if one of those was ready; it was, and I was on my way. The studio was fine. I was at the end of the hall and thus right next to a stairway, which proved to be much more convenient for parking and quick access to the lobby. (The elevators were located pretty far down the hall.) The room itself, while narrow, was well laid out, with all the good conveniences and features that others have noted: big bathroom, full kitchen, comfortable sitting area, up-to-date LCD TV, and balcony. I even had a good view (over Russell Rd.) of the southern end of the Strip. Staybridge's location is a plus: just west of the Strip, off Russell Rd., in its own quiet little zoned subdivision (as with so much in Vegas). Getting to and back from the Strip was thus a breeze, and there's convenient parking ringing the hotel. I had a rather noisy family staying next to me, but the sound wasn't too bad. Staybridge seems to be a bit bitter than average on this score for its three-star category; indeed, the overall quality and the amenities of this well-maintained four-year old property would appear to justify a four-star classification.

No wheels, no problem. They have a shuttle that transports guests to and from the strip. The hotel has spacious suites that are well equiped and outclass the competition in their class, such as Embassy Suites.The fitness room is bigger than most I've stayed in. But..... Two types of amenities thast are tie breakers for me, are hot-tubs/whirlpools, and a \"full breakfast\". The full breakfast is poor in comparison to the afore-mentioned competition. The staff in this area appears to be limited in numbers. If one member doesn't turn up, then as happened, the full breakfast became continental. The remaining young Lady to her credit, worked like a trojan to try and compensate, but there was still no hot food. On other shifts, people like Adolpho, were very personable and reliable and a full breakfast ensued.. The hot-tubs, of which there were two adjacent to the heated outdoor pool, were cold tubs. The front desk staff weren't aware that they were out of service, and that parts were awaiting. Doesn't say much for the communication between maintenance and front desk. And... Timing is everything with the shuttle service. If you book a return shuttle time that coincides with the time of the front desk shift change, and the fact that you are waiting for the said vehicle as you bake in the afternoon sun outside the MGM, but the handover/takeover doesn't bear mention of your request to be picked up, then as they say, you will be hung out to dry, literally. I can attest to this, and apparently, it's not an uncommon event. If the troughs could be expunged, then this place is great value. However, there is a certain amount of denial by management, and thus I expect similar negative events to transpire. You either want return business, and optimize occupancy levels, or you inadvertantly and unwittingly, become unpaid representatives of your competition. I'd like to return, but a culture change must ensue. If you bring any of these issues to the staff's attention, then those big beaming smiles that greet you on arrival, are replaced by testiness. I know, some of us are just too picky and should be more forgiving, and I'm sure others had better experiences, but last week, I doubt it.

From the moment we walked into the Staybridge Suites I knew we would love it. I had reviewed several hotels before our trip and the Staybridge was one of the frontrunners. On our fourth day we drove here and were very lucky they still had rooms. The previous night they were fully booked. Once we arrived I was greeted by a friendly front desk clerk. I don't remember her name but she immediately made us feel welcome. After our previous hotel, I was hesitant about booking a room without seeing it. The staff were very nice and within 20 minutes showed us two newly cleaned suites. Both were gorgeous rooms. We paid a little extra since they only had two rooms left and chose one of the largest suites. It was amazing. Our room faced the awesome pool. The room itself was large and spacious. Main features were a full size kitchen, washer/dryer, dining-room table for four, large living-room sectional which made into a bed, large LCD TV, separate King bedroom with another LCD TV, en-suite with double sinks, nice sized tub, separate bathroom with toilet, shower and sink. There also was a small balcony with 2 chairs and a small table. I only wish the door came with some instructions on how to lock/unlock it. Figuring that out was a challenge. The room was clean and stocked with a couple items like coffee and a small bag of popcorn. We cooked a few nights in the room which was great but the range fan is not vented outside. It just blows into the room. ? The king bed was very comfortable with higher quality bed linens and great pillows. Finally I was able to get a good nights sleep. This was a welcome surprise and much needed. The pool is salt water which surprised us. My kids were not so sure about it. One hated it but soon became used to it, loved it and never wanted to leave. All this despite the incredible heat. It is fairly deep for little children but is really great for emerging swimmers. The shallow end is about 3 1/2 feet and dips to around 5 feet. There is a ledge around the whole pool which was great. The pool is large and was never crowded. There is a section that is shallow and is nicely designed with a waterfall feature. Just behind the waterfall are showers and bathrooms. One thing to note is the Staybridge keeps their pool area clean and the pool water is checked every morning. I saw someone out each morning performing pool maintenance. There is also an abundance of pool loungers with towels on each one, and patio tables with umbrellas to enjoy. One thing I should mention is when outside it is fairly noisy from airline traffic. It is so loud at times you cannot hear the music playing around the pool or one another for that matter. This was an okay trade off for us since we loved the hotel, the pool and the staff. A great thing about the Staybridge is the free breakfast in the morning. They also have a few nights a week where they serve light supper but we missed those. At any rate, the breakfast is hot and served fresh in the morning. The dining room is nicely decorated and is kept clean. At the buffet you could find eggs, omelettes, biscuits, sausages, bacon, fruit salad, fresh whole fruit, hot oatmeal, coffee, tea, juices, milk, yogourt, waffles, bagels, bread and muffins. The staff was very nice, the patrons were equally as nice and you couldn't ask for a better way to start the day. This hotel is in a great location too. It's located southwest of the Mandalay Bay. It's close to the highway with easy accessibility to many places and is only minutes away from the airport. The Las Vegas Town Center, and both the North and South outlets are only minutes away. Not far down the highway west is a larger outdoor mall area with a Walmart and other stores. I believe it is called Arroyo Center. Housekeeping consists of emptying trash, refreshing towels and making beds. If you're staying for 7 nights or more, they'll do a more thorough cleaning. One thing to note is on weekends there is no housekeeping unless requested. We stayed over a weekend and I have never experienced this type of service or lack of service before. I can make my own bed and rehang my own towels but I really could have used some cleaning supplies for the sinks. For the price you pay for this hotel a light cleaning included with the housekeeping would have been nice. Other than housekeeping concerns, we really enjoyed our 4 night stay at this hotel.

Free buffet style breakfast in the morning, you pay for dinner. Free shuttle that takes you to the strip, drop-off and pick-up at the MGM Grand and it runs every hour and the last shuttle is at 10pm or 11pm but you can catch a cab back or take the bus which drops you off 1 blck from the hotel at Mandalay Bay hotel.

Flat screen television in the bedroom and living room area, huge bathroom with double sinks, full complete kitchen and the bonus was a washer and dryer that you could use for free but you had to pay for your own detergent which was fine for me.

The pool area is great and the hotel gets extra points for the cabanas. When I went to the pool, it was only 5 of us out there and it was wonderful and very very peaceful. If you do not like noise and want to stay away from the strip, this is the hotel to stay at.

There is no free shuttle to the hotel from the airport, but the hotel shuttle is free from the hotel TO the airport. The fare from the airport was around $18, before the tip.

Most of the larger suites have their own washer and dryer, but the studios don't. The Staybridge has washers and dryers that guests can use for free. That was a first for me.

There were two flat screen tvs in our suite. The kitchen was very well appointed, including a dishwasher. We even had a little balcony, not that there was anything to see except a few police actions.

The room itself was spacious, elegantly furnished and had a compact but perfectly equipped kitchen. The bed was comfortable, and I had no problems with my feet sticking over the edge (I'm 6'10'' and that happens a lot). The bathroom was as close to perfect as it gets, with a great shower that had excellent water pressure. Lots of towels of every different size too.

I could only hear the cars (And the planes taking off) with the door open, didn't have any problems hearing them when I fell asleep. Wireless Internet was good, no problems with signal strength or speed (I managed to Skype call without any issues). The car park was secure, with a regular security patrol on the grounds. There was also a little fitness centre, that had a good selection of cardio machines. On my first night I went to see the Blue Man Group at the Venetian (See separate review on that one). On the way back, I stopped at a Target and bought some supplies (As I was going to be driving up to Northern California a few days later). Consequently I came back with a few 12 packs of Mountain Dew, some water and other bags. I was able to make it to the lobby with these, but not much further. A hotel employee named Eduardo offered to help, and assisted me with carrying some of the items up to my room. He was extremely helpful, and even refused when I offered to tip him.

We had visited for a couple of nights last June and decided to return this year, to really spend more time in LV to enjoy the weather and local entertainment. The suites are spacious and very well presented. The kitchens have everything you need, and as long as you are not in one of the small studios (dont waste your time in them) you will also have in-suite laundry facilities. We chose the king-bed suite again, and had more than enough space. All very clean. Excellent value. The swimming pool is a very nice size, and is never busy. At its busiest during our stay we shared the pool area with 5 other people. About 495 less than if we had been staying at the Bellagio. The hottubs are a nice i treat for after sunset. The hotel has ample parking right outside, and the shuttle bus will take you to the strip at the top of the hour. Driving to the strip is also very easy, and self-parking at any of the bigger hotel/casinos was always very easy. Taxi rides back to the hotel should not set you back more than about $15. Breakfast does the trick, with plenty on offer, and on Tue/Wed/Thur you can also pickup a complimentary evening meal down in the breakfast room/lounge. We were treated to some nice BBQ treats one evening. Perfect pre-gambling snack! Perhaps the best thing going for the Staybridge LV is the wonderful service provided by the very willing staff. From reception through house-keeping, we were always greeted by smiles and a friendly hello. Everybody seemed to take pride in their job, and helps keep it running very smoothly. I was very happy to find the ever helpful Eduardo still working there. I am very pleased to say that this hotel is still as great as we remembered from 2009. Yes, a pool view room does also result in quite a bit of noise from planes when they take off towards the west from McCarran, and yes I am sure the air conditioning in the rooms could be a little quieter (tip: cool the room well before bedtime and then turn it off for the night), but regardless, I would always look to stay here if I was wanting to be just a short ride away from the strip. If the glamour (and chaos) of staying on the strip does not appeal to you, then I suggest you check out the Staybridge Suites on Dean Martin Drive.

As mentioned before, all the staff were extremely helpful and nice. The rooms are suite style and very spacious, clean and contemporary. The full fridge and washer/dryer came in handy. The free breakfast was also wonderful, with both hot and cold choices. Not having to pay for breakfast every morning can be a big money saver. The hotel also has a shuttle that runs to the MGM every hour until 10pm. We used it almost every day. The hotel is basically across I-15 from Mandalay, and while not on the strip, it is definitely walkable if you don't mind walking a couple miles. We walked home from the strip every night with no problems. The pool area is also very nice, and doesn't have the party scene of most of the large hotel/casino pools. With 2 hot tubs, and large swimming pool, and cabanas, it was easy to relax and enjoy the quiet pool atmosphere. Perfect for escaping the craziness of the strip. The excercise room was also very large and well equipped with dumbells, weight machines, treadmills, stair steppers and a strip view. There really isn't anything to dislike about this hotel. I'd recommend a pool view room if you plan to spend time on the balcony though, as the balconies on the strip view rooms are noisy due to adjacent I-15 (the noise was not an issue inside the room however), and the view is of the backside of the strip so not that impressive.

We stayed at this hotel for 4 months in 2009 and we are back for at least 2 months in 2010. Since 2009, the hotel had a 95% staff turnover. All the people we liked from last year are gone. The big difference this year is that the hotel has become less guest friendly. The price of the room includes daily breakfast and a light dinner on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. In terms of dinner they seem to run out of things, even if you arrive at a reasonable time. Last night was Pasta Night and they were out of tomato sauce about 1/2 hour after dinner started. How expensive is plain tomato sauce? Last year the hotel provided non-stop soft drinks and coffee. This year, they only offer coffee during breakfast and soft drinks from 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM. And usually they are out of ice. What I find particularly annoying is that housekeeping pays NO attention to the DO NOT DISTURB sign! (Don't even bother to put it up)!!! With the Do Not Disturb sign on the door, they start banging on the door early on a Sunday Morning.and try to get in if you don't open the door in 3 seconds! You say no to them, and they again come back a short while later and ignore the do not disturb sign. Not a very pleasant situation after a late Saturday Night in Las Vegas. These may not be earth shattering problems but the culture of the hotel is changing but not for the better. My other complaint is that this hotel has the slowest Internet that I have ever experienced. It is virtually impossible to watch anything on Youtube or any other online video. If you want to do more than just browse and check your emails, then you will not be happy with this Internet. It is very slow, especially during peak hours. Mind you, the hotel doesn't charge extra for it. Still, as everybody mentions, the rooms are very nice. The location is pretty good, near I15 and just south of Mandalay Bay.

Our daughter and her husband flew in to join us. Based on the reviews here on Tripadvisor, we decided to both book a suite at the Staybridge. All I can say is the reviews are correct. The hotel is extremely nice, not far off the strip, and the suite we had was beautiful. Nicely decorated, it was huge. There was a full kitchen (with stainless appliances), a dining area , large corner sofa that also turned into a sleeper, a separate bedroom, Flat screen TVs in both the living and bed rooms, a tub, dual sinks, and a separate room with a walk-in shower, sink and toilet. This suite was larger than several apartments we have lived in. All this for less than a standard room at most of the casino hotels. Everything was clean and in excellent shape, and even though they said that they only cleaned the rooms on the weekend by request, they straightened up our room and provided clean towels even though we did not request it. The hotel is only 2 blocks away from the Mandalay Bay, was convenient to roads that allowed for easy access to the big casinos. Although they have a shuttle, you will definitely appreciate having a car at this hotel. With its location, it was easy to access the casinos on the East side of the strip and avoid having to drive on the strip. Granted, there is no room service or in-hotel restaurant, however, we wanted to eat at several of the well known chef's restaurants. The no-smoking building, and free breakfast along with the well-appointed large suites, made this a reasonable compromise for the price. Ok, I had a couple of quibbles. When we arrived at about 2:30 in the afternoon, the desk clerk told us he could not check us in before 3:00 PM. We said our daughter had called and said she was already there. We asked him to check and he said that no one was there by that name. So, we called her cell phone and she had indeed already checked in and was in a suite on the 3rd floor. We decided that the 4 of us would just go get a late lunch. And when we returned about 5:30 PM, the manager apologized profusely for the confusion earlier and said the clerk was new. In my book though, it was no-harm, no-foul. One other small quibble is that I thought the shower head was rather oddly placed in the walk-in shower.

While there was a shuttle running between the hotel and the strip, this only ran every hour, and the final bus came back from Vegas at around 10pm. This didn't make a lot of sense to us considering that Vegas is a city that most people would want to be exploring at night. Getting back to the hotel late at night was difficult because taxi drivers did not seem to have heard of this hotel. We also found that we had very little hot water in our room, which was quite frustrating when wanting to unwind with a nice shower or bath after a long day.

A closet with stackable washer/dryer, nice dining table for 4, larger sofa with one side you can lay down on? can't remember what they are called. Balcony with table and two chairs. Nice large picture window in living room area, coffee table, larger flat screen t.v. in wall unit. Bedroom had king bed, with tons of pillows. There was a little placard saying there were feather down pillows in a closet if that was your preference. The bedroom had a door to the balcony as well. Two nightstands, and dresser with another flat screen t.v. A clothes closet in the bedroom. Ironing board and iron. Bathroom: nice larger tub/shower with granite type tile on floor. Beautiful vanity area with 2 sinks and mirrors. Nice lighting, not flourescent. Large bathroom, that could be accessed from main living area and bedroom. We have never been in a room that was so freshly painted and modernly decorated in every room. Service: front desk employees were excellent,; patient, cheerful, and helpful.Helped us with directions, etc. We saw a sign at desk mentioning a free shuttle to the MGM Grand regularly and back to Staybridge. Pool area: Never crowded. Nice pool and two jacuzzi's surrounded by some palm trees. Many chaise lounges, some with thick cushions, and 2 or 3 cabana types with the mattress and roof. BBQ grills, and outdoor tables for drinks and breakfast. FREE BREAKFAST!! This had bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, omelets(egg type changed on the two days we were there)yogurt, breads, several types of fruit, juice, coffee, milk. Anything we couldn't eat(ate in our room) we just put in fridge for a snack later. There was a convenience type store right in the hotel. We bought a couple of micromeals.

We are SO glad we did not spend more than twice as much to stay on the Strip! Since it is close to the airport there were planes taking off quite often, but from what we heard from others attending the wedding, it was much quieter than their hotels with music playing loudly all the time.

We usually stay on the strip on our Vegas trips but after realizing how expensive that would be on a holiday weekend, I looked into alternatives and noticed all the great reviews of this place here on Tripadvisor. I was a little apprehensive on how a hotel like this could be ranked #1 of ALL the hotels in Vegas, but after staying there I can definitely understand the rave reviews it gets. The hotel is located right on the other side of the I-15 highway from Mandalay Bay and THEhotel, and I would highly recommend it to anyone traveling to Vegas and has a car. It is not walking distance to the strip at all and while there is a shuttle that runs to the MGM, it only runs every hour and stops at 11pm, so we just drove to each place we wanted to go and took advantage of the free valet parking everywhere. When we checked in on Saturday, the front desk were telling a number of people ahead of us that they had overbooked rooms and would have to move them across the parking lot to the Fairfield Inn and Suites, but that they would get a refund back for their night stay. While it would've been nice to not pay for a night's stay, I didn't want to stay somewhere else, and luckily since I was a Priority Club member, a room was still available to us. We were assigned room 514 with a view of the pool. The room looked completely new, with a full kitchen, living room, large bathroom, separate bedroom with king bed, and even a washer/dryer in one machine. As others have mentioned, free breakfast is included in your stay and is served 7:30-10:30am on weekends, and 6:30-9:30am on weekdays. They had plenty of food, cereals, oatmeal, bagels/breads, yogurts, fruit, premade cheese omelets, sausage patties, biscuits, gravy, and a waffle maker that was quite popular. I also hung out at the pool one morning and there were only a handful of people around. They had comfy lounge chairs, as well as 3 cabanas for anyone to use. If you are looking for somewhere to stay with poolside service and $20 slushies, then this isn't the place for you, but if you want peace and quiet in the sun or shade, whatever your preference, this is the perfect spot. All in all, if I could get a good deal on the strip, I would probably prefer to stay there for the convenience. However, if the Staybridge is cheaper than what the strip has to offer, then I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. You will not be able to find the conveniences of having your own kitchen, laundry facilities, free internet, and free breakfast anywhere else for this price.", "Date": "September 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cGreat overall experience\u201d", "Author": "bjustice", "ReviewID": "UR39954425", "Content": "The hotel is only about a mile from the Las Vegas strip.

The hotel is located just past \"The Strip\", which makes it far enough from the congestion, noise, smoke, poker machines and posters/videos of scantily-clad women to please any parent, but convenient enough to get there to see some of the sites (like the pirate show and volcano, big hits with the preschool set). The hotel offers a shuttle to the middle of the Strip, although we rented a car and parked at the casinos, which was free. The hotel is brand-spanking new, and the rooms are gigantic. We booked a king-suite, which included a separate bedroom for us with a door, pull-out sofa for our 5-year-old in the living room, small dining room & full kitchen complete with oven, dishwasher, and full washer/dryer. Big, new bathroom with double sinks. Balcony overlooking the pool (definitely request pool view, as the other side of the hotel looks at a highway). Maid service was spotless. Bed was super comfy, and the sofa-bed not bad either. Two flat-screen TVs, one in each room. The pool is large, with a great shallow end for little kids (about 1 \u00bd feet deep) with fountains cascading from a wall. They have two hot tubs, cabanas (free!) and nice squishy loungers. Couldn't get my daughter out of the pool, and there were few people in it the entire week, either because it's a little off-season or because most of the adults were off at the casinos. We felt like we owned the place. There's an outdoor gas grill for guests to use \u2013 go buy a steak and grill it up (cheaper and tastier than at the casinos). Breakfast includes hot dishes \u2013 rotation of omelets or scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, and all of the usual continental fare like bagels, danish, oatmeal. Oh, and make-your-own waffles. On Tues-Thurs they also serve a 530 PM appetizer buffet, with hotdogs/burgers fresh from the grill, tacos, salad bar, etc. But what made breakfast/appetizer service really special was Sandra, the woman who runs the dining room. She was so welcoming and hospitable \u2013 she went in the back to get my daughter fruit during one of the evening meals, and if we showed up a little early or late for breakfast, she made sure we had something to eat. (A lot of hungover patrons made similar comments after dragging downstairs too late for breakfast...) It's rare to find such attentive and warm service these days, and she set a great standard. Oh, they had free internet in the business center, and a really nice fitness center overlooking the mountains. Vegas is exciting and there's a lot to do at the Strip (don't miss Zion and Bryce!), but if you're with kids, it's REALLY nice to have a haven from all the glitter and just relax at a place that's really welcoming to families.

We booked a one bedroom king size suite for one night (August 28-29 2009), since we needed to stay in Vegas for one night for a family trip, and we wanted a clean place that did not take forever to get around like the huge strip hotels yet was close to everything and had all the amenities. I am so glad we chose Staybridge Suites! We usually travel to 4-5 star resorts so I was skeptical whether I would indeed find similar quality, yet we did! We arrived 11:30 am, way too early, yet staff was wonderful and checked us in immediately - we had suite 500, very private, last suite at the end of the hallway, with a pool view. The whole hotel is very clean, new and modern, and there is no trace of that musty smell that comes with most old(er) mega hotels on the strip. It is a non-smoking property as well, and everything was fresh and clean. The one bedroom was just like a timeshare apartment - full kitchen with Whirlpool stainless steel appliances, two flat screen large TVs (one in bedroom and one in living room), AC, two (smaller) closets with hangers, dining table with chairs, small balcony with two chairs and one table, alarm clock, washer and drier in unit, bathroom with double sinks. Free breakfast is nice, yet for a healthy eater I could not find many healthy choices - they had pastries, eggs with cheese inside (that was the part that I did not like, the cheese made the meal heavy), the fresh fruit was sunk in sweet syrup, bagels, waffles. Very good meal if you are not terribly health conscious. The business center has free internet and printing, so you can print boarding passes, which we did since we did not carry our laptop with us, but wireless is also free if you need it. Parking is free, there are no resort fees, no additional charges other than the nightly room rate plus tax. The pool was lovely, there were towels available on the back of the chairs, there is shade and actual cabanas with mattresses to lay on, which usually you only find at 4-5 star resorts only. We did not use the free shuttle but I understand there is a free shuttle to the strip every hour until 11 pm. Overall, we loved this place - if you want to be close to the strip yet away from its craziness, if you want a clean, new, modern place with no musty smell, if you want no resort fees and wireless fees and all sorts of extra charges, and free breakfast, this is the place for you.

We had the Pool and two Jacuzzi's to ourselves during the day - although temperatures were hitting an all time high at 107degrees & we spent most of it under the umbrellas and cushioned loungers. There were 4 poster bed style loungers too if you wanted them. We had a nosey in the pool area of the Luxor and this was heaving with people all crammed into the pool area - the Staybridge was a breath of fresh air. The rooms were fab and brand new, the beds were huge and were very high. I'm only 5ft 2 and I needed to jump a bit to get on them!! The kitchen was fully equiped with everything you needed with free coffee and popcorn and also had a washer and a dryer. Location wise, the hotel is not on the strip. In fact it is on the other side of the I15, this meant we had to drive 5 mins to the strip but we parked for free at the Luxor. So it wasn't that much of a problem. We did have an issue with a trip we had organised and the organisers would not pick us up from our location, we had to drive to them - I think this is more an issue with the organisers of the trip - Pallion Helicopters. Breakfast was good with fresh fruit and hot options but dinner was poor (soup & a poor limp salad(limp due to the weather I think)) - both were free which was a added bonus for a self catering facility.

Shuttle bus is excellent ( leaves 'top of hour' to strip and 'bottom of hour' to airport but only on request, so if you are on strip and want bus home you need to ring reception, as if no-one is going to strip you won't get picked up. Shuttle bus drivers are so helpful, indeed called at Petrol sation/Food store opposite for us to pick up beer/water and used his ID for us as we didn't have ours ( in Vegas need ID all the time irrespective of age! We didn't need a car. 2. Pool is large, clean and have a good suppy of clean towels, and enough sun beds for all. 3. We found location superb. Whilst strip is great fun we didn't want to be on it 24/7. For a quiet night there is free Pizza delivery to hotel, and of course you can stock Your own fridge/freezer up with drinks! 4. Our daughter particularly enjoyed the free Wi Fi throughout hotel. 5. Fitness Suite was superb. Its large, several machines and well air conditioned. 6.

We stayed two nights and it was easily the best value hotel I've ever stayed in. The hotel is only opened since Sept '08 so everything is sparklig new. The suites are like a self contained apartment with a fully equipped kitchen stocking the best quality delph and cutlery. There is even a dishwasher and free laundry facilities downstairs. The bed and bed lien were superb (way too much bed clothes for the 110 degrees of heat). We had our own balcony too. Midweek the hotel provides an evening reception with salads, tacos, sausages etc available.. Breakfast had omelettes, sausage, eggs bacon etc as well as fruit and yogurts. Incredible service. Perhaps the rates are not so good at weekends but they can't be that much dearer. The hotel did provide a free shuttle service to and from the strip as well. It is about a two mile trip and the shuttle runs until 10.30pm. A taxi for coming home later will cost about \u20ac10. We missed the shuttle one morning (runs every hour) and decided to walk as it didn't look to be too long of a walk. MISTAKE!........ We meandered around the Manderlay hotel to get to the strip in incredible \"hot hairdryer\" type heat at 10.00am............it took ages and not to be recommended. Vegas is not made to suit pedestrians, no footpaths etc. This hotel is just great and the fact that it's not on the strip I consider to be a bonus.

The 1 BR suite was really nice, flat screen tv, seperate tub and shower, double sink in tub area and another sink in the shower/lavatory area. Sectional sofa and flat screen tv in the sitting area along with a dinner table for 4. Bed was extremely comfortable with flat screen on the wall in the BR. We chose the \"strip view \" as oppose to the pool view. We had a rental so we did not encounter the shuttle bus problems mentioned in the other reviews. Problems -- Being that we stayed for a week, the first 3 days the maid service was wonderful. However, around mid-stay it was horrible. One day we did not receive services at all and had to wait an hour or so for towels. The next day, the bed was made, but the tub had not been cleaned, only a few towels were left (no hand or face towels). One day I thought I saw the maid take a hand towel from one rack, turn it inside out, and place it on the other rack (wasn't for sure so I didn't say anything). At the end of the stay, I was totally disgusted with the maid service. I had planned to leave a tip at the end of the stay; however, the only tip she received was to do a BETTER JOB! Also, our room was above the workout facilities and I had to call the front desk several times to complain about guests dropping weights...very annoying! Just don't stay on the 3rd floor above the workout facility (which is on the 2nd floor). By the way, they did offer to move us, but who wants to pack up all their stuff and move????

Our experience here at Staybridge was very positive. Check in was quick, and the desk clerk and security guard were very friendly and helpful.

We decided to take the night off, relax in the suite, have a cocktail on the small veranda and move on in the morning. The bed was very comfortable so we slept in on Saturday and nearly missed breakfast. The one problem was that there were no eggs by that time (9:20 am). Everything else was adequate, but not spectacular; we brought our meal back and ate in the room since the breakfast area was quite full and everything we needed was in our own kitchen. Before leaving, we decided to check out the pool. There were only a few people there, so rather than fight the crowd at MB, we checked out of the room but asked to stay and use the pool, which was fine with them. We spent the day relaxing in the sun (and shade) on the padded lounges and retiring to the (free) cabana for a quick nap. There were no added amenities with the cabana (TV, shower, personalized service) like other pools, but it was just right for our day.

Check-in was a breeze and very friendly front desk staff. We were given 3 keys and quickly headed up to our pool facing suite. All amenities appeared to be in working order and clean. As bedtime approached (we were there on a semi-business trip) we discovered that the pull out sofa had no linens. Why I ask were we not informed of this at check in? Service?? So a phone call was made to the front desk around 10ish and he said it would be up right away with the linens. 30 minutes pass and no linens, junior is getting tired and would like to rest on his sofa sleeper. Now I go down to the front desk and demand the linens and refuse to leave until they appear. He had forgotten to call housekeeping and they were on their way, yadayadayada. So I wait at the front desk another 10 minutes or so for them to finally arrive. We put junior down and all is good or so it seems. Now it is past 11 and granted it was a Friday night, but the rock music (great tunes) wa sblaring by the pool and numeorus guests were enjoying a late night dip. My experience with hotels in Vegas is around dusk they close, not here. So at 11:15 another call to the front desk asking them to turn off the LOUD music and ask the guests to leave the pool area. 30 minutes pass and still we hear Smoke on the Water at a party level. Finally the misses has had enough and she marches doewn to the front desk. They were engaged in conversation (front desk and security guard) and had forgotten about my earlier phone call. Said something like; \"I didn't realize that the music was still on.\" So to make a long story short; rooms are nice (ask for linens at check in), exercise room well equipped, breakfast is fine (no bacon!), location is convenient to south strip,but service is lacking if non existent.

The hotel is about a quarter mile from Las Vegas Blvd (the \"Strip\") just East of I-15 at the Russell Ave interchange. While the walk is feasible, it is a little long on a hot day.

So want went wrong? Here comes the list: 1. Upon entering the room, noticed a very nice dark brown sectional sofa with one cusion from another sofa (it was bright green and white). Could have been overlooked, but a bit tacky! 2. Three people in the room with a sleeper sofa and a separate bedroom. No linens for the sleeper sofa. Had to call the desk. My opinion only, but they should have known that with three people we needed the extra linen. 3. Only one roll of toilet paper in room--that three people thing again. 4. On the second day, the air conditioner was not cooling efficiently. Maintenance tried to fix it, but said the room would have to be shut down. We opted to say in the room rather than move, however, another item was added to this list. 5. Maid cleaned room, said she would bring fresh towels later. When she brought them back, they were damp. Used or poor drying? 6. First morning there were no eggs at the breakfast bar. Several people had to wait to get scrambled eggs. 7. They advertise \"Sundowners\" with beer and wine, and a \"limited bar\" on their website, however, they have no liquor license as yet and have neither. 8. There is apparently a governor on the shower handle. You couldn't take a HOT shower if you wanted to. It was, at best, a bit above lukewarm. 9. And now, the straw that broke the camel's back: We were told on check-in of the shuttle service to MGM Grand and told it ran on the hour, or if needed, call, and it would pick us up right away. The last night in Vegas, we hurried to catch the shuttle on the hour. We arrived 10 minutes early, no shuttle. Another couple was also waiting. Called the hotel and was told \"He should be on his way, if not we'll send him.\" Thanked them and sat down to wait. It's about a 10 minute trip. Sat down to wait. No shuttle. Called the desk again. \"He's on the way. Should be there soon.\" Half hour later, the shuttle showed up. Driver said he was sorry, but had to go to the airport. So, for an hour, because no one told us where the shuttle actually was, five of us stood around waiting. We could have had a drink, did a bit more touring, whatever. Instead, we waited by the pick-up point because he was supposedly going to be there \"any minute.\" Not a good way to run a railroad (or a shuttle)!

You can sometimes hear planes flying by, but it is not noisy enough to keep you from sleeping (and I am a sensitive sleeper). They cannot pick you up from the airport due to local laws, but they will drop you back off for free. Nearby are other similar-looking Suites and motels. The location is not convenient as it costs about $15 by taxi to get to the Las Vegas Strip. If you have a car though, I don't think it will be a big issue. There is a free shuttle provided every hour, at the hour to the MGM Grand Las Vegas Hotel & Casino. The front desk staff are super nice and they really go out of their way to be helpful! I would say they are one of the best hotel staff that I have ever experienced. I really want to commend them for their service. They are the highlight of this hotel. I would describe them as friendly, attentive to detail, kind, and busy! A single staff member will juggle multiple phone calls, someone trying to buy something at the store next door, and try to help you. I especially liked the black lady though I don't remember her name. I give them all a big thumbs up! The lobby is quite nice. This is a four-story building that I believe was intended to be an apartment or condo-type of thing. There is a pool (it is okay) and a couple of jacuzzis outside. And there is parking in the front which I believe is free. Because these were intended to be apartments, they are very big! We stayed in the King-size bed bedroom suite and there was a bedroom with King-size bed, a very large bathroom, a living room, a kitchen, and balcony. It was wonderful that a washer and dryer were included. You can buy detergent for $2 at Bridgemart which is basically a space next to the front desk where they have food, beverages, and other items and is run by the front desk. I would describe the furnishings as upscale middle-class. The room was very nice, but I would not call it luxury. I really liked the fact that it was a full apartment with kitchen and I think this would be a great place to stay for a week or so, if you're in Las Vegas. The only issue I had was that the toilet cover would slide to the side a bit when sitting on it and the bathroom toiletries were not top-quality. I even found a used soap at the sink. Also, the first day the cleaning staff did not come by until it was too late (around 4pm?) to clean up. They missed the second day, too. There is no room service. So we had to order food in which was fine because the front desk staff gave us delivery menus (American, Italian, Thai, etc.) and the food can be delivered direct to your room. The Thai is excellent! I was very surprised as the portions were huge, the prices cheap (all under $10), and the dishes we ordered were very tasty (almost authentic Thai and very spicy, if you ask for it). I had read here at Tripadvisor that the breakfast at the hotel was really good, but we did not experience any of it because we woke up late each morning. Breakfast takes place in a large room with a TV screen on CNBC. The room didn't look too special, but it appeared they had unlimited soda and coffee available. The guests are basically middle-class Americans. There was one thug-like type with low-hanging jeans with his somewhat trashy-looking girlfriend. But I didn't mind them too much as they seemed alright people. Anyhow, I really enjoyed my stay here. It was very comfortable and again the staff are excellent. SUMMARY: The staff at Staybridge Suites are really great and the black lady is awesome! I love her. At the prices they charge, this is a top value even in Las Vegas and I noticed two separate incidents when guests asked for long-term or frequent guest rates as they seemed to very much like the place. They were both people who apparently come often to Las Vegas, so I assume they know comparative value.
