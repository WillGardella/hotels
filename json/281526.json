I thought I would be here longer than 5 days so I wanted a cheap rate, knowing that there would be some issues. I was pleasantly surprised by this place. The only issues I really had were a faint smoke smell in the non-smoking room (I blame the person next-door who I saw smoking out the window of his non-smoking room a couple of days later), and some cigarette burns in the comforter. I don't really understand why you wouldn't replace a comforter that has several holes from cigarette burns, they can't be that expensive. Anyway none of the above is news if you've read any of the other reviews. I just wanted to write on here to say that Jessie from the staff was super friendly and very helpful.

Finding the right area to live in and the right place is even harder. The last thing you need is to worry about your temporary \"place\". I got very lucky!!!!! I have read reviews about this property and I am confused. I thought the staff was AMAZING!! Every single one of them. The Manager Brittney genuinely cares about the property, guests and staff. If you are relocating to the area and need something temporary...I cannot think of a better place. Are there smells in the hall?? Yes...there are. When each room has a kitchen...you are bound to have food odor come into the hall. I never smelled smoke. If you ask for the first floor...you are far away from the smoking floor. Some of the rooms are remodled. I was in one. Room 138. Great room! The area is fine. You have a gym, grocery store, kmart, restaurants and starbucks all within walking distance. The bus stop is only a block away. I didn't see anyone anymore sketchy than you would see in any other part of the city. It is no frills...but the rooms are clean, well appointed and the staff is great. My boss stayed here while in town and she is VERY picky...she was in an older smoking room and she did not have any complaints. My ONE complaint is that the wifi is slow but it works.

I am not the hotel snob type, but have to report something when it comes up. This hotel is one that did not make the cut. Got a good deal online, $45 + tax (go online and book thru the hotel website with code ESH10 promo code) Had to haggle with the guy about the promo code, and ended up having to show him a pdf saved on my iphone. The kid behind the counter was pretty uninformed about most topics. The room was on the 3rd floor near the elevator. The room itself is pretty basic - small basic kitchen. standard bathroom - Queen bed (average firmness, cheap sheets, but clean) very small TV, small kind of dirty chair. The first thing you notice in the hallway is a \"Fish\" smell. My hunch is some of the people staying here are cooking some smelly things. The room has a smell of cigarettes, even though it's supposed to be non-smoking. IT COMES THROUGH THE VENTILATION SYSTEM. I could smell smokey smells wafting through the vent near the front door. Lastly, the bed cover had an \"Old sweaty man\" smell that was not very nice. 3 distinctive bad smells were pretty bad. Other than the smells, the hotel is pretty average. Some kind of sketchy people were hanging out in the front part of the parking lot messing with some old windowless van. I made sure to park my car near the front entrance of the hotel. Overall, if your looking for a rock bottom deal, and can handle some pretty foul odors...go for it. Personally, I will look for a better hotel next time I come to Seattle.", "Date": "March 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cWorst hotel experience I have ever had- Read this before you book\u201d", "Author": "TravelgirlNC84", "ReviewID": "UR36856440", "Content": "First of all I want to share that I am a mellow person and not picky about much at hotels. I have never written a hotel review before, but I felt obligated to do so because I had such a bad experience. I had to stay here because I was coming to a workshop that was within walking distance, but if I ever come back I will make sure to stay elsewhere and take the bus. The front desk service and management were horrible. My roommate and I made them aware of all of the issues I will list below, ended up calling corporate, and had to beg to get any response, apology or compensation. We arrived and they had cancelled our entire room block. They said it was full and then magically found us a room half hour later (and about 20 others who had been cancelled too). However, my roommate and I had to switch rooms 3 times in the first day of arrival and stayed in a single when we booked a double- which we were charged for and had to ask twice just to take the $10 off the rate for staying in a single. Everything smells like smoke. We booked a non-smoking room, and the last straw was when my roommate walked into the room into a fresh cloud of smoke. Our once-a-week cleaning had been done and the AC messed with so obviously the housekeepers had been smoking in our room while working. Disgusting since I am allergic. There was no toilet paper available for an entire week. We asked for more and their response was that they had already been to the Cash-n-Carry twice that day. We had to provide our own for our first week there. My roommate asked for a washcloth and was handed a raggedy dishcloth for her face because she was told they were out. We were in Seattle during the record breaking heatwave and our AC did not work- only the fan and would cut off without warning. The front desk's response was that the mantenience man was in the hospital. Our fridge leaked on the inside and got all of our food wet. Half of the washers in the laundry room were out of order our first week of the stay. We asked for a bus map or any information about the closest bus stop and they couldn't help us. We were told we would be charged half our stay the first week and the rest upon checkout, however, they charged the entire stay to my credit card early. I could go on and on about these issues and the worst part is that not one person seemed to care- from the front desk all the way to corporate. We called numerous people and were disconnected, put on hold, connected to other managers who could do nothing, and were told we would be called back and we never got a response. I knew someone who stayed here the previous summer and had an issue with bed bugs and she said the management didn't seem to care then, so I should have been warned but gave it the benefit of the doubt. Please don't go here if you expect any kind of normal hotel service or necessities because they won't provide it. Absolutely the most ridiculous hotel experience I have ever had. Other helpful info: Aurora Ave. is sketchy, especially at night- which is the main road outside the hotel. There are a few places outside the hotel within walking distance that are good to visit, like Albertson's grocery across the street and a yogurt place called Melon in the same shopping area. There are not too many restaurants within walking distance other than a fast seafood place (good service there- I think it's called Ivan's or Ivar's?), an Outback, and a Starbucks on Aurora. The 358 bus on Aurora will take you downtown Seattle, which is a much better experience than this area. This bus can be a little sketchy, so only take it during the day if you are solo. Another fun place to catch a bus to is Green Lake Park, which is not too far away.", "Date": "August 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eugene, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cCheap, decent hotel\u201d", "Author": "vanwinkle50", "ReviewID": "UR30754905", "Content": "We stayed here while visiting family that lived near by.

It was my second time staying with Extended Stay for a short term stay and I was not disappointed. The area offers a Albertsons just a short walk from the facility. There is a Kmart there as well. It is about a 5 minute walk to these stores. The facility is located one street off of busy/noisy Aurora Ave. and is well insulated from the road noise with the shopping center in front of it. This is a new facility and everything was top of the line. The rooms are big enough to hold 4 suitcases and 4 carry on's. The bed is a bit hard to my liking, but it was comfortable. You need extra pillows? No problem. The shower was outstanding and the bathroom was large. The kitchen area was perfect. Watch out though if you use the coffee maker, you need to put that on the stove or you will burn the counter top. Someone did that before I was there. There are bellman carts available in the laundry vending area during office hours. If you have a early check out you will have to take your luggage out piece by piece.

In addition, they treat their customers like they don't trust them for a second. They charge your credit card for the whole stay on the first night.
