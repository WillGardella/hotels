The Hotel Delambre was recommended to us, and we'd like to recommend it to you. The hotel is bright, attractive and friendly. The owner/manager was able to welcome me by name when I arrived, and greeted me by name throughout our three days there. A nice touch. The rooms are clean, the bed was comfortable, the shower worked ... All you'd really want in a city centre hotel. The situation, too, is excellent. In a little one-way street full of small restaurants, delicatessens, a locksmith and a laundry. It's a place where people live and go about their business. Minutes from the Gare Montparnasse, the Boulevard Montparnasse and the Vavin metro station (on Ligne 4.) Our one little giggle was the breakfast. By the time we arrived, cups and bowls were in short supply and the waitress hadn't yet refilled the buffet. But not a problem: we took breakfast in a nearby cafe on the following mornings. We'll certainly go back.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLovely start to our honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "gessicaj", "ReviewID": "UR123021534", "Content": "Paris was our first stop on our 4 city 2 country honeymoon trip.

She gave us a map of the city and made note of some great palces to visit. She pointed out where we were on the map and the best way to get around the city. Finally when it was time to check in, she took down our information and gave us our key and we hopped onto the small elevator and made our way to our room. The room was a bit small but it was clean and charming. The bathroom seemed like it had been recentluy updated. It was equipped with a/c, TV but unfortunately no mini bar. We were hoping for a small fridge so that we could store some of the store bought food that we had. The hotel's within walking distance of a few supermarkets, several restaurants and cafe's and a shopping mall. The 2 subway stations located a stones throw away make it even easier to get around the city though I'd recommend walking to your destinations as its a lovely scenic way to get to see the city and take in its beauty.

We we stayed only two nights at this hotel. The hotel is well located in the city and accommodations were comfortable. However, it lacks good customer service. Upon arrival, the check in employee failed to assist us with the luggage and was unsure as to where exactly our room was in the building (\"between the 4th or 5th floor...\") The hotel staff did not describe the particularities of the services offered at the hotel, and was unreasonable and unfamiliar with the hotel management functions in the resolution of issues, such as the one that arose during our stay. The reasonable prices for the rooms for a 3 star hotel influenced our decision to stay here, considering our short stay. But it seems that the price is THE catch, and that the management uses any excuse to make extra money from their guests. The hotel offers WiFi at an extra cost, which we paid. They gave us a small strip of paper with the password and we were not warned by the staff that if it gets lost we would have to pay double for the same service. However, we kept the little strip of paper with the \"secret\" password on a table in the room and left for a walk. When we returned it was gone! Apparently it was trashed during the hotel cleaning service. We explained exactly what happened to the reception employee. He was less than accommodating, was unreasonable, and unwilling to provide any customer satisfaction resolution. He said he was \"just an employee there\" and that was forced by the management to charge us again. He suggested that we talk to the management the next day. The next morning we left without being able to meet with the manager to resolve the issue. The experience left us with a bitter taste of what should be considered a 3 star hotel, and though the price for the service is affordable, the real issue remains on the principle of serving us well and fairly as their guests.

We couldn't have asked for a better hotel stay. Our conceirge, Jean Paul, was wonderful - so pleasant and helpful - he really made our stay extremely pleasant. The hotel itself was very nicely decorated, very clean beyond a fault, and in such a convenient area - a few minutes walking distance to 2 Metro lines, and right in the heart of a lively bistro area frequented by hip locals who live and socialize there. We felt immediately at home, safe and comfortable. Just down the street was a Saturday morning farmer's market, a wine shop, cheese shop, and bakery. We were in heaven!

For what you get, (pleasant Paris 3-star comfort) that is an excellent price. Good-sized (for Paris) rooms, very clean, well-decorated. The location is outstanding for a Paris veteran who is familiar with the Metro, and is not on their first trip with a necessity to be staying right next to (e.g) the Louvre, Champs Elysees, or Notre Dame. Hotel Delambre's Montparnasse location in the quieter 14th has lots of hidden history, excellent cafes for people-watching, great food (Dome, Coupole, etc), and some terrific historic walks. With Vavin, Edgar Quinet, and the huge hub Montparnasse Bienvenue Metro stops close-by an experienced \"metro-rat\" like me can get anywhere in Paris in just minutes - even CDG airport quickly on the RER-B at nearby Pl Denfert Rochereau - while at the same time escaping some of the millions of international tourists clogging the Disneyland-like and more expensive theater setting that sometimes is central Paris during high season. Montparnasse is not necessarily for the Paris \"virgin\" tourist that is here for the first time to see the Mona Lisa - it is more for the Paris-lover / veteran traveler who wants instead to get more of a feeling of what the \"real\" (if there is such a thing) Paris is like now, yet be right in the middle of Paris history in the art and cafe \"crazy years\" of the early 20th century. Hotel Delambre's staff speaks English, is very helpful with suggestions, reservations, etc. and there is a night clerk on duty to buzz when you come crawling in at 4am. Good petite dejeuner in the lobby but I always skip it and hit one of the cafes nearby like Select on Blvd Montparnasse or Cafe de la Place/Bistro Petit Rotonde up the street at Pl Fernand Mourlot so I can relax on a terrace and people- watch.

As other customers already said in this site the mini suite is in fact two good sized rooms connected, a bathroom (with no curtains in the bathtub and shower!). There is no fridge which can be considered a problem to those like us that decided not to have breakfast at the hotel. Anyway not a big problem that would make us give up staying at this good and well located hotel. The second experience was not that nice as we were only three this time (my husband went back home before us). When I booked the hotel I asked for a triple, they told me that it would cost me 107 euros. So I figured that they had a triple room. But that was not the case at all!! When we arrived back to the hotel we received a double room with a spare bed, it wouldn't be a problem if the room could accomodate it easily, which was not the case at all!!! The spare bed stayed between the table we used to eat and the other bed, it was almost impossible to pass from one part of the room to another and every morning I had to push the bed to one side, almost putting it out of the room (it would stay very near the door) in order to have breakfast. I understand that the hotel should have told me at the time of the booking that they did not have a triple room, in this case I would have searched for another hotel with a triple room for the second stay. So If you are travelling in a group of three avoid staying in Delambre. If not I consider the delambre a good choice, in spite of not having fridges.", "Date": "August 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Strasbourg", "Title": "\u201cRoom 7 - very nice\u201d", "Author": "hobbit_baggins", "ReviewID": "UR8215391", "Content": "This hotel was recommended to us by some friends who often come to Paris to visit family. The hotel is pleasant and quiet and no suprises for a 3-star Paris hotel. Prices are correct and breakfast was standard and served nicely. The hotel staff were very friendly with that owner-behind-the-desk feel. The location is excellent with easy access to the Vavin metro station or about 10 minutes walk to the Jardins de Luxembourg. There are lots of places to eat along the Blvd Montparnasse and, if you like exploring, you can also walk into what was the old village of Montparnasse and find restaurants and bars there too. Room 7 was very nice. It is perched on the rooftops in the courtyard behind the hotel and accessible via a covered terrace. You can sit out on the terrace if you like. It is about normal Paris 3* room size with a spaceous bathroom. The room was quiet and airy and we slept very well.

On the positive side, the Hotel is convenient to the Edgar Quinet metro, but it is rather removed from the main attracts of Paris. There was really nothing to do around the hotel, at least for us. For two people it was 105 E, which I guess is not too bad for Paris but our room was laughably small. The door almost hit the bed when you opened it. Despite leaving a do not disturb sign on the door each day we were there, the housekeeping ignored it and cleaned the room anyway. Also the bed we had was incredibly uncomfortable. We both had difficult sleeping and my fiancee felt sore the next morning. Our worst experience was one night when we could hear the \"amorous activities\" of one of our neighbors. Granted, this is really not the hotel's fault, but it gives you an idea of how thin the walls are. If noise bothers you, find somewhere else. The room was pretty clean, as well as the bathroom. I would try to find something more centrally located and nicer, even if I had to pay a little more.", "Date": "January 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cBasic budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "My2sentsworth", "ReviewID": "UR6135167", "Content": "This hotel is billed as a three star hotel, however, it just a basic budget hotel.

They did charge for the breakfast (8 Euros) but we left early everyday and did not take advantage of the pastry shopes on the street.
