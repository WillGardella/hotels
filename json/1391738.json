We had a fridge in our room that we filled with water and soft drinks for the week to save some money. The hotel has a 24hr cvs pharmacy next door that was great for picking up snacks. I would say this hotel cant be beat for the value. One small drawback is that there is only 1 shuttle to Universal at 10am that comes back at 7:25pm so you have to plan your day around it but it worked out well for us. Free wifi also a bonus.

This is going to be a long review... THE ROOM The room was lovely. Very well maintained, everything in good condition (as it is a relatively new hotel), spacious and welcoming. We had two queen beds - and that was booked as a standard room so we were extremely happy with this. Nice size TV with plenty of channels - they even had the Manchester United game on which kept my partner happy. Lots of storage space for clothes and suitcases. Microwave and fridge in room which was handy for when we were too worn out by the end of the day to face the public at dinner time. Air conditioning worked well. Hairdryer, ironing board and iron all included in room - very glad I didn't bring my hairdyer along as this one did a decent job. Nice, clean bathroom with powerful shower and regular bath. BIG mirror. THE STAFF The front desk, housekeeping and maintenance staff were all so good at their jobs and nothing was too much. They were all so cheerful and very helpful. Not much else to say about them really! HOTEL FEATURES The pool is a reasonable size and well maintained. There are plenty of sunloungers and pool towels always available. As there is so much to do in Orlando we only went to the pool once during our two weeks. There is a bar in the pool area which has nice food. There is also a jacuzzi which is just bliss at the end of the day - and it is open until 11pm. The hotel is interlinked with the Springhill Suites next door (you have to walk through the pool area to get to it which takes less than a minute). This is where the 'gym' is located. The 'gym' consists of a selection of weights and some cardio machines - no floor space or resistance machines for a proper work-out but enough to keep you active during your stay. The Springhill also houses a coffee bar which serves Starbucks beverages throughout the morning. It is also where you will find the computers for free internet access and the Expedia Local Expert desk. This was probably the most useful thing to us on our holiday as they know everything about what to do in Orlando. Michael Brugnone ran the desk on most days and he was extremely knowledgable. He helped us arrange tickets to see an Orlando Magic game (which I highly recommend) and, as it is a Seaworld hotel, he arranged our FREE QuickQueue tickets for the rides at Seaworld - along with many other things. He is a very helpful man indeed. While at this desk you may end up chatting to someone from the Marriott Vacation Club. This is all about getting involved in a timeshare thing. They take you to the local vacation club, show you around the apartments, offer you deals and try to convince you to get involved. When it's all over (approximately 2 hours) and you've managed to convince them you don't want to get involved, you get a $100 gift card to take off your hotel bill! This was handy as we had ordered room service from the pool bar, TGI Friday's (which is nextdoor to the hotel) and I had used the dry cleaning service. Then we used the remainder in the hotel shop. Also, if you do not use room service they allow you to redeem it against park tickets. Not only that but the rep at the hotel will give you voucher books to spend at the outlets which also came in handy. LOCATION This hotel was in the perfect location for us. We did not hire a car so used the public transport. We bought 14-day iRide passes from our Virgin rep in advance, but you can get these from the Expedia desk. This got us to Seaworld, the shopping areas and a couple of water parks. There are shuttle buses from the hotel to all the other parks excluding Disney. It's a little too far to get a taxi to Disney everytime so we jumped on the Lynx 50 which cost $2 a ride. There is a Publix supermarket a 10-minute walk away. There is absolutely no need to hire a car unless you plan on going places further afield. ISSUES There were only two problems we came across on our holiday. 1) Our in-room phones stopped calling local and international numbers and we could only call the front desk. This only happened a few days before we left so we weren't too fussed. 2) There was not an in-room safe. We kept our passports locked in a safe at the front desk and every day my partner had to take his MacBook downstairs to be locked in the office which had CCTV. The UK equivalent of this hotel is a Thistle hotel. But this is even better. You don't have people running around carrying your bags for you - but the service is fantastic and we would deifinitely stay again.

The morning breakfast is fine, although a little more fresh fruit would be a great improvement. But each morning a nice selection of bread and meat and eggs. You can get discounts to the dining at the SeaWorld restaurants as well. And right across the street there is a Thai restaurant, a good sushi place, a Denny's and a TGIF. We rented a car and went to Downtown Disney one night and Universal CityWalk the other. It's very easy to get around from the Fairfield Marriott. You could pay more to stay at the nearby Renaissance or one of the better hotels in the area, but for a short trip with a lot of time at the parks, the Fairfield is easier on the wallet and you can upgrade your vacation in other ways.

We had our baby (8 months ) with us and staff bent over backwards to meet all our needs for the baby. Its price is defintely value for money and it offers everything you need. The only criticism I would have and it is minor is that the breakfast is a bit similar and limited after 14 nights and to get fresh fruit there has to be a conference party in or you have to be up really early. It's ok though for a continental breakfast. If you want something they have acrossthe other side in the springhill suites the staff will get it or you can eat there as its the same hotel. We saved money moving as this hotel was slightly cheaper than the 4 points and despite paying an admin fee to move, we saved as the previous hotel was room only and as far as facilities and comfort are concerned there was no contest.

The only thing I can say that would be negative, is that the water in the rooms had that light \"sulfur\" odor and taste. Bring bottled water for brushing your teeth and drinking.

On check-in, our rooms were ready but they were unable to have all rooms on the same floor. 2 rooms were together and 1 was on a different floor but this did not bother us. Check-in was easy and quick. Front desk staff were very helpful and friendly at all times. Not once did we feel that we were annoying them by asking for help or asking access to the safe behind the front desk. On entering the room for the first time we were very impressed. All looked very clean and still looked like a new hotel. Bed linen was clean and fresh. View from our room looked onto SeaWorld which was also great. In general, housekeeping was done everyday however it seemed that they came either too late (ie we arrived back at 4pm some days and the room still had not been done but was evetually done after we came back from dinner), or it was done too early (ie we wanted a lay in but housekeeping was knocking on the door at 9:30am). Housekeeping could be improved. Like I said when we originally entered the room for the first time it all looked clean but during our stay it was gradually noticed that little small things are being skipped over. By this I mean the carpets are not hoovered right up to the edges and you do notice dust gathering. Also dust under the flat screen TVs was present. The only other thing was that when you sit on the toilet you do notice grime under the sink rim. Apart from this there was no mould around the bath and the decor of the room was very good. I hope they can sort this out because these are the sorts of things that start the reviews going bad... Breakfast is free in the morning. Our family are vegetarian so we only ate serial/toast/yogurt so it was good for us. However the fact that it ends at 9:30am every day means you can't have a free breakfast and have a lay in at the same time. Staff at breakfast are very welcoming and friendly and they keep the tables clean quickly. We did not experience any long queues whether we arrived at 8am or 9:15am. We used the Guest Services in the sister hotel next door. Michael was very helpful in getting us our SeaWorld/Busch/Aquatica multi tickets and he also handed us our free Quick-Queue tickets which were good for our visit to SeaWorld. The location of the hotel is very good. Right on International Drive opposite SeaWorld's but you would need to walk or take the shuttle to the entrance to SeaWorl. Very easy by car to Florida Mall, Outlets, Wallmart, the Turnpike for Miami, SeaWorld, I4 and Universal and the MCO airport. There are plenty of eating places nearby within walking distance (however we had a hire car so never walked anywhere). Pool area was clean and welcoming. There is a small snacks bar at the pool which was good and plenty of towels to use. One of the days the pool area was closed due to refurbishment. We got 2 days notice for this and I feel this should have been noted on the Marriott web site where I booked these rooms. We were at the parks that day anyway so it did not bother us however we did hear others complaining about it in the lifts. Gym was used a couple of times which is basic but still worth going to. We did not get the sitution of many kids running around in the corridoors late at night which you normally get at most hotels. Check-out was quick and easy also and it was mentioned to us how appreciated it was that we stayed there. The hotel does not have any type of of security gate at the complex entrance like other hotels do. You can just drive in to the car park, however the hotel complex did feel safe to be in and around. The only thing we did not like was that in 3 of our rooms were left coins out and housekeeping would take them. It says in the room info booklet not to leave money out so we can't really complain. However in my room I left approx $5 coins out next to the TV (as I do not like to carry coins) and they were taken. The same time these coins were taken I also left approx $5 worth of quaters in another part of the room next to a wall and next to a Washing detergent bottle as we wanted to wash our clothes before our return. It would be obvious that those quarters were for me to use in the laundry room but these coins were also taken. These coins were gradually built up in a pile over approx 8 days before they were taken. Overall, I would stay here again over any other hotel. We have always stayed at the Marriott Village before but the constant traffic congestion around that hotel put us off this time and therefore decided to stay here.

Since the hotel is located on International Drive, I needed a hotel that was close to everything. For the most part, Fairfield Inn at SeaWorld was a good choice, but it wasn't without its flaws. Here are the pros and cons: PROS: Very clean and modern hotel with the usual bells and whistles. Opened in 2009, and is located at International Drive and CFP (Central Florida Parkway). Theme parks within driving distance, including SeaWorld and Aquatica. Guest room was very clean, the pool area was attractive (even though I decided not to go swimming), and I got to check in early. Guest room included a flat-screen TV, microwave, mini-fridge (as a tradition, I try to save money on meals), comfy bed and a spacious bathroom. Hotel staff was friendly and courteous for the most part, even though I don't remember all their names. Plenty of stores and restaurants within walking distance, including a Publix store. CONS: Have fun waiting for the I-Drive Trolley in the scorching hot Florida sun. There weren't enough trolleys that came on time, so I had to wait a while for one to arrive. The breakfast area was a zoo, and there wasn't enough variety. I basically spent the next two days having breakfast at McDonald's. The video arcade was very small, and the Family Guy pinball machine had a technical malfunction. Your room key is required to get anywhere within the hotel and the neighboring SpringHill Suites. VERY annoying. You can only get wired internet in the guest room, and the computers at the business center were slow as heck. The A/C in my room kept turning itself on every 20 minutes, but thankfully I managed to turn it off. I enjoyed my stay at Fairfield Inn at SeaWorld, but I won't be returning to this hotel.

Across the street to Seaworld and Aquatica. Close enough to see the fireworks each night from the pool. A few turns off the Central Parkway to I-4 and over to Disney. A right turn down International Drive to all sorts of restaurants, shows and entertainment. (Be sure to see the magic show at Wonderworks.) CVS and TGIF are right in the parking lot area. Staff is very friendly, accomdating and aims to please. The hotel and pool area are clean. Pool is shared with Springhill Suites and has a great kids splash area. They served food and drinks outside by the pool. Breakfast is complimentary. Now the negatives: First impressions mean a lot. Upon arrival we were assigned a king sized room. The room was quite small and not very accomodating for 2 adults and 2 active kids for 7 days. I went back to the front desk and asked them what had happened to my reservation for a suite with a sofa bed. They said my reservation was not for a suite, which confused me because that was the room I reconfirmed the evening before arrival. The staff changed our room, but informed me the it would cost $14.00 more per night. I was tired from driving and agreed to pay the extra. After a good nights sleep I decided to go back down to the front desk and tell them I was not going to pay the extra room rate since I knew that the room I booked was a suite and somewhere between reservations and front desk something was lost. They agreed to take off the extra for that night, but I wanted to make sure I would not be charged for the remainder of the nights either and they agreed to the original rate quoted at the reservation. They were very good about it and I was pleased by their friendly attitude. Breakfast was decent, but the hot items needed to be reheated in the microwave. It's hard to serve hot foods to dozens of guest. My biggest problem was the WiFi connection in the room. It is not truly wireless. You must plug a connecting plug into your computer and if you cannot get connected you call a toll free number and they give you instructions on how to reconfigure your pc for their wireless. BIG MISTAKE on my part. Changing my settings resulted in completly crashing my pc and upon arrival home, had to completly reset my laptop back to factory settings. It was a big mess. I should have just used the pc's they had in the business center or gone to the breakfast area where wireless seemed to be working. You also only get a 24 hour certificate and must renew this every day or you loose the connection. So if you want to surf the net in your jammies, forget it. The next problem was on the day before we left. We were a bit disappointed to come back late at night from a hot, sweaty day at Disney and find that they did not clean our room or provide us with clean towels. The front desk had the security guard bring us fresh towels. When we check out the next day they did give us a $40.00 credit for not having cleaned the room. The last thing we were hit with was a short sales pitch about rebooking the hotel or a Marriott condo resort timeshare for a later date. The offer wasn't bad but I wasn't sure I wanted to return to that hotel, so we did not buy into the package. This Marriott hotel was a far cry from the one we had stayed at in Cocoa Beach just a few nights before.

The pool area is smaller than it looks in the photo's, but the hot tub is a brilliant way to end a busy day. We walked to Seaworld once (It is farther than it looks because the entrance is on the opposite side. Best to catch an I-Ride there than walk, if you don't have a car). It is an easy 12 minute walk to Aquatica. There isn't a footpath initially, but the grass verge is wide and easy to walk on. The I-Ride is fine, but there is no way of knowing when it will arrive. Very hot waiting! They should come every 20 minutes. The quick-queues for Seaworld are the best. Book it the day before you want to go to Seaworld. Breakfast at hotel is basic, but free. It is mostly continental style (waffles, muffins, toast, juice, yoghurts, bagels, etc). Great start to the day - but a bit monotonous after a while. There is a McDonalds, Wendy's, and KFC across the road, and a Pizza hut at the pool side. The pizza hut combo meals are about $7.49 each and really nice! . TGI is in front of the hotel - a lovely place to eat. They do a three course special for $12 approx - too much to eat! The CVS on-site is great for basic grocery's and pharmacy. It also has an emergency mini medical clinic should you need one. There is a shuttle bus roughly every hour to Aquatica and Seaworld. It does one other hotel pick-up before dropping you at the parks. A shuttle to Universal leaves hotel at 9.40 and return pick up time is 6pm. You are tied to those times, but it is free. A cab ride one way is about $17 if you use Mears. You can easily catch a cab at Seaworld. The one the hotel organises is $25. Get to the parks early to miss the queues! Or stay until closing. Our average queue time was 15 minutes because we did it this way. Otherwise you could queue for well over 60 minutes for each ride! Have fun!

We usually stay at 5* hotels but since we were traveling with other family we had to find a hotel that would suit their budget and our \"need\" to stay in a nice, comfortable place. We stayed at a studio, which I was pleasantly surprised. The studio had a living room with a sofa bed ,plasma TV and a desk. In the room we had a king size bed and a plasma TV. We had plenty of storage space. The bathroom was very simple with hairdryer, some toiletries and very clean. The location was very good, situated in a quiet part of International Dr. , close to supermarkets, malls , walking distance to Sea World and 15, 20 minutes to Disney Parks. T.G.I. Friday is adjacent to the hotel and they deliver to your room. Also supermarkets are very close so we just bought some healthy snacks in the supermarket. The bus stop that takes you all the way \"up and down\" in International Dr. is right in front of the hotel. Very convenient for those who don't have a car. The breakfast was included and it was basically, eggs (each day in a different style) , yogurt, fruit salad, bagel,toast, cereal, coffee, milk, tea and orange juice. They do have a starbucks coffee counter at the lobby, but honestly it is not a \"true\" starbucks shop they just have a counter and use the starbucks coffee and charge the same. I tried but it didn't taste the same to me. What I liked the most about this hotel is that comparing to others in the same price range this is by far the best. It is very new and the service surprised me for a 2 1/2* I would recommend to get a room as far as possible from the elevator ( they have the in site laundry next to the elevator) , this is a family hotel so be prepared to hear kids talking really loud and sometimes screaming etc... We don't have kids yet so kids screaming sometimes bother us, and in the room we stayed we didnt hear anything (we got the last room in the end of a long hallway).

We vacillated between wanting the grandiose resort experience, and saving money, until we finally decided on the Fairfield. Deciding factors were the promise of the QuickQue (like a Fast Pass for the rides at Seaworld) and the convenience of the location; Fairfield is across the street from Seaworld, Discovery Cove, and Aquatica, the 3 parks to which we had purchased tickets, and Orlando traffic is notorious. Things you should know: The Fairfield shares amenities with it's sister hotel, the Springfield Inn. Think of two towers separated by a common pool. The concierge is located at the Springfield. They only have 100 QuickQues for both buildings. If you want a QuickQue, you have to wait in a (sometimes considerable) line at the Springfield Inn in the early morning to request a QuickQue for the next day. On the day we arrived, they had already given out all the available passes. We did get QuickQues for other days, because we arrived at the concierge desk early. They will only give out the passes for the next day, so you have to go each morning to obtain one for the next day. Also, shuttle buses are inconveniently timed. Although they advertise a shuttle to Universal Studios, there is only one AM pick-up (at 9:40, so you arrive well past the park's 9:00 opening to meet the crowds, and one PM take-back shuttle. Shuttles to Seaworld and Aquatica run more frequently, but don't expect Disney bus schedules; these shuttles definitely don't pick up each 15 min. A $4.00-plus-tip 5 minute cab ride is more convenient to get back or forth without the constraints of the shuttle bus. Also, even with the hotel being across the street from the parks, it often takes a 20 min shuttle trip, because the shuttle stops to pick up guests from other hotels. The pool was much nicer than expected; some websites erroneously show a picture of a plain, rectangular pool listed under this hotel's address. The picture is really of a different Springfield Inn in Orlando, not the one listed at Seaworld. The poolside grill does not open until 3:00 pm on weekdays, and it is slow service, but the entire atmosphere, with the palm trees, tropical music pumped from the speakers, and the sound of the fountain's running water from the water features/kid's zone, is lovely and relaxing. On our trip, the pool never appeared to become overcrowded - maybe everyone was at the parks, considering the pool is shared by both the Fairfield and the Springfield Inns. Although we asked for 'early check-in', our room was not ready until normal check-in time at 3:00 pm. But check-out time was a fabulous 12 noon! Rooms were clean and bright, and the queen beds were much appreciated when we considered that the more expensive hotels were providing double beds. However, the windows faced the parking lot, and we could hear the trucks rumble in the street and noisy people coming into the hotel from their cars. The morning complimentary breakfast was a true money saver. Don't come past 8:15 or you may not get a table; it gets quite busy in the eating lounge. They had 2 waffle irons to make your own waffles, but the wait could be 10 minutes. We usually opted for the pre-made scrambled egg disks (one morning was hard-boiled eggs, very strange morning fare), a meat (sausage or ham), oatmeal or cold cereal. There was also fruit, yogurt, bagels and bread to toast, juice and coffee. Very nice. A CVS across the parking lot supplied us with very convenient staples; a mini-fridge in the room kept the beverages cold. The TGI Fridays also in the parking lot was convenient and excellent. Staff was friendly and helpful in a limited capacity; don't expect a full-service hotel that will awe you when you walk in.

We checked into the hotel around 2PM and mentioned we'd be going to Sea World that night with our annual passes as we dont like to take the small children in the heat of the day.

They were rude about it, and very \"not our fault, blame Expedia\"... but I had to point out to them that they were CHOOSING to have Expedia run their concierge. I just think having a concierge desk close in the afternoon is crazy... especially in Orlando where folks spend their nights at theme parks, restaurants, looking for things to do, etc, etc... (Isnt the purpose of a concierge desk to help people looking for information / things to do?) When I told the \"Manager on Duty\" that the primary reason we came to this hotel was for the \"Quick Queue\" passes the hotel promises their guests, he told me that they only have a few to give out each day, and they go first thing in the morning anyway.

There are two waffle makers (regular and chocolate waffles), bagels, yogurt, toast, fruit, oatmeal, muffins, cereals, orange and apple juice, milk, coffee, tea, etc. There were a few other hot items - one morning was eggs and breakfast potatoes, the other morning was ham and eggs. The eggs were just these circular disks that I didn't try, because it didn't look very appetizing, and there were plenty of other choices anyways. Staff was very friendly and helpful. At breakfast, there was a staff member making balloon animals and such for all the kids. Our kids got a real kick out of that! A great feature was the Quick Queue passes for SeaWorld. However, on the morning we were visiting, there was a computer glitch, which caused us to wait on line for quite a while (30+ minutes), and we ended up having to leave our info and return to get the passes. Then, once you are in SeaWorld, you have to go to another window to turn the passes in to get the actual bracelets. It's a bit of legwork to skip the lines, but worth it to bypass the lines for a few main attractions.

The breakfast was basic - more cereals than cooked stuff but Denny's and other places are within walking distance. The gym also was great! New equipment and well maintained. If I return to this area I'd happily stay here again. My only criticism: only having 24 hour free internet in the hotel room. I think it should extend for the length of the time the room is booked for. Otherwise, very good hotel for price and great, well-serviced location.

I have stayed in the general area of this hotel 4 times this month and out of the other stays this month, this has been by far the best hotel. The hotel is very clean. The furniture and decor is very moden from the lobby to the guest rooms. The room smelled clean and fresh and looked clean and fresh.Bathroom is a good size. I had a King Suite which has a mini fridge and microwave as well as a seperate sitting area with desk, couch, chair and flat screen tv. The bed was comfortable and had another flat screen tv in that area. The pool area was nice. A great place for families with young kids to have fun in. A game room and a nice pool side reasturant as well with quick service. The hotel offers a small free breakfast in the mornings with your basics. Juice, coffee, yogurt, breads, fruits, waffles etc. Nothing special but it does the job and being free will save you money. The hotel desk staff was very friendly and very helpful. When I asked for suggestions on where to eat with a 5 year old they printed out a list of places that were offering \"kids eat free\" options for that evening. Other times when I needed some thing I was helped quickly and with a smile. I only have 2 small complaints about the hotel is that the free internet is wired so your stuck at the desk to do work on your laptop unless you stretch the cord as far as you can to maybe sit on the couch in an uncomfortable manner. In a hotel as moden as this and as nice as this they should go the extra mile and get wireless internet in the rooms so that people can sit where they want in their rooms to get their work done. Also their little shop downstairs with drinks etc is way to high on their prices. A little frozen meal that costs $1.98 at Walmart was over $5.00 downstairs. Every thing was over priced. Do yourself a favor and don't buy from their shop, go over to CVS which is right there. More expensive then walmart but still far cheaper then the hotel.If it weren't for the internet and shop prices, I would give this hotel a huge A+. Despite these two issues I will return in the future.

The family room is a good size and easily suitable for a family with two children. The hotel has a laundry which could allow you to take fewer clothes and give more room for all the purchases from the premier outlets - clothes and shoes are excellent value. The breakfast is relaxed and the helpers friendly. You do get a bit fed up with the same breakfast choices but that would be true in any budget hotel. The hotel caters for businessmen and convention goers as well as families on holiday. The premium shopping outlets are at either end of international drive and have similar shops but for the real bargain hunters with a car try the outlets at Kissmee - a bit more run down but perhaps better bargains. We hired a car and you really do need one to get around. The alamo car hire rep makes every effort to get you to upgarde to a bigger car but the bottom of the range \"compact\" car was plenty big enough for 4/5. Parking at both disney and universal costs about $15 per day (there is a bus from the hotel but its $8 each and you are limited to the return times) - although if you go to disney after about 6 pm parking is free. We found that a late arrival at the park on a day when it was open until midnight was a great way to do the rides without the ques.

We thought this new property right by SeaWorld would be a nice compromise location in case we decided to visit Universal. . And, yes, the location is great. Turned out we only went to WDWorld, and because of the proximity to the Central Florida Pkwy exit on I-4 and Exit 67 - Epcot Centre Drive, back and forth between hotel and theme park parking lot was almost always 10~15 mins. That's a lot faster than Disney transportation. . While the combined property (the Fairfield Inn/Suites is combined with a Springhill Suites) has a semi-themed pool, that I thought would be some fun, we never used it since it was so cold when we visited. The grounds were quite nice and the proximity of a 24-hr CVS, a Wendy's, a Friday's and a Chevron and a strip mall, made the location quite convenient. .

The beds were very comfy and very quiet at night even though the hotel was very full. The bathroom is of good size with bath and shower and plenty of space to store things. The pool area is great especially for children with the splash area. The food and drink at the pool bar is very reasonably priced. Locally there are a few restaurants. We did have a car which proved very useful as we were able to get to Disney in 15 to 20 mins door to door ! Wal-Mart is very near for any necessities and of course for driving to the outlet malls (Premium Outlets is a mere 5 min drive from the hotel) and Florida mall. We also drove to Clearwater and Honeymoon Island (absolutely gorgeous). What we found was staying at this quieter end of I Drive is that it is easier to get to places as the I-4 is easier to get to than other places on I-Drive. In fact, getting to Disney and back was as quick staying here than using Disney transport when we have stayed in Disney properties in the past. The hotel staff were very friendly and the room was always cleaned very well. You also get a good view of Seaworld fireworks at night and the brilliant Aquatica water park is a 10 minute walk away (though we drove there - only $12 to park) as we had a 'stroller' and there aren't pavements all the way. The included breakfast was adequate as there was always something that the children would eat which is great. Having to go out each day for breakfast is a pain especially when you want an early start at the parks, so this is a good thing at this hotel.

My husband and I have decided that if we need to go back again we'll definitely stay here again especially if we come back with our little one.", "Date": "September 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Turin, Italy", "Title": "\u201cFully recommended!\u201d", "Author": "etroconi", "ReviewID": "UR43083628", "Content": "If you're going to Orlando to visit the parks, or in business plan, I think this place is perfect for everything.

( It cost $59.) It had a king bed, and a 32 in. flat screen TV, which my husband loved. The mattress was comfortable. The breakfast was all you could ask for with make-your-own- waffles and a large assortment of other things. There was fruit, different yogurts, cereal, bagels, donuts, and very good coffee. The best part was we could see the fireworks at Seaworld from our window when we checked in.

One of two booked rooms wasn't ready by 6pm when I checked in 2. Room had faulty lighting which was _never_ fixed during my stay 3. Housekeeping failed to clean room first day and was late in cleaning on day 2 4. I had items stolen from my room -- *** NOT A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE On the plus side, the staff were very friendly and the hotel amenities rated about 8/10. The pool was very nice and it did have internet in the room (NO WiFi though). Note: There is no safe in the room nor at the front desk. There are no security cameras anywhere on property, either. The management tried to address items 1-3 by giving me half off one room for one day, which was really just a token gesture if you think about it. Most importantly, though, was the theft. I had two small bags of electronics (hand-held gaming systems) and a laptop stolen from the room on the day I checked out. My family and I went to the pool and we took most of our items but my sons accidentally left their belongings in one of the rooms. The room was locked and a hotel staffer entered the room about two hours after I left. The entry by the staffer was expected since I had checked out; however, upon finding my stuff in the room the staffer should have contacted the front desk and had them taken from the room. Instead, he took the electronics (and left the other bag untouched) and then just locked the room. When I figured out that my sons had left their belongings in the room about 3pm, I returned to the room and then discovered that the items were stolen. It was a traumatic experience for my pre-teen sons. Of course, I spoke with the hotel management, who were very concerned, but that's about it. They filed a report with Marriott, which led to a claim being filed at the corporate level. I also had the police come by and I submitted a report. In the following weeks, Marriott Claims said that they weren't liable for the theft since there was no proof of anything (that I had the items and that they were at fault). It wasn't until the police made an arrest and I wrote a letter to Marriott Corporate that they re-opened the case and subsequently compensated me for the loss. All told, the hotel should have recognized their fault up front and at least made an effort to compensate me. It's horrible that I lost $1300 worth of items and it took over a month and an arrest for them to give me anything. I would have been happy with a hotel credit for the lost amount so I could use it at another Marriott hotel. Instead, I had to go on the offensive to receive compensation. I love the Marriott properties and will stay at another Marriott, but this particular hotel is now on my \"do not stay here\" list, despite its proximity to Seaworld and the rates. I expected more from a Marriott and this place just doesn't meet those standards. -R", "Date": "September 1, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Fairfield Inn & Suites Orlando at Seaworld", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34515-d1391738-Reviews-Fairfield_Inn_Suites_Orlando_at_Seaworld-Orlando_Florida.html", "Price": "$112 - $170*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">10815 International Drive</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Orlando</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">32821</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1391738", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/22/ea/dd/fairfield-inn-suites.jpg"}}
