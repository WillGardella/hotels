We didn't use the hotel restaurant as we prefer to eat out and my friend is on a strict gluten, yeast free diet.

Great selection inc. porridge (oatmeal) with unlimited toppings for $3.95. For evening meals there's loads of great places on 9th Av. We went to 'Nizza' several times as it offers a full gluten-free menu and for my friend who craves bread, free corn bread whilst waiting for your main!

What a wonderful place to stay! The hotel staff are so nice and helpful- always smiling, ready to help with directions, even saying, \"welcome back\" when you return after exploring the city. The rooms are comfortable, although small from what I'm used to in the midwest, but standard size for New York. We were given a room on the 24th floor, which put us far away from the street noise. Our view, however, was not impressive- looking out over a roof of a building and at construction across the street. The beds are SO comfortable, as are the pillows. The hotel gives bottles of water daily, as well as coffee in the room. My only complaint would have to be the size of the bathroom- more the configuration. There is no counter space, which is a problem for 2 women sharing the bathroom! The hotel is right across the street from the Port Authority bus station, which is helpful if you want to take the express bus back to Newark Airport. There are subway stations conveniently located near the hotel. The ACE line is right there, and the NQR line is on the next block. You are about 2 blocks off of Times Square.

They also have 2 computers in the lobby, offering free internet and printing (great for printing off boarding passes). I would definitely stay here again! Ask for Alex- he will help with anything!!

There was no breakfast included, which is not ususal for European hotels, but I found it perfectly fine for a NYC hotel, whilst we enjoyed our morning coffee in the lobby and it was wonderfully brewed. They also have ice machines which was very important for us as we were travelling by car. + the parking is in a walking distance, so we were perfectly satisfied with the hotel & I will for sure stay here again if in NYC again.!!", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat Little Secret in a Fab Location\u201d", "Author": "pherbert217", "ReviewID": "UR124217302", "Content": "When I was first searching for a place for a 50 and over girlfriend's getaway weekend we were looking for the lowest price. While no NYC hotel is in any way cheap, this hotel beat out the other chain hotels in price. We booked it, and I, having lived in NYC years ago was apprehensive on where it was located and the possibility that it was a run down NYC hotel. Wow, were we surprised! The location was great! While not picturesque, it was located directly across from an entrance to Port Authority bus terminal. Therefore, there were plenty of cabs in line right around the corner. We had driven in, and it was a snap to get from the Lincoln tunnel to the parking garage near the hotel. The hotel participated with the garage so the parking was only $28.00 per nite which is half the price of normal overnite parking in NYC. We could walk anywhere and like I said before, cabs were nearby. The accommodations were very nice, even a bit upscale with luxurious bedding and decor. AND, it was not one of those horrible tiny NYC rooms. Our group consisted of 4 people and we could actually walk around the beds in the room. I have been in some NYC hotels that you just open the door and throw your bag somewhere, with no walking space. Staff was nice and courteous. I would definitely stay there again.

We choose this hotel because of a special rate offer we received from our reward points. Our honeymoon was a long weekend so we were able to observe the hotel both weekday and weekend. Positives: Great Value (for the Times Square area and with our special), the higher floors (which we had) offer decent views of the city, some of the employees really go above and beyond to ensure their guest have an enjoyable stay, and by NYC standards the room is a decent size (King Beds, which is hard to come by in the city). You can open your windows and listen to the city, they have black-out shades for those who like to sleep in, and Showtime. You're blocks from most of NYC's entertainment: Broadway, Rockafeller Center, Times Square, Toys-r-us, Macy's, 5th Ave, etc. 95% of our stay was very accommodating and pleasant. Not-so-Positive: The low-point of our trip was unfortunately the ending. Having stayed there for four days, we asked the bell-hop desk to assist us in hailing a taxi a number of times. It can be very difficult obtaining a taxi, especially in Times Square during the weekend. It's almost a competitive sport for us non-natives. Most of the bellmen were helpful and accommodating except for ALEX. In hopes of making it easier for the staff, we called down from our room, requesting that a cab be hailed for us. Alex, the bellman, responded that he didn't provide this service. Puzzled, and overwhelmed with the idea of having to lug our suitcases and shopping bags along 40th street to find a cab ourselves, we went down to the lobby, hoping there was a misunderstanding. I went to the bell-stand, and Alex was there. I repeated my request and he responded that they don't flag cabs for guests. I stood there confused because every other bell-person had done this for us, so I didn't understand why this was an issue now. Surprisingly, this wasn't the depth of Alex's unprofessional tact, because as he brushed me aside and began checking the bags of other guests, he asked one of the ladies if they would need help acquiring a taxi cab or car service later in the day!!! My husband and I were floored and utterly insulted! I was not rude; we were floating down from the bliss of an amazing honeymoon - why was he treating us this way? Obviously this was selective service; so I asked for a manager. I shared our concerns with Marcus, the manager on duty, explaining that we were in a hurry to catch our train. He addressed Alex, who by this time was outside hailing a taxi. As were were being escorted to it by the manager, who was very apologetic, Alex was stomping back inside, refusing to open the taxi door or settle our luggage in the taxi for us. What a horrible send off! Definitely not indicative of the $1000+ we spent with the hotel during our stay. With unemployment being so high, it's such a shame to see individuals take their jobs for granted. Outside of that, there were only minor things: the room was a bit dusty, there was a ring around our sink, and the room service leaves much to be desired. Also, the front desk was aware of our honeymoon, and I believe they assigned us a city view room because of that (and that was beautiful), but nothing above that was offered (i.e. a congratulatory comment at check-in, complimentary champagne toast, a desert or fruit tray, not even a congrats card) However, there are hundreds of restaurants surrounding the hotel, the room service is NOT good, but it's not offensive, and 99% of the staff was amazing. Overall, it's a good place to stay, but not great. For Times Square, the rate was just about equal to the quality - but in all fairness, our experience with Alex really brought our perception about this hotel down. We probably won't opt to stay here when we visit again in the spring.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Small Rooms, Overall Good experience\u201d", "Author": "ravi_trivedi", "ReviewID": "UR121610920", "Content": "I stayed at this place in Nov, and had a overall good experience.

It is a lower, more budget-friendly hotel and that is what I was expecting. Check-in was easy: lobby is very small but efficient and we were checked in within 5 minutes. Very friendly staff and they were very helpful in getting us in comfortably and quickly. We were placed on the 23rd floor (room 2306). I think that the floor is for Starwood Preferred Members (as the sign indicated when you got off the elevator) but the room was very well appointed, much nicer than I anticipated. The location is not super ideal - just far enough from the theaters to think about it - but decent considering the hotels right in the Square were going for $600 and up for the same weekend. It was not that big of a deal being a few blocks off Times Square. We ate at the Gotham Bistro in the hotel for breakfast (check restaurant.com - they have gift certificates for the location) and the food was decent, not great. Two of the employees at the restaurant got into a little argument which caused a little bit of commotion but the staff recovered quickly and got us our order fairly efficiently.

Bathroom is extremely small with no counter space but its doable. the only downside is -----drumroll ---- we had bed bug bites :( we didnt realize it until we left. We thought we had been bit out at Central park since we were out there all day for about 4 days but we came to realize it wasnt. If they could get rid of the bed bugs i'd definitely wanna stay there again. My husband had alot and they were UGLY !! Anyhow, We were here on a budget so we loved picking up a slice of pizza from the little corner place \"3 brothers\" for like $2 ! Walked over to Dallas BBQ for lunch for about $6-7 a person and the food was delicious. It was a bit busy but still good bbq. Walked to a broadway show, caught the subway just a hop skip n jump away from our hotel. Cant beat it ! oh and last but not least went to a Yankee game !!!", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California, United States", "Title": "\u201cA pleasant surprise\u201d", "Author": "Lucky N", "ReviewID": "UR119477260", "Content": "Our company stayed at this hotel during a recent convention.

Although not large, the rooms have all the amenities you'd expect and is very well laid out. The bathroom is also small but, again, is well laid out. No towel bars in the bathroom, but the usual reminder that to save water, etc., hang your towels on the towel bar for reuse. Oh well. The exercise facility is quite nice and well-equipped. WiFi and Internet are plentiful and easily available to all guests, but \"Sheraton Link\" in the lobby area could use more computers. WiFi is free in the lobby area and in parts of the facility, but strangely costs $14.95/day when used from the guestroom. More and more hotels have free WiFi throughout their buildings and, more and more, free WiFi is becoming ubiquitous. There's even free WiFi in Times Square! Guests can upgrade their rooms and gain access to the Club/Lounge on the 44th floor for a relatively modest charge of $50/day. If you're a Starlight Preferred Platinum cardholder, I believe Club access is included. There are additional computers in the Club area. The Club also serves a modest breakfast and snacks beginning at 5:30. Food is plentiful and adequate. Soft drinks are complimentary, but there's a charge for alcohol. All in all, a great place to stay. Hotel staff are friendly and courteous - and in the lobby area they are abundant, with the possible exception of reception staff. At 7 one morning, there seemed to be only one person on duty, and there was a short backup waiting for service.

The rooms are small but it's New York so you can't expect a Vegas sized room. The beds are super comfortable and the rooms were always immaculate. The hotel is literally a five minute walk to 42nd street and the theatre district as well as Times Square. There are a few subway stations close by and a taxi rank right in front of Port Authority Bus Terminal located across the street from the hotel. Before staying here I read reviews about the seediness of street and a lack of safety from some reviewers. You will seriously have ZERO problem. I never once felt unsafe, If you feel unsafe from a few liquor stores and adult stores then you shouldn't be traveling in the first place. There is a parole office next door but I hardly even saw it open and when it was open very quiet. Checkout was once again speedy and friendly. The bellman also got us a great deal on a private car to JFK. This hotel had it all and at an extremely affordable price.

And it was the 2nd time my wife had stayed here and we will stay here again. It is a nice hotel with an excellent and very professional staff that was most helpful. Our bill was complicated as I had three rooms all in my name as we were using a combination of my Starwood points and paying for some nights, plus my Mom had one free night under her name, but in the end it all came out correctly. My wife and I stayed all four nights on Starwood points and were upgraded to a Suite on the 32nd floor. Don't know the price, but I would highly recommend this upgrade as both rooms of the suite were very roomy, clean, modern and gave a wonderful view. The other two rooms were regular rooms and the other guests staying with us commented that they liked their rooms and that the beds were comfortable - on the nights they paid for I think it was $220 per night plus taxes. When we first checked in the air conditioner in the living room would not turn on and so I called and they had maintenance up there to fix it within minutes - turned out it was just locked. I asked for a refrigerator for my room and also got that within minutes. The bed was comforable and the entire hotel wasvery clean. The only area I would suggest to the hotel where they could improve, from my experience, was the restaurant where we ate breakfast four mornings in a row. The food was great, but at times the service was very slow, even when there were few people dining. One tip I would give is to book early, and if you can, take advantage or the Pre-Pay prices to get a lower price. We booked the regular rates in Feb or March I think for $220 at the standard rate. We called back in late June to pre-pay, but by then the price had risen to the \"summer rates\" and the pre-pay rate in June was higher than the standard rate in March. Always pays to plan ahead as you can cancel with not charge up to 48 hours before arrival for standard rates. Pre-Pay is non refundable but saves you money if you are 100% sure about your plans.

Also, the beds were kind of extra soft and mushy and the concierge gave us some erroneous information which created an inconvenience but not a major problem.

We had done a lot of research before booking this hotel. All NY hotels in this location are expensive. This hotel seemed to offer the best balance between quality and price. We were expecting something clean and comfortable and being New York, a very small room. However the room was spacious, very clean, extremely comfortable and with a view of the top of the empire state building. The huge bed was very inviting and difficult to get out of in the morning! Some previous reviews have mentioned problems with heating. We had none. It was always warm and you could adjust the temp if needed. The staff were always helpful and helped us with a few questions about wifi etc. We did not eat at the hotel so I can't comment on the food. We rarely drank in the small hotel bar as staff here were very unfriendly and the drinks very overpriced. The only downsides we experienced were the bar as mentioned and not being able to get wifi in our room. We had to stand in the hallway to get a signal. Also we needed 2 accesses to wifi and only one person could use the password at a time. However we asked and they gave my husband a second password. So we were happy with that. The free wifi was one of the things that made us go with fourpoints. So we were a little annoyed not to be able to use it on our stay. The up sides are listed below: Great location Friendly staff Very comfy bed very clean Starbucks filter coffee in room and replaced daily Free bottled water daily other things we thought you might find useful for your stay here. Make sure you have a slice of pizza from 2 bros pizza on the corner of the street if you go left out of the hotel. It is literally a minutes walk. Head left out of the hotel and at the end of the street turn right. Head up 9th avenue for loads of choice of restaurants just a 10 minute walk away. This is called hell's kitchen but don't be put off. We had the friendliest service here. And the nicest food. We highly recommend 5 napkin burgers and daltons bar and grill. You will also find restaurant row up here. We tried many bars on 9th and the streets between 8th and 9th and did not find any that we were not comfortable in. We also ate and drank in most of the heartland breweries around manhattan. Highly recommend the appetizers here for a snack with your drinks. The sweet potato fries had us hooked! Other (hopefully) helpful tips for your stay in NY. Don't go to planet Hollywood for brekkie. It's cold, overpriced, unfriedly. Just don't. Instead go to applebees. They're everywhere. Great food and friendly service. When (not if!) you go up the empire state building don't bother paying the extra for the top floor observation deck. The view from the lower floor (I can't remember the number) is better as there is no dirty glass in the way. The top observation deck is also crowded and uncomfortable. Aim to go before sunset so you can get day and night views in the space of half an hour. We highly recommend the grayline bus tours. You can buy tickets from the grayline reps in bright red jackets that can be found all over the place. We got a 48 hour all loops tours. The tour guides are good and informative. You'll pick up all sorts of tips and gems of knowledge and it gives you a great idea of what you want to see while in New York. Use the subway but get a good subway map first as it can be confusing. Take a trip to lower east side. It's more relaxed and cheaper. Walk over the Brooklyn bridge fir a view of the manhattan skyline. Take the staten island ferry for great views of the statue of liberty. It's free!! Take plenty of money with you.

To the west of Times Sq (where the hotel is located) the neighborhoods are a little mixed, and yes the hotel shares a street with some Adult DVD stores (with tastefully whited out windows of course!) and the Parole Office, however at no point did I feel unsafe, there was so much foot traffic around and everywhere was well lit. The hotel is next to the Fairfield Inn - which has the Sky Room on the 33rd floor which I would recommend. Nice bar with cool views - think it would be awesome in the summer when you could sit outside. Overall for the price we paid (got 50% off our second night via a Starwood offer) felt we got good value for money, and it was great to be able to walk everywhere and be so close to the action.", "Date": "December 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cRooms and Service were excellent\u201d", "Author": "rrlawgirl", "ReviewID": "UR88758304", "Content": "This hotel far exceeded my expectations.

My two major complaints are that there was graffiti on the walls in the bathroom and bedroom (B!@%$) was scrawled on the walls in pencil (or pen) in at LEAST 7-8 different locations. The walls had a textured wallpaper on them so it was hard to see until it was daylight and we didn't notice it right away, so didn't inform the front desk until the next morning - their response? - \"well, you never said anything last night\" - my response - \"We were tired and excited to be here, and didn't spend much time in there yesterday, that doesn't change the fact that there is graffiti on the walls! I would appreciate it if you would have someone look after cleaning it up.\" The girl behind the desk was obviously not happy with my response to her accusatory tone, which was noticed by another employee who promptly took over dealing with me. We left the hotel for the day and the graffiti had been cleaned up upon our return. However, that night, my daughter called me into the bathroom after she finished her shower to show me what appeared to be small flecks of blood splattered on the wall behind the bathroom door (I'll let you speculate about how it got there, I certainly have my own idea) Needless to say we were grossed right out, and made the decision to just keep the bathroom door open for the duration of our stay as the stains seemed to be localized to just those spots on the wallpaper behind the bathroom door, and everywhere else was spotless. I can honestly say that otherwise our stay was nice, and the room and bed were too, but I will spend more money next time to avoid such unpleasant issues, and hopefully receive better customer service. I would not recommend this hotel to people traveling with children ( my daughter is 14, so the word written on the wall was not unheard of to her, but this would have been VERY uncomfortable with younger children), and would suggest REALLY checking the room before unpacking.

The other thing related to the rate, is that NY hotels just fill up. It's that kinda city. At the last minute, I invited a friend, as he had nowhere to stay. At check-in, I asked for twin beds - all sold out. Decide your room preference early, is the message. Another NYC thing is the small hotel rooms. This is not the smallest I have stayed in, but it was close. Nothing bad about it, just was a (small) issue, as I had my friend. Fortunately, he didn't have much luggage, as my suitcase took up some space. Did my friend sleep on the couch? There's no couch!

No bellman came out to the cab to assist with luggage upon arrival, but this was fine as I feel no need to pay someone to handle one bag. The lobby of the hotel is small but tasteful and check-in was quick and pleasant. My room was on the fourth floor, facing 40th Street and the Port Authority, and was fairly spacious by New York standards. It was very clean and all appointments were in good repair. The A/C was easy to operate and effective (although it had a tendency to rattle and I was unable to find the source of the noise). The king bed was extremely comfortable and the pillows/linens were of high quality. The room also included a fairly large flat-screen HDTV, a nice desk area, an armoire, an electronic safe, a coffee maker, and an armchair. The bathroom was sleek and modern with a spacious, glass-doored, walk-in shower (no tub, if that matters). Mirror lighting was relatively good by hotel standards. The sink was stylish and functional but offered very little counter space for toiletries. There is a small onsite restaurant that offers a few tables in a glass-roofed, atrium-style space, which was quite pleasant in the morning. I had booked a AAA offer that included a complementary breakfast served there, and the menu price for this meal would've been just under $20. The food was good and the service pleasant enough. Just outside the restaurant is a guest computer terminal and printer, which allowed me to check-in with my airline online and print out my boarding pass. Use of this equipment was complementary. The hotel is located about mid-block between 8th and 9th Avenues. While not the most attractive block in Manhattan, it was a very quick walk to the theater on 44th Street and therefore ideal for my purposes. This street can be somewhat noisy, but that's true of most of the busier areas of the city, and I travel with a white noise machine that allowed me to sleep without any major disturbances. I asked for a cab at check-out and the front desk summoned a doorman who took my one bag and walked me outside to a waiting towncar just a few steps down the block. I asked if this was a cab and the doorman said yes, but it clearly wasn't - New York taxis are not towncars and are never this clean and pleasant. Also unlike taxis, this vehicle was not metered and charged a flat rate of $45 to LaGuardia.

The room was always clean although sometimes the coffees were not replaced which was annoying, though to be fair you could pick some up from the lobby.

Not nearly as nice - or expensive - as a Sheraton or a Westin but decent accommodations overall. As some other reviewers have commented, the location - across from a bus terminal, next to a building that is occupied by parolees and on the same block as sex shops - leaves somewhat to be desired. I booked my room through Starwood Preferred Guest, using my SPG points, so value-wise at 10,000 points, I would certainly have expected more. But, then, we are talking about New York City. As fate would have it, our younger daughter felt sick as we got off the train from New Jersey. We got to the hotel just after noon and were told by the woman at the front desk that the rooms were not ready and that we could not check in until the official check-in time of 3:00 p.m. That's hotel policy and I quite understand it. However, we were under unusual circumstances and needed to get our daughter to bed. After waiting for several minutes in the miniscule lobby, I asked to speak with the general manager. I got the front desk manager and explained the situation to him. He promised to check around for a room and 10 minutes later, we were on our way up the elevator to our room. I might have expected the front desk woman to consult with her manager when I told her we had a sick daughter. The hotel is tall but each floor only has 8 rooms. Our room faced the back of a building and in retrospect - notwithstanding the lack of a good view - it was a good location in that we could not hear any road traffic. The beds were comfortable and the airconditioning worked well. The room and bathroom were clean and smelled fresh. After all, it is a newer hotel. As indicated at the outset, the location is not for everyone, particularly those faint at heart, as one is very likely to encounter what one might consider as \"undesirables\" as one walks towards Times Square. It did not bother me as I am used to New York City and its \"surface dirt.\" In short, things are always better than what they appear.

There is a porno shop a few doors down from the hotel, and this appears to be the centralized location for the prostitutes.

The valance sheets in both our rooms were filthy. The furniture in the room shabby. We found popcorn and blueberries on the floor in our room. There were hairs on the towels. On the wall behind the door there was a large mud (?) stain. In one of our rooms the toilet would not flush properly. There were no glasses in both rooms. Tea and Coffee were not replenished at all in both rooms during our stay. On our first morning going to breakfast, there was broken glass in the elevator! Not a great start to our holiday! The vouchers were were given for breakfast meant that we could not choose an item cheaper than than the stated voucher. So we ended up paying $22 for orange juice one morning. Other mornings we bought other breakfast items that were half the price of the voucher. Didn't make sense to me! The staff in the breakfast room were lovely and professional.

I wish they would have an ice machine on each floor. You have to go down to the cellar to get ice. I knew that there was no bath tub or fridge so I brought a blow up kiddie pool to put our drinks in. : ) We had to drag it down to the bottom floor then use the elevator to bring it back up.

Another hotel is going up right beside this one, but construction noise was kept to a minimum. There were some worries about the \"clientele\" around the area, but we experienced no problems at all, coming or going in the evening or morning. It is obvious that this area is undergoing a dramatic transformation from run down and a bit on the sleazy side, to a more upscale and touristy area. Don't sweat the small stuff, another year or so, and this will become a very preferred location. The hotel was friendly and accomodating. We ended up with a \"one bedroom\" suite on one of the top floors that had a great view and that was very comfortable. While it had a few cosmetic flaws...nothing that caused any grief. It would have been nice to have a shower with bathtub (for after the run) and not just a shower, but the bathroom was functional enough.The business center consisted of only a desk with one computer and printer, but it worked fine when we needed it. A few issues with the HVAC...would run on for awhile. Not sure about WiFi as we didn't have any computer with us. The hotel has a small reception area, small restaurant, along with a small bar area also on the main floor, and they were working on a new restaurant on the top floor that was to open soon. Can't comment on the food, as we ate elsewhere in our travels.

It was comparable in price to the neighborhood eateries and was surprisingly good. We would probably have gone out to eat but it was 9 PM and about 10 degrees.

Starwood Gold member and used points for two nights at this hotel. Rate I found on line was $315 per night which I felt was high for a Four Points property.

Room availability at that hour is always a coin toss but they typically willl check you in when you are part of their \"program.\" In this case hotel was completely sold out the night before. Seeing I was in a jam, the front desk clerk offered me a key to a room that had been vacated but not yet cleaned so I could change into a suit for me meeting. The clerk that came on shortly after, asked for my cell # and called me by 9:20 a.m. with a clean room ready for my use. I've been to 5 star hotels that do not offer that kind of service. Bellman and conierge were also helpful, friendly and cordial each time I encountered them. I cannot say enough about the staff at this hotel. Location - I had 25th floor at the back of the hotel facing the Westin at 51st and 8th. Noise was absolutely zero. I'm a little confused about the noise complaints from buses in and out of the port authority. There is some traffic in front of the hotel but I saw few buses and anything was rarely moving fast enough to make any noise due to proximity to traffic light and traffic. Perhaps it is louder on lower floors and/or facing another direction. I'm not sure what people expect in NY but there is nothing unsafe about this location. There is one or two adult bookstores on the block but never did I encounter anyone loitering and feel uncomfortable at any of the day or late night. Well located to attractions, dining, subway and Times Square. Best to walk 1/2 block to 8th or 9th to get a cab. They were not easy to find in front of the hotel. FInally, this place is great if you are traveling in or out of Newark airport. Very close to the tunnel and you can get a one way charter bus on Coach USA for $15. Door to door in under 40 minutes. Rooms - nice decor with minimalist approach to decorating. Beds were very comfortable and clean. Flat screen tv, clock radio with mp3 connection, plenty of outlets to plug things in. Bathroom lacks counter space as do most in Manhattan. Strangest thing to me was having the turn water pressure all of the way on to get hot water. The flat bottom sink would splash everywhere so use caution if you are fully dressed. Great glass shower with good pressure and lots of space. In room safe, iron and ironing board all in good working order. Two free bottles of water per day and wired/wireless internet included throughout the hotel. Yes - the room is small as most are in NYC. If you sit at the desk across from the bed, another person cannot pass behind you. You just dont get square footage in the city so I dont factor this as a negative. Hotel - did not use the gym. Lounge is small counter up front for breakfast and drinks in the evening with a tv for sports or news. Did not order room service or use small restaurant on premise so I cannot speak to food.

The closest available hotel was the Four Points Midtown. I read the reviews and was a little concerned about the neighborhood, but figured it was only two nights and you are basically just there to sleep, right? I believe this hotel went through a renovation not long ago, so the outside and lobby look new. The lobby is small with a small concierge desk, check-in desk and a tiny bar/coffee lounge to the right. Check in was pretty quick and we headed up to room 903.... The room was simply remodeled, but you could tell that it was an old, remodeled room, if that makes sense. It's small...there isn't room for two people to walk between the end of the bed and the deks at the same time. We had a king bed (which I must say was VERY comfortable, along with the pillows and linens - by far the best feature in the room!) with two nightstands; an armoire to hang your clothes and housed the safe, iron and ironing board and coffee maker; a desk with chair, a flat panel TV and a side chair and lamp. The bath was very small and plain, but did the job. Not fancy. but clean and like I said, the bed was fantastic! At this point I was pretty happy with the hotel, and we went out exploring... SO - onto the 'hood - don't let the reviews saying that it's a seedy neighborhood and that it's unsafe scare you....it's really not that bad! Directly across the street is the Port Authority with buses coming in and out most hours of the day - so expect noise. Quite a lot of it actually. Yes, and just a few steps out the door of the hotel and to the right is a Parole Office but I honestly never saw anyone hanging around there. Nor did I see any shady looking characters hanging around the Adult DVD stores. Just keep walking by and you'll be fine... It's about a 5-10 minute walk to Times Square, depending if you hit stoplights or not (and how fast you walk!) There are tons of convenience stores, restaurants (fast food and sit-down) and a Starbucks on the way. We didn't have any issues with the air conditioning/fan, our water temperature or pressure - or anything else funky for that matter. So far so good, right?...until we went to bed. Oh Lord! It was so loud that I kept getting up to check to make sure the window wasn't open! I am somewhat of a light sleeper, but typically when I'm traveling and I walk many, many miles in a day, I crash pretty hard. But it didn't matter how tired I was, I absolutely couldn't get to sleep because of the noise - mostly coming from the Port Authority across the street. Luckily I remembered I had some ear plugs so I popped those in and managed to get about 5 hours of sleep. Now, I have to say that my boyfriend is a very heavy sleeper and could fall asleep on a tarp in the middle of a construction site, so he didn't have any problems. Perhaps the noise wouldn't be as bad on a higher floor? My suggestion would be to avoid the street side on the 9th floor - unless you sleep like my boyfriend! Or have ear plugs. With that....Overall, even with the noise, I think this hotel is a good value for it's location. Feel free to contact me with any questions... Happy Travels!

The hotel is less than three months old, which makes it one of the newer and cleaner hotels in NYC. Rooms: The brand new rooms were a reasonable size for two adults and immaculately clean, especially the all-white bathrooms which seemed to sparkle when the lights were on. The bed was top notch, and the desk was actually designed for life in this century . . . meaning the TV was mounted on the wall and there were more power outlets built into the desk than I had plugs for. The desk even had built in USB connections! Location: The location is flawless if you are a leisurely tourist (right next to Times Sq and abundant subway lines and cabs), though some of the adult shops and grungy street characters on the block may turn off suburban visitors who haven't experienced much of NYC. Overall, a great 'base' to for your sightseeing or nightlife excursions. Service: For a select service hotel, not bad at all. I called down for extra Seattle's Best coffee (yum), bottled water (free), and toothpaste on separate occasions and they were all brought up within ten minutes or so. The housekeepers were friendly and did a great job making the room comfortable after returning from a long day of walking. While some of the staff seemed new, what do you expect? It's a brand new hotel! Cleanliness: Like I said, brand new hotel. It doesn't get any cleaner than this in NYC. I just hope a year from now the cleanliness doesn't start to slide. Value: After reading the above sections on my experience, what would you say the value was for a $115 rate? :-) I know it was an intro rate, but the experience I had was worth well more than $115 . . . maybe in the upper $100's I'd say, or lower $200's during peak dates. Other comments: The lobby area was a bit crammed. There is a circular seating area which takes up half of the lobby space and creates an obstructing wall in the lobby. At times it got claustrophobic with all the tourists and their luggage, but the reception desk agents did a good job greeting guests and checking them in efficiently.", "Date": "September 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "michigan", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Place for an AWESOME Price!\u201d", "Author": "tramtro", "ReviewID": "UR41166158", "Content": "We also got in on the opening rate through travelzoo for 115.00.

In fact, NYC felt very safe throughout; police officers were everywhere, including one or two on the corner of 40th St. and 8th Ave., near the hotel, almost everytime we walked by. On the other side, 9th Ave. had many good restaurants. We also found advantages to being close to the Port Authority. Inside are good places for breakfast and coffee, below is a subway station, and outside were taxis all the time. In other words, we were able to get a good coffee and pastry in the morning and then travel to anywhere in the city we wanted. We also liked the fact that we could easily walk to the theatre district. We saw two major plays on 45th St., just five to ten minutes away. Second, the service was hit and miss. A few employees were very helpful, and a few didn't seem too responsive to requests. One thing that especially bothered us was when we wanted our sheets changed the first night (because of strange hairs in the bed), they only changed the top sheet. This happened twice. We finally got the sheets and changed the thing ourselves. Besides that, the bed was very, very comfortable. I must also give the hotel credit for storing our baggage for free on the day we checked out. This allowed us to see more of the city before our night flight.

I was very concerned about the location especially with some of the reviews I read regarding the hotel's location since you must pass a couple of adult bookstores and a parole department. However, the location was fine. There were no scary people loitering about I hardly noticed the parole department. There was a cop usually on the corner of the street which is not unusual since there are all over the times square area. We just walked quickly to the hotel and even if we hadn't I don't think it would have been scary at all. No one bothered us at all. I don't think this is an issue at all and would not be concerned about recommending the hotel. Now, regarding the hotel itself, the beds were the most comfortable I have every slept in. The rooms were clean and I felt like for New York the rooms were a good size. We weren't tripping over lugagge. The only thing I felt misled on was the fact that the hotel says they give free bottled water. In actuality, they only provide ONE small 16 oz. bottle per day. I didn't expect them to provide a bottle each day for the four of us in the room, but one bottle seemed stingy and misleading from what they advertise. I think two bottles a day would make a better impression. If two people stayed in the room for example, couldn't they cough up enough water for at least the two of them to have their own bottle? If they don't want to do this they shouldn't advertise that the room comes with free bottled water. It seems like a deliberate ploy. Overall, if you get a good price, I would recommend this hotel. TIP: If you buy tickets from the TKTS booth, count the money in your hand BEFORE you give it to the person behind the counter. The TKTS clerk stole money from me because I was counting it out as I slid it through the window. MISTAKE!!!! Don't take your eyes off them for a moment when you hand them money.", "Date": "August 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Service": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery clean but area surrounding the hotel is a bit shady\u201d", "Author": "sds", "ReviewID": "UR37237246", "Content": "Although we had trouble with our reservation at first, all was taken care of by a very nice gentleman at the front desk.

The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was bigger than others we have seen in NYC. We had a very nice view from our room. The area in and around the hotel was a bit \"shady\" after dark, however, we did not feel too uncomfortable walking around. Still, it needs a clean up!!

I have only stayed on the Upper West Side before, and took the chance with the Times Square locale with the fantastic deal they were offering ($115/night - - check the hotel's actual website.) Although this area is definitely more \"gritty\" than the Upper West Side, the Times Square subway station gives you access to many lines that go all over the city. The room was very well appointed, and I never slept in a more comfortable bed - no kidding. There is a close subway station and a pharmacy/grocery right on the corner down the street to purchase snacks/maps, etc. The bus terminal was also right there, and we saw a few homeless types, but the patrolmen politely asked them to move on, which they did. The terminal, by the way, has a ton of low cost restaurants and snack shops also. It's also good to know a portion of Times Square is closed off on Sat. nights so pedestrians can fully take in the magnificence of it all. If you want to be close to Times Square and Broadway, this is a fantastic deal you shouldn't miss.", "Date": "August 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cgood access to subway and times square, brand new hotel, location so so\u201d", "Author": "Grogieur Eoguerwo", "ReviewID": "UR37196770", "Content": "also got the grand opening special of 115 dollars with taxes 135 just off times square - only had problems once with riff raff brand spanking new only 8 rooms per floor my room looked great bigger than i thought i would get for new york really not much smaller than a hilton i stayed in in New jersey desk with hookup/cable for laptop. don't even need to use the Wi fi great value but if i had more money i'd stay away from Times Square i think....i think i'd like more downtown 40th street has access to the Times square subway - like there is a subway entrance half a block from the hotel........A C E lines on the other side of 40th st is the bus terminal there was also 2 computers for public use. 1 had a working printer so i could print my boarding pass small fitness centre. didn't use it . didn't see anyone in it staff: room made up nicely the front desk staff have google.......when they don't know they can look it up i thought they tried hard when i had a concern", "Date": "August 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Location": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "CT", "Title": "\u201cBeware of Booking online\u201d", "Author": "m_and_mCt", "ReviewID": "UR37157603", "Content": "We booked the hotel last minute (the night before our arrival) through booking.com.

When we produced the booking confirmation the staff changed their story and told us that they had tried to call us that morning (we had no way of confirming this as we had been travelling to the hotel!).
