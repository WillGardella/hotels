It is located rue Mermoz, nearby the Champs Elysees, and although on the opposite side of the Rond-Point from avenue Montaigne, this street is nowhere near to offer the same hype, but is relatively quiet. Rooms, while not very large, are spacious enough, clean, relatively well decorated and well equipped with flat screen TV, iPod docking station etc. Bathrooms are minuscule, but also clean and there is on the other hand a separate toilet which is much appreciated. Reception staff are always welcoming and friendly. My main complaint about this hotel concerns their pricing policy and commercial practices. While I had previously staid here last year for slightly over 200 Euros a night, they charged me this time 285 Euros for an equivalent room\u2026 and this was supposedly a \u201cspecial offer\u201d with no cancellation opportunity. As the room was booked by my secretary I paid no attention to this, until I realized that my credit card had already been debited by the amount of my reservation 2 days after the booking was done \u2013 that is, one month prior to my stay! Management may certainly argue I should have read the fine print, but it remains that (i) debiting the CC in advance is an unusual practice and I definitely didn\u2019t like it and (ii) 285 Euros for a so-called \u201cspecial offer\u201d in this hotel is way overpriced.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff", "Title": "\u201cStylish rooms, friendly service\u201d", "Author": "TonyMCardiff", "ReviewID": "UR122730971", "Content": "We spent 4 nights at this hotel.

After just spending 2 nights at the Elysees Mermoz (we left today!), I just had to share my GREAT experience. Selecting a hotel in Paris is not easy, there are so many choices and we took a chance on booking at a small boutique type hotel, like this. We are usual ones that stick to major chains, Hyatt, Four Seasons, etc... you get the point. I can't say how wonderful the experience was. The hotel is small, smaller rooms, but a very wonderful and comfortable stay. They have wonderful amenities in the bathroom (ladies, you know what I mean) and the rooms are modern and SO CLEAN. I'm quite picky with cleanliness and can find something wrong with any room, this room was spotless. They offer a continental breakfast that they will deliver to your room which is delicious and they don't skimp on the bakery basket! I tried room service dinner and didn't notice any hot dishes, which some people might not like, but other than that, this was by far one of the best experiences I've had with a hotel. Also to mention, there is a super friend girl that works at the front desk (not sure her name, she had beautiful long dark hair) who is so friendly and willing to help at any time. For the price paid, the service was beyond exceptional. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL. It's also super close to Champs Elysees!

We always want to ensure we have a nice clean bathroom and this hotel met our expectations in this area. The staff were curteous and always willing to help. They even gave us free stamps and showed us the nearest post box for post cards we were sending back home. They even helped us book cabs without an extra charge and calling our day tour companies and speaking in french to confirm meetinig points etc. Booked through hotels.com and recieved a rate far cheaper then what the hotel was offering at that time, so shop around.

When I went to check-in, I was given the key to room 100 and told that the room was right next to the entrance. You literally pass the room to get from the entrance of the hotel to the reception area. My first concern as a solo, female traveler was about safety. Yes, the hotel is in a big area, but Paris is like any metropolitan city in the world and crime happens. I felt uncomfortable being in a room that was pretty much on top of the street and so easily accessible by anyone who walked in to the hotel. I was also concerned about the noise as I had a 7:30am flight to catch the following morning. I asked the receptionist if there were any other rooms available due to the noise concern and she said that they were fully booked, yet assured me that it was a \"very, very quiet room.\" This was a blatant lie. I went to take a nap before a dinner party. Within 5 minutes, someone came into the hotel. From the bed I could hear the glass doors sliding to open in close. I could also hear every word of the conversation that transpired between the receptionist and the other hotel guest. I went out of the room once their conversation had ended and requested to speak to the manager. I was then informed that the manager was not there and that the receptionist was the only person available. I asked again if there was anybody else with whom I could speak about the issue. The receptionist then told me that they didn't even have any housekeeping staff (Paris in August...). But seriously, no staff when your hotel is fully booked? I told the receptionist I was leaving and to cancel the reservation. She at least recommended another hotel to me (although I didn't find it so I'm not so sure about that...). I happened to be wandering for about 5 minutes before stumbling upon the newly re-opened Beaucamp hotel and had a fantastic experience for the same price.

There was a good room service menu but we didn't use it so don't know what the food was like (I didn't see a restaurant so maybe its ordered from one of the restaurants in the street?). Breakfast was simple but good - friendly lady helped with boiling eggs etc! In fact everyone who worked at the hotel was friendly! There are several restaurants in the street that looked nice - AVOID the resaturant pasta pa pa (or pizza pa pa?) which is at the end of the street on the other side of the road to the hotel - it is one of a chain of pasta and pizza restaurants in Paris - it was very unfriendly and the food was not good! The other Italian (Pasta Basta?) on the same side of the road as the hotel was great for a quick lunch - its tiny and you can either eat in or take away. We paid 250 euros for a midweek night and 216 euro for the friday night - this included breakfast for all of us - it was a special offer only bookable through the website.

Staff efficient and very pleasant and no trouble to leave our bags there for most of the day after we had checked out as our Eurostar booking wasnt until 6pm.

We never ate at the Hotel with so many Patisseries near. The Champs is 5 minutes by foot. The Metro is equally close. This Hotel is a very good value with reasonably sized rooms, nice bathrooms.
