Were only two blocks from the Sacre Couer. I highly recommend spending the 6 euros to walk up to the Dome. That is, if you do not mind climbing 10 flights of stairs. The view of Paris was phenominal. Montremart is a great location in the city with lots of bistros nearby. Place near the Sacre Couer and the artist square was great. Staff was friendly and accomodating.

We arrived by Eurostar at Gare du Nord, and since the taxi line was huge, we walked about 10-15 min to get here. Going back to Gare du Nord for the RER airport train, we took the Anvers metro (some stairs) back, with a bit of a walk from the connecting La Chapelle station. Convenient to 2 metro line stations (anvers and Abesses) about 5 min walks away. Plenty of restaurants in the neighborhood (do try the Pizza place just south of Blvd Rouchechart nr the Carrefour grocery store 1 -2 blocks west of here). Usually one transfer required to get to the main sites in Paris by metro. Never felt unsafe at night, neighborhood a little rougher than the rest of Paris (esp Barbes-Rouchechart metro station), which was my greatest fear, but we typically got back btwn 8-9 pm at night and never had a problem. Arrival: Staff very pleasant, on arrival and departure. Room: Clean modern design, great for a family with young kids. We went to the Carrefour about a block away to get items for breakfast. The hotel offering was a little too pricey for me (10 euros for some croissants, coffee, etc). We had a room overlooking the courtyard with a balcony which was very nice (called a studio for 4 persons). Beds were made out of sofa beds (4 individuals). In room safe (which we could not get to work), and also a safety box at the reception area. Only problem was the lack of air conditioning, the room can get a little stuffy with the windows closed. Do bring salt and pepper and sugar, but all pots/pans and utensils provided. On friday/sat night, could hear music from a nearby club, which was the only drawback of the location. One night people were laughing and living it up at the courtyard or nearby restaurant as well. No traffic noise, however. Amenities: Nice little garden in the courtyard. Overall, very pleasant stay. Just beware of the noise on weekend nights if you are a light sleeper.

I would stay here again for a short break - but probably not for a whole week.", "Date": "November 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holland", "Title": "\u201cNot some where I would stay or recommend.\u201d", "Author": "unhappyjan", "ReviewID": "UR6046966", "Content": "We booked our accommodation through a travel agent and they informed us on booking that we had booked one of the biggest rooms that they offer. We are a family of 5, children aged 12, 10 & 6. We had an appartment that slept 6. On our arrival we were very impressed with the look of the hotel in and out side, very modern. After booking in went to our room on the second floor. Upon opening the door a stale musty smell came from our appartment. The rooms were very small, so small that when standing in the kids bunk room you were able to have one shoulder touching the bunk bed and the other touching the wall. You basically had to step into the bath to close the bathroom door. The kitchen was roomy but no bench space, no kettle to boil water, no toaster, no washing liquid, no cloth to wipe down table. With having 5 people in a 6 bed appartment I would have expected that we all had beds, except our 12 year old had to sleep on a rollaway on the floor in the lounge room. Overall the service from the reception was rude and not acceptable. No one every around to get any information. We would not recommend these appartments to anyone who has a family. It is very central to everything and has a shuttle bus that pulls up the front to take you to Euro Disney. This is good value.", "Date": "November 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed our studio with kitchen in Monmartre\u201d", "Author": "A swedish family", "ReviewID": "UR5325620", "Content": "Stayed with the family at this place and were satisfied that it gave us what was described on the internet. The studio was clean and no bugs to be found not even in the waste room in the corridor, which was kept very clean. One has to remember that you have a nicely equipped kitchen (saves a lot of money for a family) in the studio. There is a nice grocery store close to the residendence the chain is called Champion and have everything you need. Buy your breakfast there and your bread at the bakery close to the place. The Metro station Anvers is a few minutes away from the place it will take you to the Eiffel tower in about 15 minutes not counting the transfer. The studio was facing the street with a lower Paris noise than I have experienced in hotels in the center with its large boulevards and heavy traffic round the clock. If you close the window you will be OK until the waste truck comes along the street. If you want a quite room you should book an apartment facing the lovely inner garden (but then you miss out on spying on the Parisian life outside) The staff helped us in all our questions and we had nothing negative to say about them. In short we enjoyed our little parisian apartement and its location and would recommend it to others, especially as Paris hotels can be very noisy. Finally we saw nothing of the sex industri people mention when talking about Montmartre (Clichy). The area have a lot of nice resturants and shops close so you will enjoy an evening stroll with the children to the Sacre Couer a few minutes (and stairs) away.", "Date": "June 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buenos aires", "Title": "\u201cMmmmmm\u201d", "Author": "PatricitaPepa", "ReviewID": "UR4933523", "Content": "Beware this is not a hotel, this is a time-share appt. you dont get ANY service, no cleaning, no changing towels, nothing but a french reception lady, very selfish and absolutely helpless.

Fortunately our fears were unfounded. We booked a 2-bed studio for 3 nights, and found it very good value for money. The studio was clean, 2 beds, with a nice bathroom (toilet separate) and a reasonably well equipped kitchenette (fridge, coffee-maker, mini-oven, stove, pots, crockery for 4). Our windows opened on the Rue D\u2019Orsel, a typical small Parisian cobbled (one-way) street, literally a stone throw away from the bottom of the Sacre-Coeur gardens. Unfortunately we had no grand view over the Sacre-Coeur, since we were on the second floor, but had intimate observation of the daily ebb- and flow of life on the street! We spend many a peaceful moment with a glass of wine spying on the neighborhood from our window. At night you could hear a car coming down the street for a mile, but by closing the double glazed windows, the noise is shut out effectively. The hotel is situated in the heart of the Montmarte area, with lots of small restaurants and interesting little shops on your doorstep. The nearest big supermarket is 1.5 blocks away on the busy Boulevard De Rochechouart, direction Pigalle. Various banks and ATMs are found 2 block to the south (Rue Lallier). The nearest Metro is the Anvers Metro Station, 1.5 blocks to the east. The Boulevard De Rochechouart is your gateway to the rest of Paris via the Open-top tourist busses, with a terminal (Sacre-Coeur) 1 block away from the hotel. This part of the Montmarte escapes the seedy sex-shops and characters found in the Pigalle area, 3 blocks further west. We did not try the optional breakfast offered by the hotel, but prepared most of our meals in the kitchenette. The small courtyard garden was really green and tranquil, perfect to have a morning coffee while planning the day\u2019s activities. The staff were friendly and helpful, speaking enough English to be understood. The lifts were very small, but functional. On the downside: Nothing to report, but do not expect a 5-star hotel! If the typical Paris street noise bothers you at night, ask for a unit on the courtyard-side of the hotel. We would definitely return to the Pierre & Vacances Residence when we visit Paris again, because of the good value for money, and the excellent central position in Montmarte.", "Date": "September 20, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Adagio Paris Montmartre", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d197570-Reviews-Adagio_Paris_Montmartre-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$149 - $273*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">10 Place Charles Dullin</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75018</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "197570", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b3/a4/b3a4967ec1878d47f8f0807bf26751109large.jpg"}}
