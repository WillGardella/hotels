Upon our arrival I felt a little underwhelmed by the location, but my attitude improved the longer we stayed. Location is usually a big factor for me in choosing where to stay and the reviews I had read prior to booking the Maxwell made it seem like it was in a prime location; while the Maxwell is only a 5 minute walk to the Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP Museum, Pacific Science Center), it\u2019s not as close to the waterfront/downtown area (Pike\u2019s Place, etc.) as I would have liked. We did rent a car but it was next to impossible to find street parking near the waterfront on weekdays and the parking ramps were too costly; therefore, we ended up walking to the downtown area. The walk was a little less than 1.5 miles to downtown so not bad by any means (though, I may have been whistling another tune had it rained while we were there). Overall, the location was good but not great- knowing the price we paid I would\u2019ve expected it to be a little closer to downtown but Seattle is an expensive city so I may have expected more \u201cvalue\u201d than I got. The hotel was great and I would give it 3.5 stars if I could; the Maxwell is a better than average hotel, but not quite 4 stars considering the price tag. The room was BIGGER than most standard sized hotel rooms and I never once felt cramped. It helped that the big flatscreen was mounted to the wall as that saved a lot of space on the desk. The room had a DVD player, microwave and small refrigerator which were GREAT bonuses that I really appreciated. Most hotels nowadays do not come with a microwave or fridge so I was pleasantly surprised and relieved we didn\u2019t need to pay $2 at the vending machine for a cold soda. The complimentary bottled water and microwave popcorn the hotel provided were also a nice touch. Leave your umbrella at home, the Maxwell provides one. I actually forgot to bring ours and was cursing myself on the plane, so it was nice that it was there waiting in the closet when we arrived (even though we had beautiful weather and never needed it). A few areas the Maxwell could improve: The bathroom was large but lacked privacy. The shower did not have a curtain or door and was completely open; my showers always felt cold even when turning the knob to the hottest degree because of the openness. This would also pose a problem if you are traveling with someone besides a spouse and both were getting ready at the same time. Most hotels offer a privacy curtain/door or have the sink/mirror outside of the bathroom altogether which makes it easy for 2 people to get ready at the same time. The view. We requested a Space Needle view on a higher floor (Maxwell is only 5 stories tall). We were situated on the 2nd floor and had a view of some apartments, Thai Heaven across the street and a parking garage. Yay? We were disappointed to say the least. We arrived our first night late and hadn\u2019t eaten and that was my first priority so by the time my husband called for a different room they only had one available on the 2nd floor with a \u201cpartial Space Needle\u201d view and a Queen bed. We have a King bed at home and I wasn\u2019t particularly crazy about downgrading to a Queen for 5 nights, so we stayed put. The view was less than desirable and I think we were mainly disappointed because we had specifically asked for a room with a view. We\u2019ve never encountered unaccomodation over a simple request we\u2019ve made; most hotels will gladly oblige, especially when the majority of the population never asks to begin with. Parking. The parking garage the Maxwell has is a bit of a joke. To preface, the parking is FREE whereas it\u2019s not free at a lot of hotels (however, most hotels that charge a fee for parking are also located downtown). Their parking garage has mostly \u201ccompact\u201d stalls (more compact stalls than regular stalls) and most cars took up 2 parking spaces because they could not fit in these tiny stalls; keep in mind that the cars that were overflowing into a 2nd stall were not big by any means. We usually parked outside in the \u201c10 minute\u201d parking space as the front desk said this was acceptable. This saved us a headache most of the time. I did workout in the fitness center as did my husband. He liked it, I did not. It was really small. Luckily, there was never anyone else there and if there had been I might\u2019ve left because it was just too small of a space for multiple people to share. The elliptical machine was an older model and wasn\u2019t as nice as what I\u2019m used to but I guess that\u2019s okay for a hotel. There was a large flatscreen TV on the wall which was nice at least. Would I stay at the Maxwell again? I would. I really liked the quaint Queen Anne neighborhood, it was nice to be close to the Space Needle; Kerry Park was not far away either (a few blocks up a steep hill). I felt safe and most everything was within walking distance. On days when you just don\u2019t feel like walking several miles (or uphill!) the hotel offers a shuttle service within a 3 mile radius. The room itself was BETTER than average, but the other factors docked the rating down a bit.

When we checked in at around 2pm, our room wasn't ready yet, so they offered us a complimentary upgrade to a suite room (with a pull-out couch). Highly recommended - but I think most of these are on the 'view' side (street side) which can be noisy and disruptive if you are a light sleeper. My kids gasped with impressed awe when we opened the door. The decor was so bright and unique. What a real treat! The beds were awesome, as was the pull out couch. The TV was great, the fridge and microwave AND the Kureg coffee machine all got good use. The bathroom was clean and HUGE. It was a strange set-up (if the door is open, you can see the person sitting on the toilet - yeah, so just close the door, right?!) and there's 3 different lights in there (a main light, a shower light and a makeup light). Great Tommy Bahama shampoo, conditioner, bath gel, hand soap and lotion dispensers! Neat idea to save the bottles, but too bad you can't bring them home with you! The laminate floors were fine. Sure, a little noisier than normal, but clean. Small ironing board, but never used it. Safe and umbrella provided in the small closet. Loved the lobby and coffee/cupcake time. I drank so much coffee at this place. Ate at the Rock twice. LOVED this place. Great pizza, bear and lots of options for kids. LOVED the location. Soooo close to Seattle Center (5-10 mins to the monorail for downtown access). Close to the QFC supermarket for food to stock the fridge. Close to the I-5 and I99 for fast trips to/from the hotel. Also, FREE parking underground. LOTS of parking - I don't think you'd have a problem most times. It was wide open when we were there, but it was mid-week in spring, so I am not sure what popular weekends would be like. They also have a shuttle that takes you downtown. We used it once - and they even had a booster seat for our 6-year-old. Here's what I didn't like: - The pool was too small, but hey - at least the have one, so that's okay I guess! - No breakfast included, but hey - at least they have a little breakfast bar in the lobby that sells pastries and Starbucks in the AM. - Noisy (but that was the View side of the hotel - and the view isn't really all that great). The staff were great, the restaurant staff were AMAZING, and the facilities were really top notch. I felt safe in the area and was able to get easy access to this place (despite some construction in the area, too), so I was thrilled. Got my 3rd night free - too! Very affordable.

The hotel does not serve breakfast but there are multiple cafes within 2 min walking distance - I can recommend the Citizen and also Cafe Mekka. There are also 2 large 24/7 supermarkets very close to the hotel, where you get everything (my hotel room did have a microwave). In the same building there is a restaurant named The Rock. I was never there but it was always packed with people, which I consider a good sign. Around the corner are some nice Asian places (Thai and Vietnamese) as well as two Sushi restaurants. The hotel is nicely located in the Queen Ann district, which is a nice neighborhood as such but there are also many buses driving downtown regularly, I never had to wait for more than 2 min. The Capitol Hill district, which is home to many music bars, looks a bit far away from here, but is reachable in 10 min. by bus. A taxi from there back to the hotel at night was less than 10 bucks.

The garage was little tight to maneuver. I can\u2019t imagine parking with a big car. But we made it out with no scrapes or dents.

And at the time I am writing this it is the number one rated restaurant in Seattle. It is to die for and so close the hotel. This was a recommendation from the front desk staff and we are so glad we went. If I ever return to Seattle I would most definitely stay here again. One word of caution.

Our first time in Seattle and not realizing that being near the space needle does not mean you are near downtown. Location and getting around The staff advised us the simplest quickest way to get downtown was to walk 5 minutes to the space needle. It is definitely NOT a 5 minute walk to the monorail! We are fit people and walk at a fairly fast pace. The best time we clocked from the hotel to the monorail was 10 minutes. The monorail has two ends; space needle at one end and a shopping centre that is a couple of blocks from pike place markets. There are no other stops. Each trip is $2 for the 1 mile covered. We discovered the bus as a better option. The off peak fare is $2.25 and you should always get a transfer which lasts 2 hours so you can make the most of the ticket if you want to return to the hotel or visit another area. There are two places we picked up a bus; 5th and valley or 1st and mercer. These stops are 2 or 3 blocks away; much closer than the monorail. The room Unfortunately we were given a room right next to the elevator and with a stunning view of the car park across the road facing Roy street. As other reviewers have said it is very noisy from other rooms. You can hear everything. We had the added bonus of the dulcet tones of the bing bong of the elevator and the grand accompaniment of loud merrymakers until the wee sma's. And on a weeknight too! Then the early risers using the elevator from 5am continued to keep us alert so we wouldn't miss the continuing sounds of room doors slamming shut. We did mention to the staff each day that we were being disturbed by noise. I'm certain there was a family of elephants in the room above; running continually up and down the hallway to their door. The staff offered to contact the guests in that room if the noise continued past 10pm. We were also disturbed by passers by on the street who were often exuberant; probably due to having just been to a show at the key arena. Wifi Basically, it sucks. The only way we could get enough signal was to sit in the hallway behind out door. We advised the staff on several occasions and they blamed apple devices for the problem. Bathroom I am really not a fuss pot but I do use a hair dryer and the length of cord on their dryers is impossible to be able to dry your hair unless you are prepared to have your nose stuck against the bathroom wall. The cord must measure about a foot and a bit long. The staff could not help with that either. All the dryers were the same, I was informed. Oh well. Beds Very very comfortable.

That makes it a great deal!). We had our 20-month-old son with us, so we needed enough space to set up his playpen, which there was. We had a \"duet\" room with two queens, no view, but we didn't care (I think you pay slightly more for a view). The rooms have laminate flooring, which makes it feel cleaner than carpet, and the room was immaculately cleaned every day. Having a toddler, I'm sure we gave the cleaning staff a couple of challenges, with him getting his snacks everywhere, etc, but every day our room was spic and span. THE BEDS!!! I can't say enough about how comfortable the beds are!!! I am actually going to call the hotel to find out what kind of mattresses they were because that was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on... ever. Also, there were a billion pillows, so you could use as many as you want to get comfortable. The bathroom was a nice size, but my only complaint is that there is only a shower. Our little guy hadn't had showers yet (just baths), but since there was no tub, he had to start. He didn't care for it too much, but it got the job done. For me, the shower was great, except there was no door or curtain (the shower itself was huge, so they don't need a door since it's almost impossible to splash out into the bathroom) so it got a little drafty. For my husband, there wasn't enough water pressure (it was one of those rain-like shower heads) so I guess it just depends on what you like. The room was very nicely decorated, and the TV was beautiful! It was SO nice to have a fridge and microwave too, so we bought a few groceries at the Metropolitan Market (a few blocks away, and fantastic little store, by the way!) and ate our breakfasts and some lunches in the room, which saved us some money. The single-cup coffee maker was really handy, and they left microwave popcorn in the room, which is a nice touch! My only other comment about the room is that you could hear EVERYTHING through the door. If you are sensitive to noise, you may want to ask for a room that is far from the elevator. We were right next to the elevator so we could hear every time it beeped, and even if people were talking in hushed voices in the hall, we could hear what they were saying. The location of the hotel was perfect. A nice walk to the Space Needle and monorail station, which takes you right downtown, and we felt very safe walking around the neighbourhood with our little guy in the stroller. There were lots of amenities nearby, but it wasn't nearly as busy as being right downtown. Plus, the Seattle Center area (where the Space Needle is) is so beautiful, with lots of arts facilities and parks, fountains, amazing public space. We took the monorail downtown for $2 one way, which drops you off about 5 blocks from Pike Place Market, which was neat. The area right around the monorail stop has AMAZING shopping too! And now, my favourite part, the staff. We had never been to Seattle, so we were constantly asking them where we should go to eat, and how we should travel to the different attractions. Justin was incredibly helpful when I asked him how we should get to the Mariner's game. Our options were to take the monorail and light rail transit, which drops you off very close to the stadium, or to drive and park. I was nervous about driving downtown and knowing a safe and reasonably priced place to park, and Justin gave me precise, step-by-step directions and told me where to park for $3.50, and said that's where he usually parks when he goes to games, and he's never had issues.

Check-in was the most awkward of any hotel we've ever stayed at. Night desk guy (with thinning blonde hair) was extraordinarily awkward and unprofessional. It was next to impossible to understand anything he said because he mumbled completely unintelligibly. The fact that he spoke barely above a whisper also did not help. We got tired of asking him to repeat himself and just gave up. Beyond his complete lack of basic communication skills, he was completely incompetent--we asked him questions and he would turn to his computer for a minute or two, then turn back to us and proceed without answering our question. It was like a weird episode of the Twilight Zone. We were checked into a smaller room than booked and asked him to adjust the rate accordingly. He responded by turning and staring at his computer screen for 1-2 minutes, then turning back to us without responding. We asked him again and he responded by saying, \"there's still two of you staying in the room, so why should I adjust the rate?\". Huh?! If that's the logic, then put us in your biggest, nicest room for the same rate! The guy was so incompetent and annoying we just gave up and decided we would talk to someone the next day. Going to our room, the entire long hallway (we were at the opposite side of the hotel from the elevator) reeked of marijuana smoke (despite the hotel being non-smoking). When we got to our room we found out why--the doors have zero seal around them--there's a significant gap all the way around the door that lets in light, lots of noise and pot smoke (as even the inside of our room smelled like pot smoke). Found that our safe was broken and did not work at all. Called the front desk who assured that it would be fixed right away. When we checked out valuable at the front desk later, we reminded them again and, a second time, were reassured that the safe would be fixed. It wasn't. It took 4 requests over the course of several days to get the safe repaired. Every single time we came and went from the hotel we had to wait in line at the front desk to check our bag and wait to get our bag back. This was completely and easily avoidable and 100% unacceptable. Another disappointment was the noise--the hotel has hard laminate floors and thin walls. We could hear every step the person above us took at 6am and hear every word from the wall-mounted TV in the room next door. Poor insulation is inexcusable in a hotel in the Maxwell's price range. Especially a new hotel. Minor cons were the internet connection, decor and bath products. The internet connection was frequently unusably slow (slower than 1999 dial-up). The Maxwell tries to be hip and contemporary, but the decor/design is really just a jumble of uncohesive styles that are all over place. The bath products were pretty cheap and diluted--more like Motel 6 quality, than that of a hotel in the $200-400 range. Pros were a comfortable bed, extremely clean rooms, extraordinarily, warm, friendly and outgoing housekeeping (the front desk staff seriously needs to take hospitality lessons from the housekeeping staff, no exaggeration), a convenient Keurig coffee/tea machine and complimentary parking, water and popcorn. Overall, the Maxwell was a disappointment. After bringing a few of our concerns to the attention of the management, nothing in the way of compensation or a sincere apology was offered. It's a very clean hotel with a lot of potential, but the majority of the staff (housekeeping excluded) needs a significant education in the most elementary tenets of hotel hospitality, which is inexcusable for a hotel in Maxwell's price range.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cPerfect hotel, perfect location!\u201d", "Author": "Barbara L", "ReviewID": "UR117887074", "Content": "This was our first visit to Seattle and we will be back!

Bathrooms are sleek and modern with a huge walk-in shower (but no tub in any of the rooms I have stayed in; might be an issue if you travel with young children, or maybe they do have rooms with a tub and I've just never been assigned one). Housekeeping maintains the rooms to a high standard. One side of the hotel faces the Space Needle, so if you can get a room on that side, great! The hotel has no restaurant; there is a little nook near reception where you can buy coffee/ other drinks and pastries and perhaps a bit more, and that is open 24/7. The rooms have a refrigerator and microwave and a Keurig coffee-maker, so I just buy a muffin and fruit and yoghurt and have breakfast in my room the next morning - don't have to dress for that either! The hotel has a small pool and a fitness center, no spa that I am aware of. The neighborhood is quiet and very near everything at the Seattle Center, two blocks away. Public transportation is about 3 blocks away, and the hotel has its own parking lot if you are driving, though this is quite small and gets filled up early on. If you stay more than once, ask for the \"frequent visitor\" rate, which they call \"WOW\"; it shaves a good bit off the price of the rooms. And the hotel often runs promotions offering one free night if you stay a total of 3 or more, particularly in the winter months.

They also let us in on a great deal, as when we had booked our three night stay a few months prior, we saw the 3rd night free promotion, but it was expiring in May. Oh, well...we booked our three nights anyway. When we checked in, we were told that they had extended the 3rd night free offer, so that was super nice (they could easily have not mentioned it, or said it was for new reservations only!) . This hotel seems like it is employee-owned, because all of the staff are so genuinely helpful, friendly and accomodating---from the front desk to the housekeepers to the shuttle bus driver. That was another unexpected perk, by the way---a free shuttle that guests can use during select hours and within so many miles---very nice! We had the driver take us to the REI flagship store, which is a destination in itself---we could have walked as it turned out, but wanted to save our legs for hours of walking ahead of us. Back to The Maxwell itself----we really enjoyed being in the Queen Anne neighborhood, rather than in the heart of the tourist area downtown. It is still very convenient and close to the heart of downtown Seattle, yet is in an authentic neighborhood-----with the steep hills rising from Roy Street, it was reminiscent of San Francisco. We loved the close proximity of many good local restaurants,bars,a great grocery store up the street and it is just a good walking neighborhood as well. We felt like we could have been paying about $100 more (closer to $300) for the service, amenities, great bedding, beautiful room and good view that we were getting. We really appreciated the good coffee service in the room, and even a refrigerator, which many nicer hotels certainly don't offer you. It was great to be able to keep a few breakfast items like yogurt and juice at hand, as well as a chilled bottle of wine and some cheese! We didn't miss not having a bar or cafe in the hotel as you just have to step out the door and you can find whatever you need. (They do have a coffee bar in the lobby, as well as those delicious pineapple cupcakes and coffee in the afternoon). Thank you Maxwell Hotel for making us feel cared for and comfortable. We loved our stay with you and wished we could have stayed a week!

There isn't a bathtub but the shower is huge and I didn't miss the tub. We got a great low price on Hotwire but probably due to this, we got a room that overlooked the parking lot. I understand views are much better at the front of the hotel so it's something to request if you are so inclined. The pool was pretty small and there wasn't a hot tub as far as I could see which would have been a nice feature. The Staff here is AWESOME. I can't express enough how polite, friendly and helpful they were. I stay in a lot of hotels and this staff was the best I've seen. They were so eager to help. They all offered helpful suggestions and took extra time to explain how to get places, where their favourite restaurants are and to get us some extra coffee. We had a minor problem with our deadbolt not working and a man was sent up right away to address it. He had to come back with tools and asked when the best time would be so as not to bother us. This is more than I can say for many other hotels. The lobby has coffee available all day and little cup cakes that were very tasty. The lobby is beautiful and funky and usually very quiet and I saw people just chilling out and chatting over a bottle of wine while sitting in the comfy chairs. The location is pretty good. Lots of restaurants near by and it's about a 2 min walk to the Monorail that will take you within blocks of Pike Place Market. We went to the theatre down town and it was a 8 dollar cab ride back. The neighbourhood isn't super great for walking around, but you are right across from the Space needle so there was plenty going on over there, and as I said, you just jump on the Monorail for $2 and you're in the heart of the shopping and action. You could probably stay closer to the shopping area but you would definitely pay way more & you probably dont get parking included which this hotel did have. Finally, there is no restaurant here but we found 3 great ones within walking distance thanks to the amazing staff. I would highly recommend staying here as long as you don't mind a monorail ride to get to the market and are willing to venture out for meals.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boise, Idaho", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "LosReyes", "ReviewID": "UR115085793", "Content": "My wife and I were in town for the U2 concert.

From a a first time in Seattle person I felt I had arrived in nowhere land although that could have been the rain. The staff sent us down to a breakfast place that seemed to be the only place in the area open. It was quite good. When we got back I saw the staff checking in people and I went up and asked to be checked in as well. I was told I had a room with a view that was not ready and the other people didn't. At that point the kids and I went exploring and found we really weren't so far from many attractions including the Space Needle. we went on a Duck Tour which was really fun and then got something to eat at a food court that was lively and had music. We got back at 3:00 -check in time. And guess what no room. At 4:00 we checked in. The room was very nice and quite large. Guess what our view was of - the parking garage. I had to laugh by that time and was just glad to be in a room. We enjoyed the in door pool and were the only people in it. I could have gone for a spa - but it was nice anyway. The next day I went down to get the breakfast sandwiches and drinks included in the package. The staff appeared confused about how to handle it but did give me the food and were nice. The transportation to the airport was on time and efficient.. We later came back and stayed at the Inn At the Market.

The pool area and gym looked clean and well-appointed, but we didn't have time to try it out. We will definitely try to use them next time we stay here.

So from the hotel you are a walk from museums, the waterfront, and tourist sites and a beautiful hilly neighborhood with charming houses and great views and neighborhood restaurants. We went to the Seattle Art Museum and waterfront one day, but then ate at neighborhood spots. We also went for walks just up the hill and around Queen Anne just looking at the houses and stopping to look at the views of Mt. Rainer on one side, and the mountain range on the other side. The hotel made a major mistake in our booking - we had signed up for a package that included a 2 hour cruise of the lake, and when we got there they had not purchased the cruise tickets and could not get us onto another. BUT, the way they handled it was inpeccable and left us feeling initially disappointed, of course, but no lasting pain. The manager came up to the room immediately in person, with a bottle of champagne, to personnaly appologize and offered to comp one night of hotel plus arrange for a lovely brunch (on them) on the waterfront the next day. I think the in-person apology and quick response and rearrangement plus the comped night were as good a response as one could hope for, and we appreciated them. Anyone can make a mistake, and they dealt with it very well. If you were booking a package, I would confirm and reconfirm. The Maxwell has hardwood floors which initially sounded good, but actually is a little hard on the feet after a day of walking on pavement. Beds VERY comfortable, nice bathroom with excellent lighting, quiet despite busy neighborhood, free parking. Front desk staff other than the manager were clueless - asked for several tips about the neighborhood and none of them knew anything about the neighborhood. Japanese restaurant? Had to look it up but there was a great one just down the street whcih we found. Desert at night? No clue but there was a coffee and pastry shop right down the street which we found. What restaurants and stores were at the top of the hill? No clue but we walked up and found great stuff. So don't count on the front desk people.

Just insert a Tully's coffee pod into the maker and you have coffee in seconds . No messing with filters and packets--and delicious coffee served in the cutest Maxwell Hotel mug. Heaven!

We chose this hotel for a family Victoria Day long weekend get away. The hotel was offering a buy 2-nights get 1-night free so we decided to try it after reading the reviews on TA. The hotel is located within walking distance from the Space Needle. We arrived in Seattle by the Victoria Clipper ferry and used the Town Car service to get to the hotel (cost us $20). Taxis are also available at the ferry terminal but we opted for Town Car because of the size of our party. You get a variety of restaurants and coffee shops near the hotel (Thai, Vietnamese, Greek, Italian, etc.). There's even a small supermarket closeby. Make sure to try Toulouse on Queen Anne Street for breakfast (loved their Creole dishes) or dinner at Gloria's Greek Deli (as featured on DDD). Great food and atmosphere. We found the front desk very friendly and helpful, especially Melanie. Overall, the service was excellent. The pool was small but just perfect for our little ones. They loved the complementary \"kids cart\" that came with games, legos and other goodies. Request the cart when you check in and they will bring it up to your room, if it's available. The hotel also has a small fitness room with treadmills and exercise equipments. The lobby is huge with a warm fireplace and lots of sitting areas. Parking is free, but not enough stalls for larger vehicles. We had a mini van, and only on one occasion, we couldn't find a stall that wasn't a tight fit. Our Prima Donna room was spacious (2 kings and a sofa bed), modern through out and very clean. Large flat screen TV with lots of channels, Keurig coffee machine with complementary coffee, free water bottles everyday and popcorn for the microwave all made our stay very enjoyable. The bed is very comfortable if you prefer soft mattress and fluffy pillows. The large bathroom came with a jetted tub and rainfall shower. Only complaint is that there's no fan so it can get little steamy if you like long hot showers. We enjoyed walking around the Space Needle park area and the big water fountain. Our 4 year old joined in the fun with the other kids running through the water sprays and getting all wet. We also spent a day at the Woodland Park Zoo which had a special dinosaur exhibit at the time. The animals were amazing to watch; there's even a petting zoo for the kids. We saw everything from penguins to snow leopards. A must visit if you have small children who love animals. For shopping, we went to the Premium Outlet (45 minutes by car) and downtown Seattle department stores (5 minutes from where we are). Stocked up on sports clothing at the new Under Armour store from the Outlet. If you need a car for the day, you can conveniently rent one from the downtown Hilton Hotel (Alamo/National). Lots of stores but not enough time. All in all, I would say the Maxwell is a small-to-medium family oriented hotel with all the amenities of the high end downtown hotels, but without the extra costs.

She was short and snappy with any questions that I had. I asked her where the stairs were to get to the 2nd floor, she told me, obnoxiously, there weren't any and that I'd have to take the elevator and she looked at the man standing next to her and rolled her eyes. I thought that was a joke, I mean what hotel doesn't have stairs? Also, telling me \"good luck in finding a parking space\" However, upon checking out 2 days later, the gentlemen at the front desk were more than helpful with any questions I had and even with helping me locate a cart for my luggage. The maid service was also very friendly in asking how I was and if I needed anything. Quirk #2, The curtains on the 2nd floor are see thru, which meant that the people outside could see in, I even had a complete stranger start waving at me from the street and there was no way to close them. Not comfortable at all knowing that anyone could see in. Quirk #3, You can hear very clearly thru the walls and since there are nice hardwood floors, you can also hear the people above you walking around and babies crying next door. Parking wasn't really an issue, it was secured and right under the hotel so I didn't have to walk our into the rain or pay for parking. The wireless internet kept going in and out and was hard to get access to. The bathroom was amazing. It's size was perfect and it had plenty of space and counter space, the open shower was a nice touch as well. The room decor was a perfect flow with the contemporary hotel feel.

There were a few things that did not lessen my opinion of how awesome the hotel was, but could be a potential dealbreaker for others. You can really hear the people walk around and roll luggage on the floor above you pretty clearly. The nice big tvs in the rooms had a shelf near it that looked convenient if I had brought a video game console. However from what I could tell, there were only had composite video inputs and not the hdmi I would have preferred. Also, the hd channels on the tv weren't on the hotel provided channel listings, but were there way past of all the other sd channels and seemed to be a pretty random selection of what was there. The shower was designed to not need any sort of curtain or door, but it seemed to me that to make it work and not get water all over the bathroom the shower head was pointed towards a corner and was not adjustable at all. That made the very roomy shower seem kinda cramped as I had to huddle in the corner of the shower to stay in the water flow. All of that said, I loved, loved, loved the Maxwell Hotel!

When we arrived I was surprised to see how modern and new it was, the lobby was huge and a great place to lounge. The front desk told us the hotel would be one year old in two days. They were extremely friendly and even helped me find a tire shop where I could fix the nail in my tire that I encountered on the drive down. He printed a map for me and all the contact info. It was very helpful since I didn\u2019t know that part of town. We stayed on the 3rd floor looking out to the parking lot, not a big deal for me since I knew there would be no traffic and noise. The rooms were amazing and very clean\u2026I love the Keurig coffee makers (you could choose what flavor of coffee or even make tea). They are way better than those cheap coffee makers in other hotels. There was a nice LCD hanging on the wall that actually gets HD channels if you scroll the channels high enough (it doesn\u2019t mention it on the channel guide they give you). This was the first hotel that I stayed at that had true HD quality. Plus free internet and parking\u2026you can\u2019t go wrong! I forgot to mention the pillows\u2026nice big fluffy pillows and 4 on each bed. I really only needed one, but the more the merrier. Only problem I had with our room was the hardwood floors\u2026you can hear people walking above you. We were lucky to have people that weren\u2019t heavy on their feet and only heard them once in a while. Great location with plenty of restaurants and walking distance to the Space Needle and monorail that takes you downtown. The only disappointment we had was that the pool was closed for a couple of days during our stay. I mentioned that to the front desk. They said there was some blood found by the pool and they had to drain the entire pool and fill it. I thought that was great for them to do it for safety reasons and it showed this hotel has a concern for their guests. Most hotels would mop up the mess and add a little more chlorine in the water and be done with it. I really wasn\u2019t expecting anything, but because of the pool not being open. The front desk person gave us a discount coupon for our next stay. Plus he told us to ask for him the next time we make a reservation and he will give us a great discount. Now that\u2019s what I call customer service\u2026very proactive. We didn\u2019t even have to ask!

First of all, parking is free, which is a big deal in Seattle. It is also very secure, requiring a room key to open the garage door. This hotel is a two block walk from the Space Needle, so it is not in downtown. However, it is still convenient to downtown since you can catch the monorail from the Space Needle to the Westlake Center Mall at 5th and Pine. A one-way trip is $2 per adult, 75\u00a2 per child, double that for a round-trip. Note that if your room faces the Space Needle there are telescopes up there and people can see right into your room if you leave the curtains open. We found that out when we went up there and could see our jackets on the chair by the window! The hotel is brand new so everything is new and clean. The rooms are beautiful and the beds are very comfortable, even the sofabed in our room made for a wonderful night's sleep. We had two king beds and a sofabed in our room so we had a lot of room for our family of 5 (3 adults, an 11 year old and a 14 year old). There was a lot of room for our luggage, and we had plenty of luggage. It wasn't a suite so there was one bathroom and one t.v. for the 5 of us to share, but as long as we could all stay together we were happy. There is free wifi in the room, and also a business center in the lobby. There are no restaurants in the hotel, except for a little snack shop in the lobby. We saw many restaurants nearby though and the hotel staff can recommend some others for you if you ask. It is convenient to Interstate Highway 5, if you head east on Mercer Street which is a block south of the hotel. The front desk staff was very nice but there was a little communication problem between them and the housekeeping staff. We needed 5 bath towels in our room every day and told the front desk to notify housekeeping about our request, but we had to ask for extra towels every day. It was a minor detail that we could overlook though. We loved the decor of the hotel (art deco perhaps?) and how new everything was.

We used to live in Seattle and watched the building being constructed but didn't realize that a hotel was going to be a tenant. It is about three minutes walk from McCaw Hall which hosts the Seattle Opera and Pacific Northwest Ballet, the Seattle Repertory Theater, probably one of the best repertory theaters on the West Coast and the Intiman Theater, another repertory theater. It is also very close to Seattle Center. Our room was a standard queen room and was more than adequate in size with an easy chair and desk with a comfortable desk chair. The desk itself was a generous size for working with power outlets above the level of the desk, no need to scramble underneath the desk to plug in one's equipment. There was also an Ethernet connection but I never used it so I cannot comment on it's capabilities, we did use the WiFi and that proved to be stable and with adequate performance, Web pages loaded quickly. The walls were in a muted yellow which may sound a little bilious but were in fact pleasing to the eye. The bathroom was large and contained a toilet, large sink (I can't remember if there was one sink or two) and a walk-in shower, but no tub. The shower had no door but there was minimal splashing onto the floor. Water temperature and pressure were both excellent. The lighting was good in the bathroom but, as in many hotels, in the drive towards ecology they use fluorescent lights which means that it takes about 60 seconds for the bathroom lights to output full power. There was a nice selection of toiletries, however, in the design of the bottles form overcomes function. The bottom of the bottles are tapered so it is impossible to stand them upright, consequently the liquid has a tendency to drip out of them while they are lying laterally. The towels were large and soft, better than average for a hotel and there were two robes. The room contained a larger than average sized safe (which we didn't use) and an iron and ironing board, along with a refrigerator and microwave. The public spaces are bright, well lit and filled with hotel level contemporary art. The parking is complimentary in an adjacent garage, a non trivial benefit in Seattle where parking can be expensive. We didn't use either the pool or the gym so I cannot comment. There are a couple of possible disadvantages depending on one's circumstances. There is no restaurant and breakfast is a bit of an oddity. There are packaged items for sale and there appeared to be staff on duty in a kitchen in the mornings to microwave the packaged food. It didn't look particularly appetizing and the setup seemed a little odd to me. Unfortunately there aren't many good breakfast establishments in the immediate neighborhood. The second possible negative is the location. It is in Lower Queen Ann and there are numerous excellent restaurants available for dinner. It is however, somewhat out of the center of Seattle (defining the center as around the Convention Center and the shopping area of Pacific Center and Nordstrom). Off peak it is about a 5+ minute drive from the hotel to the center, during the day it can take up to 15 minutes. Alternatively there are buses within a 15 minute walk that will take one downtown. The hotel is also a little inconvenient to get to from the highway. The exit (Mercer St) can become very congested in the evenings and due to Seattle's one way system in that area getting to the hotel on city streets can be convoluted and can take anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes. Getting to the highway from the hotel is considerably easier (except at evening commute time).

Coffee shop right in the lobby, umbrellas for convenience, early evening coffee and cupcakes on the house, nice lobby area allowing for some intimacy. Decor: Interior design is spot on: kudos to the designer. This is definitely not decor for you Victorian lovers - no stuffiness here. It's all about fun and vibrancy - could be a bit much for some, but I enjoyed it. My partner thought it was a bit over the top - perhaps it is, but how fun! Rooms: The rooms are not wall to wall carpet - just a rug for the bed. I prefer this for cleanliness reasons, but sound is impacted by it. Nice entry way (hall if you will) so shoes can be kept outside of the room. There is a table in the hall for your keys and such. Roomy bathroom with lots of cubby areas to keep things and plenty of counter space. Reading chair w/ foot stool and lamp, desk, fridge, microwave (free popcorn), coffee maker, wood hangers, ironing board, hairdryer, big TV with a lot of channels and a dvd player - good if you want to watch your own thing. Curtains which will not allow one speck of light to shine through. Alarm clock with 2 alarm settings, and not too annoying of an alarm - so the neighbor's won't wake you up. And this place is clean. I know it is new and perhaps that is why, but I hope they will continue to keep it clean. This hotel seems to have been constructed and designed well so hopefully the cleaning staff will be trained well and have enough pride, and get enough pay to keep it clean. Beds: I think they have a fluff top - I'm a fan of a firmer bed, but it was comfy enough. Complaints: Hooks - always a complaint of mine - why are there never hooks in hotels. Especially noticeable here because of the hallway. It would be so great to be able to hang my coat in the hallway; on those rainy days in particular - which is so often in Seattle. We had two wet coats and nowhere to place them to dry. Just one hook in the bathroom - why? I would like to place my pajamas on a hook. Not a big deal - just something that would be nice. Fitness: They have very minimal equipment. Pool is a square - not a lap: more for fun and relaxation. Parking: No complaints. I have a compact. Always had a space. Parking garage is secure.

We had been a bit concerned about limited parking spaces based on previous reports, but we needn'y have worried. The (free) underground car park has (approx) 50-60 spaces so there was never any problem getting a space during our stay. Yes the spaces are narrow by US standards, but we had no problem reversing our full-size rental car into a space. The large lobby of the hotel is very strikingly decorated, with lots of bright colours and looks very stylish. There are lots of chairs and tables, but as there's no bar, there was no particular reason to provide so much furniture in this area. Check-in was fine and the receptionists were very helpful and friendly - really making us feel welcome after a long flight. Our standard \"Queen Aria\" room was more than adequate for our needs, and was like the rest of the hotel, absolutely spotless and new looking with very attractive furnishings and decor. We also liked the little touches such as the popcorn and the microwave. The bed was extremely comfortable and we slept fine despite some jetlag. The hotel has a free business centre with 2 PC's plus printer, which was extremely useful for making travel bookings and last minute research on things to see - a really helpful facility that all hotels should have. The local area is very quiet (in a good way), but well located for easy access to I5, and on foot to the Space Needle/monorail. There is a (limited) selection of about 7 or 8 restaurants/cafes in the area plus some fast food places, mainly about 4 blocks to the west, so within about 10 minutes walk. There's also a Thai restaurant right next door to the hotel which was pleasant enough on a rainy evening.

There's an AMAZING thai fusion restaurant - Asian Breeze - just down the street. Everything is delicious and very reasonably price. Plus the decor is trendy and unique. The monorail and light rail system made getting downtown extremely easy, and very affordable. Sure beats $20 cab rides everywhere. The cute mini cupcakes and coffee @ 3pm was a nice touch.

I checked with the front desk and they told me that metered parking is free on Sunday or I could find parking in the resident area up on the hills. I circled around the neighborhood 3 times and couldn't find any metered parking. I was unsure about parking in the residential area since the signs said no parking without permits and I saw a parking enforcement guy giving out tickets at 9 PM on a Saturday night! I decided to park my car further up on the hill next to a bush. I told the front desk where I parked my car and expressed my concerns about getting a parking ticket. The two lovely ladies who were working at the time told me that I should be fine, and not to worry about it. The next morning, I found a parking ticket attached to the wind shield. The parking ticket was for $49! I took the ticket back to the front desk and to my surprise they said they will take care of it and apologized for the inconvenience.

The Maxwell is in the center of it all, a couple of blocks from the space needle, in fact you could see it just sitting in the area out front of the Hotel, an $8 cab ride to Pike's Market, the Waterfront or the Quest Stadium where we saw the season opener--so fun! The Hotel had the friendliest staff I've ever experienced, truly pleasant happy people ready and willing to do whatever they could to make your stay as nice as it could be. The Hotel is new so everything is very clean and nice. It is sharply decorated with a lot of bright colors kind of art deco like. The beds were very comfortable with a lot of wonderful down like pillows. Our room had hardwood like floors, a first for me in a hotel, but I really liked it, felt spacious and clean. Great big flat screen T.V., the bathroom was very nicely done, lighted mirror, nice bath products and soft towels. Great lighting fixures in the rooms too, soft light. We were on the 3rd floor and it was completely silent so sleep was great, however, it was during the week? Free parking though we didn't need it, that is a HUGE consideration in Seattle, and the Maxwell's prices, well you just won't find better for equitable accomodations anywhere. There is also a lovely indoor pool. There is no restuarant so no room service, or bar, but they do have a small coffee shop in the lobby where you can get coffee, muffins, a few other drinks/snacks which was nice. And, they service the most yummy pineapple mini cupcakes and coffee, complimentary, every afternoon at 2:00 p.m. Overall a great value, and we will definitely be staying at the Maxwell on our next visit to Seattle and there will definitely be a next visit! Just a tip if you're up for a great dinner, especially seafood, Ivars down at the Waterfront is out of this world!!! Beautiful location right on the water, great bar and restuarant, the food was just incredible, some of the best wine my husband and I have ever had, really a great dinning experience...a tiny bit pricy though, but worth it!

We would definitely stay there again. My complaints: Twice I asked for emailed confirmation 2 wks. prior to arrival but it was never sent. When checking in and only upon my asking, the room rate did not agree with what I negotiated for on the phone but was quickly corrected ($142/night + taxes). I asked the check-in gal if our view was \"fairly decent and of what?\". She responded that it was mostly the \"neighborhood\" - so okay, I knew my room rate was pretty low. However, the view was actually about 85% of the parking lot - WOW - what an overstatement. The bathroom door squeaked terribly but was quickly fixed by one of the staff who used a spray of WD 40 type of product on the hinges. This resulted in oil residue on the wall and floor and this was never cleaned nor noticed by the cleaning staff. There was a large patch of long hair on the drain in the shower that I had to remove the first night. Other than this, we were pleased. It was quiet; we never heard a thing from others. The free daily mini cupcakes & coffee were terrific. The free use of hotel-provided computers near the lobby, at very fast speed, was a great convenience for us, too. We really liked the ambiance in the lobby and in walkways. Also, very thoughtfully, on the only morning that it was raining a little, the hotel put out a large container filled with umbrellas for us to use - a big help. The walk to the Sp. Needle (worth the outrageous charge) is a good but easy 6-7 min. with the monorail right there, too. The free pic they take of you there will not arrive for ten days, btw. A previous reviewer saId you could walk to Pike Mkt. but I heartily disagree unless you're willing to invest probably 45 min. to do so. All in all, a great hotel; we'll be back.

We chose the Maxwell Hotel because of this. We had a king size bed room on the 4th floor. The stay was slightly less than average. Pros to the hotel include: spacious rooms with microwave and fridge. Bedding was very comfortable and room was made up quickly, even on a Sunday when I assume there was plenty of room turnover and fewer staff working. The neighborhood is eclectic and has some good lunch/dinner locations. It within walking distance to the space needle area if one is looking for that. The cons were numerous. Although the hotel advertises free parking, it is actually quite limited. The spaces are SMALL and several larger cars had no choice but to occupy two spaces. We attempted to park at about 9:00 on a Saturday night. There was no parking and the front desk advised us that plenty of free street parking was available and that there would be no charge on a Saturday night-Sunday. FALSE- there is plenty of street parking, BUT if you park there overnight, you will receive a ticket unless you have a residential permit for that area. Luckily, we ran into a parking ticketer who advised us that the only safe parking was in a pay garage. We payed 16.00 for one overnight stay. Luckily, on Sunday night, there were plenty of garage spaces. My guess is that as long as you are not at the hotel on the weekend, parking will not be an issue. Still, a disappointment that front desk staff incorrectly advised us. Other cons include the noise level by the elevators. There was a wedding going on in the basement and we clearly heard the band in our room on the 4th floor by the elevator. I advise guests to ask for a room away from the elevator on a weekend night. While the guest services book advises that the front desk cashes checks up to 50.00, they in fact only cash travelers checks. The front desk was unable to advise us on a location of a cash machine. The hotel has no restaurant on property, and the closest breakfast spot is a 4-5 block walk. They do have a small store which sells water, soda, snacks, and pharmacy items. All in all, a nicely appropriated and comfortable cheaper hotel WITHOUT fantastic guest service. Be mindful of parking and room selection, and you can most likely make it on your own.

The rate was $125 a night with free parking. The free parking was important to us as we drove into Seattle and had to leave the car parked there over the long weekend. We hate valet parking because it is so expensive and we don't like other people driving our cars, so this hotel was ideal. They have an underground parking garage (though small) and guests can use it for free. We checked in pretty late at night and the garage was full, but they allowed us to park the car in guest check-in parking just until the morning. Then in the morning we moved the car to the garage after everyone had left for the day, and we left the car there all weekend so we wouldn't lose the space. All the employees were extremely friendly from the reception people to the cleaning staff. We stayed in an Aria room (1 king size bed) and it had a Keurig coffee maker, microwave, mini fridge, flat panel TV mounted on the wall, and a DVD player. The bathroom did not have a bathtub, just a walk in shower, but I never take baths at hotels anyway because you never know how clean it is, so I liked having a walk in shower a lot. The floors in the rooms are wood which is nice for sanitary reasons because hotel carpet can be very scary. I think the wood floor was a good call particularly since this hotel is pet-friendly, so the floors are easy to clean probably. I thought the decor was very well done all around. It is very obvious the time and thought put into each piece from the floor plan to the draperies to the furniture. For example, there was a full length mirror on the wall in the room. Next to the mirror was a little shelf (marble I think) and right under the shelf was an electrical outlet--a perfect place to charge your electronics or blow dry your hair if someone else is using the bathroom. Things like that don't cost a whole lot, but those kinds of details make the experience more hospitable all around and people DO notice those details. Yes, the other reviewers are right that it can be a little noisy at times due to the thin walls. However, I found that between floors was very solid. I never heard anyone walking above us and you could jump or stomp on the floor without fear that you would disturb the people below. So really you're only hearing noises from the rooms on either side and even then it's not THAT bad. We turned the closed captioning on on the TV so that we didn't disturb anyone else because you can hear the TV if the people next to you are watching it. My one criticism is that, while the bed was extremely comfortable, I didn't care for the sheets or the bedspread. I like my sheets to feel cool and crisp when I move my legs on them, and their sheets feel stiff and scratchy. Also there is no blanket in between the top sheet and the bedspread so if you use just the sheet you get cold, but if you use the sheet and the bedspread it is too hot. I would have liked a lighter blanket in between the sheet and bedspread. The pillows were heavenly. They lay out bite-sized cupcakes in the afternoons in the lobby that have a little slice of pineapple stuck in the icing. We had one and thought they were pretty good. It was a nice treat. There is a giant mosaic tile pineapple on the floor in the lobby--pretty cool. I could see this hotel being a chain because they carried the theme throughout so thoughtfully. We didn't use the bikes or the espresso bar, but it was nice they had those there in case someone wanted something. The location is FANTASTIC. It is one block from the ballet, Teatro ZinZanni, and a short walk further is the Space Needle and the Experience the Music Project. Pike Place Market is about 3 miles away and a fun walk, too. I did some research on this hotel after we stayed there because it was such a nice place and I discovered that it is owned by Columbia West Properties which is still a family-owned business. My hunch is that has something to do with why the people working at this hotel were so friendly and it was run so well. I've stayed in hotels in 6 countries and all over the U.S. and this hotel stay was very memorable in a good way. I really like that we patronized a family-owned business and not some corporation who couldn't care less about our experiences at the hotel.

I could not have been more thrilled with the location. The access to Seattle Center was super quick and I was at the arena or on the monorail to downtown five minutes from my door. My first impressions of the hotel are that it is stylish, spacious and welcoming. The staff was lovely, except for the maid who twice failed to see my \"do not disturb\" sign and knocked anyway, and the tiny cupcakes in the afternoon are a memorable touch. The rooms are unique and very comfortable for sleeping, working at a desk or watching the absolutely enormous televisions, not so great for eating in or reading as there is no \"tea table\" or really good cozy chair. I tried the DVD player but could not get it to work which was a disappointment. The wood floors were very attractive and I had no problem with room noise around me. As someone who loves a long soak after sightseeing, I guess the lack of a tub in the bathrooms my biggest drawback to this new property. While the open showers are hugh and aesthetically pleasing, it is impossible to get really warm in them because they do not trap heat. I thought a dip in the pool might take the place of a good bath, but that too was chilly and ridiculously small. It was my bad luck to be swimming at the same time as a rowdy family of five with dive bombing kids and there literally was not room for all of us to enjoy the water. I longed for a hot tub. I also wished for a few more food options coming in late from the concert or early in the AM. The tiny espresso bar in the hotel has mostly sugary junk food, sodas and juices.

They have beautiful hardwood floors in the rooms, but that means you can hear your upstairs neighbor clomping around at all hours. Also, and even harder to ignore, was that the doors are very heavy, and don't have any slow-stop close, so throughout our entire stay, any time anyone in our hall closed the door it was easily heard in our room. SLAM! 2. We got \"upgraded\" to a room with 2 Queen beds instead of the 1 King we'd reserved. Who wants to spend the night at a hotel and go down a size in bed? So my husband and I ended up having our own beds for our anniversary celebration. :( Lame. Plus this \"upgrade\" was supposed to be a \"view room\" and our view was of a parking garage. The Space Needle was directly behind a big tree. 3. No restaurant in hotel = no room service for breakfast (or anytime, for that matter). 4. No movie channels, or movies to rent on TV. Might not usually be a big deal, and they have a DVD player in the room, but who goes to a hotel with their favorite DVD packed?

I typically look for a clean, newer hotel in a good location that is under $200/night. I don't care that much about having people park my car or turn down my bed. If this is what you need, look no further. This appears to be a brand new hotel. It smells like new lumber; kind of how my house smelled when it was newly built. The interior design is contemporary, interesting, and bright. It has many amenities. The pool is smallish, but OK for kids. They have a coffee kiosk (it is after all Seattle) that is inexpensive but not overwhelming in terms of quality. The rooms are great; very plush and comfortable. Fully equipped with flatscreen TV, microwave, fridge, etc. Beds are very comfortable. Floors are wood and tile. No tub, but I never use one anyway. It has a large tiled shower. Staff members are casual but polite. Only one glitch: I left some smoked salmon in the fridge and wanted to come back to pick it up. I called them right after checking out and they said they would check it out and get back to me. They didn't return my call and when I called back later they said it had been thrown out. Kind of frustrating although they were nice about it. Didn't offer to adjust the rate. The location is very good. It is close to the complex where the Space Needle and other attractions are. You can walk to several restaurants, but it takes a few minutes to do so. The area is safe for walking. They have free parking which is obviously a huge plus. All in all, this is a fantastic bargain. You won't find anything else in this area for under $150.

Cons: LOUD due to the wood laminate floors in rooms, traffic noise if you are at the front of the hotel, poor water pressure (water saving shower heads), small, did I mention loud?

Because my car had been broken into before in this vicinity, we took my handgun into the hotel and locked it in the safe. Aside from the gum lowlifes leave on the floor in the parking garage and walkways, the cleanliness was good. Our room had good location and decor but as mentioned before by other reviewer... the insulation for sound is on par with a prefabricated manufactured home. If you are lonely and spent $163 dollars to be close to other people, this allows you to know when your neighbor is upstairs or next door. Its great at a hotel when you see few other guests but can still hear them. My wife and I were on our anniversary and I hope they could hear us too:0 So aside from lack of sound insulation, I was having general good impression of the place until... I left my HK40 locked in the safe. called and talked with receptionist who refered me to Keith. Keith asked for safe code and told me he would put it in the hotel safe. I suggested that I'd come Sunday for it but he said the manager Linda would not be there and she had sole access (combo) to safe. Keith said Monday was holiday so Tuesday was next workday. He then called and said Linda thought that was too long. I said I would come tomorrow then and call if I could not come tomorrow (Friday). Now the slick part... I hate it when you talk directly with someone multiple times working out details and then?!?!? .... that person and others do whatever they feel is convenient to him or them and this has lasting inconvenience. Linda told Keith to call the police and officer Monson 4161 was asked to take my gun. This ended up with it being impounded and I got 4 more calls from cops. I can pick up the gun between 8-5pm after a background check which takes 2 days. Tuesday at the earliest. So then today as I was getting out of my car with my bum R wrist, I was held hostage by a guy with a box cutter who stole my kids candy while I said \"I see you brought a knife to a gunfight\" and pulled out my empty hand . nah not really. I'll just stay in my house gunless. So Linda was uncomfortable locking away my gun where she has \"sole access\". Keith was too secretive to call me before mucking up my whole next 4 days. He thought I was calling to request help but actually helping me.... bah call the cops and confiscate my legally owned and purchased gun for which I have a concealed carry permit. Peter says I can leave a message... for Linda, then that she would call but she did not. I would suggest recommend this hotel to anyone out of prison or of color. The Maxwell House will make you feel at home if you are accustomed to being treated with, suspicion, distrust and disregard. If you like to have police involved at every step of the way and the hotel responsible make excuses and ignore you. I should have booked another night tonight then drove back tomorrow to get the gun in the morning. Being honest and asking for help was a mistake. I berate myself for this failure. I mean I left a gun in a safe.... how foolish. I only paid for one night and only $163.

We had a wonderful time in spite of the weather!", "Date": "April 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kitsap County", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable stay in a great location\u201d", "Author": "tycoon2010", "ReviewID": "UR60440881", "Content": "I stayed at the Maxwell with my wife and 12-year old child for a close-to-home vacation. The location of the hotel made it so easy to explore parts of Seattle with which we weren't familiar. Exploring the Queen Anne neighborhood was great, including close proximity to a \"spa\" for our daughter which was a nice treat. \"Teatro Zinzani\" is right across the street and there are many excellent restaurants within walking distance (a great grocery store too!). Key Arena and the Seattle Center is a block away as well as several of Seattle's theatrical stages. Free parking made it easy to drive somewhere and not worry about hassles when returning. The decor of the lobby and the rooms is bright and modern without being stark. Very friendly and accomodating staff. The pool may be small but it served us very well. We used the work-out room as well. Having a pool was important to us and we were not disappointed.", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cFirst Review - Opened March 22, 2010\u201d", "Author": "pgo", "ReviewID": "UR60051037", "Content": "I was lucky enough to stay at the Maxwell for four nights during its inaugural week. The rate was a bargain, the parking and internet were free, the rooms had two queen beds and there was even a small pool, all of which are hard to find in this neighborhood. It promises to be a popular hotel with young, hip customers. The attention-seeking decor features circus colors and reflects every design fad of 2009. It's very of-the moment. The staff was well-trained and made the stay particularly pleasant.
