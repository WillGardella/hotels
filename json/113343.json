We found the hotel nicely decorated and the staff (especially Charisma) to be very helpful. When we first arrived, we were directed to our room but when we entered there was a problem with the washroom floor. I went straight to reception and told Charisma about it. She moved us straight away without any problem at all and apologised profusely. When we entered our room, there's no denying it was small but we expected that as it was a boutique hotel. Saying that, it was a king-size bed in the room, with a small closet and desk. There was also a small flat screen tv and a good sized en-suite. Having seen previous reviews claiming that the shower cubicles are small just seems silly. I am a big person and I found the shower absoloutly fine so please pay no heed to those claims. The shower was actually really good - great pressure and got nice and hot which was good in the December weather. I liked the decor of the room, which is bright and colourful and the painted bedside tables were really nice. There was one drawback, and that was the way the room was heated; as the hotel is connected to the NY steam system, there is no way to turn the thermostat down. Sometimes the room was too hot but I was able to open the window and use the ceiling fan so that was fine. The staff on reception were really more than helpful and helped us plan where to eat and what things in the city to see. They even organised a shuttle bus to take us back to the airport which saved us over $70! Overall, we really liked the hotel! It's ideal to see a city like New York; you are so busy the whole time you are there that you really just need your room as a base to wash and sleep. There is no facility to buy drinks (soft or otherwise) in the hotel but just on the street there is a liquor store, a 24 hour grocery store, a starbucks, countless places to eat and a bank. Also, the subway station is right outside the hotel which takes you straight to places like Times Square. Dont let the bad reviews put you off, this hotel is a great price and we honestly couldnt fault it. If you go in expecting 5star luxury then you will be disappointed, but, at the end of the day, you're not paying 5star prices. Thank you to all the staff at the Marrakech Hotel from Jemma and Andrew from Scotland. I hope someone got the use from those subway passes we left! :) p.s We will be back!", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cBetter than I imagined!\u201d", "Author": "Nicole M", "ReviewID": "UR125074224", "Content": "I stayed here for four nights and would do it again in a heart beat.

I called the hotel to ask for a room on the second floor so I would not have to climb more stairs than necessary. The person who responded was very courteous and told me I would have a room on the second floor, which I indeed got when I checked in. The staff was friendly and polite. We easily found someone to help us carry our 2-baby stroller on the way in and out. Our night there was pleasant. The room was small, but nicely painted and decorated. Like the other reviewers, I think the heating system is a bit of a problem, as there is no way to adjust the temperature. In our case, it was actually a bit chilly in the room and there was nothing we could do to increase the heat. I enjoyed the neighborhood and the subway was very close. We came by car and thought it would not be too difficult to find a parking spot on the street, but after going in circles for 20 minutes, I decided to pay for covered parking.

Well, the Marrakech Hotel is highly specialized in stairs, uncontrollable heating and cooling and tiny rooms--even by NYC standards. I booked the room as a \"Top Secret\" on Travelocity, which is another story--stick with Priceline or Hotwire. The only big plus for this property is that it is directly across the corner from the 103rd Street stop on the #1 subway line, making access to where you really want to be in Manhattan very convenient. The neighborhood is decent, and there is a selection of decent restaurants withing a one block walk, as is a very well stocked grocery store. The lobby is one flight of stairs up from the street, and rooms are on that floor and four more above that--all without elevators. The first room we were assigned was at the back of the building. When we walked in, the heat was overwhelming--as in hotter than any Swedish sauna I've ever been in--and the window was wide open in December. We were told that it was central steam heat and that there was nothing to be done, except turn on the a/c. The room was furnished with a queen bed, which I gave a quick inspection for bed bugs (no evidence of infestation), and a cheap set of shelving. Not acceptable. A brief interview with the manager at the front desk got us moved to another room at the front (Broadway) side of the building which seems to be on a different heating system. This room was slightly larger, and the bathroom was almost double the size of the first room. And while we still had no direct control over the heat, other than opening and closing the window, it was at least habitable. Checked the bed for bedbugs...again no signs of infestation. Both rooms were at least clean on the surface, and the beds were both apparently relatively new, and comfortable. The heating system in our room started banging and clanging in the middle of the night for no apparent reason...it sounded like an old move of prisoners beating their tin cups against the jail cell bars. The shower was an adventure. The line between scalding and ice water was very delicate. Move the knob a hair too far either way, and you get one or the other. The hotel offers essentially no services other than the rooms. The lobby bar is closed, there is no food in the hotel. They do have porters to help with baggage, and they will also bring ice to your room. The front desk staff and the porters are all friendly and helpful, and clearly have great skill in dealing with surprised and disappointed customers. Bottom line.

I have stayed there three times. It is basic. Lots of stairs and the hallways are dark, and a maze of walls and corners, to find your little room. The closet was a cheaply constructed shelf with a white drapery over it. The walls are painted dark blues and reds Morrocan theme as they describe, no candle thank goodness, and cheaply put together. It is adequate but very closed in feeling. The lobby is a steep flight of stairs up onto the second floor of the five story building. Sometimes there is a young doorman sometimes not. A Starbucks is handy right outside the door outside, and the Subway #1 train going uptown and downtown again right outside your door on Broadway. excellent location. There are stores and eateries all around the neighbourhood and I always felt safe. Arties Deli and Zabars not too far away, and a nice Mexican Restauant steps away as well. The lobby is good, has a bar which never seemed to be open for business, but there is a computer corner and nice Moroccan style boutique bean bag kind of chairs and wicker with striped fabric pillows and exotic music. The staff is young and kind of uncaring to the needs and assistance of an older traveller. My lady friend fell down the stairs, and they would hardly help and guide her across the street to the M60 bus stop for her to get back to the airport. I purchased a cane in fact, so her ankel was badly swollen, The stairway was dark and the steps are not consistant in width. For students needing access in visiting the University, it would be ideal, the price is cheaper than every other hotel , and better than just a hostel . You will have your own bathroom and there is alway a shared bathroom and shower in each hallway for a cheaper rate. If you want to enjoy that. The bedding was nice, a white sheet collection, a multicoloured pretty light fixture and a window in the room. The side lamp did not work, and I felt quite closed in. A small tv and small bathroom they provide little soaps and the shampoos were used and half empty. I bring my own anyway. There is a grocery store next door, so buying bottled water and bananas and muffins for your room is easy. There is no fridge, but the window ledge will keep items on the cool side by the air conditioner. The place is fairly transit but I felt safe, and realized that it was affordable. Another hotel \"On The Ave\" was way more money basically a couple subway stops away, but I saved by staying Marrakech. For a lone travellor it is fine. I did recommend this place to a lady friend who was not accustomed to NYC high room rates, she thought the price was cheaper but I could tell she was Really feeling uncomfortable with the surroundings and stairs. A dreadful fall on the last day there. The hotel did nothing really to be supportive or even offer us anything complimentary , we simply wanted to move on and try to look at the trip in a positive way, even though it was unfortunate. They are Really lucky we did not sue. So many others in review mention the dark hallways and narrow steep stairs. I can not help but wonder, WHY do they not install brighter light bulbs down the stairs for saftey reason. I think they just do not really care. But it is a cheap place, you will hear talking and noise in the halls. Even at almost three hundred dollars a night, good grief. I have tried another place called the Belnord Hotel, also Upper West side, and found it better. I have written a reveiw on that one. I travel to NYC a lot and consider myself an expert and been there done that, so hope my review help you guys out. I just love NYC. The Marrakech has a great neighbourhood location, is basic, unique, and if you are not planning to hang out in your room alot, if would be perfect. Casual, most people in jeans and sports clothes, get the picture. Not for a big family, parents, your kids will be happy and fine there. Again Columbia University a couple blocks walk really nice area, 10 minute subway to Times Square. Trendy, artsy, and easy M60 bus from LaGuardia for a couple bucks. The bus is like a City tour going through Harlem, you see Apollo Theatre, and all the slices of life, that is a bonus itself, St. John The Divine Cathedral not far from the Marrakech, Central Park within walking distance, all in all I prefer more upscale, this place is for the budget traveller and I have never stayed in a hostel, not my thing, I like my own bathroom and security.

The atmosphere is very relaxed in the hotel and although there is no lift the door steward at the front did help my girlfriend with her case so it was not a problem at all. The staff also saved us money by helping us book cheaper transport back to the airport at the end of our stay. I would say that if you want to see New York at a reasonable price and not spend to much time in the hotel this is the ideal place however if you are looking for a nice hotel where you can spend lots of time I would look for somewhere else.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cCheap and cheerful\u201d", "Author": "Ethical_explorer", "ReviewID": "UR120291159", "Content": "This place is definitely cheap and cheerful.

Regarding the cleanliness of the hotel, there were no bugs, but the sheets were badly stained. The toiletries in the bathroom had been used and were half empty, the tile floor was sticky, the shower curtain had mildew on it and there was hair in the bathtub. Speaking of the bathroom, plumbing was terrible - the water would either be scalding hot or freezing cold, with no middle temperature. I ended up kneeling outside the tub and using a cup with water from the faucet to wash my hair. Finally, the night before I left I called over to the front desk and asked for a wake-up call at 3 a.m. and if they could arrange for a cab to meet me outside since I would be leaving at 3:30 in the morning. They confirmed and said that both requests would be taken care of. Three-fifteen rolls around, and my friend wakes me up in a panic because we didn't get the wake-up call. We call over to the front desk to find out why we didn't get a call and to make sure the cab was coming, and find that they had no record of the wake-up call request and that they aren't able to have a cab pick us up at a specific time. Overall, it was a bad experience and I would recommend staying at a different hotel based on those points. I understand you get what you pay for - in terms of size and amenities, this was definitely a \"get what you pay for hotel\" - but those factors make it worth spending a few extra dollars to avoid the inconvenience.", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cThe VERY BEST place to stay in NYC - Marrakesh Hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Maria_Shhh", "ReviewID": "UR100275647", "Content": "I stayed in the hotel from March 04 to March 11 and I loved it so much!

I even asked if I could have help with the luggage and the young man made a disgruntled sigh before disappearing into the back office where he had visibly kicked his feet up and played with his phone. The other was stumbling around the bar flirting like he was a prepubescent child. This is true, and I really wish I was making this up.

So, I'll start with the positive stuff. It's clean enough for a few nights. The mattress is firm and there are no bugs or mice as previously stated. Housekeeping made by bed and the location is great - the 1 train is across the street and there's a Starbucks downstairs. The stairs weren't bad for me - I was on the floor of the lobby which is 23 steps from the street. For New York prices, the beer selection is scant but decently priced. Here's the negative stuff. First I'll start with the stuff I know they can't change. The rooms are small. You know that small room in your home that you don't know what to do with so you leave it for boxes and \"stuff\"? That's your hotel room. There's no thermostat heat. You get a floor heater - I assume it's a plumbing issue with a historic building. The hot water is sporadic. At one point in my shower, I would be scalded and in a matter of seconds, it became luke warm. Now the stuff that needs to change. I get that people need jobs - however, I don't like that the college students who work here are allowed to play their music rather loudly at all hours of the night. I arrived extremely late due to flight delays and had to ask AT 1 AM for them to turn down the music. Now, it's almost 11pm on my second night and I'll have to ask AGAIN for the music to be turned down. I know people want to enjoy themselves, but I have a room and need sleep. That's what hotels are for! The language. While hanging out in the lounge, one coworker decided he needed to let ALL of us know what he thought about another coworker. As I'm writing this, I can hear them all talking about what they're doing tonight after their shifts outside of my door. The young lady, while very nice, has a voice that carries. And she's not a quiet person. I understand that I'm next to the lobby and conversation happens - perhaps a door needs to be set up to separate the party goers from those of us who are here truly just for a place to sleep. This is ridiculous. In conclusion, do yourself and your thighs a favor and get a room far from the lobby if you have to stay here. Deal with the dark decoration (it's a Moroccan-themed hotel) and don't expect much. And certainly don't pay full price. It's not worth it. The rooms are small, but this is New York City - everything is small. If past reviews have been any indication, the general manager will read this and post a message apologizing. I really do appreciate that this is being done, but I don't want to stay here again, I don't want to talk to the general manager the next time I'm in town. I want to forget that I was here and that I had to deal with the college kids outside my door throwing a party in the lounge. Oh yes, please make sure that Tv's have remotes. I can't recommend this place to tourists. If you're used to noise and the hustle and bustle of the city, this place probably won't bother you.

We found out the next morning that it was a drunken guest at the hotel and a neigbour had called the Police. That wasn't the hotel's fault but the reason the Police banged on our door was because they weren't escorted by hotel staff and they got the wrong room. On our last night while we were packing, we found that our food was chewed through by mice. We immediately went to report the problem at reception. The guy told us he'll make a note of the incident and asked us to take it up with the manager in the morning. We spoke to Keith the next day but he made an excuse that it was caused by the engineering work on the Metro, at one point he laughed. He didn't offer any compensation or seem too concerned with the situation. We had to ask for compensation which was agreed but we're yet to receive.

There was just a doorway on the street and led straight up stairs with dirty carpet and no lift or any way to get your luggage up apart from lugging them up yourself. The staff were friendly and approachable on check in. Upon going into my room the first thing was that it was very small with one very small double bed when we had been told would be two. The bedside cabinet was dirty and broken with no access to drawer. The phone didnt work, there were no hangers and the bed creaked very badly. The view from the window was of a brick wall immediately outside. The carpet was dirty and generally the entire room was grubby. There was no safe in the rooms exept for in reception. We asked for an iron and were bought some ice (about 20 mins later). Told them we ordered an iron and not ice and an hour later had to ask reception again, ending up going to housekeeping and getting one ourselves. Then we saw something on the headboard of the bed. I got some tissue and grabbed it and took it to reception, not sure what it was. Reception confirmed it was a cockroach, we told them we were not happy and would not stay in the room, so they moved us to another room at the other end of the hotel which was adequate but still small and shabby and meant climbing 5 flights of stairs with out luggage. Before leaving the room the first room there were two more cockroaches to be seen. The hotel said and l quote 'We do not have a problem with cockroaches', well they may not but I DO!! We moved to the other room as it was late by this time but did not sleep at all. (After being up for 36 hours travelling). In the morning phoned my travel agent to get me out of there and find me another hotel. which they did and we moved to the lower east side in the Bentley hotel which was amazing and perfect. So my advice would be avoid the Marrakesh hotel at all costs, its a terrible, dirty shabby hotel with dim lighting that covers a multitude of sins, including the cockroaches that 'they dont have a problem with' :-(.

Con: - Very thin wall, you can hear what is going on outside, downstairs, upstairs, next doors, etc. - No heater (will be an issue if stay during the winter time) - No remote for the TV - No closet space, there is a rack right next to the door that has a few hangers. - Don't expect the typical stuff you get from a hotel (room service, ironer, TV remote) - Small bathroom (a few minor things - shower doesn't work really hard - hard to adjust water temperatures, a few tiles in the shower were replaced ( you can totally tell, it's a different color), one of the bath towels provided was torn and has a hole in it) My conclusion - It's a motel, not a hotel.

My room had, as mentioned, a queen bed, a bedside tapble with reading lamp and telephone, flat screen tv with a lot of channels and pay per view movies, another small table under the tv with a CD radio alarm and a rack to hang clothes on. The lobby/bar are very charming. They're decorated in a marroccean style with very comfy couches and chairs. I spent ours there on one rainy evening, just curled up in one of the chairs reading a book and people watching. The hotel is on Broadway (corner 103rd street) but the subway station is right next to the hotel entrance and everything is easily accesible with the 1 train. The only minus point I give this hotel is that the A/C is build into the window, so if you have a room that goes out onto broadway it might get a little loud in the mornings but it wasn't so bad.

We booked with a budget in mind as it wasn't our only stop on the trip, and were more than pleasantly surprised by the size of the room and ensuite. Beds were comfortable, plenty of floor-space, storage was adequate, and more bedding/pillows were available no quibble on request from the front desk. Cleanliness was top notch. The shower was good, but it took a few days to really get the hang of getting it to stay at a given temperature. The location - mere steps from the 103rd St subway station - was fine. You were far enough away from the bustle of downtown, with the convenience of a short subway ride to wherever you want to go. The free wifi was just about available in our room, but that was a bonus as it is only really advertised as being available in the lobby/bar area, where connection was a breeze. Staff were helpful and courteous on the few occasions we had cause to deal with them. The decor was nice, especially around the lobby/bar, where the Moroccan theme is emphasised. Speaking of the bar area, a real gem of the stay was the red-headed barmaid named Heyden in the Kazbar Lounge. She was super cool, extremely talented (a future singing star) and genuinely made us feel welcome. In fact, when she was working, we never felt the need to venture out to find another bar. The only real downside is the lack of an elevator, which is a pain if you've got big luggage. There's probably not much that can be done to remedy that, given the location, but it should be a genuine concern for people who have trouble with stairs. It's one flight just to get to the lobby, then further flights from there to the different levels.

There is a starbucks next door to the hotel. Check was very quick and the people very friendly and helpful. We were stranded in new york because of the volcano. We had 4 rooms. 310 and 311 which were quite from traffic noise but no hotel noise, 408 which had a window that looked onto a brick wall which if you put your arm out the window you could touch and 416 which felt like you were sleeping outside on the pavement. Sheets, towels and bathrooms spotless clean (we ususally stay in the Westin at time square and found the cleanliness on the same lines as there). Unfortunately the walls are paper thin and you could hear next door pulling their shower curtain. The hotel is very dark which was a little worrying as we wondered what it was hiding. The corridors are painted a darkish blue with terracota door frames and the lights have metal/bronze shades over them making the corridors extremely dark, the rooms are painted in these dark colours and they are also very dark. My children have stayed in many hostels on their trips and said it was like staying there but the linen was cleaner. The carpet was stripey and when you walk down the stairs you have to look hard as the stripes make it hard to see where the step ends and the next begins. There are no lifts but the guys there were more than happy to help my 70 year of in laws with their bags (we actually felt sorry for them and we all carried our bags). Reception staff were lovely but the two girls we met serving behind the bar was very ignorant and felt like they were doing you a huge favour in serving you. There is a housing project development behind the hotel and I would not suggest walking through there. We used the subway at all times of the day and even coming home one night at 1:30am and it was perfectly safe and quite crowded. In short I would not stay there again but once i got in my room and saw it was clean I breathed a sigh of relief. There were no funny smells either.

I had been reluctant to book initially due to the number of negative reviews and was pleasantly surprised when I arrived. Overall, it's clean, comfortable, within a stone's throw of the subway and the staff are helpful and friendly, making it excellent value in my opinion. The hotel does play loud music in the lobby in the evening, which wasn't to my personal taste, but we weren't disturbed by this in our room (on the 4th) but were glad we weren't on the 2nd floor where the lobby is. Our room was comfortable and clean. My partner is 6ft2 and found the bed perfectly long enough for him. The room wasn't massive (double bed, bedside tables on each side and a bit of extra space) but we had enough hanging space (one of those metal framed clothes storage units with some fabric covering it) and space to move around. We had new sheets and towels each day. We could, however, hear the shower of the adjoining bedroom and some noise did come through the walls from our neighbours when they were being a little rowdy, but nothing terrible at all and no more than would be experienced anywhere, really. Yes, there are some stairs from the street into the hotel (I didn't find these particularly steep and was able to carry my heavy suitcase up and down & I'm no body builder) and there's no lift, so for people with mobility issues this might not be the best choice. We didn't have any view from our window, but this didn't matter to us at all. Location: The hotel is a 10 min walk away from central park, which was wonderful. Some posters have commented that to get there you have to walk through a 'project'. There are plenty of routes to get to the park, one of which you walk through some high rised housing, but this didn't bother us at all, we hardly noticed, hardly saw any people least of all those dealing drugs, the part we walked through actually had a children's play area on one side and definitely wasn't intimidating at all. There wasn't even any rubbish around. There would be no reason to feel intimidated, in my opinion. We walked around the area lots at night and always felt very safe.

The night person that works M-F after 12M at the check in desk was a cutie not only was he so helpful in telling me where to go and where not to go, but he actually sat down with me and went over every area of NY with me.

Fortunately we obtained a good deal with hotwire. On approaching the Marrakech Hotel, the exterior signage gives the impression of a rather grand hotel. However, the reality is somewhat different. As soon as you step through the front door you are greeted by a dark steep narrow staircase which leads to the reception area. And this is my main issue with the Marrakech Hotel: it tries to portray itself as being something greater than it actually is. I challenge some of the boasts made on the website: \"newly renovated accommodations\" - our bedroom looked as if it had not had a major refurb for 20 years. \"fantastic location\" - it's not in a fantastic location (compared with, say, Midtown); I would say that it's actually in a not-too-bad location with the convenience of a subway station very close by, giving quick and easy access to many NY tourist destinations. \"Situated near Central Park\" - yes, it is close to Central Park, but be warned, the most direct way to walk to the park (walking east, along W 103rd St) cuts through a housing project area. When we walked through this area, even though it was in the middle of the afternoon, it was very intimidating. I later discovered that this housing project has been notorious for drug dealing. Don't let this put you off staying at the hotel though, since the area around the hotel itself seemed safe enough - just keep to the main roads when walking to Central Park. \"WI-FI, High Speed Internet Access, Free in lobby and lounge\" - yes, there is free Wi-Fi, but take your own laptop, otherwise you'll need to pay 20 cents per minute (12 dollars an hour!) to use the hotel's computer. \"Starbucks Coffee, The world famous coffee shop located at the hotel\" - the wording on the website gave me the impression that there's a dedicated Starbucks IN the hotel; in fact, it's not in the hotel, it's totally separate from the hotel; it's just a normal Starbucks which happens to be next door. Of course this isn't a deal-breaker, but stating that there's a Starbucks AT the hotel could give the misleading impression that this is a hotel with a large luxurious lobby with plenty of facilities, when this is not the case at all. \"Sookk Thai Restaurant: This onsite restaurant... \" - as with Starbucks, this restaurant is NOT part of the hotel, but just happens to be next door to the hotel. \"plush carpeting\" - in our bedroom, while not threadbare, the carpet was most certainly not plush! \"Double / Double Room - Featuring ... coffee maker\" - our room did not have a coffee maker. The best things about this hotel were the closeness to the subway station and the price. The staff were friendly, and they offered to help us carry our cases up the stairs. The bed was comfortable. Apart from the misleading website, the not-so-good things were that our standard double bedroom was small and dark and had a rather jaded appearance. The walls were thin - you could clearly hear people walking or talking in the corridors, for instance. There's no escaping that this is a budget hotel, despite its boutique pretensions.

Another bonus is that the number 1 subway stop is just a couple of steps from the hotel. As for the hotel: we stayed in a room with a 'queen' size bed. I have to warn you that their 'queen' is actually a double-sized bed. The room was small but clean.

There is a subway station right outside the hotel which was fantastic for getting around, it cost us $27 each for a 7 day subway pass which could be used on any line so no need to pay for taxis. We never had to wait any longer than ten minutes between each metro and it took no longer than 15 minutes (at busy times) to travel down to Time Square (42nd street). There is also a 24hr supermarket very close which was rather handy. As for the hotel itself I really don't know what some peope expect for what they pay!! Yeah the hotel rooms are a little on the small side but your in New York all you need it for is sleeping and washing. Our room was cleaned every day with fresh towels always delivered.

People seem to think they've booked 5* accommodation at this price! Here is my breakdown: Access: Yes, there are a long flight of stairs and no lift, BUT there were porters every time to carry my bags and they were very chipper about doing it too. Lovely people and very helpful. Reception: Very pleasant and helpful every time. Advised us on places to go and answered all questions easily. Location: I did hesitate when booking as it seemed a bit out of the way, but it's literally next to 103rd subway. So if you want to walk to Central Park it'll take about 10-15 minutes as it's a few blocks to the east, but better still take the subway 4 stops (10 mins) and you'll be down at Central Park and Columbus Circle, which is a great place to start. Getting the #1 subway takes just 6 stops to Times Square and took about 20 minutes, but equally you can take the #1 to 96th, walk 10ft across the platform and get a #2 or #3, and then it's just one more stop. Even down to Lower East Side (where we spent a lot of time due to the good bars) is only about 11 stops. Taxi from the hotel to Lower East Side took about 25 minutes and cost about $25, which we felt was good value as we were wrecked and it was usually about 2am. Rooms: We booked a twin room with 2 double beds. Bathroom was clean and of ok size. Bedroom still had a fair amount of room considering there were 2 double beds in it. There was a wardrobe that was in the sort of Turkish fabric over a frame type thing with hangers in, and 3 shelves. Not enough room really for 2 people to unpack all their clothes but we made do ok. Beds were changed and made every day, and fresh towels provided too. My only major gripe would be that there is only one mirror - in the bathroom - so getting ready was something of a fight! Bar: By the Reception is a nice bar area which at some times was quite busy, and nicely decorated. They have a happy hour every day with different drinks on offer. We usually took a bottle of wine from the local liquor store to our room and the bar staff always opened it for us and loaned us glasses! So all in all I'd definitely recommend it if you're not completely obssessed with Hilton-class comfort! The corridors are a bit gloomy but the rooms are ok. Our room looked out onto 103rd. I'd definitely go back. I think you get out what you put in and people who turn up with attitude probably get it back. Everyone we met who worked there was pleasant and helpful! In the vicinity are some great cheap eateries. Over the road is The Metro Diner which does every type of food you can think of and is stupidly cheap and has an authentic feel about it. We went there for brunch a few days. Also down the road is Hummus Place, which is self explanatory, but the dinner was incredible!", "Date": "September 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona, Spain", "Title": "\u201cNot recommended\u201d", "Author": "mtonello", "ReviewID": "UR45404981", "Content": "I just spent six weeks travelling around the northeast of the USA...mainly NYC, Boston, Cape Cod and the islands and Connecticut. I stayed in hotels the entire trip. I stayed in this hotel on the final two nights of my trip, prior to returning to Europe. Here are the problems with this hotel, in a nutshell: 1) many websites lead you to believe that this hotel is close to Central Park and convenient. However, it is not. It is up by Columbia University, around 103rd Street. If you take a taxi from the hotel to mid-town (Times Square) it will easily cost you $15.; if you take the subway it will easily take you 45 minutes. 2) there's no elevator! From the minute you arrive at the hotel you must climb a large set of stairs just to reach the lobby and reception. Then, you must climb more sets of stairs to get to your room (in my case, 4 sets of stairs). again, there is NO elevator in the building. 3) this hotel is essentially an old, run-down apartment building that was given a coat of paint, and re-invented as a \"boutique hotel\". be advised: it's dark and gloomy and somewhat creepy. 4) there is no closet in the room. no hangers. no dresser. no drawers. so, that requires that you totally live out of your suitcase (which you have no choice but to leave on the floor, tucked under part of your bed, since the room is so small). 5) the bathroom was the smallest bathroom i've ever been in in my life. 6) there was one small window in my room which looked out onto a brick wall of another building. during the day the room is totally dark due to the closeness of this building - and yet there are only two lamps in the room with a single light bulb in each...so expect dark! 7) there is no internet available in the room. the website for the hotel states Internet Access. Internet Access is only available in the lobby and you must pay for it by the minute. There was always a wait to use one of the computers. 8) the Rates for this hotel are no bargain. you can easily stay in the center of midtown, in a nice hotel, for the same rate, or even less.

We were looking for something affordable but clean and on a good location. The hotel is in the residential part of the upper west side and in close proximity to the Columbia Uni so the \"young\" vibe is all around:) What we found when we arrived is that the hotel is on a perfect location on the metro station of the \"1\" train at the crossing of the103rd and Broadway. The connections to the midtown and any other part of NYC are good as besides the train you have the 104 bus (stops) almost in front of the hotel) which takes you directly through midtown (long Broadway to Times Square than down 42nd str. across 7th through 1st Avenue) to the UN building. The hotel indeed doesn't have an elevator but the few flights of stairs you have to take are not to be intimidated by. The staff is competent and will help you with your luggage at any time. The hotel will hold your luggage in storage after check out while you do your last city buzz before heading off to the airport. The rooms are really tiny but the bed seamed new and it was impeccably clean. We had a flat screen TV a desk& chair & small wardrobe. The best place in the room was the window seat where (if you are an insomniac) early in the morning you can see the Broadway strip waking up. The bathroom was in proportion to the room so you can say it was also pretty tiny but we had no problem with the water (hot water was always available) even though the pluming was a bit loud. For all NCY visitors coming from more serene and quiet places I would recommend the soft ear plugs for a good night sleep because except maybe on the top floor of the Waldorf Astoria there isn't any quiet place in the whole city:) The hotel has no food service but I found out this was more of a blessing than a curse. Few steps to the north of the hotel there is a 24/7 convenient store and a couple of pizza joints and the Starbucks next to the Hotel is open from 5am to 2am (the next day :). There is a pretty descent Thai place also next to the hotel but what I found really good is the Broadway Bagel shop on 99th street (Come by in the morining for the real NY breakfast experience) where for $3 you can get a topped bagel and coffee.

The room itself was very dark (even with all the lights turned on) and was cramped. The bathroom is TINY! I will be including pictures with my review so you can see for yourself. The beds were hard - and I'm usually not picky about beds at all. But this was ridiculous. We would have slept on the floor but there wasn't enough space. The room was so cold, we had to ask for an extra heater. But when I plugged in the heater, the fuse blew, so all the lights went out! Later, when I asked for an iron and board, they sent me an ironing board with holes in it. The iron spewed dirty water on my trousers so I had to wear jeans instead. All this on the first day!

The room on the top floor was quiet and relaxing. Both rooms near the reception and staff areas were extremely noise, with doors from the luggage room slamming non stop, staff talking all night around the reception area, and one night the radiator in my room scared the life out of me, making a noise as though someone was walking on the iron steps outside the room, towards my window. If you do not take a room on the corridor near reception, then your stay will be good. But sadly the incessant noise lost me hours of sleep during my stay on the \"staff corridor\", which is a shame because it really ruined my experience. I am a deep sleeper, so would not like to guess what it would be like for someone who wakes easily. Because the noise came from staff, I can't give them the excellent rating that they otherwise deserve, and this is the same for the value and rooms ratings, which were all otherwise very good. The fact that there is no lift is potentially an issue for some, but they have staff to take your cases up and it did not bother me - I would rather have the long walk and avoid the overnight noises! The location is excellent, with a number 1 subway right at the door, any amount of quality restaurants nearby, a post office and a laundromat around the corner, a short walk across to Central Park and through to the Museum Mile on the East Side. The cocktail bar is very good, with a nice atmosphere and the cocktail waitress knows her menu, and gives service over and above anything I would have expected.

As part of an organised tour I was doing, I didn't have much of a choice. However, there were no bed bugs. I did get a bite on my stomach which stayed there for a few days, but since it was just the one I would probably put that down to something else. Our tour manager explained to us that the style of the hotel meant there were no elevators. I'm a reasonable person so I accepted his explanation but still found the no-elevator thing a real pain. Picture this: It's about 6.30am and it's raining and I'm five foot, weigh 45kilos, and i've got two large suitcases. Nobody was at the door so I attempted to start hauling my bags up the narrow stairs myself. Luckily, an older gentleman- a hotel guest, took pity on me and lugged them up for me. Here's the thing- if you're not going to have elevators at least have plenty of bellhops around. At one point there were about three or four of us all needing our bags to be bought up to our rooms. We all had to patiently wait as the one bellhop catered to each of us, one at a time. Also, I know America is all about the tipping but to have to pay to get my bags bought up- when I could have done it myself if there was an elevator, is kind of annoying. The rooms are fairly nice- I shared a twin. The bathroom was teeny tiny and the walls are paper thin, I could hear it when the people next to us took a shower. The beds were quite comfy and the pillows and sheets were soft. The maids came once a day. The lounge/lobby of the hotel is quite cosy as well, it has a little bar and some comfortable seating arrangements. There are also two computers with internet access, however you have to pay for them. I think it was about .20c a minute and you can pay with cash or credit card. It was the first hotel I had stayed in on my trip that didn't provide free access. The lobby also has a payphone and an ATM, however I found this particular ATM wouldn't let me withdraw more then $100- and this was not a problem with my credit card, as I was able to do it elsewhere. Odd. The cincher for my experience was a few weeks after I got back home and I emailed a friend of mine to jokingly remind her of some money of mine that she had been keeping for me, which we'd both forgotten about, so I never had it returned. I was gobsmacked though when she told me that she had actually given the money to the front desk, to ask them to pass it along to me when I checked out- which I obviously never recieved. It was only $20 but for a poor, travelling student it's a fairly significant amount. Thought it demonstrated poor service that it was never given back to me. All in all, the experience was okay - I was just relieved to not get the bed bugs. The neighbourhood is okay- it has some laundromats, some eateries and it's right next to the subway. Personally, I found it a bit far away from where I wanted to be - near the centre of town. But for anybody wishing to be a non-tourist, it's an okay neighbourhood.

The route takes you through Columbus Circle, Times Square, Madison Square Garden and all the way to Battery Park. Very convenient. 2. Friendly staff. The doormen are always polite, as are the receptionists and chambermaids. They are also willing to have a conversation, making it nice and informal. 3. Comfortable bed. A little on the hard side, but at least you wont be getting back ache! 4. Ten minutes walk from Central Park, and some good food shops nearby. Not so good points; 1. Heating. When we went, the heating was either full on or not at all, and there was no radiator to control it. Instead, we had three heating pipes with pressure outlets on, which make a racket throughout the night. Luckily Im a heavy sleeper. 2. The stairs. The reception is on the first floor, and the rooms go up to the fifth, without a lift. The doormen will help you with your bags, but its not what you need after a long day. 3. Small rooms. Decent storage, and a reasonable bathroom but still cramped for two people. 4. TV. They dont have signal boosters so you get a very grainy picture on every channel. Shame as they use Samsung HDTV's. 5. Location. Has its bad points as well. During the day its nice, but you wouldnt want to get the subway back late at night or walk through the neighbourhood. Very little police as its not a tourist area.

We were going to NTC for a 8 day vacation with my mom, my bestfriend and myself, ready to experience the best of NY. The hotel was perfect; the location is perfect if you want to live central (the subway is right next to the hotel!!) and the customer service was,well, fine. It's not the best choice of hotel if you want to live posh and fancy, but its fine if you have other things to spend money on and if you're not going to spend a lot of time in the hotel room. The rooms ARE small, and yes; it is a little noisy, but we were lucky to be placed in the end of the corridor, so we didnt really have a lot of problems with that. The only thing that i wasnt too happy about was the fact that there is no elevator; a lot of stairs.. On the contraty; the hotel concierges were happy to carry all our luggage up the stairs and all the way to our room. The rooms are small, the bathrooms are extremely small, and the toilettries are not the best quality, but again; just fine. We were 3 people sharing to kingsize beds and that was okay, but if we were 4 people it would be extremely crouded regarding luggage, floor space, bathroom and closet space(which is completely absent from all of the rooms; no closet space). The rooms were tidy and very clean at all times, no worries there. The neighbourhood was great; safe and clean. But again; no matter where you are in NY you can go 3 blocks and you find yourself being in a bad neighbourhood -but thanks to the thousands of yellow cabs swirrling around the city of Manhattan you can get yourself anywhere by hawling a cab at anytime of the day;) All in all; not the most fancy hotel, but a fine hotel with nice people and a cool theme throughout the hotel.

Our beds were a little firm but comfortable. Definitely no bed begs, that is always the first thing I check for. The AC window unit worked great, and we had a flat screen TV. The front desk was helpful and sent us up ice whenever we asked for it, which was great after a long day of walking.

I opted for the Marrakech and immediately wished I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t when I read the reviews and saw the pictures. However, it seems that the hotel has got its act together quite a lot since a lot of these photographs were taken, and you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recognise the place from some of those sordid snaps. Oh, and there were no bedbugs. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find the now-infamous stairs much of a problem except late at night after a day exploring the city on foot. It seems my room was in the furthest corner of the entire hotel, so as long as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in reasonable shape you shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a problem. The location is obviously not central, but the neighbourhood is surprisingly pleasant and there are lots of places nearby to get something to eat (tip: avoid the local McDonalds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nightmare). The subway station is just down the street, and this is a big plus. You will probably go mad from the boredom of communing downtown on the 1 train every day (or twice a day or more in my case) but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small price to pay. That said, the Marrakech is still very much a work in progress. The bathrooms are indeed very small. VERY small. When I sat on the toilet, my knees were touching the far side wall. Furthermore, there was no cabinet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only a small shelf for toiletries about the WC. This meant that if you knocked something off the shelf it would invariably fall straight down the toilet. This happened an alarming amount of times before I hit upon the idea of keeping the lid down on the WC. The air conditioning units are loud, but no louder than any other hotel I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in. I feel for the price you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying, staying in the most vibrant and exciting city in the world and moaning about the size of the bathroom or the air-conditioning unit shows a little lack of perspective. Who goes to New York to spend enough time in their room to be bothered about trivialities like that? I was disappointed in a couple of trivialities myself, though. I would dearly have liked a refrigerator in my room (it was supernaturally hot for a Brit when I went) and a wardrobe (or closet) with a safe in. I was very surprised to be charged $2 on departure for them to hold my luggage for a couple of hours until my flight. Nowhere I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed before, anywhere in the world, has ever done this. The staff were mostly decent, although one young lady was very dismissive and brusque. I had the need to speak at length to one member of staff for advice who was completely rendered insensible by my English accent and was unable to function for about half a minute but was most helpful once I was able to make myself understood. I feel the Marrakech is heading in the right direction. I like the fact that the management seem to read these reviews and take note of the comments. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obviously not the Waldorf-Astoria, and if I could afford to, I would stay elsewhere. But for someone on a modest income who would rather save money to spend in the city itself, you should be more than OK here.

You learn to expect some unique features in such accommodations...sometimes its part of the charm. In the case of the Marrakesh, however, the quirkiness was overwhelming. On our first night, for a cost of over $280, we were required to walk up five flights of narrow stairs, clutching our luggage, to reach a room (#86) without air conditioning and in fact without a closet, a bureau, or any other place to store or hang clothes. There was a ceiling fan and we were fortunate that was enough to be comfortable. When we complained the next morning to the staff, we were placed in a room on the same floor as the lobby bar. It had air conditioning, a bedside table with sufficient drawer space for underwear, and a collapsible wardrobe in which to hang clothes. However, the only sink and mirror was in a lightless corner of the bedroom, which transformed shaving and my wife's application of make-up into an adventure, and we still had to wrestle up and down a narrow staircase with the bags. On the positive side, the location on the rapidly redeveloping upper West Side is incredibly convenient --especially to Columbia University and Lincoln Center--and the front desk personnel are friendly and competent. They are overworked because they double as concierge and registration staff. The lobby bar is attractive, although it would be nice to find coffee somewhere--in the room or in the lobby--before venturing out in the morning. But the renovation of the rooms seems to have been performed without much thought. It was more a case of, \"Let's stick some Ikea-type pieces in this room, and different furniture in that room,\" without focusing on what travellers actually need in even minimal accommodations. It was a good idea to convert what may have been either a delapidated apartment house or rooms for rent by the hour into a boutique hotel for the upper West Side.

Which is why I went ahead and stayed in the Marrakech in Oct 07. I thought the photos looked nic & cool and thought the bad reviews were probably written by disgruntled guests or competitors. I wasn't going to write this, as I thought others would think the same thing. Also don't want to create bad karma. But truth is, it's been weighing on my conscious because it's a health concern and this problem is not something that I would want anyone to deal with unnecessarily, if my writing this could help. (I would never stay there again anyway, by the way, because unfortunately the rooms did not live up to the portrayal on their website. I will not go into those details here though) The bedbugs came home with me and caused me a week or two of hell. I received a crash course in bedbug education. I will share some of it here -- When a place has bedbugs it takes a huge effort and commitment on the part of a hotel to rid the problem, and they may not be able to completely. I do not have much confidence in this hotel's management to be so thorough, based on the other things I saw there. Some rooms may have them and some not. If some guests do not have problems it does not mean the other complaints were invalid. They were lucky to get a room/bed that were not infested. The bedbugs can easily travel to another room if chased out of one. Bedbugs for some reason can bite one person in a bed but not another. They seem to favor females more than males. If you did come home with them, here are examples of what I had to do to control the problem (i.e. you don't want to have to do all this if not necessary!): - put suitcase and everything that traveled with me in my bedroom, sealed the room and set off bug bomb - everything that came with me that could be washed in hot water was washed. - all bed linens and curtains washed in hot water - everything else had to be sealed in plastic bags and cannot be opened for 1-2 years - suitcase straight out to garage where will stay 1-2 years - bought steam cleaner, steamed bed frame, mattress and springs, cracks along edges of bedroom floor (luckily I have hardwood), all bedroom furniture especially cracks & crevices - bought very expensive special covers for mattress, bedsprings, pillows - put on and then sealed zippers w/ duct tape - moved bed so doesn't touch walls or other furniture, put vaseline on legs and placed legs in cups filled w/ mineral oil - treated my pets w/ flea treatment (believed that may help prevent them from harboring bedbugs) I won't go into rationale/ explanations for all above as will be too long, but they can easily be found doing a web search. You can find photos online if you need to compare to see if what you have looks like bedbug bites. Took about 2 weeks for the bites to clear, Luckily now seems to be under control but it was huge effort and I have some of my favorite clothes and other items that are sequestered in plastic bags for another year or 2. Also made visit to ER as I initially didn't know what these bites were, had never had them before. The doctor told me that looked like bedbugs. Also, when you go to a hotel: ask to see room before checking in. Pull off sheets and inspect bare mattress. Should not see any streaks of blood or dark streaks (bug excrement - sorry). Once in a room, just in case leave your suitcase far away from bed. the bugs don't usually travel far from bed where their meals are, so it reduces the chance of them crawling in your suitcase, on a plane, and into your home. To be safe, wash everything you can as soon as you come home and put your suitcase someplace such as a garage if possible. I read bedbugs had been virtually irradicated early in the 1900's with DDT, but as we know DDT was outlawed and there has been a slow comeback of the bedbug. Anyone who travels or lives in an apartment building has to be aware and prepared to prevent and treat this problem.

We tried to Ignore the reviews on here but..........\u201d", "Author": "JoMerritt", "ReviewID": "UR11114760", "Content": "My friend & I arrived, from the UK, at the hotel at 10-45pm and were both exhausted so were desperate for a bed to sleep in! We were a little put off by the 'not so grand' entrance with 2 door men both with walkie talkies. We carried our own bags up the steep, dark stair case & were keeping an open mind (after having read awful reviews on here!). The girl at reception took a look at the pc to check us in, there was obviously a problem & she made up a fib that the pc's were playing up and could we take a seat for a moment! She promptly disappeared! After sitting for about 10-15mins alarm bells starting ringing for us! and we were getting rather annoyed -but whilst we were sitting there a steady stream of guests were coming to reception to complain about everything from heating to the lack of comfort/room in their bed! This didn't look good! Eventually another receptionist came back with the girl that tried to check us in to say that even though we had booked a room with 2 doubles in it, they hadn't got one and could only give us 1 room each -very promptly the two doormen appeared to chaperone us to our 2 separate bedrooms, which I might add were on different floors on completely separate parts of the hotel. My room, 4 flights up the dark horrid stairs, was in the older part & I really wasn't impressed. First night in NYC, never been there before & I wasn't happy to be separated from my friend so went to find her room. It wasn't as bad & had quite obviously been refurbished more recently than my room, the only problem is the heating was on full blast & there was no way of controlling it. We decided to share the one room & one bed in the end - which wasn't satisfactory really. After dropping our bags off we went down for a drink (We needed one desperately after being so disappointed with this hotel) & found 2 English couples who WERE sharing a 2xdouble room- they had been out all day come back to their room & found a couple making love in the bed they had been in the night before & there was no sign of any of their suitcases/clothes etc!!!!! We were horrified! They hadn't even checked out! Lucily we had just vacated one double room so they had at least one bed for the night, but the staff were planning on moving one of the couples to another hotel! Haven't a clue what had happened to their cases though! I have been all round the world and have never seen things like this happening in hotels. After a terrible nights sleep, noisy heating, noisy guests, uncomfortable bed and heating so hot that you felt like you were in the tropics with no ac - we got up extremely early & went down town (one plus point - the subway is just outside! about the only plus point I guess) we went into the thirty-thirty hotel to look at one of their rooms- that made our decision easy - we caught the subway back, went on the internet at The Marrakech and found a good deal on the Holiday Inn, near China Town, promptly checked out and flagged down the first cab! Best thing we did! despite having already paid for this hotel there is no way we could've stayed their another night - it was dismal and horrid and would've ruined our weekend. SO UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY TRYING TO GO TO NYC ON A VERY LOW BUDGET - DON'T GO TO THIS HOTEL!! YES, THE WEBSITE LOOKS FAB AND YOU THINK YOU ARE GOING TO GET SOMETHING REALLY DIFFERENT AND MAYBE A LITTLE UNUSUAL!! UNUSUAL IS DEFINITELY THE WORD! BUT IN A BAD WAY.........Ummm....... Our advice!

It's definitely walking distance to Central Park if you don't mind walking through the projects - not a good idea after dark. You should take a cab or the subway to get to Times Square so that you're feet don't give out on you by the time you get there (about 60 blocks or so). It's obvious that the Marrakech is a past-hostile trying to become a hotel. However, they should make sure that everything is in order before they allow visitors to dish out the kind of money we did. ($269/$389/night) The pictures on their website are definitely deceiving - if you pay attention, they use the same ones of lobby and one obviously redecorated room in several layouts.

After just one stop on the \"One\" you can jump across the line to get the express, the \"2\" or \"3\", (Its right on the other side of the track, usually there when the train stops). However, the \"One\" leaves you at Times Square (A fairly central part of New York), Penn Station (to get the Path to New Jersey), and is the only train to leave you at the South Ferry terminal (to see the Statue of Liberty), so the \"One\" is a rather good train to have within a 60 second walk from the front door. There is a supermarket just in front of the Subway stop, which gave us our cheapish snacks and drinks. All in all, if you are on a budget, its difficult to see a better place to go to.

It appeared to be very reasonable. The website was convincing enough for me. I looked up the reviews and contacted the hotel myself. The price was very reasonable compared to downtown areas. The hotel is located around 101st St, New York's Upper West Side which was fine for me. It wasn't too far from downtown area where I needed to be. About a 17 minute train ride, but New York Subways are awesome, so it worked well. Incidentally, hotel is located across the street. The hotel is undergoing a challenge with breaking down the previous hotels reputation. They are doing their best to make it a first class New York City hotel. Bed was very comfy. Flat screen TV's were great, but hotel room was the tiniest I've stayed in. The hotel has taken great pains to make it memorable. I can't complain about the effort, but the noise was something else. The hotel was a bit noisy for several reasons. Tiny corridors lend themselves to every noise of the guests that are going in/out of the hotel rooms. The noise outside, and the most annoying...the noise from the next room over when someone is in the shower. I had to literally shut the bathroom door which was about 12\" from my head. Once I shut the door, everything was fine. I think at one point, this hotel was set up like a hostel and the hotel was trying to provide private bathrooms, which possibly made for quick construction and no insulation. An \"A\" for effort, but a need for quieter quarters. The bathrooms were extremely clean, had great herbal toiletries, but bathroom mirror was too high for my 5'2\" height, so had to tiptoe to see myself and apply my make up. All in all, was it bad. No! Not at all, it was just some place to sleep. It was geared toward a younger audience who could make it down to the bar and have drinks. For me it worked out beautifully because it was in a potentially terrific neighborhood and it saved me some dough. Keep in mind there is a doorman who is watching out for your safety and announces you in. Peace of mind. Although it's in a good neighborhood, it's like any New York City location. Turn the corner and you're in a questionable area. I personally felt comfortable, as a single female to walk around, have dinner at a nearby restaurant and walk up and down the area at night.

This is not a family place: Loud thumping music abounds from the time you open the door to the quick ascent of the stairs up to the main desk. The dim lighting hides the worn out, faded carpet.

The next night, again around midnight, produced yet again another huge bed bug. This time it was flat. It was hungry. I took it down to the front desk. The young man assured me this was unacceptable.

Everytime I travel I always ask for dble beds meaning 2 beds in the room. I have a son that goes to all my trips with me. I get into NY on the 20th of January late at night get to the hotel and check in. I get the key and when I open the room it has only one bed and very small I go back to the front desk and tell the clerk there must be an error I asked for double he said yes thats what you got... I said well I meant double beds 2 in a room he said \"well mam thats a common misleading on travelocity we always get that error but that room is called a Quad it will be $20 more per night\"..... I said \"ok go ahead and upgrade it.\".. after staring at his computer with a confused lookon his face he stated we had to wait because he wasnt able to upgrade it .His co-worker had todo it.... Here we are sitting there waiting for his co-worker to finish his check in... and we hear him state to this couple that he made a mistake and he is ugrading them from a dbl to a queen at no charge... The couple goes up to the room he then stars counting his drawer knowing that we are infront of him waiting! The couple comes down fast stating they want there money back... after arguing with the customer about giving him the money back infront of all the people waiting there...They finally give him his money back... Finally its my turn. The clerk tells me \"I am sorry for the misunderstanding but Anthony told you wrong its $30 per night not $20\".... (I am already upset of having to wait so long). I told the guy \"I really dont see a reason for you to charge me this amount after having me wait here this long and just upgrading the previous couple at no charge\"... Anthony says \"if you want you can do the same thing they did\"..... Now that just made me sooo mad! I told him to shut up! I had no choice! I thought of my son, It was 10pm and I know nothing about NY, its 33 degrees outside and my son is sleepy! I had no choice but to pay for the upgrade. I made the guy upset enough to send me to the last floor with no elevator and did not call the bell man to help me with my luggage.... I cried with anger that night...and I will NEVER ever go back to that place nor recommend it to anyone not only there customer service is poor but there rooms are so cold you cant control the heat theres only a fan in the room that on a summer night a Lady like me that is only 4'11 will never be able to reach not even getting on a chair. The 2 nights that I stayed they never came in to pick up the dirty towels but yes they did knock on the door to bring more... It's Just a Crappy Place to Stay! Not even while I was leaving... even when the bell man saw me coming down the stairs with my 2 luggages did he help, he just stood there holding the door! Knowing I was struggling with my son and my luggages. The Pictures on there website JAJA they are nice but don't get Fooled by them that's just the Lobby. The rest of the hotel looks like a refurbished housing authority development with creepy hallways and plain rooms No Cable ... No Lights to Dim. Like in there room photos.... Very unpleasent place to sleep you can hear the doors opening and shutting as if it was your room they were opening and closing... Vents made noise all through the night and the view jajaja that great big brick wall was not a pretty site. Gotta Say though. The bathrooms were Super Clean.

But it was the day before my trip I was strapped for cash and needed a GOOD RATE. I arrived 30 minutes early and couldn't check in till 3pm. That was fine. Check in was easy. My room was located on the same floor as the lobby. It was small, but it looked like the rooms on the website except no big screen or flat screen TV. But it did have a desk and full size bed. Well I left and came back 9 hours later or so. When I got back to my room condensation had formed in the room, I don't know how, but there was a fog/mist in my room. EVERYTHING was WETT! The bed linens, the desk, the walls, ceiling, was sweating or either SOAKED! I went to the front desk and they came and checked it out and WERE SHOCKED! They didn't know what was going on. Well they upgraded my room and gave me that night free. The only drawback was it was on the fourth floor and I had stairs to walk up. The other room was bigger and I had a Queen size bed. I had no problems with bed bugs as some reviewers stated or any insects on ANY KIND! I didn't spend a whole lot of time in my room, but I liked it! The staff was VERY NICE to me. I never had anyone disrespect me, ignore me, or get an attitude with me. The bell man were very nice about getting a taxi, opening doors and just for general information about the neighborhood. If you are just looking for a place to just shower, sleep and not spend much time in the room then this is the hotel. I wasn't in my room THAT MUCH, so it was all good. The location of the subway stop IS EXCELLENT!! IT can't be beat not unless you are staying in Times Square. Once you walk out of the hotel the subway is literally 10 seconds MAYBE 15 second away. I'm a woman and I went to NYC by myself, so I was glad of this fact. There are many restaurants around the property and STARBUCKS!!! Also Bank of America has an ATM really close by. I would stay here again if and when I return to NYC. I hate that the hotel doesn't have an elevator, but I can overlook that by minimizing my trips up and down the stairs which I did. Also the hallways weren't the nicest because they are remodeling the hotel. But so what the hallways aren't nice? It's not as if you are sleeping in the hallway. You're there to sleep, bathe and stuff. The lobby is true to form. It looks exactly like that in real time, except for the dim lighting. It won't be dimly lit or have candles lighted when you are there. I had no problems leaving my goodies that I shopped for in my room. I SHOPPED constantly while there and had amassed quite alot. It was never bothered by any of the staff when they were cleaning my room. There appeared to be no heat in the room which was disturbing. I was cold most of the time I was there, except for when I was in the bed. But like I said, I wasn't there much, so no big deal from me. I went to the hotel not expecting much and got sooo much more with GREAT customer service and a staff that was willing to go beyond to help the customers.

We live about 30 minutes out of the city, but planned to have some bevvies, and preferred not to have to drive at the end of the night. That being said, it was hard to justify spending $300 for a night's stay when we were so close to home. I had almost given up on affordable accommodation, when I came across the Marrakech site [a really impressive web site]. I usually check the reviews here before booking a hotel - but truthfully, I was pretty desperate! The room was reasonably priced, and the online reservation system was quick and easy, so a room was booked before I could type t-r-i-p-a-d-v-i-s-o-r. I was worried when I read a lot of what was posted here, though I'm a pretty hearty traveler, and I figured I would give it a shot. I had booked a room with 2 singles. When we arrived two nights later, the lobby was busy, but we were greeted promptly by an attractive, friendly young man. When he looked at our reservation in the \"system\", he noticed that our room had been given away. He stated boldly that they were \"over booked\". He followed that up with, \"We have upgraded you to one of the newer, recently renovated rooms - with one double bed\". Thankfully my friend and I have no qualms sharing a bed - but I guess that could have proved inconvenient / unsatisfactory for other pairs. He also knocked $40 off the rate. We were not prepared to argue, and signed for the room. There are no elevators. I did read that here on someone elses review - so that didn't bother me. The room floors, however, are not very clearly marked [ie, no sign telling you which floor / or direction your room # is] - that was a pain in the butt. We visited 3 floors with our luggage before landing on the right floor. And I do have to say: the hallways to the rooms ----- very, very creepy! The walls are painted electric blue - there are random holes in the walls - dangling, blinking ceiling lights - and trippy tri-color striped carpet .... we laughed - and didn't mind - [as a former backpacker, I've seen it all!] - but I could see how others may feel they were mislead by a swanky web site and lobby. I hope the Marrakech is just slowly \"swanking\" up the whole hotel, one floor at a time! Our room: Very, very nice. An exposed brick wall - a real brick fireplace - a wall mounted flat screen TV - new, high thread count linens - clean, clean bathroom with great toiletries and towels. Very tastefully decorated - very modern. *I cannot speak for the \"older\" rooms that I did not see We had some drinks in the lobby before leaving that night. The female bartender was friendly and down to earth - mixed a mean martini - and the ambience in the lobby / bar area was very \"Moroccan\" .... The door guy flagged down a taxi for us in .5 seconds - and with an impressive flourish. Nice touch!

No guarantee was made, but a comment was added to the record that we'd like early check in if possible. We arrived a couple hours early in NYC for a wedding that afternoon and I called from Penn Station to ask if we could check in at 1pm rather than 3pm. I was told that yes they did have a room ready.

I was a told that there was a computer error, especially with the Internet bookings. Well it was not a computer I was talking to on the phone just 45 minutes before, it was a live female who said come on down a double room is waiting. Then they said they had a room with two beds available at their \"sister property\" just two blocks away. By now we were pressed for time to get to the wedding so we went to look at the other hotel. It was not a hotel, it was a hotel & hostel. A dark, dingy lobby with curtains hung on the walls to hide cracking plaster. The room was decently clean with two beds so we were forced to take it, but It took 15 minutes for them to figure out how to book the room and they took cash only.

This was not our first trip, we have visited and stayed at several hotels before. We booked this hotel which had fairly good reviews and excellent picture on their web site. The location was great, right across the street from a subway stop and close to a small grocery store, coffee and bagel shop, and other essentials. The picture of the lobby was accurate, and that's where it all ended. Knowing many NY hotel rooms are small we booked a room with a double bed and a single. We arrived and were told there were no more rooms like that so we were assigned a double. Hmmm. I showed the manager my internet paperwork indicating we booked a triple, and were paying for such. He apologized and made a copy and assured us that we would get the room we booked the next day, just to bring our things to the desk in the morning to store. OK, we could deal with that since it was so late and we were just going to go to bed anyway. While the lobby looked great the hallways/stairways carpeting and walls were filthy, the walls looked to be falling apart. The room was relatively clean but we soon learned we needed the extra bed to put our suitcases/bags. Our room only had 1 nightstand, a tv stand with a 12 inch tv, no bureau, no closet, and only 2 bath towels, which were stored on the tv stand because there was no place to hang them in the bathroom, and there were no hand towels or wash cloths. We left the next day in hopes that we just had a one room bad luck situation and returned at 5pm. When we asked for a key to our new room we learned we had no room reserved for us at all, and all they could give us was a room with 2 twin beds or a queen. That would have been fine in many other hotels, but not this one. The place was, as my daughter put it, \"so disgusting,\" we decided just to go home. I asked the woman at the desk how it could happen that being first on the list we still didn't get the room we wanted the second time, never mind the first. She said that if they see there are only 2 people on the reservation, regardless of what you want, you will likely get a room for only 2 people, even if you are paying for a room for 3, this so they can fit more people in the hotel. We asked if we could just check out and get our money back for that night, and were first told no - but after complaining about their twice mixing things up we were able to check out and pay just for the one night.", "Date": "June 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cNothing bad to say!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5378591", "Content": "We stayed here in this hotel for 5 nights in mid June 2006. I have to say that I'm a bit amaized about the reviews I found from this site. I found them after we made the booking and I have to say that it definatelly scared me, but... If you have made yours, I can honestly say that no worries. Living in Europe give's me a perspective little bit better if I may say so... this hotel is above average from my point of view from the European hotels this size! The room was not a hell hole as many of you describe, it was small, but we had four of us in the same room and we managed just fine. Lineans were all frech and bathroom was tidy. No bugs, definatelly not! We had to ask more towels and got them right away, staff was very kind and helpful also. Location is exellent, metro is just few steps away. Security staff standing outside the hotel all times, front door locked during night time. I felt safe and comfortable. If you want to complane about the stares, please do try some small hotels in Amsterdam or London or Berlin. I assume that they've had big renovations though, so ofcourse the hotel is now much more better than before. I will suggest this hotel to anyone who wants to spend ones money with something else than Luxorious hotels. City was hot and it was nice to come to the Marrakech and rest and start the next day with a smile on our faces.", "Date": "June 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sandusky, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cI Do Not Recommend This Hotel At All!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5371810", "Content": "The Hotel was NOT what I expected.

When we got to the room some guy in the hallway working on something let us in with his key because that room did not use swip cards. The phone didn't work, The air conditioner didn't have knobs on it. The doorhandle was broke, the bathroom was extremely small. Instead of getting two full size beds they gave us a room with 1 full size bed and 1 set of bunkbeds. This was for 4 adults!!! My husband had to climb up & down 4 flights of stairs twice to complain. They finally gave us the room we saw on the website. It was a little nicer, but when we called room service to get wash clothes they didn't have any. The extra towels we asked for (because there were only 2 towels and 4 of us) were in the dryer. Our toilet clogged twice and we didn't have pillow cases for 2 or 3 of our pillows.

The hotel is also right on the 1 subway line which will take you all the way to south seaport in about 40min. I was told by the manager that renovations should be finished by the end of September. The rates will go up slightly then.

There was no mention on their site about the long narrow staircase you have to climb just to get to the lobby. We came early before it was time to check in so they held our bags for us.

When we got there the guy at the desk said he didn't see our reservation and that the room with two beds that I had booked was not advailable. We ended up getting a double bed and they brought in a folding bed on the 5th floor! More steps!!! The room was so small. The room had a old 17\" tv with no remote control or reception for that matter. The worst I think is the stairs.. We were able to climb them but I couldn't help to think of the people that might book this hotel and not be able to climb all the steps. They should warn you. Also to give up our room even though they had our luggage there is pretty tacky. After reading other reviews it sounds like this isn't uncommen.

Pack your own soap and a spare (ours kept disappearing). Floor of the bathroom (the size of a cupboard) floods and doesn't dry out - no chance of a bath mat. Mattresses not worthy of a dog with fleas. Enough dust, mould and years of grime to give anyone an allergy attack. Ripped greasy carpet, terrible lighting & a bad paint job - it still doesn't cover up the multitide of sins. We ended up stuffing jumpers under the mattress to stop it sagging. No vacum cleaners here - they use brooms!! Very dark, very dim corridors, poorly signed for emergencies. Despite everything, the cleaners were polite. The girls on the front counter have no idea how to use their reservation system. Internet access over priced and unreliable. The only saving grace is that its close to a train station.
