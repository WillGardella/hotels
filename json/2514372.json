The pros are the excellent location in the heart of Midtown Manhatten, just 4 min walk on foot from Grand Central (and the airport transfer busses around- if you don't decide to take an expensive taxi to/from the airports JFK/ La Guardia/ or Newark. You can not only reach the Manhattan sights and shopping areas on foot, but are also well connected to other destinations by the mentioned Grand Central Station. The staff was very friendly and helpful on arrival and depart, the roommaids were excellent as well. Now for the cons: you don't have to be in a hurry when trying to leave the hotel with the elevator. The 6 of them seem always to be very busy, so we often decided to take the staircase (luckily we had a room on the 3rd floor). Don't buy your morning coffee in the bar at the lobby- too expensive though good (did that on the first day), but rather in the small caf\u00e8 on the right hand side when leaving the hotel at the exit/entrance 46th street!

The lobby of the hotel is pretty spectacular, very grand! Check-in took a matter of minutes, all staff friendly and happy to help. The room (on the 3rd floor) was dated and small (Manhattan rooms are typically small) however, the room as very clean! The view looked out onto the hotels roof/services area - a little unimpressed by this. The bed was very big, apparently we booked a 'Cosy queen' however the bed turned out to be a 'Superior king' - very comfortable, with plenty of pillows. The room was fitted out with A/C and or heater - very noisy to say the least, we only used this when we weren't in the room! All facilities in the bathroom worked a treat, all very clean also. The room also came with iron, ironing board, suitcase props and also plenty of space and hangers to hang shirts dresses etc... The room was kept clean everyday by the brilliant maids, all towels were changed everyday without fail, and the bed was always made as if fresh. - Always very friendly when passing in the halls (Goodmorning, Goodevening etc...) The concierge at the hotel seemed to be very helpful, pointed us in the right direction a few times, and gave us information about airport delays and transfer times at different points of the day. The hotel bar was quite expensive, however served a wide selection of beverages including morning Starbucks coffee! (not that we needed them too with the 100's of other Starbucks on every corner!) The hotel Gym - we didn't use however we did have a look and the facilities did look impressive (Small gym with the usual equipment) Food/room services- we didn't bother with either, however prices weren't to bad, food always looked goof also. Checking out- We checked out just before 12pm, again staff very happy to help and wished us a safe flight back to the UK. Gave our bags to the bell hop for safe keeping until our departure time - Bell hop was very snotty at our $10 tip for 2 bags! Door man flagged us a cab back to JFK ($51 + Tips) and we were on our way home. - Overall this was a very nice hotel to stay in. Previously in October I had stayed in the Hilton Garden Inn just off Times Square (Much more modern). Services was always good, except for the last encounter with the bell hop! Room was brilliant, clean and big enough for what we needed it for. Location was excellent also, as are most Mid town hotels boasting the Times Square location. Would defiantly stay here again!

He was so friendly and sweet to our kids and it was such a nice welcome to NYC! We checked in early afternoon and had no problem gettting our room a little earlier than usual check-in time. We drove here in a mini-van, which is a little large for some NYC parking garages, but we were able to get valet parking with no problem. The parking cost $55 a day, but at least they didn't charge more for a larger vehicle and we didn't have to hassle with finding parking on our own. The lobby is beautiful, elegant and inviting. We enjoyed hanging out ther on the comfortable sofas as were coming and going every morning and evening. We reserved a deluxe double double room, which was the largest double room offered, and we were pleasantly surprised with the amount of space we had - plenty of room for two adults and two children. It was very clean and had nice furnishings and bed covers - everything looked new and updated. The bathroom was maybe a little small by today's standards but it worked out fine. The shower was great - good pressure and all four of us were able to shower without running out of hot water. It was unusually warm in NYC for March so we actually used the air conditioning and it worked fine. The beds were comfortable too. The room had a small desk and chair as well as a padded chair and there was plenty of space to walk around the room without bumping into each other. We found the entire staff, from the front desk to the maids, to be very pleasant and accommodating. The location is great, The entrance to Grand Central Station is directly across the street so you can be on the subway in a matter of minutes. We did a lot of walking as well and were amazed by how easy it was to get to Times Square, Empire State Building, Rockefeller Plaza and Central Park on foot. We will definitely stay here again and are looking forward to visiting the rooftop lounge next time. It wasn't open yet but we were told it will be in mid-April. Also, when we checked out, Alfredo was very helpful in directing us on the best way to drive to the American Museum of Natural History from the hotel.

I'm pleased to say, that in part, my apprehensions did not fully come to fruition. As ever I'll start with the positives. The lobby, bar area and all other communal areas of the hotel were immaculate and the 1930s decor was stunning in my opinion, here the hotel is befitting of it's mantra \"the grand old dame\". Clearly the makers of Gossip Girl agreed, they were filming at the hotel during my stay. The food was good too, my steak earned it's $25 price tag I'd say. The maid service was excellent, each day I returned to my room to find my bed made with fresh towels in the bathroom, the cleaning it's self was to high standard with all the debrief from my previous day's exploits in and around Manhattan readily taken care of. The location of the hotel is another positive, if you want to walk or take the Subway most of the key attractions of this great city are within easy reach of the Roosevelt. Now about the room, 852, it was clean, a good size and contained two comfortable double beds. However, it is true to say that there were some noticeable minor aesthetic defects though certainly not enough to warrant any great concern, the bathroom however, whilst being clean and fully functional was in need of refurbishment. Small pockets of mold had developed around the bath with the some of the enamel worn away on the bath it's self. In all the bathroom had a rather dated feel to it though I should stress that this again is no great cause for concern. We are talking minor defects here, similar to those I've encountered in 4 and 5 star hotels. My experience of the hotel bar was over all a little less then satisfactory, service was slow, here I do not blame the bar staff, the fact is on the nights in question there simply wasn't enough staff on to cope with demand. In all certainly not the horror hotel some would have you believe, I enjoyed my stay and would happily return. A solid 3 star hotel that has the potential to strive for better things. If you're thinking of staying at the Roosevelt I have some advice for you. 1) Don't pay $14 per day for Internet access. Every Starbucks and McDonald's in Manhattan provides free wireless Internet access, simply accept the terms and conditions and you're online. There is at least three Starbucks and one McDonald's with two minutes walk of the hotel. 2) If you're a Steak fan you must visit Morton's Steak House, a minutes walk away on the same street (45th Street) Morton's provides probably the best Steak in the world, I cannot describe how good this restaurant is. If you have the cash to spare, it is pricey, you must go. 3) Visit the Highline. The Highline is an old elevated rail road that snakes it's way throughout the lower middle half of Manhattan and beyond. Long since disused it has been converted into public gardens with much of the old rail infrastructure left in place, it truly is a unique, beautiful public space that provides great views of the city and a great place to unwind. Entrance can be found on 23rd Street, and the best part, it's completely free. 4) For breakfast lunch or dinner try the New York Luncheonette, situated on 50th Street close to the junction with 3rd Avenue it's about a five minute walk from the hotel. The locals love it and so will you.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cRoosevelt Hotel NYC\u201d", "Author": "Paula B", "ReviewID": "UR127093666", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel (29Mar 3nights) with my husband and 8 year old son.

There is no atmosphere to this hotel whatsoever so if you are looking for a great American experience don't stay here.

Very handy when I also saw guests carry their own bags to the store room and then watched the bell man count out his stash of money in front of me!!!!

The room looked like it had been recently decorated and was clean. The bed was pretty big and was really comfortable and there was a good sized TV. The temperature in the room was OK and it was easy to control the A/C unit which was a little noisy. The bathroom looked a little old fashioned perhaps but everything functioned OK and was clean. The hairdryer was also a lot better than it looked too. Talking about noise, we were on the 5th floor and you could hear quite a lot of street noise, like beeping etc. The first night I was woken up by really noisy roadworks at 1am (my other half was oblivious to this!) It was really loud, like we were out on the street as well. I had noise reducing headphones with me so just popped them in and was able to get back to sleep fine. There was no reoccurance any other night and we weren't woken up by any other noise. I would perhaps suggest taking earplugs just in case (I had meant to take some for the flight anyway but had forgotten) The housekeeping staff do come round quite early so it is worth remembering to put the do-not-ddisturb sign outside.

I read the reviews and I had very low expectations. Fortunately, my low expectations were exceeded. We initially were booked in a standard queen room. I called to see if we could get an upgrade; they said they were completely booked and an upgrade would not be possible. Upon arrival, we asked for an upgrade again and we got a standard king room on the 12th floor with no view (but no traffic noise). Check-in was fast and the staff was courteous. Our room was smallish but renovated: new carpet, drapes, furniture, paint, bedding and new lampshades. The chair was either new or re-upholstered. The bed was comfortable and the linens were quite lovely. Plenty of pillows. Room temperature was fine. The old heater rattled at low speed but did fine at high speed. The drapes were made out of lightweight material and ballooned out when the heater was on. I found that somewhat disconcerting. The Roosevelt would have done better by installing shades or using a heavier fabric. Safe was easy to program. The clock worked. Flat-screen TV worked fine although the screen had a scratch/missing pixels on it. Room had an iron and ironing board. Desk chair was comfortable. Three lamps gave adequate light. One of the lamps had a light bulb socket hanging out at a cockeyed angle but I was able to fit it back into the holder. The lampshades were not large enough for two of the lamps (the light bulbs were below the shade). The glare of the light bulbs was unpleasant and cast a harsh light in the room\u2014the last thing an older hotel needs. Someone messed up here because I saw the same problem in two other rooms I peeked into. This is a simple fix for the Roosevelt and they need to hop to it. Lighting can make all the difference in a room. The bathroom was very small but adequate. I felt like the cleaning staff did a very good job of cleaning each day. I found the towels to be good quality; we were supplied with fresh, clean towels every day. There was a small ledge above the commode for toiletries. This was an accident waiting to happen and I was glad that I had brought my hanging toiletry kit. Lighting in the bathroom was older but adequate. There was a nice, large mirror and decent hairdryer. Water was not always hot but it stayed warm, and, yes, it was clear water. Commode was set in the floor a little crooked and was not quite securely fastened. This could have been done so much better. There was no active mold but there was some old mold/mildew stains evident around the bathtub. Not such great caulking here. I had room service for breakfast one day and I was extremely pleased. I had two perfectly scrambled eggs, crisp bacon, roasted potatoes with onions and peppers (not greasy!), water, tea (hot!) and orange juice. Service was fast and the food was really delicious. I did not eat in the hotel other than this meal but if this was representative, the Roosevelt can certainly claim to set the standard for room service breakfast\u2014and that\u2019s coming from someone who is very picky about breakfast. I enjoyed the lobby area. Yes, it was busy but it was still pleasant. The doormen and the bellmen all gave very good service. There was a place to print one\u2019s boarding passes and there was even a place to weigh one\u2019s suitcases. I don\u2019t see that very often in hotels.

After they claimed they had no other roons available and agreed to credit our rate by $75, I escalated the issue and another room suddenly became available. The woman who initially checked us in was rude, abrupt and never made eye contact. We found the rest of the staff to be much the same. The bathrooms in these hotel rooms are exactly like a bathroom you would find in a small shared hospital room. Old, dirty, flourescent lights, dingy shower curtain....an absolutely horrible experience. We had a tub issue (draining) on one evening and when I called down to \"guest services\" - no one answered the phone! I then called housekeeping...still no answer. The safe in the room did not work, the staff was generally rude and disinterested, there was no temprature control in the room, no in room movies, some lamps were broken and did not work. Every day, I calmly approached the front desk asking to speak to a manager regarding our concerns and each day, he was not available. The elevators do not work correctly, sometimes skipping entire floors and the vending rooms on each floor smelled like urine (we were on 15). Although the hotel would have masses of people checking in and out, there were only a handful of people at the front desk to manage the flow. The rooms smelled and looked old and dirty, the window units were loud, and the space in a superior room was tiny.

They have made some renovations to the room but the bathroom definitely could use some work as the grout in the tub was covering over moldy previous grouting in a roughshod manner. To be honest all the bathrooms probably need upgrading which would cost thousands and put the room cost up accordingly. We were able to overlook this.

It's well placed on the island (the main reason for us to revisit) and on the surface, it's a 'classy' Art Deco hotel. The rooms are pretty good, 'brown' furniture which befits the style of the hotel, flatscreen TV (usual 'crap' channels though), big walk-in closets, ironing board with iron etc. Despite a 'major overhaul' in the recent past, it's bathrooms are looking a bit shabby (bath needed re-enamalling and the toilet seat was broken etc.) but for the price (via Expedia) you can't complain. Staff are nice, but avoid the guys who stop at nothing to get your dollars by helping you with your bags etc. But you expect that in the larger, 'classier' hotels (or the ones that think they're classy!). Top tips: If you're on a budget or don't like to pay over the odds, DON'T order food or alcohol from the (admittedly pleasant) bar; we're talking $16 dollars for two pints of lager here! Instead, visit a local nearby bar; it's gonna be cheaper! Or, do as we did, head 'round the corner to 'Smileys' store on Fifth Avenue, just across the street from 45th street (opposite Barnes and Noble). They do a vast array of 'six packs' and wines and also have a wonderful 'salad bar' that is a actually a huge choice of hot and cold food; all with an asian twist, that you box up yourself and then take to get weighed ($7.99 per lb). You can eat in (upstairs) or take back to your room! Easy, and much cheaper than the hotel prices. Breakfast: BIGGEST tip here is to go straight to 'Red Flame Diner Coffee Shop' on 67 W 44th St (between 5th Ave & Avenue Of The Americas) - look it up on Yelp.com. We were actually recommended to go there by the (cute!) Roosevelt doorman; he uses it, it's a New Yorkers' place to eat! The food is AMAZING, the service wonderful and with NONE of the attitude at Carnegie Deli (seriously, why do tourists STILL go there?!). It's been 'done up' in recent years and is so clean and bright, you might want to eat there for evening meal as well! You can get a hearty breakfast for two with unlimited coffee etc. for under twenty bucks; yep you read right, twenty!

Overall it was so-so, acceptable and certainly not the best or the worst I've experienced.

The lobby, doorways, elevators and some floors were almost always overrun with loud gaggles of shrieking teenagers and middle-aged men wearing \"Hi, my name is Bob\" nametags. More than once I had to weave my way through piles of luggage and overweight middle school chaperones waiting for their busses back to JFK. That's all fine but if you are looking for someplace relaxing, this isn't it. The crowds made it difficult to get an elevator and there was almost always a loud conversation outside my door. Cleanliness was so-so, the place was far from spotless, and while the towels were clean, fluffy and plentiful the first day they were apparently rationed on subsequent days. As someone mentioned in a previous review the toiletries weren't replaced either. There are no coffee makers or refigerators either and while there was an in-room safe it was inoperable. The location is ok but I'd rather be farther away from TouristTown in Times Square.

We also saw a sign were the service desk promoted they could help you with tickets to the 9/11 memorial.

The woman at the desk assured that this was the only way and I asked specifically if there was any place downtown where I could print the tickets, and she said no. I found this strange and went back to my room and googled up that there actually would be a place to print the tickets, close to wall street. We booked the tickets, went to this place which belonged to the memorial, printed the tickets in 2 minutes and went to this amazing place. I mean, it was the simplest thing on earth and if we hadn't been leaving the same day I would go back to confront the woman at the desk.

We stayed overnight at the Premier Inn Manchester Airport which was a great hotel. Flight was good, in flight entertainment was great - over 50 films in the library of which about 13 were new releases. We had decided to go native and tackle travelling into Manhattan by public transport. I had read previous reviews and thought we\u2019d give it a go. We took the Airtrain from the terminal to Newark Airport train station - that was painless. Just followed the signs for the Airtain. Bought a ticket from the machine which always has helpful staff standing around to help. Costs $12.50 to Manhattan. The train station is at the end of the track and tells you on the tannoy when you have arrived so you don\u2019t need to get off until the end of the line which is only about 5 mins. At the train station the train leaves from track ??? but again , theres helpful staff on the platform who will direct you. We had just missed the train so had to wait for 30mins for the next one. The train from the airport takes you in New York Penn Station as had a couple of stops in between stops at Newark Penn and Seacuaus before it arrives at New York Penn Station. I was a bit overwhelmed when I got to NY Penn as didn\u2019t have a clue what to do then. I knew I had to take the subway but didn;t know which one and there was no staff I could see to help me as it was mobbed. A helpful New Yorker assisted me and once I knew what to do it was very easy. So when you get to NY Peen head for the subway. You need to take the Uptown subway which was No 1 Subway get off after one stop and then head for the S subway ( silver line ) this takes you into Grand Central. If your planning how long all this will take, it was about a 30 mins train ride from Newark and less that 5 mins on the subway. You\u2019ll need to buy a single ride ticket for the subway which was $2.50 each and you can use it for your journey for both stations. Again when getting to Grand Central we didn\u2019t have a clue which exit to take to get to East 45th St so we headed for the nearest exit and came out on E 42nd St and just walked the few minutes to the hotel. Days later we realised we should have taken the Vanderbilt Avenue exit from the main terminal. If I was to do it again, I would have printed of a subway map and NY street map before I arrived, as when we came out on E 42nd St we were like well which way down we go now. The Hotel The hotel was breathtaking when entering, very NY 1920\u2019s so glamourous. This is why I had chosen this hotel, a wedding was taking place and it nearly brought tears to my eyes. The bride looked beautiful and it added even more glamour. Check in was about 20mins and I had to leave a $100 deposit in cash as I hadn\u2019t brought my credit card with me. The room was prefect. The bed was huge - we had a superior king size. Nice plasma TV with lots of channels such as HBO, FX etc. I knew that the rooms didn\u2019t have coffee making facilities, so heading down to the lobby to grab a coffee when I woke up early after my first nights sleep. It was 5am and I could not get a coffee. The concierge advised me I could walk up to 5th Ave to get one. However I walked straight across E 45th a block and a half ( walking to the right towards 5th when and found a 24 hr deli and grabbed a coffee there and brought it back to the hotel lobby. The Cosi Cafe across the street opens at 6.30am and a grande americano costs $2.38 as opposed to $5 in the hotel. This was to be a pain for the rest of my stay as I was always up before the coffee stand / cafes opened and had to head out every morning. Our room was on the 4th floor and outside our window was the generators, you could her them but it didn\u2019t disturb us too much, but I would ask for a higher floor if I stayed again. I paid the $15 each day for wi-fi and noticed later that the $15 dollars was for each appliance not the room , so my daughter had her iphone, ipad and I had my laptop so we had three applicancies. We didn;t realize until check out which I was not happy about. No even free wi-fi in reception. They have a business centre located on the second floor but I used the Web Zone located in the lobby, they have two computers (located next to the Roosevelt Grill) they have two pc\u2019s and a printer , its free to print off your boarding passes, I needed to print off my Broadway tickets and had to use pay as you go, you have to swipe your credit / debit card. I used it for about 4 mins and was charged about $4. We had room service on a few nights very fast delivery within 15 mins, ordered the pizza and a selection of cup cakes was $42 with delivery and service charge and so tasty and plenty for two. Also recommend to Chicken BLT was the best I have ever tasted. Also got take out from Fung Shui in Grand Central - was yummy. Tours We purchased all our tickets before we left the UK using Vaitor.com. I have used this website in the past in Miami and Orlando so knew they were a reputable company. We booked the Hop on Bus on our first day theres 3 loops downtown Downtown Loop , Greenwich Village, Times Square, Empire State Building, Flatiron building, Union Square, Soho, Chinatown, Little Italy, Lower East Side, East Village, Rockefeller Center takes about 2hrs and operates daily from 8:30am - 5:00pm. The bus stops at all the tourist attractions so its really easy to get around and they go every 15 minutes so you never have to wait too long. We decided to do the Brooklyn Loop to visit a different borough and see what it was like. Was disappointed that this was not a hop on / off tour had to stay on the bus for 90 mins. We wanted to walk back to Manhattan from Brooklyn on the Brooklyn Bridge , so this wasn\u2019t possible. Natural History Museum pre booked via Viator and just went straight to exchange desk, queues for on the day was very long it was a |Bank Holiday in USA ( presidents day ). Lots of families and children there . We booked the Water Taxi hop on off tour with 911 Memorial tour, the water taxi was excellent. Left from Pier 84 12th and W 44th St easy to find. Great views of both the Manhattan skyline, Brooklyn, Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island and New Jersey. You can hop off at Battery Park ( for 911 Memorial ), South Seaport & Brooklyn. The memorial was very moving and the reflecting pools are beautiful. Security is very tight ( similar to going through airport security ). If you have time we didn\u2019t the battleship USS Intrepid is docked next to Pier 84 huge ship which is now a museum. You get a discount if you have booked the water taxi and tickets are only $14 each. We did the Sex and the City Tour which was great fun, our guide Ashley was great she\u2019s a stand up comic and actor also and she was very entertaining. We were picked up at the P|ultizer Fountain in front of the Plaza on 5th Avenue and boarded the bus. She showed us all the sights featured in the show and the films. We stopped at the Pleasure Chest, Magnolia Bakery and Aidan and Steve\u2019s bar. We had free cupcakes and discounted Cosmo\u2019s. We got to see lots of the city such as the West Village. This was a great value tour lasting about 3 hours and again booked with Viator. Central Park We wandered through Central Park starting at Strawberry Fields past the Bow Bridge onto the lake and the Boathouse and followed the road down through the Zoo to the Woolman Rink , we had planned to Ice Skate but we were too tired and weary. I would love to Central Park in the summer with all its greenery. Shopping Macys - huge store loved the old wooden escalators in the older part of the building, head to the 8th floor for the bargains. I bought a Michael Kors winter coat for $90 should have been $285. Century 21 @ Ground Zero far better than Macy\u2019s some greats bargains Raybans $69, Ralph Lauren PJ\u2019s $20, and much more in my basket. We also loved Cart and Barrel which is on Madison Ave just behind the Apple Store and FAO Shwarz on 5th. My daughter had saved some money to buy a necklace at Tiffanys and it felt such a special occasion, its a beautiful store and it was lovely to see the couples getting engaged sitting down drinking champagne whilst the Tiffanys staff helped them choose the perfect ring. Times Square ( 5 mins walk ) is eye opening , you have to see it to believe it, its awesome. 1000\u2019s of people there in the evening. The billboards provide so much light that it feels like day times during the night. A great buzz going on in Times Square. Broadway We saw Phantom of the Opera whilst we were there, I purchased my tickets before I left the UK , I signed up to Broadway Box web site about 2 weeks before my trip to NYC and received emails for offers each day. I managed to get Phantom of the Opera tickets for $40 each. Paid on line and my tickets were emailed to me. We had rear right mezzanine seats and they were great. I knew we would be at the back of the theatre but didn\u2019t hinder the sound or view. The show its self was amazing, the scene changes, actors and performance blew me away. Majestic Theatre was small and beautiful , very easy to find just off Times Square. We had a great evening. Back to Newark On our last day we walked past a bus stop 42nd St that had a sign that said Newark Airport transfers $16 runs every 15 mins. So rather than tackle the subway with our cases, we decided to get the bus. Painless and relaxing . The stop is near the corner of 5th and 42nd St opposite the New York Public Library. Short walk with our cases from the hotel waited for about 15mins hopped on the bus arrived at the terminal 45 mins later. Really wish I knew this for out journey into Manhattan.

I decided it would be best to stay away from the floor, for fear of having his twin brother race over my feet and up my leg, which would have cause somewhat of a panic, so i sat on the bed. As i lay back, what crossed my line of sight but a more adventurous roach that had decided to crawl up the wall and was mincing around in the corner above my head ! My partner with his recently stripped tittle suggested that this was his opportunity to regain some of his lost masculinity. \"PHAH !\" I exclaimed , grabbing the glass and postcard from his hand and balancing on the bed. In one swift swoop i had captured \"Rocky the Roach\" and chucked him into the ice bucket, at that moment the maintenance man turned up and i proudly presented him with my catch of the day.

I went straight to the computer to email some documents that needed to be sent, to find we have to pay for Internet?

My partner was getting quite irate at this point and went back to reception to demand for the manager who surprise surprise received our email and printed the confirmation straight away. We then overheard them telling another hotel guest they did not have email and directed him to the cronky old printer, needless to stay my partner intervened! I think the bottom line is If you are looking for somewhere to just crash at night and you aren't going to be spending too much time in the room then it's fine but if you want luxury then it doesnt live up to its 4* status.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cPhenomenal ambience & experience\u201d", "Author": "Monica M", "ReviewID": "UR124984026", "Content": "Decided to spend a day in the city, visit the museum - enjoy the city for a change instead of rushing back home.

The room was facing a road and i heard the trash men every morning, along with traffic. As i,m a light sleeper this disdurbed me every morning, but hey ho, we were in the city that never sleeps! Very clean, quick check at the bed revealed no evidence of bed bugs. Lovely fluffy towels which were replaced daily, air con, perfect, heating perfect, tv, only one channel which was too blurred to watch, but i wasnt in the room long enough to watch it. Only gripe was that the room safe did not work. I went to reception and was told that i had to be in the room for it to be rectified. As i wasnt in the room long enough i didnt bother as i placed my passport, ect, in my friends room safe. We didnt eat in the hotel but saw some of the meals which looked nice. We had a few cocktails in the bar which werent cheap $14, but they were a good size and boy did they have a kick! Watch out for the surcharge which is added, it can really bump the bill up.

They rooms were dated, but we didn't care - were only there to sleep. Beds and pillows were comfortable! The Hotel lobby was beautiful. From the minute we arrived, we were taken care of. The bellman took our luggage and met us in the lobby where we checked in. We arrived 2 hours early so they held our luggage for us so that we could go ahead and do touristy things. Our room was on the 5th floor. We did not have much of a view nor did we hear any street noise. There is a Wells Fargo right down the road in case you need to go to an ATM. Also, go out the back door of the hotel and walk 2 blocks toward Times Square - we had breakfast at Food World (convenience store)/Dunkin Donuts every morning. This worked out great as we were on our way to Times Square to catch the Grayline Tour Bus, which I also highly recommend. One night when we returned to the hotel, we had no clean towels. No problem though as there was a maid on our floor who gave us towels. The only complaint that I have is that when I went to check out I was greeted with a $30 breakfast charge, which I did not incur. I disputed the charge and the lady just looked at me. I expected her to push buttons to remove the charge, but she did not. Finally, after standing there and staring at her for a bit, I requested an itemized receipt of charges to my room. She seemed annoyed, but eventually gave me the printout. When we left, we were going to take a cab back to LGA, but the hotel had its own car that was $35 flat rate to LaGuardia.

The room could use some minor refurbishing, but it was adequate. It did have some peeling paint in the bathroom and the carpet was a little shabby. Had a 32\" flat screen TV.

There was some traffic noise on the 8th floor, but it was not too annoying; our room was not on main street though. It was very cold (low 20's F) & windy for 2 days, and the room heater struggled somewhat to keep that part of the room warm enough. We did not eat at the restaurant in the hotel.

The police and ambulance sirens, cars and taxis but this is the result of being in the heart of the city.

The room was medium sized but on the second day we had to move as the TV was crap and was very noisy you can hear car noise its so loud, we went to the 12th floor which was not as noisy but again the door has a large gap at the bottom and you hear all the doors slam and next door the rooms are very dated and worn, the only good thing in the room is the bed. Do not eat there as its very expensive at $26 dollars for a buffet breakfast to which you have to tip on top. New York is very very expensive but has some wonderful sights to see, so not all bad.

It was our second day of our holiday as we came for my girlfriends 21st birthday and I also planned on proposing whilst we were in NYC too and the holiday was going brilliantly. We went on a day trip to woodbury common and came back to find that someone had entered our room with a un-named key card and also tampered with our key coded safe and stole the remaining money we had left in there securely along with a mobile phone and the engagement ring for my girlfriend. The thieves took the money but left the mobile phone and the engagement ring inside the safe which to me if this was an ordinary thief I would imagine he would have taken the lot??? Anyway we contacted Security and also the NYPD. The hotel told us that they could not do anything and that they would have to go through insurance but we would 100% get our money back. We had to get money wired over which put us in debt when we got home and we ended up waiting months and constant calls and emails from england to New York continued until we got some answers. Finally the Insurance company emailed us and told us the hotel was not liable for \"loss\" and we received absolutely nothing. This was truly the worse time for me and my fiancee. This hotel cost us so much money and in no way was it helpful at all. I tried to contact them but they would just ignore my emails, everytime I called no one was there. What should have been a dream holiday and 21st birthday for my girlfriend turned into a nightmare she still gets upset about to this day. It took me to start writing about this incident on there social network sites for them to contact me and there sales and marketing director gave us a little glimpse of hope for about a week and ADMITTED that the hotel had let us down and he would do everything he can only for him to shut us down again and tell us they would not help us any further. My advice to anyone who is going to NYC which is a fantastic city, is to avoid this hotel because it stinks of dishonesty, its staff lack integrity and in a city where dreams are made... this hotel destroyed ours with an insurance scam.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Cod, MA", "Title": "\u201cThe Roosevel Hotel shows its age of 84 years\u201d", "Author": "firedawgs", "ReviewID": "UR122681611", "Content": "Customer service was helpful in accommodating a double booking of the same room that hotels.com did.

Although, the art deco of the 20's was fabulous for me to see. Nothing great for my son. The rooms were average in quality, but needs some major updating from rust spots to decor. The regular King or double room is way to small; which my sister rented. I was bumped up to a deluxe double which gives you approximately 5' more which I think should be the minimum. The location is in good spot, being 2 blocks to Grand Central Station, and 4 blocks to Time Square. Waiting 2 days before arriving in NYC was a benefit, due to the lower of the prices to book out rooms. Valet parking is $50 a day, but worth the $10 more of self parking; which you would have to find it yourself. The valet service is a third party service, and upon bringing my vehicle back, I noticed that they scratched my new car in two spots.

We were also told other guests had had issues with this policy. We had one family with a 4 and 10 year old staying in a double room with their parents; which cost $20 more than the king room. The children were not included in the free breakfast, they had to pay an extra $14/child, and this adds up! So each day cost the family with small children an extra $48/night. Every other hotel we looked at, children ate free if they stayed in same room as parent. In the end, the hotel allowed the children to eat free on one day and because not all our family members from the 3 other rooms had breakfast we applied their coupons to the kids meals.

The room itself looked tired. Not all the lamps worked and we had to call the front desk to get one replaced as the room was very dark (very fast response).

They are clean , hot showers, clean towels, simple and do the job. The location is noisy at times (like any central city hotel i imagine), but in Manhattan location is precious and it is a small price to pay! The lobby is beautiful, vintage, very clean and very 1920s! Infact the hotel is very well kept! The hotel is well located for more or less everything, I mean, Manhattan is a lot of walking anyway if you plan to do it by foot, but the hotel is literally 5 blocks from times square (out of the hotel, turn right and follow 45th! street) and 1 block from Grand Central Station!.. which if by the way you are flying into JFK or Newark you can get a shuttle bus for $15 each way per person. Taxis cost approximately $70 + tips!.. The concierges are very helpful and friendly and can advise you on all of these things! On saying that they are a great way to see the city, and stare out the window as you spend plenty of time in traffic in the midst of Manhattans one way grid system. Its worth noting that unless you are a New Yorker, the subway is a relatively hard thing to work out! Walking is fine, and I would imagine the city would be fine for the immobile and wheelchair users too. :) Buy a New York pass before you go.. i think it was $150 dollars.. but it is entrance to literally all the huge tourist attractions (Liberty Island, Ellis Island, Empire State, Madame Tussauds, Rockerfeller Centre, NYC Water Ferry etc etc!!) I seem to remember the Empire State Building being around $50 alone! Rockerfeller Centre was my favourite view!! The views to the North over Central Park are breathtaking.

Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again, especially once the room renovations are completed.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGo Elsewhere\u201d", "Author": "zozika1", "ReviewID": "UR120841467", "Content": "I have stayed in many NYC hotels before, this was the lowest point thus far. We were there for a one-day Continuing Medical Education workshop, which I directed for 70 participants, our staff included 5. We stayed 2 nights, one night each before and after our one-day CME program. When I first walked in we received the first dose of \"hospitality\". The check-in area is behind what seems to be a gate like arrangement with 2 Concierge desks on opposite end of the hallway, narrowing it down some. Since I did not see the check-in, I walked up with my luggage to one of the concierge guys, who obviously had to see me, but kept looking down on some paperwork. I was just standing, hoping at some point, when he finishes looking at whatever paperwork he had to be reviewing right that moment, he will help me. Several awkward minutes went by and I certainly did not feel like it was me who should be addressing me. The other concierge guy on the opposite side saw this and eventually addressed our down-looking chap, after which he looked up and reluctantly advised me that the check-in was right behind him. They gave us a conference room for the CME program right next to another conference room used for Church of Christ activities, which I respect, but they were so loudly singing that it interfered with our program. The hotel rooms are small and provide some old unhealthy moldy atmosphere, but all that I would have easily forgotten as \"expected\". What caused me to actually write is the incredibly poor service and downright rude way staff handles guests. Trust me, it was not just one bad apple or random experience. We had at least a handful of encounters where hotel staff certainly were not nice, to say the least. Probably the most egregious instance was before checkout. I was asked by a friend (who lives in the area) to unofficially examine his mom. This took a bit longer than expected, just on the morning of our checkout day. So at 11 AM (with a 12PM checkout time coming up) I called down and asked for a \"late checkout\", which is standard and pretty much all hotels I have been to had it (it may be anywhere between 1/2 hour to 2 hours). When I politely asked \"if\" we could have late checkout, this b*tch just bluntly announced straightforward that \"NO\" and that I would be charged $75 if I did not get there by 12. Excuse me?? I explained that I am a doctor and had to examine this patient for why we are running a bit behind. That didn't touch her. She kept addressing me with an emphasis on MISTER (despite the fact I had just mentioned I was a doctor, plus it was \"Dr.\" how my name was registered) and when I asked her to perhaps not keep addressing me Mr. and kindly use Dr. if possible, she snapped out in a highly irritated tone that she would not do that and asked if I was a man and if so she was going to call me Mr. We rushed and managed to make it down by 12.15 PM and (I believe) we were not charged $75... Besides this particular incidence, throughout pretty much our entire stay, every time I called operator from my hotel room, a rather unfriendly (to b*tchy) deep voiced female asked in a tone that made you feel like you should not have called and bothered her. That is unusual. I would say that the standard/usual is that when you call the operator from your hotel room, some kind and warm voice greets you in a grateful tone. Here we had the diametric opposite. The transportation was a nightmare. They won't get you car service or cab when you call the operator, but they advise that you just go to the front door and there will be cabs there. No. There are never cabs there and each time we wanted to get anywhere, it was either a 15 min waiting in front of the hotel waiting for cabs or we went to the nearby Madison Ave and got cabs on our own. The worst was when we were leaving for home and were already waiting for 15 min with no luck (we had a train from Penn to catch), with my GF standing on the corner of 45th & Madison trying to get a cab, while I am waiting for the hotel guy to find one. He waves that there is one, I wave to my GF to come (and she came relenting her post and carrying her luggage back), but then it turned out somebody else took the cab and we were back to square one. Eventually we ourselves got a cab off Madison, after one that stopped refused to take us due to the too short distance. Therefore, it is far to say the hotel provides you zero assistance with cabs. There were several other less noteworthy instances when service was sub par. You could feel that they were so busy due the good location they absolutely did not care that you would just not ever go back there (like us), because they would have plenty of business with or without you. Well, I actually brought quite a bit of business there, which I am happy to take somewhere else next time we have a CME program. The location is great, just as others reported, but with such an attitude, small moldy rooms, and frankly poor service I most definitely recommend you go somewhere else.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201ctop class,location, location!\u201d", "Author": "aloha40", "ReviewID": "UR120770101", "Content": "My teenage daughters and I stayed at this hotel in Oct 2009 for a 1 day girlie trip in New York City...

So I really got to see the hotel, the staff, the facilities etc. I really really liked it! Before going, I read some reviews on this page and got terrified! Bed bugs, dirty rooms, horrible staff, nightmare-bathrooms... BUT this wasn't my expierence at all, luckily! Maybe it has to do with the rooms you get... The room I stayed in was for 4 people, two king sized beds. It wasn't big, but it wasn't tiny either. It was really ok, considering that I don't need to run up and down in any hotel room! After all, it's New York!! You don't spend so much time in the hotel room, you walk the city! The room was clean and room-service changed sheets, towels and waste-bags every day. There was always toilet paper in the bathroom. Always hot water, had some difficulties with the stationary shower, but after the second shower I just got used to it! And it was fun! NO BED BUGS, at least not in my room, or in any other my 20 friends stayed in. We couldn't open the window, but the A/C was working and was not noisy at all. There was no way to get fresh air in the room, but it didn't smell bad or mouldy. And after all, we were 4 people in there! The great thing was the bed. Honestly, I slept sooooo well, they were so comfortable and huge, I didn't want to get up :) The hotel staff was really ok as well. They did their job just fine, noone was rude to me and noone damanded a tip. When we checked out, we still had a few hours left until departing. The staff demanded 1$ per luggage to store our stuff, which was really ok and not too much. When our bus arrived to take us to the airport, the bus driver refused to put our luggage into the bus, saying he didn't got paid to do that! The hotel staff helped us and carried all our luggage and stored it into the bus, which was really great help because we were a group over 30 people! Thanks about that :) The hotel lobby is huge and impressive. The vending machines all worked perfectly, never had any problems. Would've liked it though if I'd have a fridge in the room to put my own stuff in it, more cosy! The location is terrific! Just everything is closeby, Time Square, Broadway, Rockefeller Center, Empire State, Central Park, Fifth Avenue, Grand Central Terminal, which is just wonderful. You get the chance to walk the streets and feel like a real New Yorker!! All in all, I had a more than pleasant stay at the Roosevelt. My biggest issue was the cleanliness, and there was nothing to complain about that whatsoever! Sure its old, yes there are no slippers or robes, but hey people...it's not your home! It's a hotel!!! At really reasonable prices and with nice services! There is only one more thing left to say, oh New York I love you!

It was clean, the staff were friendly and helpful (from the concierge through to the housekeeping staff) and attention to detail is considered. This ranges from practical considerations such a computer area for guests to print return boarding passes through to touches which are more aesthetic (flowers arrangements changed regularly) The lobby itself is not just a place that guests might simply pass through but a sumptious area to actually spend time in. Our room was spacious, clean and well appointed as was the storage space and the bathroom. There is no doubt that this hotel would be hard to beat for location, you simply trip over all the iconic New York sights as soon as leave the hotels doorstep; Chrysler building, Empire State (visible from bedroom window) Central Park, 5th Avenue, Times Square, The Rockafeller Centre and Grand Central Station to name a few!

I booked the the room via Priceline so I did not know the name of the hotel until after I had already paid. When I saw the some of the reviews on TA, I became concerned that my anniversary trip would not live up to my expectations. I was pleasantly surprised, upon check in I mentioned to the clerk that it was my anniversary and I was upgraded to a superior room with a king size bed. The room was very nice and while not the most spacious it was ample enough especially by NYC standards. I found all the hotel staff to be courteous and very helpfull. I was never felt pressured to give a tip (our european friends should know that tipping is a custom in the US for a good well done and that hotel and restaurant staff are paid a very low hourly wage and that tips make up a large part of their income). We enjoyed the lobby bar, the roof top lounge and the restaurant. Our room was cleaned everyday and while the furnishings were of a more traditional style (fitting the overall decor of the hotel) they were not run down or in disrepair. Upon arrival the AC did not appear to be cooling too well and the maintenance staff responded within minutes and resolved the issue. When I tried to give the maintenance man a gratuity, he refused to accept it saying it was part of his job. The bed was very confortable and NO BED BUGS. Did not find street noise to be a problem. The location was perfect, close to everything and many great places to eat and drink all close by. The subway and Grand Central station within a short walk. The hotel is very busy and there were always lots of people milling around in the lobby, then again the hotel has over 1000 rooms and when you have that many rooms there's going to be a lot a people. I never had to wait more than a few minutes for an elevator or to speak to someone at the front desk.

Don't go booking the biggest bed you can and then complain about it! 2) the decor... When I went, the decor was what some people would call dated. I call it a beautiful period property. Sure, some things like the bathroom suites needed updating, but it was clean and functioning. 3) the noise... errm, hello? you do realise you booked a trip to New York right?

The mangement have responded that they are in the process of updating rooms, the reception staff informed us ours had been (paint and carpet) hard to believe given the state of the room but the inside of the closet did smell of fresh paint.

The two things I liked the most are: the comfortable bed and the lemon soaps in the bathroom. I understand why the airlines contract with this hotel; the rooms are quiet and can be darkened, the location is very good with quick access to the airports.

Checking in was simply Abysmal - the very first room we were given had a heavy smell of mould, my wife took two sniffs in the room and then we went back to reception to complain. Fair enough (but suspiciously without quibble or complaint) we were \"upgraded\" to a room on Madison Avenue. So off we trotted up to the room, and guess what.................. the key card didn't work . So two more trips up and down to the lobby later, we find the twice changed key still doesn't work. Quite helpfully, a member of staff on our floor sees us in distress and comes over to help. He tries at least three times to open the door before it finally works, ( guess we weren't sliding the key car in and out within the requisite 0.006seconds that was required to open up our personal \"Fort Knoxx\"). By now we are both tired, thoroughly fed up and cheesed off. We rough it for the remaining three days trying our best to enjoy the city whilst avoiding our \"hell hole\" hotel room. Did I mention mould? Well funnily enough, our new upgraded suite didn't smell like mould............. at first, i guess it was taking its time to mature, but by the time we left, in addition to a loose and shaky tap faucet, our microbial friends had started their own little black mould colony on the bathroom walls. See attached photos. So in conclusion, despite the lovely pictures on their website and the quite impressive lobby, this hotel quite deserve 3 and a half stars. in fact no stars would be appropriate. The front desk staff were neither warm, friendly or appeared particularly interested. In fact so aloof was the receptionist that felt the privilege to stay at this hotel was all mine. And if it all wasn't so bad, The Roosevelt hotel kindly gave us one last parting gift. Having settled our bill in full and in cash, our dear friends in the accounts department not only billed my credit card, but billed me for more money than i owed. Quite helpfully, they billed nearly 1 1/2 times the amount my total bill. This \"gift\" I didn't get until I attempted to use my credit card on my return home to find that they had not only maxed out my overdraft (without reason) but that a ten day hold on my card prevented me from accessing my account until I, yes i did say I, had to call New York to ask them what the hell they were playing at.

The guy at the front reception remembered us when we checked out and he apologized for not being able to check us in before 3pm when we arrived! if that's not good customer service, I don't know what is?!?

I wasn't at all worried about this as the letter said we would have minimum disruption.

Grand Central Station is less than 5mins away. 5th avenue and Central Park are within an easy walking distance. On our first day we woke up (After a very good night's sleep) and walked from the hotel to the Staten Island Ferry. Im so glad we didnt take the subway and the weather was perfect - you see so much when you walk; we saw the Flat Iron building, and many scenes from movies. Its like being in a movie!. We did take the subway back as our feet were tired after all the walking. We were on the 18th floor and wow the bed was huge!. The space of the room was great and decent wardrobe space for all my dresses!!. The bathroom was good with a decent shower. The fittings were very characteristic for the hotel (Character was one of the reasons for me that I picked this hotel). The room was very clean throughout our stay which was lovely to return after a full days sightseeing. The minute we arrived there was a few friendly gentlemen by the entrance in the street asking if we needed a hand with the bags wearing top hats and tails. Again for me the wow factor!. You are greeted with marble stairs, beautiful flower arrangements and an incredible reception with comfy sofas. It's beautiful. The staff allways greeted us with smiles (i loved their customer service). The hotel food was great, we both had New York steaks and wow it was incredible.

As for New York it was my second visit, and I was disappointed by the general lack of manners and effort shown by New Yorkers who I came across. Yellow cab taxi drivers were surly and unfriendly; staff on the subway were even worse, and everyone expected a tip for the favour that they were doing for you. The restaurants were good but very overpriced for what they offered. I was told to go to Little Italy for a reasonablly priced meal but ended paying $140 for basic starters, a main courses and 4 glasses of wine for two people. So if you think New York will be a bargain, think again. Some things are cheaper but you've really got to shop around for them.

The breakfast buffet and the staff was a pleasant way to start our days - a warm welcome each morning, great coffee, great selection of tastey choices. The rooms were great - beds very, very comfy. We enjoyed our workouts in the fitness centre every day - fresh fruit always available.

We got to the hotel from the airport by a bus that picked all of us up from the terminal exit and dropped us off right in front of the hotel. The hotel itself is a quite interesting building with a fabulous lobby. Awesome reception area with a wonderful flower arrangement on a great round table exactly at the hotel's entrance. Unfortunately, though, the travel agent had booked us double rooms for four students, something that was rather unexpected, since when we entered the room we started looking for the rest of it. Fortunately, yet, all the four of us are quite slim, so we didn't have much of a problem staying in the room and sleeping at a double bed. The only problem was the limited space left at the room for four big suitcases, but we managed it then again. Generally the room was nice, and we had a nice view over the street. An other quite disturbing issue was the air-conditioning unit and the refrigerator. When we turned the air-conditioning on it made weird noises and we couldn't adjust it to maintain a stable temperature, so we had to turn it on for a while and then, when we would start to freeze, turn it off. The refrigerator was also funny to use, since when we would put some bottles of milk in for the night, we would have ice-cream ready by the time we woke up in the morning. But, generally, these were petty issues that didn't actually really bother us. The room was generally clean, although old, especially the bathroom. It was quite tricky to manage to get the hot water coming out, but once we managed to find it we left it that way. We haven't booked any breakfast options with the hotel, although I think they didn't actually offer any. Nevertheless, there was a Starbucks right at the lobby, and a small shop right across the street called Cosi, were we could get fresh bagels, coffee, and fresh orange juice for breakfast. There was also an entrance to the Grand Central station next to Cosi, allowing you to easily access the station and find a train to get you almost everywhere around Manhattan or any other New York city district. I would generally recommend it to someone wanting to visit New York, but if I could find a more modern hotel with an equally great location, I would certainly prefer the latter.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cNothing wrong with this hotel\u201d", "Author": "Flightpro", "ReviewID": "UR102565855", "Content": "Last March my wife and I stayed a couple of nights at the Roosevelt.

Also wifi was not free, however we found that there was a glitch and we could sometimes log on for free for a few minutes each day. You cannot beat the location of this hotel.

I had hopes that perhaps her room would be in better shape. When I stepped out of the lift, I was wondering through the Roosevelt's vast, rather creepy hallway, searching for the correct room. A group of kind housekeepers pointed the way. She had tears in her eyes when she opened her door! Long story short- She was freaked out, and did not want to be there. As she imagined her trip to New York quite different! I went into her bathroom to inspect the spotted \"shower curtain\" that clearly had things only a scientist would know the correct names for, and also had the misfortune of seeing a rusted pipe leaking the \"wrong kind\" of mineral water under her sink! I went to take a hand towel to clean this puddle up, and to my astonishment- the towel was oddly abrasive... crude and thin!

This 3.5 star hotel is located right in the heart of midtown. It\u2019s only a 10-15 min walk to the ESB, Times Square, Rockefeller center, radio city, etc. You are a few blocks from the nearest subway though. Penn station is a $10 cab ride. Grand central in 2 blocks away. As you walk into the lobby you're greeted by large ceilings, marble table tops, and beautiful chandeliers. There are apples for you to take, a handful of elevators so wait time was minimal and a nice lounge area to chill or grab a cocktail at the bar which is secluded but still accents the lobby so you are not far from the people walking in and out of the hotel. The \u201chelp\u201d was very courteous such as the bell hops, concierge and gift store attendant. However, the clerks behind the front desk were not very pleasant. They almost seemed annoyed that you were there. When checking in it took the clerk several minutes to check me in because there was a problem with the rate code that I used to book the room. That was solved and we checked into our room. I stayed one night with my wife and two children ages 12 and 6. We booked a 2 double room. The room itself seemed adequate by New York standards. There was a small desk, a couple of chairs, a dresser with an LCD TV on top. Room was not bad but not spectacular. The pictures on the web look exaggerated. The carpet looked a little old and dirty. It was probably in need of a replacement soon. The bed itself was comfortable and had nice goose down comforters and pillows. The room had the very basics but no coffee maker. The hotel claimed to offer free coffee in the lobby every morning but the only morning I was there I couldn\u2019t find the \u201cfree\u201d coffee. I had to buy one from the bar. Albeit, it was Starbucks, which is my fav but also $3 for one small cup of coffee that I thought was free. Possibly it\u2019s because it was a Saturday. Anyway not a biggie but those little annoyances add up quickly. The bathroom was small. The most bothersome part was the vanity. It had virtually no space to put anything. Trust me, there was room to have a large shelf or two for that matter but the only place to keep anything was a small glass shelf about a foot long and 4 inches wide. I was afraid it was going to break with all of our stuff on it. They could\u2019ve done better in the cleaning of the tile as well. The tile in the shower and throughout the bathroom had dirt/mold in the grout. Not a lot but still enough that I was starting to wonder where the 3.5 star hotel rating came from. Plenty of hot water, towels for four people and supplied soaps and shampoo. The other annoying part which was not directly the hotels fault was the traffic on the street. Normally street traffic in NY can be rather soothing but there was construction of some kind and every time a car drove past it would run over this large piece of metal in the road and make a loud \u201cthump-thump\u201d. All night long we heard \u201cthump-thump\u201d. We were on the 9th floor too and heard it as if it was right underneath us. Again, not really the hotels fault but be prepared with earplugs or a sound machine of some kind just in case. Overall this hotel was fine for what I paid ($139 + taxes = $165) and for only staying one night. I\u2019m glad that I didn\u2019t pay the normal price of $230-300 a night here because than I would have been highly upset. I\u2019m not a hotel snob but when if I\u2019m paying $250/night even in NY I expect a very nice 3 star. This was an average 3 star. Definitely not a 3.5 star. If you can book here for around $125-175/night than it\u2019s worth it, anymore than that I would look elsewhere. Email me any questions about this hotel or even NY.

Yes it is an older hotel that has seen brighter shinier days but it is welcoming and has a clean, well cared for homeyness about it. The room size was large enough for my daughter and I, both who have a tendency to sprawl out especially after shopping. I walk and this location allowed me see Central Park, the MET and Guggenheim as well as the surrounding neighborhoods. Times Square with the ticket office for Broadway shows and the hop on off bus was a very very short walk. We walked to our shows in the Theater district in the evening and for dinner as well.... That being said, cabs were quick rides to get us out of the midtown area for dinners and brunch, and shopping in the downtown areas. I think the high volume of airline crews coming and going, staying at the hotel speaks well for the hotel standard. I am a fanatic about bugs and did a check, a proper check for bedbugs in our room which includes dismantling the headboards from the wall, taking out drawers from bedside table as well as the usual mattress check with an LED flashlight. My daughter a frequent nyc visitor, laughed about my bug drill but I rested easy finding no bug poo nor bugs- but they had used a bug dust. There were dust bunnies under the bed and a few left behinds from previous tired tourists. The service was just fine, no one was rude but quite the opposite. I guess you get what you give. The beds were comfortable and when the heat was a bit much we opened the window and it cooled the room perfectly.

Went down to the bar in the lobby the next morning to grab some quick breakfast and had to remind them 3 times about the hot chocolate I ordered and paid for.

There were two families in the party - parents with a 5 year old and other family was mother and teenage daughter. We booked on a secret auction and paid GBP70 per room per night for the grade of hotel. When we won and found out the name of the allocated hotel, we read some of the reviews on Tripadvisor and they were VERY mixed. So, we were very apprehensive. However, our stay was great. The lobby is as magnificent as the pictures. The check in was great and they let us check out a few rooms before deciding on which one we wanted. The doormen and bellhop (on arrival) were helpful and we were soon settled in very comfortable rooms. I wouldn't say that they were newly renovated - the bathroom was a bit old and there was a burn on the carpet - but perfectly fine, with nice clean crisp linen and comfortable beds and pillows. And a walk in closet in our room! After a number of trips of New York, we know that we love the East side location - only a 6 block walk to Times Square. A lot of people prefer being in tourist areas like 7th avenue and the area there is geared towards the tourists, but we felt that this was more a business area with more locals on the street, which we prefer. Right across the street is an entrance to the subway/Grand Central, so you can't get much more convenient. THere are plethora of restaurants in all directions - all types and all prices, so something to fit everyone. Given that it was January and it was snowing, it was freezing cold, but the rooms were well heated. The bathrooms had plenty of hot water at all times. The staff in general were very nice and accomodating. We had an altercation with the bell hop checking out though - after throwing our luggage onto the trolley and then us (not him!) rearranging it, we didn't think he deserved a $10 tip, so we halved it and he wasn't impressed. We later saw him slagging us off to the other bell hops - so we spoke to the manager and he immediately sorted him out. Only downside - and probably to be expected from the level of hotel - internet very expensive - $15 a session and the link would drop occassionally and then it wanted to charge you for another session.

Fortunately, it was great. Booked the room on Priceline for $99. Selected midtown-East, and since there aren't many hotels (that I saw anyway) in that area, this is what I got. I couldn't have been happier with it. This part of town seems to be mostly business oriented, although it's one block from 5th Ave. and one block from Grand Central Station. It's a quiet part of town, and some retail/restaurant businesses were even closed for the weekend. As most people have mentioned, the lobby is very nice, and I did not find that the upper floors where the rooms are were appreciably different. Our room was large, clean, well maintained, and very comfortable. The controls on the heater didn't seem to work, but the temp. was comfortable so we didn't need to make any adjustments. Staff were friendly and helpful, and no one asked us for a tip. Yes, the restaurant prices were high, but I expected that at a hotel. There are plenty of places nearby to get something to eat or drink if you don't feel like paying hotel prices and are able to go out. We found breakfast at 3 different places within a block of the hotel. We found places for dinner, places to have a drink - everything we needed. It might have been nice to have a coffee maker in the room so I could have had a cup of hot tea in the evening - as it was frigid cold out the weekend we were there. But it wasn't a necessity, just something that would have been nice. I have no complaints about this hotel and would definitely stay there again.

We took the subway everywhere else, which was also VERY convenient to the hotel since there are multiple subway stations walkable to the hotel! The hotel lobby is gorgeous.

The Roosevelt is very classic in its elegance. Very clean. The staff was helpful, but not overly so. They did store out luggage for us no problem at early check in and when we checked out and still wanted to travel the city. Our room was clean and the size was decent. We did not eat at the hotel or order room service. To be honest we were never at the hotel, since we were out doing tourist attractions all day. When we were there we had no complaints though! It was FREEZING the days we were there, with the temperature well below 20 degrees. But, the hotel was fine, very warm but not too warm. We were extremely pleased.

Basically this hotel is in the middle of everything. We never had to get a taxi, we got the subway when visiting ground zero and statue of liberty because that's to long to walk. The hotel is.. Just average. The lobby is lovely and grand, but the room we stayed in was deffinately in need of updating. The bed was nice and comfy, but that is about the only good point about the room.. The air conditioning/heating unit made a loud noise all night, for some reason the carpet was incredibly static so I was continuously getting static shocks, the bathroom was OK, when running the bath water it came out a browny colour, not nice. The decor of the room was generally old fashioned, but it was liveable, it wasn't outrageously awful but could have been better. Something that annoyed us was we ordered room service, two burgers at $22 (which is alot for a burger anyway) and when they showed us the bill it was $70 I'm not sure how it added up to that but that is ridiculous money for a dry burnt burger!

We were advised before going to visit Woodberry Common and i'd advise everyone not to bother there isnt that much there its not that much cheaper than the shops in New York and it takes a while to get there and back, plus when you take into account how much the tickets are for the trip it works out no cheaper than New York at all. If you really want to do the best thing possible in New York it has to be the helicopter flight over the city there are loads of different prices and it all comes down to how much time you want in the air, we got 18 minutes and you see eveything it cost around 100 quid each but was well worth it. We also took a late night cruise around Manhatten that was really cheap around 20 quid each and the views you get are stunning you go right up next to the statue of liberty all lit up! You can walk the full length of manhatten in a few hours and to be honest its the best way to see everything, theres also a city tour open bus ride available and i'd recommend this aswell you see tons of sites and you will recognise alot of places from film and television.

My biggest complaint is that they did not have anything to do in the room. There was no internet, they didn't have Lodgenet or OnDemand so you could not watch movies, all you got was whatever was on TV.

I can only repeat what people say about the rooms. Quite compact, nice bed which was kept clean and sheets changed each day and a noisy air conditioning unit. The bathroom was musty and recent repairs to the tiling had obviously taken place. I mentioned that this was a first trip, so my surprise at no coffee or tea making facilities has now passed.

The stunning lobby of the hotel gives a false impression of the quality of the rooms. I read all the recent reviews before we went and thought that, as they were mixed, the hotel could be better than some of the more recent reviews suggest. The rooms are small(ish) but not tiny. It's the shabbiness of the rooms that really surprised me. Patches of carpet had been replaced where they'd obviously had a leak in the bathroom at some stage, but all the edges of the replaced section were badly frayed, all of the furniture was stained and damaged, the fridge was randomly in the middle of the room, paint was flaking off the ceiling, but the worst thing was the bathroom - in serious need of updating. Shower head was loose from wall, bath was badly chipped and a little mouldy - floor looked really grubby. We asked to look at two other rooms thinking that if we upgraded to a more expensive room, the quality would be better, but actually the Deluxe room and the Suite were of equally poor quality. So we then tried to change hotel but it was Thanksgiving Day and everywhere else was booked up - we were so disappointed because we were on our honeymoon. Plus the air conditioning unit in the room was really noisy to the point where we had to switch it off so that we could get some sleep and had to open window instead - but the city lives up to its reputation of the 'city that never sleeps' and the horns, roadworks etc went on ALL NIGHT. On top of that, the service received in the bar was really bad - a couple of the waiters were nice but the rest were surly and actually damn right rude (they automatically add service to your order so guess they feel that they don't need to deliver a reasonable standard of service). They even kicked two hotel guests out of the bar because they weren't buying drinks and therefore earning them tips. Concierge staff weren't particularly helpful, got the feeling that they were sending people to places that they have a personal link too rather than what might suit the guest.

Not once did he mention the tkts booth at Times Square which we knew about, and got the same tickets for $65 each.

It is in easy walking distance of lots of the sights that New York is famous for. Walking in New York is the best way to see the sights.

We were having a late drink one night whilst two weddings were being held there, and the atmosphere and people in the bar were brilliant. The rooms were spot on, not huge but big enough. Also had a very comfy bed. After reading some of the comments on here regarding the state of the rooms, we had a good look around when we got to it. Yes, they may be slightly dated and the bathroom was a bit on the small side, but this is really just being picky as the room had everything we needed.

I read others' reviews about the staff but from my limited interaction with them they were nice and friendly and generally very helpful. As for the hotel itself, the location is superb. It's worth staying here for that alone. I was traveling alone but was given a room with 2 double beds so there was plenty of room. The bathroom wasn't the biggest but why anyone would complain about not having a massive bathroom is beyond me. What do people be doing in there? There was room to stand at the sink and do my stuff and the bath was a decent size. That complaint from other reviewers confused me. The rooms are a bit dated and look a bit shabby but my one wasn't dirty anyway it was cleaned to a decent standard each morning. My one complaint about the room was the air conditioning unit. It really was loud. Luckily it wasn't the warmest in NY when I was there so I left it on when i wasn't there and turned it of in the evening and it didn't get too warm. I didn't eat in the restaurant or drink in the bar as the prices were very expensive but there's a lovely cafe across the road and down on the corner towards Grand Central Station that I got a lovely breakfast for under $10. The fitness room was very good and not too busy any of the mornings I went and they also have complimentary fruit there so that was a nice way to start the day. MY room didn't have a mini bar but I don't know if that is standard throughout the hotel. I don't generally take stuf out of mini bars but I do like to use it to keep my own bought stuff cool. One other complaint i have is the lack of free wi-fi. Surely a hotel of this size and stature should have free wi-fi in the lobby. i can understand them charging in the rooms but in this day and age, they really should have it in the lobby. I ended up having to go to Barnes & Noble around the corner to check up on emails and read the news from home There are a couple business centres with internet access for a fee but one thing I discovered is that there is the facility in the business centre on the 2nd floor to print out your boarding pass for free which is good.

Usually we tip if they have satisfied our needs or more, and only don't tip if we're super unhAppy. We ran into an incident with the bellman where we did not have any small change and planned on not tipping. However we encountered an awkward hinting an silence until weshuffled our pockets for whatever change we had, and we had only 50cents.

We stopped for petrol on the way out whcih was unprecented as it was his local petrol station and we drove ten to fifteen minutes off the highway to get to it. it was an agreed flat fare of $55 inc tax and tip and I wasn't paying a cent over the agreed number.

For the price we paid per night the hotel provided excellent value for money. The hotel has a superb location on Madison Avenue. Grand Central Terminal is just a few minutes walk away. However, these attractions aside, standards within the Roosevelt are not entirely consistent. The most appealing element of the hotel is its its sumption lobby. This conveys a sense of history and on arrival is most attractive. We used the atmospheric bar, located in a raised area to the left of the entrance, most evenings. Despite being attached to a busy entrance hall the bar has a distinctive character. The walls are panelled with dark wood, fire places are positioned at either end and the liveried bar staff are faultlessly polite and efficient. Drinks are routinely brought to your table with a large bowl of mixed nuts. If you like to retire to your hotel's bar following a busy day of sightseeing you will find this a very engaging and relaxing place to spend an hour or so. Beer was priced at $8 a pint which is expensive by UK standards. We didn't sample the bar food. Our room was large, and contained a very comfortable bed. Upgrading to a kingsize room proved a sound decision. The ensuite bathroom was of a reasonable size and everything within worked well. The room appeared clean and towells were changed regularly. However, the room did have a number of shortcomings. Inevitably, given the position of the hotel, adjacent to some very tall buildings, the room was very dark inside. The absense of pictures on the wall, apart from one above the bed, added to the somewhat cheerless atmosphere. A considerable amount of noise from the road below could be heard every night. In addition to the traffic this included quite a lot of bangs and crashes that may have emanated from dust carts and the like. The air conditioning unit, cited beneath the window, was clearly very old. It made a considerable amount intrusive noise particularly when the dial was set to the 'cold' position. I would certainly consider staying in this hotel again, given the location and excellent value for money but in view of some of the shortcomings of our room cannot make an unreserved recommendation.", "Date": "April 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cOld glamour...yeah, nice...but old...\u201d", "Author": "StrictView", "ReviewID": "UR62271933", "Content": "Booking: I won a bid on Priceline.

Just a shower, and it was more like a wet room. I think the bathroom was for a disabled visitor due to the chair in the shower. The only annoying thing was the shower area was slightly higher on a slope so everytime you had a shower the water would go all over the rest of the bathroom floor. Not well designed. However, I don't think it is like this in every bathroom. There is also little space to put your toiletries in the bathroom. The hairdryer in the bathroom worked well.

To me, this hotel is in THE perfect location, only a block from Grand Central Terminal, 2 or 3 blocks (avenues, so longer) from Times Square, about 3 short blocks from Rockefeller Center, easy walk up Madison and 5th avenues. I love the old world feel of The Roosevelt, the lobby is just beautiful, feels very \"fancy\" when you first walk in, but not snobbish at all. The concierge and front desk people were helpful and not rude in any way, answering our questions gladly. I've read in reviews that the elevators are slow and too busy, but I don 't think there was anything out of the way in that area. We had asked for an upper floor, we were on the 18th, but there wasn't a great view, just some office buildings, oh well. We had a double/double room. It was small, as most NY hotels are, but even with the four of us, it was fine. After all, you don't go to NY to spend all your time in the room, do you? If you put away your suitcases, you can move around just fine. One thing that I didn't like, even though we had a flat screen TV, it apparently wasn't hooked up to a great cable system, it was very \"snowy\", and my other gripe, no coffee maker for caffeine addicted me! Otherwise, our room was fine, cleaned daily, plenty of towels, a little fridge for sodas. The beds were very comfortable and had very nice snowy white duvets. We didn't use room service (an expensive waste in my mind, no matter where we stay), so I can't comment on that. We also didn't eat in the hotel restaurants, choosing to find less expensive options. We DID get coffee from the Starbucks in the lobby one morning, paying those usual Starbuck's prices, and too much for hot water and a tea bag for my husband. Oh, I didn't mention that we booked this hotel through Hotwire (I had the hotels and their features narrowed down in that neighborhood). We only paid $159/night, which is a great value for a midtown hotel.

Also in our safe was our passports, my mobile phone and an egagement ring which I had for my girlfriend but only the money was taken. When we got in, we reported the incident immediateley to the Hotel security and also to the New York Police Department. Security in the hotel deemed that the safe had been made defective and so did the NYPD were hotel security also had access that an unamed key card had entered our room around 4pm in the afternoon. After a distraught start to the holiday I asked the hotel security when we would get our money back and that we would have no money in the mean time. William Rodriguez, hotel security advised it would take around 1 week possibly that we would have to wait as it is policy that they cannot do anything about this situation but go through the hotels insurance. Once it had all sunk in we were advised to call up relatives to wire money whilst we there so we could still enjoy our holiday and that the hotel would take care of our room service. After asking for the rest of the four days for more information, we were not kept in the loop on the whole situation and that they had no information and as soon as the insurance claim no. came through they would know more. We returned home were we constantly tried to keep in contact with the hotel were Ernie Boyd, the Hotel Security Director continued to tell us that he is waiting on the insurance and to contact the insurance because his \"end\" of the investigation was complete. I read on this website a similar incident had happened in Dec 09 and that when the insurance came back they said they were not liable for the loss of property. We have just receieved our email from the insurance and they have done exactly the same thing. This is completely unacceptable in my opinion. How can a hotel get away with, on more than one occasion for that matter? We had such high hopes for the Roosevelt Hotel as it is such a beautiful building in such a good location but let me tell everyone who is considering on visiting the hotel is to NOT go. The service is poor, and in such situations as the one we were in, Hotel security is well below average. For someone to steal just cash from inside a safe, fully knowing how to get into the room safe is a clear inside job within the hotel. Why did they not steal my mobile, an expensive egagement ring, passports? If this was just a thief from the streets im sure they would have taken the whole lot. Someone within that hotel knows that their insurance does not cover loss of cash and the Director of Security tells me that his investigation is \"complete\" without a guilty party being found. Disgusting. Truly, truly disgusting from a hotel. So all in all, The Roosevelt hotel cost us the price for the room, \u00a32,300 in loss of money and also another \u00a31,200 which we now have to pay back to a family member because there scam of insurance tells us it wont pay up, all for a weeks stay.

I had a couple of issues (shower with no cold water, remote battery died) and they were swiftly responsive and cheery throughout. The rooms were on the small side, but very typical for New York. My first room (before the shower made me change) had a bathroom that was so small the door actually hits the toilet and won't open the whole way. Not cute. :-) In the second room, the bathroom door just cleared the toilet by a hair's breath. :-) There was no vanity, which was a bit of a pain, but not the end of the world. I like a very warm room so the very toasty Roosevelt rooms were great for me. However, my friend Curtis, who likes things to be cool, would have been absolutely miserable, such as the extent of the non-adjustable heat. So that's something to keep in mind. But I LOVED it!! The bed was comfortable, The area was very central and I came in and out walking every time, at all hours. When I checked out I had to leave my bags so that I could go to my meeting and then come back to retrieve them before heading home. Both bell captains were cheery, full of humor, and just very nice.

We had one breakfast here which cost $22 for adults and $11 for the children each. Great selevtion and typical hotel breakfast very good. We found it difficult finding good reasonably priced restaurants to eat at in the evenings. There is Central Station over the road but to be honest its basically fast food. One evening we went the the Cinema Cafe on 60th this was excellent. Last night we treated ourselves to Jazz at Dizzys this iwas excellent and highly recommend it .

Withing 10 minutes walk you're in Times Square, 5th Avenue, Grand Central, Rockafeller. Great first impression with its big, impressive foyer. Our room was a good size, although I did see some very small rooms which I thanked my stars we didn't get. Generally the decor in the room was a bit tired, the carpets were warn, tiles in the bathroom were cracked, the shower was dated and strictly average etc. On the plus side, the room had a good bed and a new big flat screen TV as well, and had a great view up Madison Avenue (although this tended to be noisey at night - no real complaints about that though, its not like we expected silence!) The $15 a day Internet wasn't working \"in that room at this time\" and so went to the coffe shop across the street for free access - not sure how I would have felt if this had been a business trip and I was relying on internet avaliability. We felt the overall service could have been improved a litlle - - Room service plates remained outside our room for 24 hours. When mentioning this in passing to a housekeeping staff member I was told it was not her problem, I'd need to speak to room service. - Upon check out we requested help to carry our bags from the 5th floor to a cab (for which we would have tipped hansomly), after two phone calls and 20 minutes, we struggled down ourselves to find 4 bell boys chatting in reception. 1 bag was carried 5 metres to a cab and the appropriately reduced tipped was met with scorn and disbelief. - The conceirge was a little dismissive and ready to rip me off. I inquired about a ticket for a hockey match and was told it was sold out unless I paid $200. A simple search on the venues website got me a great ticket for $70. He could have done this for me on his computer and I'd have happily paid him for this service. My advice would be if you are staying here, just use it just to sleep. Other services are not good value. Which is a shame, as it basically means that a once grand hotel has basically lost touch with the expectations of a modern traveller. If you're going to charge $30 for breakfast, I honestly don't mind crossing the street and paying $10 for the same plate of pancakes from a coffee shop.

The hotel lobby looks stunning. It's got a real classy look to it and it's absolutely spotless. Looks like something out a really old movie. In the lobby there is a view shops and a bar which I can't comment on because we never ate or drank there, looked expensive. Check in was easy. We were on the 4th floor. The room was impressive, and big for NYC standards. The bed is massive and very comfy. Almost to comfy. The bathroom is a decent size also. Everything is clean. And the flat screen tv adds a nice finish to the room. The rooms do look old but not dirty. The hotel is right next to 5th avenue so is ideal if you like shopping. Times Square is about a 5 - 10 walk, central park - about 15 - 20. The area is very safe. Infact the whole of NYC is safe. I was there for 6 nights and never got in a taxi once. We walked from midtown all the way to downtown and across the Brooklyn Bridge. The only negative things I can say about this hotel are that the bell boys are rubbish and look for tips at any opportunity. The guy wanted a tip for lifting my bags about 5 yards. I was thinking eh no chance mate, if you told me where my bags were I would get them my self. The guy stood and looked at me in disgust when he realised I wasn't tipping him. I have travelled from Edinburgh with them bags and he wants a tip for carrying them 5 yards. NO CHANCE. I would rather carry my own and my girlfriends bag anyway. Another negative about the hotel was that it charges $15 a day for the internet, which I think is a joke. I didn\u2019t bother with it. Instead i walked directly across the road to the coffee shop and got it for free. Apart from the annoying bell boys and the lack of free internet the Roosevelt is great.

As you walk up the stairs and into the lobby, it is very grand and impressive. Lovely Christmas decorations, lobby area very clean and cosy. Check in was relatively simple after a minor error on their part was resolved. Room Room very small. Double bed was very inviting and comfortable after a long day roaming the streets of New York, although on our last day as we were packing away our things we noticed that there was dried blood on the mattress itself, not good. D\u00e9cor was much to be desired, with very large burnt/brown patch on the carpet. Big screen TV which was good when getting ready for bed in the evenings. Not much of a view from our room and ended up having to keep the curtains closed the majority of the time due to an office block directly opposite full of people working, we were concerned they could see in to our room, they were close enough. Room very noisy at night from outside traffic, garbage trucks etc. Bathroom was very small also but functional. Did not have a bath, shower only which was quite pleasant although did take us a while to shower due to ridiculously low water pressure. Hairdryer located in the bathroom but was basically useless as it would cut out power after 2minutes and remained useless for the whole week. Both myself and boyfriend who don\u2019t normally suffer from allergies, woke up at least once during the night and every single morning coughing, sneezing, itchy/red/irritable eyes, which took us at least 30 minutes to 1 hour to \u2018get up and get going\u2019 as we felt so weak and lethargic, these symptoms gradually went away once outside but unfortunately did return every night and again in the morning. The only explanation we could think could be the cause could have been was dust mites/ bed bugs/ mould etc ?. Who knows. Second day in we ended up having to buy painkillers and anti-allergy medication to get through the week. Bedding was changed and fresh towels were provided everyday by the maids, in which they would give the room a general tidy up. Only niggle we had with the maids was they would wake you up at silly o\u2019clock every morning (6am so on) for housekeeping and then would persist on waking you up every 20 minutes until you basically got up, if you didn\u2019t respond to them/ hear them they would also call your room. Overall for the price we paid a bigger and more pleasant room would have been welcomed. But was ok for our first trip to New York as was only used as a base. The allergen problem could have been done without and when feeling like that every morning due to the room, the maids continuously waking us up could have been done without also. Busy time of year so upgrades etc were not possible. Staff With the very little contact we required from the staff at The Roosevelt, they were ok. If short answers and no eye contact is ok by you then this is how they work. Concierge was asked a simple question, what time is check out? In which he shouted the answer at us as if we were stupid and didn\u2019t take his eyes away from his news paper the whole time, whilst patronising his more helpful colleague for being more helpful. Location This would be the main reason why The Roosevelt Hotel would be chosen as the place of stay due to the location. Everywhere you would need/ want to do/go is a stones throw away. 10 minutes from Times Square, 15 minutes from Broadway, 1 avenue from 5th av, 15 minutes walk away from Central Park, Grand Central Station round the corner and so on. Overall, if a much better room was available, the allergen problem got taken care of and no other hotels were available, we would probably consider staying here again or recommending to a friend.

We picked this hotel because it was the cheapest hotel we can find on the internet that was atleast 3* and on manhatton island. As you walk in you'll notice that the hotel really is in an excellent location, 45 minutes walk from central park, 30 minutes walk from timesquare and 10 minutes walk from grand central station. The lobby is very impressive and had a 25ft christmas tree at the time. You join a short queue for a well staffed desk that quickly found our room, they didnt recall our request for a smoking room and quickly swapped us to one implying that the hotel wasn't full at the time. There are no ash trays in the room, the only thing that lets you know its a smoking floor is the smell that hits you when you leave the lift. Our room was very small, it had one queen sized bed with a dresser, a huge LCD TV with analogue satellite and the premium channels. I'm guessing it was satellite because it kept falling out of synch or crashing for 5-10seconds. The bathroom was dissappointing, it was clean but it was so badly designed. The towel rack was above the toilet so towels fell in it, so was the electric hair dryer! There was plug sockets in the bathroom and it did have an extractor fan that kept the room steam free, no bath. The rest of the room was a bit delapidated, the carpet goes 6 inches up the wall but doesnt stick to it so I spent some time fishing stuff out of the gap between the dresser and the wall carpet, there was a massive burn mark on the carpet. The electrical points (plug sockets) were falling off the wall but didn't spark or anything. The room was well lit with 2 lamps, one had 2 halogen bulbs which helps for reading etc. The room was directly accross from a call centre with clear windows so monday to friday we had to keep our curtains closed most of the time. It takes a lot of force to open the window, Im just a normal guy that doesnt work out and it took all my strength to lodge the window an inch, definitely not a room for the elderley! The hotel is located next to a traffic junction on Madison where the road has worn away, the solution was to place giant steel plates over the delapidated parts of the road like loose makeshift bridges. These bridges bang at every hour of the night and I was frequently woken up by a truck hitting the steel, it really is as loud as a bomb. We were definitely allergic to something in the room, we're still not sure if it was a dusty room, duck feather pillows etc. but it left us very drowsy in the mornings. We didn't want to spend all day figuring it out so we stayed in that room. The maid service comes as early as 08:30, one day they came at this time and seemed to come back every hour until 12:30 when they suggested they come back at four. This routine of coming every hour starting between 09:00 and 10:00 happened every day and they would keep coming back, one day they even rang our room after knocking the door for a few hours in a row. I don't think its their fault, someone somewhere needs to lighten up a bit on the importance of maid service. Obviously being a bit ill from the room we have a different experience to other people that would be out by 08:00am every day. The lobby staff didn't blow our mind either. We asked where to leave luggage from am to pm on our last day and a guy said 'Just leave it there' pointing toward a gap between his desk and the disabled toilet entrance without looking us in the eye, from his uniform I'm guessing he was the head porter..... Turned out there was a ticketed luggage room that was pass-coded that sounded a bit more like it. No one told us about any of the hotel facilities, the girl on the desk just told us to read the book in the room. We tried to visit the restaurant once and the guy sent us to the bar for bar snacks, they were nice and reasonably priced mind you. We didn't try any of the other facilities like the computer room, we visited the bar twice and noticed that the prices for our drinks increased by ~20% from friday to saturday (we ordered the same drinks a few times both days). As you walk around the hotel you notice little things that simply suggest that its in need of renovation. The varnish is stratched off the bar, the skirting boards around the mezzanine floor were really yellowed, even the ethernet points (a recent/modern thing?) looked really yellowed. Everything you would see between the front entrance and the desk is immaculate. The toilets were immaculate and the gentleman in the gift shop needs a medal, very nice guy that helped us spend our last few dollars. The hotel has wifi through AT&T, it's very expensive like $15 per day for $70 for five days. I gave up and tried paying for it through my iphone, it wouldn't accept a card outside the USA. There was a feature to bill to my room but they refused to accept my mastercard so I didn't want to rack up stuff on my debit card. When we left the hotel on the final day it was problem free until we went to hail a cab. Now cabs are $45 flat fee to the airport (+tip ofc) so when the doorman of the roosevelt offered us an idle limo for $55 we trusted him. We got to the airport and the limo driver then wanted $70, what are you suppose to do when you're about to get on a plane?

I called down and had them bring towels up. The room was on the innner court so heard a humming of machinery all night. The next day I asked to be moved and they gave us the room we had ordered -- it was bigger and on the outside also had better lamps etc. Still the carpet needed replacing as it did throughout the hotel. I had to call down each day fro towels as they always left some out -- eitjher face clothes, hand towels ot bath towels. The water pressure was poor and there were no glass cups only paper cups. The maid did not clean the ice bucket out, not remove the wine glasses that we had used (I asked for some to be brought up). All in all it was dissapointing and still not inexpensive. Even the furniture in the lobby was dirty and worn. At one time I suppose this was an opulent littlehotel -- not any more. THe desk clerk told me that it has not been renovated for ten years. That is a long time in New York. Don't stay here.

When we got to the check in desk, the staff were friendly and helpful but had somehow messed up the booked and stated that we were only booked in for 3 nights, however when she checked the system again she realised she was looking instead at a reservation in 2010 (very strange I know, and I hope they havnt got us booked in for then!) It was rectified quickly and she apologised and we were given a room on the seventh floor with a view of the street on Madison Avenue. The rooms are a very good size, and the beds are quite comfy however they do not know how to make a bed properly and do not have bedding that actually fits the beds! The wallpaper as many have described and the decor of the rooms is somewhat tired and does have the look of nursing home style! There was a nice TV with cable channels and an air conditioning unit however we didn\u2019t touch it! The bathrooms were by far the most tired feature of the rooms, with the shower head not stuck to the wall properly and a bath that would not hold water for any length of time as well as the sink as the plug allowed it to drain. We didn\u2019t experience any of the 'brown water' cases as others suggested and always had hot water. There are 6 lifts in the hotel, but you can be waiting a little time for them. The longest we had to wait for one was 5 mins and this was on our last day. We never eat in the hotel, tried breakfast their once at the Starbucks, would not recommend it, but good if you have no idea where to go on your first day. There is if you are unsure where to eat on your first night, a great Italian restaurant called 'Naples 45,' which is reasonably priced and great food! Overall the hotel did what we needed it to do. We got the hotel at a great price on Expeida, but if I had paid the \u00a31300 the room would have cost if I had booked direct with the hotel, then I would not be happy. We were hardly in the hotel much only to sleep and come back to in the afternoon for a rest, so if that is all your looking for and you get it at a good price, then yes, the Roosevelt would be a fine option.... it was clean, and had all the amenities we needed, however if you are looking for something a bit more, and are bothered about the tired looks and stained carpets in the hall ways etc then I would look to stay somewhere else. If the hotel were to have a complete renovation then this hotel could be amazing! Just a bit of TLC is needed, but I think due to the sheer size of the hotel (1000+ rooms) it is too big for the staff to care for it, or for them to update it. eg. at the bell boys desk there were 7 members of staff all doing the same job when 3 could have done it easily. If you need a hotel that is in a great location with rooms that a comfortable and not bothered about eating there then the Roosevelt would be suitable.", "Date": "November 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "ireland", "Title": "\u201can awful experience\u201d", "Author": "murphysam", "ReviewID": "UR48359982", "Content": "My husband and I stayed in the Roosevelt hotel.We were on honeymoon and New York was our last stay.

The Roosevelt Hotel does not quite measure up to industry standards. I will recognize the bell staff and bar waiter for their attentive service - but it stops there. One of my colleagues rooms was not ready until 7:30pm in the evening and was told there was 'no place to change clothes' I was originally checked into an accessible room - with no fixed shower head. I asked to move but was told I'd have to wait another day even though there were plenty of rooms ready when I first arrived. I also had to re-pack all my belongings and store with the bell stand yet again - frustrating when you are in town for business. I was not alerted that I even had this room type to begin with. The pillows in the rooms have pointed ends on all fours - I woke up one morning with a large scratch down the side of my face. It was red and cut up enough for my colleagues to notice the next morning. Although food in New York is expensive, $30 for oatmeal and coffee seemed extreme. Maids do not knock before entering a room and they are quick to enter between 8am-8:30am so make sure you have your deadbolt locked. I also had trouble understanding the English from some of the employees- including two bell man. Elevators- it is impossible to get one to not stop at every floor. It seems every time you need to go to your room, they are always busy. Though this is trivial, it became rather annoying being in the 14th floor and having 5 stops or more every time I had to use one. Lastly when I was packing up the day before I left, I noticed a small 'pebble dropping' on the bed comforter. Not sure where that came from, but I'd rather not know. From what I've heard, this hotel had improved quite a bit from where it was last year, but by no means does it even compare to staying at an average Holiday Inn.

The decor of the rooms is what I would call \"nursing home style\" with what seems to be plastic pink walls, not even wallpaper. The light bulbs have all been replaced with flourescent energy saving ones - which is a nice gesture for their wallets and the environment, but there's a happy medium that they did not strike. These were bottom of the barrel and the lampshades weren't big enough to cover them, so the overall effect was of an interrogation room. There was no cable TV, so we had fuzzy TV reception. There's no coffee maker, so we paid $54 for a medium pot of coffee and two orders of toast in the morning. And as the title suggests, the piece de resistance was the 3-inch cockroach that scuttled across the institution-like bathroom floor and clung to the plastic shower curtain.

(not enough room to open suitcase easily) bathroom exceptionally small and a lack lustre shower. If your over 5.6ft forget a comfortable shower, lots of crouching required - and I have a slim build! Noisey - The AC unit was LOUD....hotel unable to do anything about it.....sorry I meant couldn't be bothered o Spoke to reception who said no rooms were available unless I was willing to pay an upgrade! (which means empty rooms existed...just not for someone whose booking and monies thay already had!!!)not what you would expect from this level of hotel found the attitude unhelpful - you could see my problem - they need to prewarn guests about the exact size of their 'cozy' rooms and that they are noisey and those that are not fit for purpose should be made part of a 'special deal' not a standard rate! Stayed a week - so surprised that another room was not available. On the whole - lucky to be on business and not pleasure (since this minimised the time drastically at the hotel) Next trip to NY having having stayed at the belevedre and sofitel will be looking to stay there instead, both similairish in location much better service and after the jet lag, sleepless in need of revival!!!!

(Ok, some may consider this a \"plus\", but when you have a car full of people and stuff, and you not only have to pay for parking but tip the driver also... well, it didn't do it for me.) -Food/drinks are very very expensive. If you are on a budget, forget eating there! I think it was $15 for a bowl of oatmeal or something like that. $8 for a beer in the lounge. -Regular rooms are small.

Great food and shops are aplenty within a one block radius of the Roosevelt. Although the room service seemed expensive, there are several outside restaurants in the area that will deliver right to your room. I had a problem with the first room they assigned to us (I'm a large 6'3\" and they gave us a queen bed which made my feet hang over the end), but a quick call downstairs and they moved us to a room with a king sized bed with no trouble.

Once we were even traveling with another couple, they had got a smaller room and talked to the desk person in front of us and got upgraded to a bigger room like we had orginally booked. Then I step up to the counter, right behind my friends, and they tell us that they have NO rooms ready right now. About 45 minutes later we got a room. This is pathetic!!! Checkin is at 3:00 here and once we did not get in till 4:30. There is also an older gray haired lady with glasses and an accent that works the counter. She has been there everytime we have visited. STAY AWAY from her. She is undoubtly the rudest person that hates her job I have ever come in contact with. Now to the good stuff. The hotel is nice and appears to be somewhat well kept to NY standards. It is very convenient to Grand Central and not a bad walk to Times Square or Rockefeller Center. There is also a nice store to get breakfast, snacks or even a quick meal diaganolly to the left out the main door (45st). Most shopping up and down Madison and other locations are close by too. The rooms are about average size for NY but the bathrooms are tiny and have no storage or shelving to place things. So therefore make sure the toilet lid is down anytime you are in the bathroom and it is not being used or be prepared to just right off personal items! Also the first time we stayed here the room was a bit noisey but the last few times we did not seem to hear as many sirens, horns or vehicle traffic. Everytime we have upgraded to the larger rooms but everytime them seemed to be getting smaller. Some upgrade rooms are obviously larger than others. No use to complain though. There is also a nice bar in the lobby with helpful bartenders and supposedly a roof top bar in the summer months but we never made it up to it. We stopped and looked at the fitness center but we never used it though. It appeared to be set up mostly with treadmills and cardio equipment and somewhat small.

It was my first visit to NYC and although I loved NYC I would not stay at the Roosevelt Hotel. When upon arriving the hotel is impressive due to the decor and grandeur of the lobby, but that's where it ends. We purchased our accommodations online as they were offering rooms at half price - so 150.00 a night, so it was worth it for that but would definitely not pay 300.00 a night to stay there. Ok the pros are it is in a fantastic location, walking distance to Times Square, Central Park. one block away from Central Station, Good Bed and New TV Monitor. The cons: The hallways and rooms look outdated and used, would need a plaster and paint job. The rooms are very small, best suited to wash up and sleep - not to stay in for long periods, use the lobby - more pleasant!!! They do not provide a coffee machine, so if you are like me and look forward to that first sip of coffee in the morning - you'll have to wait 'till you get outside. All the hotel services cost - YOU PAY for EVERYTHING and in my opinion are too expensive. For example, 1) they provide Starbucks Coffee in the lobby at double the price that star buck charges, and by the way there is a Star Bucks coffee shop one block away, 2) They provide wireless internet at 17.00 a day - most places provide this free of charge 3) Be ready to tip always for services you may not want, when we arrived a Hotel Staff grabbed our suitcases and delivered them to our room without asking - so of course we had to tip. Here are some tips that may save you some money, whereas going through the hotel may cost you more. In Central Station, there is a booth with several free guides on restaurant prices and locations, attractions etc. I suggest to check this out, you can then pick restaurants within your price range and there are several good ones to choose from. The Subway is a practical and cheap way to get around. We were quite impressed with it's efficiency and cleanliness. The hotel will try to sell you the idea of taking a cab to the airport. We took a shuttle service for half the cost, and with 24 hour reservations, they will drive you to the Hotel and pick you up from this location - http://www.nyairportservice.com/page.php?id=31.

I find the lobby to be quiet and inviting. It was built in a golden age of american architecture, and I enjoy the class and elegance the hotel lobby displays. Upon check in , there are always plenty of people to check you in our out no matter the time of day. Once you have your key there are about 5 elevators that unfortunately can be quite slow as they have many floors to cover and they operate a bit slowly. Once you arrive to your room you may find it to be a bit small for your tastes, but this is typical for NYC. The bed is elegant and quite comfortable, even if you end up in one of their smaller \"cozy\" rooms where the bed takes up most of the room! The bathrooms are always clean with ample supplies. I suppose the only criticism is that the carpeting and decor is a bit outdated and dull. I was upgraded to a suite once which was really nothing more than a regular room, with an additional smaller room that had an ugly green carpet and a gross looking couch in it. Nonetheless, its quiet and comfortable. I have not eaten in the restaurant so I can't comment on that, but I've spent plenty of time having a night cap or an after work drink at the hotel bar. It's quiet and classy, with attentive bartenders. There's also small tables if you prefer to be alone. Excellent assortment of fine liquors (i'm a scotch guy), or just a beer. It's a little pricey to be honest, but the ambience is inviting. It's not rowdy or even noisy even when it's crowded. I've gotten room service many times and the food has always been delicious and on time. Try the Salmon with a half bottle of white wine. The best feature as a business traveler is that they have a car service available almost any time to take you right to LaGuardia or JFK. This beats finding a taxi hands down. I believe its $40 (not including gratuity), which really isnt' that much more than a taxi would cost. I take the shuttles out of LaGuardia and I know if I'm staying at the Roosevelt I can check my bags with the bell desk, go to my meetings during the day, and get right in a town car to the airport quickly. If you want to save a buck, see if anyone else waiting in line wants to split it with you. I've done that a few times and had some good conversations with folks from all sorts of industries and locales on the way. The Roosevelt isn't cheap, but it's not outrageous either. It's in a prime location where you will get every penny you pay for. It's worth it. SIgn up for their email specials and you won't be dissapointed.

We had to wait in a line for check in but this was a problem each day we walked by at 3pm.I suggest showing up a little later for check in if you can. And when our cab pulled up the bellman didnt offer to help with our bags. I was glad we didnt have too much. It saved us the tip. If you want to spend over 500.00 a night in the city the best place for me is The NY Palace! Hands down. But if you want a nice place but not the price tag then I strongly urge you to try The Roosevelt. The location is close to everything and beautifully decorated. I felt like i had walked back in time. Ive stayed at THE PALACE many times and love it but its just got too expensive in our economic crunch right now.

There are some very, very nice things about this hotel - and some not so great - but don't pass this hotel by - it's a good value in an otherwise very expensive area of mid-town. Here is more detail for those first timers that I had wished I knew prior to my stay... Location, location, location as mentioned, near Grand Central at 45th and Madison - nearby is Times Square, and loads of subway choices, restaurants, shopping, and plentiful taxicabs. As everyone says, the lobby is beautiful, and has a nice seating area if you are waiting for friends. It's fun to people watch and see the bustle. There's a bellhop and concierge service. There's a coffee bar (agree with other posts you can do better elsewhere, but in a rush it's OK). As opposed to some comments, my check-in experience was very good, and my person was quite nice. I had booked open choice two or one bed; I was asked if a King bed was acceptable, and I agreed. I think now a room with two beds might get you a slightly larger room, but for 1 person the room I had was fine. There are a number of elevators in the lobby, but it is hard to figure out if they are going down, or up - and the punch buttons are only on either side of the bank with no button in the middle. It was actually funny to watch newbies (like me) first look in the middle for the button, and then search the bank for the buttons on the side. At busy times there was a bit of a wait. The room I received (a king on the 7th floor) was at the end of two very long corridors. My room took some time to find. This is a big place, with odd numbered rooms on one side, even on the other. Note that the room number signs don't tell you this, I had to figure it out after wandering down various hallways. Something about the older style reminded me of the Overlook Hotel from the Shining - but thankfully without the horror. The hallways were clean, sort of like grandma's house with a little old musty smell and flowery carpeting with a few stains here and there. The musty smell turned out later to be mostly from the soap and shampoo products in the rooms - which have a peculiar smell - they say aloe, but the fragrence is a bit more cloying than that to me. You get two small soaps, shampoo, conditioner and lotion in little bottles. The soap is very drying, so bring your own if that bothers you. My room was at the end of the hall, and was small, but very clean. The hallway was clear, except for some trays here and there, and someone had left a broken wine glass on the hallway floor that took a day to have cleaned up. The room appointments included the king bed, LCD TV, chest, desk and chair with internet connection access, separate comfy chair, and bathroom. The bed seemed new, and was very comfortable (firm, yet not too hard.) Soft white linens, generous number of pillows, and a mini-coverlet in gold were on the bed. Some hotel pictures with the designer \"R\" bed pillows were not to be found in this room, but no big deal. The room was a bit hot, so I turned on the older style floor model combo A/C and heater. It worked fine, but was a little loud. Turns out that was a good thing, as each of the two nights I stayed, there was heavy machinery noise from the outside inclusive of rings and beeps that I could hear even over the A/C from 12 mid to around 2 in the morning. Not the hotel's fault - but if you are a light sleeper, recommend ear plugs. I also agree with other posts that you can hear everything in the hallway, from conversations, baby cries, to door knocks, opening and closings, and slams. Thankfully, not too much could be heard in the room from neighbors in their rooms, mostly noise from hallway and outside. (Note the window could open to the outside, but I did not use it.) My neighbors were either a group of goats, or a bunch of wild guys coming in at all hours. Not my business, other than a couple of them banging on my door at 3 in the morning thinking it was their room. I ignored this, and the guys stumbled into their room (after banging that door), and the episode was over. There's a new flat screen LCD TV in the room with fairly good reception, but the higher number channels were fuzzy, and as mentioned in other reviews not a lot of choice of channels - but who spends that much time in the room, anyway? Surprising to me for an older hotel was that there was enough adequate lighting that all worked, and enough mirrors. The room, while small, had a fairly large closet right near the entranceway, with an iron and ironing board available. The overall feel of the room was like staying in grandma's attic room - old, small, clean, layers of cream colored paint and wallpaper, a bit mismatched, a little musty, but mostly cozy and workable. I know it sounds odd, but that was the feeling. The bathroom was very clean, but a bit uninspired. You could see where new tiles had been put in the shower area, with a bowed out curtain bar (nice touch giving more shoulder room), new shower curtain (nice, but did not match decor), a pedestal sink (pretty, but does not give counter space), commode (right next to ancient radiator so little room. and the commode seat was crooked), and two small glass shelves without too much space. The tub had two enamel gouges that someone attempted to repair with enamel paint. Large mirror, with an ugly industrial light, which made the room seem a bit sad and garishly lit. Not good for makeup application. There was a hair dryer, medium wattage - the dryer had a little night light on it, a nice touch. Plenty of clean white towels - but first night no washcloths. TP is cheap and harsh, so bring your own if you are sensitive to same. No coffee maker. No mini-bar. Ice bucket and glasses; soda machines down the hall with ice available. Surprisingly, no NY magazines, maps or tourist publications in the room, you had to ask at the desk or concierge. Checkout can be via TV/phone, but I went to the desk. No problems with my bill. Note that there are a number of city taxes that apply in addition to your room rate per night (almost +$30.) We had a breakfast in the Roosevelt restaurant (mezzanine level just up from the lobby.) Pretty ambience, nice buffet and menu, but EXPENSIVE. There are nearby cheaper places. My overall experience was that this place had all the necessities and is in an incredibly good location and gives pretty good value. Was it amazing? No. Was it clean and a very good value? Yes. Would I stay again for biz? Yes. Would I go for a blow out no expense spared trip into the city? No.", "Date": "May 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "athens", "Title": "\u201cgreat location, good value, ? rooms\u201d", "Author": "cycladesfun", "ReviewID": "UR29912163", "Content": "We stayed in a room for 4 people with our two teenage boys.

The hotel itself is very old, and for how old it is...the rooms are actually not too bad. The building itself has been kept quite nice, and overall is quite clean. Room noise is bad, you can always hear people entering and leaving rooms, and street noise is pretty abundant(poor insulation I guess), but that is not a big deal...being inside Manhattan I didn't expect it to be too quiet. But my overall experience in terms of service here was quite horrible. I called ahead of time to confirm my reservation as we will be arriving late that night...everything was supposedly ok. Once we arrived however the story was different. We had 2 rooms, and one of them was supposed to be a double...but nope...it magically turned to a Single King, and apparently there was no other room available anymore. So we accepted that and would try to find another room the next day. My only requests were to be situated on a higher floor and to be away from the elevators (we booked 1 month in advance)...but nope...we got the fourth floor...and one of the rooms was right in front of the elevator. Thats when it all went downhill...our other party split with us, then got stuck in the elevator for 1.5 hours...being stuck in an elevator is acceptable since things do break down once in a while...but for 1.5 hours was pretty ridiculous, and there was very very poor communication from the outside staff letting us know what was going on. Anyways, after this fiasco, we met the only 'nice' person of our hotel stay...the evening manager...he was quite apologetic and overall very professional. Anytime we needed service at the concierge or the front desk, the staff just seemed rude and did not act like we were customers...we stayed a total of 14 days there between our 2 rooms and the only time we felt there was customer service was with the bellhop and the night service manager, everyone else was just rude. We visited the Grill inside the Hotel for breakfast...the staff there were equally unpleasant; Absolutely no service, they would just stand around and talk to each other...when we say thanks, they never would reply with a welcome or any response for that matter... Also the safe's in both rooms were not operational when we initially checked in. The business center charges you around 30cents a minute for internet with a minimum $3 charge, but the computers are so slow, you spend half the time just waiting for things to load.

The Roosevelt is a very, very good choice for a week in New York. Firstly, the location. Perfect spot just off Madison Ave. Lovely short walk to Bloomingdales, Times Square, Macy's, Central Park, Empire State Building, Rockerfella Centre, Chrysler Building. If you walk out the front of the hotel and cross the road, there is a door marked Grand Central Station. Within 2 mins you are in the main concourse. Perfect if you need trains/subway. TIP - Turn left out the main entrance on 46th Street and walk 4 blocks (past Met Life Centre on right). The Comfort Diner is a perfect place for breakfast, or lunch, or dinner! Great staff. What us English would descibe as a proper New York diner. I cannot recommend this place highly enough, and really set us up for the day. Second, the hotel and staff. If your the sort of person that gives a hotel rating a 1 star if someone doesn't say hello back to you, then you really need help! Check in was excellent. Arrived 1pm, room not ready. Stored luggage and was told to come back at 3pm. Had a drink in the bar and a local stroll in the snow and got back at 3pm. Room still not ready - BUT, I did not complain, just stayed silent for a few seconds and the lady gave us a free upgrade to a King Room. The room itself wasn't massive, so I would imagine a cozy Queen is very small, BUT it was clean, flatscreen tv, small but fine bathroom with a good shower. No complaints. The bed was excellent. TIP - if you are given a room opposite the lifts, change (as in any hotel). There are no tea/coffee facilities but there is a small coffee shop directly opposite and a Starbucks serving from the hotel bar in the morning. We avoided room service as it looked horrendously over-priced. The lobby is beautiful. It really takes you back to a grand hotel from the 30's. The bar next to the lobby is very busy, but we always found a table. WARNING - Drinks are very expensive. $15 - $20 for a cocktail and just under $10 for a pint. We had a few drinks as it was such a nice location and atmosphere, but I wouldn't advise going on an all day session unless you re-mortgaged the house before you came out. We stayed for seven nights and 2 of the nights had roadworks till past midnight....BUT I'm not going to mark a hotel down for that! Also one night had a big Jewish wedding so there was alot of corridor noise, but again only because we were near the lifts. We had no problem with the staff at all. If you feel someone deserves a tip, give them one. Never at any point did we feel pressured to tip anyone. I would recommend the hotel car back to the airport. That little bit of luxury is a perfect way to round the holiday off, and probably works out the same cost ($55) than the yellow cab ($45 + tip and tolls). The rooms were ok, but like everyone says, the only time you should spend in your room in New York is either getting ready to go out or sleeping. All in all, the hotel and location was the perfect place to spend the week in which I proposed to my girlfriend. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who was staying in New York.", "Date": "March 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Time at the Roosevelt!\u201d", "Author": "kimberleyy", "ReviewID": "UR26286468", "Content": "My mom, sister and I stayed at the Roosevelt from February 23 - March 1st and really cannot say anything negative about our experience! Our flight arrived at JFK early in the morning and we arrived at the Roosevelt before 8am. Our room was not ready for us at the time, but our luggage was happily taken care of for us and we were invited to return earlier than the regular check-in time should we choose as the front desk agent was sure our room would be ready by 1pm at the latest. I had originally booked a Cozy Queen room as part of an Expedia package as my mom and I had planned on traveling just the two of us, however when my sister decided to come, we called the hotel ahead of time and asked our room to be changed. As we had an extra person travelling with us, I fully expected to pay for the room upgrade, however we weren't charged anything! We had a great room with 2 double beds, clean bathroom and room, plenty of room for our luggage and a nice view of 46th Street. The beds were very comfortable, there was some noise outside at night from the garbage trucks working overtime to keep the streets clean, however all three of us slept very well. All but one morning we started our day by running down to the lounge in the lobby for bagels, fruit and coffee. Very conveinent, the staff were friendly, courteous, lovely. The hotel lobby was absolutely beautiful. Constantly busy as meeting and conferences were going on almost all the time. I never once felt unsafe in the hotel or the city for that matter! The hotel location is superb. With Grand Central just a block away, it's easy to get anywhere from the hotel! Also, at 47th and Madison is an excellent caf\u00e9, Caf\u00e9 Metro. Highly recommend going there for amazing soups and salads. Perfect if you want to grab some food to take back to the hotel. At no time during our entire stay did I ever feel like I had to tip anyone working at the Roosevelt. We left a few dollars everyday in the room for the maid service, and tipped the Bellmen when they retrieved our luggage for us from storage upon our arrival and when we left the hotel. The gentlemen working outside taking care of the taxi's/towncars helped us out, never implying or indicating a sense of entitlement when it came to tips.

They do ask for a $100 deposit for breakages but you get it back if no damage is done. The room we were given was on the 14th floor and the view was of some offices but we weren't bothered as we weren't there for that ! The room that greeted us was very clean, tastefully decorated and had two double beds ! One each ! The bed was soooo comfy and there was peace and quiet apart from the humming of traffic and honking of taxi horns- very NYC ! The bathroom had a decent shower/bath and they provide you with complimentary toiletries, fluffy white towels and a hair dryer ! There was cable tv and decent 37' plasma tv to watch it on. The only criticism is that there are no tea/coffee making facilities and you have to fill up a bucket of ice to keep your drinks cold - we used to buy a big carton of orange juice and stick it in the ice and that did us ! There are vending machines for fizzy drinks but I wouldn't waste the money. You can get room service but it is expensive. The Madison Bar in the hotel serves a variety of alcohol, cocktails coffee etc. Be warned it is expensive but if you are splashing out - well worth it ! Cocktails are around $15 each!

Staff seemed inured to the chaos. Concierge was very good on the other hand, knew everything about tickets, restaurants, subway etc. This is also an aircrew hotel so sometimes a couple of crews will be checking in and out in front of you. Can't imagine how frustrating it must be for them to stay here, though. Wouldn't want to stay here more than a couple of nights. If you are staying a week or so, bite the bullet and find an apartment hotel or condo for short stays. If we had to stay in that tiny room for a week my partner and I would have murdered each other probably. Bottom line: standard old NY hotel. Great location for tourists.

The room I booked was a \"cozy queen\" but we were upgraded to a king upon arrival. The room was on the 7th floor with a view of the interior (this reduced noise at night, although this is a quiet area of midtown). Our room wasn't big but all we did was sleep there. There was no coffee maker but Blake and Todds across the street had great breakfasts and coffee. The bathroom was small and the tub didn't drain well but we managed just fine. Our room wasn't cleaned on Saturday even though we were gone from 9:30 until 5:00.

There were bellmen at their desk and they watched this guy carry our bags up the stairs, offered no help and were very dismissive when he informed them that there was no bellman outside to help us. The reception staff were also dismissive, after I gave my name to check in a registration form was plonked in front of me to sign, we were handed our room key and told \"you're on the 16th floor\".......in a very bored voice.

There was no coffee maker or any extras in the room whatsoever. And it seemed like it could use a good thorough cleaning, or at least a good renovation. The concierge was helpful in helping us to plan our activities, although again he seems jaded and really didn't offer anything more than the bare limits of his job description. The brunch was tasty, but expensive so it had better be. Overall, this hotel was not a good experience for our first time to New York. I would definitely not go back.

Flat screen TV and safe, but no in-room coffee maker or robes. The age of the crown moulding was showing and the bathroom small, but over all, this was a very pleasant room. I did meet Alan when he came to make sure that I was taken care of and I showed my appreciation for his attention monitarily. He continued to be at my disposal throughout my stay, even sending up a refrigerator at no charge. The water pressure was weak, to say the least, and it took quite some time to fill the bathtub, although the shower was fine. There is no view to speak of at the hotel. The lobby bar was a nice place to have a drink and watch people move through the holiday-decorated lobby. The food was quite good, especially the enormous crab cake. Prepare for New York prices though. The staff, especially the maids, were extremely pleasant and helpful. All-in-all, I would recommend the Roosevelt.

I recently moved to upstate New York and travel to NYC fairly frequently for short stays. I have stayed at the Roosevelt several times. I have stayed with my 2 daughters as older teens /twenties , with my husband, as well as solo. Despite a few problems (which were quickly and cheerfully corrected) I gotta say I really like this hotel. It has a nice \"feel\". The lobby is wonderful in the \"grand old\" sense, the location is perfect if you are using Grand Central station for comings and goings, it is safe and friendly even for a woman traveling solo, the bar is welcoming and the bartenders know their stuff. The food is quite good at the hotel, but also good and much cheaper in the little diners, etc. throughout the city. Be aware that prices for drinks are high, as they are everywhere in New York (not just the City). Paying $10 - $12 for a cocktail or glass of wine is no biggie. I generally pay $150 - $225 US to stay here, and if I can't get a room at that price, I look elsewhere. At $150 / night a room here is a steal, even if it is of the not-as-lovely variety . At $225 / night it is still a good deal. I doubt I would pay over $275 NOT because the rooms and hotel aren't worth it, but because I know the city and where to find a better deal. Be aware that, as is the case with many hotels that have some \"history\", rooms may vary significantly in size, configuration, view, and decor, and the price does not always reflect this difference. I have stayed in a lovely, bright, large corner room with a huge bathroom and have also been assigned a less lovely, somewhat dark room...and paid essentially the same price. have had occasional problems with the rooms- once I was assigned a room with a poorly functioning air conditioner and another time the room was unacceptable due to conditions others have cited, however, I am impressed by the response of the staff in quickly, and without argument, assigning me a different room.

It is in a good location and easy to get hold of taxis, buses and subways. When we arrived about midday our room wasn't ready, we were told we were 24th in line for a room. There was no problem leaving our cases with the porter while we went out to explore, and our room was ready when we got back; they had told us to come back in a couple of hours and we did. There was no problem, either, looking after our cases when we checked out too because we didn't leave New York until much later in the day. We booked a CozyQueen, but when I told them it was our anniversary (true!) they upgraded us to a room with a king-size bed on the 6th floor. It was a nice good size room with an unspectacular view from the window. The weather was hot (low 70's in October!) and the air-conditioning was noisey. The choice was to have it on and be kept awake or turn it off and be baking hot. You could switch it on Low or High but both settings were noisey. The room was a good size and so was the bathroom. A small complaint about the bathroom was that the basin had a large crack in it, which didn't make it very hygenic. Also there was mold growing on the grouting of a few of the tiles around the bath, and the bath itself seemed to be pockmarked. Nothing very much to complain about, but the room wasn't cheap and I would expect better. We had good water pressure, but I overheard another guest in the lift say that on their floor higher up there was practically no pressure. The hotel did announce they were turning off the hot water for some maintenance during the day so that could have been part of the reason. The hotel has a Business Centre where you can use the Internet, but at a price. It was USD10.00 for 30 minutes or you could use it with a credit card where the minimum charge was USD3.00.

From the 16th to the 23rd of December last year my partner and I stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel NYC. Entering the hotel is like entering the set of a romantic movie. As you walk up the staircase into the lobby you are greeted by a beautifully decorated Christmas tree and a host of friendly staff and guests. The whole atmosphere sent butterflies to my stomach. I had looked forward to this trip so much, I was afraid encase I had set my expectations too high and was almost anticipating an anticlimax, but to my delight it was everything I had hoped it would be and more. After an extremely quick check in, (I mean literally 1 min), we made our way to the lift to take us to our new home for the week. Again there was a lovely surprise for us as we waited for the lift, some complimentary egg nog to further intensive the Christmas spirit. As we ascended to our room I could not have felt happier or more excited about the forthcoming week. This was most definitely not going to be any ordinary trip. I can honestly say I\u2019ve never been so far away from home and yet, felt so at home, (if that makes sense). We had booked to stay in the petite room and it was exactly that, however it was more than comfortable and the way in which the cleaning staff made up the rooms each day is to be highly commended. Every single day without fail, we were equipped with new towels and toiletries and the beds were always made to perfection, and that was in addition to the friendliness and politeness of the staff. In this review I must also mention the time and effort that the staff at the front desk put in to making our stay as enjoyable and fun packed as possible. We never felt lost. There was always a smiley face wanting to help, from Broadway tickets to the most time efficient ways of sight seeing, because let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s NY and there is almost too much to do. By the end of the week we were almost experts of where to go and what to see. MOST IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT TAKE THE BLUE SHUTTLE BUS!!!!!!!!!!!! We booked out tickets in advance and the service they provided was adequate from the airport to the hotel; however the more important trip, getting us to the airport in time for our flight home was disastrous!!!!!!! The disastrous part being that they didn\u2019t turn up. We booked our bus an hour earlier than we needed to just encase anything should happen and I\u2019m so glad we did. Our panic was short lived however, as you guessed it, lol, the Roosevelt staff came to the rescue and offered us the hotel car to take us to the airport. It was actually the door staff who sorted this problem for us. Although I don\u2019t know the man\u2019s name he really was a gentleman and did everything in his power to help us. He is a credit to that hotel. We did have to pay for the car but it was only $70 to Newark and when the average taxi is $50 and it meant we didn\u2019t miss our flight I thought this was more than reasonable. The car was most comfortable and it was the perfect end to a most memorable and romantic holiday.

In the end I decided you can't be influenced too much by someone's bad experience, so I decided to book the Roosevelt despite having some concerns about the reviews about theft from the rooms. The reasons for choosing it were general central location, proximity to Grand Central Station, right sort of price range and size, and availability on the nights I wanted. Basically we had a great week there with no problems at all. We arrived too early for check in (1pm) but they did check us in no problem. The room was absolutely fine - two nice big comfortable beds. Air conditioning and safe worked fine, so did toilet and the shower was brilliant. Maybe not much space to hang stuff up or spread out cases but that is minor quibble. I'm pleased to say suffered no thefts or other problems. It was quiet, room cleaning fine, very little contact with other guests or staff so very much a 'hands off' feeling to it, especially when we took to getting the elevator from the lower Arcade level. Elevators were busy but no particularly long waits. The shop was useful for drinks for the night and was open late, also you could get ice from a machine to keep your drinks cool in. We never tried the breakfast in the end but had one evening meal in the restaurant behind the lobby - food was perfectly okay, I had a 'New York Strip' steak and New York cheesecake. Overall I would say our stay was a great success and I enjoyed it, and would definitely recommend it, however seeing other people's gripes about bad service etc I think the conclusion is that there's an element of luck involved in whether you have a good experience or not.

Supposed to be a 4/5 star hotel but it was dreadful. When we arrived the bell boys grab your bags climb 3 steps (not even to the recetion) and hands out for a tip! Not a good start! When we got to the reception desk I was told there was a 3hour wait for our room because of a staffing problem, When we explained that I had a migraine there was no interest - not even an offer of a glass of water! Eventually got to our room which was right next to the lift - just what you need with a migraine and the thought of putting up with the noise all week was too much so my husband went to the recetion to request another room. After speaking to 3 different people and argueing politely we were offered another room. On arrival to this one, the toilet was broken, electrics were hanging out of the wall and the air con worked only in a very noisy fashion. So another trip downstairs - by this time I felt absolutely dreadful and so husband went again to reception and got pretty stroppy. The 3rd room we were offered was only adequate - if you could ignore the grubby carpet, bubbling plastic in the bathroom, next to the cleaners cupboard and overlooking the back vents of the hotel kitchens! But it was clean! The website looks amazing - the reception certainly is really impressive but it would seem that once you are pased the hallowed grounds of recetion the rooms have another life! Given that we viewed 3 on our visit, I would guess that we were past just being 'unlucky' in choice of rooms. Most of the staff were unhelpful - to the point of being downright rude but the housekeepers were always pleasant and seemed to do a good surface job. Conseirge were great too and really helpful. Maybe the managers need to look to them for some customer relations training! We left a letter of complaint but got no reply. We emailed a letter of complaint upon our return - and got no reply. Then they sent a customer satisfaction survery (what a laugh) to which we replied very negetivly - but still no reply. We got an email to say that since we had posted negetive feedback they would be in touch - we are still waiting! The best laugh is that they still send me emails inviting us to 'visit again soon'!!!

The hotel is in a good location (near Grand Central, NY Public library, 5th Avenue - good shops and about a 10 min walk to times square). As we are from England, we were not used to the hot climate, fortunately taxis were relatively cheap to get around. Checking in was quite simple although the receptionist was very unpleasant - he tossed our key across the desk and had a bad attitude. Additionally, the safe in our room was broken, but after calling security this was fixed promptly and the security guy also gave us free breakfast! (We were on a room only basis - breakfast is quite good but I would probably get sick of it everyday - we usually just went to cafes - cafe metro is quite good for breakfast and only about $5.) Additionally the hair dryer was broke in the room and this was never repaired. The cleaning service was quite good and the maids were friendly and actually took notice of the 'do not disturb' sign - this is quite often ignored in other hotels I have stayed in. The hotel rooms were average, we stayed in a 'petite room', 'petite' being true. The room included a large plasma TV with quite a few good channels - movie channels, MTV, BBC etc, and ironing facilities etc. You should also look into the cheapest way of getting to the hotel from the airport, from JFK we got ripped off and ended up paying $90 when the guy had told us it would cost $50. Another man running his private taxi business practically ran away with my suitcase in an attempt to rip us off. Yellowcabs are usually quite cheap for getting around so I'd probably suggest that. Another thing, is EVERYONE expects you to tip them, coming from a country were tipping is not often necessary I found this strange - one guy who gave us a piece of paper with how much luggage we had loitered round for a few minutes until we gave him some dollars, additionally restaurants sometimes add this onto your bill or state that 15-20% is sufficient. Points of interest I would recommend would be to see a Broadway show (we saw Mamma Mia which was excellent and funny), Statue of liberty, Empire state building (good view at night and that is when ques are shorter) top of the rockerfeller centre is good through the day as you get a great view of central park. Central park is a lovely place too and we spent a nice day just walking round, visited strawberry fields and went on the rowing boats near the boathouse. Restaurants I would recommend are Tavern on the Green in central park (outdoor and pretty with lanterns and live music, nice to end the night on a horse and carriage ride which is from $40), Ellen's stardust diner near the theatres in Times Square is quite good for younger people too, this is where all of the waitresses are trying to make it on broadway and serve and sing - the food isn't that good but it's a different experience and a lot of the child customers enjoyed it. Overall I would recommend the Roosevelt and I would definitely return.

LOCATION- Perfect for Midtown at 45th and Madison. I think it's a great location. There are plenty of restaurants around and all the transportation is close. Bryant Park (my favorite spot in NYC) is just about 5 blocks away. LOBBY- When you arrive you are almost blow away by the stately beauty of the lobby and public areas. Almost stunning. It's been beautifully restored. ROOMS- Mine was tiny indeed. Actually it was so tiny there wasn't even a desk for my laptop. But hey this is NYC. The bedding is comfortable with nice linens and pillows. There was also a great flat-screen television. Okay, so far I have only stated the positives..... Well, this is one of those hotels that LOOKS and SEEMS great at first glance. And really for all practical purposes, it's OK....... However, if they don't start to keep this place up, it's going to be nothing more than a run-down tourist hotel within another 10 or 15 years. Here's my list: -Old slow evelators (need to me modernized) -Almost ever door on my hallway had scuff marks and dirt on them. This shows a real lack of attention to cleaning. -Major scuff mark on the bedskirt in my room. -Many, many spots in the hallway carpet with rips and stains. -HORRIBE bathroom plumbing. The toilet would not flush properly due to insifficient pressure. The shower was one of the worst I have ever had. Did not take one OK shower. Once it was scalding hot, and twice ice cold. No in-between temps - even after I spend 10-15 minutes playing with it. -Staff that wasn't into their jobs at all. As an exmple, once on a packed elevator, a bellhop counted all his money while riding instead of smiling or making eye contact with guests. -Security was a bit lacking. At night, they have the evelator bank was \"roped off\" however twice no one ever asked to see my room key. If you get a good deal on the place, I say go for it.

One thing to note: the rooms are really a crap shoot. Personally, I like the charm of a hotel where the rooms are not all the same cookie cutter shape and size. But I admit that some of the rooms at the Roosevelt are small and feel cramped. I also know that some of the bathrooms have stall showers with only a small lip separating them from the rest of the bathroom, though I have never had anything but a tub with shower in the bathroom. The one time I have had a problem with my room was when I was given one on the third floor, which should be non-smoking, yet my room reeked of cigarette smoke. I think it might have been because I was on a low floor, some of the odor might have come up from the street. At any rate, I requested a different room on a higher floor and they accommodated me right away. Within the last few months they have added nice flat screen TV's to all the rooms. The carpet could really stand to be replaced in most areas of the hallways and guest rooms, but it's not really bothersome. Room service is usually prompt and professional, and the same goes for the staff in the lounge downstairs.

Let start off from the beginning, I had booked two doubles as I was taking my nephew on this trip for a graduation present. I had called the hotel in the morning to notify them that I would be checking in late due to a late flight. We got to the hotel around midnight and I was told that there were no double available and that we could have a queen. I explained to them that this was in unacceptable and they said they couldn\u2019t do anything to accommodate us. We asked for a rollaway bed, however that wouldn\u2019t work due to the room being so small. I checked back the following morning and night and they still claimed that there was nothing available. We requested additional bedding and my nephew slept on the floor the first two nights. They finally were able to move us to our two double on our last night there. Both rooms were very tiny, but very clean. I thought that the painting and carpet could be updated, but it really wasn\u2019t that bothersome. Our first room was a handicap room and the shower was awful, we got the entire bathroom wet and water also went out into the room because of the drains not working properly. The bathroom was much better in the second room. I thought the beds were very comfortable and were much needed after walking in the heat all day. The pillows were very stiff and not to comfortable. Each of the rooms had a great flat screen. The noise from the street below could be heard very easily, however that wasn\u2019t too big of deal to me as we were so tired from being on the go all day and I fell asleep in spite of the noise.

The entrance area to the floor was clean and tidy, if not ever so slightly out of date on decor. The room itself was very nice, not particularly huge, but very comfortable. My Mum had ungraded our room to a Superior room, which meant we had a Large double bed each, with various other upgraded amenities. Bathroom was basic, but clean, which is all we could have asked for. We were supplied with a safe in the wardrobe, which could not be moved and set to lock with your own personalised code. We kept our cash in here, as well as passports, as it seemed very secure. Location wise, the Roosevelt is quite central. Grand Central Station is right around the corner and the Empire State is around a 15 minute walk DownTown. In the opposite direction its around a 15 minute walk to Time Square, but taxi's are easy to come by. The Doormen at the front of the hotel are more than happy to flag you one down. On the second night, very tired after a busy day sightseeing, we decided to have dinner in the hotel bar, followed by a few cocktails. The food was fresh and tasty, but a little expensive. Cocktails were large, as my Mum soon realised when she passed out on one of the beds after having just one!! There is a fantastic deli opposite the hotel, which do a great selection of breakfasts, I would strongly suggest anyone visiting the Roosevelt go there. Generally this was a pleasant and well located hotel, with friendly staff. I would most definately go back to the Roosevelt again.", "Date": "July 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ashby de la Zouch, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWhat a trip!!\u201d", "Author": "Allaboutmyhols", "ReviewID": "UR17502076", "Content": "Can well recommend this hotel.

During the next two days, we continuously contacted several managers, who shifted the responsibility of dealing with our concern to other managers. We were promised calls back to address the problem, and were disappointed, but albeit not shocked at this point, that no one returned our calls. Additionally, the bath did not run hot water. After approximately 20-25 minutes of having the water temperature in the tub set on the maximum heat level, we were able to have some lukewarm water. The Roosevelt's solution to this problem? Sending a technician to our room well after our showers were over. If a dirty toilet and cold water in the shower weren't enough, the television only had a handful of channels that showed a clear picture, while the remaining channels were scrambled.

On a practical note, the lifts did not appear to cater for the number of guests.

Overall, the room was cozy with classic furnishings. The bed was a bit cosy for two women sharing so would recommend a king for a male/female couple --especially if one person is larger or taller. The washroom was small but adequate. Restaurant was generally good. I would suggest going off site and paying the same amount for a more complete meal. There are plenty of good eats in other areas that it seems a shame to not leave the restaurant. We arranged a town car to take us from La Guardia.

Hindsight, I should have seen this coming. The first of many issues my family encountered, getting a hold of reservations. Most reputable hotels have reservations available 24/7. Not this one. In fact unless you're non-working individual, you're stuck with an 8am-5pm work day for their reservations counter. After finally getting a hold of them, I signed up for a weekend in February for my family (wife, daughter, and myself). At the time I also signed up for a crib. Two months later and a week before our arrival in NYC, I call to confirm the hotel room. Guess what? No notes confirming a crib. The receptionist was quite nice on the telephone, apologized, and told me directly that she has placed the note on the screen. Alas, our arrival in NYC was here. We checked into the hotel. I must say, the hotel was buzzing. It had a beautiful lobby, excellent doormen, and a good check-in feel. That was about the highlight of our stay (besides checking out). Let me explain to you about this stay -- it's a \"historic\" hotel. That's a code word for \"old.\" In fact, it's very historic. The elevators are HORRIBLE. In fact, if you go to this hotel, either pick a floor that you can take the stairs, or get a room in the top part of the hotel where you can actually get on an elevator going down. We would wait for 30-45 minutes in order to get an elevator going down. We finally gave up and pressed the up button to up to the top and then grab the elevator down. The view of the room stunk. After all it's NYC, right? Hotels are meant to be vacant because you are \"in the city\" all day long. Wrong. There are reasons why there are no pictures on the hotel's web site that show the great view -- there is not unless you want to look at brick buildings. About the accommodation: we could barely move around the room (see the pictures). The noise level was horrendous -- thin walls as well as thin windows meaning you will need to use the climate system, which by the way is antiquated and super noisy as the pipes clang constantly. With the sirens coming up from the street as well as the air condition unit right outside of our room, it made for the stereotypical sounds of NYC. If you're looking for sleep in this hotel, forget it. If you're travel with kids, STAY AWAY. Turns out they ran out of cribs. Indeed, I had to call room service three times to ask where was the crib. By the end of the fourth phone call, I received a response in 10 minutes -- a bellman brining me a pack and play apologizing that they ran out of cribs. Guess I should have made my reservations 6 months ago vs. the 2 months I originally set. So let's talk about the bathroom...mold. Mold. And Mold. In fact, I contacted room service to have the bathroom cleaned while we went to dinner to recoup our disbelief of this supposedly nice hotel. Even after the cleaning, it still looks moldy (see photo). Then there was the tub. The showerhead pressure was fantastic, if you could close your eyes and pretend the showerhead wasn't plagued with microbes of bacteria. However, even that was overcome by the shower drain being unable to keep up with the water flow. So if you're going to this hotel, be prepared to shower wading in dirty water to your shins. As parents, we got no sleep for 4 days. Our child was miserable. As we left the hotel room and thought to ourselves, thank goodness, even their self-checkout on their new flat screens wasn't working. The sheet says to tune your tv to channel 42. When you do that the screen says the channel doesn't exist. The icing on the cake. As we left the hotel behind, we did encounter one more nice thing, the doorman. If you happen to need directions or someone to hail a cab for you, ask for Bernard, he was great. If you have a family, I would not recommend this hotel. If you're traveling with your significant other, I would caution you to stay only if you're interested in not staying in and merely using it for just a bed. I hope our horrible experience is not lived out by anyone else. That's why I'm taking the time to write this review.

The hotels in Manhattan were at their lowest prices, and I selected the Roosevelt.

I really loved going through Grand Central several times. The Roosevelt has a beautiful lobby, but every time I might have wanted to sit and enjoy it, the seating was all occupied. There is a set of 6 elevators, and I never had to wait more than a couple minutes to get an elevator on my floor. The rooms were quite toasty, as I've seen mentioned in other reviews, but I counteracted that with the A/C when I was getting dressed after a shower. My room was 1687, a \"cozy queen\". The room was quite small but just right for me and my luggage. The bathroom was miniature sized--but again it worked for one traveler. The walls were quite thin--I could hear a neighbor's phone conversation and mild coughing. Also, since the room was so small, the bed is obviously very near the door, so you could hear everything housekeeping was doing. You have to really concentrate to recognize whether they are knocking on your door or someone else's. I had my Do Not Disturb sign out, which they respected. The linens were nice and the bed was quite comfortable. They provided Bath & Body Works toiletries, which were nice. Some of the towels have seen better days, but again since I was alone I could avoid those towels and use the others. I had a non-smoking room which was a true non-smoking room (didn't smell like smoke anyway like many I've experienced at other hotels).

The Old World lobby was absolutely stunning. Shame the bar prices ($9 for a gin & tonic) seemed rather expensive. The desk staff were friendly enough but the first lady put the 3 of us in what must have been a standard room with a King bed on the 17th floor. We'd requested a twin double room but they didn't have any left apparently. We were told to bring our luggage down the next morning and the desk would find us a twin double room. The King room was small already and with a rollaway bed taking up what was left of the floor space it was very cramped. We also couldn't find any air-conditioning unit and it was too cold to open the window so suffered with no ventilation. This is the room in the photos. The next morning we asked again at the desk and was told that we could have a twin double room, but that there would be no room for a cot. When we protested, the lady was apologetic about her colleague's mistake and offered to show us the twin double room for size if we wanted to. We relented and she gave us another King room on a lower floor. This room though was extremely large and spacious compared to the previous one. The rollaway bed fitted with heaps of extra room. Lesson learnt? Ask for a larger room if they have one available. This one was on the 6th floor. Oh, and this room had an air-conditioning unit located underneath the window. Bathrooms in both rooms were clean and functional. Windows let in a bit of traffic noise but didn't pose any problem for sleeping. Watch the linen as I found a couple of stains on the edges of the sheets but otherwise there were no complaints from the girls. Beds were comfortable enough. Concierge was functional, but not very friendly. When I asked him for a restaurant recommendation he kept looking around at anyone but me when talking to me, and was distracted mid-sentence by something his colleague was doing. Perhaps I didn't look like I was going to give him a big tip (which I wouldn't have minded doing if he actually did his job well). The best thing about the Roosevelt though is the location. It's two blocks from 5th Avenue, and the walk up 5th Avenue to the Apple Store at 5th Av and 58th St is littered with lots of great shopping. It's two blocks from Grand Central Terminal where you can catch trains and subways to all parts of Manhattan. It's about 3 blocks to Times Square and Broadway. It's just around the corner from all the expensive hotels on Park street. Walking to and from the hotel at night was no problem and the girls never felt threatened. I'd advise this hotel for people wanting looking for an affordable hotel for serious shopping or sightseeing in New York with its great location and easy access to trains and the subway.

Based on other reviews, I expected the room to be tiny, and it was. It was well-equipped, as expected. However, * I've had bigger bathrooms on cruise ships! Seriously! The bathroom door bumped on the toilet when it was open so you couldn't open the bathroom door completely. * The room was so hot in January that I had to open the screen-less window (on the 18th floor!) to let in cool air (and city noises) and keep the A/C on HIGH every night, sleeping only with the sheet over me. Yet they wanted me to help them \"conserve energy\" by re-using the towels and washcloths? Conserve more energy by cutting down on all that heat! Wow! * Limited electrical outlets - one outlet in the bathroom and one on the desk lamp in the bedroom. That was it. So, could not charge the cell phone and charge/use the computer at the same time in the same room. * Internet access through a 3rd party was $15/day (24 hour period) added on to the bill. * Internet access was provided through the typical VERY short ethernet cable. So, to use it, I had to keep my computer on the desk while I sat in the unadjustable desk chair, which was very low, catching up on e-mail and everything else with my elbows above my ears. ARRGH! Not good! Is ethernet really so expensive that they can't afford to put 36 inches of it in each room? Wireless would be even better, of course, and so would FREE!!! * The key card malfunctioned on me the first time I tried to get back into the room. Since my room was on the 18th floor, I tried using the hall phone to get another key sent up. NO luck. The voice answering directed me back down to the lobby where there was a long line. The person who checked me in quickly made me a new card, apologized, and suggested that next time I use the house phone on the floor. Yea, right.... So, keep the card away from your cell phone, your computer, or anything else vaguely electronic. * The safe in the room did not work because the pins that lock the door were too short to connect! Waste of space! * I'm a woman traveling alone, and I'm security conscious. For this hotel, access to the elevators leading to ALL the floors of the hotel were accessible from the lower level of the hotel, where a bunch of street-level stores are located. Plenty of access from the street to the elevator bank - from the stores and also directly from the street. So, anyone walking into the hotel on that level has unfettered access to the elevators and all the hotel rooms. No one watching those elevators at all (perhaps a security camera, but no one stopping foot traffic was visible). Those street doors are locked after 9 p.m. and the stores are closed then, too, but NOT a warm and comfy feeling for me. Last point - The hotel has room service, but I think I figured that a scrambled egg and toast breakfast was going to cost me $50, and the hotel breakfast buffet was excellent but $40/person, too. The bar/coffee shop has good coffee, and some breakfast items, but very pricy. Perhaps normal for NYC, but wow!

It was sometimes very cosy - sometimes downright stressful - with the kids. Anyway, here are my accommodation reviews. I\u2019ll mention side trips and tours too. Sometimes the accommodation was arranged through a travel agent, but on a couple of occasions I organised it direct. We spent 5 nights at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York, including New Years Eve. This accommodation was arranged through a travel agent (after satisfying ourselves on Trip Advisor), who recommended that we book early in the year, for accommodation goes quickly in the Big Apple on New Years Eve, as it does in any city (ie, people booking hotel rooms just for the night). We had two rooms - a double and a triple, which were unfortunately on separate floors. Ours had a king-sized bed, wardrobe, safe, TV, drawers, desk and chair ($15.00 a day internet access via ethernet cable; slightly cheaper for more than 1 day packages, but the most expensive that I\u2019d seen in the USA) and a reasonably-sized bathroom (shower/bath). The kids\u2019 triple room was much the same, but with 2 double beds. The hotel itself is a wonderful old building with a majestic foyer. It\u2019s big - we seemed to walk for miles just to get to our room, which looked up at the Metlife Building (formerly the Pan Am Building). They served free eggnog in the foyer as part of the Christmas theme. It\u2019s location is quite central to Manhattan - minutes from Grand Central Terminal (and subway), close to such icons as St Patricks Cathedral and the New York Public Library, and easy walking distance to Times Square and 5th Avenue shops. Like most big cities, you will never get a hotel in NY that is convenient to everything. But as mentioned, the subway was nearby, and this is the best way to cheaply get around the longer distances (get a multi-journey ticket - dispatched by vending machines using a credit card on subway stations). As for tours, we got our money\u2019s worth from a City Pass (valid for 9 days to see 6 attractions), and it saved us time when queuing for the Empire State Building. The City Pass included a boat cruise (Hudson River, Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, and the East River under the Brooklyn Bridge) which was well worth it. [Hint - trade your travel agent\u2019s voucher for the book of City Pass tickets at a less popular attraction, where the queues are shorter. For instance, at the Empire State Building, there\u2019s a huge queue to get your City Pass, then you\u2019ll have to join the back of the queue for the building itself.] The Gray Line hop-on hop-off loops (open top double-decker buses) were good too (both of these were purchased through the travel agent before we left). We also did an awesome helicopter ride over Manhattan through Liberty Helicopters (the chopper takes 7 passengers plus the pilot) on Christmas Day, but that, as you can imagine, was hellishly expensive. The Empire State Building is a must, but I\u2019d recommend the Top of the Rock too (the viewing decks at the top of the Rockefeller Centre). From there, you get a much better view of Central Park, plus you look south over Manhattan and see the Empire State Building too (which you can\u2019t do when you\u2019re atop it!). The big bonus is that, whilst it took about 2 hours to get to the top of the Empire State Building, there was virtually no wait to get to the Top of the Rock. We went mid-afternoon, and I stayed until the evening to get the sunset and night photos. See my review of the Beacon hotel in New York for photos of these tours. New Years Eve was spent at the Renaissance Hotel\u2019s restaurant overlooking Times Square, and this was simply awesome (and deserving of a separate entry on Trip Advisor). The venue was unsurpassable (but as you can imagine, it came at a cost!).

The location was fabulous. It is a block from Grand Central Station and a few blocks from Times Square if you are a tourist or if you need a west bound metro. You are on the corner of Madison and 45th so shopping is as soon as you walk out the door. Our room was spacious for New York standards with 2 double beds.

All of the staff was helpful and friendly except one older gentleman concierge who recommended Serendipity for dessert...which had been shuttered recently and had re-opened.

When I got to my room I was a little disappointed that it was barely large enough to hold the bed. I was going to be working 11 hour days and so I wasn't that concerned with the size, up till then I was still ok. Then I ordered room service. BIG mistake. I am accustomed to expensive room service I realize I'm paying for convenience. The food was horrible. Beyond horrible and that is not easy to say about a cheeseburger. So I thought maybe just a bad night and ordered breakfast in the morning. OUCH even worse. So off I was to stand on marble floors for 11 hours. I came back to 5 messages on my phone saying that all of the water would be turned off at 11pm until 5am the next day and then let it run until it is not brown anymore. The message went on to say that there would be complimentary bottled water for the guests. Ok I know at this point anyone reading this will wonder why I ordered room service again, well I don't know the city well and there is nowhere to dine around the hotel. So I ordered again and asked for 5 bottles of water to last through the night. When the food got there I realized they charged me $10 a bottle for water. The man that delivered it was very nice and agreed that this was ridiculous he called the room service manager to the phone. This woman along with the next 3 people I spoke to on the phone that were managers in some capacity told me that EACH GUEST IS ONLY ALLOWED ONE BOTTLE EACH THAT THEY MUST GET THEMSELVES FROM THE FRONT DESK. Needless to say I was furious at this point and finally spoke to a manager named Joe Britt who proceeded to yell at me and say \"for the record\" before each sentence like \"I am not asking you to leave this hotel\" the conversation was pretty much one sided with him yelling over me his \"For the record\" speech. After a half hour of this nonsense he finally agreed to let me have 3 bottles and if I needed anymore I could call him in the middle of the night to bring them. As if this was not bad enough I got bitten all over my chest and woke up with itchy bumps. After running the water clear I was able to shower the next morning but the day after when I got ready to leave for the airport I was in the shower looked down and realized the water was completely brown.

When somebody finally came at midnight, he brought a bunch of white sheets, but didn't know how to put them on the bed. They were all untucked and crooked on the bed. He also didn't bother to clean the bathroom, vacuum, or give us any new towels. 2. Secondly, the bathroom was very cramped for any American hotel, even one that is two or three stars. You can barely stand in it with your significant other at the same time. The floor and shower tiles were moldy, and the toilet clogged easily. I've never clogged a hotel toilet before, but this one seemed very delicate. 3. The t.v. was this tiny tube thing you could barely see from the bed. 4. The internet service didn't work for the two days that we were there. We spent over an hour each day troubleshooting with their off-site IT service trying to figure out why it would come on and off. The hotel tried to tell us that our (new) Mac laptop was the problem, but oddly enough we were able to surf the web at any other hotel and other areas with Ethernet cables or free WiFi. In the end, the hotel still charged us for two days of internet service even though it wasn't working for more than about 30 minutes each of those days. 5. There are prostitutes waiting outside the front doors. We saw one of them counting a stack of twenty dollar bills at the elevator on our floor. She also looked as if she had just taken drugs. After the awful time we had there for a day and a half, we couldn't stand sleeping there another night and so left at midnight on the second night to go to the Parker Meridien.

I was a bit disturbed over the weeks leading up to the trip as a number of the reviews at the time were less than complimentary, but I think if you put the effort in to speaking to the hotels reservations team direct, many of the problems could be avoided. We booked a deluxe room and from the hotel website it was clear that there were options, so I picked up the phone. Q \"Room size varies from 200 300 square feet. How do I get a 300 foot one?\" A \"Easy you need a corner room.\" Q \"I want it quiet\" A \" No problem, above the 14th floor then.\" Q \"What about a view?\" A \"No problem, quiet view at the side or less so on Madison? A \"Quiet view I think \" A \"No problem - 45th.\" So when we arrived we had exactly what we asked for, a quiet, corner room on the 15th floor with a side view. Easy. The room was a nice size, bright, with all the normal furniture and two large lounge arm chairs. Just right. The bed was mega comfy. Maid service every day and the bed turned down with little chocolates on the pillow. Nice touch. Okay a few things. The bathroom was small by European standards. Shower, hand basin and loo, no bath or bidet. But it was clean and worked. There were no tea / coffee making facilities in the room, which was a bit of a pain. We made do with water and juice in the end. The room was hot without the heating on so we left it off. The air con worked fine, but wasn't needed. The hotel public areas were warm. Several people felt a little uncomfortable and commented about it. It was fine in shirt sleeves though. The lobby/ main reception was really nice. Very festive. Plenty of helpful staff, a Starbucks concession and a nice lounge and bar area. Quite pricey though. The restaurant was acceptable. We only ate there Christmas day, but the food was fine and not a crazy price. Breakfast, however was a crazy price ($28pp) and try as I might I couldn't get it included in any deal, so we ate out every morning in one of the myriad of little breakfast places there are around the hotel. Easy, clean and cheap. Loads of choice. Not an issue and good fun actually. This is a big hotel and so the lobby area is constantly busy, but it never felt packed. Just don't expect the staff to know your name like you often get in European hotels, it's not going to happen. Going back to JFK we were offered the hotel car, which was a nice relaxed, clean journey and cost $55 (about the same as a taxi, but much nicer.) All in all the hotel was great and added to the experience. It's in a great central Midtown location and with Grand Central on the corner you can get around easily. It's got character so if your looking for something crisp and modern book into a Marriott or Holiday Inn. Couple of tips: Call the hotel and make your booking direct. They have a price match system so you can't lose out and you will stand a good chance of getting your requirements better met. Don't take the bus from the airport. It takes 2 hours; It stops up the road from Grand Central Station where you are meant to be met by a smaller shuttle bus to take you to your hotel, but you can end up walking the last bit instead. We did. Only a couple of minutes, but not fun with a bunch of suitcases. Taxi is $45 plus tolls and tip and goes right to the door.

The hotel is older and looks dated. The breakfast was a buffett and we found a long black hair in the omelet!! Also the male servers were not attentive and ignored requests for water and juice. The elevators are unbelievably slow! Many aircrew stay here and they all were taking the service elevator in order to make their flights. We waited 20 mins for an elevator going down although there are 7 bays. We were informed this is the way it is ..

Traditional in style and sympathetically renovated. Rooms are very clean. Bathroom basic but everything you need and the hair dryer in the bathroom is very impressive. The hotel is perfectly located for everything you want to do. On our 2nd day there they put the Christmas tree up and decorations and it did look beautiful. There are just a couple of things I would point out. I stayed there with my 21 year old daughter. We checked in on the Friday afternoon and were impressed enough by our room. We set out for the City and arrived back around midnight and tucked ourselves up into bed to get ready for a full day sightseeing. We were rudely woken 3 times in the night by people passing our room and being loud then giggly. On looking through the spyhole I realised that it was teenagers. I rang down to reception on 2 occasions for security to ask them to calm down and remain in their rooms. Unfortunately this did not work and we had to confront them ourselves. In the end I naturally was concerned about any further incidents that I phoned reception and asked to be moved. Sure enough, not a problem, We were transferred from the 3rd to the 14th floor within half an hour (it was 5.30am by then). Our second room was actually slightly nicer than our first, but they were both superior rooms. When I spoke to the receptionist later that morning she explained that they sometimes book in students from schools and do have problems with them from time to time, that they are not responsible for their behaviour, that is down to their teachers. I feel that this is inappropriate for this hotel to accommodate students in this way as it is not a cheap hotel and their behaviour certainly spoilt our first night sleep. The second night we were woken at about 2am by 2 drunken Irishmen in the room next door who had the TV on loud and were shouting above it!! I do recommend the hotel but on booking (1) ask for a room away from the elevator as you can hear the 'ping' every time it arrives on your floor and people don't always lower their voices when stepping out. (2) double check that you have no students on your floor. (3) the walls are a little thin and you can hear the next rooms TV and hear them talking! On the whole it was a lovely hotel. The staff are a bit hot and cold, some are a bit stuffy and find it difficult to smile and some are extremely helpful. Particularly the bellboys. One thing I would ask all travellers is that when you are in a hotel, just to consider who is in the next room, they may not want to hear your TV.", "Date": "November 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "skitty31", "Title": "\u201cHad a lovely stay, recommended.\u201d", "Author": "skitty31", "ReviewID": "UR11092654", "Content": "Right, just to be clear, we unlike others use hotels for holidays and breaks, we don't travel for business, so based on my experience of hotels and not comparing or judging the star rating as not that experienced.

Reception were very polite and upgraded from queen room to king size, we didn't ask, was just done for us which we were very impressed with. Room was a nice size with a king size very comfortable bed, room and bathroom was spotless, if you want to be really picky, the cleaners could use the hose on the vacuum cleaner as the edges of the carpet was a bit dusty, but that would be very picky!!! Shower was great, powerful and very clean, towels and sheets were changed every day and left spotless. Tv had a nice amount of free channels, not a flatscreen but room was for sleeping as we were out 90% of the time. Only gripes really were, the heating was hard to get right, either very hot or under average which was a bit cold, so you either choose sweaty or chilly!!!!! may have been our heater. Other problem was the bar, very arrogant head bar person, lovely bowl of nuts with every visit, but drinks were expensive, $8 for a bottle of beer and food was expensive, my advise would be to eat out cheaper and of same quality. Head barman seemed to swan around like a peacock, not seeming to awknowledge you speaking to him, but returning with your request eventually.

The good, the bad and the just plain nasty: 1. The location is great: blocks from Grand Central Station, Times Square, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Fab Fifth Avenue shopping (Cartier! Saks! Prada!) and the skating rink at Rockefeller Center. I liked being able to fall out the door, walk a few blocks and see some sights. 2. The room: Way small. a large red stain on the carpet. (yuck) Rips in the sheet. Stained chair. Even a small yellow stain on the little decorative pillow with the \"R\" on it. Nasty. Although the room itself was clean, and the bathroom was clean. Go NYC maids, who do a commendable job even though management refuses to spring for new linens and won't upgrade the carpet. (Note to management: you have a historic property here. Treat it and your guests with respect and spend the money. It would have a nice feel to it, rather than appearing like a drunk dowager who woke up the next morning wearing a strand of pearls and a smudge of mascara and torn stockings.) 3. The staff is welcoming. The concierge recommended the Hudson Hotel for dinner, and didn't steer us wrong. (cool hotel, the Hudson, although pricier). Thank you! 4. This is a huge hotel, with 1,000 or so rooms, and while it gives the lovely lobby a festive feel (all those people mingling, heading for the bar) you don't get the service you would get in a boutique hotel. 5. Nine dollars for a Corona beer? I tipped the bartender a buck. Okay, I'm from Boston, but that's the first time I spent ten bucks for a mass market beer. (Obviously I don't visit NYC often enough:) 6. The breakfast buffet was nicely presented. I liked the made -to-order omelets and my kids enjoyed making yogurt, berry granola parfaits and toasting their own bagels. Next to the beer, the $85.00 I paid for three of us (one at a child's rate) for the buffet breakfast was practically a steal. 7.The reservation. Completely messed up. We didn't get what we asked for, and when I was checking out, a gentleman at the desk was also complaining about a reservations issue. 8. The lobby area and the bar are quite lovely. In the morning they have starbucks/bagels/fruit served in the bar area, which is convenient. 9. Many Europeans taking advantage of the sad, sad state of the dollar. A number of our friends from over the pond in the elevator heading out for a night on the town. They probably feel it is a bargain, even though the hotel is wildly inconsistent, ranging from a \"1\" for the state of the linens, to an \"8\" for the decoration of the lobby, because they getting it at deep discount. 10. Room service. They add on a service charge and a gratuity charge. So a $12.00 plate of tortilla chips and salsa is about $19.00. FYI. I gave the guy $2.00, not realizing they added in the gratuity, so I paid about $21.00 for a pile of chips for the kids. Oops. In summary, I tried to overlook the hotel's shortcomings, and the place oddly grew on me over the three days - sort of like staying at your aged Aunt's house with the ripped sheets and soft beds - because the staff was helpful, the breakfast was excellent and an overpriced brandy can wash down a number of hospitality sins!", "Date": "November 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Playa del Carmen, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Minasld", "ReviewID": "UR10941116", "Content": "We stayed for 4 days and everything was great!

I did a lot of research and Expedia was the cheapest option. After reading all the reviews for 6 months I was wondering if I had done the right thing and kept an open mind as to what the room would be like. Well I have to say that for a single room it was quite large with plenty of room to walk around and the bed was a large double. The bathroom was small but you do not need a large bathroom if only one person is in it. The only problem was the lavatory seat which needed to be held up. The bath had new sealant around it which could have been done better but I guess it was a cheaper option than replacing the whole bath and tiles. The furniture was old but the room was very clean and overall I enjoyed my stay although I only used the room for sleeping.

The water in the shower ran brown for several minutes, but I was told it was due to the fact that the hotel is 100 years old and this problem is standard in the city. During my stay, after throwing a tissue into the toilet, I had to call maintenance to request a plunger due to the toilet clogging and overflowing. I could not manage to close the window, either. There were strange holes in the walls in the bathroom that made me feel uncomfortable, not knowing what could be crawling between the walls and into my room. I had arranged for a package to be delivered for a meeting during my stay and asked the front desk time and again if it had been delivered--they said no. Needless to say, the package had in fact arrived on time (it was 'lost' in the hotel) and I missed the opportunity to share its contents during my business meeting. I did in fact complain to the manager, who offered me a $30 voucher for a very nice buffet breakfast and $100 off my bill. At over $1000 for two nights, with taxes, it was a very small gesture. If you can reserve a room for under $200, I would call it a fair price for what you get.", "Date": "October 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worcestershire, uk", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "simsterc", "ReviewID": "UR10355427", "Content": "The foyer and public areas of the hotel are very grand and impressive.

We got the hotel 2 hours before we could cheek in but one of the very friendly front desk staff booked us in as waiting to go into the room and we could leave our bags with the bellman staff, which meant we could go have an explore round the city and not have to wait in the lobby with our bags. We went back to the hotel around 3ish and checked in and our bags were brought to our room. We had asked for a fridge as well which was brought up within half an hour of it being asked for. If staying in the hotel for more than 4 days I would recommend you request a fridge as it saved us a lot of money on breakfast and lunch. On 5th Avenue just left to the hotel there is a Duane Reade drug store, which sells milk, bread, butter, drinks, cereals etc. and it is a lot cheaper than other stores around the area. The room itself was not the biggest of rooms but it is New York. We had plenty of room to move about in it and the bathroom was a perfect size. Two of us were sharing the room with twin beds and had 3 suitcases that still left us enough room to walk around the room easily. It was nicely decorated and cleaned everyday after we had gone out. All the staff we meet up the hotel were friendly and always said good morning or good afternoon. The lobby is stunning and it was a pleasure to enter into it everyday. Like most people have said the hotel is in a great location easy to walk everyway including Times Square, grand central station, empire state building and Rockefeller centre I would defiantly stay at this hotel again and would highly recommend it. Useful tips: 1. Duane Reade drug store on 5th avenue to the left of the hotel open to 10pm of weekdays and 8pm on Sundays 2. From Grand Central Station 4 or 5 subway take you to Battery Park to get the ferry for the statue of liberty 3.

Comparable rates I was getting in NYC in this location were over $300, most over $400/night. BEST: across the street from Grand Central Terminal, or as I like to call it, the human Habitrail. Get your transit FunPass (they are $7 per person per day) and you can get all over the city very quickly. We visited ALL the major places AND came back late on a friday and it was great. Remember this hotel is old and as such, the rooms are small. It reminded me a lot of the 4 seasons in Seattle which is of the same era but has been remodeled a bit more. We had two beds and when we got our suitcases set up (one on the chair) we didnt have tons of room. But from what I hear most hotels in NY have small rooms. For the age of the hotel the furnishings were current and nice and it had a nice sized bathroom. No coffee maker. Across the street is a place called Cosi. Walk there, they open early and get your coffee and their incredible bagels and bagel breakfast and lunch sandwiches. Also I know there are a couple Starbucks and McDonalds within walking distance of the hotel. you are within and easy walk of timesquare or talk the shuttle in the subway. I was there with only my daughter and except for one time, felt safe walking back and forth. Including at 5am to stand in line for Good Morning America. Now the BAD: Staff is very very busy. Concierge is really busy - go really early or really late. They are very nice but did not know where the famous,and visited by the famous, and unmarked Burger Joint is (I'm not telling!!!). When we went to checkout, the bellman never answered and we drug our very large bags down the elevator ourselves. Tipping. I am from California and I still dont get tipping. NO one helped bring out bags down. They checked them and some guy who brought them to the curb wanted a tip as did the guy who got us transportation (due to the airport we were using, he did a lot of work) - tipped him, not the other guy. Tip - the very nice pretty dark haired girl in the gift shop became our personal concierge. She was NEVER busy and when we went in to get a soda she was SO nice and gave us great ideas, that we kept going back to her. Note - if you are NOT from NYC, we found people to be in general RUDE and obnoxious OR overly super duper nice and helpful. Not that much in between. Of course the rudest were the folks that were in line with us at Good Morning America.

Times Square, et al, are all within easy walking distances. Our room was a Deluxe King corner room on the 15th floor. And although there was no view (other than the rooftop), it was a very good sized, comfortable room. The A/C was cranked down when we opened the door (the way we like it), and we left it pretty cold our entire stay. It functioned quietly and efficiently. As you can see by the photos, there was ample room, and the bed and linen were superb. The bathroom was a little small, and had old style fixtures, and yet was certainly adequate. Good shower with plenty of hot water. We (I) had an small issue with our room safe (totally my fault). Those things and I just don't get along for some reason. It was locked, and we couldn't reopen it. A call to the front desk assured us that a security person would be up soon to help us out. The phone rang about five minutes later and the voice said that the security guard was outside our door. I asked them why didn't he knock, and they replied that the DND sign was on the door. I thought that was very respectful, since I had called them requesting a service, yet they still honored the sign. He fixed it in about sixty seconds and was on his way. Great guest service in this instance. Our only criticism would be the fact that the day we were leaving there was a large parade scheduled to go up 5th Ave, in the AM, which would mean that 5th Ave. would be closed from 44th through 86th streets !!!!!!! We learned that information the day before from a bartender (not at the hotel). My brother had his car in the hotel garage and no one, (front desk nor parking valet) mentioned to him that he would have difficulty getting his car out the next day, and a big headache getting across 5th Ave. since it would be closed. Just a few words or a 'heads up' from someone on the staff, letting us know that this was taking place, and would affect us, would have been something that I would have expected from a competent, dedicated, helpful staff. We glanced in and sat briefly in the bar area, which was very nice, but neither drank there or used the restaurant. Overall, our stay (1 night) was very pleasant. We enjoyed the room's spaciousness, cleanliness, coolness and the extremely comfortable bed, as we lounged Sunday morning with the Times and TV.

The location is good and that is the only positive statement we can make. We arrived after a long-delayed flight at 5 a.m. to be told by reception that they did not have our booking. We eventually managed to sort this out but the attitude of the receptionist was not particularly helpful or friendly. We were allocated a room on 18th floor only to find that the shower could not be regulated \u2013 either scalding hot or freezing cold. We reported this early next morning, as well as requesting a replacement iron (our iron had something scorched on the plate). We returned at 6 p.m looking forward to a shower only to find that nothing had happened and everyone disclaimed any knowledge of our phone call that morning. By 6.30 p.m. (after 2 calls to chase them up) someone came to look at the shower. He reported that nothing could be done quickly to fix the fault and suggested that we were moved to another room. We were therefore offered a room on the 16th floor and began to pack our suitcases. We did receive assistance in moving our suitcases. Unfortunately, the same problem was experienced in the new room. We were subsequently told that any room above the 6th floor experiences these problems. The next morning our toilet overflowed onto the bathroom floor and we put towels down to mop up the water. Someone came out within 10 minutes and unblocked the toilet and we requested that somebody came to clean up the room immediately. This request fell on deaf ears and nothing happened until the next morning when it was dealt with by the normal cleaning staff. The air conditioning was very noisy and had to be switched off at night, which made the room very stuffy. There is a general air of mustiness in the corridors and a feeling that everywhere could do with a good clean. Avoid room service and the hotel restaurant as these are ridiculously over-priced and unbelievably slow. The restaurant (and reception area) are constantly 'blessed' with the music of a dis-embodied, tuneless piano player which does nothing for a visitor's digestive system. The constant expectation to tip, tip, tip really got us down, particularly as the service, at best, was mediocre. More customer-care training of their staff would be a good investment.

It has a very grand lobby and bar but it is a shame that that is where the charm ends. The elevators are very slow and if you are on one of the higher floors can take a long time, seemingly stopping at every floor on the way. Firstly, the room was for three of us. It had two queen sized beds (bit of a squeeze for two adults) but we found it to be quite roomy and certainly larger than some hotels we have stayed in London. The furnishings were old (not antique as previous reviews) but just well used, marked, stained, lampshades burnt in places. Swivel chair very nice but seat pad badly stained. However the worst thing was that generally it wasn't very clean. The bed linen was OK (however beds never made properly - sheets just laid across beds so I had to tuck them in myself otherwise would have just come off) the towels were clean - but used plastic cutlery from a previous occupant found on floor . I moved the bed against the wall and underneath was full of dust (dust still left there on subsequent days even though room 'cleaned'). Room was very hot and stuffy, air conditioning not the best and VERY noisy. The hotel generally looks very dark and grimy. Some have said it is old fashioned and has character - I would say that it could do with a good thorough clean and lick of paint! However the worst was yet to come! One morning I went to get my sons toothbrush for him only to find a large cockroach sitting on it! I called housekeeping who removed it and assured me that the bathroom would be sanitised that morning as a result. We returned to our room at 5pm to find that the room had not been cleaned or made up at all and they were unsure when it would be able to be done. I was not happy knowing that cockroaches had been wandering around in the bathroom so asked to be moved to another room. The staff were, to their credit, very helpful. The next room was alot cleaner and the fixtures alot newer. The next day, my husband found another cockroach in his jeans which he had taken out of the closet and there was another one on the sheets on the side of the bed. I can put up with alot of things in hotels and realize that they cannot all be perfect, but cleanliness is very important and if you do not have that then it is a bad hotel - especially when you are staying with young children.

The bathroom had a hairdryer and bath and body works products. The location was very convenient! The concierge pointed out Grand Central Terminal for us and the subway made things very accessible. We did not think that we would take the subway, but it saved us a ton of money in cab rides. We took the subway to Century 21, SOHO and to Central Park (72nd Street) and we didn't have any problems. The hotel is very close to all of the shops on fifth avenue, bloomingdales, macy's and times square. We had an awesome time and couldn't have asked for more, particularly since the hotel offers a great price. I would avoid the lounge/restaurant, it seemed expensive. We ate at a Mexican restaurant across from Grand Central Terminal, called 'Tequillaville'. It had great mexican and some great beer! My only warning would be that the kitchens and deli's seemed to close early (kitchens around 9pm), so you may have to venture a bit farther for food sometimes.

I had 2 kids so I asked \"is non-smoking room a guarrantee?\"and she said \"YES\". So I booked. Got there about 9pm (hey I'm experienced booking in this country, so I know I might not have that room). Procceded to the room and it's a smoking room. Ask for an exchange and they said \"Sorry we don't have 2-bed room. But we have a king-size non-smoking with a sofa-bed.\" I said I was told this is a guarrantee room and he said \"I don't know who you told to, but I don't have the room right now. (You know this is typical American way of doing business) I repeated what I said before and he said he's going to call me back. Few mins later, he magically made a non-smoking room for me. What a surprise! That room is non-smoking okay but he put us on a floor where there's a huge group of youngers just finished performing in the boardway or something, and the room is super small. That night was horrible because the kids were drunk and talked loud in the lobby just like a party, noisy 'til 2am when a security guy said \"open the door or I'm calling the police\" The room was super small. We ordered room service (because of the kids). 20% additional charge plus $4.00 delivery. Missed a desert which is $10. Asked for a credit and only $10 is back. Not the 20%. I don't really care for that $2.00 but it really shows how dishonest these people are.

I agree with the other travelers that the hotel staff was not very friendly. I wouldn't say they were flat-out rude, but no smiles or welcoming attitude. However, service levels in America are rapidly declining across the board in general. The hotel was very busy at all times of the day and night. Elevators were slow and crowded at times. Our non-smoking room on the 8th floor was small, with one queen sized bed. Just enough room for two people. We didn't go to NYC to hang out in the hotel, so it was ok for us. The bed was extremely comfortable, nice pillows. The room and bathroom were very clean, the water was hot, water pressure good. Bath & Body Works brand products, although you better like Coconut Lime Verbana flavor. The one thing that annoyed me the most was the housekeeping staff. On Easter Sunday morning around 8am, they were walking up and down the corridor banging on doors, slamming doors and loudly shouting \"housekeeping!\" before coming in to a room. Also vacuuming in hallway very early. I have never stayed in a hotel where the housekeepers come that early, esp. on Sunday. Unless you are a VERY early riser, I strongly recommend using the \"do not disturb\" sign although you will still hear them as they make their way up and down the hall. We elected to not have the room cleaned during our stay. The walls were thin and we could hear our neighbors talking, sneezing, etc. I'm sure they could hear us as well. Also, lots of morning street noise, horns, sirens, etc. The heat worked almost too well, there was no medium - all or nothing. The fan, although noisy, did a good job of drowning out the sound of housekeeping in the mornings. We didn't try the restaurant or room service as there are so many terrific restaurants and coffee shops within a 2 minute walk. NYC is an amazing city. Overall, the hotel was fine for the amount we paid thru Priceline. Looking on other travel websites, a low quality chain hotel was priced at $200+ which is ridiculous to me.

On entering the room, yes it's small as other reviewers commented on but plenty of space for two. There was a patch of damaged carpet that could easily have been mended, wouldn't have looked too bad if the frayed threads had been removed. The bath seal was mouldy in several areas (how long does it take to put a new seal around the bath), bath enamel damaged and a few tiles on the bathroom floor, towels although replaced daily were passed there best. The room was clean but first impressions count & this was disappointing for us. There was no vanity bar in the bathroom just one small shelf for toiletries. We had noise from the next room whenever they ran water or flushed the toilet; also we could hear the people in the next room and constant noise from the corridor & the banging of doors. After the first night we straightened the bedding as we do not like to leave an untidy room & after housekeeping we found the bed had not been made although the room had been cleaned, so after that left the bed a little untidy to make sure the bed was made up. We were also surprised there were no bath robes provided and only a few coat hangers. Our room overlooked a roof area with no view & a little hum from the machinery, but not a problem we were not in the room long enough to admire the views. Never had a problem with the lifts as other reviewers commented on even though the hotel was very busy all the time. The hotel staff were pleasant and the concierge was very helpful & managed to obtain tickets to a Snow Patrol concert at Madison Square Garden on the day even though they were sold out on-line.

As we were on the 18th floor (top) this was a potential health and safety issue. I reported this immediately (by going down to the lobby 18 floors) and nobody came. I thought it would be done the next day but nothing so I reported it again. Nothing done so I reported it a third time and still nobody came. The staff on reception were very solomn, abrupt and did not appear interested. I finally handed my feedback card to the manager as we were checking out and he was equally useless! The final insult was when we checked out, the receptionist commented (in a surprised voice) that we had no room charges - I again pointed out that this may have had something to do with the fact that we had no phone so could not have ordered any room service or made calls!

It was so late and we were too tired to try to sort things out - so we managed to get a cot for the night from a very helpful floor manager. The next morning our accommodation was sorted out with the help of the friendly desk staff. Our New York adventure had begun! We found the room spacious, clean, with very comfortable double beds. The ensuite was small but how long does one want to spend in a bathroom!!! The three of us found it large enough to come and go with ease! We even had a walk in closet. Upon our return every evening the beds were made, the pillows plumped and the room a perfect temperature. We read the reviews of others prior to our trip and were a litle apprehensive - but we did not encounter any difficulties - the elevators worked wonderfully - perhaps with some congestion near check out time - but that is too be expected - it is a huge facility!! We had after dinner drinks in the comfortably appointed bar - relaxed in the soft chairs in the lobby and enjoyed the ambience of the grand dame of New York!! It was close to Times Square, to Grand Central Station, the doormen were always ready to lend a helping hand and the concierge had a wealth of New York information.

He did agree in the end that there was a problem (and apparently in most rooms on the 18th) with the water tempreture. to this end he got us moved to a double room on the 10th floor with no extra charge, the hotel also gave us a free breakfast for the upheavall of moving.

I was extremely impressed with the beauty of this hotel. The rooms were quite large (we reserved Superior rooms) and the lobby, bar, and floor lobbies were so nice. Bathrooms were a little dated and could use a refresh and the ac/heat unit continually sounded like it had pigeons flying around in them. :) HOWEVER, the entire group continually commented on how incredibly comfortable the beds were. They really were so comfy. If you are looking for a nice hotel with SUPER beds, this is it. The only hotel that beats this one for bed comfort is the Ritz and it is $500 per night! The location is super as well, there is an entrance to Grand Central Station directly across the street. Tony, the Doorman, is an incredible asset to this hotel and does all he can to ensure you have a cab immediately. One of the guests in our party ended up having to see the hotel doctor and briefly had to go to the hospital. They recieved no less than three followup calls from the hotel staff to see how they were doing. Very impressive. The only thing about this hotel that I would recommend you prepare for is the sometimes on/sometimes off service staff in the rooms/front desk and restaurant. On Thursday night the folks across the hall from us had room service and their dirty dishes stayed in the hallway until Friday night when we actually removed the tray ourselves as it was stinking up the hall. The maids also left our dirty glasses in the room all weekend. I don't see how they clean the rooms and just walk past all this stuff. The staff of the restaurant (servers) appeared to be aggravated when we would request water for our table or refills. Also, the hotel charges a \"Gratuity Service Fee\" that was explained later as a fee to literally sit in the restaurant. It was explained to me as I was having it removed from my bill by the manager. The front desk staff were nice when we arrived, but when we were checking out we were treated horribly by a man at the desk. We requested to be assisted by the manager since this man was obviously not interested in addressing our needs. The doormen, cooks, concierge, barstaff, and bellhops at this hotel were TERRIFIC. I totally recommend this hotel if you can get a special rate as we did (average $155 per night). I do not recommend paying the rack rates for this hotel as things like the poor service cut deeper when you pay over $250 for a hotel. If this hotel can work on its service personnel and revamp the bathrooms it would definitely qualify as a 4 star.", "Date": "January 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Loughborough, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cComfortable hotel - great location\u201d", "Author": "christineb", "ReviewID": "UR6718906", "Content": "My husband and I have just returned from a 4 night stay in the Roosevelt Hotel. We carried our own bags into the lobby and were not hassled by the bellboys. There were 3 receptionists at check-in and we were seen immediately. There was a mix-up with our booking but straight away the receptionist assured us there would not be a problem. Although it took her about 5 minutes to sort everything out, she kept us informed the whole time and even admitted it was the hotel\u2019s fault. This impressed us as all too often people will often try to blame others. We were given the choice of 1 or 2 beds. We took the lifts to the 12th floor and did not have to wait at all. In fact during the whole of our stay we found the lifts to be quick - I don't know why other people have found it such a problem. Considering the hotel has over 1,000 rooms I was amazed we didn\u2019t have to wait longer than a minute or so at any time. Our room was approximately 16ft x 13ft with a 6ft wide bed in the middle. The mattress (Serta) was indeed every bit as comfortable as previous reviewers have stated. Personally I think a clean room and a comfortable bed is more important than a huge room. Other people have mentioned peeling wallpaper but although our room was a little \"tired\" it was certainly not scruffy. It was extremely cold outside whilst we were there, minus12 degrees centigrade on one of the days, but the room was always very warm. The bathroom was small but not uncomfortably so. There were plenty of towels and toiletries and masses of hot water with a powerful shower. OK, so the bath isn\u2019t huge, but it was nice to soak in after a day\u2019s hard walking. (Would have been even better if the plug had fitted and the water didn\u2019t constantly drain away.) The room was at the back of the hotel and the view was just other hotel rooms, but the window was double-glazed and noise was minimal. The hotel does not provide drinks making facilities but does provide an iron/board and electronic safe which is extremely useful. Our safe mal-functioned one evening and a member of staff appeared within 20 minutes of our telephone call to sort it out. The hotel has internet facilites for a small charge, which we took advantage of to check-in for our return flight. It is also possible to leave your luggage on your last day \u2013 don\u2019t forget to tip the bellboy!! We did not eat at the hotel as it was expensive but there are plenty of pubs nearby or Grand Central Station (fantastic building) has plenty of eating options. As nearly every reviewer has stated the location is perfect (unless you want to be on top of Times Square). It doesn\u2019t take long to walk a few blocks and there are plenty of diners etc \u2013 although we ate every morning at the Red Flame Diner on 44th Street \u2013 address 67W 44th between 5th & 6th Avenue and can highly recommend it for good food and fast service. We thoroughly enjoyed the whole of stay in New York and found everyone we came into contact with, very polite and friendly.

Then we had to carry our luggage back up to the 2nd floor to check it for the day. The restaurant is so-so. For dinner, the presentation of the food was much better than the actual taste.

The room was large by New York standards, and we had no problem putting the hotel's cot in a corner of the room. I had stayed at the Roosevelt a few years previously, and I know not all the rooms are as large. Since I was attending a conference there, I arranged two days of babysitting via the hotel with the Babysitter's Guild. It wasn't cheap at $25 per hour, but I had no qualms leaving the baby in the nanny's care. Toiletries were adequate, the shower powerful, so no complaints there. Indeed, no complaints at all, and a pleasant surprise was the quality of the room service dinner I had one night. I ordered the classic club sandwich with the soup of the day, which turned out to be a homemade corn chowder rivalling my grandfather's recipe.

On arrival to our room on the sixteenth floor we were pleasantly surprised, having only paid \u00a3600 ($1050) for the room through Octopus Travel, we weren't expecting lavish, but I think we got more than our moneys worth. Huge and sooo comfortable bed, plenty of room, heater that worked very well, and a clean bathroom. Throughout our stay the room and bathroom were cleaned and tidied brillantly, bed beautifully made and clean towels daily. We were unlucky enough to be in New York during the transit strike, but the hotel kept us well informed and the staff were able to make it to work, did a fantastic job and must have worked from dawn til dusk as the hotel and our room remained spotless. We only ate dinner and breakfast in the hotel once but the food was great. The breakfast buffet had a huge selection and should be more than enough for anybody! The hotel bar also has a lovely atmosphere and is great to chill out in after a heavy days shopping! I think all the photos of the lobby speak for themselves, it really is beautiful, and seeing it at Christmas only accentuated that. Every evening of our stay there was a complimentary warming drink (egg nog, warm apple cider) and biscuits available in the lobby for guests to take to their rooms. I really couldn't fault the hotel on their service; they really look after their guests. Other reviews state that it is noisy and you can hear traffic, but it is New York what do you expect!!?

Having looked at the Roosevelt on both the BA website and on the Expedia website, I thought it would do nicely as it was centrally located for our shopping needs. The first bad start was they didn't have my friend booked in as she had booked separately and was added on at a later date with British Airways but staying in the same room as myself and my daughter. We were told by British Airways that the rooms had two large double beds and could easily sleep 4 people and still have lots of space, so to cut down on cost - and more money for shopping - we kept the same room originally booked for 2. Eventually, the kind lady on reception booked us all in without any fuss especially as I had my receipt from BA adding an extra person to the booking. We were then taken to our room and what a disappointment. It was very small although it had 2 double beds and an armoire with the TV in, plus a desk in the corner and a table between the beds. Too cramped for 3 people. 2 would have managed but barely. There was no hanging space for clothes so we had to keep our clothes in our suitcases the entire trip. Luckily we didn't need to iron anything. The cupboard where the ironing board and safe was kept smelled damp and musty so we only opened it once and never again! The room was clean enough but the beds had no top covers (which were on order!) The bathroom was only big enough to swing a cat and there was no bath, only a shower cubicle which leaked everytime we took a shower and made the floor completely wet. We wore flip flops in the shower as it didn't look very clean to stand on. There was mould on the ceiling and around the tiled area. If you were a tall person, your legs would touch the door when you sat on the toilet!! Luckily we were not. The staff were very pleasant and friendly, especially Tony who does his best to get you a taxi if you need one. I have no complaints about them whatsoever. We didn't eat at the hotel as we were out mos of the time. We had a drink at the bar on our last day which seemed pricey and ordered room service of hot water to make some herbal teas (total cost of over $5!!) The Roosevelt should either upgrade their rooms or downgrade their star rating.

It was my daughter's first trip and she loved it and of course the shopping.

The company had selected the Roosevelt as the \"official hotel\". Was someone getting paid off at my employer by the hotel?

However, other words of a less kind nature describe what come to mind when you talk to the less-the-friendly staff at the bell station. The bell captain (bald, heavier set man) is so professional (?) that he comes off stand-offish and cold. My favorite staff experience was when I had to get my bags out of storage (I had to check out but wasn't leaving NYC until that afternoon). I had lost my house keys and has OBVIOUSLY freaking out. I gave my claim ticket to a bellman and I followed him to the storage room. He returned in a manner of say, 5 steps. As I frantically searched the bags I felt a overwhelming sense that the bellman was WAITING for a tip. Over the whole situation, I gave him $2 (too much as far as I am concerned) to which he left me....not even an offer to take my bags down the very long entry staircase to the street to get a cab, or even get my cab for that manner. Thanks, Bellman. 2. The room - Um, a dorm room might have been sexier. The kind size bed had been shoved into a room that was never designed for one. The armoire holding the TV had to be moved and put diagonally off to the side from it original position; otherwise, one would have to crawl over the bed to go from one side of the room to the other. AND, if it couldn't get better, the marking on the carpet to where the armoire once stood was still there. Um, hi housekeeping, could someone run a sweeper over this? And just to add insult to injury, the wallpaper there had begun to peel.

How does it work at Roosevelt when you reserve a room through priceline \u201cname your own price\u201d: What they do to name your own price customers is that they give a very small, dark, shabby, and far from being renovated rooms, usually in a low floor, very noisy etc. These rooms are sold usually as a single room and they have twin size bed. The window will usually face a wall or low floor where you enjoy all the noise coming from the street. Since I arrived with small child I have called the hotel after my offer with priceline was accepted, to make sure that this is a reasonable size room. They say that the room is suitable for 2 (hardly for 2 very small people, after I saw it). But Roosevelt has an attractive offer for Name your own price users. If I want a bigger room (which is actually a standard double room sold on the hotel\u2019s web site, expedia and even priceline\u2019s web site when you pay full price of around $180-190 per night) you can pay extra $60 per night over what pricleine charges your credit card, which brings the total price per night to $185, much above what I would have paid for such an hotel. So I had 2 options \u2013 stay with the $125 per night I received from priceline for a twin bed small, dark & ugly room, or pay the $185 for standard room which is not really a good value for money (it cost about the same price on any web site without discounts or favors). Now what would you do??? Luckily enough as we were traveling with our 2 years old child, when I arrived to the Roosevelt at night with her screaming in my arms, the nice shift manager (a lady of course) felt so sorry for us that she upgraded us at no extra cost to a regular size room which was OK & good value for the $125 we have paid. I was lucky, but don\u2019t count on it. Bottom line: 1.Good location. 2.Take it only if you don\u2019t care about room size or look and only want to pay $120 for a hardly 3 stars hotel in mid Manhattan. 3.If you can spare extra $50 per night I would try the \u2018name your own price\u201d only for 4 star hotel and up. 4.Apparently 3 stars hotels in Manhattan are very likely to look like 1.5-2 stars anywhere else. 5.Don\u2019t count on luck, most people fail where I was lucky\u2026 Good luck", "Date": "September 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alexandria, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cNot impressed\u201d", "Author": "unique72", "ReviewID": "UR5624027", "Content": "Maybe we got the priceline room.

The lobby was amazing, unfortunately to dark for pictures. We tried the resturant, excelent service, but a bit pricy, two persons, 200 dollars for entrees, desert and a bottle of wine. The food was excelent, except for the desert (why wasn't I warned about root beer and vanilla ice), which was our own fault. The bar was great, with a large selection of single malt whiskey, drinks, beers. The prices were a bit higher than avarage. The location of the hotel is excelent, in walking distance to Grand Central Station, Empire State Building, Central Park and the UN building. It is close to the Metlife building, which we used as a guidence, to find our way to the hotel. When we checked out, the bell boy took care of our luggage (for free, except tips) and when we departed for the airport, we used the hotel car for JFK.

Considering the hotel was built in 1924 I thought the toilet and bathtub were going to very old but that was not the case. They have been updated and look very modern. The air conditioning worked and was not as loud as some people have complained about. We also checked out the fitness centre just to see what it would be like and it turned out to be quite nice. You can help yourself to the fruits in the fruit basket and a water dispenser is also available. We had no problems with the elevators. We arrived at 7pm and checked in with no problems. Checking out was also as easy with no hidden charges and surprises. The only complaint we have is that the whole place was very dark even on the brightest day when the sun was shining. But I guess that's the way it was back in the 1920's and they wanted to keep the feel from that era. I would recommend the Roosevelt to anyone.

We had seen it in our room before we left in the morning, but when we returned just after lunch, the room was made up and the bear gone. I immediately called housekeeping and also asked the maid who serviced my room, but they were barely helpful as they told me to simply wait. Because of the sentimental value of the bear, plus a flight the very next day, I even volunteered to find it myself (through it might have been sent to the laundry with the linen) but they would not let me citing liability issues. All throughout the afternoon and night, the staff was outright rude and unhelpful, and almost seemed to be laughing at the situation - most likely since it was not anything expensive and simply a bear - a bear, however, that meant nearly everything to my dying nephew. For the maid to accidentally send a teddy bear with the linen to the laundry seemed ridiculous and irresponsible, but the staff also didn't even think to check her even though she was the only one to enter the room. Overall, they did very little to help my situation and instead was very rude in their responses and could also see them laughing about the situation. Overall, I was disgusted in the poor and rude customer service, especially the manager whom seemed to not want to help at all. In all, it seemed they were more concerned about protecting their laundry and their employees rather than helping me - makes you wonder how a hotel could survive still with so little focus on the customer.

You can always use the stairs, but the hotel has a lot of floors. I pity you if you are staying on one of the upper floors and there are elevator issues.

Single rooms tend to be real small so if visitors dont like tiny rooms they should opt to book a double room. Many people on this board write that rooms are \"cheap\" at the Roosevelt. I dont know how $305 plus taxes every night for a regular standard room, the cheapest availble, is considered cheap - but there are many hotels on Manhattan that can beat this for the same quality and probably far better service too. Services are a bit of a mess in this hotel. I ordered roomservice several time and must admit I felt annoyed when I discovered that I had been paying almost tripple on the tip all the time. This hotel includes tip in the bill because all the European tourists are not used to paying tip and neglect paying the required 15% tip (people you are in the USA: you MUST pay tip! If you dont pay tip they have to pay income on the amounts anyways. How do you calculate tip? Just double the tax charge and that's what your tip is). Well, roomservice never told me tip was included in the total when I handed them cash tip each time I ordered something. And one Indian man from roomservice was a total mess; always forgetting something belonging to the order and then he arguing with me when I asking for it! Incredible person. How did he get the job? Finally I asked them not to send this man to my room whenever I had roomservice because it was such a hassel. How am I to wait 15 minutes for utensils when the food by that time is already cold, or have my bread and butter delivered AFTER I am finished, or my coffee brought cold at heavy room charges? He just didnt seem to get it. The other roomservice guys were OK. Roomcleaning was allright, but occasionally they would not vaccum or change anything but towels which meant shampoo, toilette paper and clean drinking glasses were not replaced. This should not be misunderstood; the rooms are still clean at the Roosevelt. Only the quality of the staff is lacking at this hotel and there seem to be no management that monitors staff properly. I was also charged wrong on my bill and to this day have not been credited. I stod in line three times in front of 20 tourists who had no more serious questions than asking where Times Square is to resolve the issue with my excess charges, but finally gave up. After all, I was on a business trip and on time restraint. I dont know if I would recommed this hotel for business travelers. If you have time to search for other hotels I would recommend a traveler to do so, otherwise Roosevelt is an OK medium class hotel to stay at. I feel this hotel should keep the rates at $150-200 a night max, then everything from room quality to messy staff makes sense.", "Date": "May 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derbyshire", "Title": "\u201cGood location... but...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5042730", "Content": "The hotel is in a great location, within walking distance of shops and places to see, but the hotel itself is quite old-fashioned and dingy.

You can't compare the Roosevelt to places like the Waldorf Towers and Ritz-Carlton because it is much less expensive, and similarly you shouldn\u2019t go there expecting similar service and rooms, although I might warn that we had a suite at the Roosevelt which wasn't bad, but it wasn't perfect - so the 'standard' rooms might be less satisfactory; I'd definitely ask for a room which has been refurbished recently, has a bit of a view etc. to avoid their perhaps slightly crumbling standard rooms. The suite decoration was a bit bland, but comfortable and unpretentious. Everything was perfectly clean and the room was cleaned very well each day. Several things went wrong (like things breaking) but the problems were quickly rectified, and compensation in the form of free drinks in the bar or free breakfast was offered (which we gladly accepted!) We had 2 televisions (with a good selection of channels and some games), a hair-dryer, iron and ironing board, empty refrigerator, 3 2-line telephones, safe deposit box, coffee maker and coffee powder and 2 closets, although if you\u2019re getting a different type of room and are bothered about the exact amenities, I would check before booking exactly what is included. There were 2 bathrooms which had lovely large (well by European standards) old semi-sunken tubs, one had a separate shower and the other a shower above the tub, and both had ample towels, face-cloths/flannels and toiletries. The hotel was well maintained, the general decor pleasant and grand in the lobby, and the location hard to beat. The staff were friendly and helpful. The only real problem encountered was the wait for the elevators. The hotel is only served by 6 elevators, and we found ourselves waiting a long time for an elevator which wasn't full during peak times, like trying to get down for breakfast. The breakfast buffet was pretty good, with a large selection of things, both American and Continental and -yes, Krispy Kreme doughnuts! The service at breakfast was good, the plates clean and the atmosphere relaxed. Finally, perhaps it is worth noting that the cooling units were quite noisy and old, so this may be a problem to guests staying in summer especially at night.

With Priceline, we were scheduled to get the smallest room they had, but the hotel upgraded us to a larger room for free. I think that's because we got there before check-in and they had extra rooms. 3. The room was nice and clean. The bed was comfy. BAD - 1. Starbucks adds in the room were misleading. It sounded like they \"served\" free coffee. That was not the case. In fact, there was no free coffee anywhere in the hotel and no coffee maker in the room. They sold Starbucks at the bar. 2. We couldn't get hot water a few nights when we were getting ready to go out, between 6-7 pm. Just cold water for a long time. 3. They have those $5 bottles of Evian in the room. We bought our own bottled water and it mysteriously disappeared. 4. Also, they charged $25 for a sub-standard breakfast buffet. It was the same eggs and bacon that you would get at McDonalds. 5. When we left for the airport, the head bellhop told us that we could take a hotel car to La Guardia for a \"flat-rate\" of $35.

We did not have breakfast in the hotel, so I cannot commend on that. We did however have dinner, which I found tasty and reasonably priced ($230 for a 3-course meal and a bottle of wine for four persons). Service was great in every occassion (front desk, concierge, waiters, maids, bellboy and doorman), except for one particular lady at the front desk. Location is great: it is very close to Grand Central station, while you can walk to almost every major attraction. We had to use a cab only once, when we attended a Metropolitan Opera performance at the Lincoln Center. Tip: when you first enter the hotel, you will have to get on a flight of stairs to get to the lobby. It may be difficult to do if you carry a lot of luggage.

The room was decent and clean enough with a smallish window looking out onto a side street - nothing to write home about. The staff was very friendly and helpful.

It was just annoying at first, but it got worse as they had a young child that awoke at 7 a.m. every day, and therefore we were also awake at 7 a.m. every day. Every time their door closed, it rattled our entire wall and made our door shake very loudly. Needless to say, we got very little sleep after they arrived. I would recommend this hotel due to its great location and affordability, but I would encourage anyone staying here to do yourself a favor and get earplugs!", "Date": "January 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cA mixed bag\u201d", "Author": "S_S9901", "ReviewID": "UR4392922", "Content": "Our $159/night room at the Roosevelt was dark and small, with a small interior window and a very noisy heater.

The buffet breakfast was excellent, with omlettes to order, a large selection of fresh fruit, and attentive service. 2. The doormen and bell staff were very helpful and courteous. 3. The house cleaners made an extra effort, putting our cut flowers in a vase without us asking. Other things were disappointing: 1. An alarm went off in an ajoining room. It took 3 phone calls to the front desk and security and 1 1/2 hours to get this addressed. It turned out to be a smoke alarm. 2. Then, when we left for dinner, we found the hallway filled with furniture, and no hotel employee in sight. We had to pick our way through the furniture. Anyone less agile or with disability would not have been able to get through. It appeared unsafe. 3. The housekeepers re-arranged our personal belongings in our room, making it difficult to find things (good intention, bad result). 4. The heater was noisy and we could not get the room to a comfortable temperature during our three-day stay. 5. After checking out, I realized I had left an item in my room. The people I spoke with on the phone expressed very little interest in helping me recover it, and never followed up as promised. 6.

We informed her that we were there, she was not, and well aware that we had to walk to his car. Next, upon check in, my boyfriend asked about the champagne and strawberries he had arranged to be in our room. The lady that checked us in did not offer to verify they would be there, and stated there were 7 other guests with the same name that weekend. Upon arrival in our room, they were not there. We wished to see some museums in the area but were concerned about them being open with the holiday weekend. We asked the concierge, and were told they would all be closed on Sunday and Monday. We asked the next day again, and were told they would all be open. We ate breakfast in the restaurant one morning. $25 per person for a breakfast buffet.

The hotel has an excellent location, minutes walking distance from Times Square, 5th Avenue, Grand Central Station etc. It was the perfect base for our holiday. The room was adequate, very large king size bed, clean crisp white linen with a desk, chair and separate bathroom (bath and shower). The wardrobe was incredibly small and also housed the ironing board, so if your only staying for a short trip you can hang up coats etc which is acceptable, but for a longer stay it would have been a bit annoying living out of your suitcase all the time. The bathroom was a fair size with good shower and plenty of towels. We had heard all hotel rooms in NYC were small and this was no exception, but for all the time you actually spend in your room, it was more than adequate. We were on the 8th floor and overlooked the road and you could hear traffic noise, but it is New York after all! Hotel itself is very nice and clean, but we never really spent much time there and it was purely a place to sleep!. Lobby is grand and inviting \u2013 however there was no bell boy to help us up the stairs with our bags. I think they were just busy as every other day there was 2/3 waiting to greet guests. I\u2019m sure if we stood at the front door someone would have come to our attention, but our bags were fairly small so it was not a major problem. We ate breakfast there a couple of mornings and the choice of food was very good. However, there are plenty of deli\u2019s nearby where you can sit with a coffee and bagel and watch the world go by. If I have any complaints, they are only minor and personal.. 1) The front desk staff are not the most polite, maybe we caught them on a bad day, but after a long trip you expect to be greeted by someone a bit more pleasant. The ladies manner was quite abrupt and not the usual American charm I\u2019ve had when visiting other States. Saying that, she checked us in in under 5 mins 2) The hotel is full of brass and everywhere I touched I got an electric shock \u2013 beware of the lift buttons and stair rails!

Well, our expectations were met and exceeded. First of all, the location is exceptional. Located at 45th and Madison, the hotel is prime for east side shopping (Fifth Avenue is one block away). Grand Central Terminal is only two streets south. If you have Broadway shows, you are 4 blocks away (a 15 minute walk). Secondly, the staff was friendly and helpful...from the front desk staff to the bellman. Lastly, my room was clean and well appointed. We checked in early and only a room with a double bed was available at that time. We were worn out from flying so we chose the double bed instead of waiting for a king bed. Our room was standard in size with a writing desk, chair, and a armoire with tv. The bathroom was standard size with a shower only (not sure if rooms with other bedding configurations have a tub or not).

I was greeted by a HUGE stain on the carpet in the entrance and walked in further only to discover a truly mediocre room that had obviously been poorly maintained!!! There were stains all over the carpet and holes in the wall down by the base moldings that could be easily repaired if attention were paid to them. The bathroom was small but had good lighting and the shower had great water pressure, the only good thing about the room!! The supposedly king sized bed seemed small and was very \"short\" I am only 5'6 and my feet were touching the bottom of the bed. Not only that but it was like sleeping on bricks, not very comfortable at all. The t.v was in this cabinent that was placed on an odd angle in a corner of the room which made it almost impossible to watch t.v. Aside from the room being awful, I found that the staff were not only rude but had no idea about anything. I asked the concierge about how much a shuttle would be to the airport and was told he didn't know of any shuttles but offered to call a car service which would have cost me $150. Also the hotel is in the middle of a business district so there are almost no places to deliver food to the hotel, but there is a mcdonalds, wendys and sbarro 2 blocks away if you feel like walking and the hotel is only 2 blocks from grand central station which does make it very easy to get on the subway so you can go grab a bite to eat in the village or somewhere else!! Overall I do not recommend this hotel for anyone who is looking for good service, convenience and amenities. If you want expensive and not worth the $$ go stay at the Roosevelt!!!

For example, the water in the bathroom was coffee-coloured (literally) on two occasions and the rooms were small, dark and poorly furnished. The thing that has changed this to a \"terrible\" rating was their extraordinary response to yet a further problem. On the fourth day our toilet came loose from the floor (seriously!). When I reported this in the morning they: Did nothing until that evening when I reminded them Came in at 6pm, removed the toilet, then said it would take three hours to put it back, so we would have to move to another room. Gave us a room too small for a rollaway bed for my son, so he had nowhere to sleep. Told us that if we left our luggage in the orginal room (which we would be going back to the next day), they would charge us for two rooms. When I complained about this, called security. I was actually quite frightened by the whole experience. We moved into the Hilton for the last two days, which was not much more money and absolutely lovely.

The lobby and entrance was fancy and the hotel had a nice, classical atmosphere. We wanted to have a nice family holliday and tried to ignore certain things but now afterall, it is worth mentioning for others. 1.The room-booking: We had long in advance asked for two twins close to eachother; we were put in totally separated floors. We asked to be moved and that couldn't be done until next day. We agreed to do this because we were garanteed that the rooms would be next to eachother. We packed everything and checked out the next morning and were convinced that the problem would be solved when we arrived on the afternoon from the city tour. Result: the new rooms were on same floor but not even same corridor. As a result, our new rooms were also smaller and gathered round the NOISY air conditioner-system in the yard. (Not a nice view, I can tell you\u2026just pipes and metal cubes). We gave feedback and were offered to change again, but not until next day...it sounded rather ridiculous given that we could not be sure the the same wouldn't happen again so we stayed in our rooms. After all, we reasoned, the hotel is only for sleeping (if you managed from the noise..). It is worth mentioning that the rooms were rather dark and the bathrooms small. 3. The lobby service (tourist info): It seemed like one of the older gentlemen had little clue of what he was advising to guests. On our last day (Columbus day), we had planned to do some last shopping. We asked about the opening hours of a department store near to ground cero as we were not familiar with this holliday. He said that the stores would not open until 11 o'clock due to sunday-schedule. We thought it was a pitty and decided to take it easy with a coffee in the loppy and so on. However, when we left the hotel for a last walk and to look for the parade at 10.00am, we noticed that the stores were open! It was too late to take us to the south due to traffic and we were very disspointed as we realised that the department store had been open since 7:45am according to normal schedule. Not nice for your last day. We also asked simultaneously about the best way to get a taxi for four to the JFK. He said that no normal taxi would take us, so he offered to book a bigger taxi, though it would cost up to 110$! It sounded incredible (we had payed 47$ JFK-Manhattan) and decided to look for another option. Well, it appeared that the black Lincolns outside the entrance only charged 50$ and had no problem with taking us all. The worst thing was that this gentleman had a rather arrogant attitude and probably just didn\u2019t want to admit that he didn\u2019t know so we could have asked elsewere. (luckily we chose to ask the portiere about the taxi...) So, as a summary: small things determine the quality of a hotel and service can well compensate faults in the facilities....In this, Roosevelt hotel fails in filling the expectations.

I had to walk over to 5th Ave and try to flag one myself or walk. Just inside the entrance is a flight of stairs to the lobby and while there is an elevator, it appears to be for the bellman. So I started to carry all my luggage up the stairs when halfway up, a bellman saw me and came to help me. Check in was quick and the bellman waited for me, carried my luggage up to my room, and set it up for me. The room was small!! I've stayed in many European rooms and this was just as small. It was about 12' x 12' with just enough room for a queen sized bed and two night stands. The bathroom was small with just enough room for the sink (no counter space!), a toilet, and the shower. It was nice and clean though. My biggest gripe was the morning I checked out. I headed out to the elevators around 8:15am with all my luggage. There were already 3 or 4 people waiting there. Well, it's a good thing they put chairs by the elevator because I waited 10 min for an elevator to go down. They have SIX elevators and only one appeared to be going up or down. The first one down that came was packed full (at which point one person waiting headed down the stairs). That same elevator came back up at which point one person got in, rode it up, and then rode it back down. Of course it was packed when it got to our floor again. Waiting for the elevator was making me late so in my heels and suit, I picked up my two pieces of luggage and proceeded to walk down the 7 flights of stairs to the lobby. And I wasn't the only one! There were tons of people in the stairwell dragging their luggage down. Then when I got to the lobby, I had to go down those extra stairs to the entrance. This time no one helped me. I asked the man at the door to flag me a taxi (the hotel is on a corner so I thought he'd at least try to get me a taxi on the street that wasn't closed) and all he did was tell me to go down to 5th Ave and get one there. So I rolled all my luggage over and after unsuccessfully trying to flag a taxi, a policeman saw me and helped me.

I was told to pack my bags and leave them in the room while we went out and that they would be moved for us. After breakfast the next day I thought I'd double check and was told that in fact I had to pack my bags, bring them down for storage and then put my name on a waiting list.

Certainly has a big lobby that's very 1920s grand. But of course you don't stay in the lobby. Our room was on the 17th floor. The basics were OK - large good quality bed, little street noise, walls solid enough to give you privacy, only one blood stain on the bed linen, etc. The rest was poor. Not enough hanging space for clothes, large and noisy heating units, cracked and flaking paintwork, dirty nets, old heavy brown furniture with plenty of marks and dents, nylon carpet that needed a good clean, big black cheap Phillips television with poor reception, florid decor all mismatched and gone drab. The bathroom was small to middling, the bath very small and getting grubby, the shower good, but with no extractor everything got misted and damp very quickly. A very basic and functional beige tiled bathroom. As with the bedroom, everything was approaching worn out (the hairdryer looked like a museum piece). Room service was adequate. You get through to an answerphone and they call you back a few minutes later. The staff hit you with the same patter every morning (gets tedious) and shamelessly dig for tips regardless of how long they kept you waiting. Service generally followed the same model. Plenty of syrup and mock concern, sure, but delivered with blatant unconcern for anything except the dollars in your wallet (tip low, or not at all, if you want to hear a sincere remark). The restaurant should be avoided. Food comes heavily salted and overcooked, my salad was memorably disgusting, the place anyway looks like Hell's anteroom, and prices are optimistic. For the same money, you'll get a great meal at The Oyster Bar just over the way at Grand Central Station. We wouldn't recommend Eammon's Bar (up the street) unless you just want convenience - the food there was warmed up and ordinary. Final score: Worst hotels exist and service was OK (apart from being mindlessly insincere). Room quality was poor (we were in a group of 12, everyone got a more or less shabby room). Location is good (bear in mind that Manhattan isn't half as big as you'd think, so being in midtown is only a modest bonus). Would we stay at The Roosevelt again? Unlikely.

The front desk employee was the nicest person and even gave us 2 complimentary breakfasts for the next day. It turned out that each breakfast buffet was $26 each, so right there we saved more than $50. And let me tell you, the breakfast is superb, with made to order omelettes and waffles, fresh bagels, pastry, croissants, etc, all kinds of fruit, pancakes, you name it. While we were doing the check in, the assistant manager emerged from a back room and said \"oh, the Rivera's are here!!!\". Maybe he just looked at the paperwork and saw our last name, but it certainly made us feel very welcome. The lobby is stunning and the staff, very courteous. The room was indeed small, compared to other hotels and resorts we have stayed in, but for New York, it was fine. The room was clean, with plenty of towels and the heater worked wonders. We hardly spent any time in the room--I guess that's how it's supposed to be when there are so many things to do in a city like NY. The hotel location can't be better, just one block from 5th Avenue, 3 blocks from Times Square and the Theatre District, and 3 blocks from the main subway/train station, where you can go anywhere. Can't beat the location, for the price. The lobby bar is also pretty nice at night.

We went with open minds having read mostly good (but sometimes bad) tripadvisor reviews. We were not disappointed though. The lobby was lavish and very grand - quick and efficient reception staff soon had us on our way to our room - all of the staff we came across couldn't have been friendlier. We had an ordinary standard room which was very spacious even with a king size bed, and larger than you would expect for a NYC standard hotel room. The bed was perfect, crisp and spotlessly clean bedlinen and luxurious scatter cushions. Nice lamps and furniture. The bathroom was spacious with very good quality (and far too many!) towels. The toiletries provided were also very good quality. The housekeeping service was first class and the cleanliness of the rooms was a credit to the staff. You hear horror stories about a lot of New York hotels - this certainly does not apply to the Roosevelt and remember, we were only staying in a standard room. We have stayed in some of the best hotels in the USA and I would not hesitate staying at the Roosevelt next time I am in New York. Having read some of the (very few) negative reviews of this hotel I certainly dispute the following: 1) Pushy and lazy staff and rude doormen: quite the opposite, they couldn't do enough for you and were never pushy. 2) brown water in handbasin: never saw this at all. 3) slow elevators: there were six elevators and they were there immediatly. 4) thin walls, able to hear next door guests: complete rubbish, we never heard a thing and we like a quiet hotel - we didn't expect it in NYC but our room (#1164) was exceptionally quiet. We did not use the bar or the restaurant so cannot comment on these. For breakfast we used a wonderful diner five mornings running called Nino's just round the corner on 46th St. whose omelettes I can thoroughly recommend. Try Bubba Gumps on Times Square for a fun dinner. I can find no fault with this hotel at all and look forward to my next stay at the Roosevelt when next in New York.

We were so satisfied with the room, that we never even asked to be moved to a different one. We heard very little noise coming from the streets, nor did we ever hear anyone in rooms on either side of us for our entire stay of 5 nights. We also asked questions every day at the concierge desk, and found them to be informative and very friendly. Because the hotel is located centrally, we walked most everywhere that we needed to go. For the times we needed to venture further than our feet would carry us, we took the subway. Grand central station is a short 5 minute walk from the hotel. Taxi service was also available any time, night or day. We even rode in a bike taxi one night and had a grand visit with the \"driver\". The barista at the little coffee kiosk, and the clerk in the gift shop also deserve special mention as they were always friendly.

The location is excellent, within walking distance of Central Park to the North, just a few blocks from Broadway and Times Square, and a pleasant distance from The Empire State et all. The hotel really is grand, which you will first notice upon arrival in the Lobby. Old school grandoise styling, which really shocked me for the price I paid, I often felt underdressed in such a smart Hotel! The room was large and the bathroom fine. Climate control, large TV, desk, large closet space etc. Housekeeping were excellent, on one occassion I left the room to escort a friend up to my room from downstairs.....upon leaving my room the maid asked if she could make-up the room...... I responded that I would be back up there in under 5 minutes, but she insisted........ and true to her word upon my return the room was immaculate! The maids were really overly keen sometimes to get that room cleaned! I had one problem when the toilet was blocked, which was fixed within 20 minutes of me calling down to reception. The room service was excellent (24 hours), as were the staff in the Business centre. Internet access there was billed by the half hour, but as I only used it for short periods of time they didn't bill me at all. The only problem I had during my entire visit was upon arrival: I arrived with two hefty suitcases and received no offer of help from any of the doormen. I struggled through the doors and up to reception where I collected my room key, and once again received no offer of assistance from the Bell boy, thus lugging my bags to my room on my own. This was the only major negative point really. The alcohol and phone calls are ridiculously over priced, so avoid them at all costs. Also the rooms are not soundproofed as advertised (perhaps this was because I was on the smoking floor, but I could hear everything going on in the hallway, and in the adjacent rooms! If you can put up with doormen who are only interested in large tips, and a few minor faults, you will absolutely LOVE the Roosevelt. For the price it is absolutely outstanding value.

By the time we had racked up 7 martinis and 2 beers, we asked politely that they take care of the bar bill and they did. The staff was polite and helpful. The elevators were our only problems. They were slow and add to that, the fact that there is alot of traffic from the large number of guests, it became an increasingly annoying thing to have to deal with. Beds were made but sheets may have been changed once every 2 days. I was not comfortable with the upholstered cushions and pillows on the bed as you know that they have not been washed for a while because there are no zippers and it is highly unlikely that they dry-clean it after every guest.

I have to say that I didn't feel the hotel lived up to the hype. It's an OK hotel but nothing more. I found it to be a rather soul less place with staff that didn't seem to care about the guests other than looking for tips. I have been to NY many times and didn't appreciate the doorman trying to con me into taking a hotel car for 15 dollars when we both knew that a cab for the same journey was only 8 dollars. My room was tidy enough but small, and had a very thin inter-joining door with the next door room, this was a problem when my neighbours arrived back a 3am every night and had a party in their room. The Roosevelt also has the noisiest plumbing I've ever experienced, it's hard to sleep throught the whooshing and clanking that begins at around 7am - bring ear plugs. Also everyone says this is a great location, why? Midtown is boring... Surely everyone goes to Greenwich Village and Soho in the evening, this hotel is 11 dollars in cab. Please don't think that I love to complain, I'm quite easily pleased but I felt that the reviews on this site need some balance.

I have to agree that the service is absolutely appalling and the noise is unbearable. We booked through expedia who falsely advertised that these rooms are sound proofed. Well, i can tell you they are not and even though it looks like the windows are double glazed, it is very shabby and lets in as much noise as if the windows were open! There were roadworks going on all through the night and we could hear what sounded like explosions at all hours. On top of that you can hear everything in the next room - every word in fact. When we arrived at the hotel we were not able to check in as they were running so late with the room cleaning. We left our bags and were told the bell staff would take them up - so we gave the guy $10. We came back at around 6.30pm and were given our room number, but the bags were still in the foyer. So another bell boy insists he takes them up - another tip. I had ordered champagne and strawberrries on arrival as a suprise for my partners birthday, but they had been sent to another room. The room we were given was tiny and dark - and this was supposed to be a superior room! We had also called prior to the trip to make sure we got a quiet room (i was dubious of soundproofing) and this room was far from quiet. We asked to change straight away, but were told we could not, we would have to do it the next day at 7pm. We came back the next day at 7pm, still no room. After complaining, the front desk girl checked again with housekeeping and then gave us a key to a room. Upon opening the door to this room, we find that it is already occupied! Can you imagine? So we complain to the manageress who upgrades us to a suite - still very dark and noisy but at least larger. However, whilst i was having a bath i heard the door open and a radio - it was the security guard who had let himself in without even knocking! We complained and were told that we should have informed the front desk we changed rooms. My partner pointed out that the manageress of the front desk had just given us the key and surely she should update her system. They insisted that this was our responsibility. We also tried to order room service which never turned up. And i won't even go into the time i tried to request some milk for coffee. Oh and thats another thing - you don't get tea and coffee facilities in your room - we got a coffee maker when we switched to a suite, but no milk. Now even in a travelodge you get tea and coffee! And finally, to add insult to injury, on the morning we left the maid barged in at 9am (without knocking) demanding to know when we would be vacating the room - check out isn't even until 11am! On a good note, the location is very central so if you can get to sleep in a battlefield - and be rest assured there are no quiet sides to this hotel (we were told this by staff), don't mind crap service, and are very small so you can fit in the tiny rooms, then this is the place for you.

After arriving on a red eye flight at 5am, we thought it may be possible to check in early, after others checked out. We have done this other times in New York. The front desk staff stated that their computers were down, and to come back in an hour. We did so, and still the computers were down, and were told that it didn't matter since their policy was to allow check in at 3pm. The computers came online and they \"preregistered\" us at 10am. I asked the lady if we could get the first available room in the class we booked, she didn't seem to think it would be a problem. I went back about 1/2 hour later to see if anything was available and the lady now at the front desk said, \"It is policy to allow check in at 3pm.\" I explained that I understood their policy, but would appreciate a room if available. She said, No. Finally, we found a different person at around 1pm to allow us to check in. They must have people every day who arrive early on red eye flights and it would be better \"policy\" to allow early check in if a room is available, and to train their front desk staff on acceptable customer service. Almost every other hotel allows this. While several of us were trying to get to a wedding rehearsal, the front door man was barely making any effort to get a taxi for us. There is a law in New York that if you get in a Taxi, they cannot refuse to take you somewhere within the city. We did not know this but the doorman should have. He let a young man cut in front of the elderly father of the groom and he told us, no taxi wants to take us to Queens. I found out later we should have gotten in the car and just told them where to take us, b/c they cannot refuse. Then, the doorman told us he could find us a car service for $80. He made every effort to get us a car service that was way more expensive than a taxi would have been b/c those services give him a cut of the $. Rediculous and a total ripoff. Upon checkout, we went to check our baggage. There was a long line at the bell desk. I got near the front when they said we all had to take our luggage down a flight of stairs to another place and wait in line there. I was alone with two bags and they did not offer me any assistance. What was worse, the lady next to me in line was prenant, with a child in tow, and several bags and they expected her to carry her own bags to a room downstair, then expected a tip for her hard work. The bellstaff argued in front of all the guests since they couldn't agree on how to do anything. This isn't rocket science, you take my bag, give me a ticket and then store it in a room. You do not make people take their bags all over the hotel, have them place it in a room, and then expect a tip. I want to know what they wanted a tip for, they did not do anything. Fine facilities, horrendous service. The staff should all be fired, and they should place management in place that knows how to train a staff on customer service. The behavior we witnessed was unacceptable, and I believe that motels provide better services than the Roosevelt hotel. There are other hotel in New York with equal facilities, even better location, and far superior service for the same price range.

In addition, my alarm was left set by the last occupant so that I was awakened at some early hour and could not go back to sleep. And last, and worst, was that my room was not cleaned at all so that I arrived back at midnight from a hard days work to find dirty towels and an unmade bed. This was probably due to the fact that the \"Do not distrub\" tag was on my door, although I do not remember putting it there but, as explained in the hotel policy, even if you do not respond by telephone they will clean your room even if such a sign is on unless specifically instructed not to. The Hotel management acknowledged my problems and was apologetic and nice enough to offer me a nights free accomodation in a junior suite when I return to New York.

I booked a superior room with a king size bed back in October and paid about $130 US. The room was very clean and most of the amenities were modern, considering the age of the hotel. I do know that the hotel had a soft goods renovation in 2003 and it showed. The bed and linens were extremely comfortable. The bathroom was also very well appointed, the shower pressure was good and towels were nice and thick. An exceptional value for what I paid. The best thing about the Roosevelt is its location at 45th and Madison. This is just central enough to many of the main attractions and the subway is just a couple of blocks away. I also appreciated that the hotel is located just far enough from Times Square to not feel too crowded. There are also lots of places to eat around the hotel, though this true of most of Mahattan. There are a couple of delis on the hotel block, one of which was open 24 hours and they carried just about everything under the sun. The only complaint I have is regarding the noise level in the room were staying in. I can't say that all rooms are noisy, obviously, but the walls in the one we were in were quite thin. The first couple of nights we were there I could hear my neighbours next door every time they spoke. I didn't hear anything after the first two nights, however, so this may just have been how loudly they spoke to each other. I could also hear the water pipes banging every so often.
