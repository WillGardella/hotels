The location is great, close to the subway and the city centre. It is surrounded by lots of bars and restaurants, but in a quiet, dead end street so no problems with outside noise. The room looked newly renovated and it was clean. All the people at the reception were very nice and friendly. The only issue I had was with indoor noises. The floors are lined with a linoleum that looks like wood. It looks nice, but it makes you hear every step your upstairs neighbours make. In fact, it sounds like there are elephants living there. This was a bit hard to deal with. Not just at night, waking you up out of sleep, but also if you want to relax in your room before you go out to dinner. Another thing is the thin separation between your door and that of your next door neighbours. There is only a stile as a separation, so when your next door neighbours put their key in the lock and walking into their room, it sounds as if they were going into your room. You can also hear the A/C unit, but I always sleep with earplugs so that didn't bother me half as much as the stomping aroung above my head. So because of indoor noise I rate this hotel as average. However, I think that you will get the same with lots of small hotels in this area so I am not sure if this should hold you back in booking this hotel. I paid 64 euro a night as a special offer through Expedia. I would not be prepared to pay the normal price for this hotel. The room was small, about 16 sq. metres including bathroom, but clean. There is no storage for your clothes expect for 5 hangers built into the wall. The only other option is to lay your clothes on the higher shelves in the bathroom, but I found they looked a bit too dusty. I was staying on the fourth floor and looked out onto the dead end street and into the appartments of people living opposite, but I didn't mind that. The bathroom was small,which is normal. The water of the shower doesn't all fall into the lowered part of the shower. Lots of it falls onto the higher strip of tiles that leads the water straight to the bathroom floor. That makes it impossible to take longer than 5 minute showers, otherwise the bathroom gets soaked. The safe in the room didn't work but maybe that could have been solved, I just couldn't be bothered to ask.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cA Pefect Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Sean B", "ReviewID": "UR125752286", "Content": "This hotel is located a central, safe and nice area.

Do NOT expect standards like those in other European cities. It is an old city and this is reflected in the style of the buildings. Typical Parisien hotels are small and rooms accessed up narrow staircases. Often standards are far lower than we are used to and the room rates still high. With a 2 star hotel, expect to pay 3 star prices. I have had some awaful experiences with hotels in Paris and so i was a little worried about this booking as I had secured such a low rate! \u00a350 per night for a double! I need not have worried! The Hotel Cite de la Rougemont is a real find. A little gem hidden away! Yes the rooms are small but have all recently been refurbished and have the real bonus of en suite shower rooms/bathrooms. The bedroom decor is modern and tasteful and the bathrooms clean and contemporary. There is a TV, hairdyer and phone in the room and all floors can be accessed by an elevator. The hotel foyer and breakfast room is still traditionally decorated in a typical Parisien style but this gives the building charm and warmth. The best asset are the staff who were all without exception lovely! All spoke good English and were helpful and informative. Another great bonus was the breakfast! 6 euros per person for a a typical continental offering. Fresh delicious baguette, croissant, jam, butter and cereals and fruit juice as well as a choice of tea, coffee and hot chocolate (a bonus if travelling with kids). You can just decide on the day if you want to take breakfast and dont have to book in advance. The breakfast room was never crowded and allowed a nice relaxing start to the day. It was far nicer and easier to take breakfast here rather than a local bakery. The hotel is tricky to find at first and is in a little side street that forms a sort of courtyard. It was lovely and quiet and yet a stone's throw from the metro and an array of restaurants, shops and bars including Galleries la Fayette and the Opera . Superb location for sightseeing and safer and more upmarket neighbourhood. I had my 8 year old son with me and felt safe walking back to the hotel at night. Overall, I cannot believe the value for money. If like me you want a central place to lay your head, clean, quiet and safe with lovely staff and maximum effort then look no further! I would definitely book again and make this my Paris base.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood value - clean.\u201d", "Author": "bengeorge", "ReviewID": "UR123876661", "Content": "The rooms are clean.

One thing to note - the rooms do have internet access but it's not wireless. I had my iPad, not a computer with an ethernet port.

Very easy to walk to north for Montmartre or south to Marais, Notre Dame, Palais Royal. 10 minute cab from Gare du Nord if taking Eurostar. Plus, it really is quiet and shielded from road noise. Lots of restaurants on the same road and not the usual tourist traps. Usually plenty of people around in the restaurants on Grand Boulevard till late at night, so felt safe coming back late. Inside, it's just been renovated and well done. Everything looks clean, stylish and simple. The hardwood floors are a nice touch--though because this is a 2 star, you are still going to hear some noise from other rooms, especially in the mornings when people are packing to check out. So this is not a place to sleep in until noon. The first room we had was really tiny--no room if you have anything bigger than a carry-on luggage. It also faced the front, which suffered some noise in the mornings from garbage pickup trucks. The second room was on a higher floor and faced the back--no view, but larger (reasonably for Paris) and more manageable for two people if staying for more than a couple of nights. Staff was lovely--particularly Ms Fang, who spoke English. Very happy to help and assist. We didn't experience any surly service as we have before in other Paris hotels. One of the bigger lifts I've seen in Paris, so no problem for those who can't climb stairs. No free wireless was a disappointment, only paid and cable access, requiring a laptop. No computer in the lobby for printing out boarding passes. If you're particular, would suggest bringing toiletries, as you just get soap and packets of bodywash/shampoo. Breakfast is just cereals, croissant/bread & jam, coffee & juice. Nothing fancy. Overall, this is a truly excellent value for a 2 star hotel in Paris.
