We picked this since it was close to the apartment we were renting but could not get for a consecutive 5-night stay. The hotel is located in a quiet area but 2-5 minutes away from restaurants and cafes. There are a couple of good bakeries (one right opposite the hotel, the other near Rue Larribe/Rue de Constantinople) - we relied on these for breakfast and skipped the one at the hotel. The hotel is very clean and so are the rooms & bathrooms. Room size is smaller than your average hotel in the US but in line with Parisian standards. The staff put up a baby bed for our son without we requesting for it so was a nice touch. Staff was very friendly. The lady at the reception one morning (and the kitchen staff) went out of the way to help get warm milk (no charge) for our son. Also helped call a cab for us when needed. The Villiers metro is minutes away (under 4 min.) & there are at least 2-3 ATM's within easy reach - again 2-4 min. away. Would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aurach bei Kitzbuehel, Austria", "Title": "\u201cPretty location and pleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "amankora", "ReviewID": "UR118969228", "Content": "Friends of mine live in this street and recommended this hotel.

As others have mentioned the bakery across the street is lovely and means you have a way of avoiding the overpriced breakfast at the hotel. (I stayed over Easter saturday/ Sunday and so the bakery was closed and I did have the hotel breakfast which was ok, but for 12 euros...!!) The room; Small but with lovely old style windows, short double bed (sheets and blankets, rather than duvet though were clean) good desk, TV with lots of international channels. Plenty of storage/ hanging space and a safe and minibar. Classic furnishings in dark colours (red, dark gold/yellow) Bathroom: Needs better lighting and would be better with a sliding door as is so small. Was lovely to have a bathtub with showerover though, Great toiletries (olive oil, rustic, simmilar to L'occitane- :-) French country style sink. Staff were helpful and arranged taxis etcet. Bar is small, but had everything, you just need to ask. Local area very good. Near park, metro and good local shops.

It is not 4 star so lacks details like someone to help with luggage, bathrobes etc. if that is what you are looking for A wide variety of prices quoted. We were part of a large party most of us paid E150 (at the top end looking at some reviews) but others paid even more E180!

Breakfast was very good, with nicely cooked bacon and fresh scrambled eggs plus the room where breakfast is served looks very nice. Staff was very friendly and spoke english. The hotel is located at the expensive and exclusive 8th arrondissement and very close to the Villiers metro station. I found the area safe and clean, with great restaurants and bars. I would highly recommend a visit to the famous Len\u00f4tre patisserie/traiteur which is just around the corner, absolutely delicious! If you are the sort of person who likes to spend a lot of time at the hotel, then you might get bored as there is no swimming pool, gym or films on TV. We only used it as a base for a few hours in the morning and late at night but it did exactly what we wanted it to do, to serve as a safe and comfortable base to explore Paris.

The room was very quiet, end of corridor overlooking a courtyard. The decor was pleasant and the room was a reasonable size for Paris. The hanging space was behind the headboard which was a good use of space, but only room for a few items (fine for a weekend). The bed was a small double (140cm) rather than king size (150cm) but comfortable. The bathroom was a bit cramped (with the basin behind the door), but decent shower with the usual shower screen that is too small so you soak the floor. Everything was clean and in good condition. It seemed to me that this hotel (or at least our room) was most suited to a single person on a business trip. However, we were perfectly happy there and had a good night's sleep (although short after staying out late to celebrate the win over France). The price of 170 euros seemed very reasonable considering the completely exceptional demand and high prices for accommodation that weekend. Can't comment on breakfast or other aspects of the hotel as we didn't use anything and did not have time to explore the local area. However, it was easy to get to and from (Villiers metro or 15-20 mins walk from Gare St Lazare).", "Date": "October 22, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Relais Monceau", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d229609-Reviews-Hotel_Relais_Monceau-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$153 - $257*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">85 Rue du Rocher</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75008</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515251", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/47/7c/477cdead8a41e7692af4733cdd6eeb8d11large.jpg"}}
