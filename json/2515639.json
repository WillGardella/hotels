Well the US Grant isn\u2019t exactly a boutique hotel rippling with eccentricities, after all it is in the same market as it\u2019s neighbours, but it has does have a certain individuality that come from it history. It is clearly a hotel which when built, sometime in the first half of the 20th century, had a sense of luxury and quality; the tasteful restoration has tried to capture some of this. Not everything about the hotel suited us, we found the only bar in the hotel a mixed blessing; it was relatively intimate, but in reality a little on the small side; some nights the live music was pleasant on other evenings it was annoying wall paper. The breakfast like wise had highs and lows, no one would recommend the Egg White Frittata and I wasn\u2019t over impressed with the poached eggs on ciabatta which was an eggs Benedict type of affair with a rubbery poached egg and a poor hollandaise sauce. On the other hand fresh egg omelette was excellent and both the shrimp frittata and the smoked salmon breakfast were very good. On the whole, if you\u2019re going to stay downtown in San Diego in one of the big hotels this is one of the more interesting, not the most luxurious and certainly not among the most expensive but very nice and with its own certain sense of style.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel at the edge of the Gaslamp Quarter\u201d", "Author": "jxw22", "ReviewID": "UR129138891", "Content": "I stayed here on business several years ago under a different owner.

First, the impression made by Magdalena at the desk could not have been better. Even though my room was not ready (which is perfectly fine, didn't expect it to be), her genuineness and constant follow up made quite an impression. Worth the wait! The banquets team was superb for our dinner Thursday night. The only thing that should have happened was that I should have been more diligent in getting their names. I believe one gentlemen's name was Tom who seemed to step in even more as needed and was quite knowledgeable about the specialty drinks. He constantly checked in on our end of the table. But they all gave a great experience which along with unbelievable course selection created a unforgettable night. I had a quick dinner at the bar Friday night and got to see Tom and Bruce at the Grant Grill. What a fine example of team work. They knew their returning customers, educated on the wines specifically (the guest next to me was pretty detailed in what they wanted), and how they helped each other's covers added a nice touch to what can sometimes be a territorial area. Great job. Finally, I have to give credit to Nathan. He showed an all around great presence in the lobby and around the hotel. A great addition to your team and he will definitely grow the high standards already being displayed. Thanks again for making this a great experience.

Around 10 am, after the first night there, a male housekeeper burst right into my room, without knocking, while me and my girlfriend were... occupied with each other. Needless to say she was very embarrassed, and this experience ruined our entire trip. I told the hotel staff about this incident, and they forwarded me to the hotel director who offered me a bottle of wine as an apology. Of course I accepted, as I figured this is quite a nice hotel with a very expensive taste in alcohol, at least it should be a good bottle. Nope, I was given a cheap $15 bottle of wine that wasn't even on the hotel's alcohol menu. What a joke, this was just a huge slap in the face. To top it all off, I asked twice to have a refrigerator brought up to my room. The first time I asked was when I first arrived, the second when I asked the concierge over the phone. Both times my request went unfulfilled. I ended up placing my perishables in the hotel mini-bar fridge out of desperation, which ended up charging multiple items to my hotel tab (due to the weight adjustment). I ended up owing about $100 in drinks I never even drank. By the end of the trip I was just so sick of everything, I didn't even care to check out. By the way for those wondering, apparently the US Grant thinks a coke not even the size of a small can is worth $4.95, and a small 8oz red bull is $9.95. Both of which are still inside the mini-bar. I guess I shouldn't forget one last thing, when we arrived my girlfriend (being the superstitious person that she is) asked the Bellhop if the hotel was haunted, since the hotel is indeed over 100 years old. Without skipping a beat, the bellhop tells her it is indeed haunted and tells her a few scary stories not paying attention to the face I was making to tell him to stop. This completely RUINED her experience, she was frightened most of the night and thought every little sound she heard was a ghost. How could someone from the hotel staff do this?! I spent over $1,000 to stay here 3 nights, and my girlfriend was completely distraught the entire trip. Needless to say, I won't be staying here again. I'd rather stay at a motel 6, at least I know their staff wont forget that I'm in my room, they'll be happy to give me a mini-fridge, and they will give me complimentary breakfast.

You might go right pass it if you don't pay attention. We arrived to the hotel and were greeted by a very professional valet parking staff who had big smiles and addressed us as Mr. and Mrs. The professsional and friendly valet staff was consistent throughout our stay. We got 2 bottles of water from them everyday \"for the road and the little guy\". The young front desk staff was very friendly as well. Our son had a cold with temperature during our stay, the staff opened the closed gift shop and offerred tylenol (though we had to decline because we had to use children's tylenol). Overall, we couldn't be happier with the customer service. No complaint! ROOM: Our room is on the 4th floor facing the Westgate hotel, which wasn't a good thing because of their all day construction. Not very good for napping or sleeping in. Our little one was quite unhappy to be waken up so early in the day (around 5AM...) The room overall is more like a suite. The king bed was very comfortable with a ton of pillows. The decor is quite dated and dark, but we weren't bothered much by it. There was a huge mirror on the floor leaning against the wall (not safe if you have a toddler). The bathroom is nice and clean and has everything that we needed, from cotton balls to magnifying mirror and a lot of clean fresh towels with timed lightning. There were always at least 2 clean bath robes for us each day. We got a call every night to find out if we wanted our bed to be turned. Oh, there were 2 compliment wate bottles in our room everyday, which were very nice. ROOM SERVICE: The maids were very friendly and attentive. We had to use the long pillows to cover the pointy sharp night stand to protect our son from getting hurt. The maid understood that and didn't touch them (without us telling). When we saw them on the hallway, they were always polite and friendly to our little one. We ordered in-room service for dinner one night. The food was excellent, exceeded our expectations. We had the fillet mignon with seasonal garden veggies. Everything was very tasty and hot. We could tell that the veggies were very fresh. Our son was happy with his mac and cheese. The onion rings were very good, just like Red Robin. The room service staff was very warm and courteous when he delivered the food. We got a phone call about an hour after our dinner from the conceirge to see if we were satisfied with our meals. LOCATION: One word - EXCELLENT! The trolley is right in front out the door. The mall is one block away, which has a lot of nice shops and restaurants. Very close to Little Italy and about 10 min walk to the Harbor. 5 min drive away to the San Diego Zoo, Spanish Village, and the models train museum (you can take the trolley there). The SeaWorld is about 10 min drive away. The San Diego Sarafi Park is about 20 min away (you will have to go on the freeway to get there, but quite straightforward).", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lafayette, Louisiana, United States", "Title": "\u201cGreat Experience\u201d", "Author": "athow", "ReviewID": "UR127086764", "Content": "Spacious room, clean, great decor, super helpful and friendly staff.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAwesome, awesome hotel\u201d", "Author": "anshu a", "ReviewID": "UR127000030", "Content": "Hotel is awesome, staff is even better.

It is also just magnificently decorated in such a way that combines classic luxury with a modern touch. However, the highlight of this hotel is that each of the staff members work hard to go above and beyond their duties and keep you happy no matter how many times you bug them. They are very friendly and welcoming (with the exception of one particular front desk staff member who's name escapes me but he worked the desk at 4am). I found that I would almost find excuses to interact with the hotel staff.' The bedsheets could be softer but in no way impeded our sleep. Someone mentioned the sink was too large and took up too much space but I found that the sink actually increased tabletop space and the bathroom was very beautiful. I particularly liked the art above the beds. (Although they seemed like random scribbles, they actually depicted engaging scenes (such as musicians playing saxophones an a day on the beach)) There are a few drawbacks though. First, the hotel only offers valet parking for $35/day. There are $10/day options available around the downtown area, but they do not allow in-and-out privileges. Because I was going in and out often, I ended up using a combination of free 3 hour parking (with validation) at the Horton Westfield across the street and street parking from 6pm-8am. Second, although I was in a deluxe corner room on the 7th floor, there was quite a bit of street noise which could be a problem for some people (fortunately, my friends and I are heavy sleepers). Sound insulation is definitely a problem here. Third, the rooms are beautiful but are a little small. Find a way to upgrade to a suite if possible. (Unfortunately, I was not extended this option) Lastly, this hotel does get some high-class clients and although my friends and I were dressed cleanly in business casual, the high-class clients would often give us uncomfortable looks. The hotel can't help that but it does make us feel less welcome.

I was expecting an old hotel, but I figured that it couldn't be THAT bad since it's part of the AmEx Fine Hotels & Resorts program. Wow, I was wrong. We were initially brought to room 701 (SPG floor). I noticed some things hanging from the ceiling. I had seem something similar in another TA review, so my husband pulled one down to check it out. I thought it was dust or cobwebs, but it started MOVING. I just uploaded a video to TA that shows the bug crawling out of it's pod. There were several of these on the ceiling over the bed. What's really gross is that we were NOT in the same room as the previous TA reviewer... so this is a widespread problem in the hotel. I showed our video and the moving bug to several people (bell, front desk manager, housekeeping manager, etc.) and no one seemed surprised. We were told that we could be moved to either room 702 or 729 (no upgrade) and that they would consider giving us some extra Starwood points. Umm, we just found larvae in our room... and you're offering extra points?! Unfortunately, all of the hotels in the general area were booked because of the conference, so we were stuck at this disgusting place. After a lot of back-and-forth and 3 hours of wasted time, we went to room 702. We thought that the hotel would do SOMETHING... wine? No. Breakfast? No. Upgrade? No. I even told them that this video was going to end up on TripAdvisor and YouTube asap, but they could not have cared less about the cleanliness or reputation of the hotel. The manager that posts on TripAdvisor was nowhere to be found. Upon check-out, my husband expressed his disgust and they offered to reimburse us for about $90 of incidental charges... which is basically nothing compared to the cost of this hotel. Unfortunately, this wasn't our only problem with the hotel. Everything is dirty... not just old... but dirty. I have stayed in a lot of historic hotels and this one really should be shut down. Several things in the room were broken: lights, furniture, etc. The hotel is extremely dark, as are the rooms and bathrooms. Even fixing the lights in the bathroom didn't provide adequate lighting for getting ready. It was also difficult to have the room cleaned. We asked to have the sheets changed, and after 3 days of sleeping on the same sheets, I called housekeeping to bring me the sheets so that I could change them myself. See my attached picture to see the sheets that they provided... they didn't even cover the bed! When I called housekeeping to get another set, it took almost 2 hours at night for them to bring them when we were trying to go to bed. Also, forget about turndown service at this hotel. Turndown service happened twice in the four nights that we stayed at the hotel. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I will never, ever consider staying there again. I plan on sending letters to AmEx FH&R, Starwood, and the conference organization that suggested this hotel. I have never had such a gross experience in a hotel. To make matters worse, the hotel had no interest in making this up to us. Please do yourself a favor and consider any other hotel in the area.

If folks are scared of seeing a few homeless men, they shouldn't travel. Period! We were very happy with the room although it was noisy with the construction across the street. It was very clean and had everything we needed, including complementary water bottles and safe.

Because we were lucky enough to score this room, we entertained a group of friends before dinner which was fun. The service was great - everyone we encountered was very helpful and super nice. If I'm going to be nit-picky, our breakfast was a little late one morning but when we called, they told us it was on it's way & it arrived shortly.

All of us were thrilled and excited about staying at the US Grant. Our stay was both relaxing and disappointing at the same time. The hotel in general is lovely but we definitely did not have a 5 star experience. Pros: *beautiful lobby *friendly staff *really comfortable beds *great shower head *coffee (which we had to order from room service for $9 not knowing that apparently we could have requested to have them bring a coffee pot to our room) was served with bone china teacups and saucers which was really nice and the breakfast we ordered one morning was absolutely delicious Cons: * unless you have a suite the rooms are incredibly small and the pictures on their website are deceiving. we had no furniture in our room except the beds and the desk and dresser which is fine if all you are doing is sleeping but if you want to hang out in the room at all everyone has to sit on the beds together which is kind of awkward. *their website also says that \"an executive desk with writing pad and telephone invites the guests to take advantage of Wi-Fi\" which they tell you when you get to your room you have to pay for FYI *typically the first thing we do when we get a room at a hotel is go to the window and check out the view. we were greeted with the most excessive amount of bird feces splattered on the windows and caked in piles on the window sill that I have ever seen in one place. I actually laughed out loud. I realize what a nuisance birds can be but there are ways to deter them from landing places and at a historical hotel and a luxury collection hotel it was a real shame to have to look at that every time we walked to the bathroom or wanted to look outside. *coming back from dinner the first night we were greeted in the hallway by a cockroach who chased us to our room. Again, comical but really not what you want to see at a really nice hotel. motel 6 maybe, but not the US Grant. *we also were not too thrilled to discover what we have now determined to be about 15 small cocoons of some sort hanging from our ceiling and brown stains maybe from someone throwing something at the ceiling. At first my husband thought maybe they were spit wads or something that some kids who maybe got left in the room too long might have thrown at the ceiling but upon further investigation we are pretty sure some type of bug was living in them at one point. gross. * our ''300-thread-count-linens'' were lovely but were ripped on one of the beds and there was no way the person putting them on the bed could not have noticed it and they put them on anyway. nothing says luxury like ripped sheets. All in all we had a good stay but would not go back again unless we had points we needed to use up. It has become a running joke now with my husband and I that the Starwood Preferred Guest floors at these hotels have the worst rooms in the hotel because this is not the first time we have been given a room where we feel its one of those rooms they always have to move people out of and they really should not be renting them out at all.

The rooms were nicely appointed and the old hotel construction provided 10 ft+ ceilings in my room.

The hotel is marvellously located in San Diego to simply have a short walk to the shops, restaurants and historic areas. We did not dine in the hotel but did use room service on one occasion and it was superb. We are Starwood cardholders and check-in went very smoothly. However, here is a TIP for guests. We had booked a suite and the room we were given was perfectly okay in terms of decoration etc but it was extremely small and certainly small by American standards. It was on one of the higher floors. The room was very odd because there was insufficient room for two bedside cabinets so whoever was sleeping on one side of the bed had nowhere to put a watch or a glass of water. The lighting was also quirky. The area for watching the television was very small with an enormous two seater sofa seemingly filling that part of the room and the bathroom was not only cramped but seemingly badly designed. For example, the basin was in a corner which made it impossible to lean over it and there was nowhere to put a wash bag or anything else for that matter. We immediately raised this with the reception and much to their credit they immediately accepted that it was a rather small suite and that another would not be available until the next day. True to their word, the next day we were put in a suite of enormous proportions, almost the equivalent of an apartment where we remained for the rest of our stay. The larger suite was on the seventh floor. We were impressed by the frankness and helpfulness of the staff but our TIP would simply be, if you have booked a suite, don't accept a small one. There are a large number of suites of much bigger proportions than the one we were given in the beginning. That said, the US Grant is \"the\" place to stay in San Diego and we would have no hesitation in recommending it.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San diego", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel in San Diego.... 911 is a lucky number here\u201d", "Author": "Webpuccino", "ReviewID": "UR123476072", "Content": "This hotel is by far the best Starwood property in San Diego. Within blocks of this property are two Westin Hotels, W hotel and Sheraton Suites. When you walk into the lobby, you almost forget that you just stepped off of Broadway into a palatial lobby that reminds you of the grandeur that the property was known for when the doors opened over a century ago. The property is not quite the same as you would expect but better. Upon driving up Broadway, you see a very stately white stone/marble building with a warm blue hue and little did you know that you have stumbled upon one of the most luxurious and best hotels in the city. The lobby is spacious and entrance way a grand opening for what will soon to be the most amazing hotel in S. California. This hotel is an architect's dream in that the restoration of this property in that crown molding is preserved as well as architectural features of the property including ornate plasterwork from the original building. The rooms are spacious, quiet and very nice. Flat panel TVs are located in the room in addition to the Bose sound system with superior sound quality. Personal individual coffeemakers using illy coffee pods are also found in the rooms. The rooms feature beautiful dark maple floors with an oriental-like carpet giving one the sense of luxury. The hotel features Remede amenities similar to those found in the St Regis chain from Aspen to Rome. The walkin shower was awesome with excellent water pressure. The robes are made from the finest Egyptian cotton and the slippers are embroidered with the name of the hotel. One of the most thoughtful things was finding chocolates on the pillow during the evening turn down service in addition to the very warm welcome letter that separates this property from its' competitors. The parking valet will have cold bottles of water waiting for you when you pick your car up without having you ask. The floors are decorated with bronze indian statues and are very nice giving you a sense of the heritage found in the property with the current owners. The property has a screaming wifi service which is great and features a beautiful workout room. The restaurants look nice and on my last day here, I plan to try them. The hotel is in the heart of downtown and within walking to the Gaslamp Quarter so there are many options. I could not find a better place to stay. Hotel's valet parking is 35 dollars/night which is not bad comparing it to the W or Sheraton Hotels where parking is 32 dollars/night with in/out privileges. The staff was amazing and my thanks go out to Hollie from the business sales dept to all of the hotel associates whom made this an awesome stay. I cannot wait to return.

When I asked for the Sunday New York Times (which they do not carry) they offered both to get one for me and asked if I wanted one daily. (I did and they provided it.) - History: Even for non-history buffs, a tour of the hotel's photos is a must do. What was disappointing: - My room: If you can avoid room 329 or others like it, DO. Teeny, tiny, with a king bed but only one side w/ a table and lamp. It was dark because one could not leave the shades open - the room overlooked a portion of part of an overhang (littered with cigarette butts and trash) - and looked into (directly into!) a number of other rooms. There were so few lights in the room and bathroom that working, reading, or putting on makeup were a challenge. - Bathroom: Ditto teeny tiny and badly lighted. They have put a \"ledge\" on the toilet tank top but there is NO space around the bowl sink. (Stunning sink; totally bad for anyone 5'3\" and shorter; no counter space; sink appeared to have the spout stopped up - perhaps lime deposits? - and the trickle of water was a problem.) The shower head was ok but reaching it to adjust it was a problem for .. anyone 5'3\" and shorter. And it's a stall shower w/ no ledge for feet for shaving one's legs. - Distance from elevators: When I checked in I asked for a room not far from the elevators. It appears that many of the better rooms are a hike from the elevators. It's ok if your mobility is great; not so otherwise. - Elevators: Odd that one has to use a key card to push a floor but once 1 person has done so, anyone can. If this is for safety, it is missing. - Accessibility: I realize this hotel is no doubt grandfathered re ADA and the ADAA. However, even the elevator doors are narrow and someone using a walker or wheelchair may have trouble entering because of width and the short time the elevators stay open once they arrive. (There are numerous elevators and getting to the one that is open is not easy in the amount of time given.) - Gift shop/coffee: I learned that if one wants a coffee maker in one's room, asking is the only way. It wasn't offered at check in. The gift shop where they also have coffee was not open during the week and only limited hours on the weekend. I gather there are coffee places around the hotel but if one does not want to leave, it is odd not to have it available. (One can get a cup of coffee to go at Grand Cafe.) - Expensive wi-fi and wired internet. Need I say more? Clients have considered this hotel for meetings. If you do, or for leisure or biz travel, learn more about the room types and locations. For room 329, perhaps a person staying one or two nights who travels with few toiletries might be ok but .. not otherwise.

As you enter the lobby to go to the front desk, you realize you have entered a world of elegance, with a lot of character and class. It takes you back to history, and I can imagine how it's like when the hotel first opened many many years ago. From the chandeliers, the silk carpets, and decor, it was absolutely beautiful, and full of history. It was also decorated for Christmas and it was simply amazing. We got upgraded to the deluxe room on the 7th floor overlooking the San Diego skyline and the Westin Horton Plaza. If you can, upgrade to the deluxe room. The deluxe room is huge and comfortable. As everyone said here, the location is outstanding, just outside is the Westin Horton Plaza which we did some Christmas shopping and the Gaslamp district, has so many bars and restaurants, and great for nightlife. One of the reviewers mentioned that the US Grant can sometimes be overlooked, esp compared to another historic hotel we stayed at years ago in San Diego-The Hotel Del Coronado. Although the Hotel Del has a lot of history as well, the US Grant to me exceeds the Hotel Del. The rooms are definitely larger with the US Grant. There's also so many tourists that tour the Hotel Del, at times it gets too crowded in the common areas., which can be a negative. The US Grant to me is less commercialized than the Hotel Del, which is a big advantage. The US Grant is definitely San Diego's best kept secret. Lastly, the staff is amazing, and they treat you first class without being over the top. They understand customer service and are very sincere about it. If you get a chance, stay at the US Grant during the holidays, it's really absolutely beautiful with all the Christmas decorations inside the hotel. And outside, they light up the hotel with all the Christmas colors at night. The only negative-the room service prices are so high- but that's with every hotel we've stayed in.

Complimentary water, ear buds for the TV screens on the machines, towels and fresh fruit were in the gym for our use. All staff members are truly there to please the guests. From the staff at the concierge desk, valet, front desk, to housekeeping and room service the service is friendly, helpful and genuine. We especially enjoyed the turn down service at night.

In the top ranked hotels I\u2019ve stayed at, all staff are polite and pleasant. However, The US Grant staff are all genuinely committed to the guests. A pride in their work is evident in everyone, from the general manager to housekeeping. Alberto, in the Grant Grill, was charming, and his recommendations about the menu were perfect. Like everyone else in the organization, he brought information and an attitude directed at the success of our stay that is typically what defines a concierge. At the concierge desk, Mark is charming, encyclopedic in his knowledge, and genuinely solicitous of a guest\u2019s satisfaction. Demi, the guest loyalty coordinator, assured our loyalty to the US Grant forever. She saw that we had spectacular accommodations, and enhancements that made our anniversary celebration one that will be remembered forever. Like many others on the staff, she eagerly shared hotel history, including the great story about the restored painting where Wyatt Earp had shot out U.S. Grant\u2019s eye. When I asked to meet the general manager to tell him about his wonderful staff, it was clear why the staff has a familial feel and uniform commitment. When the front desk person called to tell him that I wished to speak with him, the general manager asked him how he was that day. Watching his face, it was clear that this solicitation was not unexpected. The general manager spoke with such pride of his hotel, and it became clear why everyone on staff shared that sense.

The general manager spoke with such pride of his hotel, and it became clear why everyone on staff shared that sense. In selecting these four individuals for praise, it is largely due to the limits of my memory, and an attempt to be concise. The service of every individual at the hotel was superlative. The Grant is a beautiful, historic hotel. Magnificently restored, it has no signs of the century it has been in existence. The opulence of the lobby is enchanting the moment you enter the hotel. That beauty continues throughout the hotel. Guests who review hotels on sites like hotwire and tripadvisor often seem to strain to find negatives in their evaluations. Some might complain about the noise level in the downtown site. However, earplugs accompany savvy travelers anytime they sleep away from the familiarity of home or on board the Petri dishes with wings that masquerade as commercial aircraft. If you have to find something to complain about, you will find it anywhere. The complete experience of the US Grant is something any traveler would revel in.

It was a truly unforgettable night and speaks to the quality of service at the US Grant. Onto hotel itself... Beautiful historic building, our room seemed to be recently renovated, very clean but a bit small, even though we had a Deluxe room. Although that's perfectly normal for historic hotels as they must work with building design. Complimentary water in our room was a pleasant surprise, you just don't get that at many hotels anymore... So why 4 stars and not 5? While the hotel location is very convenient, right next to the Gas Lamp district, that comes with a lot of noise... party goers, traffic noise and on the weekend we stayed there, Occupy San Diego demonstrations. I realize that the hotel tries to keep the historic charm going, but you can hardly sleep on party nights and sound proofing their windows should be a priority.

Albeit very short (just one day, during the Halloween weekend), it was just as we had imagined it would be ... and more! We arrived and was able to check-in and lay our bags down in the room within minutes. Although purchased online through Hotwire for a standard room, we were put into a superior room, larger corner room. This room was FANTASTIC. Sweeping views of Downtown. Super quiet floor, absolute one of my favorite rooms at the hotel (right up there with a Junior Suite we stayed in last time). I guess my husband dropped a hint that it was our anniversary, because when we returned after happy hour drinks --- you should really check out the bar ... it has quite the drink selection and the ambiance is fantastic --- we found a plate of truffles and strawberries waiting for us. And as I traditionally do there, we ordered breakfast in. Breakfast in bed, truffles and chocolate, Sunday morning news/football, and bathrobes at the Grant has to be one of my favorite experiences in the whole world. I have stayed at the US Grant on several other occasions, and this hotel is, by far, my favorite. There is just something about the extreme luxury and elegance that the hotel offers that is hard to put my finger on, but it just hits what I love in all the right spots. Unlike other 5-star hotels anywhere I have stayed, the Grant is not pretentious or in-your-face expensive-looking, it just provides a top-notch, top-quality, easy stay for both traveller and visitor alike. The customer service offered is also some of the best around. When my husband solved my baked potato craving (I know, from Wendy's across the street at 1am), he forgot to bring a plastic spork. The wait staff brought up some utensils right away. I was able to have my $1 potato with silverware and a linen napkin. :) (Sorry, US Grant.... I love your food but woke up that night really wanting that cheap stuff, too!) Everyone from reservations to front desk to waitstaff to cleaning crew... they all do a tremendous job and are there to just assure your stay is a safe and excellent one. Also, the hotel's prime location makes is walking distance to anywhere we'd like to go in the Gaslamp. Valet parking is easy in and out.

We had a room the 8th floor looking out towards broadway, there was a split where we had a kind of lounge area with a 2nd TV. The beds are comfortable, with top quality products in the bathroom, my only gripe is the designer wash bowl, which sits higher than a standard one, and the designer tap which can be a bit faffy! The payoff is you have plenty of fluffy towels. However each room has a different work of art painted on the headboard which are nice. And I've never had a trun down service before where they put a towel on the floor beside the bed so you're feet don't touch the carpet. The ice machine was difficult to find as it was on the floor below, which is easily accessible as this hotel was born in the days when people used stairs (1910).

I had contacted the hotel ahead of time when they sent me an email and unfortunately they never returned my email. Why ask for guests to contact if they won't take the time to respond? Called in about the possibility of an early check in around 1230pm on the 13th and was told that the room was already set to be checked into. Arrived around 1pm and suddenly they are not sure and have to get in touch with housekeeping. After 15 minutes of waiting I ask the front desk for status and they have to make another call. Another 10 minutes later and finally we get checked in when the room had been ready an hour before according to the staff member i originally spoke to. Room was fine, but im glad I was able to find it at a lower price on a competiors website so that the price was ok and i did earn 2000 starwood points for the low price guarantee that i applied for. So why the 1 rating? well when i checked in I wanted to store some beverages in the fridge, but they had a mini fridge that was activated by movement. There was a note saying they could deliver a fridge to the room, so i called in for it. Unfortunately they were all out, but the person on the phone told me that I could take items out and that they would note my account that I wasnt using anything from the mini fridge but had taken the items out so that we could place out beverages. On check out day, my folio was under my door and the correct amount was listed on it, obviously if the fridge had detected the movement of items and autimatically charged me for them they would have shown up on this folio. Im sure you know what happens next.... A month later I receive my spg amex card(yes U.S. Grant, I am both an spg member and a loyal spg amex card holder as well) and my bill is $70 more than it should be!!!! WOW, lied to by the front desk, and by whomever printed out my folio. Tried chatting with an spg agent about the issues, but they wound up closing the chat before we had finished the discussion! Chat agent Sarah H must work at the U.S. Grant and work at spg chat on the side! Finally had the issue resolved by calling hotel and speaking to the manager, I was given a measly 500 starwoods points for my inconvenience. Had I been aware of the issue and been on site to dispute im sure that I would have received greater compensation for my troubles, but what do they care, i've long since checked out. I had an issue arise across the street at the Westin Horton Plaza that I brought up during my stay, and they took care of resolving the issue in a professional manner and I felt treated like a valuable spg member. The U.S. Grant, well they brushed up their nose at me and didnt find me worthy enough I guess. This property has lost a loyal spg member, and I WILL NOT recommend it to any of my many friends who frequent san diego as a property they should patron.

That said, if you are a heavy sleeper and/or do not mind the likely annoying zero dark thirty wake up and can get back to sleep quickly, then you might love this place. Also on the negative side is there is not much drawer space for clothes as there are no chest of drawers to place your clothes in. And as for the bathroom weight scale, I do not understand why you would want your guests to weigh themselves on a glass weight scale, if they might come to consider that there are getting fat and might want to skip dinner. Also, I appreciate the free water alot as that was a huge plus, but please do not tempt me with a bottle of wine near the television that does not have a clear sign that should read, \"not free.\" Anyway, I smartly figured it was not free. Now, there are many good things to staying at this plush downtown hotel. The location is superb and you can walk a block south to Panera Bread and the nice outdoor mall, and 4th & 5th avenue top notch restaurants are just another block or so away. Also, the service at the Grant is the best possible that it could be as they will as much as they possibly can to help you or make things right for your stay there. If you do not like your room and there are rooms available on a higher floor they will definitely take care of you, and likely a higher upgrade too if you were not happy with your first room. There is free Wi-fi in the lobby and the restaurant so consider that too, but it will cost you if you want it in your room. And you will love the large very nice showers with swinging glass door - would love that in my house! Another thing I did not like was that they insist that you cannot personally handle the luggage carts and that is another way they can collect a tip from you. But not necessarily a big deal. I just know that I could have done it myself with no problem. Also, the parking fee is steep at $32 and should not be assessed if you do not take your car out that day. But you do not have much choice if you have your car since you cannot leave your car in a street space overnight due the street sweepers. On a final note, if you are a light sleeper ask for a room on a higher floor, otherwise you might not can stand more than a few nights if the noise bothers you. Besides that, if you do not mind the expense and want to be near the action, then this is a prime spot for you.

I'm giving the hotel a \"very good\" rating because it truly is so very lovely and inviting. I love the old brass mail box next to the elevators for instance as it reminds you of a time gone by that was romantic, gentle and patient.

The first night was terrible, the AC simply would not get the room cold enough and I was miserable, at 11:30 I called down to the desk to have them send me a fan. Half an hour later, still hot and uncomfortable and tired, I called back down asking where the fan was. The front desk did not know the status so I asked for a followup call with more information. That call never came. 15 Minutes later I called down yet again asking for a status, the same situation happened but with a different staff member, I asked for a return call and no call came back. About 15-20 minutes later the fan arrived covered in dust. With the help of the fan I made it through the night and when I complained in the morning the staff was fantastic about making things right. The manager on duty did an amazing job and put us in an large and incredible suite. She took our number and said she would give us a call when it was ready. After getting the call and coming back, we went up to the room to find someone else's luggage there, and not ours as well as the headboard to the bed on the floor having fallen off the wall. After bringing this up to her she again was very apologetic and said she would get it fixed right away. And that she did. The room was very nice with 2 large bathrooms one with a fantastic tub. Sadly things were just still off from what I would expect for $300+ a night. There was what looked like animal droppings in the corner of the window, it may have just been a massive pile of dirt, but neither is expected. There was a rip in my sheets I noticed the next morning. When trying to turn on the news in the living room, I noticed only one of the TVs actually worked. While we stayed there we ate 3 times at the onsite restaurant and I will say I was very impressed. The breakfast was very possibly the best I have had in my life, both the french toast and the waffles are to die for. The Juice was fresh and with a large variety, over all I am very very happy with the breakfast. Dinner was OK - the service was impeccable, absolutely top notch, and their staff made us feel special and welcomed. Both of us ordered steak, she ordered the $38 one and I ordered the $48 one. Now I am a steak snob, and her steak was fantastic, cooked perfectly and packed with flavor. My steak was mediocre at best, not what I would consider to be fine dining in any respect. When I brought it up, they offered to recook the steak, but I declined - I ended up eating less than half of it.

It is a short walk to the harbour (USS Midway, Coronado Ferry, Trolley, Harbour Cruises, Maritime Museum and Seaport Village), so no need for a car and the resulting $38/day parking fee). Cabs are plentiful and cheap, as are town cars (see the valet). You could also rent a car for the day as we did if you want to venture to the beaches or up the coast. The concierge can get you a good deal. The hotel itself has been elegantly renovated with every modern convenience; while still retaining its original charm. It is obvious from the moment you walk through the door that this place is incredibly well managed. We were treated like royalty at every turn, and we used almost all the services (reception, lounge, concierge, valet, room service, etc). Before I forget; the beds were heavenly. We even pulled the covers back to note the mattress make and brand so we could get the same one at home! Housekeeping was discreet and thorough. The entire hotel was spotlessly clean! All in all, a fabulous hotel with incredible staff. Tips: Rent a car by the day to avoid the exorbitant parking fee, eat/drink in the lounge during happy hour or be prepared to pay big $$$. One note: some earlier reviewers commented that the hotel is in a seedy area, but don't let this deter you. The back of the hotel faces the still under-developed north part of downtown, but in 3 directions there are restaurants, shops and people galore. There is nothing to see or do north of Broadway, so you will likely never venture in that direction anyway. If you do, as we did late one night, you will be perfectly safe. There are a few (very harmless) homeless people that are drawn into the area because there is a church handing out blankets and food a little further afield.

It was my boyfriend\u2019s birthday and also the day of a charity 100 mile bicycle ride he had organized. I was following the riders in my car from Huntington Beach to San Diego and supplying them with food and drinks along the way. I had previously spoken with Jeff Josenhans of the Grant Grill and arranged for a post-ride cocktail and dinner celebration, with a custom cake for my boyfriend. I called ahead that morning and by a stroke of fabulous luck, got Julie Larkin on the phone. I asked if it would be possible to arrive a little early to decorate the suite with birthday balloons and congratulations signs. (No tape on the walls of course!) Upon my arrival, social host Michael Curry was wonderful in helping me with a carload of luggage, gear and decorations. I then went to the Grant Grill and met with Jeff Josenhans, who had already arranged for a reserved section for my group, had already taken care of the cake, and even took some decorations from me for the table. As if that weren\u2019t enough, I then met with Julie Larkin who informed me that not only did I get above and beyond my FH&R upgrade, but that she had upgraded us to a bi-level Presidential Suite! From Rita Casares at the front desk, to Jeff and Michael and Julie, the entire staff offered to help me blow up balloons and even decorate the suite. When my boyfriend and the other riders arrived at your hotel, they were greeted with applause from the staff. They felt like rock stars! Our time in the Grant Grill was wonderful, and his cake was spectacular! And the special touches in the room (fruit plate and sparkling water) for his birthday were so thoughtful. All in all, it was a truly magical weekend. And when we got back home, he proposed! I will forever connect the most important day of my life, with my weekend at the US Grant. All my best, C.

The first time we stayed here, we got a deluxe king room. It was fabulous! It was so spacious and, since they are all corner rooms, there are plenty of windows. The bathroom was spacious as well. When we decided to return, I wanted to book the deluxe king room. Unfortunately, there were non available for our stay. So, I booked a Legacy Suite. I expected it to exceed my expectations. Instead, I felt a little disappointed. First, it felt cramped. There is barely a foot between the wall and the bed (closest to the window). The bathroom was cramped and not as nice as in the deluxe room. The seating area was nice, but overall, it just felt cramped. I really expected more for a suite, considering how much more it cost over a deluxe room. Despite that, the service was good overall. The valet were always helpful and friendly. The hotel is in a great location -- across the street from shopping, near the trolley station and walking distance to Seaport Village. My only other complaint is that when we were going to check out, my boyfriend call to have a luggage cart brought up. He called at 11 AM (check out is at noon). We waited for 20 minutes, and nobody came. We decided to stop waiting and took all of our luggage and pet down ourselves. It was a pain, and I was surprised we even waited at all, since everyone was usually so prompt and courteous. I don't know about the other rooms or suites, but if you have to choose between a deluxe room and a Legacy Suite, go with the deluxe room. You won't regret it! Additional Notes: 1. There is no swimming pool at this hotel. I believe patrons at this hotel can use the pool at the Westgate Hotel, which is right across the way. 2.

Well, they may be older than that but no one looks over the age of 25. Again, shocking for a 5 star hotel. Needless to say, they were very polite but lack the experience and polish expected by the clientele. The management, however, is all 5-star.

We love historic hotels, and we fully expected it to be to be great...but oh my gosh! I can't say enough about the service we received at every turn. Demi had helped my husband set up this surprise with flowers and strawberries in the room ahead of time, and she was ready and waiting for us when we checked in! After getting to our room (which was so lovely...see the pictures online) we realized there might be a noise issue from the neighbors. As my husband has a medical condition and really needs his sleep, we went back down to ask about possibly switching rooms. Raymond, who had checked us in, didn't hesitate a moment to not only switch it for us...but upgraded us to an even better room! Every concern was for us as the guest, and we felt so well taken care of. The next morning, he was quick to ask if it had worked out all right, and if my husband had slept well...knowing it was a factor of his condition. Breakfast at the Grant Grill was not only delicious, but Alberto our server was one of the most delightful we have ever had. So friendly, and since we arrived early and we were his only table, he spent extra time chatting with us and answering our many questions about the area, the hotel, and such. A fantastic start to the day. I don't want to leave anyone out, because all the staff was really over the top. Our valet Carlos helped us out several times with special requests, and even had bottled water waiting for us when we came back from walking down to the water. A great guy doing a great job. Anthony helped us when we switched rooms, and also very cheerfully spent time answering questions we had on more than one occasion. (Hint: He does tours of the hotel I found out, so I would definitely recommend asking for him!) Lee Ann at the concierge desk was very patient and happy to help when we grilled her for dinner reservations...which she set up for us as well. The quality of the hotel is excellent to begin with, but we wanted to recognize the caliber of their staff. We have never encountered such consistently excellent people who were so ready and happy to serve however it was needed. It was the best \"get away\" we have ever had because of them, and we actually met with the hotel manager to thank him in person. And by the way, he was great too! But we weren't surprised!

So as it was night time we came to turn on the jacuzzi and it was splashing everywhere wasnt pouring into the tub properly turns out its NOT FUNCTIONING properly!!!!! That was a huge disappointment since I did pay around 280 only for the jacuzzi. So I called them and they sent someone up then apologized and moved us to pent house-which actually wasnt nice at all:/ but my husband liked it so the jacuzzi was cool but IT WASNT working also the tools inside to keep water warm and lights werent working and the water kept gettin cold and draining out quick! then we just gave up telling them and went to sleep. Next morning they gave us complimentary bfast to make up for the chaos. Then we called to ask for a couple of hours in a functional jacuzzi as to make up for the past rooms. So they finally gave us a room 2 hours later and let us have 4 hrs in it, now this was the room i wanted in the first place!!!! Large spacious king bed, with FUNCTIONAL jacuzzi (but the lights weren't working but the warmer was so it worked) and we had the best time in those 4 hours if only we had that room to start with!

The photos looked wonderful and I thought it would be higher end luxury. I came for the Gran Fondo San Diego and had my bike shipped to the hotel. The hotel handled the package and even delivered to my room which was fantastic, thank you. The rooms are tiny. I'm talking S.F. room tiny. With my wife and a one year old, plus a crib, we were tripping over ourselves. The photos weren't exactly aligned with my expectations. The lobby is gorgeous, but the room and upper floors are older, with a touch of remodel. The biggest thing my wife and I were unaware of was the street noise. The sirens from police, ambulance, and fire is super loud. You can also hear people partying from the Gaslamp district. Drunk people yelling and laughing all throughout the night. If you're looking for a restful sleep, you'll have a hard time. Especially if your baby wakes up in the middle of the night. The rooms are very clean and the service is excellent. All the staff is very helpful, especially the bellhop and valet guy. I felt semi-rested for my 100-mile bike ride on Sunday, but would have preferred to been fresh from a good nights rest. Another thing about the location is the homeless. There are homeless people everywhere. Plus, they sleep right on the sidewalks in rows next to each other. Safety is a factor since I have my wife and child, so I would not recommend a romantic walk after 9pm. There are a lot of good restaurants within walking distance so you can walk or I'd prefer to take a cab if I didn't have a car. The hotel is central to everything, but maybe to central for us. I think next time, we'll look for a hotel 15 minutes outside of Downtown so it's more peaceful and less stressful. Business center is free if you have your own laptop. No free wi-fi is available in the room. I haven't understood that yet. Stay at a cheap hotel and it's free, but stay at a premium and you pay? Hmm. Also parking is valet and $30+ dollars a day. I think it's worth it considering there isn't much place to park in the congested Downtown area. Last thing, I was very excited to be able to take a bath with my 1 year old and take him swimming. Just a basic expectation without having read all the features and amenities. That was my fault. When I got there, I was disappointed on both counts. None of these features are available.

This is old world class right on the edge of the Gaslamp with very proper service and elegance dripping from every crystal on every chandelier. Yet somehow it's not stuffy. It's amazing how some places can pull that off. I only spent one night here, but managed to explore most of the hotel. For whatever reason, I was upgraded from a Deluxe room to a Signature Suite (they did seem to pay particular attention to Starwoods Preferred status) and now I'm ruined for all time. If I stay here again, I would pay to have the suite again. The decor is beautiful with the large swirl murals behind the bed, the plush furniture and the detail in the woodwork. The sig suites are basically a large room split in half between sleeping and living areas separated by a half-wall with arches over them. There's a dining table with its own mini-chandelier plus a conversation grouping of a desk, sofa, and armless easy chair. The bathroom is the crowning glory--a wonderful open space with long counter and two enormous porcelain bowl sinks. And then the shower--I would have been happy to pull a cot in there and have that be my room. It's about 36 square feet with an L-shaped bench and about six shower heads that will spritz you from several angles and levels. The Grant Grill has a very classic hotel bar feel, which is one of my favorite things. They also have a great happy hour daily from 4-8 when the small bites menu is half price and there are wine and beer specials. Fantastic. Service throughout was smooth and quite solicitous. Everyone was a pleasure to interact with. The only awkward thing about the place is that the valet entrance is on the back side of the lobby, meaning you enter all the way across from the hotel registration area. However, logistics kind of dictate this given that you wouldn't want to try to handle hotel traffic out front on busy Broadway. The trolley stops immediately behind the hotel on C street, so public transport is easy. It's a pleasant 10-minute stroll down to the Broadway Pier. The Westgate Hotel is directly next door, and despite the fact that it kind of looks like the apartment building on \"The Jeffersons\", it's been redone with ornate elegance inside. Tried the bar in there as well, which is smaller and a little stuffy-feeling for my taste.

We stayed for four days in early January and had two rooms (a deluxe and a connecting grand deluxe) on the 11th floor. First impressions were very positive, efficient and friendly valet and professional check-in. The rooms are beautifully and tastefully furnished (although they are small for the price) and the bed was probably the most comfortable I have ever experienced. My wife and I were celebrating a birthday and they kindly left a cake and a half bottle of wine in the room on our first day. Dinner in the Grant Grill was very good and the service was pleasant and professional. So far so good. Things only began to go downhill when we tried to sleep. The hotel is right in the heart of downtown with older windows. The noise was absolutely incredible (even on the 11th floor). I don't know if they have installed tertiary glazing on the lower floors but we were kept awake during each of the four nights we slept there with police sirens etc. This is largely outwith the control of the hotel, however, there was renovation work going on and the preparations began at around 6 each morning. We were woken with the sound of trucks and deliveries being made. If you are a light sleeper, please consider your options. Admittedly, we were not in the best frame of mind when going to breakfast after very little sleep but by any standard, the breakfast service was poor. Food was fine but we encountered condescending and unprofessional service which was totally in contrast to our positive dinner experience. Not a place to eat breakfast if you have any time pressure. The building is beautiful and is very centrally located but is unfortunately about two blocks out of the gaslamp which is well policed feels safe. Broadway and the area behind where the US Grant is situated is populated by many homeless people and although I fully accept that this is a part of modern life, it made the immediate vicinity of the hotel unpleasant in the evenings and were were accosted each evening when returning to the hotel. There is no doorman on the front entrance to Broadway and this would make a positive difference. Because of this environment, I would not stay here with small children and I would choose one of the hotels at the lower end of the gaslamp where this is less of a problem. I am an SPG member and the week after our stay, they sent me an e mail asking me to give feedback on our stay. I wrote a very detailed review which I sent to SPG around two months ago. I have received no feedback on this at all. The owners have invested a huge amount of capital in this historic building and it should be the reference for San Diego hotels, but until the service levels match the price of the rooms and the area around is cleaned up, I would definitely not stay here again.

The candy was both a potential choking hazard, as well as unsanitary as she could have easily eaten it. We saved one to speak with the front desk about it. Mark spoke with the front desk about it but she took the candy and threw it in the trash rather than keep it to show a manager and housekeeping. Although she apologized, she did not offer to have housekeeping inspect our room and provide any assistance other than to say she was sorry. Mark also advised that we did not receive our crib or refrigerator. I found this response below my expectations and asked to speak with a manager after we had breakfast. The manager on duty had housekeeping specially inspect our room and bring up the crib. Upon further discussion, she provided some courtesy starwood points. We never received the refrigerator despite ultimately 3 requests. Overall, we found the room and the hotel beautiful but the fact that candy was left on the floor from a prior guest after the room was presumably cleaned was very problematic for us since we have an 18 month old child. Our expectation was that the room would have been thoroughly cleaned.

The hotel is beautiful and in a great location, but our Landmark Suite is a poorly designed room with a view of a wall and trash outside the windows. The Starwoods website clearly says a Landmark Suite has a sofa and a club chair in a separate living room. Our living room is about 8'x12' and has no sofa -- and not enough space to fit a sofa or even a rollaway. There is only one chair in this \"suite.\" Because the hotel is older, each room is slightly different -- well, if they offer you Room 814, say no thanks. It is cramped and lacks enough space for a couple with a child (it is smaller than our friends' cheaper Legacy Suites). The front desk staff was nice when we asked for a more appropriate room, but unable to find us anything better even though we checked in early and didn't need the room right away. On our second day, I showed the manager a copy of the Starwoods' website and she eventually offered us a $75 daily credit (on a $360 room) after acknowledging that the room was incorrectly advertised. In my experience -- and I travel enough to be an active gold (and past platinum) Starwoods guest -- most other hotel managers would have comped at least one night upon seeing that a room was mislabeled. This isn't a situation where I subjectively consider the room small -- it is falsely advertised. Three other complaints -- there is no ice maker on the 8th floor, housekeeping hasn't made up our room yet (as of 4pm Saturday) and the hotel has not offered us any Starwood Gold benefits on any of the three rooms I booked.

The initial flow comes out of a hole in the wall, dumps onto the soap dish, and then into the tub. After you get the temperature set the flow can be diverted to the overhead shower nozzle, but the initial flow onto your head and body is COLD until the flow stabilizes. In addition, the European glass shower deflector ensures that a good portion of the shower water ends up on the floor. Not the most soothing bathing experience!

The staff was completely accommodating, friendly and gracious, without overdoing it. Our room? Omg, amazing. Loved the hallway, the lush carpet, the dim lighting and when we entered our room it was old school, yet interesting and sleek.

At night there was a hush of city noise, a few loud drunk folks outside,but mostly, our room felt like a special haven. the bar downstairs was simply lovely, with great wines and a really wonderful bartender. In the morning we ate the Grant Grille, which we were both assuming was being overly touted by the staff. No. It really was the best restaurant we could have chose and again, it was elegant and beautiful without feeling stuff or snooty. The location was perfect.

We did not get a chance to dine in the restaurant on the first floor as we met friends for meals in the Gaslamp district (which is just as well because the menu and price is uppity-up). The room was spacious and we had a great view of the Coronado bridge. My favorite and most important features of my stay are the bed, pillows and comforter! I slept soooo well and really enjoyed the high quality sheets and softness of the comforter. The only downside is the expensive parking ($35/night) which I gather **from complaining to the concierge** is a separate company handling the parking structure. Gah! All in all, I recommend this hotel, especially if you're just flying into San Diego and won't have to park a car. Also, when we were there admiring the lobby and taking pictures, we chanced upon a board advertising a future bridal event.

The hotel was within 10 minutes of the airport but we never heard planes landing or taking off. From the moment that I got out of the taxi and was greeted by the doorman to the time we left the service was topnotch! Check in was easy although the check in desk did look a bit more like the concierge desk rather than your usual check in counter. But this just added to the elegant living room feel of the lobby. Located right downtown we were within walking distance of the Gaslamp District and shopping as well as the waterfront. The front desk was most helpful with restaurant recommendations and sent us to a great French bakery-bistro for breakfast that has endless Mimosas on the weekend menu! Our standard room was quite roomy with a good sized bathroom with a walk-in shower and huge towels. While the room was located next to the elevator we never heard any elevator noises. We did hear some people out in the hallway but you can hear this in any hotel environment. We also ate in the Grill where the food and the service were some of the best I have had anywhere--- and I am a food and restaurant snob! One of the real hidden treats of this trip was the spa services. Manned by great staff from a spa down the street, you can have services in your room or in a very nicely appointed space within the hotel. The spa staff were very knowledgeable and did not try to sell any products to us -- which was a real pleasant change from some of the other spas I have used while traveling. Being located in a downtown area the hotel was also very aware of security and a key was required not only for your room but also for use of the elevator which helped my daughter and me to feel comfortable in the hotel proper. All in all we had a great ladies weekend and I would definitely book there again. And for those of you who look at the prices and may be scared away - do check out the specials on the hotel website.

SERIOUSLY?? - We did not receive the roll away until 9PM!!! After a couple calls and firm requests that we need this, they were finally able to track one down from another hotel.

The hotel is wonderfully maintained, having just celebrated its 100th year in service and having undergone a very costly, worthwhile renovation ($56m or so). Walking into the lobby for the first time, you will feel like you have been taken to another world with the plush carpets, overstated furniture and chandeliers. The staff is professional, never stuffy and very eager to help make your trip to SD an enjoyable one. The rooms are extremely comfortable -- especially the robes. The hotel itself is located across the street from Horton's Plaza (main shopping plaza) and right on the perimeter of the Gaslamp District. The Gaslamp is the center of SD's thriving entertainment scene with restaurants, bars and clubs -- it has something for everyone. The US Grant is perfectly situated. Please be aware, unfortunately SD has a lot of homeless beggars around the hotel, so you do need to be aware of your surroundings....that is not to say the area is unsafe, but you will see a number of homeless people no matter where you stay.

The faucet of the shower was falling off too, no biggie but same thing, how can that happen, they need their housekeepers to report that type of problem. Some dust in the corners too...maybe that room doesn't get used that often.

I have seen several comments about room size - I believe I was given a standard room, and I felt it was plenty spacious. The room had a small entry way, very nice sized bedroom, and modern bathroom. The bathroom did not have a tub, but had an oversized shower which was very nice. Nice furnishings with club chair and desk, free wireless internet, nice English toiletries, and complementary bottles of water were provided in the room. I stayed on the 6th floor. My only complaints were that 1) there was a considerable amount of street noise, including bar patrons, and sirens; and 2) The only close parking option with in and out privleges was the hotel's valet, and the price was $32.

When I reserved the room online, I made a special request to check in early and I let them know it was our 25th anniversary. I reserved a Legacy Suite (which is a smaller suite). I called the morning of our stay, and they said they'd call me if a room opened up early. Around 11:30am, they called and said our room was ready. When we checked in they told me our room was one of their signature suites, which I thought meant a suite unique to their hotel. Well, when we got to the room, it was HUGE. It had a dining area, a living room area, two king size beds and a bathroom as big as a bedroom in our home, with a walk-in, mult-sprayer shower. Wow! What an upgrade. In the afternoon, there was a knock at our door with a hotel employee delivering four huge, chocolate covered strawberries as a complimentary, anniversary gift. In addition, the location was great. Once we parked our car, we didn't use it again until we left the next day. We had lunch in a very nearby Brazilian Barbeque restaurant that was great, and later that evening, we met some friends in a nearby jazz club to have drinks, appetizers and dessert while listening to music. The stay in the room was very relaxing, romantic and comforable. The staff, on every level, was very pleasant and helpful. We had a great time! One other thing; I took advantage of a government employee discount when I made my initial reservation and we received all the above (upgrade and all) for that discounted rate on the smaller suite I had reserved.

The shower was a little bit weak though, hard to get wet but I think thats just because the building is older and we were on the 11th floor. The actual bedroom was a little smaller because of the large bathroom, if you dont need a tub then you may prefer to select a larger room with a sitting area. There is a mini bar but its automated and if you move anything it creates a charge, so no way could we put our own drinks or water in there. The happy hour is great with lots of half price cocktails, the appetizers are 50% off too so we had the fruit plate every afternoon and it was always different with plenty to eat. Didnt like the calamari, little too chewy. All the staff are very friendly and helpful, could not fault the service.

Let me first say that a 5 star rating implies high end service, amenities and attention to detail. The US Grant in downtown San Diego is touted as a 5 star hotel but failed to meet any hint of such quality. I will detail our observations from our 3 night stay. Some may see these criticisms as petty, but in a 5 star hotel, these details would NOT be overlooked. Although of no real bearing on the hotel's quality, the immediate neighborhood was quite crowded with homeless individuals. I mention this because atmosphere usually an impact on ones enjoyment of their chosen accommodations and have nothing against the unfortunate people who have no place to go. When checking in to a hotel, a major first impression is given by the professionalism of the front desk staff. The ill fitting, cheap looking suits should have been our first warning. Along the way to our 5th floor room we noticed dust and dirt in the corners of every hall and outside the service elevator. It made us feel as though we'd just entered a flophouse. Throughout our stay midday and into the evening, the heavy room doors in our hall were slamming shut over and over again. Some of this happened when guests came and went but the majority was at the hands of housekeeping who should know better. In the room (check-in day and the following two nights) we found several unfortunate things: On two separate nights there was a cleaning rag left on the floor by the bed, one night a sponge was left in the bathroom and the cover to the tissue was left on the bathroom counter. One lamp was left unplugged, lamp shades facing the wrong direction and crooked, and only one bathrobe in the closet. The crooked lampshade was never noticed by housekeeping as we left it just to see what kind of attention they paid such details. The bathroom sink water pressure was a mere dribble and the amenities were not fully replaced each night as one would expect. The bathroom mirrors looked as though they were washed by a blind person with smears and spots left behind. On our second night we arrived back at the hotel at 3:30 and the room had not yet been made up. Our last night there the bed looked as though there was someone sleeping it it because the comforter (with a ripped cover) had been laid out as though it were thrown on the bed. Our first morning we came to find a scratch in our rental car which was adequately handled by management, but you would think that at $32.00 per day for parking, some sort of compensation would have been offered. Nope. The $42.00 bottle of wine in the room was sad to see whereas in the Joie de Vivre hotels such a thing is complimentary. We tried the hotel bar and paid more for one (small) glass of wine than what the hotel paid for the entire bottle. In that bar, on a very slow night, our table was filthy with fingerprints and rings from previous drinkers beverages. And of course a massive glaring flat screen TV over the bar all but obliterated any sense of escape and luxury we had hoped for. Even the staff maligned the installation of this thing. Overall this was a HUGE disappointment based on the Hotels history and promise of 5 star service. We would have to say that the one GOOD thing about the US Grant hotel was the Valet Staff.

Original reservations were to the Westin across the street (owned by same company) and had to pay full price as we were unable to get in on the reservations through Comic-Con as they were sold out. Got a call a day or two before we were scheduled to head down and advised that our hotel had been \"upgraded\" to the US Grant. Cool, or so I thought.... Overnight parking is $32 bucks on top of the $469 we paid for a room. Oh, despite being upgraded with the same amenities as the Westin (two beds), my confirmation read one. I called and was put on hold for 45 minutes before I called on my girlfriend's phone and advised I was still on hold. Eventually it was sorted out. One thing I will say was cool is we could park the Truck before we checked in and after we checked out at no cost. The parking cost only applies if the vehicle is kept overnight. Upon arriving and checking in, the lobby is very nice. The elevators are pretty small and designed to encourage you to bell-hop your bags. Once we got out of the elevator, the first thing we noticed was the floors. I don't know if it was the lighting, which was very dim, but the floors looked like they had been flooded or had serious water damage. If this is their aesthetic flare, then I would say it didn't work for me. We were in Room 733. As we got to our room around 8:00, there was a dinner tray with some left over food to the room next to us, likely 735. It looked fresh so we paid no attention. Inside the room was pretty small, especially for the price. Motel 6 could have probably been bigger. One of the bathroom lights didn't work and one of the main room lights didn't work. However, even with the lights, I believe the rooms are too dimly lit (personal preference). The double beds we got were ridiculously small. I am 6'3 and I was not very comfortable when I tried to sleep that night. One plus is the shower heads. Because of my height, a lot of showers are positioned way too low and I have to hunch over to take a shower. This shower head was above my head and I like that. Upon waking up, we needed to know if the hotel would allow us to keep the truck while we went to Comic-con. There are 2 phones in the room. We tried the phone next to the bed. To use the phone, you keep the phone on the receiver, punch the line you want and then push the department you want. All calls failed to go through, which was aggravating. I then used the phone on the desk and all I had to do was push the service line. 2 attempts both went to voice-mail. Finally called the front desk on my personal phone and got our question answered and also requested bell-hop to come and hold our bags while we went to Comic-Con. On our way out at about 8:30 in the morning, the plate of food was still in the hall and was dried up and giving off an odor... I went to check-out at that time and was told I had a $470 balance due on the room. This was quite a shock since I had already been charged and paid in advance. They then indicated that they credited my original CC a day earlier and needed payment. I tried with my original card but it failed. Luckily I had my back-up card. This upset me because my original card I wanted to pay with because I wanted the points on that card. The card I ended up paying with does not collect points. Second, it is now 5 days since the card was supposedly credited and I have not been credited the funds on that card, so I am closely watching that matter. So we go to Comic-Con and come back to pick-up the truck and are told to go back to the front desk because there was an issue. Turns out to be the card issue again for the $32 overnight parking fee. They couldn't have notified me at the time I paid the room fee that I had an outstanding vehicle fee?? Needless to say, it was a nice Comic-Con, but the sleeping arrangements and the hotel was lacking. Really a 4 Star/4 Diamond?

This was an interesting contrast to this luxury collection property. The hotels biggest fault is its inability to block out hallway noise. Most nights of sleep were interrupted by loud guests walking down the halls late at night as well as early in the morning. It seems that renovations may have left a large opening under the door that allows for significant sound to enter the room. Additionally, the door essentially opens up in to the sleeping area which does not buffer the noise.

Not exactly a pleasant aroma while you're trying to get clean. Also, I felt our room was less than clean. This could be because of the icky feeling that was left by the errant cleaning glove left behind in our room. Uhhh, housecleaning, I think you forgot something. We found it rather amusing that after we set out the empty glasses that they failed to remove earlier with the glove inside, only the glasses remained. I guess they didn't want management to know that the glove was left behind in the room but didn't want to bother themselves with taking the glasses? They also threw out our newspaper (that we brought with us) that we hadn't even had a chance to read yet. Why would they leave behind dirty glasses but throw out your paper? When we notified the front desk, they said they'd look for another one but called us back and told us they were plum out of papers. Basically, the front desk wasn't really going to go out of their way for anything. Like others have mentioned, parking is atrociously expensive. You're not going to get anything free, not even complimentary coffee. I also didn't like that you couldn't use your refrigerator because if you moved anything inside you'd automatically be charged for it. We normally bring water and some snacks with us to the hotel but were a little annoyed to find our refrigerator inaccessible. Yes, it is loud. I normally sleep right through the night without interruption but I woke up several times to the sounds of people in the streets and ahem...in their rooms. At one point I asked my boyfriend if there was an earthquake because of the people in the next room \"enjoying themselves\" at 4 in the morning. There's also no pool but you can use the Westin's across the street. Another thing that irked me...there was no bathtub. Only a shower. Overall, this hotel LOOKS like a five-star hotel but the service and the amenities just weren't there for me.", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anchorage, Alaska", "Title": "\u201cValet parking for bicycles\u201d", "Author": "Joewaterford", "ReviewID": "UR69554373", "Content": "After reading the reviews about the U.S. Grant (\"USG\") on Trip Advisor, I can't understand what the complaints were about. From the time we arrived until we left, the staff and Hotel are above and beyond anything I have ever experienced before. I'm not a world traveler, (my girlfriend is though) and I don't make a ton of money, but the USG was the absolute best hotel I have ever stayed in. The two things that really stood out for us were the room cleaning service people and the valet parking. When my girlfriend and I arrived, she had a terrible migraine and was throwing up. When the room service people found out how sick she was, they brought her chicken noodle soup and chamomile tea---free of charge. The best part for me though was the valet parking. I rented a bicycle, and I asked the concierge where I could lock up my bike. He replied just take it to the valet parking, and they would put it in a secure storage area. At the end of the first day of riding, I ride into the parking garage and ask them if they could store my bike, \"Yes sir not a problem, let me get your name and give you this ticket, and when you're ready to get your bike just call down and we'll have it ready for you\"---Whoaa---how cool is this? The next morning I'm ready to go and I call down to tell them I'll be down in five and please bring my bike out. Again, how cool is it to walk through a door and have a guy (or girl) holding your bike and asking \"How was your ride yesterday Mr Mathis\"? I felt like Lance Armstrong. Another reviewer complained about no bathub in the bathroom---are you kidding me???? I'm guessing that person is in the minority. Who would want a tub in the bathroom when your on vacation or a business trip. I loved the large (room for two) shower stall and no tub to climb over and the huge glass doors were awesome. I wish there was a bit more water pressure, but the shower head was one of those large rain shower type and got the job done. We were on the 4th floor, and the hot water came up fast. We had a corner room on Broadway and 3rd, and while there was noise form the street below, it never really bothered me, and I was never awakened by sirens or traffic going by. The windows are single pane, but they do add to the charm of the hotel. The beds were extremely comfortable for a hotel, nice and firm. The refrigerator was well stocked, and we didn't see the notice about taking stuff out and being charged for it. We rearranged it so we could put in our own soft drinks and milk. A few days later we realised that we would be charged for taking the items out of the fridge even though we didn't drink them. When we explained to the front desk what we did they pulled up our bill and immediately took them off--no charge, no problem. And we learned we could ask for a separate refrigerator for our own use free of charge. I was concerned about all the street people around the hotel, but after a couple days I realized they weren't a problem. When they asked for money, I kept going and for the most part they didn't bother me. One evening we took our leftovers to a homeless man we'd noticed earlier in the day, and he was very appreciative. Like another reviewer wrote, I felt completely safe walking around that area after dark, and had no problem walking from Petco field after a ballgame. (stinkin' Colorado Rockies won). All the hotels in the gaslamp district had street people hanging around, but not in front of the hotels bothering people. San Diego is a phenominal city. I have been describing it to my friends as compact and easy to get around in. Everything is with in walking distance. The USG is an awesome hotel, with an exceptional staff and I hope to get the chance to stay there again. The valet parking for my bicycle was just the best. Thank you U. S.

The port is a 5 minute taxi ride away but be advised that the taxi will drop you a little ways (~ 50 yards) from the port entrance because of the traffic volume.

The further in from the Bay you travel, the worse the neighborhood becomes and while this place may look fancy, the neighborhood is far from it. So the hotel is 100 years old. The AC is really loud, the furnishings are so so and the fitness center is located in the BASEMENT and is nothing more than a few exercise bikes and a treadmill (far less than what is offered at the above 2 hotels) . There is absolutely no view from the hotel room. Lets just say, if I was 70 years old I might find this hotel nice. It is the complete opposite of a modern hotel such as the OMNI.

I chose the hotel based upon the reviews of the property and the proximity to Gas Lamp Square. Similar to a couple of other posters we checked into the hotel (room 804) and were disappointed. The room in and of itself was appointed well and comfortable but was much smaller than we expected. Generally we roll with the flow but as we don't get away too often I thought I should at least mention our disappointment to the front desk. Much to my delight they made an immediate adjustment upon our request and placed us in a truly remarkable room (802). Again, the room was appointed well and very comfortable but was also quite large. In addition to our room, the ambiance of the hotel speaks for itself. From the lobby, to the restaurant and bar, it is absolutely beautiful. The restaurant was very good, the bar enjoyable, and the art gallery off the lobby was a nice touch and a fascinating diversion. While all of these aspects of the hotel contributed to our opinion of the hotel, what really sets them apart is the service. I travel fairly frequently and have had the good fortune to have stayed in many well thought of and highly respected hotels. That being said, the service at the US Grant was far and away the best I have ever encountered. There wasn't one incident where someone didn't excel at their job. We were there for just about a day and I had several members of the staff greet me by name. I still haven't quite figured out how they do that. The front desk staff, the concierge, the bellmen, the wait staff, and the bartenders were all incredible. Truly some of the nicest people I have ever met. The US Grant is a good hotel because of the ambiance, it is a phenomenal hotel becasue of the staff. Now, be aware, it is not a budget property. The foor and drinks are expensive. There is not a pool although you can use the Westin which is a very short walk. The gym is very small and would be a disppointment to anyone looking for a quality workout. I might suggest the management look at forging a relationship with the 24 Hour Fitness that is a short walk form the hotel. Other than that, we were quite pleased and are looking forward to visiting San Diego and the US Grant again in the near future.", "Date": "March 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cDisapointed\u201d", "Author": "MreddyCalifornia", "ReviewID": "UR57822851", "Content": "Hotel staff is very friendly & helpful , room is clean , bed is very comfortable & the decor of the room is exceptional .

Upon arriving, we were assigned Room #603, which is undoubtedly the worst in the building....it's very narrow, looks out onto a row of windows from another wing of the hotel (a la \"Rear Window\"), is located next to the elevators and, most importantly, features a single full-size bed. According to the website, this room doesn't even exist in the hotel....it claims that all of the Superior rooms have either king or (2) double beds. And yet, I still love this place enough to give it four stars. Why? Service. Every employee in this building is friendly and eager to please....they'll do anything to make your stay enjoyable. When I called down to complain about the room we were assigned, the front desk apologized profusely and explained that we'd literally booked the last room for the night (which was probably true, we hadn't booked until 11pm the night before), and that they'd gladly move our luggage into a new room while we were out on the town the next day. Our new room was much larger, had an honest-to-goodness (and exceedingly comfortable) king bed, a lovely view of the city, and was located on the 10th floor, opposite the Presidential Suite. Truth is, though, even our original room was something to behold (tiny bed aside). It was like a tiny luxury apartment from a bygone era....beautiful wall etchings, original art, period-style carpet and a minibar finished in leather. The bathroom had a design-first, functionality-second basin sink and an oversized shower....no tub, which is expected in a hotel of this vintage. Every room in the building has at least one 32\" LCD, and in our second room the TV was connected to a Bose sound system with subwoofer (!). The rooms are full of tiny little touches that you don't see in higher-end chain hotels; the closets have little wall-mounted valets stocked with umbrellas, shoe horns and brushes....all of the lights in the room are on dimmers, so you can control the mood....the toilet has a soft-close lid....etc. Not everything's perfect, of course....the period-style curtains do little to block out morning light, and the walls and windows aren't as thick as they should be (to be expected, given the hotel's vintage). And the fitness room leaves a lot to be desired...it's small, inconveniently located down a long hallway in the basement and, at least when we visited, had several machines that were out of order. Unacceptable in a Luxury Collection hotel, IMO. Overall, though, this is a great place to relax and be pampered...even if I'd probably be a little more harsh if I hadn't paid only $149 for our room. We'll be back, I'm sure. P.S. - You can avoid getting the bargain-basement room by asking for another room if the one you're assigned ends in \"03\" or \"04\" and is located on the 7th floor or lower. \"03\" and \"04\" rooms above the 7th floor are much larger and have actual city views. :)", "Date": "February 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cClass and style with excellent service make for a wonderful relaxing weekend.\u201d", "Author": "Brigitte_from_CA", "ReviewID": "UR56285777", "Content": "We really enjoyed our 3-day stay in this beautiful hotel.

(Actually, I paid a lot more at a hotel in Washington, DC at the beginning of this trip.) We did have a problem with our billing. We had prepaid for the stay, but for some reason they didn't have our payment in their system and they put a hold on our credit card for the cost of the whole stay, no small amount considering we were there for a week. It was supposed to have been fixed on the first day, but we found out the hard way that it wasn't when our card was declined at a restaurant. I thought that was a pretty big thing to mess up on. My only other complaint was the charge for WIFI in the rooms. I know that a lot of hotels charge, but it's really a pet peeve for me. By the way, it is free in the lobby. The hotel is a historic property, so the windows don't block out all the street noise. If you are overly sensitive to the noise, just ask for a quiet room-some overlook an inner courtyard, so you won't hear anything. The rooms are also not all the same size, as far as I could tell, but I think we got pretty luck in that regard. Overall I was very pleased with the hotel and would definitely return.

We are Starwood members and booked in advance for a deluxe room for our Wedding Anniversary. I am very un-happy and rather troubled by the way things turned out especially since we are Starwood members, it was our Anniversary and we were return guests ! Upon pulling up to the valet the guys took a few minutes to even acknowledge we were there (that's never happened before) but once they acknowledged us they were nice and courteous as always. Check-in with Sergio went well and he even noted or Starwood member number and told us Happy Anniversary so I figure we'd get upgraded for sure. Then our Bellman Anthony came over and he was very nice, he took us up to our room (910) and upon entering I was a little disappointed as it was not upgraded and did not even have the full length standing mirror that deluxe rooms have, and to be quite honest the other Superior rooms we've stayed in here were better and even had more windows. Then while the bellman was bringing in our luggage he told us our room was actually joined with the Presidential Suite and that's when I heard all the noise actually coming from the other room (originally when I walked in, I thought the noise was from the \"dream machine\" that was playing) but I figured it was just a tour of the Presidential suite being given and I didn't think about it because that room is $3,500 a night and didn't think anyone would be staying there (so wrong). So when our bellman left he ask what time we'd like our turn down service, I said 8:30pm and would also like our champagne to be put on ice, he wrote it down on a piece of paper and said no problem. After he left I could still hear the people in the Pres. Suite talking and then all of a sudden the joining door was swinging back and forth and I went up to it and started talking to the other guy through the door and he said they were staying in there that night and we should call up security to have them come lock the deadbolt, so I called them up and they locked that door and said 'sorry'. At about 5:30pm my Husband decided to go look around the Horton Plaza while I take a shower and get ready for our night out and when I got out of the shower I noticed that housekeeping had been in our room while I was in the shower !!! They attempted to do a turndown service but instead of leaving when hearing the shower running they just did a BAD and quick job at turndown; no slippers out, no robes, no ice for the champagne and my high heels that were set out were trampled into the hallway. I couldn't believe they entered while I was in the shower after I asked for turndown at 8:30, not to mention the bathroom door didn't even lock and I had my purse out on the bed and my jewelery on the bed too ! After we went out and came back to the hotel I noticed that they still didn't come back to finish the room, they left it with a crappy turndown, but I still forgave it and continued on with the night. That is until 12:30am.... that's when the party in the joining Presidential Suite started, it was awful, I can't even explain how bad it was, yelling, cussing, annoying woman cackling, loud rap music, it was like we were in the room partying with them, it was SO loud ! We let it go on a little bit in hopes they would stop but at 1:30am my Husband went to the lobby and he was told \"there are no more king beds, but we will send up security\", I was pissed because I couldn't believe they just said they had no more king beds, I didn't care what kind of bed it was I just wanted to enjoy my Anniversary night in peace! So by 2:30am the party is still going strong and my head is throbbing with a migraine and I'm in tears because this experience was ruined, our romantic night together turned into a keg party we weren't even invited to, so my Husband called down to the lobby again and they said they would send up some keys for a new room but that we \"could only sleep in there\"... WHAT !?!?! We weren't allowed to shower and get ready we would have to come back to our original room to get ready, I have never heard of that before ! even a motel 6 wouldn't have done that. So I was not about to be okay with that, I just couldn't believe it. So about 10 mins later a guy brought up the new room keys and my Husband asked him again \"so we can only sleep in there\" and he said \"yes\" and that's when I lost it, I was crying and saying it was unacceptable and no other hotel would do this and then the guy said \"on behalf of the hotel we would like to apologize and offer you a comp breakfast from the Grant Grill\". We didn't end up changing rooms because that was ridiculous, what woman is going to want to change floors and rooms at 3am and then again at 7am to get ready !?!? So we just waited for the party next door to end, and at about 4am we were finally able to sleep. The breakfast in the morning was great but hardly worth the trouble, the tears and our Anniversary night to be ruined. I am so disappointed that our favorite hotel, the US Grant did this to us. I don't know if I can ever come back. How could they book a Starwood couple spending a romantic Anniversary night next to a loud party in the joining room !?!?!?

The hospitality was unparalleled; the staff knowledgeable and unassuming, with a friendliness that we found engaging and genuine. The location of was a perfect one block distance from the gaslamp district, just far enough away from the Friday night noise and bustle (think Times Square, or French Quarter). True, I am 46 and my days of mosh pits and head-banging have transitioned to twilight al fresco dinners and people watching. If any of this is resonating with you, then trust me when I say the Grant was a fine respite from the gaslamp\u2019s excitement. Our two-day stay in San Diego was our first foray into California vacationing, and coming off a five-day cruise to Mexico, we thought a few days in San Diego would be a great way to wind down, prior to making the flight back to New Jersey. Don't know what we were thinking. The food was as delightful as the weather, and with so much to do and see, returning to the Grant after a long day of shopping and sightseeing felt like coming home to my own personal castle; my room spotless, my bed turned down and adorned with chocolates, beckoning me to crawl into the lush array of down pillows on a bed that any millionaire would envy. We booked through hotels.com back in June, and don\u2019t know how, but somehow I scored a room for $110 / night. I had forgotten the rate I had secured, and was shocked when I received the final bill. I could get picky about the size of the room, or the location, or the view, but anyone who has traveled in Europe would have paid 4 times this amount for a comparable room in Paris. I travel frequently for business, and will often opt for a cheaper hotel to save the company a few bucks. There is no sacrifice here. If you want to spend a few more dollars, book a bigger room, with a nicer view, and hop into bed. But definitely stay in this hotel. A few folks have complained about the homeless. Yeah, homeless folks are a downer, especially juxtaposed against such a classic hotel when you\u2019re on vacation, but you can't beat up the hotel. If I was homeless, you wouldn't find me in New Jersey, I can assure you. Offer them that pizza you know you're not going to eat anyway, and count your blessings. A special note of thanks to concierge Lee Ann Kinkelaar, who made our stay extra-special. Whether referring us to the best seafood restaurant or hamburger joint, to charging an ipod or giving us a history lesson, Lee Ann exemplified the spirit of the US Grant; elegant, yet approachable, appropriate, genuine, and accommodating.

I also called the spa concierge few days before our arrival to try to set up a massage for my wife and they never called me back... it was the day before Thanksgiving.

The hotel is luxurious and the staff are very friendly and helpful. You can find hints of it's age, but the recent renovations definitely help. Our \"superior\" room was on the smaller side but the bathroom is nice and large. The room has very luxurious decorations without being gaudy. The shower, my favorite part, can probably fit 3 people. No bathtub though. The windows are a bit thin and the noise of the gaslamp late-night crowds and police/fire sirens are quite loud. Especially on the east side, and we were 7 stories up. It's in a great location, on the north end of the gaslamp district and right across from a decent mall. It's a few blocks from a 24 hour Ralphs.

It is true that they don't have a pool, but guests have access to the pool at their sister hotel across the street. The U.S. Grant did not feel like a five star hotel, though, because they were missing a lot of the details. These are just a couple of examples. When we arrived, we drove around the block twice, pausing by each entrance to look for the door men and valets, which are hidden in this tiny alley that is badly marked. I called the front desk of the hotel for help, and they acted like it was impossible to miss but then gave me bad directions. We cannot be the first people to have this problem, so it seems like they could be more helpful. Our room had only one robe, so I called housekeeping, only to receive their voicemail. I left a message, but they did not come by with the other robe until we called back later that night. They cleaned the room each day but did not replace any of the bath products we used (shampoo, cotton swabs, etc. for our entire stay). None of these things are a big deal, but you just do not expect issues like this in a five star hotel. We ate at the Grant Grill for dinner and found it good but over-priced. The bread was particularly tasty, but $24 for a small plate of vegetables (the only vegetarian entree) just doesn't pass the red face test.

This hotel is directly across the street from Horton Plaza (se pictures) and within easy walking distance to the Civic Center, 4th and B, the Gaslamp and Petco Park. It\u2019s a short cab to Balboa Park or Hillcrest. You can't get more central. Yes, there are \"homeless people\" but it's a city center and you will encounter all types here. It is in NO WAY a bad or improvised part of the city. We had room service which was excellent and was setup beautifully. The rooms were nicely arranged and the bed was great with lots of down pillows. The lobby is very grand with beautiful furniture and chandeliers. CONS: I can't comment on the room rate because I used my starwood points for a free stay. However, the parking was a bit pricy ($32/night). I guess we could have parked else where and walked to the hotel but that seemed like a hassle. I suppose its not too bad, but was more than we expected. If you want a room with a view of the city then there will be a bit of street noise. It did not effect our sleep or relaxation at all, but it is something to note.

Room 524 is one of my favorites, although it isn't a suite it is set perfectly with windows all around the room. The rooms are clean, comfy, and gorgeous! My only con is the pricey valet, I think it was $32 or $34/night, but I think there is a parking lot that is half the price down the street and there is no free internet in the rooms, but they do have free wifi available in the lobby area. The gym is good enough, they have weights, couples treadmills and some eliptical machines and provide water bottles and fruit for free.

Very beautiful and stately hotel with historical accents, as well as a central location. Wife and I also loved the theme colors (dark wood and blue). Lobby was magnificent and service was above average (as I only had to deal with the front desk). We are Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) members and upon reservation I indicated that the stay is for our five year wedding anniversary. Upon check-in, we were upgraded right away to the suite on one of the top floors, so the noise issue from below was not a factor. So make sure you let them know what you are celebrating and it also helps to become members of SPG (free). The suite was beautifully decorated and well appointed. Two LCD TVs (a 50\" LG for the living room and a 32\" LG for the bedroom - more on this later), dark wood desk area and furnishings, marble floors on the bathroom (sadly though, no bathtub), Gilchrist & Soames toiletries, a plush love seat, and of course the centerpiece of it all - the King sized Heavenly Bed with lots of pillows. Although we ourselves have a Queen sized Heavenly Bed at home, the King was a nice treat. About the TVs. I am a videophile that appreciates the latest electronics, so it excited me to see that the suite had not one but two HDTVs. What utterly dumbfounded me was when I discovered that both TVs only show standard-definition TV programming! Unacceptable. So needless to say picture quality was terrible. What an absolute waste of technology. The one saving grace was that the Bose DVD player was available and was connected via component cables so our DVD movies at least looked great. Another tech letdown was that although this place markets itself as a 5 star hotel, it befuddles me that they charge $13 per day for Internet access in the rooms. It should be included (or, at the very least, it should be complimentary to SPG members). While Internet access is free down at the lobby, who wants to schlep down there in their pj's to check email? Two money saving tips: do not, under any circumstances, move anything out of the mini-bar. These latest versions have a sensor that automatically detects (and charges) you for anything you remove that you don't replace within, count 'em, 60 seconds. We wanted to put a couple of bottled waters in there that we brought from home as well as to chill some chocolate covered strawberries but unfortunately we weren't able to do that. Regarding parking, if you don't want to fork over $32 for the valet parking you can drive around the neighborhood to find some street parking. We found paid parking just north of the hotel on Fourth Avenue. The lot charges $8 and there are no restrictions for overnight parking. I added $10 to the slot just in case and we were OK the next day. As for the location, the hotel is centrally located. We caught a movie right across the street at the uniquely laid out Horton Plaza and had dinner a few blocks down at the Oceanaire Seafood Room. Gaslamp is very lively in the evenings and it was fun to hang out in the area and not have to drive anywhere. Final thing: I hope that the hotel management consider green improvements to help the environment. They can easily replace the incandescent bulbs in the rooms for example with CFLs as a first step.

She was a tremendous help and answered all my questions so I knew our stay would be great. We previously spent one night at the Sheraton Marina and departed early for downtown. We arrived around 9am and did a pre-registration for our Signature Suite room (326) before spending a long & full day at Sea World. We were pleased the hotel would store our bags until our evening return. We then met Mark at the concierge desk. Mark was so pleasant and friendly and such a joy to ask for assistance. I had done quiet a bit of research on the trolley and bus systems and new we could take both to Sea World. However, when we had stored our bags I had also left all my research and schedules in them. Mark was quick to produce the schedules we needed along with detailed information for getting around. We head out to the back side of the hotel to await the trolly to Old Town. After a half hour of waiting someone had called and found the system had lost power and was backed up. . .\"back\" to the hotel we wend and Mark provided a bus schedule. The bus picked up in \"front\" of the US Grant after only a 5 min wait and off we went for our day at Sea World. About 8pm we had caught the trolley back and with two very tired 6 yr olds, sore feet, & in need of a good nights rest we finally went to our beautiful room. Waiting for us was a wonderful welcoming gift of chocolate covered banana's and a bottle of wine. Again, I was living my dream & the wine was the perfect end to our long LONG day at Sea World. We showered our boys in the HUGE 10X10 ft shower. . .Yes ten by ten feet, 6-jet/headed shower and tucked them into a huge king bed. Exhausted ourselves my husband & I headed for our king bed after our short glass of wine. We slept very soundly in very comfortable beds. . .after having stayed at the Westin Villas in Maui, we knew there were indeed hotels with heavenly beds and bedding. . .the US Grant did no fail us. The array of feather pillows and soft clean bedding was perfect. In the room we were also provided with robes, slippers, coffee/tea, bottled water, & turn-down service with chocolates. The Signature Suite is made up of an entry way, two large King beds, 2 large screen TVs, a desk/office station ($11.95 per day internet charge), a huge bathroom with double sinks and living-room & dining-room. On the downside there is a fridge filled with mini-bar items but no room for your own items. The next morning was the 4th of July and I had first planned on taking the family to the Le Cake Chateau (up the street about 3 blocks), we arrived only to find it closed and walked back to the Grant. The Horton Plaza across the street didn't have much open but we were able to make a breakfast out of Starbucks items (the kids seemed happy). We spent the day at the USS Midway, road the ferry to Coronado Island, recommended by the front desk, (had lunch at Spiro's Gyros) and road the ferry back. . .being the 4th of July everything was busy and they were running an extra ferry to accommodate the extra traffic (but they were still full and standing room only). Then back to the US Grant for a rest (too many people and too much walking around between this morning and Sea World the day before). About 5pm we decided to catch the #7 bus to Balboa park only to find all the Museums were closed due to the 4th but also because of this the park was fairly quiet with little amount of people. We enjoyed the beautiful buildings and came upon the Moreton Bay Fig tree and took a few sets of stairs down to a quiet little forest area that seemed right out of a book. Our boys enjoyed playing with the squirrels running around. About 7pm we'd had enjoy walking and tried to catch the bus back to our hotel. . it never showed up. . we began walking and crossed the freeway stopping a Mc Donalds, then finally saw 2 or 3 buses go by (either they had been stuck in traffic or broken down for 30 min). Near Mc Donalds we found the trolley and happily boarded for the short ride to the US Grant. Again exhausted we were too tired to head out to watch the fireworks and instead enjoyed the Bose sound system with both large flat-screen TV showing the fireworks on local news channels. After the display our boys fell asleep. I wasn't exactly hungry but wanted to order room service from the Grant Grill and we decided to get the cheese tray (for 1 @$18 - you can order for 1 or 2). We still had some red wine left over and I figured cheese would be tasty. Room service took awhile and the total bill came to $27 for 6 pieces of cheese. One might find this disappointing but it was more for the fun of it and to try something different. The presentation was lovely and along with the cheese were some gourmet bread & crackers, thinly sliced meats, mixed berries and the best honey we've ever tasty. Since it was an order for 1 I hadn't expected much but the extra $10 in charges were a bit excessive for room service and taxes. The experience was fun and the dish was brought in on a silver tray. Along with the wine we made a picnic out of it in front of the living-room tv. This was a great end to our last evening. You can see from my photos we did not have much of a view but the lack of street noise more then made up for it. . .we didn't hear a thing our entire stay. Though this hotel is recommended more for adults our two small boys LOVED it, loved the shower, loved the beds and watching cartoons in the room. Though we didn't use it we found we could have gain access to the Westin's swimming pool if we had so wanted. We took a long relaxing morning and headed for the airport. I missed the opportunity to meet Demi in person but she along with the concierge, Mark, made our stay perfect. I look forward to returning in the future (maybe without the kids).", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ashland, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cNice Stay\u201d", "Author": "lilroy0", "ReviewID": "UR33815570", "Content": "I stayed at the US Grant on a business trip while in San Diego for a conference and was pleased with the stay.

The hotel is absolutely gorgeous and the rooms are nicely appointed, but again the rooms are somewhat on the small side.

We were then going to depart on a cruise. Here is a brief breakdown of my impression of my stay and a couple of tips: First, the positives: The lobby was beautiful, impressive and comfortable to hang out in. The staff who checked us in were welcoming and professional. The room we stayed in was small, but exceedingly well decorated and clean (see pictures) and the bathroom, though small, was mostly marble and so well-appointed that you I could almost forgive the lack of space. The bed was amazingly comfortable. My husband and I rarely find a bed that we both can sleep well on, and this was one of them. There were actually free bottles of water in the room (something of an oddity anymore in city hotels) and turndown service. The hotel's location was also close to a lot of restaurants and shops. If you're a mall fan, Horton Plaza is right across the street. The not-so-positives: For some reason the hallways on our floor did not appear to be vacuumed for the entire length of our stay. There were some pretty large pieces of debris that were on the floor that were visible (and were joined by other debris) during the course of our stay. The lobby was so clean that this discrepency was quite jarring. Also, this location is great to get to downtown locations but there are also a lot of homeless people in this area. My understanding is that they are not supposed to ask you for money, but if seeing homeless people is something that you don't like to see on vacation, this may not be the spot for you. Tips: (1) Internet access in your room is available for a fee ($12, I think), but if you go in the lobby you can get connected for free. (2) If you are going to be staying a night or two in San Diego before a cruise, you can actually walk down to thte terminal from the hotel. A taxi would also be inexpensive, but if there are more than two cruise ships departing from San Diego, you may be better off just walking (and the walk is all downhill). (3) For a really nice breakfast, try St. Tropez, which is right across the street near Horton Plaza. Ask the concierge for directions if my direcctions are lacking. The breakfasts are really good, and the roasted potatoes are sauteed with rosemary and are crisp and delicious. All in all, I'd stay here again.

Totally expected, and this is what gives an older property it's charm. Rooms can be odd sizes and hallways can lead to nowhere, but the finishes and quality were flawless. Speaking of rooms, I was upgraded to a large corner room. White walls set off by dark Wenge wood floors, dramatic original art, flat screen TV, a large desk area, and an enormous bathroom and dressing area made this room terrific. I did notice noise from the windows, and I also noticed noise from the creaky floors in some of the hallways. The hotel has a really cool urban vibe that sits really comfortably with the historic nature of the property. The staff was always professional and friendly. The restaurant and lounge are simply stunning. Comfortable, funky and expensive feeling. Very easy to find a little area with a couch and a couple of chairs to hang out and people watch or meet up with friends.

We were immediately greeted by a friendly face in the corridor, then off to the front desk for check in. Magdelane checked us in and was very friendly and helpful with restaurant recommendations nearby. Our room was perfect except for one detail. It was a corner room and because the hotel was not allowed to change the windows due to historical significance it was in a word loud. Although the loud a/c unit drowned out a good bit of the outdoor, traffic noise. Aside from that, the room was very clean and beautiful with a comfortable bed and nice bathroom. The next day we were up early and consulted with Mark Peak, Chief Concierge on ideas of things to do and travel plans due to not renting a car. He was extremely professional, helpful and kind. We decided to purchase the Old Town Trolley tour and we took off at the 9:30 departure from Horton's Plaza. We enjoyed the trolley tour and spent most of our day hopping on and off at Coronado and Old Town. We we arrived back at the hotel we hit happy hour at Ra and the Yard House. Then it was off to Bertrand's at Mister A's for dinner. Cab cost $6 one way. The view was fabulous from the deck and the service and food were wonderful. The following morning we shopped at Horton's Plaza, a wonderful outdoor mall. Upon check out I asked Magdelane about the noise and if they would have moved us to another room had we requested it, she said yes. One other note regarding the local element of people.

I must say at this point that during my week long stay I found all of the staff to be so kind and friendly, I never went unacknowledged, whether I was just passing reception or doormen etc. Just a smile or a hello, nothing irritating like American conversation that never ends!

Another thing I discovered was that it was very difficult for the air conditioner to keep the room at a comfortable temperature, and there was no way to open a window. The only way I was able to keep the room at a comfortable sleeping temperature (could not get the room below 72 degrees ever) was to keep the AC fan on \"high\" all night long. The problem with the \"high\" setting is the amount of noise the fan puts out...very loud.

The hotel is really quite beautiful and the location is excellent...right in the heart of town, near the Gaslamp District and Horton Plaza. An expensive hotel, but we received lots of amenities included in our package price. The area is frequented by homeless people, as the bus terminal and tram to Mexico is nearby, but they do not cause any major safety or security concerns. The hotel is not very happy about their being there, though. We were promised an upgrade to our room by our travel agent, and were very pleased to receive this upgrade. The room was very nice, but there were some disappointments. First, there was a huge mirror that was just sitting on the floor, not mounted on a wall. The A/C system had to work really hard to keep the room at a comfortable temperature. There was not a great deal of storage space in the room, and the bathroom could have benefitted from a corner table to hold the toiletries, as the modern sink took up most of the space on the vanity. It would have been nice to have a bath as well as a shower (not the most powerful of showers, but survivable). The kleenex ran out and was not replaced; there was a lightup make up mirror in the room that did not work, and while reported, was never replaced. We were also disappointed that we had to call to get the room cleaned one afternoon at 3PM. We also had some difficulties with checkout, in that our credits were not applied properly, and it took much much longer to check out than we would have liked, owing to having to negotiate all the credits in order to receive an accurate bill. On the upside, free bottled water in the room, large \"living\" area in the room, decent flat screen TV, friendly room service staff, a most excellent and helpful concierge service; even though we faced the main street, reasonably quiet; a nice restaurant in the hotel, although we thought some of the wait staff did not behave as professionally as we would have liked.

The rate for my room was $139, plus $17.50 for local taxes, per night. On the Web, I saw that the retail rate for the room is around $340/night, if I recall correctly. The hotel-- what I saw of it-- is beautifully decorated. It was completely remodeled a couple of years ago, and it looks to me as though they spared no expense. It really is a beautiful hotel. Unfortunately, most of the beautiful decoration is wasted on me... I felt that it was like perfume on a pig. In my room, the carpet on the floor looked to have been custom-made to fit the room. It was wall-to-wall, and the middle portion was a decorative pattern, surrounded by a dark border that went all around the room, effectively framing the pattern in the middle just like a framed picture. I couldn't tell what it was made of-- wool or something else-- but it was probably the nicest carpet I've ever had the pleasure to walk around barefoot on. The bathroom floor and shower were tiled with some kind of stone. I suppose it could have been man-made, but looked like real stone to me. It seemed to be similar to travertine, but the color was like milk coffee... a very light brown. The headboard of the bed was some kind of giant canvas, on which an \"artist\" had sketched some kind of characterization of people or something. I'm not an aficionado of art; looking at this drawing, I couldn't help but to wonder if the artist responsible could actually draw a realistic, recognizable human figure, or just this distorted stuff. I thought that if he could actually draw a skillful, accurate, recognizable image of a person, it would somehow make it less unreasonable/more tolerable for him to turn out these nearly unrecognizable sketches, which for all I know could have been made by an orangutan or an elephant. I'm sure the hotel paid this guy thousands of dollars, as his stuff seemed to be nearly everywhere in the hotel. Anyway, as you can see in the pictures-- taken with my cell phone, so I'm sorry they're not better quality-- the room is very well-decorated, with some unusual touches, like an enormous mirror that leaned against the wall near the front door. But from a functional standpoint, I thought there was some room for improvement. For one thing, the room really isn't so big. That's not a deal-breaker, as I only use the room for sleeping. It also wasn't very well lighted, which I didn't appreciate. The windows were single-pane, and quite a bit of street noise comes through. The bed was much too soft, and even though I brought my own pillow, I found it to be far too soft for me. At home, I have a pretty firm mattress, and it hurts my back when I sleep on a bed that is too soft. The bed was also covered with a thick down comforter, which is too much blanket for the sort of weather one experiences in San Diego in October. So I didn't sleep very well. Aside from that, the staff at the hotel was great, and overall I enjoyed my stay. If I can get a firmer mattress next time, I'd be happy to return to this hotel. It is located in the middle of the so-called gaslamp area, and there are great restaurants all around it, including a Yardhouse-- a personal favorite-- right across the street.", "Date": "October 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "hartford, ct", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "chung0912", "ReviewID": "UR20611464", "Content": "We stayed at the US Grant for 1 night and it was wonderful.

One of the shortcomings of this property was obvious when we pulled up to the curb to check in \u2013 the valet parking situation is lousy for this grade of hotel. The interior driveway is closed and since the crew was not prepared for the rush of Friday arrivals, we had to wait in a line amongst the street traffic for our turn. There was no one to help us with our bags but once inside, check-in was professional and prompt. However, in spite of my SPG status and because I had negotiated their lowest rate, we were assigned a NS King on the somewhat shabby lowest level. The room was very small and even thought the hotel has been updated recently, it already appears dated and worn. The bathroom had limited counter space and has a modern bowl sink which seems out of place in this historic setting. We had to run the AC unit on the noisy high setting to get the room moderately cool. I understand that this hotel is used for high profile special event dinners and receptions, but I am at a loss as to why. One of my main complaints about this property is that the hotel lobby environment is not conducive to hanging out and the receception/concierge desks are back in the corners so there is no interaction with the desk staff as the guests enter and leave the hotel. On a positive note, housekeeping was thorough and offered a nice turn down service. As far as location, the hotel is conveniently located on the edge of the Gaslamp District, but it is surrounded by dilapidated and abandoned buildings. Every one that we came into contact with was pleasant and helpful, but there are too many negatives to ignore.

I do have a few grudges against them: (1) In a top hotel in S. California, I would really expect a swimming pool. Their explanation was 'because of the historical nature of our hotel, there is no pool'. Well, the historical nature has not stopped them from sticking a gym, wifi access (free in the lobby) and convention rooms there, so that is a lame excuse. They do let you use the pool of another hotel next door, but it was not very good. (2) The service is sometimes over the top. They go around doing their room cleaning in the morning, then in the afternoon they bring you some mineral water (why not leave the bottles at the cleaning time?). Finally, they do an evening shift asking whether you would need some ice. So no sooner than you get back to your room, take your clothes off before nipping to the shower, someone knocks the door, offering you water or ice etc. Sometimes that felt too much. Why not sticking an ice machine there? The historical nature I guess. (3) In the end, they wanted to charge us an awful lot of money for stuff from the minibar we did not take, but without any questions corrected the bill when I complained . They also charge 2 bucks for each toll-free (1-800) phonecall from the room, something no other American hotel does in my experience. But overall, a very positive experience.

I convinced my company to put us up there when I realized the deal through my Starwood Preferred membership was better than what we would have gotten at the Marriott on the harbor. I am such a fan, usually, of Starwood resorts and the photos of the property looked phenomenal. The rate was $289/nt. We drove in from LA and went straight to the conference, not arriving at the hotel until 4 p.m. Check-in is 3 p.m., but one of our two rooms was not yet available. The desk clerk assured me it would be ready in about 15 mins. While I was a bit annoyed that as a Preferred guest, my room was NOT ready at check-in, I agreed to wait in my colleague's room. After 45 mins, my room was STILL not ready and I had to call down to the desk twice to get anyone to help me. After explaining that I really wanted to take a shower and get ready for the evening event I was attending, they finally upgraded me to a Jr. Suite up the hall. The room itself was fantastic and the furnishings, wood floors, bath, linens, acoutrements, LCD televisions (there were two!) were all top notch. My colleague's deluxe room was gorgeously appointed, too, and had I not been upgraded for free, I probably wouldn't spend the extra on the Jr. Suite. The bathroom was actually SMALLER in my room than in hers. The second night we were there, I called down to ask for extra towels and they never came. The housekeeper had taken all of my dirty towels, but not replenished the supply. I had to call again to get the towels finally. Upon checkout, we noticed that my colleague's room was still attached to my credit card even though she had given HER credit card upon check-in. They had to re-run the charge on hers and remove it from my credit card. When she got her bill, they had actually charged her twice! The hotel is well-located near the Gaslamp and the seaport and is truly a beautiful hotel (they have done a fine job modernizing this classic beauty).

We had reserved a top floor room with king size bed which upon arrival were told they were sold out and only had double beds available. After a moment or two the receptionist found a small suite on the 8th floor. We were aware of the noise potential problem but figured eight floors up we'd be ok and we were. The windows did rattle when the air conditioner went on and off due to the pressure change but not enough to keep us awake. The room was decorated very nicely with a great wall to wall persian style rug, wonderful linens and a great bed. One problem, no shower curtain.

I really loved this hotel. It's gorgeous if you like old-school historic hotels. Positives: Great location if you want to stay in downtown San Diego. Directly across the street from Horton Plaza Mall (cool outdoor multilevel mall - great shopping and great food court. I highly recommend the mexican take out place in the food court, really yummy!) Customer service is outstanding. Loved the bellmen and the valet. They are true professionals and charming. Offered great directions everywhere I needed to go. Beautiful, i mean really beautiful huge lobby with gorgeous furniture, lots of couches everything. Everything really beautifully done. This place has undergone massive renovations and you have to give them kudos for doing an amazing job of restoring it to its (i'm assuming) former glory. Chocolates on the pillow every night. And not just any chocolate. Really good chocolate! Excellent \"free\" coffee available just inside the restaurant entryway every morning, with to-go cups. Bathroom in my room was wonderful, fully redone. Loved the towels, toiletries, full size blowdryer, nicest iron & board i've ever seen in a hotel room. Beautiful furniture in room. Really comfy bed. Great pillows. Free wi-fi. Worked great. Negatives: I had a room right next to the elevators. Loud weird noises (i'm assuming these were elevator related noises...or else...ghosts? :-) throughout the night, as well as people being noisy coming and going from the elevators. Luckily i always travel with ear plugs which helped somewhat. I did specifically ask for a room away from the elevators, but pretty much every hotel i know of always says there are no guarantees with exact room location you get. No self-parking available, and you're right in the middle of downtown, so street parking is pretty much impossible or highly unlikely. Attendant/valet/bellman are not right outside of the front entrance of hotel, they are outside of the side entrance. This took some time to find and get to since you deal with lots of one way streets downtown. They should really give people a heads up in advance for this. Valet parking was $30 a day. However, I always feel compelled to tip every time I gave my car to the valet or got it out of valet, so this adds up quickly! Downtown San Diego is the only area in San Diego where you pay for parking. They do have great transportation options downtown, so as long as you aren't planning to be anywhere other than downtown, you won't need a car. You can walk, take the trolley, taxis, buses, etc. However, if you want to go to the beach, SeaWorld, the Zoo, etc., you will need a car. This is not a place to stay if you want to go to the beach in San Diego. If you want a hotel by the beach in San Diego, definitely look elsewhere! Room service at this hotel is incredibly expensive. One night i was feeling sick, and did not want to have to go out anywhere to eat so I ordered a ceasar salad with shrimp and one glass of wine. This cost close to $60 with the tax and tip (already on the bill - beware - there is also the extra line on the bill to write in a tip even though it has already been added in to the cost!) Plus the shrimp on my ceasar salad were yucky - and there were only 3. They still had their legs, and the excrement line unremoved. The salad dressing was scarce, couldn't hardly even taste it. I wound up eating about two bites of my $35 salad. The glass of wine was tasty though! The room service was supposedly from the restaurant downstairs, which they tout as being one of the best in San Diego. I never ate actually in the restaurant so I can not judge it. It looked nice! I also have to say that the person who delivered the room service was very polite and very nice. At night, there are homeless people and/or druggies lurking around everywhere on the streets surrounding the hotel who aggressively ask for money (following you, yelling, etc.) I live in Seattle where we unfortunately have a homeless problem as well. I don't generally have problems with homeless people, but they were particularly aggressive here. One night i walked back to the hotel from a restaurant at Horton Plaza (right across the street) and was harassed by a man. I think he was either stoned or drunk. I was a little bit scared by this. I would recommend not walking around at night in this area alone. The view outside my window was of other windows in other sections of the hotel, plus the roof of a lower area of the hotel with trash discarded on top of it. At night the hotel has red lights all around the hotel shining onto it (I have no idea why they would choose to shine red lights on their hotel?), which comes through the windows. They have thick curtains on the windows that blocks out most of it. One other negative: they made a mistake on my bill. They charged me for two cars in valet parking. It may have been an honest mistake since I switched out my rental car for a different one. I explained this when I returned to the hotel with a different car, but apparently it got entered in the system as a second vehicle instead of a replacement.

This hotel is a beautiful historic hotel - it's celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2008, and you can see the sense of history everywhere you go in the hotel. The furniture, the furnishings, artwork, etc. were all chosen because of their historical significance. Good things about the hotel: 1) Location - it's right across from Horton Plaza and the Gaslamp Quarters, so you have shopping and eating right on your doorstep. There is a convenient store a few blocks up (Rite-Aid). If you don't have a car, the bus stop is right across the street, and the tram is behind the hotel. Very convenient location! 2) History - this hotel is great for history buffs. Ask the concierge for a free tour of the hotel. They'll take you on a private tour (approx 1 hour) of the public and private areas of the hotel. It's well worth your time! 3) Concierge service - this is a Luxury Collection hotel, so you expect the service to be top-notch. I wasn't disappointed! The concierge was very helpful in securing restaurant reservations and more important, the photo safari reservation at the Wild Animals Park. 4) Free wireless Internet in the lobby - don't bother paying for Internet service in your room. 5) Restaurant - the Grant Grill is one of the top restaurants in the city. We unfortunately didn't get to try it, but we heard great things about it from the locals while we were in SD. Not-so-good things: 1) The room - the room is a bit small, but it's likely because this is an older hotel. The bathroom is at least a fair size so no complaints there. The room is beautifully furnished though - the bed was very comfortable, and there was original artwork in every room (by the same artist) above the bed. The TV wasn't flat screen either. 2) Valet parking - $30 a day (with in and out privileges) to park at the hotel! We thought LA was expensive, but this was worse! There are other parking lots around the area if you look carefully that'll be cheaper, but they might not be as safe. 3) Downtown San Diego - downtown is not as exciting as I thought it would be, because at night, the area gets a bit \"seedy\". Even the Gaslamp Quarter isn't as lively as expected. If you have to stay in downtown San Diego and you don't mind a smaller room, then US Grant is a great hotel to stay. You definitely feel pampered while you're there. But if you have a choice, stay in La Jolla instead, where it's a lot livelier in the evenings.", "Date": "March 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cUS Grant\u201d", "Author": "justpastone", "ReviewID": "UR14076816", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed at The US grant as part of a longer road trip for two nights. I booked the hotel based on the excellent reviews it had received on trip advisor, and the general appearance from travellers photos, and indeed the hotel was lovely and the pictures did it justice. Unfortunately, we arrived later then expected, and being on a road trip, we arrived rather more scruffy than the average clientele. This was reflected by the man at the check in desk who took a very snooty attitude to the way we looked. I have stayed in quite a number of 5 star hotels, and haven't always arrived looking smart, but I have never received the sort of look I did from this man. We took our own bags to our room - no bell hop was offered. The room was nice, if a little small, it was only just possible to open the bathroom door, as the bed was in the way. I had booked a superior room, but would be interested to know what the difference is between the the room I booked and a standard room, as it can not be size. Bathroom also had no bath. The other issue I had were with the lack of things in the room. I had to call guest services to get a coffee maker, somewhat of a standard in most hotel rooms, and then coffee mugs (which didn't come with the coffee maker) and then wine glasses. It got a little boring ringing down, especially when I had to do the same thing again the following day, as everything had been taken away. I also felt uncomfortable about the homeless people in the park right outside the hotel. I am an early morning walker, and if the overriding smell of urine wasn't bad enough, the pan handling was very pleasant especially for a woman on her own.

Across the street from a great mall with outdoor walkways. Restaurants galore in the area, including a great bar restaurant across the street with over 100 different types of beer on tap, very unique.

The room also had a gigantic framed mirror leaning up against one wall. We had a medium sized flat screened TV, a desk and nice sized closet. Coffee and tea pod maker in the room.

The hotel is well located in the central downtown area directly across the street from Horton Plaza, a nice semi-outdoor shopping complex that includes a Nordstroms and Macys. I was in San Diego for a meeting and was able to walk to the convention center in about 15 minutes. The hotel is quite impressive from the outside. It is a classic design and has the presence of an established landmark. The inside is equally impressive with an expansive lobby. Check in was smooth and efficient. My room was visually appealing with a nice king size bed, a side table with CD clock radio, a 32 inch LCD, etc. The bathroom was somewhat modern with a great basin although there was only a shower and no tub available in my room. The Grant Grill is their only restaurant. I enjoyed the food there and everything seemed well-prepared. There are many nearby alternatives not only at Horton Plaza but all along the Gas Light District as well as near the convention center. I was able to easily find a Mortons, a Flemings, a Rock Bottom, and many local establishments. The health club is fairly nice although small. The equipment appears quite new and includes built-in television feeds. a Just for reference, there are a few issues that should be noted. Although I find the nearby areas interesting, there are quite a large number of homeless people even directly across the street. One morning, I counted at least 30 homeless types (sleeping bags + carts) well within 50 yards of the hotel\u2019s front entrance. I was never bothered by anyone, but if you have anxiety after dark in those situations, you might just want to be aware of it. In addition, there was an error on my bill that developed because the minibr fridge automatically charges you when the items in the fridge are moved. I told them I was just seeing what was in there, but it would be nice for them to confirm the use before charging since the sensor seems quite sensitive. Overall, I enjoyed my stay. I would likely consider staying again although I might opt for the $100 suite upgrade that was offered to me when I made my reservation. Since I was there by myself, I declined.

The goal: to view the Dead Sea Scrolls. (Read the bottom for my point in telling you that I searched the internet -- you'll love it!) As a single parent and a high school teacher, I am always on a budget. I do, however, prefer to stay at hotels, not motels, that offers that extra touch of class. Such as the orchid and ti leaf leis that the Westin Maui greets its guests with or the free room upgrade and creamy chocolate mousse drops at Costa Rica's Hotel Grano de Oro. The US Grant is one of these hotels. We booked the 9 a.m. viewing of the Scrolls and were done sooner than expected. I called the hotel and requested an early check in -- no problem, which is great, especially if you have two teens who felt like they spent way too much time looking at old pieces of scrap paper! The hotel is aesthetically pleasing. The room we were given was also above average, boasting a flat screen television, marble bathroom, SO comfortable beds with crisp, but smooth, linens. I also love it when the rooms come with plush robes. The toiletries were a treat (Gilchrist & Soames), which may be a small thing to some, but to me, it makes a world of difference! If location is important, the Grant is the answer! The Gaslamp Quarter, along with a huge mall is directly across the street. Little Italy is about a five minutes drive or 20-30 minutes walk. I wouldn't, though, recommend walking too much at night since I saw a few shady characters and homeless people (?). There is one negative to the US Grant--parking is a nightmare, which almost forces guests to hand over $30 for valet parking. The other option is paying for public parking ($12-15), but as I mentioned, the characters I saw are questionable. Overall, the US Grant is a place I will return to.

The staff throughout the stay were unusually friendly and helpful, which is obviously the result of some great training. The location of the hotel, right on the edge of the Gaslamp District, is superb with many great restaurants and shopping choices within steps (including Horton Plaza mall which is directly across the street). We stayed in a \u201cLandmark Suite\u201d (which is one of their mid-sized suites). The suite was pretty impressive with modern and comfortable furnishings and amenities including a Bose stereo, separate living room, modern marble bathroom, etc. I would estimate it to be around 500 sq. ft. The room decor was fresh and done in an \"old meets new\" motif with traditional style moldings and carpets juxtaposed against modern halogen lighting and flat panel TVs, etc. Due to the location of the hotel, the view from the room was non-existent (not surprising). Strangely, despite the recent $50 million plus renovation, the room windows are of the old single-pane variety whereas modern double glazing would be helpful in cutting out street noise. The lobby is beautiful but didn't knock our socks off. I think they could have made it truly spectacular by restoring the old wooden surfaces and Corinthian columns to their original 1910 glory rather than cladding the columns in beige marble and painting the carved tops in a blue distressed looking metallic finish of questionable taste, as they have done. As a result, the lobby, with its huge glittering crystal chandeliers, has an almost Vegas-like grandeur without the historical authenticity that it rightly deserves. Overall though, they have created a modern and comfortable hotel while retaining some of the historical charm of the building.

I initially chose it for it's history and recent remodel. The hotel is smack dab in middle of gaslamp district with plenty of shops, restaurants, clubs within walking distance. Trolley and bus stops are steps away from hotel doors. Hotel itself is gorgeous! **Ask concierge to view the hotel's archive photgraph book.** I booked the romatic getaway package for about $300 per night. This was supposed to include king bed room with view, floral arrangement, champagne, and breakfast up to $50. The room itself was fabulous and I was pleasantly surprised as it looked much like the pictures from hotel website. It was also clean and well decorated. It was extremely quiet and I never once heard anyone next door - as is usually the case in hotel rooms. Now here were my issues: The room had a view of parking structure and a condemned graffitied building behind that. Shortly after we arrived to our room, a maid entered without knocking to ask about turn down service (which I thought odd). The bottle of champagne was probably one of the worst tasting champagnes I've ever had. I certaintly wasn't expecting Dom but I did expect a nice Verve or Piper. The flowers didn't arrive until the second day - halfway through our trip. The breakfast was excellent. I highly recommend their version of hash browns - it's flavored with shitake and the subtle flavor of mushroom infused into the potatoes is very tasty.

We stayed at the U.S. Grant for six nights 7/26-8/1. This hotel is absolutely beautiful and the service is top-notch. I highly recommend it. I can't say enough about how nice every hotel employee is. The location is great, very close to some wonderful restaurants in the Gaslamp District and right across the street from Horton Plaza. I stayed with my husband and two children, 8 and 10 years old, in a room with double beds. Our room was a nice size and well appointed. Keep in mind that there are only showers in all but a few rooms - this was not a problem for us. There are two robes in the closet for your use. I needed more hangers which were brought up within a few minutes after I requested them. If you are easily bothered by noise, then definitely request an inside room as suggested by another reviewer. Our room was right next to the elevator so we could hear it through the night as well as the people in the hallway. I did not want to pack up and move to a different room, so we found a simple solution to cover up the noise by turning the A/C fan on to low or medium - perfect white noise. Our friends has an outside suite and heard noise until late in the night from the bar across the street. I told them about my fan trick and it worked for them. This hotel does an excellent job at making their guests feel welcome. We found the staff to be most friendly and accomodating - it is obvious they are out to please. We were greeted with a hello and a smile by every employee that we passed. The doormen and valets even remembered our names. They also make great recommendations for restaurants and give very helpful driving directions. The only slightly negative experience was with the housekeeping. They often took our four wet towels to replace them with two or three new towels. I had to call Guest Services daily to have them send up more towels - which they did quickly and with a smile. In the sceme of things, this wasn't really a serious issue, especially with the way they took care of it! Also, they let us have extra towels to take to the local beaches!!! The Grant Grill is quite expensive, about $80.00 for a breakfast for four, and not the best choice for kids (items were too 'gourmet' for my kids!). We found a great local diner - The Cheese Shop - that served the best, huge breakfast. We also had great meals at Hard Rock, Sammy's Pizza, and Croce's.
