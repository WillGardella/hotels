One of our rooms was given away without notice. We contacted them three times to confirm our bookings. All was good until we arrived. We found out that they only booked us one room with two beds. Then to make matters more interesting, we were charged full amount for two rooms. We tried talking to the staff there, however we were told to go elsewhere if we didnt like the service.

If you're in dire need of a place to lay your head, and you're REALLY trying to save some cash (even though its way too expensive for what you're getting) then the Tropicana is the place...But, if you're looking for a pleasurable, clean, trouble-free experience, look elsewhere...The rooms are grimy, the hotel smells like a blend of rotting Arabic food and a nursing home and the service is absolutely appalling.I got to my room and noticed there wasn't any clean towels. So, like most, I proceeded to ask the manager if I may have some clean towels. She called me a liar, saying the towels in my room are clean. I guess clean towels have brown, moist spots all over them???The owners of the this hotel our flat out mean. They treat you like they hate the fact that you're staying at their hotel.

She wanted us to pay cash, and when we didnt come right back to her with the dollerbills she de-authorised our keycard so we couldnt get back into the room instead of just askeing us! Their choice of air freshner was a little odd too, curry, cucumber and onions i think?!? When i come back to San Fran i will stay in the Haight area, or near Golden Gate Park, there are too many burnt out bumbs in this neighbourhood..

Trust me, don't ever try this terrible hotel!I stayed there for ten days for the 2005 June SF Pride. At first i thought it's a clean neat and cheap accomodation option. It turned out the service was horrifying. Of the ten days i stayed, no one ever cleaned the room. Not even once! I even had to beg for new towels myself. The hotel is owned and run by an Indian family. The father and mother were just mean. The old mother is called Fatima, who's always at the counter handling hotel matters, including bookings and registration. Their website says they only accept cash, traveller's check or payment via paypal. But when i proposed to pay via paypal for my added stay at the hotel, she refused BECAUSE only her son knows about their hotel's paypal account! I had to convince her to call her son on the cell phone before i could settle the payment by paypal. So never trust what they say on their web. They don't even have a proper payment system!And... the more unbelievable happened on the day i checked out. My return flight was at 9 at night. I checked out at 1pm, thinking i could leave one of my luggages at their place or counter so i could do some final shoppings or running around before heading to the airport. BUT Fatima refused to keep my luggage, claiming that they don't have room for luggages! She even went so far as to say that no hotels will provide luggage storage! She added that even though my room was vacant for the day, they couldn't leave my luggages there BECAUSE they had to clean the room! (wow, they finally realized they had to clean the room!!) Knowing that i couldn't reason with her, i proposed to pay a few hours rental for my luggage. And u know how much she said she would charge me? - 35 dollars!!! God, their weekly room rate per night is only 50 dollars! I was so angry and dragged my luggage out of their premise, claiming that i will never go back and make sure that everyone knows about how bad their service is.And i think i'm not the only victim to their horrendous service. I recall one night some police officers had to come over and intervene in a money dispute between Fatima and some bewildered customers in backpacks sitting at the hotel lobby. I wasn't sure about the details of the dispute. I only overheard the police officer telling Fatima calm down and be more flexible and suggested the hotel should return the downpayment back to the two waiting customers so that they could leave and find another hotel. I have reasons to believe that things like this may happen a lot there.So, if u want some quality time visiting San Francisco, stay away from this --- hotel.

Other hotels were charging over $100 a nite but this place beat it by 50%. If you want a no thrills hotel which includes a refrigerator/microwave and more television channels then a lot of the high priced hotels, this is a definite option! It is centrally located off the BARTS 16th and Mission Street station so I had no problem getting off the train and walking the two blocks to the hotel. There are tons of buses that will get you everywhere you need to go. I truly enjoyed my stay and the hotel manger made it feel like a home away from home. I definite recommend you take a room with a private bath but I checked out the bath/shower room and it was always spotless and sweekie clean! They don't take credit cards so it's all cash but don't worry about having the right amount, theirs an ATM located right outside of the building. I think this place is great and I encourage the frugal travelers to consider this place the next time they plan to head out to San Francisco.

I was moving there and needed a place to stay while looking for an apartment. Basically, this place was an SRO years ago, and was taken over, remodeled and turned into a sort of europeanish hotel. It's basically a decent step up from staying at a hostel. I got a private room, all the appliances were new, in fact all the furniture is also new. For 250 (they were running a special) I got a room with a sink/bed/fridge/micro (decent sized fridge)/TV/Cable and wireless internet access. Considering I looked around, this was the best deal (the few cheaper places weren't much cheaper, and the more expensive places were around 350/wk). If I had opted to pay 350/week, I could have had a private bathroom. For what I needed it was perfect, though by the end of the stay (2 weeks) I was tired of schlepping down the hall to shower or go to the bathroom (though it did save me $200 total). The room was comfortable and the place was quiet and centrally located. It's not the ritz, but for the price, it's a decent value. It's true about the cash only policy, which I thought a little weird, but whatever. The owners also appear to live on the second floor, so I very often came home to the smell of cooking (usually curry) and that's a mixed bag. Sometimes I liked it, and it made me hungry, other times I would have preferred not to smell it, but I was staying on the third floor and my room always smelled nice. Another potential annoyance is if you take the shared shower setup, you always run the risk of having to wait for the shower (which happened to me once, and was a potential annoyance making me worry about being late for a work meeting). There is a shower on the other side, which I ended up using. That could potentially be a hassle, but again, it's a budget place so you have to give something up for that.If you're planning on staying in SF and don't want to hostel it, this is definitely worth it. It's not exactly comparable to a hotel (unless you get a private bathroom), it's more like a clean dorm room without the parties. Frankly, the next cheapest thing I could find in a real hotel was at least $60 a night (so $420 a week, not including tax). Overall, if you need a cheap place and prefer at least some modicum of privacy, I'd recommend.", "Date": "Apr 19, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR652874266", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Staff helped me find my luggage....
