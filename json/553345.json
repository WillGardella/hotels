The establishment was very accommodating to our needs. We were pleasantly suprised by the size of the rooms-they were not small claustrophobice sze rooms like so many hotels we have stayed in for the same prize. Excellent location, just 1 block from I-5 . We have stayed at differemt America's Best Value in California and we've never been disappointed. We always look for these first before we decide on lodging whenever we travel. We always get a great deal for the money. Of course look for their promotionals to get the best price and book early if possible to get the ideal rooms.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cFantastic... this made my business trip seem like leisure time.\u201d", "Author": "januaryLAngelle", "ReviewID": "UR102448541", "Content": "I take many business trips all across the country each year. On this trip, my husband accompanied me . He and I are both sticklers for a clean and spacious room. When we arrived, the staff was gracious and polite, clear and concise and we were in our room within moments. Upon entering the room, much to our surprise, the size of the room was quite large with extremely high ceilings which gave the room an even larger feel. There was a desk and couch to relax in, for my business needs, Wifi and all the amenities that one would need for an extended business trip. The bed was very comfortable and the room was one of the cleanest I have ever been in. The housekeeping staff was readily available in the morning with fresh towels and happy smiles. A lovely array of danishes, muffins, juice and coffe awaited us downstairs in the lobby each morning. This room was A+ in my book. Lastly, what impressed me most was the friendly faces of the staff. Everyone was there to meet my needs... it seemed their motto was \"customer first.\" -January L'Angelle", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego,ca", "Title": "\u201cBusiness class.\u201d", "Author": "Dodgeamor", "ReviewID": "UR94766936", "Content": "I have been traveling to Granada Hills on business for several weeks and have stayed at everything from the local cheap motel to a four star. Of the places I've stayed I found the simple amenities (Microwave and Fridge) to be the best thing in travel. They also offer Tea and coffee (the good stuff, not some cheap generic) which is nice before bed and in the morning and someone is making homemade muffins and hit it dead on.. Banana Blueberry... from someone that hates nuts and loves banana muffins it was a pleasent surprise. The rooms are clean, have a couch, desk, the usuals, and the beds were in good shape (didn't feel the springs poking through.. won't mention the name of the hotel where that was a standard feature) and the internet was very realiable and free of charge (recommend the wired connection. I will be using this hotel as my regular place. The price is only a few more dollars then some cheap motel, but to know your car is being watched and the neighborhood is good, plus two decent gas stations stores accrossed the street. This place is well worth it. I'd actually pay more because of peice of mind.", "Date": "January 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canyon Country, California", "Title": "\u201cThe rooms are large and reasonably priced\u201d", "Author": "carjen15", "ReviewID": "UR88698110", "Content": "The rooms are large and reasonably price.

When we entered, the room was at least 130 degrees F, the heat hit us like a wall. The air conditioner ran ok for about 10 minutes, and then powered down to only the fan, and never cooled the room down. We could hear it trying to go back to the cooler air, but the switch kept turning off again. The thermostat could not be turned down any more, it was just giving up. It also was the loudest air conditioner I've ever had to suffer through. We would have changed rooms, but we had to be up early in the morning, so we needed to sleep, which proved to be difficult, with the noise and the hot room. The only advantage to the loud air conditioner that did not work was the \"white noise\" it provided when someone pulled into the parking lot below our window and played their huge bass pounding car stereo for 10 minutes or more at about 12:30 AM, all the while yelling and laughing. No, we would not recommend this hotel at any price. It was the most basic of motels, third world quality. The room was clean enough, but they did leave a used wash cloth in the shower. For us the location was good, because it was the closest to our friend's house, but in the end, we paid for the convience! I clicked on \" low value\" because it was simply wrong to be in a room that hot with no recourse.....it was not worth it at any price as far as I am concerned!", "Date": "July 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "sfo", "Title": "\u201cClean and reasonably priced\u201d", "Author": "letsgotravelasap", "ReviewID": "UR34121473", "Content": "This is a small but clean and reasonably priced hotel.
