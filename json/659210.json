{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Not worth the money This hotel was old and dirty. My first night there I went to take a shower and the water was a yellowish brown for the first few mins. I'm here in China on a tour so some of my tour group told me it might be rust or something. It made me wonder when the room was last cleaned if rust could build up that much. Since our tour group was booked well in advance, and they met us at the airport with all of our room keys, I would THINK they would have cleaned the room one more time before we arrived, but I guess it was too much of an effort! We stayed here 5 nights and the rest of the time the water ran clear each time I ran it.As for the staff, it was pretty much hit or miss. Some people where helpful and some not so much. I just tried to remember the friendly helpful faces, and steered clear of the others.The location is pretty good. Within walking distance of a lot of tourist attractions and the taxis didn't seem to have a problem with finding it. I would say all in all, the value isn't here in this hotel. I walked up one block and I believe it was a Hyatt that was there and absolutely beautiful. My friend on the tour checked the rates and it was actually cheaper to stay there then at the Beijing Hotel. Understand though, I beileve our tour leader got taken advantage of and was charged a premium rate for our rooms. One of the group told me we were paying over $250 US a night. We arrived on a Sunday evening and left on a friday morning. Also everything was priced at a premium. Bottled water was $10 USAll in all I was very disappointed in this hotel. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and they seem to like to bill themselves as a luxury hotel, when I would rate them a bit below a Holiday Inn but better than a motel 6.", "Date": "Sep 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR181162139", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "warytraveler01"}, {"Content": "Excellent location       The bathroom.", "Date": "Apr 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR269442200", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "7stars"}, {"Content": "appalling service with stroppy staff We stayed at this hotel for a business trip organised by my husbands work.

The arrangements were done through our country by a travel agency who was an intermediate with a travel company in China. When we expected to arrive to the other hotel (in the same block), the guide left us at the Beijing Hotel. In the Lobby, the guide helped us with the check in because the people at the front desk have very limited English. Not enough for a check in. We were given rooms at the 7th floor.The lobby is big, but not cozy or luxurious. It is fool of people shouting as in a market. After taking old elevators we arrived to the floor our rooms were at. The halls were dark and everything was old and shabby. The rooms were no improvement. They had a good size for a four star hotel (they told us at the arrival it was 5). But everything was terrible! Old TV, ugly bathroom, and everything was dirty. However, the worst was the smell. It was as mixture of bathroom smell with humidity, as the one you find in a cave. We called the front desk and told them the problem. After a while we talked to a person who knew a little bit of English and understood us. They offered to change us to another floor. The next room was bigger and had separated shower and bathtub, but everything was worn. The bed was horrible and it was dark with a very small window.

Both stays were for business, and I was hoping to get the best location to get some last minute shopping done. So, to start off, this hotel enjoys a prime location being next to Wangfujing shopping area, and also the Food Street adjacent to the shopping area. There is a huge bookstore there, and I love books. I picked up some Chinese books for my dad too. Still on location, it's relatively near the Tiananmen Square and Forbidden City. I have visited these two places before in a previous trip, but my (now ex-)boss who was travelling in 2002 with me was simply thrilled to be able to visit the place where thousands were massacred in 1989. I was less morbid, and preferred sticking to happier events such as eating Peking Duck, visiting old Beijing restaurants and seeing friends based in Beijing.Now, on to the service and the rooms and facilities.Service is nothing to rave about, but maybe because I speak Mandarin, I was given fair treatment. There was no issue of miscommunication and I am not demanding by nature. The usual greetings and smiles are all there. Any request for extra towels and cotton buds were acceded to promptly. But there is nothing extra and exceptional.Both times, the standard room I got was in the 'newer' Building A, which was added only about 20 years ago. This hotel, as you'd read from earlier reviews, is 100 years old. Buildings C and D seem to be the older blocks.The room was adequate, with nice, clean bathrooms and all the amenities you'd expect from a 4 or 5-star hotel. The bed is hard, yes, but I love hard beds anyway. The TV channels available are all the local Beijing channels, ALL the state-run channels in all the rest of China's provinces, and some standard international channels such as CNN, BBC, NHK, etc. I enjoyed switching channels to see what the (boring) Chinese channels offer. I tried breakfast only in the first stay, so I dare not say my opinion still remains valid. By and large, the spread was adequate and up to western standards. But I stuck mainly to the Asian fare, and must say the soya bean (dou jiang), fried dough friters (you tiao) and noodles (mian tiao) were fantastic! I drank at the lobby cafe too on both occasions, but I felt the charges were simply too steep. Otherwise, I did not try any of the other restaurants. I'd actually wanted to try the Tan Family Restaurant, after hearing rave reviews about it, but had no time on both occasions.I did not go and see the swimming pool and the other recreational facilities, but from the description of them in the hotel info guide, they are standard fare in Chinese 4 or 5-star hotels. I bet the bowling alley and squash courts are under-utilised. But frm what I understand, back in the 1980s, all Chinese hotels which want to be accredited with 5-star ratings by the government needs to have certain 'additional' facilities such as bowling alley, saunas and public baths, mahjong rooms, mini golf practice range etc. Whether these facilities are ultimately used by guests or not is not important.Now, I've saved the most interesting for the last. As I said, this is a century-old hotel and it's huge. I went to the post office to send some stuff back to my Singapore office, and I must say I have a feeling of going back to 1950s or 60s communist era. It's a very strange feeling, as you walk from the relatively modern lobby of Building A to the post office in Building B. I became curious and decided to explore the lobby of Buildings B and C. The feeling of time travel extended further, and I suddenly saw the tacky decor of old communist China where the state tried to show opulence in red drapings, golden stairways and red carpets. The lanterns in the lobby of Building C looked REALLY quaint and I think this should be the REAL Beijing Hotel, not the one I saw in Building A!I cannot say I dislike or like this quaintness. But I won't want to stay in such a hotel, as previous experiences with old Chinese hotels stuck in the pre-reform era were horrible. I can even surmise the efforts put in by Red Guards in welcoming Preisdent Nixon in 1972, when you see hundreds of young, enthusiastic Chinese scrubbing away the grime and dirt, putting up new banners and decor, etc with that revolutionary zeal! I left the time capsule very soon, as both occasions I was pressed for time. But come this autumn, I may have the chance to stay at the Beijing Hotel. I heard that the venerable Raffles group has taken over managing the older parts of the Beijing Hotel and I am curious how things have changed. The Raffles group is renowned for turning old masterpieces into new gems, retaining that period feel and old-world charm. They did this for the Singapore Raffles, and they did it again for the Grand Hotel d'Angkor at Cambodia's Siem Reap. I would like to see how they fare with the historic Beijing Hotel.", "Date": "Jul 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR192476639", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Sal the Fat Fish"}, {"Content": "Great location, so-so rooms Overall, I'd say this hotel is not worth the price. Pay more for something better, or less for something with more charm, or at least that doesn't nickel and dime you with high prices. If you are at all on a budget, don't think of this as a splurge. It's not worth it.PROS: The location of the hotel can't be beat, whether you want to deal with Wangfujiang shopping street or merely enjoy the fact that the Forbidden City and Tian'anmen Square are fairly close by. Also, being right on the subway is great; Beijing's subway is easily accessible even to non-Mandarin speakers, and if it goes where you want it is terrific. The balcony in my room was a nice plus. Most (but not all) of the staff are helpful, some very helpful, and generally there is someone who speaks good English around. Also, there is a lovely exhibit of Buddhist cave art looted from various caves in the lobby.CONS: My room in Bldg. A smelled bad (not just smoking smell, something far more unpleasant). The staff told me they couldn't move me my first evening without giving me a worse room (hard to believe). The decor is bland and slightly depressing. The bathroom, newly redone, leaked, and the staff kindly put towels down to sop up the constant dribbles of water every time they came in to clean the room or do turndown service. The charge for Internet Access at the Business Center -- 2.6 RMB per minute -- was outrageous even by five star standards (every other five star I stayed at in China charged only 1 RMB per minute), so if you are not traveling with a laptop (as I wasn't, since this was for pleasure), it is not worth using the internet. The woman at the front desk I spoke with said the business center was the only internet option that she knew of (again, everywhere else, I have been able to find alternatives). Room service food (wontons) was the worst I have had in China, though entirely edible. And I was approached in the lobby by young women wanting to practice their English -- a common scam beginning.

The business suite was equipped with a PC with internet service at $2 per hour. The room was immaculate and nicely decorated. It did face building B and had no real view, but it was perfectly quiet. Other people on the tour stayed in Building A and said there rooms were very nice. Some did complain that there was construction going on outside their room all day and night and they had difficulty sleeping. You should make sure your room does not face this construction. They also had a wonderful buffet breakfast, althoygh it was not cheap at about $16 per person. It did have a huge selection of western and Asian hot and cold items, omelettes made to order, etc. Considering its size, they also provided a high level of service. One morning we woke up and went to breakfast before our wake up call. Shortly after we got back there was a bellman banging on our door yelling wake up, wake up !!.

Work reasons got me into Beijing Hotel this time, and it was thoroughly substandard, unpleasant, the kind of place that pushes you out. It was a relief to be getting on the cab the last morning headed for the airport. Historic or not, the place is old, and it's got the smell that constantly reminds you of that. Don't know what kind of star rating this place carries, but it ought to be 2-star.Entering the Building E room I got on the first day, you immediately sense something is out of wack. It's the smell, the tacky furnishing, the bed straight out of any cheap motel room, the depressing carpet, and the needle (and dust and pieces of molding that came off who knows where) so discreetly lodged on the carpet as if waiting for you to walk on without your shoes on. I had trouble explaining to Housekeeping what was wrong, and then waited several more minutes to get a maid in there with a vacuum cleaner.The same thing had happened to me once before at a five-star hotel, and when I quietly explained the problem, the manager bumped me up into a suite. I didn't even dream of that kind of thing here. By the way, what's with the needle and the hotel room, I don't know. Are there a lot of you out there who are into sowing when on trips? I couldn't believe when this happened to me the second time.Anyway, in terms of service, what you get here is staff who don't hesitate to show they are not happy or just not trained. One time, I make eye contact with a staffer to ask a question, and, before I even open my mouth, the person has looked away. Chinese hospitality is not hard to find at upper-class lodgings and restaurants in Beijing, starting with the nice doorman opening the cab door for you. Not here. Cab doors are self-service (with the door guy just staring at you sometimes). I ask for a cab one day, and the doorman shakes his head. He is rejecting my request. It's fine it's a busy time of the day and there are no cabs waiting, but his response was unmistakably, I ain't getting you a cab. If it wasn't that, I had no way of knowing, because of his lack of skill in English.Calls you make for room service meals, housekeeping, etc. are unfailingly answered by curt, almost angry staffers who sound ready to bark at you for your requests.I just can't complain enough about this place, but better stop. You get the idea.One thing this place has going for it is the location. You can't get any closer to city centre if your main reason for being in the city is sightseeing. You're just minutes by foot from Tiannanmen Square and museums.

My colleague booked me into the Beijing Hotel (the older section not the new one with the Outback Steakhouse in it). The hotel is actually a block of hotels on Chang An Avenue (new Beijing Hotel, original Beijing Hotel, and the unaffiliated but physically connected Grand Beijing). The hotel had a vast collection of museum art on display throughout. An extensive American style buffet breakfast, along with local fare, was provided as part of the room package. The hotel was located a short walk (maybe 1/3 mile) from Tianamen Square and Forbbiden City. The hotel had a gym (small but well maintained) and large indoor pool.I reserved a large, one room suite which was quite comfortable. The room had a fax machine, voicemial, internet access (although quite slow) (small addl cost), minibar, and two couches. The bathroom was very nice and included separate tub and shower areas.The hotel is located next to a large mall (not that interesting since it felt like I was in the US) but the food court was an odd mixture of fast food (DQ, Yoshinoya, KFC), a few sit down restaurants and kiosks featuring food from different areas of China. There is also a multistory bookstore that had some English language materials in its extensive collection. Behind the hotel was also a good size shopping district having a number of food kiosks, small gadget stores, larger department stores, restaurants, name brand stores, and even a pharmacy. My stay was quite short (only 3 days) but it was very centrally located and gave the chance to quickly tour the neighborhood without sacrificing time to get from one section of town to the other (traffic can be horrendeous but no worse than most metropolitian cities like San Francisco or New York).Note the airport is pretty far from this district and cab fares can vary greatly. Have heard of quotes between 500CNY (for un-informed tourists) down to 100CNY (for locals that negotiate hard).
