Dear Amina, Just wanted to write to let you know about our experience at the Champs Elysee Plaza (CEP, for short). First off, thnx for changing our room for us. I know that having a removable shower head may be a small thing for people, but it was very important for my wife. Your attention to this detail when we checked in was exemplary. This pretty much set up the whole trip for us- it was tantamount to hitting a home run in terms of service. All of your staff were kind, courteous and pleasant. Breakfast was the best meal of the day, and I must have had 15 servings of yoghurt over our stay- that stuff is addictive! Internet worked without a hitch and there were no problems with any of the equipment in our room. Turn down chocolate was excellent and the home made caramel was great. We had requested some more, but I guess you ran out as we didn\u2019t end up getting any after the first night. (This stuff was so good, that my wife would eat it instead of desert at the restaurants- or, alternatively, order desert, not eat that, and eat the chocolate instead.) A couple of minor points: -it seemed that there was an odor coming from the shower stall at certain times during the day- I assume that this was because of the sewers and it wasn\u2019t that bad- the natural fragrance helped -would have liked a little more attention to cleaning the bathroom and Jacuzzi- but no real complaints, just that we had expected it to be spotless (it was still very clean though) -walls are a bit thin, could hear people walking around in the room above us, maybe more soundproofing would be preferable if it is possible. I know that CEP is a different type of hotel (more boutique than anything else) so keeping that in mind, I thought we had a very pleasant stay. However, although everyone was pleasant and helpful, my view was that it would have averaged about a four star stay given our experience at other places. That being said, I would rate this a five star b/c that extra help in getting us the room with the detachable shower head is worth an extra star in my opinion. Accordingly, plz pass along to your management that it was b/c of your efforts that our stay was so memorable and, if it hadn\u2019t been for you coming out to meet us and helping us with the room change, it would have merely been an above average stay. Believe me when I say this, in that because of the level of service to which we are accustomed, the very little/minor things really do count and set certain establishments apart from others. In this case, I am really happy to say that it was your assistance that really made this trip memorable. Thnx again.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cChamps Elysees delight!\u201d", "Author": "lizard126", "ReviewID": "UR118172786", "Content": "Lovely boutique hotel located on a quaint quiet rue off Champs Elysees.

Rooms - very home style with big windows, beautiful curtains and new furniture. dvd player, plazma TV, tea/coffe maker, and 3 (!!!) pairs of slippers and 3 (!!!) bathrobes, etc. Bathroom is the biggest I experienced in Paris with separate toilet room, jakuzzi and separate shower. And the most important - CLEANNESS. Everything is clean. Bedclothes, carpet, chairs, etc. For us cleanness of room is the main point as we have a small child and kids easily catch infections and being sick with the baby is the worst what can happen when travelling. And the last but very important 4. Staff - professional from A to Z. We had a very quick check-in, personnel is very polite and any reasonable request was satisfied.

The receptionist was friendly and helpful, our room was spacious and tastefully decorated. The bathroom was huge and toiletries gorgeous - great shower and bath. Flat screen tv with several english channels, wonderful bed and pillows and perfect, quiet air conditioning. Our only 'moan' was that there was no tea/coffee facilities in the room which had been advertised. When we rang reception, we were told they had none to spare but we could use room service instead free of charge. Not quite as convenient as making your own tea/coffee but within minutes of ordering our drinks arrived - very impressive. The location is superb. From the peacefulness of the hotel, within 5 minutes you're in the hustle and bustle of the champs elysees. We asked the receptionist to book a restaurant for us and he couldn't have been more helpful. His recommendation was fantastic and we had a fabulous dinner. Breakfast wasn't included so I can't comment as we walked to the champs elysees for coffee and croissants which were yummy!

Very polished service, and they made some wonderful suggestions for restaurants and even made the reservations. The housekeeping staff made up the room as soon as we left for the day, and the turndown service included some gourmet chocolates every night - and it was very much appreciated. We originally booked a regular room, since a 5 star was a bit of a splurge for us, but my husband was concerned about rooms size, so we e-mailed the hotel from Rome and upgraded to a suite. It was pricey, but I feel we got our money's worth and it was a special way to end our 4 week vacation in Europe. Room was nicely decorated, with a sound system, flat screen tv, sitting area (hello purple velvet sofa, very cool), comfy bed. Bathroom was by far the best we had in any hotel Europe, and we only stayed in 5 star hotels. One reviewer was angry about the view, but he was wrong. We would have had a view from the bathroom (but for the privacy screen), and then our bedroom/lving room was of a white wall. Which, after one night, was great, since the bathroom-facing view was really noisy! We just shut the bathroom door at night, and enjoyed the zen quiet of the white wall! We didn't have the hotel breakfast, since there are so many cafes within walking distance. We walked for hours every day, and enjoyed every minute of it.

Infact one of the reception staff when we complained admitted that this was not a \"5 star palace - with those services\". So after writing this note I await the attack-like response from the management as seen on the other non-complimentary reviews. In Summary (for more detail read on) Small Boutique Hotel - not a 5 star hotel. Room Service Food - Terrible !! Courtyard Rooms - beware they face a very close-by white wall. Staff- Very Nice Service Attitude - Good until you complain ! Restaurant - What restaurant? We booked the hotel after checking out their website and reading these reviews. What we didn't pick up on, is this really is a boutique hotel and does not offer the service of a real 5 star hotel. We have stayed in some wonderful 5 star hotels around the world and this is not one. This was our honeymoon and we let the hotel know beforehand - we arrived late 9.30pm and were given our room key. Where to start...Let's start with the room... Yes it was reasonably large for a room but not for a Junior suite. The bathroom was lovely but the whirlpool bath was so uncomfortable with little jet bumps right across the back, bottom and sides - completely useless for relaxing. Hermes toiletries - v.nice we thought - but they were so highly perfumed and astringent that we both suffered minor issues. So if visiting and you have even the slightest care for your skin take your own milder toiletries. Having said that this is not the management fault... the toiletries are just very strong. Our room was quiet - very quiet almost not part of a big city. This is because it overlooked the courtyard. But not really - in fact our two tall lovely windows just faced a very high white wall. Our view of Paris from this 5 star hotel was a white wall !! All we needed were bars across the window to give it a true prison like view. So back to the courtyard. Our expectation of the courtyard is an area of land where one can sit. Nope, it is just a small area above a lower ground floor room surrounded by four walls - we are not even sure you can get out to it. The room was actually v.nicely appointed and very well furnished - but it was dark - the problem was it had dark furnishings and with windows facing the nearby white wall it just didn't get enough light. Our mistake was to wait too long to complain - so by the time we did and got offered a smaller room on the street side - we had lost the will to change. Our mistake. The bed was very large but not overly comfortable. There are some teabgs and a Nespresso coffee machine in the room but beware you will be charged 4 euros for each teabag used... and they are not even very nice teabags. If I was ordering room service for a lovely cup of tea - then yes I'd expect a charge but not for teabags in the room !! Cheap approach for a 5 star hotel more like a travelodge... And so to the room service... as I mentioned we arrived late... at 9.45pm phoned for the room service which was advertised up until 10.30pm... we were told that the chef had gone and that the limited menu was the only one available 5 or 6 dishes. We received the two huge plates of tasteless smoked salmon... very poor. 2 nights later after a long day of sight seeing, we thought we'd give the room service another go... mistake 2... tasteless and tiny... fish cassoulet and lamb curry - no flavour at all, as my wife rightly said this is France they are supposed to be able to cook aren't they, we ordered green beans but on delivery wer told they didn't have any and they had made other mixed vegetables.. what we got was a a tiny amount of lettuce. 5 star - non.. they asked us to call down to collect the tray.. when we did this they said - 'oh just leave it outside'... it was there all night... after some debate with the management we managed to get the two dishes credited. Not 5 star service.. I will at this point say the staff are mostly very friendly and I had a nice conversation with male cleaner about Paris. And even at the end of our stay the manager was very nice. But don't complain they just did not like it and are very defensive... they would do so much better to try harder to rectify a problem and not question guests ... they will gain far more loyalty. They did recommend an excellent restaurant for our final night. And so in summary as above... don't expect 5 star quality... expect a well serviced boutique hotel.", "Date": "June 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "FL", "Title": "\u201cThe Champs Elysees Plaza lived up to it's excellent reviews!\u201d", "Author": "Traveler16Fl", "ReviewID": "UR66804973", "Content": "We stayed at the Champs Elysees Plaza for 3 nights in May of 2010.

The service was very attentive and friendly, and made the stay even better. Initially we were shown to a room which did not have an extra bed, but this was rectified very quickly without fuss. The only drawback to our stay were the prices in Paris. The hotel charges \u00a318 for a gin and tonic at the bar - eyewatering ! Although the prices in Paris at present do generally take your breath away with the poor exchange rate. We booked an excursion on the same Eurostar package, which was an hour and a half coach tour, a river tour, and then lunch in the Eiffel Tower restaurant. Again very good value when booked in advance, and no need to queue at the Eiffel Tower which saves an hour or so. The lunch was more like a canteen than a restuarant, but a worthwhile experience. We had an evening meal at the Renault showroom on the Champs Elysees. A quirky experience for any car lovers amoungst you. The showroom is just 10 minutes walk from the hotel, so no need for taxis.

I booked the hotel after the reviews on Tripadvisor taking into account location, cost and opinions of previous travellers to the hotel. We travelled out on the Eurostar and all went very smoothly. The hotel is in a great location a couple of minutes from the Champs Elysees the Arc de Triomphe end. Two rooms were ready out of the three when we arrived. I had booked junior suites. Two were on the second floor and one on the 6th. Room 24 is the most airy and light although the couple staying in that room said that it was noisy at night. We stayed on the 6th floor. The bed was a good size, the jacuzzi bath fantastic, the view was however disappointing - a wall. All the rooms were nicely decorated and a good size. All staff were extremely welcoming, unobtrusive and efficient. Breakfast was adequate especially if you arrived by nine otherwise things did run out and there was a wait (this did not apply to us). I would not recommend the hotel if you want a hotel restaurant and no one seemed to use the bar. However, there are so many restaurants, bistros and brasseries around that it would seem a shame to stay at the hotel. There is an English pub on the opposite side of the road to the hotel and about a one minute walk away if you like that kind of thing. The previous year we had stayed at Hotel Tremoille, I preferred that location on the other side of the Champs Elysees and its rooms were similar in size. The area around Tremoille also has a great selection of French bistros and indeed we ate at two restaurants we had eaten at previously. Chez Andre was bustling in the evening and you must book at weekends. We ate at another bistro around the same area at lunch time (can't remember the name though) and the restaurant manager remembered us from the year before. We revisited the Latin Quarter after a 24 year gap and ate in an extremely busy restaurant serving typical french bistro food. Paris is expensive this time round because of the exchange rate and a pint of beer seemed to range from \u00a37 to \u00a328 per pint!

Breakfast was brought to the room every morning , exactly on time - Each day by a different person, but always with a very friendly attitude. This was typical of all the staff, always smiling, helping with directions & suggestions on where to go out and where to eat. Some reviewers have mentioned the elevator - Yes, it's small - tiny in fact ; but it's very quiet :) There wasn't a single negative thing to taint our stay at this hotel. I would stay there again when I'm in Paris.", "Date": "April 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gold Coast, Australia", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Paris hotel - made our trip\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4987241", "Content": "Loved this hotel - the service was fantastic, the rooms authentic and the location was perfect. We booked on a last minute site and had a problem with our reservation when we arrived - the hotel did not have a record of our booking. However the staff could not have been more accommodating - free breakfast, champagne, an alternate room and some of the best service we received in Europe. Our room on the 6th floor was perfectly suitable - from one window we could see the Eiffel Tower, from the other we could see Sacre Coeur. A quick step up to the Champs Elysees, comfy bed, enormous claw-foot bath all made this a haven for us in Paris. Would definitely recommend, and would absolutely stay there again.", "Date": "April 19, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Champs Elysees Plaza Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d270546-Reviews-Champs_Elysees_Plaza_Hotel-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$516 - $1,34", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">35 rue de Berri</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">8th Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75008</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514802", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/8b/f2/8bf2824ac4ae189a18a18d1541bed30d1large.jpg"}}
