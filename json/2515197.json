The breakfasts were a feast, and comprised a great variety of foods which kept us going for hours- a great advantage in a city so expensive to eat out in. My small criticism would be that the room was rather warm at night, but to be fair, I did not mention it at the time to the staff, who I'm sure would have been helpful and keen to check the air conditioning: they were very approachable and considerate. It made little difference to our sleep, as we were extremely tired from all the walking! I would have no hesitation in returning here, and would recommend it to anyone.

Its location right next to the M\u00e9tro station \"Ch\u00e2telet\", and a short walk to the Louvre, makes it a great starting point for visiting Paris. Our room was tiny. We had a double bed plus a sofa bed for our son, which means there was barely space to walk left in the room. Everything was clean and furnished efficiently, to make the most use of the limited space. The bathroom was right next to one side of the double bed, it consisted of a tub, a shower stall and a sink. The toilet was in a separate room right next to the entry door. There was also a small \"coffee station\" opposite the toilet room: a Nespresso coffee machine, an electric water kettle, and a few Nespresso capsules as well as the necessary fixings for making a cup of tea. The minibar was placed under the coffee station, above the safe. I've read the recent reviews of this hotel, and see that some guests have complained of lumpy pillows - yes, that must be a valid complaint because our pillows were lumpy and uncomfortable as well. I think the filling consisted of small pieces of foam. A bit of a contrast to the nice and fluffy bath towels. Usually in hotels you will find thin, cheap looking towels and nice plump pillows. Here it was the other way round. Another reviewer complained of overheated room - that was the case with our room as well. We turned off the heating immediately upon arrival but the room remained too warm and stuffy. We resorted to sleeping with the window open (in March!) just to cool off a little and get some fresh air, which was not an ideal solution because there was a lot of noise from the street (ambulances, drunk people yelling at each other, traffic). One last gripe: in my booking, I requested a non smoking room. We were put in a SMOKING room, and only later realized, the whole FLOOR was a smoking floor (which explains the smell). So, beware, the 3rd floor is full of smoking rooms and if you are, as we are, non smokers, request a room on a different floor. Breakfast was served in the hotel restaurant. I don't know if what we experienced was a regular occurrence or a fluke, but on both mornings, there was a long line of hotel guests waiting to be seated before they could have their breakfast. The breakfast receptionist was clearly overwhelmed by the amounts of guests waiting. She definitely did her best, no complaints there, but it was obvious that the restaurant capacity was nowhere near enough. We arrived at breakfast at 9 AM and by 10 AM people were still queueing to be seated. The otherwise boring wait was somewhat alleviated by the presence of an entertainer, who tried his best to cheer little kids up by making balloon animals for them. The man was very nice and his balloon animals were a hit with our son. But the hotel management needs to address the issue of not having enough seats/tables for their guests. The breakfast itself was nice, there was plenty of food to choose from, both sweet and savoury to hot and cold. Another good point: the children's play area. There are some toys and two TV screens with game consoles for the kids. All in all, this is a nice enough hotel and we'd consider staying here again, on the condition that 1) we get a room on a non smoking floor, 2) the heating/airconditioning is fixed, 3) the pillows are upgraded.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels", "Title": "\u201cnot a good start\u201d", "Author": "bruno1234Brussels", "ReviewID": "UR125500075", "Content": "booked and paid my room months ago because I really need to stay here ,as I am running a seminar at the hotel.... got a phone call the day before scheduled arrival asking if I would mind changing hotels because the rooms are undergoing renovations... incredible!as if renovations and number of avaible rooms are not planned beforehand... obviously refused as the seminar as at this same hotel and there is no other hotel of good standards which is so central... jezus, really ,why would I book months ahead if I didn't mind staying at another place... curious what will happen tomorrow...I'll get back to Tripadvisor, positive or negative...", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midlands", "Title": "\u201cVery Central Location\u201d", "Author": "crafted755", "ReviewID": "UR124976905", "Content": "My husband booked this hotel/ Paris break as a surprise for my birthday as it was our first time in Paris.

I chose Novotel because though I did not stay there the year before, I was impressed with the facility and vowed that I would one day stay there.The Novotel staff was very friendly and accommodating and helped us with our transition; we were also able to communication effectively with the staff.

There is also immediate access to the bike rentals right outside the front entrance. Our room was spacious, had air conditioning, was clean, well maintained, had a good view, was right next to the ice machine and more importantly we felt safe. There was cable television and internet access which was greatly appreciated. It provided a perfect place to relax after a day filled with walking an exploring. My children had no problem exploring on their own and walking around the plaza at the Fountain of the Innocents and the surrounding area without concern. The grounds are well maintained and the lobby and patio area are beautiful. The price was higher than I would have preferred, though not outrageous; but after the apartment fiasco I learned you get what you pay for. Luckily I was able to get my money refunded from the apartment. Upon our departure the staff also helped us secure a taxi to CDG (didn't want to do the RER again). I am very happy with our decision to stay at Novotel and will do so again on our next visit. My children found the trip to be very rewarding and have vigorously resumed their French studies.

We opted for the 'grown up area' on the last morning - much better and good value. The restaurant didn't have a great choice in the evening (and very costly) and shame the bar didn't have a separate snack menu.

However, Novotel chain (belonging to Accor) has a few of their family hotels in Paris, and this one is the most centrally located, and it's really good in terms of value for money, especially when you book early. We travelled two families with 4 children. We got to the hotel in the noon, but our rooms were not ready so we left our luggage in the storage room and went on a promenade to have a look around and a lunch, too. When we were back at around 03.00 PM, the rooms were ready, as promised. Also, the staff were very helpful and attentive -- they gave us four or five umbrellas upon request, as it was raining; every time asked they provided detailed instructions about getting around the city, as this was our first time in Paris; and explained in good detail everything we asked about their cuisine during dinner, as we had our lunches out in the city. We had our breakfasts at the hotel -- buffet with good selection, free for 2 children under 16 staying with their parents. It's a very nice touch to serve breakfasts for families in a separate room with two enormous TV screens and a clown making balloon swords and animals for children as well as a magician showing hocus-pocuses. Above of that, children got wooden yoyos and some other small stuff like color pencils etc. As to two X-Boxes in the lobby next to the restrooms and another one next to the dining room we had our breakfasts at, it's common for all Novotel hotels, at least for those we stayed at during our two-week trip across France and Italy, and is a nice touch, too. A plus is that the hotel is located right next to a big Parisian subway hub with many metro lines and RER (railway to various destinations including Disneyland) and it's a very convenient way to get almost everywhere in Paris.

Its just like every other Novotel in France in terms of rooms, nice and clean, not luxury but comfortable and welcoming. Little touches like the espresso machine in the rooms make a difference. The thing is, you always know exactly what you are getting with a Novotel and the prices are not cheap but they are in line with other hotels in the area which are much more hit and miss. The location is great because you can walk to plenty of Parisien attractions in a few minutes. The Pompidou centre is just 2 mins away. The bars, cafes, shops and restaurants of the Marais are another five to ten minutes beyond there. You can easily walk in other directions to Le Louvre, to the Ile de la Cite (for Notre Dame), and so on. You can even walk across the park and go the Sunday morning street market just 5 mins away, where you'll be able to mingle with real Parisiens buying their fresh bread, veg, meat, fish, flowers, etc, or have a coffee in a cafe and watch them all as they go past. The main downsides of the hotel are that breakfast can be a nightmare if the hotel is busy. Plus there is work going on in Les Halles to totally renovate the area so if you have a view from your window it might include a building site (not a messy one, but not exactly the romantic Paris view you imagined!) We've always the found the staff to be helpful, but you have to ask, their not exactly forthcoming with the help if you sit quietly at breakfast or don't ask at check in. We have been upgraded to a Junior Suite in the past and loved the room but havent booked one since. You;re in Paris for god's sake, so who wants to sit in a slightly larger room with nicer features, when you could be outside a cafe, sipping a glass of wine and watching teh world go by? Save yiour money and go for the superior room if you want a nice room, that's got enough space for two and a nice bed. The bathrooms in Novotel are somewhat eclectic, you'll either love them or hate them, but they are the same design in each Novotel room we've stayed in in France. Funny moulded pastic sinks and shower doors that open into the middle of the bathroom (thus dripping water all over the slippery floor tiles every time you use the shower). But we've learned to cope with those things as the location is great, the beds are very good for the price range and the hotel is easy, relaxed and yet still on the right side of sophisticated. What prompted me to write this review is that I've just booked my next stay at this hotel, for my birthday in December, because I looked on various websites (booking.com, Tripadvisor, etc) and this is still the best hotel for the price range back to which I can walk (or rather, stagger) after a night out in the Marais", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cThe website said it is the most central hotel in Paris - and it is!\u201d", "Author": "Tavare", "ReviewID": "UR119019760", "Content": "The Novotel's website claimed it was paris' most centrally located hotel, and after three nights staying with our two children, you had to agree.

The hotel is surrounded by hundreds of restaurants, with Hippopotamus being the best choice for kids (they also do some very good meat dishes). The four of us shared a room which came with a queen bed and two convertible single sofas, so it was more than adequate, especially as the children ate free as part of the Novotel package. Unfortunately the Les Halles area is under serious renovation so the usually wide-open spaces were blocked off, but as we spent much of the time at places like the Louvre, Eiffel Tower and Montmartre it wasn't much of an issue. Service was very friendly, and they even politely put up with my bad French. Paris isn't all that child friendly, so finding the right hotel is very important.

On the plus side, one can walk to most of the most famous sites. Those not inclined to walk are well served by the nearby Chatelet Metro station. There are many restaurants and shops of all kinds. But there is construction that will last several more years -- the rebuilding of the Forum Les Halles, which causes limited car access to the hotel entrance. Access is available, but rerouted enough to make a taxi ride a bit more expensive at any time when there is traffic. The room we had faced the central courtyard and we heard no construction. The immediate area is a bit seedier than in previous years, and local friends advised not going more than a few streets north of Les Halles any more. On the other hand, the Marais is a short walk in another direction, and 5 minutes south brings one to the Left Bank and its myriad restaurants. All rooms apparently have queen beds, and the \"executive\" room we booked had a fold-out couch for our teen. Quarters were cramped but doable. Nice bathroom, and bathrobes. Coffee machine made good expresso, but we had to remind the staff to replace the coffee pods, and we ended up washing out our cups daily. There was also supposed to be a water bottle daily, but there was not. Tap water is fine, though on the 90 degree day we arrived, having had a bottle to go walking with would have saved a euro or two [daily]. Kids also stay free in their parents' rooms, and the hotel was full of families. We took advantage of an offer to pay in advance for a significantly reduced room rate. We share other TripAdvisor reviews' advice: skip the overpriced buffet breakfast (18 euro per adult, children free). Many nearby caf\u00e9s offer more standard French fare (coffee and bread or croissant) as well as American breakfasts at much better prices. Similarly, dinner was uninspiring and pricey both \u00e0 la carte and buffet (25 euros). We ate in just once after an exhausting day, but would have done much better steps away.

There was a staff member on the front desk -- let's call her Blondie with Black euro glasses -- who was older and should have been more mature than the others. When i called the front desk (maid service was not an option on the phone) to ask for my in-room coffee to be replenished (they failed to do it earlier in the day), she first asked if i spoke any language besides English (she asked in English). when i told her what i wanted in French, she laughed hysterically and essentially told me that was not her job (in English again). i mean she laughed, and laughed, and laughed. started talking to other people around her. when i asked who i should call, she hung up. i reported her to the manager, who was kind enough to offer an apology, but i don't think he truly understood how humiliating and upsetting her attitude was to me. Then, the next day, i go to pick up my rental car to check out. there is a lot of construction going on in the area, but i made my way back to the hotel where i was confronted with a sign to the narrow parking lot driveway in front that was marked \"entry forbidden.\" so i thought I'd missed the entrance and was looking at the exit. i parked the car out of the way to go inside and ask the front desk where to park while i gathered my luggage. before i could enter, Blondie with her black euro glasses comes running out SCREAMING that i could not park there. I said very calmly that i was just walking inside to find out where i should park, and her response was basically unintelligible, other than 'you can't park there' and she turned her back to me and went inside. Another gentleman politely told me that i could indeed use the entrance there. when i returned to check out, Blondie gave me a big smile, did not recognize me at all, or she is simply bipolar, and asked if she could help me. i stayed away. i was leaving so did not report this to the management again. she ruined an otherwise decent stay. The only other negative is that they do a lousy job replenishing the coffee service or supplying coffee mugs. also, note that the wired internet does not cost anything, but most of the staff won't tell you that. Good. i was not put off by the construction at Les Halles. no noise on my side. Room was fine except for the funky standalone toilet room separated from the sink and bathroom, noted by others. The bed was comfortable as was my 14 y.o. sleep sofa. The front desk staff was always polite and most were friendly -- except Blondie. some were a little more knowledgeable and friendly than others, but they always tried to help. the lady in the tourist office off the lobby was very helpful and friendly. Food was fine, though a bit expensive. Neighborhood was great. We asked for dinner recommendations of several staff members but it wasn't until the last night that we realized the best area was not between the hotel and the Seine, but the opposite direction. there are a ton of restaurants there. stay away from the touristy ones in the square toward Seine, although we did like the nearby Beirut Cafe. Great metro access although the exits can get very confusing. It is an easy walk to many great sites, especially the Louvre and Notre Dame. I'd probably return some day were it not for the bad experience with Blondie. with her, it seemed to higlight a few of the shortcomings of the hotel. it is fine, but nothing special.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cHORRIBLE EXPERIENCE, WILL NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE\u201d", "Author": "belle_henry", "ReviewID": "UR114706871", "Content": "We stayed here on 2 separate ocassions as we're travelling around Europe so we spent the first 3 days of our 15 days trip and returned again on the 14th day to catch our plane back to Singapore.

All in all, the this is a good hotel. However, I ran into two major annoyances while staying here. 1. No ironing boards available in the hotel. There are no ironing boards in the rooms and when I woke up to prepare for work I called the front desk to have one delivered and found that there are only 12 ironing boards for the entire 285-room hotel. I was told 3 days ago that one would be delivered to my room as soon as it became available. Still waiting... 12 ironing boards for 285 rooms?! Who decided that was adequate?! 2. The housekeeping staff ignores your do not disturb signs. My schedule called for later nights which resulted in daytime sleep. Every morning the housekeeping staff ignored my DND sign, knocked and opened my door for cleaning until I told them \"no thank you\". I called the front desk who said that they would inform housekeeping to honor the do not disturb sign but housekeeping disregarded the sign and woke me every day of my stay. With this policy why do they bother providing the DND signs to their guests? Here's the good stuff: 1. Room was available for early check-in 2. Front desk service is efficient and friendly 3. Wired internet is free, fast and reliable 4. 18 Euro breakfast is good, not great, but can be considered a good value given the relative prices in Paris 5. Location, location, location. You can't beat the access to the Chatalet-Les Halles Metro and RER stations Other stuff: There is a major rehab of the Forum Des Halles which is the shopping center next to to the Novotel. I would guess that about 1/3 of the Novotel's rooms face the construction site. So, you only have a ~30% chance of getting a room that is effected by construction noise. There is definitely construction noise but not enough to keep me awake while I slept during the day. However, if you are a light sleeper or if you plan to be in your room during the day you may want to avoid this hotel until the project is complete. Judging from the scale of construction I would guess that the construction will be going on for at six months to a year (check pics). In my opinion the other reviewers may have overstated the noise level.

It has 3 metro stations within a few minutes walk of the hotel (one which is outside the front door) and this gave you lots of options for easy travel around Paris. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was comfortable, clean and very quiet - i had a room facing the hotel courtyard and it was really peaceful. It has windows which actually open and it was lovely to open up the window for some fresh air and warm sunshine. Another bonus was the easy access from CDG airport - direct RER train service to Chatelle Les Halles (2 mins from hotel) with NO steps at either end ! (great when you have a heavy bag to carry on the way home!!)

I'm not sure where to begin... First - when we arrived - I had to use the woman's room in the lobby and it was FILTHY. 2 of the toilettes were backed up and it looked as though it hadn't been cleaned in days. But I also figured it was a Sunday so maybe the cleaning staff hadn't cleaned it over the weekend. But then we got to our room.... what a ridiculous configuration! There is a stand alone toilette as you walk in. I found it very strange to use a toilette in one little room without a sink to wash your hands and then have to walk around into your actual sleeping area to use the rest of the bathroom. The bed was like a futon mattress. It was miserable as were the pillows. The shower head was broken in the shower and hence flooded our entire bathroom. We had also specifically requested when we made our reservation a non-smoking room and we didn't get that. When I tried to switch they were completely booked. I should point out that paris was experiencing a heat wave the day we arrived but I would think a hotel like the Novotel would be able to produce working air conditioning. They could not and the only reason they gave was the unseasonably hot weather. I know it's Europe - I get the whole air conditioning thing in Europe - but it was a sauna in our room! We had to sleep with our windows completely wide open which wasn't the most comfortable with a 3 year old in the room. We did get the crib we requested - it was a portable crib which was fine but it had holes in the sides of it. Nothing special. Our room faced the courtyard area in the middle of the hotel which was loud at night with people having drinks. Would not be an issue if the air conditioning worked. I will say that over all the staff were very friendly and the short walk to Notre Dame was lovely.

The size was good,, it was clean and had everlything one need for a 2 night stay (including free wifi). The only downside was that our room overlooked the breakfast area and was inside the Atrium so we couldn't open our window. The first night was not so comfortable, the ariconditioning didn't work it blew heat instead of cold air and we could't get fresh air in because the window couldn't open. We went to the reception in the morning and asked if they could have a look at the airco. We got another, even bigger room, because indeed the airco seemed to have been broken. The new room got 2 sofa beds and 1 double bed. Also a really nice bonus if you travel with friends is that the toilet is not in the bathroom but is separated which is great if you are like us with 3 ladies needing the bathroom in the morning. Yes they are building next to the hotel but our 2nd room was looking out to this and we slept the whole night with the window open and no one of us had significant issues with noise as some other reviews mention. For light sleepers in a city just a tip - earplugs will do the trick as well if it really bothers you. The location is great. Right next to the best connected metro line from Paris and within walking distance from Notre Dame, Centre Pompidou, Louvre,...

We had chosen a Deluxe room, which had a separate bathroom and loo (although with no sink in the loo, you still have to go into the bathroom to wash your hands!). The bathroom has a shower stall and a separate bath - it was nice to have the option of both.

We got the Orlyval to Anthony and then the RER B to Les Halles, this was all very easy, even though we hadn't done it before. Took us a little while to find the hotel, in the pouring rain, but eventually found it, actually not far from the station. First impressions were good and the reception greeting was polite and friendly, the staff speaking fluent English. We had a family room, which had a King size and two single beds, bathroom and separate toilet, LCD TV, mini bar and tea, coffee making facilities. The room was quite small for all four of us, but we expected this for the price we paid. As others have stated the location is excellent and we walked everywhere. Pompidou Centre is very close, as is the Louvre. Les Halles Shopping Centre was very good and literally outside the back door. We walked along the banks of the Seine and also to the Eiffel Tower. The latter was a long walk which took about 45 to 60 minutes, but enjoyable if you like walking. We also walked to the Arc de Triomphe. Breakfast at the Novotel was very good, if chaotic. A choice of pastries, fruit, cereals, cheese, cold meats and cooked food was available. It was buffet style and so there was a lot of walking up and down and backwards and forwards,trying to dodge people with hot drinks or ending up with egg on your face, but nonetheless quite a good choice I thought. Rooms were kept clean and well stocked each day and the cleaning staff helpful and polite. The correct number of towels were left each day for all 4 of us. This is one of my behmarks of a good hotel, very often not reached! The bar was very pleasant to sit in in the evenings, expensive of course, but the bar staff were always very friendly and helpful. We did eat in the bar a couple of times and enjoyed club sandwiches with fries and salad for just under 15 euros each. There was a pianist in the bar some evenings which was quite enjoyable, just background music. Around the hotel there were many restaurants and cafes we tried a couple but weren't overly impressed, there is also and MacDonalds and KFC is you're desparate, There was tourist info help in the hotel, which was very good and I found all the staff very polite and helpful. This is a city, chain hotel, so you pretty much know what you'll get. It isn't a unique French Hotel, but for me it was of a good standard, ideal for families.

I was offered breakfast at 21 euros but with cafes and patisseries nearby, why eat at the hotel? The staff was efficient even if a bit cold. I booked at the last minute and was able to get only the rack rate.

I asked for an \"outside\" room as I did not want to just look out onto the courtyard and I was given a room on the 4th floor where I could see Montmartre Basilica if I stuck my head out of the window.

The rooms were pretty much like any other Novotel but the WC was separate to the bathroom. The shower was good with a decent pressure. The buffet breakfast was pretty good but one day they ran out of bacon and did not bother restocking with more bacon even after I told them we had run out. At least they did not run out of croissants! The coffee was pretty good as a need a decent cup of black coffee to get me started. One annoyance was that the door of the next room to mine had very squeaky hinges and I told reception that it needed oiling but I don't think they understood what I was saying.

Instead of that, they phoned the airlines themselves and solved my problem for me. All of the above is positive; here's the other side. The hotel, while quite nice, is on a small cul-de-sac. We had a group of nine people and used three taxis to get to the hotel. Two of the three taxi drivers had trouble finding it. Even the GPS system in the taxi I used seemed to give inaccurate instructions. Also, there are some loud young people in front of the hotel at night and I think some in my group were worried by them.

We chose this hotel because of it's proximity to the RER/Metro and the ease of getting to/from the airport, and this really is the only thing going for it. We arrived on the train, and the exit that leads directly to the Novotel wasn't open, so we ended up having to walk through the Forum shopping mall, then weaving our way around the outside mall to find it. We found the entrance and were kind of disgusted to see about 9 Novotel employees crowding the doorway having a cigarette. We currently live in China, and absolutely everybody smokes wherever they like so this wasn't much of a surprise, but this type of behaviour from staff didn't really give a good first impression - particularly when we couldn't even manage to get our luggage through the pack of them without an effort. Check in was relatively easy, but we're sure we were re-allocated to the furthest room possible because we booked and pre-paid our accommodation on Expedia. We don't speak any French, however the girl behind was preparing our key, and a colleague of hers spoke to her then said \".......Expedia\" and shook his head. She then re-coded the key and we ended up in the very last room of the corridor, in the furthest spot from the lifts. Previous reviews mentioned that 1 of the 3 lifts wasn't operational - this is still the case, so who knows when the Novotel will actually get their act together and fix it. While we didn't have too many problems with waiting for the lift, on the occasions that we did, it was because they were completely full with staff, on their way downstairs for their cigarette break. We live in an apartment in a 5 star hotel, and we have never experienced a time when the staff take priority over the guests when trying to use the lifts - they actually get out of the lift to allow us to use it. We even experienced a time when we arrived at the lift first, then 2 maintenance people arrived with tool belts etc. The lift was quite crowded when it arrived and instead of allowing us in first, the maintenance crew barged their way through and took up the remaining space in the lift. Maybe that's the infamous French attitude..... Our room for the most part was nice enough, decent size with quite a comfortable bed but it was a very strange set up with the toilet right inside the front door, separate to the bathroom. This was convenient for when someone was in the shower, however there was no tap or washing facilities in there, so it was still necessary to interrupt whoever was using the bathroom to be able to wash your hands. The shower also, was absolutely disgusting with mould covering about 60% of it. It was blatantly obvious that the cleaners would stand on the outside of the shower and only clean as high as they could reach. As soon as you looked higher than eye level, the mould was so thick it was completely off-putting. Trying to complain about this was an experience, with housekeeping and reception \"playing dumb\" and pretending not to understand. The most bizarre thing we found though was that at midnight every night, the television service cut out. Every night at exactly the same time, the satellite connection dropped out. Every night we complained and were told that it was a technical issue that they were trying to deal with. On our last night there, another complaint was made when the tv cut out yet again and this time we were told that we must have been put in one of the \"bad rooms\", and did we went to be moved to another room. Too little, too late - why would we want to change rooms when we were 8 hours away from checking out? Every request and complaint with this hotel fell on deaf ears - from clean towels (sorry, don't have any), to the ridiculous situation with the tv (obviously they expect everyone to be asleep by midnight and don't pay for a full 24 hour satellite connection).

I asked for a \"nice\" room and the lady behind the desk did a room search and advised me that she had no good rooms available, but if I came back in an hour she would have reserved one for me. Sure enough, on our return (after a long cool drink in a nearby pavement cafe, we were given a large room overlooking the Forum Les Halles gardens, super service. I have seen some comments regarding the number of young adults who make this place a little uncomfortable at night. My wife and I (both in our 60's) had no issues at all (there were a couple of night-sleeper vagrants, but caused to problems at all). The surrounding area is brilliant for dining out or just having a drink. The usual mix of up-market restaurants, pub meals and fast-food outlets. All this and only 10 mins walk form the Seine and the best museum in the world, the Louvre. Go and take a look at the glass pyramid. We visited two of the Irish bars and were made most welcome. A meal and a Guinness is just right after a day sightseeing. We had our anniversary on the dining cruise of the Bateaux Parisienne, quite expensive at around \u00a3120 per person, buy what a meal!! For a special occasion it can't be beaten, all the food, together with wine/cocktails/aperitif + the night views of Paris. Two minor bad points with the hotel- one of the lifts was out of action all weekend which made it a queue sometimes. The other item was the breakfast , we had a deal whereby this was included in the price of the room, but if I had paid the 17 euro per person I would have been very disappointed. Take my advice, don't pay the money, it isn't worth it as there are plenty of bars within 100 meters who will do you a propoer \"full English\" for half the cost. As I have been a regular visitor to Paris, take this tip, buy a Metro Pass for the number of days you intend to be in Paris - great value at around 6 euros per day. I paid 36 euros for two people for zones 1,2 & 3. It allows you unlimited travel on the metro and the RER (up-market metro, used for the out-of-town journeys, similar to the S-Bann trains in Germany).

The rooms are clean and adequate in size and the bathrooms are very modern - I will never understand what the deal is with no shower curtains in Europe - but the shower/bathtub itself was actually quite big as well. There is really no decor to speak of, but we did have a nice view of Les Halles, overlooking a great kid's park, a carousel and beautiful church. You are close to the metro and have a couple different options for stops, Chatelet being the best one so you don't have to go through the mall to get in and out. There are many restuarants around (besides the mall) but it's just a short walk to Notre Dame and many many more options. In the evenings there are lots of teens and young adults hanging out in big groups around the area so people not used to teens and/or youth who might be classified as \"thugs\" might feel intimidated.

I was with my partner, my two nieces and their two grandmothers so we had two rooms..rooms are small and somewhat dingy (but with great brand-new flat LCD TV's), but along the back they have great views of Les Halles and a wonderful gothic church. I would not call this a four star hotel (see below), although the lobby and lobby bar look very nice. For what we were paying in central paris within walking distance practicalyl of everything I wanted to see, I thought it was excellent value for the money and would stay again. Now for the negatives: 1. The front desk!!! Message to management: HIRE SOME PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This hotel is gigantic with hundreds of rooms...now guess how many people are usually working at the front desk? Max 3 at any given time, and mostly just two; no manager in sight. It is complete anarchy and unacceptable for a hotel this size...check in takes at least 20 minutes and check out can be even worse depending on the time you choose. There is ALWAYS a line-up...if you want to call it that...people just sort of crowd around the desks as they are oval and nobody really knows how to apparoach that. Some of the staff frankly try their best, but I would imagine that the turnover of the staff is really high as it is so overwhelming that they must throw in the towel after a few months...it is really sad...BE PREPARED FOR THIS. 2. Certain front desk staff: some are angels and are only to happy to call a taxi etc. I had a horrible (and what most would call a typical rude parisian) experience with some poorly-trained estagiare who obviously thought herself above having to work at the front desk of a hotel...after an itialian family decided to make their own line-up along the front desk, I made sure that I was to be next to do my checkout. She told me that they were there first (they arrived 5 minutes after me); I told her that I was in the line long before them and that it wasn't my problem she wasn't looking behind the person she was serving (I mean, if the line up doesn't start behind the person that is currently being served, where is it to start!!??). There was this back and forth, which I find unimagineable that a counter person would engage in(and continue with). She should be fired for behaviour and disrespect like this. Arguing at the front desk of a hotel in front of 10 people?? Shameful. It ruined my whole stay. 3. Breakfast Buffet: be warned! get there early, or get there late! At 9am one morning there was a queue (at least it was being respected!) of probably 40 people and the breakfast room was packed. We ended up eating a wonderfully typical parisian breakfast at a small caf\u00e9 in the square beside the hotel out on the terrace in the sunshine, while parisians passed by on their way to work...do this at least once during your vacation, you will love it. While the wait for the buffet can be outrageously long, it is actually a good, well stocked buffet which I enjoyed. Despite the horrible woman at the front desk and the waits to check in or out, I still would stay here again for the convenience and decent price. But please, Novotel, if you read this, PLEASE hire more people for the front desk and it might be time to do a clean-up of your desk staff and a re-training in customer service, as this keeps your hotel from being considered a true 4 star...(read the rest of the reviews)", "Date": "July 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but expensive\u201d", "Author": "geds35", "ReviewID": "UR17146287", "Content": "I stayed at Novotel Les Halles for 5 nights in June a family of 2 adults and 2 children in one room.

Within minutes we were whisked away in a taxi driven by the most delightful Parisian lady to the Novotel Les Halles, - cost around 10 euros. She asked for our hotel address details and typed the area code into her GPS before heading off, so its well worth having that info handy. She was just lovely and pointed out places of interest in reasonably good English. What a great ambassador for Paris this lady was. Her friendliness set the tone for the rest of the holiday. Paris was for us a very welcoming city. Check-in at the Novotel Les Halles was a breeze. We made our best attempt at speaking in French, but the staff are all english speaking and happy to skip between any number of languages. I had been worried about arriving so late, but at least there were no queues. We signed the booking forms and surveyed the lobby and lounge area, picking up a free tourist map of Paris to peruse in our room. A pianist was tinkling the ivories as a few people enjoyed the end of a fine day with a glass of something cool from the bar. I noted that there was a tourist information office just inside the lobby with lots of attraction leaflets on display. It was very useful during our trip to be able ask advice there, although we didn't make use of the booking service. On arrival the teens were tired after our long day of travel so we left them to unpack while we set out to find some takeaway. Mcdonalds of all places was the only takeaway still open at that late hour, so Mcdonalds it had to be! There were a number of pleasant looking restaurants and bars around the fountain square at the rear of the hotel, including of all things, a Pizza Hut. No we would not be going to Pizza Hut this trip! There was a security guard on the door of Mcdonalds and I remembered what I had read on Tripadvisor about the area (Forum Les Halles) seeming threatening at night to one family. To me it seemed delightful and the fountain in the middle of the paved square provided some much needed cool air on a very hot evening. Later in the week we witnessed a few antisocial incidents in the fountain square, and a big scuffle at Mcdonalds when a guy tried to grab the contents of the till without success. Funnily enough the trouble we witnessed in the square was during the day and not at night, but didn't spoil our experience or stop us from eating at a lovely restaurant (Pizzeria Ennio) overlooking the square. We just kept our city street-smarts about us at all times. Pizza and a beer could be had for 11.90 euros. Pizzas were cooked in a traditional brick oven and tasted wonderful. The room was decent enough at around 345 euros a night. I thought from the booking details that we\u2019d have two double beds and two single sofabeds in one big room. What we actually got was a separate double bedroom with triple glazed windows and flat screen TV, and a sitting room/dining area with one double sofabed, and two single sofabeds, an even bigger flat screen TV and a big dining table and chairs. The double bed was amazingly comfortable but the sofabeds were not so great. We all fell in love with the huge walk-in shower with giant shower-head. Weirdly the loo (in its own room) didn\u2019t have a sink or a door lock. The shower room had no door lock either. At times we sat around patiently waiting to wash our hands while others lingered and luxuriated in the shower. Oh well, when in France\u2026.. At least the room was clean and well set out, with a lovely little Paris Balcony whose doors were almost permanently open so we could watch the world go by at the front of the hotel. There was no bother with noise at night and we slept like babies despite the hot weather and AC that sometimes struggled a little. The Novotel's proximity to so many lovely areas and attractions was a big bonus (Pompidou Centre, Notre Dame Cathedral, St Germaine, the Louvre, Rue Rivoli) and we did not need to use the metro even once. At 17 euros per person we were never going to have the breakfast, but enjoyed setting out each day to discover the patisseries and cafes on the doorstep. There were plenty of cafe's to choose from plus a couple of grocery stores that came in handy for topping up on sodas, juice and water. The little Monop/Monoprix opposite the Pompidou Centre was a great find for snacks, salads, sandwiches and essentials, but more importantly in such a heatwave, it had brilliant air conditioning! There was also a small grocery store across the road from the hotel which sold individual bottles of chilled soda at 2 euros each, and large bottles of unchilled water also for 2 euros. There was a minibar in the room with tiny bottles of evian water for 4 euros - does anyone seriously use these ridiculous minibars? We would have liked use of a fridge, but didn't dare make use of the minibar for chilling. The staff at reception were great and helped us on a number of occasions with useful advice and also booked our taxi for the return to Gare du Nord on the last day. This time the taxi cost just over 20 euros - twice as much, even though at that time of day the streets were empty and the journey relatively quick. Perhaps it was because we booked through the hotel, but it was much easier than booking it ourselves, so no matter. Check-out was quick and easy and the bill was absolutely spot on. We had booked directly with Novotel and had not used the bar or restaurant during our stay, so there were no additional charges. Apart from the taxi to and from the hotel, the only mode of transport we used during our stay was the batobus - a hop-on hop-off waterbus that cost 12 euros per person per day, or 6 and 8 euros for students and children. There was no commentary on the boat, but the views were brilliant and the crew were a cheery and helpful bunch dispensing travel advice in an impressive selection of languages. The nearest Batobus stops to the hotel were Notre Dame Cathedral and the Louvre - both places a gentle twenty minute stroll from Les Halles. They have a website so you can check the itinerary. We used it to head up the Seine to the Eiffel Tower. All in all a great venue for a first visit to Paris. I would definitely consider staying at Novotel Les Halles again, though next time I quite fancy staying on the left bank as it was so attractive. It's worth noting that Citadines Les Halles was in the same building as the Novotel, though I have no idea what its like inside. ps one of the three lifts was still out of action at the hotel, but hopefully it will be remedied soon.

However, that is all on the \u2018plus\u2019 side. The hotel itself lets its great location down by the bucket load. For some unknown reason, The Novotel Paris Les Halles chooses to describe itself as one of a few Novotel\u2019s in France that has been awarded four stars. There is an air of grubbiness as soon as you approach the forecourt of the hotel. That goes with the general location of the area but still no reason why no general maintenance or daily wash down is not carried out. Once inside the hotel the lobby and public areas look well maintained but it is the sometimes lack of staffing to greet and meet that makes it look unmanaged. Multi tasking may be the name of the game nowadays but there is no obvious discipline as to which member of staff is supposed to be doing what; check in, check out, enquiries, concierge etc? The three tiny lifts are slow and totally impractical for the size of the hotel and for \u2018added\u2019 security also require the guest to swipe the room card to call the lift. But in typically French fashion whilst this may deter most undesirables off the street from gaining access to the upper floors, they can still sneak in when a lift arrives and its passengers get out. The floor corridors smell of goodness knows what and even our non smoking room had obviously had smokers using them. Has the hotel never heard of using air fresheners to at least mask those smells? The rooms are of reasonable size and in fairly good condition with the exception of our last room where the wooden skirting was brown with damp that was leaking through from the shower behind it. The air conditioner was not working in that it could only push out warm air. The toilet was badly lit and lacked good ventilation. Bathroom was in good order but suffered from bad plumbing which meant when you emptied the hand basin the waste strainer in the shower tray was forced out. This with the added bonus of having old sludge blowing back through the shower tray was gross! We had to remember that any wake up calls we booked with reception had to be timed for 15 minutes ahead of your actual requirement as the system (even though it was reported) was still running 15 minutes late on our last day The bar area is comfortable if small for the number of rooms but okay for a quick drink. The breakfasts even though it was not taken on this last visit, are in my opinion, overpriced, sometimes chaotic (room not big enough for size hotel perhaps?) and under managed and better to avoid as there is a very nice Paul\u2019s boulangerie around the corner where you can get a continental breakfast for half the price of the 17 euros that the Novotel does. By the way, its 15.30 euros at the Novotel down by the Eiffel Tower. The Novotel Paris Les Halles is obviously for one or two night tour operators and conventions which looks like the mainstay of this particular hotel's business and the independent traveller is probably better off finding somewhere else for their stay in Paris. At best it is a three star hotel masquerading to be a four star and it is as another reviewer, suggests, worth avoiding like the plague especially for what they are charging.

The hotel lacks any soul, has terrible smells emanating from who knows where. Although it's billed as a 4-Star hotel it is probably a 3-Star at best. No concierge either? And no porter to assist with luggage? The only redeeming feature of this hotel is its position. Close to the Louvre and Metro, thanks goodness we spent most our time sightseeing. The local area is a bit seedy too. We felt a little scared coming back in the early evening and walking from the Metro to the hotel, only a few minutes walk.

Location The location is fine, with minutes from Paris Les Halles, Centre Pompidou and La Cite. Rooms & Amenities The rooms are in desperate need of an overhaul; it seems that apart from the lobby area, the hotel was renovated in the early nineties. The carpets and beds are threadbare, the bathrooms old and scuffed, the TVs small, the whole place feels neglected. There are a bar and a restaurant also, and a reasonably nice lounge area. Breakfast Breakfast has a poor choice, and unless you come very early, you are likely to wait for 20minutes to be given a table, as there are not enough tables to service more than a third of the residents and there seem to be no staff around to clear used tables. Service staff seem helpless and confused, half the tea/coffee machines are usually out of order. Service and staff Check-in and check-out are okay; on checking out, we were given our room as a day-room at not extra charge. Concierge is great, very helpful and knowledgeable.

However, just ahead of my last trip, I changed my reservation to Novotel, because I learned from Tripadvisor that the hotel that I had initially booked had its reception a flight of stairs up and also had had problems with their elevators. My travel companion had (fortunately temporary) reduced mobility and we didn\u2019t want to risk anything. A Novotel for me is a no-glamour but a no-surprise experience, and that\u2019s why it can be worth to pay a premium compared to other hotels of the same class. First surprise, at 12.30, only two persons in this 300 room hotel were working to handle the enormous queues of hotel guests checking in and out, including the baggage storage room quite far away. After a half-an-hour\u2019s wait, I got the message, like the guests before me, that the room would not be available until 3pm, as was officially stated. The advantage of a big hotel is usually that they can handle the flux of hotel guests coming in and out without sticking to official rules. Second surprise, the nice French windows that all the rooms seem to have were lacking in our room, being placed in a middle section, with only a small window which was not possible to open. (The congested bathroom sink was actually no surprise at all, having stayed in so many Paris hotels of all classes). At this point of the day, we hadn\u2019t had the real surprise yet, since elevators were quite busy, taking people down all the time, so we didn\u2019t get aware of the problem that was announced on a piece of paper, namely that the mechanism for calling the elevator with the hotel card was out of order. We learned that from a surly night receptionist, who asked us to walk up the stairs o the first floor to call the elevator, increasing his voice and switching to English, when we stood there hesitant how to handle the situation. Since my friend had me to do this for him, the situation was never alarming, but it was exactly the kind of situation we had expected to avoid by staying in a Novotel.

At the hotel, our original room, which slept only three, was too small for a family of four. We were graciously upgraded to a far superior room. I have no complaints about the staff -- they were perfectly pleasant. However, had I the chance to do it over again, I would opt for a neighborhood and hotel with more personality. Yes, it was well-located and reasonably comfortable, but it was really not a very memorable experience. The lines in the morning for the buffet breakfast were sometimes unpleasantly long as was the wait for the elevator.

Subways - Metro and RER train service are excellent except that they do not have good instructions and signs!!

It was not cleaned the entire time we were there even though we complained twice. My husband complained that the bed was much too stiff, but we are used to a double pillowtop mattress at home. Our room also didn't have an alarm clock (as their website said it would) & all of our wake up calls were \"forgotten\" by the staff. If you're willing to exchange the frills and clean shower for location, by all means stay here...but they won't see us again.", "Date": "April 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGREAT hotel in the heart of Paris!\u201d", "Author": "TravellingMan1999", "ReviewID": "UR7374254", "Content": "If you like a very modern, spacious and friendly hotel, do not look further!

MacDonald and Pizza Hut are right around the corner for those who crave something familiar. Our favourite were the little stalls on the sidewalks where they would bake crepes and gyros.
