The in-room safe was broken and appears to have been broken for a long time. Toilet paper was moldy. There was broken glass on the floor when we got in (looked like a broken lightbulb but all bulbs were in working order) and some trash on the floor that looked like it fell out when housekeeping was cleaning. We were told the hotel was adjacent to the Arc de Triomphe - not quite. It's about a ten minute walk away - as are all the restaurants. Internet access was not working the entire time we were there and there did not appear to be any effort to fix it. Breakfast was included but was not good.

The arc de triomph was a 10 min walk away (come out the main door turn right walk to the end of the street take another right and you will see it at the end) The supermarket across the road is convenient but for restaurants there are not many close by and the resturant that was opposite was closed 2 nights out of the 3 (sat,sunday) there was a nice Italian around the corner that we ate at twice they make a lovely spag bol! If I was to go back to Paris I probably wouldn\u2019t stay again but that is because we have seen it now and I dont think it was a 4 star feel. On my last morning my hubby went to get me a cup of coffee and we were charged 4 euros for a tiny coffee! We also asked if we could have a later check out (the hotel was no where near full) we were told No unless we paid 70 more euros! We did ask for some extra pillows and 1 was delivered within mins.

Having never been in Paris before, I thought that the Arc de triomphe was in central Paris, but I had learnt that the heart of the city was around Notre Dame, on the other side of the river, no where near this hotel at all. Luckily the Paris transport system was efficient! After visiting 4 star hotels within my previous travels, I would have thought there would be at least a conceirge opening doors or carrying our luggage etc. This so called \"4 star hotel\" lacked such facilities. You may call me snobbish but this was the least of my concerns within this hotel, there are more to follow! Before this trip, I had read up and heard it all about the Parisian arrogance against foreign tourists. However I never would have thought there would be such problem within a four star hotel, how wrong was I! The staff were unfriendly and I had felt extremely unwelcome after asking where the nearest currency exchange were. However, I had found the night staff to be the completely opposite to their day time colleagues. I just have to reiterate what other people have said in regards to the rooms. No way in this world that this is a 4 star hotel, the beds were uncomfortable and itchy. We didn't have one good night sleep for the duration of our stay. Not only that, the cleaners don't clean the rooms properly, it was clear that the bedding was rushed on our second day. The only good thing was that they had a powerful but basic shower. The breakfast was limited to cold food, not worth the 19 euros per head to say the least. To end our nightmare, the fire alarm was setted off without warning on our last day. We got woken up at 6am after getting in late. The amount of people staying at this hotel confirmed the reputation of this hotel, there was only about 5 rooms (there are 50 rooms in this hotel) being vacated. They must have been other unfortunate people like us who fell for this cheap package! After the fire alarm turned off we were told we can go back to the rooms. There was no apology or explanation to why this had happened apart from a vague, \"our fire alarms are sensitive.\" Although I had such a torrid time, I was safely say that all of the above are genuine and I haven't exaggerated anything.

The concierge was very pleasant and spoke English when we arrived and allowed us to check-in early (2PM, 3PM check-in).

Rue de Neil and Mac Mahon, the main streets that lead you down to the Arc, have some good shops and restaurants, but it seems to be a lower-key area in general, but you have to try the Aux Armes de Neil bakery, just around the corner from the hotel and across Neil.

The hotel is perfectly adequate for a short stay in Paris. Though for all you lovers out there\u2026 this is not a \u2018romantic\u2019 hotel, think NOVOTEL, basic and clean. The hotel does not have all the little extra touches you may expect from a high \u2018starring\u2019 hotel, but its all you need. AND its not noisy, no doors banging, or people lodly walking along corridors, we slept very well. There are lots of reviews about the breakfast, as our was included in the price we found it perfectly adequate, with the usual meat, cereal, fruit, pastries, bread, eggs, sausages and yoghurts. You go up and help yourself. But we would also recommend finding somewhere local to have breakfast if this is not included in your deal. The sur-rounding area also makes the hotel a great stay. A hop skip and a jump away are a wide selection of authentic Parisian Caf\u00e9\u2019s. They are welcoming of tourists and will make you feel very welcome. We recommend caf\u00e9 Richard, we sat outside and watched the world go by. There are no tacky tourist cafes as there were in the main tourist hot spots of Paris, no beggars on the street or tatty souvenir shops it was a proper taste of Paris. Even with our very limited French, we conversed with the locals who were all lovely. There is also a near by Monoprix (think French Co-Op or Spa) only 1 min walk from the hotel, which has all the essentials you may need. There are also patisseries and other small shops in the local area to the hotel. We enjoyed our stay very much and will happily use this hotel again when we return to Paris.", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverdale, NJ", "Title": "\u201cNot a 4 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "Dr_and_Mr", "ReviewID": "UR34175049", "Content": "Not just to repeat what others have said, but this is not a 4 star hotel by any stretch of the imagination and the air conditioner did not work the first night.

Check in was normal, of course the staff speaks English(they better, it's a hotel!). Our room was a standard size room for a European hotel. This was our first time in Paris, but we have travelled to Europe before. If you compare it to a standard US hotel room, it is small. There is no pool or gym. Don't eat breakfast in the hotel! It's 22 Euros and there are plenty of bakeries/markets/cafes around that serve better food for less money. There is a small mini bar fridge in the room, which we used to keep our water that we bought at the market cold. There is internet access you can purchase at around 20 Euro for 24 hours....rip off! The safe in the room did not work. The shower pressure in the bathroom was very good. The towel warmer in the bathroom was nice also. The weird \"half\" shower doors are standard.

It will give you a good place to rest at night, but will not give your spouse/girlfriend the feeling that you splurged on her. Room cleaning was normal. We went out and saw the sights all day and returned to a clean nice room. The Arc de Triomphe is a 15 minute walk. There are local bakeries, cafe's, and a supermarket nearby. The area is mostly residential with upper class apartments everywhere. We felt very safe walking around at night time. The road the hotel is on can be loud with cars honking in the daytime, but at night time we slept just fine, no loud noises.

The hotel is in a fairly quite area, there was no loud noises at night or anytime that kept us up. We were able to leave our bags and off we went. Once we returned, the room was ready and the was very spacious, not very typical of european hotels. The room's wallpaper did have some wear and tear, but who really cares about minimal rips. The bathroom itself was not huge but the heated bath towel holder was a nice touch. The only issue with the bathroom was the tub. It can be quite dangerous stepping in and out of the tub, it seemed like it was situated bit high. Once had to take a giant step up and down getting in and out of the tub. Which is kind of strange because I have never seen a bath tub that sat up that high. They hotel supplys fairly nice toiletries, they all smell the same. The closet space was ample for two people and to store two suitcases. There also was a safe, in the room. Unable to store a laptop in there. The charge for wireless was ridiculous. I was able to get a signal with my Iphone but declined paying for their service. We didn't try the breakfast at the hotel. There is a great bakery around the corner from the hotel. The crossiants and baguettes were awesome. There is also a Monoprix (supermarket) around the corner, to stock up on drinks. The metro stop (Pereire sp?) was close by and one can navigate from there pretty well. The C line train one should get on is called NORA. We had some trouble the first night getting back to the hotel fromt he Eiffel Tower stop. Nora stops running after awhile. The hotel is great for family and if you want to be away from hustle and bustle of the city. The hotel is about 5-10 min walk to the Arc de Triomphe, but that is the only major atrraction that is near by. I have stayed in the Latin Quarter before and I prefer to stay there. The only thing about the hotel that irked me was the front desk. They were not helpful at all on directions. They actually got me lost twice and decided not to ask them anymore questions after that. Overall, the hotel was a nice quiet place to come and rest your head at the end of the day. I never felt that rooms to be dirty or dingy, I had a room on the second floor and had no problems with noise from the street. I got my reservation through Hotwire so the price was not to bad.

My only complaints would be that there was only one bathrobe, and the minibar was not fully stocked. Other than that I highly recommend - we had a great romantic weekend away!", "Date": "August 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cCute! Cute!

The one word that comes to mind to describe this hotel is CUTE! (if you want an ultra modern urban pad or a huge hotel with a grand swanky lobby - this is NOT your hotel) It is a smaller moderate hotel with a small lobby area and newly decorated breakfast room downstairs from the main entrance. The upper halls and rooms had a very feminine (almost bed and breakfast) feel with light blue striped wallpaper, matching light blue toille bedspreads, and cherry furniture. The room is not huge- but that is pretty standard for Europe- it does have a nice size mirrored closet with shelves. The bathroom is not huge, but not as tiny as I've had in Europe- it had a bath and shower combo and followed the blue and white motif- also it was IMMACULATLY clean with all of the fixtures looking new. It is NOT right at the ARC de Triumph, but a bit removed in a quaint (ie quiet- no street noise) little neighborhood about 5 blocks away. However, this location was still good b/c there was a subway station 2 blocks from the hotel and a grocery store less than 1 block from the hotel. This grocery store was great for snacks that didn't break the bank-there is a referigerator in the room. Getting around was not a problem at all. The staff was pleasant and there is a airport transfer service that was reasonable. This is a great little moderate hotel with a lot of thoughtful (boutique) touches- it didn't seem sterile (homey)... I would stay at this darling little hotel again- no question.", "Date": "July 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cComfortable but location and quality slightly questionable\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4232877", "Content": "When visiting Paris, you want to be close to St Germain and Marais. This Hotel is a little bit out of the way and a pain to travel to and from at night. The hotel was clean and nicely decorated. Booked a double bed and got a twin. They didn't seem to concerned, though the next day they moved our bags with out asking and we were in a slightly larger room with two beds put together! Breakfast is set in a nice lounge, though the cooked breakfast isn't the tastiest. Staff are friendly and helpful.
