So the price was a bit lower than it is at the reception but it was taken 5,5 euro for reservation. The most wonderful property of this hotel is its super location and absolutely safe surrounding area. It is located 3 minutes on foot from the Underground station (two lines!), in the nice, clean (for Paris) boulevard Pasteur. Besides two lines of the Metro, there is Bus line 95, that connects Montparnas with the centre (Louvre) and Montmartre. We had our walks late at night and the area around the hotel seemed very safe. What is more, only 20-30 minutes on foot from the hotel (in an unhurried manner) and you are in front of the Eiffel tour or Palace of Invalide. From our window we could see Montparnasse Tour (10 minutes on foot). Concerning the staff they were rather pleasant and useful. But people who would like to choose this hotel should be ready that it is 2*, furniture is very simple (only TV is modern:, flat and rather big), there is no safe in the room, only on the reception. The bathroom was rather clean but not new. Very often tourists complain on the size of the bathroom.

We picked the hotel for its location and price. The recent comment that it was too expensive surprises me given that this is Paris. We booked through our travel agent and the breakfast was included. While on that subject I would say that breakfast was better than most I've had in France. There was fresh fruit, cheese, cereal, croissants and rolls, juice, tea and coffee or hot chocolate. Enough to get us started and no one seemed to mind when we made a cheese roll to take for a later snack. The reception staff were exceptionally welcoming, our flight arrived very early and we were at the hotel by 10 am. We were directed to a cafe nearby where we had a coffee and croissant and the room was ready on our return. Better service than we have had at many 4 star hotels. The room was spotlessly clean, yes small but so are all Parisian hotel rooms. My husband, a retired pilot, has stayed in several 5 star hotels in Paris and he commented that the room was no smaller than some of those. The ensuite was modern, large and had a great shower. We were at the back and could just spy the Eiffel Tower which was a bonus. Reception were very helpful with directions, providing a map with the hotel marked. They also pointed out the best and most economical local cafes of which there are many. The reception staff spoke English well and the room staff was very cheerful. The location was perfect, we were going on a river cruise and wanted to be close to the quai, it was about a 10 minute taxi ride. The Pasteur Metro stop is immediately opposite the hotel and you can walk everywhere if so inclined. We are great walkers so tended to use the Metro in the evening to return to the hotel. There are fascinating back streets and markets near the hotel and, as its is in a residential district, you get a real sense of how Parisians live. There were several French families staying at the Innova while we were there and I take that as a good sign of a hotel's value for money. If you are in Paris take the hop on and off boat from the quai below the Eiffel Tower. It is great value and offers a very different way to see Paris. An all day ticket is 12Euro and there are 6 stops. Also, don't miss the Deportation Memorial behind Notre Dame, it is moving and mostly overlooked by tourists. For a cheap and good evening meal go into the Latin Quarter and eat before 7pm, we had a great 3 course meal for 10 Euros!

The 51 room hotel is 50 yards from the Metro Pastuer on a fairly busy Boulevard..

Extra pillows were available in the room. No drawer space, but an adequate wardrobe with 12 hangers!!, and unit with 2 wide shelves. Free WiFi access worked well,Flat screen TV, with English(BBC and CNN) news. Bathroom with shower small but very clean and new fixtures..Excellent water pressure in the shower. Remember this hotel is on a thoroughfare with traffic. There will be some noise, but we were on the 6th floor and the new windows muffled most of the sound. Rather neat to hear the sounds of the city We had excellent A/C in our room... check on booking.Telephone and desk with chair in room. Reception desk staff quietly friendly and helpful even though our french is poor. We were able to get to Versailles,the Louvre, Orsay,Cluny,Arc de Triumph, Sacre Coeur,etc easily using the Metro. Remember to buy your tickets in a \"carnet\"(10 tickets) for EU12.70. We walked to Napoleons tomb and Les Invalides museum in about 25 minutes. The Eiffel tower took quite a bit longer, but is do-able. Very near Gare Montparnasse which is a very large station...about 15-20 minutes downhill to hotel . (Make sure you go up the Montparnasse Tower...views are amazing...better than the Eiffel Tower. Not as long lines and cheaper!!) Bus to Gare du Nord across the road near Cafe Pasteur. We dined here once, whIch catered to the younger local crowd, Food and service good .La Salle a Manger (3 doors down from the hotel) had a reasonable fixed price menu (EU17.20 at time of writing) for 2 courses. we ate here 3 times ...all good! Especially the lamb shanks1 We booked online and got a good deal and excellent email service.

I was looking for a hotel that wasn't swanky, was reasonably priced, clean and comfortable, without the trimmings. While I can recommend Hotel Innova as a (mostly) suitable place, two major issues stood out for me as a female solo traveller, which made my stay not particularly enjoyable that I thought I'd share: * Noise: when booking, request a room at the back of the hotel. I had hardly any sleep for two nights out of three due to traffic noise and pedestrians. I am a moderately light sleeper admittedly, but it was a very noisy road, and it drove me a tad nuts, even with the window sealed shut. Also, if booking one of the single rooms, try to NOT get Rooms 14 or 15 - ie: rooms on the first floor, right next to the elevator, hotel office and breakfast room. This means that from 7am onwards you will be awake listening to every single guest dining walking past your room, the lift repeatedly opening, hotel office staff talking outside in the corridor etc. Add to that the fact that on two days they were doing renovations (driling, hammering, all without notice?) above my room... needless to say there was no sleep in's at all. So the big lesson is: get a a room not on the first floor, and one at the back! * Location: yes, the Metro is right across from the hotel which makes is super easy for travel. But, what people here didn't mention (or maybe no one else felt it?) is that Blvd Pasteur/Montparnasse itself is rather... atmosphere-less. I felt like I was out of the action somewhat. As a solo traveller, after three days of walking around and hanging out with pals I realised I would have loved being in the buzz of somewhere like St Michel, St Germain, or the ambience of \u00cele Saint-Louis. Montmartre, even. My Parisian friends all thought Montparnasse was out of the action. I found wandering the streets at 10pm looking for food eerily quiet after the buzz of the Latin Quarter.

The hotel appears to have been refurbished recently and is spotless throughout. All three front-of-house staff with whom we dealt were helpful and patient with our less-than-flawless French. The rooms are not big but neither are they conspicuously small by Parisian standards in this price range and the bed was comfortable. The en-suite shower room was again compact but perfectly useable with abundant shower pressure. One point to bear in mind: not all rooms in the hotel are air-conditioned and initially we were given a non-AC room on the fourth floor of the hotel facing Boulevard Pasteur. It was too warm to sleep without an open window but it is a busy road throughout the night and very noisy, consequently we asked to move to an air-conditioned room. We were given a sixth floor room on the rear of the hotel with a super view of the Eiffel Tower (about two thirds of it!) and it made a huge difference. I would struggle to recommend staying in a non-AC room during warm weather. Breakfast was delicious and excellent value (9 Euros). The hotel is very well located for left-bank sights, for example Les Invalides and the Eiffel Tower (each approx twenty minute walk), St Germain, Le Jardin De Luxembourg etc. Nearby Montparnasse has a great selection of restaurants, particularly Breton creperies.

Breakfast consisted of a tray with some breads, coffee/tea/chocolate and a separate small buffet of fruits, yoghurt, fruit juices and the likes. I suspect one could get more bread than what is served by default, but as the basics were enough for me I cannot be sure.

The en suite shower room was small but adequate and with a superb shower and lovely new tiling. The new flat screen TV had an integrated DVD - if we'd known that then we'd have taken some DVDs to watch as the only English channels we could find on the satellite TV were CNN and Eurosport! But maybe we just didn't master the complicated remote. The location is excellent. The Pasteur Metro station is right outside the door in a wide tree-lined avenue. But we walked to most places - 20 minutes to the Champs de Mars, and then a 10 minute stroll to the Eiffel Towel. About 30 minutes walk also to Ile de la Cite (via Jardin du Luxembourg). The reception desk staff were all friendly, helpful and English speaking. And the breakfast buffet was great. A simple but good selection - cereals, juice, fruit salad, various breads and buns, jams, yoghurt etc - and we could eat as much as we wanted. That set us up well for the day and we only needed snack-bars and fruit for so that was a real saving. (We were on a tight budget so were also glad to find a relatively inexpensive Chinese restaurant round the corner where we ate each evening.) The only downside ended up as a big plus. I'd carefully booked a hotel on the Eurostar Planet (Expedia) webpage which had \"breakfast included\" but on arrival we were told that this was definitely not the case. I had a print out from the Eurostar webpage saying 'breakfast included' (I'd half-suspected it might not be as the booking confirmation didn't mention it and the price was very reasonable) but the desk-clerk insisted that this was Eurostar's mistake, not theirs. I accepted this without making too much fuss and we resigned ourselves to having to pay out for breakfast and take it up with Eurostar on our return. But when we got back to the hotel on the first evening the manager had decided to honour Eurostar's details (which had by then been corrected on the webpage). That was a grand and welcome gesture, and typical of the cheerful helpfulness that we found throughout our 3 night stay.

Let me check in early, breakfast ladies were always cheerful/happy to help :) Cons: Tiny rooms (to be expected from paris i guess) and tiny tiny bathroom, walls kinda thin (was woken on one occasion by neighbours' nocturnal activities, but otherwise slept well throughout my stay), construction work was going on on the facade of the hotel the time that i was there so was woken on weekday mornings by voices of the workers outside my window, but i didn't mind too much, and i wonder if the construction's finished now, residential area so not too much by way of activities around the hotel-would be more suitable for family oriented people, but it suited my purposes just fine Comfortable enough stay..perhaps a little pricey though....next time i'd probably stay something cheaper/ a more lively area like the marais/latin quarter/oberkampf/bastille area for nightlife/character...but wouldn't complain if i stayed at innova again :)", "Date": "August 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "british columbia", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, small rooms, ok service, I would recommend\u201d", "Author": "dsbc", "ReviewID": "UR37095416", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel Innova from June 29th-July 4th 2009.

Pastries, breads, cheese, cereal, juice, coffee (the best coffee of our trip), fruit salad. Rooms: The room was small, clean, newer with two twin beds and a balcony. Having the small balcony made the room feel bigger. They had a flat screen t.v with a good selection of channels. The bathroom was small with a shower (no bathtub) and was always clean.

What bothered me the most was though was the following. The front desk keeps the key to your room when you leave for the day. When we returned the first night, the desk clerk was the same person who checked us in so that was not a problem. However, on the 2nd and 3rd night the desk clerk was two different people who neither knew us nor we knew him. When we asked for the room key it was given to us with no questions asked. After it happened the first time we advised management the next day, but clearly nothing was said to staff because it happened again. It quite scary to think that any stranger could walk into the hotel and ask for room number xxx and be given the key, no questions asked. Training of the front desk staff is clearly needed.

I cannot recommend this hotel ENOUGH. We had a fabulous stay and I must thank all the reviews on trip advisor for helping me find this wonderful hotel. We had a twin double room. The room and bathroom were small (as can only be expected for Paris, trust me) but impeccably clean, newly renovated, and nicely decorated. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was up to American standards. This hotel is a true \"find\" because it is newly renovated and clean but still feels Parisian. The elevator worked fine and was much larger than many elevators in Paris(held a few people and their luggage). I booked it through a web deal and paid 100 euros per night. The staff were very friendly. They are bilingual but kindly spoke French with us to help us practice our french skills. One gentleman was very helpful when we needed to organize our airport transport. He took time with us and explained the different options ( we chose the shuttle which takes 1 hour and costs 12 euros per person to Charles de Gaulle). We didn't have any problems with noise in our room. In fact, the hotel was very quiet. The only downside to our room was that the hotel had scaffolding across the entire front of it so our view and balcony were blocked. Hotel Innova is in the 15th arrondissement. It's one block away from the Pasteur metro stop (easy access to many popular parts of the city: Latin Quarter, Madeleine/Opera area, Champs Elysee, Montmartre). Montparnasse ( a very busy and fun area) is a 5-10 minute walk away. The Seine is a 15-20 minute walk north. The Luxembourg Gardens are also a 20 minute walk. This location isn't as touristy as others, but it is very safe and also has a nice Parisian residential feel to it that other areas lose due to tourists. Hotel Innova may not be directly near any major monuments/museums BUT it is located near metros that make is extremely convenient to get to any and all of those attractions. I will definitely stay at Innova on my next trip to Paris. Don't miss out on an amazing restaurant around the corner, Le Dix Vins on Rue Falguiere.

First of all, I have to say Hotel Innova deserves way more than its two-star rating. It's more like a good three-star hotel, judging from my recent experience there. I stayed three nights, paying about 83 euros a night. It's not exactly a budget rate, but I wanted a place with decent reviews and in a safe area as I was a female traveller in Paris alone. I had requested for a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower but the hotel manager told me when I checked in that all their rooms with a view of the tower were occupied, and he was very apologetic about it. He gave me a corner room on the second floor which was huge and probably amazing value, since I had paid the rate for a single room. It had a double bed and TWO single beds and could probably take up to four people. The room was clean and neat, as was the bathroom, which had a bath-tub. For a two-star hotel, the attention paid to little details in the room was much appreciated. There were plenty of clean towels (changed every day), basic toiletries like soap and shampoo, and extra pillows and blankets in the wardrobe, which also came with many hangers. Both the room and bathroom had a heater, which kept me warm and comfortable in the winter nights in Paris. The reception had someone around the clock, so safety wasn't really an issue, and the staff were always friendly and helpful when it came to recommendations on places to see in the area. They also spoke good English. The hotel lift was out of order when I arrived, and the hotel manager offered to help me with my heavy luggage without me asking. The next day, the lift was up and working again. The hotel is just right opposite the entrance to Pasteur metro station, which makes exploring Paris very convenient. I would return to the hotel late at night, sometimes after 11pm, and the area felt safe and was well-lit. Right next door to the hotel is a nice cafe, Relais Le Montparnasse, which does a small breakfast set for 5.50 euros in the morning. The staff there speak basic English so no problems when it comes to ordering. Across the street, there is a pharmacy if you need to get anything. The only quibble I can find with this hotel is that the floors and walls are a bit thin, and you can often hear the occupant of the room above you moving around. It can also be a bit noisy when people return to their rooms late at night.

My advice is to take a sound soother machine as we did - it drowns out any loud neighbors which we had. The concierge (all of them) were very helpful at all times. They helped us get our baggage that the airline lost, make dinner reservations, find locations on a map and reserved us a taxi to the airport. The lobby could use a little updating but for the money you can't beat this hotel. We highly recommend it. I would also recommend getting a 5-day metro pass if visiting the city - it costs around 45 Euro. Also, learn how to order a carafe of water in French - you will save a ton of money. There is a great restaurant across the street and down on the corner that had a nice breakfast. If you want a true Paris experience - take a dinner cruise or make reservations at Altitude 95 (Restaurant in the Eiffel Tower).", "Date": "March 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, OH", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for us\u201d", "Author": "s004mjo", "ReviewID": "UR13916387", "Content": "Our stay at Hotel Innova was excellent.

We stayed at the Innova for three nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. We had a third floor front room with en-suite, and although our accommodation was fairly compact it suited our needs perfectly. The bedroom consisted of a double bed, wardrobe, two small tables with two chairs, and the en-suite was fitted with a powerful shower instead of a bath \u2013 which suited us just fine. In addition there was a colour TV and hair dryer provided. Our room had a small balcony that overlooked the main street; the access to the balcony was via a pair of new upvc double glazed French windows, which in turn were covered by drapes. Considering our room was at the front we weren\u2019t really bothered by any traffic noise, it just seemed to be part of the normal background ambience. However, for an extra cost there are rooms available at the rear away from the main road for anyone wishing for that extra bit of piece and quiet! The room was cleaned and serviced daily to a high standard and we found most of the staff to be helpful and friendly, especially the French gentleman (I think he may have been the manager) who was on duty in the mornings. The location of this hotel was excellent, in the immediate vicinity there are plenty of shops of all descriptions including cafes, bars, restaurants, supermarkets, pharmacies etc. Just over the road from the hotel is Pasteur Metro, which in turn links you up to anywhere within the city. Most times we would walk to the major attractions located alongside the river and enjoy the unexpected sights along the way. An easy stroll to the Invalides or the Eiffel Tower would take about 15/20 minutes. The whole area around the hotel felt safe and there wasn\u2019t any sense of aggression or intimidation even later on in the night, in fact we found most of Paris to be the same. We didn\u2019t really have any complaints considering we were staying in Paris in a low cost two star hotel \u2013 although a very good two star! Okay, the bathroom was a bit small but if you want a huge apartment you have to be prepared to spend a lot more and we found it perfectly adequate anyway. I guess it would have been just right if the room was fitted with a small fridge in order for us to store drinks etc. but that is only a minor fault. As an afterthought, if we stayed again at this time of year (July) and the weather was just as hot I think I would spend the extra few Euros for a room with air-con; as it was, we just left the balcony window open \u2013 no problems. Next time we visit Paris we would definitely stay there again, and recommend the Innova to like minded travellers who just need a base to rest and recuperate while enjoying this marvellous city.", "Date": "August 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Town", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "DuffCT", "ReviewID": "UR5536415", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel Innova for 4 nights at the end of June. My husband and I shared a family room with our 2 daughters, our first trip to Paris. We were really pleased with the hotel, which we had chosen over the Internet, with help from Trip Advisor. It's in a very good location, with an underground stop right outside, cafe's all around, supermarkets, etc. We had a wonderful time in Paris! Would definitely stay in this hotel again. One tip for future tourists - bring along some little plastic bowls and some cutlery sets, get food at the local supermarkets, and you'll save a lot of money and have fun picnicing in the bargain.", "Date": "August 1, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Innova", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d264705-Reviews-Hotel_Innova-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$116 - $253*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">32 boulevard Pasteur</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">15 Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75015</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "264705", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/05/71/05713bfbe4d6d38b3df56d02ba2771a44large.jpg"}}
