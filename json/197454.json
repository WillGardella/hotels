The bathroom was huge and there were bathrobes for the guest to use. It was however, I little ackward to take a shower. You had to hold the shower head. Warning about the elevator. It only holds 4 people and even at that, it is tight. As soon as the elevator doors open, and you step out, there is the staircase with no protective railing. If you have heavy, or ackward bags this may be something to watch out for. The Internet service was a paid one. I know i paid cash for 3 tickets and charged a 4th one to my room. When I went to check out and was reviewing my bill, the girl at the front desk actually Charged my room for those three internet tickets. I was able to dispute them with the night Auditor and after 10 mins, he reversed the charges. Breakfast was NOT included in the room rate. and even though it was a little expensive, it was worth it.

Hotel location is very good, a bit less hectic than staying in the touristy areas, felt safe. 2 minutes to Argentine metro but we tended to use Charles de Gaulle Etoile (Arc de Triomphe) station a 5 minutes walk away giving access to the metro or RER-A. RER-A took 2 stops to the Louvre and ran direct to Disneyland Paris (well worth visiting even just for a day, tiring). We travelled from CDG airport taking about 1 hour using RER-B & RER-A. There are a handful of restaurants close by, French one on the same street as the hotel and an Italian at the far end of the street. There is a shop (drinks, snacks, fruit etc) open till after midnight near the Argentine metro entrance. Hotel reception staff where very welcoming and helpful and all spoke English. Had some difficulty conversing with the breakfast staff. Family room was the main reason for booking this hotel and we where not disappointed. Two good size rooms with a private hall between, one double room and one twin room each room having its own bathroom, air conditioning, tea/coffee tray, television & free safe. It was much better than all being squashed together in one quad room. Rooms where spotlessly clean and very comfortable. Very good selection for breakfast, as well as continental choice we where surprised to find sausage, scrambled egg and bacon (if you where lucky). Only had bacon one day as it kept running out.

Upon arrival (which took us approx 20 minutes by taxi from Gare Du Nord), we were greeted by two very friendly staff members who checked us in & took our bags up to our room. While they done this we waited in the reception area which was very warm & cozy. As it was around 8pm on our arrival, we were very hungry & they were more than helpful in guiding us to McDonalds, which is about a 10minute walk from the hotel. We were in room 55 - which if I remember is on the 5th floor. We didn't have a fantastic view out of our window - but it didn't put us off. The rooms are of a lovely size - we had a double room which featured a Bose TV with pay to view tv, Bose Phone, VERY comfy double bed, double wardrobe with safe, ironing board and iron and also a very reasonably sized bathroom - very big bath, hot water, robes & complimentary toiletries. Throughout our visit we came along many little treasures - On walking to McDonalds, you can find a lovely little pizza shop which offer eat in or takeaway options (we had this on the 2nd day & it was amazing!!), a bakery (2minutes around the corner from the hotel - offering croissants of every variety, baguettes, sandwiches, cakes, etc), a small grocers (offering drinks, food, etc) & also a sweet shop. Both located within 5 minutes walking distance. Moving along, down the Champs Elysees there are many restaurants from Indian, Chinese, Thai, Mexican, and of course French Cusine - one place I would recommend is the Pizza restaurant which is near to the Louis Vuitton store - for a 14\"Pizza, Fries & 2 drinks it cost appoximately \u00a315, which is very good for Paris. Nearer to the Notre Dame, you can find many bakeries and restaurants, but here they are slightly more expensive. Attractions & Things to Do The 'La Defense Arch' is to the left as you walk out of the hotel street - approximately a 20minute walk. As you turn right out of the street, you can walk to the Arc de Triomphe (5minutes) - the best time of day to go up is about 6pm as it is alot less busy & is slightly cheaper - you get some amazing views. Other places, I would recommend are The Louvre (you need a day here), Musee d'Orsay, Notre Dame, Eiffel Tower, Moulin Rouge, Sacre Coeur & Monmarte and also a boat tor of the Seine - this is were you get the best views of Paris & not only that you can buy 'Boat-Bus' passes which are valid from half a day up to 7 days. These stop at all the attractions I have listed above & more. Also, very cheap!! Traveling Around The best way to travel is by foot if you have the energy - we saw some amazing views by doing this & saved a bit of money. For these who arent so keen on doing this, I would deffinitely recommend the Metro - very easy to use (just like the London Underground) and once you have used once, it is very simple. Free Metro maps are available at each stop. This is a very cheap way of travelling around & also stops at the main attactions. One thing which I have to say is a negative about Paris & I'm sure other people who have visited would agree is that you have to be very aware of Con-Artists & Pick Pockets, especially around the attractions - our main one was the Eiffel Tower. Some woman followed me into the toilets & tried to get money off me, thankfully there were guards around & told her to go away. Just please be very cautious!! Overall, I would agree with what everyone says - this is the City of Love & I am planning another trip here next year!!

It is one street in from the Champs, but the street bisects the Champs at a 45 degree angle; the hotel is about 15-20 feet from the angle itself. So, it could be on a bad street, except the bad part would be about 200-300 yards from the hotel and the Champs. At the angle you have a bakery, cafes, an authentic sushi restaurant (lived 6 years in Japan), and the hotel. On Christmas, we walked from the hotel, onto Champs, one block to Arch de Triumph, and all the way to Louvre. Lovely long walk and quite safe. Very nice staff: receptionist greeted us every morning, porter gave lots of tips, and maid service actually cleaned. Don't know about restaurant though.

Overall, the hotel was spotless. the only complaint I have about the hotel is the breakfast - the waitresses did not have much english (not their fault I suppose as they are french!!) and the breakfast was very limited. Only juices, croissants, bread and cheese, small amount of cereals. there were no omlettes or boiled eggs at all. (these were on the room service menu for breakfast but not available in the restaurant?) The hotel is only about 6 or 7 minute walk from the arc de triomphe at the top of the champs elyssee. and there is the yellow line metro about 2 minutes walk from the front door of the hotel which took us directly to the main shopping area and the galeries lafayette. the location of the hotel is just perfect as it is on a small quiet street just off the avenue de la grand armee.
