{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Lots of hidden charges We found this hotel through the Frankfurt Airport's webpage. At only \u9227?8 a night quoted on the webpage, we thought that we were getting quite a good deal. Well, we were mistaken. They said on their page they offer a Free airport shuttle. Well, the shuttle is free, but ONLY when you travel from the airport to their hotel. If you want to leave their hotel and catch a ride on the bus back to the Airport, it is \u9227? a person. This was not mentioned on the original booking page. So their free airport shuttle is NOT free. Their hotel restaurant's average price is between \u9227?5 to \u9227?0 a person (just for the main course) and a standard size coke from the vending machine is \u9227?. They have a mini-bar in the room, but the prices are not any cheaper. The is absolutely nothing else in the area surrounding the hotel, so there is nothing you can walk to. If you want to get back to the airport to find cheaper food you have to pay the \u9227?/person bus fee to get back. When we checked in, we were asked if we would like breakfast, and we said sure, because the front desk lady said nothing about it costing anything, so we said ok. Well, sometimes accidents happen while on vacation, and you don't always wake up when you would like to, so we were unable to get breakfast as we had expected. We went to check out and that's when we found out that our hotel bill was not the \u9227?8 quoted online, but \u9227?13!!!! YES you read that right, they charge you \u9227?5 for breakfast for 2 people. We tried to tell the lady that we had not had a chance to get the breakfast because we were running late, and had to make it to the airport. However, she was unapologetic, unsympathetic, and unwilling to get rid of the charge for us (this was the only hotel I've ever been to that would not do anything to help their guests). The front desk person, told us that it had already been added to the bill and the could not take it off regardless if we had asked for the breakfast or not. We had to leave to make our flight so we were unable to stay there and argue it out. So I'm out \u9227?5 (approx. ~ $45USD), and have no recourse against them. So be warned when you stay here it may not be the bargain that it appears online. I guess their system is ok for those people who are business travelers and the company picks up the tab. However, it's not an acceptable system to me because I'm out an extra \u9227?5 for nothing. I was unhappy with the hotels staff unwillingness to help someone out. I travel through Frankfurt quite frequently and I can definitely say that I will never be staying at this hotel ever again. I cannot recommend this hotel after the way I was treated.", "Date": "Dec 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR440667487", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Northshore357"}, {"Content": "A good overnight stay at Frankfurt airport This was my second stay at this hotel (previous time was few years back).The hotel was renovated since my last stay but it is by no means luxurious or a vacation resort.As an airport hotel for a quick stay between flights it gives you exactly what you would expect.

We had read the other reviews here.The room we had ordered (airport view) apparently didn't because the room they send us to was viewing nothing but the hotel back yard. No mention at check in though.Since I had to while away a few hours on my own when my husband dropped our car off with his parents I would really have liked to watch the planes.Also, the room charge was higher because of air conditioning.But, that was the least problem.We had tons of luggage as we were going away for over 3 weeks and there was no luggage cart visible and no help was offered to us. Still, they put us in the room furthest away from the elevator.When I looked around the room, I noticed the window was cracked. There was no draft, but this still was not so great. The air conditioner worked, but was so noisy we had to turn it off at night. Seeing I could not see planes I decided to watch some TV. Nothing. Just grey. I checked the TV and the cable tv cord had been unplugged. So I had to move that TV around a lot to insert the cord. The blankets provided were really, really thick and we were really hot in those beds over night. The toilet flush had to be pressed down hard otherwise it didn't flush alright.The shower was broken also. When I stepped in only a lame little water trickle left the shower head so I changed the shower head to the stronger shower, but the water just leaked out of the back sides of the shower head, with no more strength than the other. The window curtain had a big rip in it. With all those negatives, there were also a few nice things: the one comfy chair was really comfy. The beds were pretty comfortable also. They provided a hair and body shampoo in squeezable containers in the shower and near the sink. I think that is quite good for the environment, but if you didn't bring your own lotion you will have none. No shower cap either.We could check our luggage in at night so I was on my own with 3 suitcases. Again, no help. The lady at the front desk asked if I went again the next morning and let me ride the airport bus shuttle for free that night.When we checked out next morning and complained about all those things we still had to pay for the airport shuttle. (5 Euros per person). With so many problems that should have been the least they could have given us. We never tried their big breakfast, but tea and coffee with croissants and Nutella and jam and butter was quite enough, especially as you get a lot of food on your flight usually.Next time we are flying out early we will try another hotel in the area, especially as there are a few you can walk to from the terminal instead of paying extra money for a shuttle bus.", "Date": "Sep 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR804272170", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "stefmaus"}, {"Content": "Clean, Comfortable, Consistant In my travels through FRA I have used this hotel often as a place to stay over before a morning flight home.

The area is aptly named since there is literally nothing else around the hotel except warehouses full of cargo waiting to come into the city or go out of the airport. The Intercity Frankfurt Airport Hotel, which makes it a perfect choice for a night's stay before a early morning flight. My husband and I stayed at this hotel the night before we leave Frankfurt to Malaysia. This seemed to be a good spot prior to leaving on early flight.This hotel is part of the Steinberger chain of hotels. But note that there is another hotel, called Steinberger Hotel Airport. Do not confuse the two and take the wrong shuttle bus. Which, we did. Oops! The bus driver was kind enough to send us back to Terminal 2 to wait for the correct shuttle bus again.The hotel offers a free shuttle service to and from each airport terminal, every half hour. This is on a full-size city bus, and it is heavily utilized. But for our needs, traveling via free shuttle from/to the airport was easy enough. If in the future I were in need of an airport hotel for a one-night stay, I would consider this one. The shuttle bus is very spacious and it's very convenient to carry our baggage and stroller in the bus no doubt the bus do not have luggage storage compartment.

We find the rooms fairly spacious, clean and comfortable but some might find the bathrooms a bit tiny even by European standards, and contained a shower with no tub. No bar soap or shampoo was provided. Instead, liquid dispensers containing body wash were installed in the shower and next to the sink.Strangely enough, the bed slept well and was comfortable. Items in the mini-bar were reasonably priced and TV has English channels. Staff was professional and courteous. Queues for reception always seemed to be a bit long but the staffs were helpful and friendly. The service is ok and English is spoken by all.The restaurant (The Fluggi) had a decent buffet at each mealtime, and the food was good. Breakfast buffet is extensive and of a high quality. Excellent! There was a variety of fruits, yogurts, pastries, eggs, bacon and sausages with plenty of tea and coffee (expresso machine) to go around. The buffet dinner (forgotten how much we paid for) were fine but not memorable. The pub (Ju 52) was quaint and stocked with plenty of good beer and spirits.There is Internet in the lobby at an outrageous two Euros per minute. This is a good airport hotel, especially if you are looking for something close to the airport, but don't want to spend a fortune, this is a good choice. It is quite basic, but it beats the alternative of having to try and rush to the airport from other areas in the morning!

It is a little too basic and cheaply furnished by standards that I am used to, but I will try not to be needlessly harsh with my comments.I stayed at the InterCity Frankfurt Airport Hotel for three nights to attend a business meeting at the property. The hotel is located right near the airport property in a suburb known as Cargo City Sud (South). The area is aptly named since there is literally nothing else around the hotel except warehouses full of cargo waiting to come in to the city or go out of the airport. If you need some small item from the store or access to an ATM, then you will be spending about 15 euros in taxi fare to get it. I briefly toyed with the idea of renting a car, but after closer inspection I noticed that there would be no place to park it at the hotel.Upon arrival at the hotel, I was underwhelmed. The facade of the hotel is done in a drab, depressing combination of white, gray, and black. This, in conjunction with the overall flat, plain style and design of the building, creates a structure that is more-than-reminiscent of a minimum security prison. That aside, the hotel grounds were very nice and well-kept. In the front were many mature trees and hedges that surrounded a nice volleyball court and beer-garden. There is a bronze plaque in the entryway proudly announcing that the hotel is rated as a four-star property (based on a five-star scale) through 2009 by the fine folks at the Deutschland Hotel Council. I found myself not only strongly disagreeing with this rating, but also wondering how spectacularly bad a one-star hotel would be. Not a pleasant thing to contemplate.The inside of the hotel is splashed in an unfortunate, unattractive combination of reds, whites, and several different hues of blue. This may be a quibble of sorts, or even just a taste preference, but all of the curtains were inexplicably a pastel peach color. Most of the public areas at this hotel are not air conditioned, and all of the hallways had a stuffy, stale feel except near the stairwells where the windows were always open. My room did have a vent, but it must have been controlled centrally since no air came out of it and there was no thermostat to be found. A colleague of mine also staying at the hotel said his room had a/c, but it didn't work. It wasn't unbearably hot in my room, but it was necessary to have some fresh air. Unfortunately, getting some fresh air inside my room required opening the solitary window. This was indeed a dilemma. When the window was open, some fresh air was allowed in along with a hint of greasy fumes from the kitchen exhaust vents that were located nearby. Some fine particulates also floated in when the window was open, and I suspect these were either grease flakes from the kitchen or rubber particles from the very busy (and noisy) motorway that was adjacent to the property. This could have just been due to which way the wind was blowing when I was there, but I don't plan to really find out by visiting the property again.All of the hotel employees were attentive and seemed eager to please. The restaurant (The Fluggi) had a decent buffet at each mealtime, and the food was good. The pub (Ju 52) was quaint and stocked with plenty of good beer and spirits. The bartenders were friendly and kept the libations flowing well even though it was extremely busy each time I was there. My room was clean but spartan. The bathroom was tiny even by European standards, and contained a shower with no tub. No bar soap or shampoo was provided. Instead, liquid dispensers containing body wash were installed in the shower and next to the sink. A grand total of three towels were provided each day. One for the shower, one for the sink, and one as the bathmat. They were all the same size and texture, so I guess it really didn't matter how they were used. The room did have a decently stocked minibar, which was an unexpected surprise in a hotel of this caliber. The bed was a double-sized mattress (no box springs) suspended about three inches above the floor by a leather wrapped bedframe. A solitary pillow and single-sized combination sheet/comforter were provided. I guess the hotel management figured you wouldn't be cold enough to need a double-sized sheet. They are right, I suppose, if you aren't brave enough to open the window. Strangely enough, the bed slept well and was comfortable. Or, maybe it was just the jetlag. Who knows?The hotel literature in the room said that only dial-up internet access was available (who does that anymore?), but I soon discovered, fortunately, that there was wireless access available for 15 euro/day. Overall, this would be an okay hotel to stay at for one night if you had a long layover or wanted to rest before a long flight. Even then, I'm sure that there are better alternatives nearby with nicer facilites. Unless you absolutely have to be near the airport don't stay here. The money you save on the cheap nightly rate will be spent on taxis or buses into the city. I guess my British colleague stated it best when he said, This isn't a proper business hotel!", "Date": "May 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR991845822", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "MidnightClear"}, {"Content": "Functional but fine This hotel is fine for a functional stay but it didn't offer anything special.

As I never give a credit card number over an unsecure e-mail server, particularly when the person asking for it contacted me first; the problem with the initial card number given was not uncovered for several days.
