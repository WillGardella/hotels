I called to confirm our reservation for a 'smoking room with two twin beds' the night before we arrived and was assured that everything was in order. We checked in at approximately 1:00pm the following day and were told that our 'non-smoking room with one double bed' wouldn't be available until 2:00pm. Obviously the system broke down but the gentleman behind the counter was very helpful and quickly sorted things out for us. We were in room #609 on the top floor which provided a view of the unremarkable east London landscape. The room was small but clean and contained a television, a desk area with a chair, and a kettle with coffee and tea. We found the beds comfortable and each came with two pillows tagged with 'firm' and 'soft' although we couldn't tell the difference. The bathroom was spotless but there are no amenities. The soap and shampoo are one in the same and dispersed from a wall mounted unit in the shower. The towels were a nice size but disappointingly thin. There was no mini-bar or in-room safe, although there are safe deposit boxes in the lobby - there may be a fee attached to use them, we didn't bother. The Expedia website lists 'Wireless Internet Access' as one of the hotel's room amenities but there's a \u00a315 per day charge for that and we passed. The computer in the lobby, if used for less than 10 minutes per day, is free... but longer than that and the \u00a315 charge is applied to your bill. The hotel provides breakfast from 6:30 - 9:30 which is comprised of scrambled eggs, sausage and beans, (it's a British thing), along with the typical assortment of cold items: cereals, breads, fruit. The sausage was extremely poor quality but everything else was quite nice and the hot chocolate from the machine dispenser was surprisingly good. The Stratford International Rail Station offers both the Central and Jubilee tube lines for getting into the city center and the station is roughly a ten minute walk from the hotel. The new Stratford High Street station for the Docklands Light Railway is much closer and very convenient if using City Airport.

When we arrived we were told that there had been a mistake and that we were booked in a twin room with no cot. We were told the cot would not fit in the room. So after waiting in the reception area for 30 minutes we were shown a double room which was a smoking room. This was dismissed straight away as it had a horrible smell of stale smoke. So finally after an hour of waiting we were given the twin room that they had origanally booked us in which the cot did fit it. On the thursday afternon we arrived back to the hotel to find that no room service had been. No clean towles,bins not emptied,no tea or coffee ect. So called reception and asked for some new ones. We rang twice in half an hour and in the end my husband had to go down and get it. Then to top it all of the fire alarm sounded at 10pm Thursday night. Unsure of what was happening i called reception 3 times for the phone to go unansweres. i left the room and went to see what was going on.I went from the 5th floor to the ground only for the doors to be locked. I then had to run back up the 5 flights of stairs to tell my husband that we should leave the hotel. Wrapping my daughter in a blanket we left the hotel to find guests and staff all stood outside. We were out there for about 40 minutes. It was freezing and not one memeber of staff came to see if we were ok ( more my daughter than us) No one told us what was going on .

After reading through some of the reviews, they are mainly positive, which is good, as this hotel deserves to be credited. The hotel is a ten minute walk away from Stratford Station and if you do stay during the winter period, then it can be quite a treacherous walk from the tube station to the hotel. From my first stay, the staff were really friendly and accommodating. In this regard, two members of staff stand out and these are Stella and Joel. I have seen reception crowded and the staff being bombarded with requests for information and also guests wanting to check in and they dealt with everything admirably. I have never eaten at the hotel as due to my work I am either late arriving back at the hotel or I order a take away from the menus that are available from reception, which nobody seemed to mention in their reviews. However I have seen some of the food being delivered to other guests and it doesn\u2019t look that bad at all. 3 courses for just over \u00a315 seems quite reasonable to me. The facilities are what you expect from the HIX brand and I have stayed in many, with most of them being in London. I just haven\u2019t had time to review them all! However, this one stands out as one of the best I have stayed in while working in London. I get the train down from Leeds, so don\u2019t use the car park. If there are indeed only 10 spaces and the charge is \u00a320 per night, then this is quite exorbitant and as some other reviewers have pointed out, you wouldn\u2019t really want to leave your car anywhere else but a secure place overnight. The internet charges are quite steep as well and I have seen these rise over the time I have stayed at the hotel. I now use a dongle as it\u2019s much easier, or failing that, your phone if it\u2019s just browsing that you\u2019re after. There is a convenience store over the road which has the basics of what you might need (they have had enough money from me over the months!), but if you are after something more then there is always the shopping centre opposite the bus station where there is a Sainsbury\u2019s and a Morrisons and a host of other shops. I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I am working on the East side of London as it\u2019s ideal. And if you do book in advance and can be fairly certain that your travel arrangements will not change, then you can pick up a room for about \u00a362.00 on an advance rate which I once did.

The Stratford train/tube/bus station is just 8-10 minutes away, 5 minutes if you walk lively. There is a small shopping mall just opposite to the station, and at the end of the year a huge mall will open right besides the station, so that will be great. so like i said, easy and quick access to any part of london, mind you, there is also a bus station right in front of the hotel, but i would not recommend you take the bus from the central area to the hotel, because it will be a 1 hour journey at least, so take the tube instead, much faster.

A trip including 2 nights in this hotel, which was reasonable priced for London standards. The hotel location is fair since the walking distance to Stratford station (Underground Julilee and Central line, DLR) and the Stratford shopping centre. During our stay a lot of construction works going on for the 2012 Olympics, but not nearby the hotel, it's closer to the station. The check-in was very good, since we got a room immediately (even before noon!). Maybe it helped since I am priority club member. The room was on the 4th floor and very spacious. The bed was just renewed (matress) I personally didn't find it comfortable for sleeping. Also the room to outside did not properly close, so the room had \"fresh\" air all the time. The bathroom was spacious also, showergel and shampoo is provided for, as well towels replaced every day. The only item to complain in the bathroom is the not so constant temperature of the warm water. During my showers, it was flucuating to \"very hot\" and \"ice cold\" and back to my desired temperature. It was frustrating, sometimes. Anyway we were in London for the town, not the hotel, so the rooms in this hotel are very well ok. I must ask your and the hotel's attention for the breakfast, through! It was located in a large room (size of 3 hotel rooms, walls removed) and very warm inside. Food was available in the hall, where some tables were positioned (see photo). Variaty of food was limited or out of stock, refills took too long. Another item which I didn't like was the WiFi internet which is charged for. Nowadays this should be very common. In several countries it's normal to find WiFi for free in bars and even 2* hotels. Why can't Holiday Inn (Express) not make such arrangements? Even if that needs to be charged for, raise your hotel room fare with GBP 0.50 per night to get out of the investment, instead of charging these high fares for just 30 minutes. I conclude that this hotel is convenient for shopping, quietly located in outer-London but easy to reach. Room spacious, breakfast not good.

Whilst we were at work, my colleague's room was emptied of her stuff, even though she was still checked in for another night. When she asked reception what had happened to it they said the maid must've removed t by mistake and it would be in lost property. After checking, it became apparent that all that was there was a pair of jeans - absolutely everything she brought with her had been stolen, either from the room by the maid, or from lost property. They even took her toothbrush and underwear. Reception were not apologetic or helpful at all - they said they didn't know who had cleaned the room and we would have to wait until the next day at 9am when the maids came in for work. I said this was not acceptable and the reception manager got very agitated. I asked him to provide a toothbrush, toothpaste and other necessities for my colleague from a machine in the reception with petty cash as it was the least he could do and he was rude and said no initially, until we asked him several times when he at last gave in. We had a lot of children staying in the hotel with us that night, almost 200 and the hotel were unable to cater for them. Becuase of the building work (they didn't tell us about) there was dining available in a conference room on the third floor. The food was served from the kitchen on the ground, pushed through the building site on a trolley wth clingfilm on top and brought up in a lift. It was cold and there was not enough to go round - the chef was constantly running up and downstairs to make more and we had a queue of hungry kids all the way down the corridoor for over an hour. The food provided was unacceptable, we had paid \u00a310 a head for a healthy meal and drink for the children but were told firstly that a drink was not included (even though we had paid for it) and it took four of us to demand that the children were at least served some fruit squash with their meal. THe 'healthy meal' was some inedible mince, chips and vegetables which were stll frozen in the centre - we know because we checked. Or, for the vegetarians, dry pasta with a scoop your own sauce that looked and tasted like cheap tomato soup, served in a bowl on the table so it went cold quickly and was not replaced throughout the servce. It was absolutely disgusting. Many of the kids went to bed hungry and some went out to buy pot noodles out of their own pocket. The previous night I was told that there was no vegetarian option and when I said to the reception manager \"what happens if one of the children is vegetarian?\" he replied simply \"then they shall not eat this evening, we have nothing for them\".

I was absolutely amazed to find that while there were multiple pay tv channels there was not even basic digital tv. The food was overpriced and of poor quality. My chicken ceasar salad (according to the menu with anchovy fillets and parmesan shavings - though I could find none!) was essentially bland overcooked chicken on a bowl of soggy iceberg lettuce swimming in ceasar dressing.

We arrived before midnight but felt apprehensive when the cab driver advised us to be extra careful - especially late at night. It wasn't the best of introductions to the area, but like most stations in busy cities, it did have a few dubious characters wandering around. But please remember this was only at the station itself, which is within easy reach of the hotel. The cab fare was approximately \u00a37.00 from the station to the hotel, so good value, especially when travelling with heavy cases late at night. But if you're not averse to the few dubious characters, it's easily walkable to the hotel and is also on a bus route - one stop from Stratford station. The check in was fine and we were allocated a top floor room overlooking the main and very busy road. This wasn't a problem to us as both lifts were working fine and even if you're a very light sleeper, the double glazing drowns out most of the noise. But if you like to sleep with the window open, it would be advisable to ask for a room on the other side. The room was large and clean, as was the bedding and the bathroom. No faults at all with the housekeeping - it was exemplary. The only minor negative point was a stain on the cover of the sofa but as we only used it to put bags on, it wasn't a problem. The bed tended to lean towards the middle, but was comfortable after a hectic day spent in London. The bathroom, which is in fact a shower room, was spotless, as were the towels. We always take our own toiletries but there are dispensers for hand and body wash near the sink and in the shower, and a vending machine near the foyer if you forget anything like toothpaste. The nearby shopping centre in Stratford should cover just about anything else you may need. As has been mentioned in previous reviews, there was no hot food available that weekend, but the receptionists are more than happy to order a take-away for you to eat in your room, providing it's not overly late. The take-away menus, although of limited choice, can be found near the vending machine, and one meal was ample to feed two of us, and at approximately \u00a310 including delivery, good value for London. The continental breakfasts are standard but adequate enough to start the day off. If, as we did, you find yourself slightly disorientated with the area, just ask. The girls on reception were a credit to the hotel, and if they couldn't immediately help with directions to various places, they Googled the areas and handed us printouts, which was a very kind and helpful gesture. I can't recommend highly enough the benefits of buying an Oyster card on your arrival in London, especially if you're staying for sight-seeing in London. These, topped up with \u00a330 each, was more than enough for us to traverse across the city and further, and to have credit available at the end of the stay. Much cheaper than taxis. There's a bus stop a couple of minutes away from the hotel, and it's only one stop to Stratford station. As it was a weekend, there were various disruptions due to works being carried out, but at no time did we find this a problem. There's alternative routes to be taken and the station staff were very helpful. If returning from London to Stratford, and need a bus to the hotel, go to platform C at the bus station and get on any red bus - it's as easy as that, and where your Oyster card comes in handy. It's also handy for the DLR and buses. Should you wish to travel out to Beckton to the smaller shopping outlets, it's one stop from the hotel to the station, and a bus (I think it was the 252 or 262 but please ask - the local people were also more than helpful) takes you directly to Beckton Triangle (with it's Next and Boots clearance stores) or Gallion's Reach shopping centre, and which takes under an hour. Overall, we were very happy with the hotel and the hotel staff. The only downside was the distance from the city to the hotel, especially if you need to return more than once in a day, (but who'd want to?) and the lack of cooked food at the weekend. If you prefer to travel by taxi to and from the hotel it might work out cheaper to book a Holiday Inn that's more central. If not, then I'd recommend this hotel if you're travelling by car, or for a long weekend providing you don't mind the DLR and frequent tube changes.. If we could have picked this hotel up, and dropped it to a place nearer the attractions, it would have been near perfect for our needs. Our stay cost us \u00a3159 for 3 nights B&B, but look around for any offers at the Holiday Inn site.

We arrived on New Year's Eve at around 12:00 and were allowed to check in, even though normal check in time starts at 2:00. We had requested a room at the back of the building (not facing the busy highway), but were told this information was not on their booking system. I found this rather peculiar since I had booked directly with the hotel website. In the end, the reception staff accommodated our request without too much persuasion. The room was clean and compact; no complaints. I did notice that instead of providing a complimentary shampoo/shaving cream/ sewing kit, etc. in the bedroom, you must now request it from staff. Cost cutting I suppose. Overnight, the room was quiet and we had a restful sleep (no outdoor noise or sounds from neighbouring rooms) - a real feat considering it was New Year's Eve! The one drawback to this hotel is its location in East London. It takes about 25 minutes to travel by underground to Westminster station (central London), plus approx 10-15 minutes to walk to the Stratford station. That said, I feel it is not unreasonable as long as you only take the trip once a day. However, if you like to do a bit of sightseeing and then come back to your room and relax before heading out again, you'll find this hotel's location inconvenient. Access to London via the Stratford station is flexible, with the Jubilee, Circle and DLR lines, as well as Overland trains operating from this station.
