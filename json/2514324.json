This hotel ticked both those boxes and we knew about the reviews so bit the bullet and booked it. On arrival we parked in the large car park which many London hotels do not have. There are steep steps that go up to the main reception area so those with buggies etc... may struggle. On arrival at reception we were met by a guy that must have been coming to the end of his shift as he really couldn't be bothered, but we checked in with no hassle and made our way to the 4th floor for our room. On arrive to the room which was a cluster of 4 rooms in a small lobby area, but strange but OK, we'll manage, we were pleasantly surprised. It was small, but clean, and the double bed, made out of two bed pushed together was huge and it didn't know it was two pushed together until closer inspection. The bathroom was clean but sadly in the morning we found the shower didn't work. We were in a rush so had to fill the bath quick and wash in the bath, not ideal but we managed. The bar is just off reception now and not down stairs as orginally thought. The bar is reasonably priced, \u00a37.50 for one and a half pints of lager, two halves of coke and two packets of crisps. Breakfast is as previously mentioned so I won't go in to detail. But if you are not happy with the offerings, there is a decent Wetherspoons 5 minutes away as well as some good cafes. You DON'T have to eat in the hotel! Sadly though the walls are partitions and thin so you know everything going on next door...litterally if you know what I mean. So much so the kids asked in the morning what all the noise was next door so we told them it was workmen working nights! Our room was a the front of the hotel so there was some road noise, but we were so tired it didn't bother us. Local to the area is Crystal Palace National Sports Stadium, Crystal Palace FC, shops, tubes to central London. The hotel is being renovated so they are working to put things right. It's not the Ritz but like I said, we needed a budget hotel in this part of London with parking and it worked for us. We knew what to expect and got it. You pay for what you get so if you are not happy with this hotel, pay more and stay in a higher grade hotel...simple! I would stay here again but would check the shower works first!

We parked in the last available space in the front car park, between 3 foreign coaches and some white vans, which was perhaps not a good sign, especially as there is a minicab company in the hotel basement. We were greeted at check in by a charming man who was at pains to tell us that we could park round the back of the hotel in a secure car park - breathed sigh of relief! What other reviewers have said about \"the labyrinth\" is indeed true, but there is no smell and the rooms are well signposted. I really could not understand the room numbering system, and thought that a room number beginning with 8 was going to be on the 8th floor. We went up and down several staircases on the way to our room, but the view from the window suggested that we were at first floor level. The building went up in 1854, and that is presumably how they did things then! The room was small and clean with a very effective radiator, but unfortunately the bathroom was very cold as it had no heating at all, which is not good when it is -5 outside. In general, the building is suffering from a lack of basic maintenance, and a bit more carpet vacuuming would not be out of place. Breakfast (included) is provided in one of the many function rooms in the basement and consists of juice, cornflakes, preserves and freshly made toast (not do it yourself) and a choice of hot drinks. It may not be full English, but it starts the day. On leaving, we were really pleased with how difficult it was to remove our car - thieves would have no chance.

After arriving on a very early flight from Vancouver, we were made to wait 8 hours for a room. When we eventually got our room, we believed they had cleared out a storage cupboard and put us in there. The floor wasnt flat and tilted downwards. There was holes in the wall. The room was small and dirty. The furniture was falling apart. We complained, and were shown a room with bunk beds! My boyfriend and I were really hoping for something a little more adult - not to mention the room looked like a prison cell. After more arguing, we were taken through a rabbit warren of corridors down to the 'dungeon room'. It had no windows, and we felt as though we were miles underground. The 4th room appeared ok at first glance and we agreed to take it. We changed out of our traveling clothes got ready to take a shower only to find mould all over the bathroom ceiling after pulling the shower curtain back. We also discovered the window wouldnt lock, and had a big crack through it (not safe at all). We then trudged back to the reception in our pyjamas and argued with the manager for another hour. Eventually he showed us a superior room - it was like night and day. The room was big and spacious and clean!!! I said 'we'll take it'. He told us there would be an extra charge per night. I told him that I would not pay the extra, and after more arguing he eventually agreed to let us have it. The rooms they show online are of the superior rooms, and the cheap rooms they sell online are the ones I have detailed above. BEWARE and fight for a better room.

The room that we got was on the 2nd floor, but due to the nature of the building, our room was not accessible by the lifts. We had to get there via a narrow flight of stairs, with an emergency door along the way. The worst thing was that I had a heavy suitcase with me, and thus I had to lug it all the way up the stairs! The room was small (not that we didn't expect that anyway, this being a budget hotel after all), although they still managed to fit in a queen-sized bed, and they even provide coffee and tea facilities. We had some problems with the bathroom though, as we had to let the water run for at least 10 minutes after turning on the heater before the water starts getting warm. Overall, I would recommend this hotel only if you have light luggage, not only because of the room locations as described above, but also the location of the hotel itself (it takes a 10 to 15 mins walk from the train station).

Our cell was at the end of a narrow corridor, and the window looked generously out to the brick wall 4 feet away. the shabby curtains were unnecessary as there was no natural light whatsoever. Two single beds (despite booking a double), were crammed in, and you had to climb over a desk to get into the bathroom. Quite why a desk is in this room is a mystery. A learning zone this is not, and you'd have to squeeze your legs over the bed to sit at the desk. You have to stand on the bed to see half of yourself in the bathroom mirror over the sink. The only light is the main 100 watt overhead light. And you had to switch that on at 9.00 am due to no natural light anyway. On our return from our night out, we returned to no electricity and no heating. it was freezing. Using the light from my mobile phone I located the room phone (that was a plus..) and dialled reception to get help. A man eventually arrived having strolled down the labyrinthine corridors with an ambivalence which belied that this had never happened before.. He asked for the chair from the room to stand on to untrip the switch. Job done. Waking up there was like never waking at all. We had no idea the sun shone that morning. The trip to the 5th floor in a postage stamp sized lift clearly unfit for the 100's of hapless and depressed looking guests filled me with no hope. The breakfast room was packed, and the tables were stacked with dirty dishes no doubt from long departed guests. The continental breakfast comprised of cornflakes and barely toasted toast and jam. The staff stood inert grinning vacantly at everyone. It was like a scene from One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest. You had to stand around clutching your breakfast awkwardly while peering around for two chairs together to enjoy breakfast 'a duex'. Only those who know how to nab a seat on a tube train at breakneck speed were successful in thier mission. The view from the 5th floor is the ONLY redeeming feature, though I'd lost the will to live by that point, and seriously considered throwing myself over the edge.. They probably wouldn't have got round to cleaning up the mess for a while anyway, so I thought against it. There is budget, there is bargain bucket, and then there is The Queens Hotel with such an incongruous name with added hilarity in naming rooms 'The Buckingham or Balmoral Suite' to add to its allure.

We weren't told what floor we were on but a moody couple who were in our lift told us it was the first floor. we wandered along the first floor corridor and holding our breath walked into what can only be described as a cheap hotel room they'd have in a terrible porno. There was semen on the curtains, a huge hole in the wall, a dirty, repulsive bathroom, a burnt iron print on the carpet, no plug for the sink, a rubbishly tiled shower, and a toilet full of un-flushed toilet roll. Worst of all though where the rooms obviously once connected the door frame was filled by a piece of MDF not quite big enough for the hole so there was quite a sizeable gap at the bottom. We sat there for a little while on the only sort of clean thing in the room, the bedspread, and stared around mortified. Determined not to let it ruin our trip we set out to find somewhere to have dinner. Having seen a sign for the hotel restaurant we diced to take a ride in the lift up to the 5th floor. Upon getting there we were confused. there was a big white table in front of us and looking into the only other room available there were a few tables scattered around with a few older people sat there with a big plate of biscuits. There was nowhere to order food that we could see and there were tables that looked like buffet tables around the edges with tea and coffee dispensers and more biscuits. Bizarre to say the least. So we ran off to the nearest Wetherspoons instead.

Instead of a twin it was a room with two sets of bunk beds. One set seperated as twins. The built up set was so old that the frames were very rusty. There was on one electric socket in the room, which meant you had to unplug the television to make a cup of tea. The television set was very old and only had a set top aerial which provided a very poor picture, which became intolerable to watch. The room was dirty and this standard of cleanliness is disgusting when you have paid \u00a359 this is not anything close to value for money. The shower head continually fell off when you tried to adjust it to enable the water to wash your body and had to be removed from the fitting as it was installed at such a low height you had almost kneel down to get under the head.

I complained to my office following the first nights stay explaining that reception advised us they had no other rooms to move us to and they contacted the Euro Group immediately who advised they needed to request on online refund form from the Group Manager, this never arrived and following a reply to our first email requesting this on the 26.07.11 (the morning after the first nights stay) from the Group Manager advising he would look into it, there was no further response. My office contacted him again on the 15.08.11, requesting the online refund form again, but no form or reply was recieved until the 06.09.11. Unfortunately it was not the response hoped for. The hotel staff lied and said they had'nt received any complaint, they then contradicted themselves by saying they had moved us to another room, this was also not true as the night we moved to another room was for a seperate booking for an additional 4th (due to work commitments) night via Laterooms.com and not connected at all to the first booking.

Anyway, it was late and we needed somewhere to stay so I said I will take the room after checking it. The receptionist then asked me to bring my partner into the room to so that we could check it together. I replied by saying that I can check the room myself, my partner trusts my judgement. The receptionist then gets on his walky talky and calls for another member of staff who proceeds to tell me that he will not show me the room unless I 'show' him my partner. I asked him what this was all about. He then proceeded to tell me that when girls book rooms, then invite men into the rooms there is trouble and then the police have to be called. Of course I was not only offended by this (being a 31-year-old professional women) but absolutely astonished that a hotel that is meant to be provided a service felt that it was acceptable to act this way. I went back to the car and told my partner the situation and advised him that I did not want to stay at this hotel because I did not like their attitude or what they were implying but because he was so tired he said we should go and atleast look at the room.

The hotel is outdated and needs an emergency makeover internally and a social skills course for the staff. On arriving at the hotel we were given a room which to find seemed like an episode of the cryptum factor! The room was in the basement with a shower that a homeless person would think twice about using and general decor that was depressing. We had to tune the TV in and there was a fire exit door outside our room that wasn't locked and could be opened from the inside and outside. When we challenged the reception staff they told me that i was lying and there was no way that the door could be opened from the outside, trust me a trained monkey could open that door and on that point would make a better fist of the role on reception than the sarcastic and surly middle aged Asian gentleman i spoke to who in my opinion is a disgrace and should be fired. I was not alone in complaining, in fact in the 10 minutes i waited at reception there were 4 other guest that came up and complained about a wide range of issues and some refused to stay and left. In hindsight we should of done the same. The beds were dirty and i think staying at a youth hostel would of been a better choice! There was loud music played until 2am so not much sleep was had. What i would say is that even though i have stayed in 5 star hotels before, i did not expect this to be a 5 star, in fact i had prepared myself for a 3 star hotel. In my opinion this hotel if inspected would struggle to achieve above one star. I'm not the type of person to review anything i buy but i feel so strongly about this hotel i had to write my feelings down, hopefully to persuade people like me who though 'well it's cheap, i can put up with anything for one night!' not to stay here. The guests are mainly tourists and that is the worst thing, this hotel is unfortunately an ambassador for the UK and i'm ashamed that people visiting the UK stay here, what impression is that giving to them of us in the UK. To the management of the hotel and the general manager who i was told to see the next morning and the only person who could deal with the complaints. All i can say to you is you must be very busy dealing with complaints and either you, your line manager or the owners of this establishment need to wake up and see that the 'hotel' you 'run' is a disgrace and i would be shocked if this is not closed down when inspected next.

Don't get me started on 'service' as reception were incapable of checking us in quickly and got into several heated arguments about the booking as it was not what we had booked, and you can not expect a 6'7 man to sleep in a 5'4 bunkbed with raised bars at both ends. Hotel staff were not understanding, congenial, pleasant or helpful. TIP - if you are car parking, get a permit from reception as they clamp cars.

I was soothed to sleep by the gentle banging coming from the nearest stairwell and the overture of the local emergency services. The morning chorus was much the same. After morning ablutions and discovering that the toilet seat was a balancing act I went in search of breakfast, so it was from first floor to reception where I was greeted by hoards of children on some kind of outing but no sign of breakfast or staff on reception. So i followed a sign for a dining suite only to find a short, dead end corridor so back to reception and down to the balmoral suite where i found more children having their breakfast but no adult guests, so... back to reception.

There were (what looked to be) pubic hairs on the side bed table, open packets of used shampoo in the shower, holes in the walls, and not vacuumed. Oh yes, there were large boogers smeared on one wall. My wife and I were very tired so decided to deal with it for the night and change rooms in the morning.

On our way out, we told the staff about the dirty room and I overheard the front desk radio the cleaning service informing them to clean our room. Hours later we arrived to our hotel and realized that the room was in the same condition. I returned to the front desk and spoke with the \"night manager.\" He said the cleaning staff had already left for the night. So I asked for another room, which he replied they were all booked and could not give us another room.

The walls are very thin and our room was located under stairs. We returned to the front desk and talked to the \"night manager\" who informed us of the number for German teenagers who recently arrived and were causing a lot of grief for other hotel guests. At midnight, I had enough of the hotel service staff who were not doing their jobs. I ended up loosing my temper among a group of teenagers running around the halls which finally awoke the German student's chaperone.

Found Euro Hotel in Clapham for 69 pounds thru booking.com. When arrived to the place at 6 pm on the day of my stay, they said \"we don't have it\" when I presented my confirmed reservation. The receptionist made arrangements, called a cab and transferred me to Queens. They refunded the cab, charged the balance (52 quid) for the room. The door to the room was not closed - it turned out it had to be slammed to close (later that night, a neighbouring group of some Scandinavian youngsters had been testing the idea till 3 am and then again, from 6 am). I lost more than an hour for transfer, had to take a cab to O2, arriving 20 minutes late for the show which was the sole purpose of my flight to London. I'm giving the whole story as it seems that that \"no booking/transfer to a better hotel\" story has happened to other people, too. The hotel itself is 10-15 minutes of brisk walk from Crystal Palace overground station. It's shabby interior and an unpleasant room made me want to get out there as soon as possible.. In essence, I got what I paid for, given the availability of hotel rooms in London at that time, but the real value of my room was closer to 20 pounds.

I booked a single room with ensuite. On checking in I was informed my room was on the sixth floor. However, once in the lift I found it only went up to floor 5. After trying in vain to find the sixth floor via the stairs I lugged my bags back down to reception to be told by the girl that it was her first day - there is no sixth floor. Another member of staff waved vaguely in the opposite direction and blatantly ignored my attempts to wander around finding my room. I eventually found it via the billiard room, down a flight of stairs in the paint peeling, disgusting basement. My single room turned out to be full of cramped bunkbeds - apparently it could sleep six. Honestly I have seen better homeless shelters. I feared to walk on the filthy bathroom floor for fear of what I might catch. I sculpted a bath plug out of a bar of soap as by then I felt adamant that they were not going to win! The bedding was clean, but the room very basic. I didn't bother to try plugging the TV in to see if it worked. I found the phone under one of the bunkbeds, completely inaccessible. Of course, I had no reception on my phone either as the room was in the basement. I tried asking the reception for a taxi later that night but was told to go next door. I found the taxi office but had to totter down some steep steps in my high heels and felt they could have rung them for me as the cars were parked in the hotel complex. The next morning I found the restaurant only because I had seen floor five whilst trying to locate my room the day before. No-one had given any information about where and what time breakfast was. Although my booking promised 'english breakfast' my request was dismissed with contempt, and I was handed two pieces of toast. I tried to get a hot chocolate from the machine but was told that it wasn't working. The coffee provided was so awful I couldn't drink it and had to wash my mouth out afterwards to get rid of the taste - I couldn't decide if it was the chemicals the cup had been washed in or just very cheap. I didn't like to think what might have been running round the room during the night. The next morning some half eaten pieces of toast were strewn around the billiard room, along with piles of dirty rags/curtains. I didn't expect luxury for the price, but did expect helpful staff and a certain level of cleanliness, and for the food to at least be edible. This is truly one of the worst hotels I have ever experienced.

Breakfast time and we were instructed by staff upon arrval that it is situated on the top floor - two dispensers of cornflakes and milk, a tray of bread slices with a toaster in the corner, two vending machines preapring coffee, tea and hot chocolate were placed on tables in one corner, cooked breakfasts were available if you could actually find a member of staff but then again if you're English speaking there will be a considerable language barrier. Cheap tablecloths on cheap tables surrounded with a view of cracked plaster on walls, punched holes in doors and a dirty floor - not what you want a breakfast time. It is a clear indication that this room had not been prepared for a guest but reset to it's basic format for a lodger . Such a disappointment from what you expect when you arrive and see the outside shell of an impressive Victorian built hotel - the complete interior does not live up to the advertisement it shows. I can only think that this is a hotel that leans itself towards housing the people on social benefit and tries to squeeze as many in as possible to get the maximum amount of money out whilst putting the last amount of effort in.", "Date": "December 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFar from perfect, but well worth the price\u201d", "Author": "Lilycow", "ReviewID": "UR88974295", "Content": "I am extremely glad to have taken the risk to book this hotel for my week-long stay despite having read an abundance of poor reviews. In my opinion, most of these bad reviews are written by people with too-high expectations of what spending \u00a340-\u00a350 per night for a hotel in London will get you. The staff are extremely polite and always happy to help. The hotel in general, though aged, is cosy and the bar is well-stocked. The room itself, though I booked a double, actually had one double bed and one single bed, though this was not much of a problem at all. The room was absolutely clean but very rough around the edges - wallpaper was peeling behind the radiator and fixtures and fittings, though well taken care of, were showing signs of age (particularly the taps, which were hard to turn on and off!). Breakfast is served on the fifth floor with a gorgeous view over London which, in my case, was beautifully snow-covered for most of my stay. Breakfast, for those who haven't paid for the Full English, is very basic: toast, cereal, juice and tea/coffee. However, the Full English is freshly-cooked and extremely satisfying and costs an extra \u00a35.00 should you choose to have it. I booked through Booking.com, which said that my booking included a Full English breakfast in the room rate; when the staff attempted to charge us an extra \u00a35.00 for it, we simply showed them the print-out of our booking confirmation and that was that for the rest of our stay. The location is, on a normal day, pretty good: it's a five minute walk to Westow Hill which is lined with restaurants (I recommend Joanna's) and a twenty minute walk or two minute bus journey to Crystal Palace station with direct trains to London Victoria. Overall, the hotel is basic and not luxurious, but you could do much, much worse for the price - places like Crystal Palace Towers (nextdoor) and Astra Palace charge similar prices for rooms and service which do not meet the standards of Queens Hotel. For those complaining about the lack of room service and perfect decor should look into spending \u00a320 a night more at a hotel chain - this is LONDON after all!", "Date": "December 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland", "Title": "\u201cSurprised- Very Good Value for money\u201d", "Author": "Stewie15", "ReviewID": "UR87886374", "Content": "Working nearby, chose here.

I used to live in Crystal Palace so I know the area very well. I read the reviews for this hotel (which were pretty bad) but it was cheap and I wanted a night out in London so I booked this hotel all the same. Although I had very low expectations given the previous reviews I was shocked by the state of this hotel. I paid \u00a339 for a single room (which is very cheap for London) and I still feel that I have been ripped off. The Room The room was effectively in a basement, bars across the windows, no furniture in the room and generally very run down and depressing. There was a small TV in the room with 4 channels but the remote control didn't work and the tiny areal on top of the TV had a very poor reception. There were holes in the carpets and a single hand towel which was supposed to double up as a bath towel. I was given two very small sachets of shampoo which was nowhere near adequate. The bed had a single sheet for a duvet, and the walls were so thin that when someone walked down the corridor outside my room, my whole bed would literally vibrate. I'm NOT a light sleeper but this still kept me awake all night. I don't think it was just my room, other reviewers have also commented on this. The only way to describe or compare the room and the general condition of the hotel is something similar to the horror hotel programmes you see on TV. I need to point out that I have stayed in hotels and hostels all over the world and this is by far the worst I have ever stayed in. However I did say that I would provide an honest and accurate review, so the three good things about this hotel is the location, as it's near 2 train stations (Gipsy Hill and Crystal Palace) and it's on the night bus route if you want a night out in London. Secondly my room did have hot water, and finally it does have free parking which not many hotels in London offer. Breakfast Breakfast is included in the price, however this simply consists of toast (white bread only) and a couple choices of cereal. The orange juice was so watered down it barely resembled orange juice. It certainly shouldn't sway your decision to stay here, Crystal Palace does have some nice cafes which serve good breakfast. My Recommendation Like I said, I used to live in Crystal Palace so I know the area very well. My recommendation is to stay at the Jury's Inn hotel in Croydon (approx 3 miles away). On average it's about \u00a310 more but it's definitely worth it. Don't worry I don't work for the hotel :-), but it's in an excellent location in terms of transport links into London, it's opposite a shopping centre and the rooms and breakfast are far superior. The only downside is that you do have to pay for parking, but if you arrive after 6pm you only need to pay \u00a33.

First impressions of the hotel were fine, when we arrived at the hotel the staff were friendly, we were given our room and key card straight away. We then had a long trek through the maze of corridoors and stairs (i can only describe the decor as 'the shining' like) when we eventually got to our room all seemed fine, but the problems were yet to start. Apparently our room shared a wall with a busy corridoor which shook everytime someone walked passed, the kettle in our room was broken, the mattress was stained, there was mould on the lamps, there was dubious white stains on the chair, the shower was unable to keep constant temperature, the curtains were hanging off, there was no wardrobe, the 'double' bed was two singe beds pushed together and there was no room service or wake up call service (unlike we were promised when booking the hotel). But honestly, this was nothing in comparison to what we hd in store for us. In the morning we were awoken by a dripping noise, assuming it was from a neighbouring room we ignored it and went for our 'continental' breakfast (which included stale bread you had to toast yourself, a large tub of cornflakes, in which i did witness a man cough into while serving himself some, and tea and coffee, but there were no cups so we were unable to have any) so hastily leaving the breakfast area hungry and thirsty, we went back to our room to pack our things, only to find the dripping noise we had head earlier was the sound of our ceiling leaking water onto the table and nearby plug socket. Phoning reception, i asked for someone to be sent down immediately to assess the problem. Half an hour went by and still no one had arrived, and the leak was getting much worse and a large crack was now appearing in the ceiling. I phoned reception again and was told to \"stop being silly, and someone was on their way\" very ubruptly and rudely. When someone finally turned up, we recieved no appology and were simply told to ''get out of the room\". On checking out, feeling angry about the service, hotel room, and attitude from staff, i made a complaint, only to be told there was nothing they could do about it and we were given no appology.

I was fully aware that the budget rate was not going to buy me anything but basic facilities and was fine with that - a blanket, pillow and mattress was enough. However, arriving at 11.30pm I was made to wait 30 minutes while they found my reservation, which they had lost, in a lobby full of fairly annebriated groups of men. I was then informed that there wasn't a key available for my room, and so would have to be let into my room by a porter who had a master key. Already feeling very nervous, I was then asked, twice, if I was expecting any 'gentlemen visitors'... pretty terrifying! Can I just clarify here that I was wearing jeans and a wooly jumper, and I thought looked fairly normal, and am not used to being mistaken for 'a lady of the night'. I was then lead by a porter , along with another annoyed customer who had also been told that there were no keys for the rooms, through a maze of corridors to find that the 'single room' that I had booked was in fact a 4 bed room, comprising of two hospital style single beds and a pair of bunk beds... bizarre! Thanking god I had actually reached my room alive (the other hotel guest who had been shown his room at the same time had already asked if I would prefer to join him instead - argh!), I was then given a lecture in broken english from the porter that if I was expecting any 'mr's' to join me I really did have to tell reception otherwise there were always fights... kind of speechless after this, I just thanked him and (I have never done this before), locked the door from the inside and dragged a chair from the room to lodge against the handle.

Breakfast was not good. I, like the rest of my colleagues and numerous other guests, had arrived downstairs only to be told that breakfast was in fact being served on the top floor of the hotel. It probably wasn't worth the effort to get there. It consisted of a rather poor selection of continental style offerings, with an optional extra \u00a34.95 payable for a cooked alternative. I waited for the inattentive waiter to leave the room, and then simply helped myself without paying. My guilt was purged by the fact that I only managed one or two mouthfuls before returning to the sanctuary of the cereals.

Get out at Gypsy Hill Station and exit. You will see a Shell fuel station. Keep the way through up (up not down). Go straight. 10 miniutes later you will see the hotel. People are helpful, you can ask them where is this hotel if you think that you are lost. Its only 20 minutes to Victoria station and so easy to arrive there. There are also night busses from front of hotel to London city center all night long. Its safe and quite area. Well it was really nice hotel. Dont expect too much. Nice and clean room, lcd tv, boiler, hair dryer, comfortable bed, good working central heating system, simple breakfast, wireless internet.. Also, there are two computers for internet access near reception. 1 pound for 10 minutes:). Good for check mails. Lobby bar is Ok. Prices are not high for drinks. Everything was very simple but enough.

On walking into the crowded reception we were pleasantly suprised. After waiting about 20mins to get to the desk the receptionist tried to check us in. We were half way through when a very very rude and unimpressed customer came and threw his weight around so we had to wait another few minutes while another member of staff tried to sort him out. We eventually got to our rooms or in this case more like army barracks but minus the cleanliness.The bedding seemed clean but that was the only bonus of the room. The next morning we went up to enjoy our 'Continental breakfast'... I use that phrase losely! It was really funny. A whole crowd of people waiting in line to make their toast on the single toaster (there was another one but it didn't work). The rest of breakfast was jam and butter and a variety of cereal. There was also a choice of coffee, tea and some juice. My sister had some apple juice which must have been diluted 1 part apple juice to 3 parts water. Yuck! After joining another couple on one of the remaining big tables and having some toast and butter, I decided to have a cup of coffee. I was just about to pour the milk into my cup when very rude waitor told me that the buffet area was closing, so I nodded and said 'okay' and continued pouring my milk, he then repeated himself more forcefully this time... I was gob smacked... and started laughing, I mean, what do you do when someone says that and you are already retreating from the table. I should have just put my coffee down and walked away maybe? It was absolutely hilarious!!! When we went back to the rooms, my friends card wouldn't work so she went back down to the reception to get it sorted out. Guess who came rushing through throwing his toys again... the same man from the day before. Anyway, we were really glad to be out of there. I looked at the photos of the hotel again and laughed some more... The pictures are NOTHING like the rooms we got.

Room very basic, worktop not finished, no remote on TV, very little hanging space considering room had a double and a single bed.

Water was very hot (not a complaint). On using the over-bath shower, the shower head assembly came apart - this must have been noticeable when the room was serviced, but we had to ask at reception to get it sorted, which it was when we returned the following day. No grab rails on bath or wall - an accident waiting to happen. We only went up to the 5th floor breakfast room once and that was too often. Breakfast was very limited - a few cereals or prunes, tea, coffee and bread for toasting. Fruit juice was available - we tried, and left, the apple juice which was very diluted, and tasted of very little.

To all outward appearances, it seemed a pleasant enough place, although the Reception staff weren't overly eager to please or make their guests feel welcome. I felt that the Receptionist was over-worked and under seige from some of my fellow guests at the time I arrived, so I gave her the benefit of the doubt. The room appeared ok, a bit shabby but it had everything I needed. The electrics were definitely dodgy, with sockets hanging off the wall, so I was very glad I didn't have any young children staying with me. The curtains were ugly, but covered the window adequately. The bedding could have done with a hot wash in Vanish to shift the well set staining! However the bed was comfy and that's really all you need. All in all, I felt relieved that the place really wasn't too bad. I have to report though that my relief was very short-lived! I spent a dreadful night in that place. The noise from the nearby Games Room was horrendous and I suspect the guests in the room above were rearranging the furniture from 2am til 5.30! Having had precious little sleep, I was finally flooded out of my bed at 7am! I can only surmise the guests in the room directly above mine had flooded their bath and the water cascaded through my ceiling light fitting straight on to my bed. They obviously had a functioning bath plug in their room, which was more than could be said for mine! (No bath plug. I had to use the top off a milk carton, being a resourceful girl! The shower didn't work.) I immediately reported my distress to the duty Receptionist. ( I had to walk to Reception, as there was no phone in the room) who said he \"would send someone\". I sat in the near dark, couldn't have the light on as there was the obvious hazard of water and electricity, for 2 hours. Nobody came! In the end, I gave up hope of any help and went to breakfast ( basic, but ok) and completed a Complaints Form. Nobody has contacted me to apologise for what happened, which is frankly infuriating.

We were advised on booking that the hotel was under refurbishment and that we would be staying in the newly refurbished rooms, only one of the rooms out of the five had been refurbished. On arrival, they asked for payment upfront, on reflection the warning bells should have rung then. Our rooms were in different parts of the hotel not together as we would have liked, my partner and I was put in the basement which was uncomfortabley warm. The room was tiny, to the point that we couldn't move around it at the same time. It also had one small window in the corner therefore making it very dark. There were stains/marks on the walls and celling which were disgusting and we couldn't tune the tv in properly. The first night the toilet cistern would not fill up properly and was running like a tap all night which kept me awake. I got up early the next morning to have a shower, which was cold. When I went to the reception desk to tell them about the shower they said there was a problem with the boilers, something that I had realised myself during my cold shower. I also informed them of the noisy toilet to which they said they would have someone from maintenance look at it in 10 minutes, I did not see anyone from maintenance, they must have fixed it while we were out at the wedding. The boiler was fixed later that morning but that was too late for me as I had an appointment with they hairdresser and had to be ready early. Breakfast was included in the fee, however I would not have eaten there if it had been the last restaurant on Earth, the rooms had dirty walls so god know what the kitchen would have been like! My pregnant step-sister had the delight of not being able to open the window in her room as the kitchen staff had put chicken outside to rot right by her window which smelt terrible. She asked them to move it which they didn't, so as a results only opened the window as she left which would have been a nice smell for the cleaners, maybe they would have done something about it then. She also did not have a plug in her bath, therefore having to improvise. My 85 year old Grandmother also did not have a plug in her sink which she found very inconvenient .

My key card wouldn't work but after trying three times someone seemingly inside the room asked who was there. I knocked and the door opened and I was greeted by a member of staf muttering something about he thought that room was not being allocated or something like that so he asked me to wait and helpfully went to reception. That seemed to get sorted and he came back and I was able to open the door and get installed.

However, the day before I was due to check in I rang to confirm I could have an early check in (they won't normally check in before 3pm, even though check out is at 11am) as the wedding was at 3. They'd lost my booking!!!! After a brief discussion with an incredibly unhelpful manager, and me having to email them a copy of my reservation confirmation, they called me back with my reservation number, and reluctantly confirmed I could check in from 1pm. On arrival at the hotel at 1.15 we were initially told no rooms were ready, but then they miraculously found a room that was. We were given directions on how to find it, but were not warned about the obstacle course we'd have to pass to reach it!!! Very poorly lit corridors, with unmarked slopes in the floor and unmarked steps resulted in me tripping and bashing my arm on a wall. When we eventually found the room, it had 3 single beds, when I'd booked a double bed. So back we went to reception. Guess what.... they don't have an accident book, and I couldn't see any details regarding their public liability insurance displayed anywhere. Despite this, I made a written statement about the accident, the receptionist signed it and I was given a copy, being assured the Security Officer would record details of the accident in the appropriate records. Personally, I'm not convinced this will happen. Although the receptionist was as helpful as she could be, it was clear the manager really didn't give a damn about his patrons - we overheard him telling the desk staff that he didn't care whether there were weddings going on, check in was at 3pm and not before, and it was tough if there weren't rooms ready when geusts arrived. Well anyway, we're now nearing 2pm - just about the time we needed to get the taxi to the wedding venue - and we're finally given what was described as 'a lovely room'. Yes it was clean, yes it was a double, but was it 'lovely'?... not as far as I am concerned! The room was at the front of the hotel, which faces onto a very busy road, and the windows were not even double glazed. The bathroom was functional at best - the plug hole in the sink was full of hairs, and the paint was peeling off, where the bathroom was quite clearly damp. Needless to say we did not spend more time than necessary in the room, choosing only to sleep in there, and we waited until we'd got home this morning to shower! My sister - the bride - suffered a similar, yet perhaps worse experience.

We asked for advice for getting into London and were advised that the number 3 bus goes straight into the centre of London, and were told where the bus stop was (about half a mile walk away).

It was clean and very tidy, the bed was ENORMOUS and comfortable. The bathroom was nicely finished, tiled all over. The hot water took a little while to come through & perhaps the shower curtain rail was a little rusty but having said that I've seen worse rooms costing far more. The inclusive continental breakfast was a choice of cereals, fruit juices, toast, jams, ham and cheese, tea and coffee. (We award brownie points to anyone who finds room 730 without assistance.) The bedding was changed for the second day (though we were only staying two nights), and the towels we used were replaced for clean. Disappointing that the milk on the tea/coffee tray in the room weren't topped up. Masses of power points in the room and the tv was pretty good. You do have to re-validate the room card every day to be able to access the room again, but that wasn't a problem. All the staff we saw and dealt with were really polite, I'd almost call them charming. All in all a very good 9 out of 10, and 10 out of 10 for sheer value.

We waited for half an hour and then asked them to please give us the room we booked 7 months ago because we were very tired. We soon found out that the staff there barely speaks English!

Instead of having a toast machine you had ot ask a guy for toast he then had to walk into the kitchen to get it for you each time someone asked! this made it take ages to get anything. There was no cereal bows or cups left and rather than them keeping it all topped up with juice, bowls etc they waited til you asked them, then took ages to get anything! The toast was like warm floppy bread and the milk was warm. I wouldnt reccomend this place to anyone, i would rather pay an extra \u00a320 and stay in a nice clan Premier Travel Inn.", "Date": "June 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "LONDON", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Dreadful!

Given London is a vastly overpriced [--] the 'bargain' of \u00a336 for a double room seemed quite reasonable. The reception part looks fine the rooms not so. On arrival we checked it to find a filthy room that had stains on the floor, goodness knows what these stains were. There was a kettle so we were going to make a brew after a long trip down only to find the kettle was full of limescale and there was lipstick on the cups. This put us off our morning meal. The room was in need of a major refurbishment as the wallpaper which was left was falling of the walls, the TV didn't work and the light fittings above our heads were dangling off. The bed linen had holes in and there were a few springs missing from our mattress. The radiator couldn't be turned off and remained on full all night. The bathroom is just a joke, the taps needed turning in a vice to be turned off (you'd would have to avoid the grime that was under them first). The shower was hot though the holder was broken and also leaked through the shower curtain flooding the bathroom. Tiles were also broken. I asked for the manager at midnight though apparantly there was no manager on duty. I couldn't be arsed going any further. Generally the whole place is a shambles. We made the mistake of going cheap and not checking websites like this one before hand. Pay that little bit extra if your going to London avoid this place like the plague.", "Date": "February 26, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Queens Hotel Crystal Palace", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d189740-Reviews-Queens_Hotel_Crystal_Palace-London_England.html", "Price": "$52 - $109*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">122 Church Rd</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Crystal Palace</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">SE19 2UG</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514324", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/31/90/3190e8633e291e8b41582a936a22a34a5large.jpg"}}
