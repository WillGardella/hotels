Hotel has been recently refurbished and is clean and tidy. Also relatively cheap by London standrads. Unfortunately it is let down by the details. The Hotel was hard to spot while driving because they only had a laminated sheet with their name on the front door. The room was OK. Neat and clean but fairly sparse. The bathroom was tiny!. I had trouble fitting into the shower alcove and if I dropped the soap I had to open the door to be able to bend down to retrieve it. And worst of all the water temperature was erratic and impossible to regulate. It went from boiling hot to freezing cold with only a minor adjustment of the control. And that is really frustrating and, in fact painful, when in a shower alcove that is so small.

I could hear a guy snoring on the other side of the corridor two doors up and if anybody walked down the corridors the floor creaked so much it sounded like it was going to go through. It's an ok place, the beds were ok, typical economy hotel pillows were like sheets of A4 placed on the bed and you have to trek out of the back door and across a car park to get to breakfast in the morning.

Our first rooms bathroom was filthy! Covered in mold and mildew, and smelled like urine. My boyfriend went to the front desk to see about a different room; the male receptionist was insanely rude, accusing my BF of being drunk (not so) and threatening to call the police! We were given the option to change rooms, which we did, but the 2nd was no better. The T.V didn't really work, the shower head was cracked so the water gushed out like a garden hose. The window was stuck half way open, wouldn't close. The main entrance door lock was screwed up, sometimes it took 10 minutes of jiggling it to enter the building. The electrical outlets in the room only worked occasionaly. The guest towels were stored on the nasty floor in the hall downstairs. They wanted guest to leave their room key at the front desk each time you left the hotel! Once again, do not let the website pics fool you...the front of the hotel doesn't even look like the web pic! The only positive point of the motel is its location. Easy walk to tube, buses, train.

The floorboards and both in the room and in the hall outside were creaky and noisy as heck. I could almost handle that too. The real problem was that the room was filthy! The carpet looked like it was brushed, not vacuumed. The walls were stained. The bathroom was a real cess-pit; the shower fittings had rusted and were just left there, the sink was corroded and I found a toe-nail clipping on the floor. As I said, I can handle a few issues with a hotel, I\u2019m certainly not fussy, but when things are so dirty that it makes my skin crawl, something is very wrong. A couple of other little things annoyed me. The blinds were not long enough to cover the window, and likewise the shower curtain. Indeed, with the calcified shower head spraying water in all directions, it was difficult to take a shower without covering the whole bathroom in water. Maybe once the renovations are complete, the Pembury might be a hotel worth visiting. But for now, it is disgraceful that they are charging (decent) money to stay in such run-down, uncared for rooms.

With the help of booking agent and over the telephone, the hotel staff were told to sort this out. I was directed to an apartment that was part of the Park Hotel, which was behind the Pembury, and clearly belonging to the same people as the Pembury. Apartment is not the word to be used. This so called apartment was up a street that I would not walk down, alone on a dark night, it was in fact somebody house.

There's a TV which was also tiny and had the channels mixed up and there was also a kettle there with tea bags, coffee, sugar etc etc. I never used it though, christ knows how long the milk might have been there! The beds were comfortable enough and i did sleep preety well. The bathroom was tiny but clean. The sink was a hand basin and the shower, even the smallest of people would have trouble standing under the jet, not good for a 6 footer! The worst thing about the bathroom was the cold tap ran hot so there was no cold water and also no warning. The 'cold' icon on top of the tap had been removed so it was impossible to even have a wash!
