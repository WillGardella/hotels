I have seen some reviews here saying that the hotel is close to The Strip, that's wrong, the hotel is NOT close to The Strip, those people are reviewing another La Quinta hotel that is located north of the airport. The hotel is very quiet, very family friendly specially for people that don't want to expose children to casinos and gambling and also excellent for business trips. Keep in mind that it is located in a business area so there are only a few places around to buy something to eat (7/11, Taco bell, Mc Donalds and a couple more), there is food delivery available but I could only see Pizza delivery. The hotel also provides with free WiFi and wired internet, and a free business center in case you need to print something or if you forgot your laptop.

They drop you off at the MGM Grand and you can take the tram to several other casinos along the way or walk in good weather. The breakfast is tasty. However, the biscuits are on the stale side EVERY time we go there. I have learned a trick around this: microwave them with a mug of hot water. It works like a charm.

We usually go to Vegas a few times a year and I have never felt inclined to review any of the hotels, but I felt this was such a great find and value that I wanted to help other people. Now, this is hotel is NOT on the strip. It is about 10 minutes from the action and adjacent to the airport. That being said, it is easy to get to the strip and back. I was surprised that the noise level from the airport was virtually nonexistent. Check in and check out was one of the easiest I have ever experienced. The room was super clean and brand new. My husband loved the LARGE flatscreen TV with tons of channels. The bathroom was very nice and clean as well. There was also a fridge, microwave, and Keurig machine. The bed was one of the best I have slept on while in vacation. We even used the jacuzzie facility and it was wonderful.

However the hotel operates a free minibus service hourly to/from the MGM/Luxor area, and also 'on request' to/from the airport, car rental depot, etc. Each trip is about 20 minutes, the young staff are pleasant and friendly. From the MGM you can get the monorail or Deuce bus to the central Strip [too far to walk] The 'pool' is merely an unheated plunge pool, no bar service [indeed no alcohol in this hotel at all!] and no dining room, just a self-service breakfast area. Food can be ordered from your room for delivery by courier. So for just B&B this is fine, as long as you don't plan to lounge around in the hotel. We booked one night only, based on price and convenience for getting away to the airport for an early flight. For a longer stay, we would look elsewhere, preferably as near to Bellagio as possible/affordable if the Strip is your bag. Bear in mind that once away from this hotel you probably won't be returning for lunch, rest, shower, dinner, etc, so you may be better in a more central hotel with more amenities. Not suitable for children [no distractions]. Free internet access [one PC & printer] at Reception. No WiFi. At booking, I asked for a room near a lift [being disabled] but was allocated a distant room miles from the lift.

The reception personnel assured me that the area was safe and that they had cameras in the parking lot. The breakfast was ample, and pleasantly surprised once again by the hot omelettes they had.

Yesterday when we called the hotel to book a room the front desk agent (name is available if needed) told us there were no rooms available when we were simultaneously checking rates online. Needless to say we booked a room on line, however this the first red flag. After checking in, we called down to the front desk, same guy answered as we inquired were the nearest place to get a sandwich for takeout would be after a long day of traveling. We were told to press *611 on our phone? After trying X611 for about 20 minutes I realized this was not working from the room phone. It was not until later that evening when I noticed our room key card that showed Dial *611 for Sunset Pizza. I was not expecting Ritz-Carlton service however this was a joke. I went online and found 20 plus places to grab food all within 1 mile radius of the hotel. Did you know your room windows do not open, or crack for that matter? I live in Colorado and like fresh air, I have never stayed at a hotel that the windows don't crack. Will they open in the event of a fire? I can see with the airport being so close the nose could be an issue. However a stuffy hotel room in Vegas is not ideal.. Last but NOT least, the property is advertised as dog friendly. This should be changed, ASAP or upgrades need to be made to accommodate dogs. There is NO grass, when I inquired a nice lady at the front desk told me were in the desert... Again, not really what I wanted to hear, luckily I had a car and was able to drive down to Sunset Park to let my dog go potty. P.S. I wasn't even going to mention the kids running up and down the halls of the hotel all evening long or the party that took place downstairs that had someone throw up all over the hallways and elevator.

First of all this hotel is barely a year old and has never allowed smoking. For that reason the rooms are fresh and feel like few have stayed there before. The beds rival any big name, big price hotel which is great after a long day on the strip. The shuttle service at La Quinta Inn and Suites Airport Las Vegas makes this hotel nearly as convenient as any on the strip. It is very prompt and departs for the MGM Grand at the top of every hour. Simply call the front desk and the shuttle will pick you up at quarter past the hour, 24 hours a day! They have a decent FREE continental breakfast, a courtesy business center, FREE Wi-fi, and awesome cookies at the front desk every evening. There is so much to like about this hotel and if you want to leave the glitz and glamour behind each day, then there is no better choice in Las Vegas. About the staff... We noticed that the staff was all quite young but don't let that fool you. This staff is top notch! They are all very pleasant and helpful and are not at all jaded by years in the industry. Since nothing is perfect, these are the imperfections we found. The hot water in the kitchen tastes like coffee even when brewing tea.

The hotel is new and has new hotel smell, new sheet feel and new furniture firm. And the price is great at $89 plus gov't extortion fees. For me this time, it was free with La Quinta Frequent Sleeper points. But you need a car here. It is 4.5 kms from the strip, 6.6 kms to Mandelay Bay if that works for you as a reference (No my American friends, I don't know what that is in miles..or football fields). Book the car on-line cuz it's waaaay cheaper than booking in a hotel or just showing up. Use a premium charge card to avoid the insurance that will double the daily rate of the rental. All the hotels have some free parking. And you'll end up seeing more of Vegas instead of just the carpet weave passed out in a drunken stupor. Also...this is not a fault of the hotel but of the Las Vegas Airport. Find out exactly where \"Level O\" is at the arrivals level as that is where the La Quinta shuttle arrives. There is no one at the baggage claim to ask except workers (I HATE asking workers. It's not their job to act as tour guides to dopey tourists).

The exit from the airport, the road network to the hotel and the ignorance of my driver resulted in a $25 cab ride...and I can see, with binoculars, the arrivals doors from my window in 303! Apparantly, you can't get here from there. But it would be a 10 minute walk across the runway. Returning to the airport though is a snap as the road layout works that direction. So...the room...3rd floor, 1 room away from the end wall to the runway, noise not a problem, nice sofa and 2 chairs, big flat screen, granite counters and shower stall, lots of lamps for light for Geezers-In-Training like myself, fast internet, microwave, fridge, coffee, iron, all new, all clean, decent breakfast...it's all here. It's a small walk (long walk for my American friends ;-) ) to a couple of largely vacant new shopping malls on the corner. The economy really is in the tank isn't it. MacDonalds close, a 7-11 on the corner, a pub and restaurant nearby. I like this place. I'm spending the next 6 nights at the Luxor.

We chose this hotel for its non-smoking designation and I was so disappointed when I could smell cigarette smoke making it's way into our room.

All the things you'd find in a simple breakfast and it was nice and easy. The breakfast room was clean and most guests friendly. The pool was clean and cool.

They made everything so easy from the start, our guests had no problem getting reservations. Our guests were beyond pleased at the wonderful room rate that we received and were more then ecstatic about the quality of the hotel. The front desk staff was very helpful from check in to check out. They were great with questions and replacing lost room keys and getting our rooms close together. They even hand delivered our welcome bags to each of the guests rooms so that they were waiting there when the guests arrived. On our wedding day we were supposed to take a shuttle to the wedding location just a few miles from the hotel, at first there was some confusion on the shuttle but instantly the front desk staff remedied the problem and got me (the crazy bride) and all of my bridal party to the wedding on time. Adam was our shuttle driver and although it was his job to drive us he acted as a counselor and was so pleasant to talk to he actually helped calm me and my anxious mother down during the drive to the wedding which was so helpful. (Lots of good wedding Karma going in Adams direction!!!!) We also had the opportunity to use one of the meeting rooms for a luncheon the day after our wedding for about 45 people who watched a slideshow, ate lunch and watched us open our wedding gifts. Adam (I am unsure of his last name) was so helpful in setting up the room exactly how we wanted it and making sure we had everything we needed to make our event run smoothly. The hotel and rooms were very clean, A MUST if you know my family. The pool was clean and nice, the beds were very comfortable.

Be aware that there are TWO Airport La Quintas in Las Vegas, and I must have been looking at the other one's reviews before, because I expected a lot worse. As many others have said, the facility is very new (it still has a \"NOW OPEN\" banner hanging outside), and it was spotless. It is right across the street from the runway of the airport, so you can see the big planes landing all the time, which my kids loved. The soundproofing is pretty good inside, too. You can hear the occasional jet engine humming, but it's really not bad at all. The only downside to the hotel is that they are so new that they still have a problem showing up properly on GPS and Google Maps. My Google map printoff took me to the north side of the airport, when the hotel is on the south side. When it was clear that we were lost, though, a quick call to the hotel put us in touch with a helpful front desk employee who very kindly gave us great directions. My Dad's GPS also sent him to the other airport La Quinta, so be sure you specify the South location. Breakfast had a lot of choices, and was good enough. We never went away hungry, and a free meal is hard to beat for a family of five. The WiFi is also free, which is not usually the case in most hotels I stay in. And, the price was terrific. We got my family of five (wife and I plus two kids and a baby) into one room for <$60 per night! That is a killer deal, and coupled with all the free perks, can't be beat.

The reception staff (special mention to Jenifer) were so helpful and friendly and made us feel immediately welcome and at ease, and liased with the airline on our behalf regarding our lost luggage. Our room was hugh and spotlessly clean, had two double beds which were the most comfortable I have ever slept on in a hotel. The hotel ran a shuttle bus to and from the Strip as well as the airport, which seemed to depart whenever you wanted them to and could pick you up with only a phone call.

We didn't want to get up! The entire hotel is clean, serene and well appointed, a real haven. The rooms have the warm feel of a guest suite in an elegant private home. The free breakfast was great, with yummy hot waffles, fresh fruit, juices, cereals, yogurts and pastries. The location is away from the mobs and noise of the strip and casinos but really handy to the airport or a quick drive into town or out of it. Since we were planning to drive to visit Death Valley and the Mojave Desert it was perfect, location-wise. The staff were utterly delightful: cheerful, efficient and friendly and absolutely helpful with everything. Adam and Yahiri on the evening shift were just wonderful.
