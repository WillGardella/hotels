It is high quality, just a cut below Ritz-Carlton or Fairmont. There are no unpleasant surprises; on the other hand, there are no surprises at all. There is not much to distinguish it from the Marriott in the next block, the Sheraton around the corner, or the hotel the frequent traveler was in last week. It has a cafe and twenty four hour room service. For the frequent traveler traveling alone, it has a friendly bar with a good bar menu. There is also the lounge that the frequent traveler expects. Since my stay was on a Friday night, I cannot speak to the quality of this one or the quality of the breakfast. The shop is well stocked with the things that the frequent traveler is likely to need, from ice cream to a change of underwear, gifts for the children but not for the spouse. Remember this is an \"airport\" location, so parking is not much of an issue but there is prompt valet parking for a fee. It is walking distance to the rental car lots for the the airport. Your rental car can be left with the doorman while you check-out and get your luggage. However, there is a charge if one is there for more than twenty minutes. Remember, this service is about convenience, not the money. However, speaking of money, my room was $110- for a Friday night, in the spring, booked on the Marriott web site, within a week of my travel. This is about the same as the Marriott in the next block but less than half the rack rate. One can expect market rates. As I said, this a convenient hotel designed for the frequent traveler.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Menlo Park, California", "Title": "\u201cEverything was fine, yet I still didn't like it...\u201d", "Author": "mjs7777", "ReviewID": "UR129012132", "Content": "Really strange - there wasn't anything in particular that was bad but it just wasn't very comfortable.

I ate at the restaurant for lunch. The menu contained about 10 items TOTAL. And it was $$$$ for lunch (especially with Burger King across the way). That being said, the $21 salad I ordered (yes, $21- salad, water and average tip) was really good! I had asked for the dressing on the side, but they put it on the salad anyways (seemed like a simple request for a small order that they should have got right). It was the California Salad and I had them add chicken. And I saw the $15 burger and fries across at another table: looked pretty delicious as well! Staff was very attentive. You had to ask for bread or else they didn't bring it. So if you are staying there, and in a rush for a quick lunch, it was yummy but pricey. Overall, good place to stay.

As a Marriott Gold Member I am a dedicated Marriott patron. We had reservations for my son and I for one night before flying back home. Our reservation was a guarantee for 2 beds and was paid for on a Marriott Certificate, one they gave me for staying so many nights in a designated period of time. From the time I walked into this hotel, I don't know if it was because I had my 10 year old son with me or was a \"non-paying\" guest, but we were treated like second class citizens. The front desk clerk didn't say more than two words to us during check in and when questioned, answered in a curt, unprofessional manner. They told me that my room only had one bed - even though we had a guarantee for 2 beds. When I questioned her, she laughed at me and told me those guarantees didn't mean anything. We had no amenities explained to us, like location of Club Lounge, restuarant options, etc. Frankly they had no interest in making sure we had a pleasant stay. Feeling a little frustrated I emailed the hotel after my arrival home and questioned their policy on the guaranteed room. While they couldn't answer me directly, they were kind enough to say they would refund the certificate we used and the $46 we spent on dinner in their restaurant. I was feeling much better and ready to move on. However, now over 2 weeks later, no refund, no re-issued certificate and no response from the hotel. While not every hotel employee can be the tops, I am seeing a patern of employees who really have a lack of customer service. I have stayed several times at the Marriott LAX next door and found it to be a wonderful property.

The poor service at this hotel is typical of the overpriced, wanna-be-upscale hotels. The poor service started after I checked in and wanted to park my rental car. It costs $25/day for this privilege. However, I could not get the arm to open in the hotel, despite two additional trips to the front desk, and trying to get some help by pressing the \"assistance needed\" button on the intercom at the parking garage. When someone finally answered, I got one of the young valet parking attendants, who mumbled something at me and hung up. When that didn't work, once again, I had to back up and go back to the front desk again. Same thing happened the next morning when I tried to leave. Oh yeah - besides those problems, the elevator in the garage wasn't working that morning, so I had to figure out where the stairs were. In addition to these problems, I got the impression that no one really cared about little things like this, but they are happy to charge $25/day for parking and $13/day for internet. Some other little things -- the directions to the concierge lounge were wrong, so I had to wander around the 10th and 11th floors until I finally figured it out. No newspaper in front of my room each morning (usually standard for elite members at the top-level Marriotts). I asked the maid for extra coffee, but she was stingy and only wanted to give me one extra pack. Closet doors would not close because the iron was blocking it. Very few electrical outlets. One of the silliest things was a sign in the parking garage, telling us that we were in a residential area and that we should be mindful of our noise. Hah -- this was not in a residential area, and besides, it is under the LAX flight path (if you go outside of the hotel you'll see planes landing every couple of minutes). A sign like this is just condescending.

They let us check in at 1pm. We thank them for that. Although, there was a HUGE line to check in or check out at the front desk. That always makes me wonder. Why, at a decent hotel, would there be a line of 25 people just to see the front desk? Understaffed? Guess so. Hotel seemed dated. So did our room. They also offered us an upgrade to a suite for $50! We took it, as we have 2 little boys and the thought of an extra large room was just what we needed. The \"upgrade\" included the hotels $27 parking fee $12.95 wifi and a complimentary bottle of water in the room! Ok, just kidding about the water. The water was $4.95. OUCH. Come on! Throw in a bottle of water! So really, we were paying around $10.00 for the upgrade. I am glad we only paid $10 extra dollars, because this was not a \"suite\". Maybe an old Jr. Jr. Suite. Basically a small room with a VERY COMFORTABLE King bed and a living room that held a table and a couch that converts to a lumpy \"bed\". Yes, the King bed was VERY comfortable... Slept like a baby. When they mentioned \"upgrade to a suite\" I had visions of a whirlpool tub, robes, nice comfy towels etc... Yeah, well, none of that was there. Bummer. Oh, and you HAVE to see the safe! An old school turn nob with numbers! The bathroom was no larger than a regular, small bathroom and the towels were ridiculously thin. I mean, I have had better towels at a Motel 6. No joke. I liked the shower head. Nice flow of water. But this was no \"suite bathroom\". It was a bathtub shower! There were no pillows for the couch bed and no extra blankets. Not to mention I had to hunt down a cleaning person to grab extra towels as only 2 bath towels were in the \"suite\". The light next to the bed was not working. Tried calling the front desk, but the phone rang about 20 times, so I gave up. They really must be understaffed as it took a long time to get a bellman to take my bags to the room and then to bring them down the next day. Oh, and a new pet peeve. WHY do they only have 1 regular coffee packet in the room? My guess, is that this \"suite\" normally has at least 2 people. So what is the deal with only ONE regular coffee packet! Are my wife and I supposed to split the one? The Aveda products are nice.

They also impose a $12.95 daily fee for internet use in your room. They have a free use computer in the lobby strictly for printing out boarding passes. There's a nice restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner as well as room service well into the evening. The food was pretty good but somewhat expensive as hotel food service is apt to be.

The Renaissance Los Angeles Airport Hotel offers sophisticated design and internationally acclaimed art collection. The Marriott LAX where I have also stayed has the feel of a large convention style hotel and a bit of a seedy worn feel to it. I have stayed at the Renaissance LAX several times as well as other LAX Airport properties and the Renaissance is by far the best bet. Just ensure that you get a fair rate tho \u2013 I paid $159.00 per room and after the fact discovered by shopping on Priceline, Orbitz etc that this could be lowered to $60 =$109. I overpaid by a significant amount and consequently felt ripped off! That said this is still good bang for your buck and if you have to stay close to LAX an excellent four star establishment at a 3 star cost, not a bad option! Room was nice and clean very well appointed and spacious. The beds are very comfortable and everything in the room is very clean. Aveda products in the bathroom, good quality towels and bathrobe. No free bottled water in concierge level rooms \u2013 just large bottles of Evian at $4.50 per bottle! Free WiFi for Marriott Platinum members. The Concierge Club is on the 11th floor and is a very nice spacious room serving breakfast and great evening snacks. The gym on the second floor is great and they provide headsets and prepackaged moist towels. There is also a nice outside pool and \u2018his\u2019 and \u2018her\u2019 dry saunas The Lobby is well decorated, modern and clean as well as the adjacent restaurant/bar area. The staff in general are very welcoming and the ambiance is both relaxing & elegant. Small cramped business center. There is a frequent shuttle service to and from the airport. Negatives: - I should have done my homework properly on the price and the elevators are extremely slow. - Overpriced parking - Parking is very expensive, they charge $25 for self parking and $28 for valet. Street parking is an option, if you don\u2019t mind walking half a mile, the street parking fills up fast.

From the beginning it started out poorly. While checking in at the front desk. As a Platinum Elite Member I\u2019m used to having an accessible Concierge Lounge with complimentary bottled water and soft drinks. Since this was a Friday evening, I knew there would be no service in the Lounge for the weekend so I asked the young lady at the front desk about breakfast since the lounge wouldn\u2019t be serving on Saturday. When I stay on weekends I usually get my breakfast comped. This property comps nothing. To make matters worse, the young lady stated the Concierge Lounge is for Platinum Members only. I guess since I was wearing a sweatshirt and jeans instead of my usual suit, she assumed I was a nobody. I reminded her I was a Platinum Elite Member and she stated, Oh! I told her I wanted a room that wasn\u2019t connected as I always do because of the noise from the rooms next door. She stated she would give me a corner room (and that usually means a larger room). I got to the room and the first thing I noticed is that it was a connecting room which I told her I didn\u2019t want. As a corner room, this was the smallest room I\u2019ve seen. I called and got a different room which was much bigger. The bed was very hard, not like the comfortable Marriott bedding I find at other properties. The wireless internet was not working, nor was the DSL connection. I called the front desk again, and they transferred me to the help desk. I waited and waited on hold, but gave up after five minutes. The next task was to find dinner. I asked a lady working the Concierge desk if there were any restaurants that delivered. She gave me a few menus from local places and told me I must be in my room when they arrive if I order out. Once again, my intelligence was insulted by a young lady who must have thought I was a country bumpkin. I explained to her I do this on a regular basis and walked away. How rude these employees were! I stopped by the Concierge Lounge to at least get some bottled water, but everything was put away so nobody could get anything. I ran into another gentleman in the lounge also looking for water, and he too agreed this was unreal, and the personnel were unfriendly. So after a long day of flying I decided to take a shower. At least that worked well. After drying off, I put the robe on that was hanging in the closet, and couldn\u2019t help but laugh. This was the smallest, tightest, cheesiest robe I\u2019ve ever seen. It felt almost like spandex it was so tight. I then decided to order out after seeing the room service menu and found the best Italian food. This was the only high point at this Renaissance. The Restaurant was Valentino\u2019s Pizza and I figured it would be good since they guy I spoke with on the phone was Italian. Their food exceeded my expectations, and the prices were very reasonable. I\u2019ll write a review on them later. Getting back to the Renaissance. Will I stay here again? Never! Will I recommend it to anyone? Never! I think I would stay at a Fairfield Inn over this place. At least the Fairfield Inns have friendly employees. At the best, this is a three star property. The General Manager here certainly doesn\u2019t promote customer service. I stay at Marriott properties all over the U.S. because Marriott has the best customer service that I\u2019ve come to expect. so if you are looking for a hotel near Los Angeles International Airport, don\u2019t stay here. There are a lot of other hotels by the airport that I\u2019ll bet have much better service.

It is a beautiful property from the lobby to the restaurant/bar area and the rooms are much sleeker and more spacious than the other 2 hotels mentioned. (I should mention there is nothing wrong with either the Marriott or the Hilton. Just that the Renaissance has a bit more intimate \"polish\". You don't feel you are at an airport property) The staff are very welcoming, un-rushed and clearly enjoy their roles. The food & cocktails in the lobby venue were absolutely above anything we have experienced at other properties. Very original menu with a delightful twist on the typical offerings. The chef has done some creative & inventive cuisine so delicious, we kept looking at each other wondering how we had overlooked the Renaissance until now!!! Even the bartender offered up the perfect martinis which were generous to a fault, but, please don't tell him/her. Our stay was the night after Thanksgiving & probably pretty quiet overall so the front desk upgraded us to a junior suite without even asking. The bed was out of this world so our early wake-up call came after a wonderful night's sleep. So, for the night before your departures or an extended stay, EXPECT MORE if you stay at the Renaissance. The ambiance everywhere was relaxing & elegant. The valet for extended parking was efficient and cheerful. A lovely young lady was in charge of operations the night we arrived and she was there when our vacation was over with our car delivered promptly to the front drive. It does make a difference when hotel associates love their jobs. We had booked the extended parking deal at a separate web site: CheapAirportParking.org.

I immediately jumped out of bed and killed what I saw and even have pictures to prove it, which I'm happy I chose to do and I'll share why. I took one of the bed bugs down to the front desk to show them and the front desk clerk told me he would have to take the bug to show the exterminator and then said, \"have a nice day\" with never an apology or the managers name and number. After checking out, I threw out the Pajama's and under garments I was wearing and once I arrived home threw out all of my luggage and all leather items that could not be laundered. I also called the hotel manager and never heard back until a family member sent a letter to someone at corp. and they urged the general manager to return my call. During our conversation he admitted to having found bed bugs in my room. In the interm of not hearing back from the manager, I also called the LA county health dept. but once they arrived it was too late. The hotel room had been vacated and all furniture pulled out and the extermination process was in place and they told him that no bed bugs had been found but were treating it \"just in case\". I was then passed onto the claims department and told all of my items I had thrown out would be replaced. That was the last I have heard from Marriott. They are no longer communicating with me and are saying the room never had any bed bugs to begin with and that basically I am lying. My family and myself have been loyal to Marriott and have exclusively stayed only at Marriott when traveling and have always been treated well, that is until now. I am shocked and disappointed in how they've treated me through this whole ordeal and all I can say is, thank goodness I saw these bed bugs crawling around my bed as aweful as it was, because I knew not to bring a single item into my home.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redlands, California", "Title": "\u201cTop Notch Service at a Top Notch Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "TravelFam39", "ReviewID": "UR116917129", "Content": "This hotel did a perfect job taking care of me as their customer!

Marriott, and other chains, need to move with the times - how many people travel with their tablets! 3. Check in took about 20 minutes.

At the time of booking the hotel was offering a 25% discounted rate which made the price much more reasonable. From the outset, I can admit that we would not pay the full rate for what we got - simply overpriced in our opinion, especially with parking and internet being being additional charges. Our check in was not as smooth as planned as we waited curb side at LAX for over half an hour before the complimentary shuttle appeared. The wait included two phone calls to reception to try and track down the transport! The issue is not the fault of the hotel due to the badly designed LAX collection bays - but the hotel should pay more attention to the whereabouts of their shuttles as there was another bus directly behind our shuttle making a mockery of their claim that one they are set at 15 min intervals. Maybe one bus skipping some stops and going ahead to passengers at other terminals is advised? The hotel itself was very quiet and clean. The beds were a bit soft for our liking but that is simply personal preference. We all slept well so that is the important thing! Breakfast is overpriced so we opted for a simple meal at the Burger King across the road. We did pay the additional fee for internet nor did we have time to fully explore the hotel. Instead we took a taxi downtown for approx $30 - convenient as there is a taxi bay at the front of the hotel. For the afternoon, we purchased Manhattan Beach trolley tickets from the hotel for which the closest stop was only a short walk away. It was a nice way to spend the afternoon - but beware that this is not a quick journey so you shouldn't plan this outing on a tight schedule.

Getting to the hotel is easy as can be, with free shuttle buses to and from all terminals of the airport about every 15 minutes. The friendly desk staff were able to meet my request for an early check in, which was much appreciated since I desperately needed a comfortable place to crash. And it was extremely comfortable, despite the room being a little smaller than I anticipated (it's just that they look bigger on the hotel website, the standard room is still perfectly adequate for a solo traveler or couple). I had a nice hot bath in the clean bathroom and used the free Aveeno products, then relaxed on the super comfy bed and watched cable tv. The Renaissance has the convenient proximity to the airport but not the noise of one. Really, it's so well soundproofed and that you forget you're near an airport until you walk out and see planes practically on top of you. That combined with the amazing bed and nice heavy curtains that completely block out the light ensure a good nights sleep. There are a couple of little downsides. The wireless internet is expensive ($12.95 a day) and if you want take out it's around a 15 minute walk to anything (Sepulvuda Blvd has lots of shops.) But if you can spare the money for a proper meal, the hotel restaurant the 96th St Bistro is excellent. Just order a main meal (they range in price from $18-40) and for free you get a small loaf of bread with 3 spreads (big enough to serve as a starter) and then afterwards they bring you this massive strawberry covered in chocolate and nuts that is amazing. So you get a free starter and free desert! The hotel is gorgeous too, with artwork in the lobby and nice looking decor.

The check-in staff was both very professional and friendly, with the sort of crisp attitude that often seems lacking at 9 p.m. among airport-hotel employees. The lobby and public rooms are stylish and appealing, and would not feel out of place downtown. The hotel perhaps aspires to be a little more chic than it can credibly pull off, given its location and purpose as airport lodging, but the bar seemed lively and people appeared to enjoy themselves in the sitting area near the entrance. My room was fully functional, on the smaller end for a four-star hotel but in keeping with other higher-end airport hotels at which I've stayed. The bathroom was fresh and relatively spacious, making up for the slightly utilitarian, though very clean, nature of the bedroom itself. Regrettably, Renaissance, like the rest of the Marriott chain, does charge an exorbitant rate -- roughly $15 a night -- for Internet access. A friend met me the next morning in his car, leaving it in the hotel's convenient garage. Realizing that we'd left the parking card in my room after check-out, I went back to the front desk, which immediately billed my credit card for two hours of parking without any questions and put the credit on my room key, so that I simply needed to swipe the key card at the garage exit and was on my way.

At the check in, they were fine to send us to the room on the 3rd floor looking at the mechanical system on the roof knowing the status. We changed. The conceirge lounge was out of late night snack only after one hour they began to serve. The arrival gift did not arrive at that night even after we asked. The clerk told us to do so next day and it was completely forgotten. We asked again and finally arrived way after the dinner time; ended up changing the item from what we wanted because it was so late. What I found was the reception desk clerk was pleasant and just did not mean anything she said. Later, he realized he left his blue tooth in the room and called the desk and asked for it. The clerk was pretty rude. My husband regretted, out of all the Marriott places he stays, Renaissance was the place he happened to leave the item. Imagine their service to general customers if that's the service we get as a status customer. Since it was a short stay near the airport, we did not pay much for this hotel. Found that's what we got, but that was not anything near Marriott experience even from their Courtyard level. One positive thing I need to mention is the house keepers are great.

However, i managed to test out many of the features and services they had to offer. First, the good: - Excellent service. Very attentive, friendly, and willing to please - Great location. Along with the complimentary airport shuttle, it was a breeze to get to and from the hotel - Room Service. I always order breakfast from room service and the meal arrived hot, fresh, and very tasty. Most room service, and especially for breakfast, arrives luke warm, and somewhat dry. not the case here. - Free WiFi in lobby. They also had power stations to plug in laptops, and made it very easy in general to take care of business. Now, the bad: - Rooms were a bit dingy. My room wasnt dirty per se, but it definitely had a worn feel and look about it - Showers. Barely warm water, and a shower head that could not have been more than 5'6\". I am 6'4\", so it was an awkward shower at best - NOT free WiFi in the rooms. I dont understand this, they have free WiFi in the lobby, why not in the rooms? And why is the free lobby WiFi not communicated to us? I paid $10 for internet in the room, only to find out the next morning that it was free in the lobby. We're only going to stand for $10-20 internet access for so long before we start changing our business travel habits accordingly. I am personally very close to only booking hotels that offer free WiFi, regardless of the other amenities. - The downstairs bar - bartender was very friendly, but $9 for a well vodka and cranberry? Are you serious? This isnt some hot spot and it wasnt saturday night. It was Tuesday afternoon in an empty hotel bar. $9 for a watered down drink? Finally, i rated Value at 3 stars.

The residential area down the road had several police cars the day we drove in, so probably not so safe either. But within 5 to 10 minutes drive you are in Marina Del Rey and Santa Monica. The only negative feedback I have for the hotel itself is that they should have a permanent coffee bar open. When I came down in the morning, hoping for some fresh coffee and pastries, the staff were all in the restaurant serving breakfast. When I asked about just purchasing some coffee they motioned me to the hotel bar, but there was no one there, so I just went upstairs and made my own coffee in the room.

The location is good - the shuttle bus only takes a few minutes to the terminals - and there is easy self parking in the structure behind the hotel. OK here's where the cautions come in. The rate for an overnight and 7 days parking was $209 (plus the inevitable tax); but my bill was for just south of $400 because we elected to eat in the hotel and have a couple of beers that evening. Breakfast option as a result was a quick run across the street to the Burger King. Now for even more care! On the return leg we got on the blue hotel bus only to discover that it dropped us at an entirely different hotel - thankfully less than 10 minutes walk of the Renaissance - but imagine schlepping two big bags after an overnight flight. Seems that more than one hotel has identical blue buses and that's a definite problem. To my shame I did not make a big fuss with the hotel as by then the valet was trying to charge me $48 for my extra night but billed as $11 on the hotel internet.

Given that most of my time was spent sleeping, my experience in this hotel is somewhat limited. Here's what I found in that short time, though. Shuttle service to/from the airport is very fast--it's 24/7 and runs every 15-20 minutes. The airport is very close to the hotel. I arrived hungry; the restaurant had closed but the desk clerk told me I could order food at the bar. When I asked at the bar, I was told it was too late and had to use room service. The room service menu was very limited and would take too long, so I looked for vending machines. Nothing. the only other source of food was a Burger King across the street, but I didn't want to venture out alone at night--it's very dark in that area. Went to bed hungry. The room was nice enough--lots of pillows and newly renovated, but not as nice as the Plain Old Marriott I had just come from in Toronto. I'm not sure why this hotel is in the Renaissance category...maybe the marble in the lobby. When I awoke four hours later to catch my next flight, I stumbled into the bathroom only to find that there was no hot water in the shower. And I mean NONE--not even lukewarm. The tap in the sink provided barely lukewarm water. So, unshowered and grumpy, I checked out at the front desk. The clerk could have cared less when I informed her of the lack of hot water. Normally I would have pursued the issue, but I had the shuttle waiting and a plane to catch, and left a very unhappy customer.

Nice place! No problems. I do agree with other users who have stated that the outside could use renovation. The inside, however, is very nice and well-maintained. The maids did a very thorough job. I was in the room at one point while it was being cleaned, and ours spend a good 10 minutes in the bathroom alone. Despite proximity to the airport, we never heard a single plane. I was confused as to whether or not there was a pool, after reading reviews on here which state there is not, but looking at the website for the hotel, it stated there was. YES, there IS a pool and whirlpool. It is located on the second floor, on the outside of the fitness facilities. Go into the fitness facilities, and the pool and whirlpool are right outside the door. It's not a huge pool by any means, but it is adequate. I'd imagine it would be a nightmare in the summer time. I do have video of the fitness facility/pool for those interested. I didn't try room service, although the menu seemed reasonably priced enough. They offered a breakfast fruit platter for $9. Now, if you're looking for dollar menu breakfasts (or lunches, or dinners), room service is probably not for you. I did research before my stay (mind you, I live in California and drove down there, so I had a car) and just down the street is Century Blvd, which has Denny's, McDonalds, Taco Bell/Pizza Hut, CA Pizza Kitchen, Jack in the Box ETC. So, if you're not a Burger King fan (which is across the street from this hotel), no worries! It is about 8/10 of a mile according to Mapquest. Google Century Blvd Restaurants Los Angeles to see the complete list of nearby dining. It is just up the street, turn left and you're pretty much there. I was quite confused with the TV. There are very few (free) channels, realistically, and while they did offer movies, even recent theatrical releases, I wasn't keen on the idea of paying $19.99 to see Hancock, which I wasn't impressed with the first time I saw it. for $8 . Luckily, I had my laptop, and some DVDs, and placed that next to the TV. If you're planning to stay for a length of time, I reccomend a laptop or portable DVD player. Bring DVDs of your favorite TV shows. Hollywood and Sunset Blvd are about 10 miles, and you do not need to get on the freeway to go to either. It's not a horrible drive, and as you're driving, you get a good view of the Hollywood Sign, which you don't get as you drive to this hotel (again, the hotel is off the 405, you can see the Hollywood Sign from the 101). This hotel is also not far (about the same distance-10 miles or so) from Rodeo Drive, the world famous 3-block shopping district in Beverly Hills. This hotel is an excellent penny-saver option for those who want to tour the nearby LA landmarks, such as those above mentioned. I'm not going to reccomend this hotel for families with children, for one reason- Location. This is no where near the major theme parks (which, unless flying, travelers with children are most likely going to be in the LA area for). Disneyland is clear down off of 5, this hotel is off the 405. Unless you want to do some driving, I would reccomend paying the extra money to stay at a hotel in Anaheim (which is in a different county from LA), if you're going to Disneyland, Calif. Adventure, ETC. With traffic, you're looking at an easy 1 hr drive one-way to or from the Disney parks. If you're going to Six Flags, that is also off 5, North of LA, and also a distance from this hotel (or any LAX hotel). Pay the extra money to stay in a hotel adjacent to the theme parks, and save the long drive. Your kids will thank you. If you're traveling through LAX, if you're going to see LA area landmarks, I highly reccomend this hotel.", "Date": "October 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cGreat overnight stay\u201d", "Author": "rosspk", "ReviewID": "UR21239557", "Content": "Stayed overnight as first leg of our US trip.

The bellman who brought our bags up was very helpful when we discovered the fridge was not working. Turns out, it's not a fridge at all but a \"chiller\" whatever that is. But they brought a real fridge up for us for no extra so that was good. The bathroom was nice and big but it appeared that the maid had not done her job properly. There were towels but no toilet paper! One roll was completely empty and the other almost empty. We had to ring down for more. There was also no bath soap only one for the sink.

We booked one night to attend a function being held at the hotel so we wouldn't have to drive the 30+ miles back home at midnight after the festivities. The 11th floor room with club lounge access was nice; but the hallway outside smelled like a 55 gallon drum of 90 weight transmission oil was hidden within a 10' radius. Perhaps the elevators were just serviced? It did remind me that I need to stop by JiffyLube this week to have my oil changed in the car... We booked the \"Romance Package\" for a few extra $$$ (a bottle of chilled champagne, chocolate-dipped strawberries & fresh rose petals sprinkled on the bed upon arrival)! Note: \"Upon Arrival\" means sometime after 6pm....no matter when you arrive (check-in starts at 3pm). We checked in at 4:30pm - no romance. We called front desk to check on romance's status, & were told we'd have it within 30 minutes. We went to the club lounge...hor's douvres start at 5:30 pm. Until then, there were plenty of sodas, bottled water and coffee/tea available, along with some not-quite-ripe pears. At 5:30, they set out some VERY nice appetizers (shot glasses filled w/veggie sticks, rice with curried chicken skewers, cute little gourmet cheese & dried fruit bowls with crackers). Drinks at the lounge were pricey, w/average wine going for $8.50/glass. Better wine was more. (Hint: the liquor store on the corner of 98th & Airport will sell you a BOTTLE of average wine for about the same $$$). After a quick hunger-satisfying snack, we returned to our room to dress for the evening's gala in one of the ballrooms. SURPRIZE!! A hotel staffer was \"preparing\" the Romance Package - Part I for us by lazily spreading rose petals on the bed. We all agreed that they were pretty, and smelled really nice. But, OK...some ambiance is definitely lost when you have to sit on the couch & chatting with and watching somebody prepare your room for \"Romance\". And this was only PART I of the romance thing....Part II was handled by \"Mr. Catering Guy\" who knocked at the door bearing said champage & strawberries 15 minutes after \"Ms. Rose Petal\" left with her empty rose-petal-holding-mini-suitcase. In the meantime, since romance was on hold for a spell, we turned on the plasma TV to catch up on the day's affairs. The sound on the TV set was amazing! The completely black picture, however, left something to be desired. A quick check of the cables & controls left us with the realization that this problem was over our heads and we'd need a professional to fix it. We finished dressing, and being cautious travelers, placed our valuables in the thoughtfully provided personal safe located in the top dressser drawer (great idea - beats having to crawl into the closet to find the safe, which is where most hotels place them). Just before leaving, we placed a call to the front desk lodging our TV repair request, and placed another in-person request with the Concierge on our way downstairs to attend the pre-gala cocktail party (just in case). Attendance at the cocktail party was great, but that also meant \"crowded\", with lots of bodies in little space (the hallway outside the banquet room). It got really hot, really fast. We decided to take short leave of the festivities and head back up to our room to enjoy a glass of cold champagne and a chocolate-dipped berry or two, because (as it was upstairs in the club lounge) a glass of mediocre wine was $8.50. Back at our rose petal festooned room, we found \"Mr. Maintenance\" carefully checking the plasma TV. He deduced that the tube was blown, and announced he was on the way downstairs to see if there was another TV around he could swap out. We advised him that we'd be there for about 20 minutes, so to come back after that, which he apparently did, as when we returned after 11:00 pm, the plasma was fixed. The last issue happened when we tried to access the thoughtfully-provided-and-easily-accessible-personal-safe containing our valuables, and found that no matter how many times we entered the carefully programmed personal code, the LED display returned a \"ERROR90\" message. Another call placed to the front desk requesting someone come by to fix obstinate electronic device resulted in yet another hotel staff member (this time from security) knocking on the door; this time at 11:45 pm, to reprogram the safe and rescue our belongings. While this seems like a lot of inconvenience...I can say the room itself was quite nice, the hor's douvres and the breakfast items were terrific - after we turned in the slight molded bagels in exchange for fresher, less green English Muffins. Recommend the management pay a bit of attention to quality checking the well-decorated and appointed rooms, and some time reviewing guest-preparation processes.

Assuming this was just an oversight, on our first night we got a fourth towel from housekeeping. After our room was made up the next day, however, lo and behold! we once again had only three bath towels. We requested another, and this too disappeared after the next day's housekeeping. Evidently towel-rationing is hotel policy. Also, the \"glasses\" in the room were those nasty plastic cellophane-wrapped cups, and they gave us only two at a time--evidently you can either brush your teeth or enjoy a drink, but not both! Finally, there is no free internet access in this hotel. There's a daily charge to use the in-room wireless or ethernet, and perhaps that's not surprising, given that business travelers might spend quite a bit of time online.

We had booked the hotel through a friend and had choose amongst five different Marriott hotels. Based on the reviews at tripadvisor, we chose Renaissance Montura. We shouldn't have done that. We had planned to drive around in Los Angeles but due to the humungous cost of rentning a car - which really surprised us - the amount that was stated on the web site of the rental car company was more than doubled when we actually got to the rental company - and for a European who is not used to driving in 10 or 12 lane freeways the traffic was terrible. We ended up returning the rented car and got by using taxis and the metro railway instead. To get to - for instance Universal Studios - you had to take the tranist bus to LAX, then take the LAX transit bus to the metro to the green line. Take the green line and change for the red line all in all making it a two and a half hour trip to get from the hotel to Universal with public transportation. Be advised that the red line runs through South Central and Watts - and it is NOT a pretty neighborhood. Now it comes down to location. The hotel is located far, far away from the attractive parts of LA. There is a Burger King right next to the hotel but that's about it when it comes to eating opportunities. When it comes to the hotel a lot of problems occured. First of all, our room wasn't really prepared for us. Half a bottle of bottled water left from the last occupant of the room were still in the room when we arrived. It took five - 5 - days for the maid to remove it, though we told the reception about a lot of times. The windows were all greased up as if a small child had been playing there. The pool is nothing special. The biggest problem though was the personal which was rather rude. One of the employees asked us to show ID before we could enter the elevator at one occassion and we were dressed rather nicely. A tv repairman which had to fine tune are flat screen tv after they changed the television set didn't speak a word of English and couldn't fix the tv.

It is only 5 mins to hotel which after a lengthy flight & wait at customs is divine! The lobby area is modern and classy, check in was a breeze and staff were friendly and accommodating from the concierge, porter to domestic staff.

Our room looked out over LAX whose proximity initially worried me with noise, however we didnt hear a thing! A check out time of 1 pm was handy too as our flight was later that day - express check out via the TV system was easy & saved time. Burger King is located accross the road - and judging by the foot traffic I would say that it does a lot of patronage from Renaissance guests ! ha! Okay so it is located in LAX and away from major attractions, but LA itself is a sprawling area, so you are never going to stay in one place that has everything. It is close to Santa Monica - the bus transit centre is a 5 minute walk (75 cents to Santa Monica & $1.25 to downtown LA via bus). And if you want to venture further many of the tours available pick up from the LAX area.

The only complaint I have is that the guest rooms were a bit cramped. We would often bump into one another because there was limited space between the end of the bed and the dresser. However, the beds themselves more than made up for it. They featured duvets and other European-style appointments as well as enormous pillows which made it especially comfortable when sitting up against the headboard.

I was expecting a basic continental but it turned out to be a fairly comprehensive buffet style with white table clothes and full service. They do have a menu if you choose. We also ate dinner one night and again I was very impressed. The Sword Fish with lobster sauce was increadable.

The hotel is really designed to give people in transit staying, I suspect, for an average of one or maybe two nights. That is why I tend to rate the hotel as fine and may other people on tripadvisor.com would rave about the hotel. The hotel has been going through a process of staggered renovation and there has been a real improvement in the quality and state of the bedrooms. One improvement, in my view, being the beds! These are definitely soft, comfortable and have piles of pillows to snuggle down into at night. The rooms are a good size, both the normal rooms and the suites although the latter tend to be fairly dark. There is usually good space to do work, good internet access and fairly good bathrooms with great water pressure. The one thing that is a pity they have not addressed is the air conditioning which is very boisterous and noisy, and I have found that I need to leave it off when going to bed at night and so in summer the rooms get hot and bit uncomfortable over night. The other area that is not great is the bar and dining facilities. The bar is small and not that exciting and the food is pretty average and limited. So while this is fine when there for a night or maybe two, if you stay any longer then you tire of the food. The problem being that as this is a hotel airport there is nowhere to pop out and walk to for an alterative meal. There is a small outdoor pool that is very popular, with small hot tub. The gym is pretty good with a range of cardio equipment to keep most people happy with TVs above each. The weights area is very limited but fine again for a work out. The hotel has a large parking garage with self parking or valet parking. The view from rooms in the front of the hotel are over the airport and worth asking for when you check in - or you get the view of the multi story car park (which you will see I always have had!) So this is a good hotel for an airport hotel, probably good for a conference as is so handy for the airport but not a hotel to spend longer in. One thing as an aside is although planes come really close to the hotel the hotel is very sound proof and even between rooms is very well insulated! A tips is that you can get amazing rates for club room access at the weekend (from a Thursday to a Monday check-out) off their website.
