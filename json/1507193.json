This hotel is truly in the middle of it all but in a very quiet area. The room itself was still as good as new. I asked one of the housekeepers how old the Hotel was and she told me 2 years.

We'd chosen this hotel as we'd stayed previously at the next door Homewood Suites. We chose this hotel because it has a restaurant so we could get something to eat without travelling anywhere. I'd chosen our room the night before when I went to run off the confirmation. We had a choice of rooms so chose a 1 bedroomed suite on the 7th floor, brilliant as we'd paid for a room only. The assistant at check in couldn't initially find our paperwork & asked us if we had got the wrong hotel. Then I said we'd checked in online & she found it. The suite was fantastic! Spacious, clean, airy & very comfortable. The very spacious bathroom could be entered via the sitting room or the bedroom. The televisions were flat screen. Didn't hear any noise whatsoever from either the corridor or outside. This hotel isn't directly fronting the I- 4 so thre's not the buzz of traffic. The evening meal we had was good & the service excellent. At breakfast the choice was standard fayre but very good. It is far more tranquil than the Homewood Suites but each fills a need in the market. The pool is shared with the Homewood Suites but I've never seen it crowded. The aircon in our bedroom was a tad noisy but bearable. I chatted to a tall slender lady who checked us out who I presume was the manager.

Travel time from the airport was approximately 30 minutes, an easy drive (includes tolls). The rooms were comfortable and reasonably spacious, and included a medium-size flat screen TV (no DVD player or iHome). The hotel had the basic amenities most travellers would want -- on-site dining, bar, workout room, outdoor pool and hot tub. Front desk staff was very friendly, and always greeted us as we came and went. This hotel offers 3x daily shuttles to the nearby parks, but we had a rental car so we didn't use that service. Parking was free, and a business center is available if you want to print out your boarding passes etc. One minor quibble: The hotel web site advertises having a heated outdoor pool, but the water temp was only about 74 when we were there - a little cool for the grown-ups, but that didn't stop our daughter from jumping in! The hot tub was delightful, especially after a long day trekking through the theme parks. The pool area was well stocked with towels (the towel quality leaves a bit to be desired, but no big deal).

I've stayed at a lot 5 star hotels and had a lot of experiences but this Hilton was actually worth writing about. In early November, I found myself in Orlando without a hotel room due to no fault of my own. I was attending a large scientific conference and there were only rooms available at 2 hotels near the Orange County convention center where the conference was held...I chose the LaQuinta. Yuk is all I had to say when I arrived at 7:00pm on a Friday. I'll save the icky details for my 0 star Laquinta review. Anyway, out of desperation I called the Hilton main line and requested a property as close to the convention center as possible. I like the Hilton brand so I thought, how bad could it be. Anything was better than that nasty LaQuinta. I was told by the rep that there was 1 room available at the Hilton Garden Inn Lake Buena Vista/Orlando, so I took it. After complaining to the folks at the LaQuinta and demanding a full refund, I jumped in my rent-a-car and headed to Marbella Palm Court. They saved the day! Upon entering, I couldn't help but notice the modern decor in the place. In addition, I was greeted by 2 pleasant and pretty young ladies who politely listened to me rant about my experience at the LaQuinta. After welcoming me to the property and offering me fresh cookies I was on my way to my room...With my fingers crossed. To my surprise, I entered a very nice modern room with a fresh scent, microwave, fridge, ergonomically correct chairs, and adjustable mattresses...Everything you need to be comfortable. I'll continue...There was modern technology, a variety of cable news networks, great water pressure in the showers, down pillows, etc. For the very reasonable rate that I paid (just $20 more than the LaQuinta for my entire 5-night stay), I was very pleased. The hotel is situated about 1 to 1.5 miles away from International Drive so if you don't have a rent-a-car don't even bother. However, I loved the peace and serenity of the area so if you do have a rent-a-car...Go for it! The fitness room housed about 6 exercise machines (Precor brand) and a nice selection of dumbbells. I'm an Exercise Physiologist so this part of the hotel experience is very important to me as I exercise regularly. The food at the restaurant was terrific and reasonably priced. Breakfast was great with a great variety of food (I loved the vegetable egg white omelet for breakfast and the grilled chicken sandwich for dinner). All the restaurant staff was pleasant and very accommodating especially the dinner crew. A couple of mistakes were made with my order on separate occasions, but the staff corrected the situation with a smile. Did I mentioned the fresh coffee that's available all day?

Apparently the only working computer couldn't search google maps and print my key simultaneously. 10 mins later we had a key. \" how about the breakfast coupons\" i asked \" ooh i will send someone right up with them. I wasnt about to wait longer headed up to room. Whole ordeal was Pretty strange but ooh well. Once in the room, Noticed the bed was stuck on the 'ultra stiff' setting, regardless of where dial was. I jumped on the bed, adjusted the dial, no dice. ( most who have stayed at a hgi know the drill). I stopped by the desk on way out to dinner and asked for new room and the breakfast coupons that never showed. Coincidentally we waited in line behind a guy with same bed problem, as desk agent explained how to use bed. \"try it again they said\". He left dejected. \"hi, I understand beds, and ours is broken. \"ok we will send maintenance and if they can't fix we will put you in another room\". Confident the bed was broken I was pretty sure we would come back to a new room. What we came back to was disappointment. No one had ever gone up to the room, and now (five hours later) they were full. When I really lost it, was when he offered me free breakfast to make up for their blunder. \"dude I have free breakfast already, how many you want me to eat, by the way did those coupons ever make it too room?\". \"It says here they did sir\" he replied. They sent maintenance up to room to \"fix bed\". Turns out he didn't even know where dial was. Perplexed I showed him and asked \"ever fix one of these?\" his response \"Nope, never seen one.\". That's when I noticed \"security\" emblazoned across his back. \"man that thing is hard as a log. You are right. You can't sleep on that\" were his words on way out \"ok thanks for trying\". I said as I picked up phone to call desk. We did sleep on it. Hard as a log and all. Manager comped room in am. All in all room was nice minus bed. But whole ordeal was off enough that I will never stay at that one again. And will think long and hard about a hgi again. Most Hampton inns and courtyards are just as nice and no possibility for broken bed as they are just normal. Ooh well.

Upon our arrival I instantly had an allergic reaction to the room, something I have never experienced in my extensive travels. The air in the room literally made my eyes watery and red; the bedding smelled as if it had been cleaned in a vat of caustic chemicals. It was a clean room, the hotel itself being under two years old; and it was an average hotel room, being not too small. However, this was clearly not up to Hilton standards. I have to admit I have never stayed at a Hilton Garden hotel before, my experience with Hilton has always been their \"regular\" properties (and I always try to stay at Hilton because of their quality). If this represents what their Garden properties are like I will never choose another - ever. The room was clean, and contained all the amenities advertised, however the bed (the most important part of the room) was terrible. I'm no princess, but when I stay at a Hilton I expect certain things: quality of service (which this hotel had in abundance), and quality of bedding (which left me very ill). I seriously thought I was going to have to see a doctor or find a different hotel because of the horrible reaction I had to the bedding. The duvet and pillows were filled with feathers; I have never had a reaction to feathers so I did not request a hypo-allergenic room. I will in the future. After one night of sleeping on those god-awful pillows my eyes were extremely red, itchy and watery, my throat was closing up and I felt I couldn't get air into my lungs. After a solid week of sleeping in that atmosphere I could not wait to leave. I also picked up some kind of intestinal virus that had me vomitting and \"other \" delightful things which, according to a member of the staff, was \"going around, everyone's got it here.\" Lovely. Not. We got up early and hit the parks and the fresh air and sunshine worked wonders on my condition, however we'd arrive back at the hotel and instantly my body would react: red, itchy, watery eyes, scratchy throat, and my lungs felt like I'd never get enough air in them. I had a very difficult week of trying to sleep and had to use Advil PM several nights just to get enough sleep. The staff was wonderful - Kevin the bartender is an awesome guy, the women who ran the breakfast were equally wonderful and friendly. The main desk staff was overworked at times and slow to answer the phone, however one person manning the main desk had their hands full. Even though pantry items were expensive they were less costly than buying stuff in the parks; recommend buying up several bottles of water there and take them with you to the parks, as $2.50 for a bottle at the hotel was cheaper by far than the $3.50 bottle in Disney. You can bring backpacks with water and snack foods into the parks, so do it! The cost of the room was adequate, however another Hilton property within the Disney hotel band was the same rate with 100% higher quality. I'd stayed at that other property before but could not get a room this trip - in comparison - for the money - the other Hilton was far superior in the quality of the room and the overall stay. This Hilton - the Garden Inn on Marbella Parkway - was more like a Holiday Inn. Infact, I believe the Holiday Inn express down the street would have been a better choice for several reasons: they offered free breakfast, and were very close to the Crossroads where all the restaurants and shops are located. Breakfast at the Hilton Garden was pretty good - the cost was great as everything in Orlando is horribly expensive, so $6.95 for continental breakfast and $8.95 for full breakfast was very cost effective, however the Hilton Garden Inn was not near anything so you had little choice where to eat or drink for other meals; it was a taxi ride or a bus ride to anywhere you wanted to go. They are only about 18 months old as of this writing, so they do have some \"bugs\" to iron out, but unless they change the way they clean the bedding, or change the bedding all together, they will never have me as a guest again. Note: the Links bus system is the way to go if you don't rent a car in Orlando, research it before you go to the area as it is $2 for one ride or $4.50 for the entire day of transferring from one bus to the other to go all over Orlando; taxis charge $15+ for oneway from this hotel to the Downtown Disney area and $25 to any of the parks. The bus was $2. A no-brainer there... doesn't go to the major parks but the hotel offers a shuttle. About the shuttle: I read a complaint on this site about the shuttle service before we left and chalked it up to just a complainer who couldn't be satisfied. I was wrong. The shuttle system was very limited. Three pick-up times in the morning, and three drop- off times in the evening. I was attending classes so I couldn't hop a shuttle after class to meet up with my spouse at the parks; we had to meet at the hotel, and didn't want to pay for a taxi to the parks. If the shuttle had been available at those times we'd have gone to the parks for the evening. The bus driver the first few days was nicknamed Grumpy because of his nasty disposition; we noticed he wasn't around the rest of the week and were glad. They work on tips, so you'd expect a nicer driver. Go figure. He was rude and nasty. The other drivers were very nice, however. But the pick up times were not very convenient. Not the hotel's fault, however this is the service with which they contract. Get to know the Epcot shuttle system well before you go, as you need to catch either a bus, boat or monorail to go to the other parks from Epcot. The shuttle system from the Hilton Garden only takes you to Epcot, which is the central hub for the Disney parks (all the shuttles work this way). Take the earliest bus out (7:55am); the parks mostly open between 8am-9am. For the rest of the hotel: the pool was tiny, but it was open until 10pm with bar and restaurant walk-up service. You share it with another property, the Residence Inn. The restaurant had adequate food - not great, but not awful either. Priced within means, didn't break the bank for meals. The bar was small but Kevin the bartender was excellent. Overall I was disappointed in this hotel property. Not worthy of \"Hilton\" status, but not a terrible hotel.

Our criteria for selecting the Hilton Garden Inn was as follows: 1 - transportation to/from Epcot Food/Wine Festival, 2 - free hotel parking, 3 - online hotel reviews, 4 - price, and 5 - brand recognition. Upon arrival at the hotel at 10:35 a.m. we were informed that the shuttle departed to the park at 10:20 a.m. and that the following shuttle would depart at 12:30 p.m. Rather than spend 2 hours waiting for the next shuttle we opted to absorb the fare for a one way taxi ($25) and start our day. (I was disappointed that the website made no mention of the limited/fixed scheduled departures.) My assumption or expectation for shuttle service would have been departures either each half hour, on the hour, or as needed courtesy car/van ride departures for guests that arrive throughout the day. I accept fault for assuming the infrequency of \"complimentary\" rides and for not calling ahead to check. Per the return shuttle service schedule, we were to meet the shuttle at the Epcot Center Transportation area at 9:45 p.m. Never having used a shuttle service before, to any theme park, we returned to the location where the taxi dropped us off - again, assuming the hotels used the same parking lot as all other public transportation carriers (i.e. taxis, shuttles) for pickup at the \"Disney Transportation and Ticketing Center.\" We arrived there via monorail at around 9:35 p.m. and immediately called the front desk at the hotel to determine the pickup location. We spent a few minutes on the phone, walking around, and asking other drivers present where we needed to be. After a day long of drinking (alcohol), eating, walking, etc., it was a careless (and honest) mistake to not locate the \"Epcot Center Transportation\" area; however, having never used a shuttle service before, we were unaware that Epcot had its own parking/pickup area separate from the Disney Ticketing and Transportation Center - the assumption being that all public transportation occurs at one location. What's more frustrating was that the receptionist at the front desk of the hotel was unable to tell us where we needed to go or where we needed to be for the shuttle pickup thus we missed the pickup time. Needless to say, we ended up paying another $25 to catch a ride back to the hotel. Between the cab fares and hotel rate, we should have just stayed on Disney property where they are far more concerned with customer service and satisfaction. The ball drop occurred when we arrived at the hotel to check in and speak to the manager regarding the miscommunicated advertisement regarding \"complimentary\" transportation. It was neither convenient nor was there any indication of schedule departure times on the website. Given that the hotel staff was unable to tell us where we needed to be causing us to miss our \"free\" ride back, I found it unnecessary that we should have to cover the return trip cost. The \"best\" the manager could do for us was to cancel our reservation without charge. Outstanding attention to customer service Hilton especially after a long day. \"Allow\" your guest to cancel their reservation without offering anything to keep us as a customer was an easy out for not having to deal with an upset customer. A free breakfast voucher for the morning after would have been sufficient. (Breakfast is not free FYI.) Having to get in a car in Orlando at 10 p.m., exhausted, upset, after a \"Food/Wine\" event, to look for someplace else to stay was by far the biggest insult and contradicting to the service the hotel provides. Needless to say, you've lost a customer for life. As a paying customer, I reserve the right to choose where I stay and who I share my experience with - forever.

This hotel is located on an isolated road about 3-5 miles away from Downtown Disney. It is on a road with about 3 other hotels in the middle of nowhere. I guess they started to build a hotel community and it kind of flopped or just hasn't developed yet. Don't get me wrong, you're still really close to the back entrance of Disney but it isn't within walking distance of anything. Check in was very quick and easy. Room was very clean but the bed was extremely hard. I did not sleep well at all. The hotel appears fairly new so it is quite clean. My other complaint is that there is no back entrance to the hotel, only the front door so if you have to park out back you can't go in a back door to get out of rain or anything. They have doors that enter conference rooms but those are locked so you can't use them. Hotel advertises \"Disney View\" rooms, I didn't stay in one but trust me there is no way you are seeing anything at Disney from this hotel. Hotel advertises proximity keys so that you don't have to swipe anything to open your room but you still have to swipe the key right on top of the reader for it to open the door.

Our room was a traditional Hilton Garden Inn room, not too spacious. Our room had a small fridge and a microwave. Our first night after spending the day at Disney, we went down to the pool area for the hot tub. The hallway to get to the pool on the first floor is also where some of the hotel rooms are. The carpet smelled like mildew, we figured because of people walking in wet from the pool. Also the hot tub smelled like there was too much soap mixed it. It wasn't very relaxing since it didn't smell good. The pool was also not heated. They did provide towels by the pool which was nice. The pool was also open until 10. We suggested to the front desk to consider extending the hours, so people coming from Disney parks can go a relax. Another inconvience was when housekeeping only gave us two new towels and no new bath mat, with four people staying in the room. We had to call the front desk at 11pm to get more. Usually it wouldn't be a big deal, but after spending all day at Disney it was a bit of hassel. Breakfast was $8.95 for buffet style and a chef that cooks omlets and eggs. There were plenty of options and they even had Belgian waffles in the shape of Mickey Mouse which was a nice touch. The handicap room was very spacious and perfect for an eldery relative that needed the space. Our day of check-out was a Sunday morning. Our room was on the second floor so the elevator was full on it's way up or down so we ended up standing with all of our luggage for 10 minutes waiting on an open elevator.

I am a regular user of Hilton hotels and prefer the Garden Inns for their cleanliness, attention to detail and accommodations that appease to business travelers. However, even though I booked a room here, I wouldn't be able to tell you what it was like. Upon arrival to this hotel, at 8:00 PM, I was greeted by a maintenance worker who told me that he would try and find someone to check me in. After 5 minutes the manager (Bill or Bob?) finally arrived and checked me in. He was very unprofessional, especially for being a manager, which foreshadowed nicely what happened next. After completing check-in, I headed to my room and started opening the door when I heard a scream. The manager had given me a room with someone already in it!!!! After apologizing to the poor people in \"my\" room I headed back downstairs. I explained what had happened and the manager was more concerned with trying to figure out who to blame, than apologizing to me and the embarrassment I had just gone through. After looking in his computer he explained that the hotel was sold out and I couldn't get a room, even though I had a confirmation of my reservation. The manager then explained that they were going to \"upgrade\" me to the Homewood Suites. His attempt at trying to sugar coat the situation did not make me happy. Homewood Suites is not an upgrade to the Hilton Garden Inn, especially for a business traveler. Maybe it is an upgrade if you are a family and need a kitchen and an extra room. There is a reason why the rate is slightly more expensive at Homewood, because a room can sleep 7 people. Having no other options, I took the room at the Homewood suites and it was less than average compared to the hundreds of hotels that I have stayed at. My stay was capped off nicely when I reached for a fresh towel that was covered in yellow stains. My advice\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6if you book a room at this hotel, make sure that you will actually get it when you show up. There are millions of hotels in Florida and about 30 others within 2 miles of this place. You might want to try another one. Also, some of the resorts in the area are discounting their rates because of the lower tourism rates in the Orlando area.

Normally it's about $10 for breakfast. That price was included in our stay. The only problem is that at rush hour, there's a massive line to order eggs. There's one egg guy with 3 pans juggling orders for custom eggs. It took us forever to get to the front and the kids were going crazy. Everything here was self service, not worth the $10 for a very limited buffet. The staff was overworked and constantly behind in everything. The waffle batter ran out and took them 15 minutes to replace it after about 3 reminders. What to do? I had a 5 year old that was demanding waffles!!! Not a good start to the day - we wasted a lot of time for a disappointing breakfast. I recommend not getting the breakfast, unless there's no line with the egg guy.
