The hotel did not have our room available and only had a room available with one bed, despite the fact that we were charged extra for choosing a room with two beds. The receptionist refused to let me talk to her manager over this and told me that I should have called the hotel ahead of time to confirm that the specific room had been available. Our room was extremely noisy. The heating was really loud, and we could not sleep at night with the fan on. And it was freezing cold when we turned it off. Moreover, there is a night club right next to the hotel that got pretty loud. And finally, our room was next to the dining area, and we were awoken at 6 am by noise from other guests and staff. While our room had two telephones, a TV and a coffee-maker, it didn't have a closet or any other place to hang our clothes! Moreover, there was a four foot-high pile of trash right in front of the hotel entrance.

Staying at this hotel was ok. the staff was very friendly and helpful. the location is great. walking distance to restaurants, bars and shopping. Timesquares main attractions are a few blocks over so it was great. one downside though is that its right next door to a nite club so wen u get home late at night there is drunk people right outside your hotels front entrance door. kinda scary for 2 girls from texas traveling alone. also the rooms are tiny. would have been perfect had we not had luggage but of course we did. there was no room to even walk about the room to get dressed. we did ask for a bigger room but there was no availability. there is 4 rooms to a floor and the corner rooms are smaller than the other 2. the front desk attendant was very helpful and even tried to switch our rooms to accomodate us but with no luck. she also mentioned that most rooms in most hotels are the same size. i guess NYC hotels build up instead of out and that is why thier rooms are so narrow. Also before i forget the AC/heater unit is right below the window and the bed is against the window covering the unit so the AC/heater blows directly to the bed. kinda sucked. i visited another hotel with a friend and it was just as small so good luck. travel light. Other than that it was good. there is a concierge in the lobby ready to book your tours if your interested. we took several tours. i recommend the Top of the Rock tour. it took us every where we wanted to visit. statue of liberty, central park, soho, Rockfeller Center, etc. it was great and very inexpensive.

Thankfully, we stumbled into this Comfort Inn! Found it on hotels.com and gave it a go. Before I could even get the words out of my mouth, the receptionist Shivani had us booked into our room at the advertised rate! No hassle like our previous hotel! Also, my cousin who was with me had his dog with him & the staff was very kind in acomodating our puppy. Not the easiest thing in NY! So for the 3 days we were there, we had a great rate, a great location (off of Times Square enough to avoid getting immediately sucked into the crowds), & great service (the staff was friendly & professional throughout our stay!) The management even allowed us to use the lounge/cafeteria area to do a dry run for my show. Not every place would ok with that! The one big con of the location are the slow internet access (don't expect to be streaming videos). So to sum up, our stay was a memorable one for the right reasons! A decent room at an excellent (by NY standards) price in a good location! If you're traveling through NY for a couple days, I would recommend this place!

Spacious bathroom (although the bathroom didn't get any heat -- BRR!) that was clean, had plenty of hot water and excellent water pressure. I've seen luke-warm reviews about their continental breakfast. Word to the wise: go early. The food is good, warm, and there's an excellent selection. Seating is super-limited though and it gets crowded quick especially if there are kids running about. Free coffee is available ALL DAY which is a super-nice feature. The location was prime. We took the Lincoln Tunnel into the city and upon exiting the Tunnel, we were practically at the hotel's doorstep. AWESOME. We were only a couple blocks from everything we wanted to see. The hotel felt very safe and was well-kept. Only 2 \"negatives\" ... 1) There is no Comfort Inn parking garage. There's an Icon garage across the street and it's about $40 for 24 hours. Super-convenient, super-fast, super-friendly. But it's $40 for 24 hours. Welcome to New York! and 2) Occasionally a strange sound would come from the air vent in our bathroom. I called the front desk and they said there was something about air pockets in the vents when it gets really cold outside. We only heard it twice, and not for any long duration. HUGE \"positive\" ...

It was too late to cancel the reservation after I realised my mistake, since I had opted for a non-refundable rate. Was a tad worried after reading the reviews here, but it all worked out pretty well. First off, let me say that I paid about US$250 a night for the room with two double beds for FOUR people, which is actually really cheap for the Times Square area in Manhattan. The room was small (even more so when you have four people), but at least it was clean and served its purpose (we needed only a place to sleep in and were never around during the day). The bathroom door didn't lock properly (no biggie) but that was the only problem we encountered. Shower worked fine, and water temperature and pressure were great. We stayed here over a weekend, and it was hard getting to sleep on Saturday night because the hotel is right next to a male strip club and the club's patrons were outside making a lot of noise way after midnight. Then again, we had a room on the second floor facing the street, so perhaps getting a room on the other side of the hotel might have helped. Breakfast was nothing much to shout about - pastries, juice, sausages - and the dining area was small and crowded (you might have to take food back to your room). The reception area is small and there is usually only one person at the counter, which means you might have to wait in line for a while. The check-in process took a while, but the staff was courteous and friendly, and gave us all the information (breakfast hours, wifi password) without us asking. You'd be hard pressed to find a hotel room at this rate around the same area in Manhattan. So while this wasn't a great hotel, I'd still recommend it for a short stay if you don't intend to stay in your room all the time (and who does in New York?) based on the fact that it's very affordable.

The one negative comment I would have is the size of the breakfast room, which I can see would be difficult for the hotel to change! We intended to take advantage of the free breakfast but couldn't bear to squeeze into the crowded room, and the bedrooms are really too small to take food into, so we treated ourselves to a nearby diner.

Skylar's rudeness and unwillingness to honor Choice Hotel's satisfaction guarantee was the straw that broke the camel's back. We asked to check out and not be charged for the 3 nights we had booked.

We were there 5 days every day fresh linen was in carts parked near the entrance of the hotel. Yes linen outside on a cart all day and all night I guess because it was always there. More linen and cleaning carts in the emergency stairwell. I am not sure but could imagine that would be illegal. The breakfast room I believe had 3 tables maybe 4 never really used the area other than to get coffee because I just didn't want to stand in the heat to eat breakfast. The place was always elbow to elbow and they were out of coffee two days and out of cups two days. If you want to wait awhile it will show up eventually. Now we are in the room. Rooms are very small, among the smallest I have ever had. Furniture is fair and the room is and was kept clean. First night the room had no toilet paper, hair dryer, and no TV remote. Some of that was fixed on the second day but never got a hair dryer. The second night we had no towels but they were aware of that and they made the delivery of the last two towels in the hotel to our room. Most importantly the rooms were quiet, the bed very comfortable and the air conditioning was great. Like I mentioned the room was clean, mostly. Those days there was no coffee in the basement there was a 4 cup maker in the room. There was always fresh coffee available but the maid never emptied the pot or toss the grounds. The neighborhood is obviously in transition there are 4 nearly new hotels on the block between 8th and 9th Ave. There is however almost that number of vacant buildings or buildings being torn down there also.

The breakfast which was the standard Comfort Inn buffet breakfast met our needs - even 4 bagels and juice in Times Square would be costly. The kids filled up on good stuff, yogurt, fruit.

The rooms and bathrooms were clean. The sheets and towels were changed and made everyday. Everything seems compact but it even had an exercisse room with ellipticals and treadmills. There was also an office room with free computer, internet, and printing access! There was 24-hour coffee service in the lounge/breakfast room. For the price of the hotel, I could not have asked for more. I was actually VERY pleased for the price and the value that Comfort Inn gave, including free breakfast. For the size of the building, I think Comfort Inn Times Square planned the space and building as best they could. Everything seems a little compact; hallways, elevators, gym room, computer room, and rooms (probably half the size what you would expect from the Hilton or Hyatt), but my husband and I do not take up too much space all in all. :) But my emphasize here is the best value all around on a limited budget. The Comfort Inn building is an older but very nice building whose architecture conforms to that of the rest of New York City architecture (the intricate carvings on the facade). I'm sure the building has a rich history as most of the buildings in Manhattan. The best part is, it's half a block from the epic Times Square! The next best part is, it's near all the public transportation, both the busses and subways, all heading in both directions, Queens, Bronx, and Brooklyn. Half a block towards the east, subways B, D, F, M; One block towards the west (in Times Square), subways N, Q, R are all available, within 1-2 blocks walking distance. My husband and I bought a 7-day Metro card that took us from Times Square to Central Park, downtown Manhattan, Queens, Coney Island, and everything in between. You can also take the subway to Bronx and Brooklyn but didn't have a chance. If you're looking to go on a trip to NY with a tight budget, I would recommend Comfort Inn Times Square.

Therefore marks for Cleanliness, Location, Rooms, and Sleep Quality have been rated as Average. The reason why I am writing this negative review is due to their reservation policy, of which I have encountered today (one month prior to date of stay). I was originally planning to stay in NYC for 3 nights, therefore I made a reservation at the 'Comfort Inn Times Square'. Upon being informed I needed to stay one additional night, I simply googled 'Comfort Inn Times Square', and made the reservation. Little did I realise (as someone is not familiar with the area), that I had actually reserved a room with 'Comfort Inn Times Square South'. Aware of my blunder, I had phoned CI - South. The worker had said, \"Not a problem to cancel and get your refund, just call in the morning, 'cause you need my manager.\" So, as instructed, I had phone the next day. When speaking with the manager, I was told that no refund could be made, nor could I have my reservation transferred to 'Comfort Inn Times Square'. Basically, the best management could do was to re-arrange the date of my stay within the next 2 months. By the way, this is only the 2nd time I'm coming to NYC in 36 years... I'm sure I won't visit within the next 2 months. It's not like I don't want to give my money to Comfort Inn, I just don't want to have to shift hotels for just one night!!! Again, the blunder, confusing: \"Comfort Inn Times Square\" \"Comfort Inn Times Square - South\" I'm admitting fault for mixing them up, but as someone who isn't familiar with NYC hotels, is it that difficult to switch from one Comfort Inn to another?

Booked in, the staff were lovely and very friendly. I specifically requested a high floor as I had been to New York before and knew this could be an advantage. We entered our hotel room which was a twin. The furniture was shabby, scratched and very tired and outdated to say I was disappointed would be an understatement. However, the room and bathroom were clean. The hotel windows could open but the noise was incredible, you expect it in New York but where the hotel was situated seemed worse and the windows could have benefited from more noise proof. The hotel provided a free breakfast which was very nice. It was a basic buffet choice of cakes, pastries, waffles, cereal juices and hot drinks. This was a godsend and I couldn't find fault. I personally wouldn't use this hotel again for the price I paid. It's cheap and cheerful but only if you get it at a cheap price is it worth it. If you don't mind basic and tired and are just looking for a bed to rest your head then it's okay.

It is good value for money right in midtown Manhattan. With just a little more attention to easily modified details, this hotel could be so much better. The rooms we saw vary quite a bit in terms of layout and furnishings - each with its pluses and minuses - each just missing the mark. Hanging space in all the rooms was inadequate as was shelf space in the bathrooms. Housekeeping, too, was inconsistent. We had booked three rooms for the three of us. On our first night we were given the two basement rooms and one (of the two available) on the ground floor. The basement rooms had been recently flooded and the carpets were wringing wet and smelling. Reception staff seemed unaware of their condition until we told them. We were offered three rooms at a location in Long Island City for the night with the promise of acceptable rooms at West 39th Street the next day. We took the offer and were transported to Long Island and back free of charge. Next day we got the new rooms and were given credit on the two basement rooms for the night lost. Of course, we lost the holiday time involved in negotiation and travel. You might think our experience would have put us off using this hotel again; nothing could be further from the truth. From the second night on we had a great stay, mostly because of the first class reception and concierge staff who were friendly, helpful and anxious to do what they could to ensure we had a good time in Manhattan.

There was variety and it was enough to start the day right. Try to be in the dining area before 8 am if you want a table to sit at, worst case scenario you can just take your plate back to your room- no big deal. It's true that there are rooms on the ground floor. We found this a bit strange. We arrived late on our first night and had a choice between ground floor or basement. We decided on a basement room, and there were no disturbances at all. The receptionist did say we could switch the next morning at around 10 or 11 am, but we ended up staying in the same one because it was fine. The room was a bit on the small side but not small enough that it felt like a closet (why would you care about room size if you are in an exciting city like New York??)

The answer to this, staying at this hotel is a definate no, you are really close to Times Square. Our break was 5 nights B&B. We got the bus from Newark Airport (cost $25 return per person. Would cost $15 one way) and got off at the Port Authority Bus Depot. It literally is a 5 minute easy walk to the hotel and a waste of money if you were to use a taxi. The hotel had construction work on going outside but this did not impact on our stay. We got a twin bed room on the 10th floor and it was small but functional, given the limited time we were in the room. The bathroom was a good size and had shower, bath and washbasin. There was a hairdryer there as well. (Remember to take an adapter for phone chargers, hair straightners etc). There was not a lot of wardrobe space so we tended to leave stuff in the cases. There was an iron and board although we never used it. Tea coffee making was also provided. Breakfast was on level 1 and consisted of a wide selection of pastries, freshly made muffins, cereals, fresh fruit and tea coffee and fruit juices. The eating area was small but functional and you could take food back to your room. We ate breakfast two mornings but ended up going for breakfast at a place called Tick Tock which is near Madison Square Gardens. There are so many things to do and places to eat that you will not be stuck for choice. At the end of our stay we kept the room for $50 as it needed to be vacated by 11.00am and our flight was not until 7.50pm. The hotel staff explained we had two choices. 1- We vacate the room by 11.00am and they would look after our luggage. 2- We pay $50 dollars and keep the room until 7pm. We decided the latter and we were glad we did as my wife and daughter did not feel like going out and about the last day. If I was returning to New York I would use this hotel again.

Some rooms overlook the current Times newspaper offices and the main bus terminal (which makes it convenient for buses, a taxi dispatch and several subway lines - stations for various lines are interconnected by underground walkways there). The neighbourhood isn't great looking though there are some well run deli's and coffee shops nearby. I read somewhere (Choice hotels site?) that the hotel has a restaurant - they must have mixed that up as it doesn't, thought there are places to eat nearby. We've been to New York before and know hotels are pretty expensive there, like many other big cities where real estate is at a premium. We got a good rate (for the date) via Quick Book and stayed a whole week at this property. We paid a bit more per night than on previous trips, but the room was a whole lot better, and there were more facilities including breakfast. The first room we were allocated wasn't the type we booked, but I got the duty manager to change it as we wanted a king size and just one bed. The 4th floor room was clean, modern and well appointed with a good TV, safe large enough for a laptop plus cameras, passports etc. The rooms are however small and there's isn't a lot of space for luggage - you have to be disciplined with your stuff. The bathroom was fine - clean and everything worked well including the shower (to operate the shower you have to pull down on a small ring on the end of the bath tub faucet/tap spout which can be confusing). I used the free wifi successfully several times with both a laptop and a wifi phone. Connection speed was OK. You have to get the access code from reception. We had no trouble sleeping. The bed was very comfortable, the aircon worked if you wanted it, you could open the window for fresh air (though that made it a little noisy with the sounds of the city). I asked about a refrigerator/microwave but apparently they only had 3 rooms with those facilities, which were all in use. In the end we didn't need them, and chilled a bottle of wine using the ice bucket. We had a few minor niggles during our stay, but most of these were dealt with by the front desk staff - the maid took the complimentary newspaper away before we had a chance to read it, the phone wouldn't allow me to make a local call and so on. Be aware that there may be a small daily charge if you use the safe. The breakfast was good, with a selection of cakes and pastries, cereal, juice and waffles. The breakfast room, in the basement, is small but adequate. Some problems come from how guests behave and use it, with some folks choosing to sit long after they have finished eating, seemingly oblivious to other guests waiting. It pays to get in there early if possible, and you can always grab something and take it back to your room. Tea/coffee were available there 24/7 along with complimentary snack bars. There were also vending machines and a ice maker. There was also a coffee machine in the room and the maid left enough for a couple of cups each day. Bottled water was also provided in the room some days. All the staff at the hotel were great, particularly the guy running the breakfast room. The front entrance and lobby weren't great to look at, particularly as there was construction work going on when we were there, and you sometimes get bags of trash piled up, but it's functional. There's a concierge desk available for booking tours, tickets and transportation, though we didn't use it. There's a small waiting area in the lobby and the staff will hold luggage for you.

We arrived on a Saturday night, greeted by an enormous pile of black rubbish bags and 'Escuelitas', the nightclub next door, in full swing. There were lots of the club kids hanging around by the hotel entrance. The entrance & reception area of the hotel are dirty & small. Our room was located in the basement, where you could hear the music from the nightclub, thumping through the walls. It also stank of damp, & was tiny. There was the bed, & room for me to walk in front of it & down one side. The walls were marked & dirty, with torn portions of wallpaper. The bed cover had large stains on it including (I hope) what looked like some sort of blue candle wax. How anyone is supposed to sleep in this room is beyond me. The tv had no remote, there were no bin liners in the bins and there were no opening windows, but there was a balcony door, which, when I asked, I was given a key to. However, the air con system chucks out warm air here, into a dirty smelly courtyard. The smell was bad. We shut the door again and braved the damp smell inside. The bathroom, was actually clean, and of a surprisingly high standard when compared with the room itself. We asked to be moved, but the hotel was full. The staff said they would relocate us the next day. We attempted to use the kitchen facilities to make some food & discovered tomorrows breakfast, sitting (bagged) on the floor in a dirty closet. The plates were made of polysterene & mine actually melted from a piece of toast sitting on it. The kitchen & cleaning cupboards were both on our floor, so after a night of trying to sleep, we were disturbed all morning by people coming to use facilities, and the cleaning cupboards which are also on that floor. The staff knocked twice within an hour, wanting to relocate us. Clearly all we wanted to do was sleep, but this was never going to happen. We were VERY tired. We had had a long flight the night before. This was our first New York experience. We also had no idea of real day light, or the weather from this low level room, making it even harder to get motivated. We relocated to a room on much higher level (16?). The view, of all the buildings, and dirty, treeless streets was actually quite depressing, but any lower floors on the same side would have had a view of a car park below. The window at least opened a crack, but again, the bed sheets were dirty & smelt disgusting, I mean AWFUL-no way was I sleeping in them tonight. They brought us our own refrigerator & microwave so we could avoid the kitchen level, but by then I had discovered the bathroom door did not shut, the shower head was broken, still no bin liners in the bins & I had just had enough of this hotel now. We spent the day finding another hotel, and relocating. This meant coming back for our things & asking to be transferred (to another Comfort Inn). They said they would charge us for both nights & that a transfer was not possible due to the hotels bring under different management. (If we had booked through an agent it was apparently possible). We were told we would have to come back the following day to discuss this with management, & ask for our money back. The manager was currently unavailable. Our first day in New York was ruined by lack of sleep, money spent on around town & worrying about finding another available hotel. We DID get all our money back for the nights charged. But it took a lot of time, effort & wasting the precious time we had in the city, & were not compensated for that.

After this you walk through to the reception area which is more dirty than any i have ever known i really wanted to wash my hands after touching any thing in that room.

So up the lift i went to the 14th floor hallway was clean so that was a good point. Into the room well when i say room more like a cupboard i thought it was going to be small but a place for the suitcase would of been nice then to top it all off looked out of the window into the building opposite you could see what was on there computers so you need to leave the blind down all day which does not help when you feel your in a prison cell any way.

The only other down side was the extra taxes added to the bill it was about $40 extra a day so you will need to take this into account when booking.", "Date": "September 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottinghamshire", "Title": "\u201cGood Location and clean\u201d", "Author": "littleaddo", "ReviewID": "UR19874293", "Content": "This hotel is in a good location - only a few blocks from Times Square and subways nearby.

There is a coffee maker and ice bucket, no fridge and a pay safe. Reception will store your luggage securely on your last day. Breakfast was actually quite good - good coffee and they make fresh waffles for you, and if you can catch the breakfast room when its empty then even better, however there are only 14 seats in here and around 60 rooms so when full that could mean 120 people competing for 14 places!! We grabbed coffee/croissants some days and took them up to our room. The club next door is a latino club and is called Escuelita - really nothing to worry about and no noise heard. Had a great view of the New York Times building from our 15th floor room. Great location for Times Square, theatre district and 42nd Street, the hotel itself is in the Garment district, which is full of material shops/wholesalers. If you head up a few blocks to 46th street (between 8th and 9th ave) this street is full of nice restaurants which we didnt find until the last night - should have looked in our guide book sooner -much cheaper and better food than the ones on Broadway or around Times Square. Also Chevy's Fresh Mex Mexican on 42nd Street (between 7th and 8th) was a really good mexican - it looks like a chain restaurant but it was great and the staff were fantastic. Getting to JFK is really easy on the E line towards Jamaica ($2) - its really obvious where to get off and the airtrain ($5) comes every 2 minutes and couldn't be any easier.

I stayed with my 14 year old daughter and some other family members were on a different floor. We never heard any noise from other rooms or from the club.

When we arrived we were greeted by the staff and the hotel had been booked and paid for in the UK before arrival. I was told that the room had NOT been reserved for us despite having a receipt to confirm this. Having showed them the receipt they then allocated us with a room. The room itself was small and not ideal for 3 females with suitcases, despite it being a 2x doublebed room. We were tripping over our suitcases throughout the stay! Not ideal! On day 2, after returning from a day out, we return to find we had been locked out of our room. We asked reception about this, who said it was an error and then reprogrammesd our key to let us in, 10 mins later they call to advise we have not paid our room and would have to pay again! I refuse and tell them to liaise with the booking agent as they had already taken payment. They refuse to make the call to the UK to resolve the problem and kept demanding for us to pay in full again! The manager himself was very cocky to say the least and very unhelpful. In the end, he calls the UK after standing there for 30mins demanding he speaks to the booking agent. The booking agent gives him company credit card details to pay for the hotel, but the manager refuses to take the details saying he needs it in writing and it MUST be faxed to him! This annoyed me to say the least as the booking agent was giving him details to make the payment! This ruined our whole evening worrying about whether this issue would be resolved. None of the staff members bothered to tell us the following morning that the whole issue had been resolved! I had to constantly ask and the answer I always got was - I dont know, someone else is dealing with this matter. I will get them to call you. Least to say this matter was between the booking agent and the hotel! We should not have been involved to this extent. Not only did this ruin our holiday, but we never even got an apology for all the hassles this has caused!

We suffered a bad traumatic experience which i have to highlight here. We booked through the hotel Concierge and paid $64 ( Receipt J 14359 ) for a shuttle bus ( operated by Apple Commuter Company INC ) for 4 leaving at 5.25pm on 12 Jun to bring us to the JFK airport. Halfway the bus broke down and we were left stranded in the middle of the road. There were another dozen or so pax on the bus.The driver did not bother to help us or give any instructions as to how we could get to the airport.We had to wait for more than 30 mins before a private cab stopped to pick us to the airport. As it was near our departure time, the 30 mins wait was traumatic and very stressful for fear of missing the flight as we cannot afford a delay back home. We had to pay 3 times the normal fare demanded by the cab driver.We had to dash to check in and my wife fell and suffered bruises on the arms and legs herself. I have sent a email to the hotel asking for a refund of the shuttle fare and cab fare and compensation for duress and trauma suffered as a result of the breakdown of the Bus but to date I have received no response.
