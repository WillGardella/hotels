I was certainly not disappointed. Walking to the hotel from Gare du Nord took no more than 10 minutes. The reception staff were professional and welcoming.The room was clean and stylish and slightly bigger than I had expected ( bearing in mind that rooms in Paris are reasonably compact, unless you want to pay significant amounts of money). The breakfast was more than acceptable with fresh juices, bread, croissants and pastries as well as a good choice teas and coffees. The recommendation of Trip Advisor guests was certainly justified and the hotel can properly be proud of the fact that it consistently meets clients expectations. Good value rooms, cleanliness and being close to the Metro and Gare du Nord and Gare d' Est allows the hotel to be proud of its \"Certificat D' Excellence\".", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma City, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cTrip of a Lifetime\u201d", "Author": "Patrick O", "ReviewID": "UR126177879", "Content": "Our stay at Hotel Soft was amazing.

The hotel has a clean, modern feel to it. It is easy to reach from the Gare du Nord (we walked straight there in 10 minutes rather than going two stops on the Metro). The hotel is on a side road off the main busy boulevard, but it was surprisingly quiet in the rooms despite being so close to traffic. The room was compact with an en-suite shower room, don't expect lots of space but what you do get is well laid out and kept very clean with daily housekeeping. Plenty of room for two suitcases and there was a handy safe in the room, too. There was a useful hairdryer in the bathroom, the only thing missing really was tea/coffee making facilities in the room, which you get used to having in the UK! Other reviewers have commented that the rooms are warm, heating in our room was controlled by a radiator and we were glad of the heat in sub-zero winter temperatures, but I could imagine it could be a bit warm in the summer. The breakfast is plentiful (it was included in our holiday deal) with lovely pastries and ham. I would recommend getting down to breakfast earlier rather than later, the waiting staff are very nice, but not very quick at clearing up the tables in the small eating area for further people to sit down. Staff were generally friendly and helpful, we were able to leave our luggage until 4pm on the day we left so that we could see a bit more of Paris. The night staff in particular are lovely.

Decoration is nice and modern with flat screen TV. Not much channels, music channel can work. A bit far from the main attractions like the Eiffel Tower, which makes it difficult to get to the attractions. The metro is packed with no luck to get on on Friday night. It was not one of the cheaper hotels in Paris and would have at least liked some coffee and tea in the rooms. The area in which the hotel is situated was a bit shakey for me, so if you're female and single I would not recommend the area, although Paris is quite safe. I did not feel at ease to walk by myself from the metro to the hotel. A safe-box would have been good to store valuables but we did not have any hassles.

The Eurostar arrives at Gare du Nord, where we bought our metro tickets and headed to the Gare de L'est. Hotel Soft is only about 5 minutes from both the Gare de L'est and the Jacques Bonsergent metro stations, from these you can go anywhere in Paris very easily. The hotel is in a side street off the Boulevard de Magenta and is nicely tucked away and quiet without being miles away from anywhere useful. When we arrived we were greeted very pleasantly, and the receptionist offered to look after our cases so we could go out for a while as our room was being prepared. When we got back we took our stuff up to the room and were very pleased with what we got! Nice comfortable clean bed, spacious shower, fresh towels etc. Very nice. The view from our room (104) was quite literally a brick wall, but this really doesn't matter when you have the whole of Paris outside your door. We went out fairly late each evening, and even when arriving back at half 1 we were greeted with a smile. The combination of the curtains that blacked out the room completely and how quiet the place was meant a good nights sleep too. Breakfast was very nice, pretty much what you expect..good coffee, juice, croissants, bread rolls, ham, cereal, yoghurt etc. A good example of how helpful the staff were: when you wake up and want to go for breakfast, just press 9 on the phone next to your bed and ask the receptionist if there is a table for (in our case) 2. If there is then it's yours, if not then go back to sleep and they will call you back when ones free! And we never had to wait more than 15 minutes. When we asked about anything in the city, whoever was at the reception would take out a map and tell us everything we need to know, and on our last day, even though our train wasn't until 7.15pm they looked after our bags for us right up until we needed them so we could make the most of our last day.

Some staff were great, some less so. My first room had some problems, the second was very good. The price is reasonable for Paris and for the quality of the room, but they nickel-and-dime you for breakfast, internet access and so on. The first room (007) was a good size and attractively decorated, but it had some significant problems. It was on the ground floor and the window faced into a courtyard that was the entry for tenants of the adjacent apartment building and where some small boys liked to kick a ball around. When you opened the windows, nothing separated you from the courtyard but an iron grille. It would actually be possible for someone to reach into the room. Not that anyone seemed interested in doing so, nor could anyone have reached in far enough to really do anything. But there was no privacy whatsoever - you could not dress, sleep, walk around naked or have a shag without shutting the windows and drawing the curtains every time (or leave them open and give the neighbours a show). Cleanliness was another problem. The bathroom had been cleaned, but there was a significant mildew problem in the shower, one that had been developing for at least a few months. There were a few sequins on the carpet that tipped me off that the room hadn't been vacuumed before I got there. A third issue is that the room was off a hallway that also lead into the cleaning staff's cupboards and the breakfast area. So in the mornings there was a certain amount of banging and clattering and noise from the TV. I was scheduled to stay from Thursday to Tuesday. On Friday night I asked at the desk about possibly switching rooms. A very nice staff person said they didn't have anything open until the Sunday night, but I could have a better room - actually my choice of rooms, since they had lots of openings - for the same price. Great! However, the story changed on Saturday when another staff person told me that she wasn't sure about the room switch anymore since they were booked up. By Saturday night the nice staff person was back on and I grumbled to him about getting the run around like this, and he promised me room 402. We also got into this odd discussion about how I originally got the crappiest room in the hotel because I booked through a online service, not the hotel's own website. That's not true, since I always book directly with hotels. I think Hotel Soft's website re-directs you to another service, in a behind-the-scenes sort of way. His printout of the booking looked quite a bit different from mine. So that's something to watch out for. I was annoyed that I had booked six months in advance and paid a 5-euro booking fee, only to get their worst room. However, room 402 was very nice - big, big bed, a bathtub. It faced onto the street so the view was typically Parisian (and so was the noise!). It seemed cleaner than room 007. I have no complaints about room 402. On the Sunday I tried giving Hotel Soft some customer feedback. This staff person (the same young woman who earlier told me that I may not be able to switch rooms) really couldn't care less. I told her that they should tell people who will get room 007 about the no-privacy thing when they book, since it is a pretty big deal. She told me that it is impossible to guarantee guests a specific room, they just assign rooms based on who arrives first, and \"that's how hotels work\". She also told me that this is just a part-time job for her and she is finishing a Phd, which I think was code for \"Hey this is just a money job for me so I don't care\". The morning I checked out, yet another staff person was on the desk. He seemed REALLY put out by having to deal with the transaction and I could tell he didn't like that I had been given a better room for two nights at no extra charge. I don't think he realized how close he came to getting nothing for those two nights, since I had already inquired at another hotel nearby. So, no, I wouldn't stay at Hotel Soft again - too unpredictable. However, I do recommend the area. It's not touristy, it's convenient for several metro lines and there are many restaurants and cafes.", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cAgree with favourable reviews of this hotel\u201d", "Author": "EJBuen", "ReviewID": "UR115358293", "Content": "Clean, comfortable rooms, very comfy beds, friendly and helpful staff, convenient location next to Gares, safe neighbourhood.

So the choice was open window with noise or closed window and sweat. This is a great pity because otherwise the hotel met all our needs. It is closest to Gare de L'Est railway and Metro (5 minutes walk), and there are useful bus services from the end of the street that get you lots of places easily (the Metro ticket works on the bus also). So getting around is easy. There are a number of bars and restaurants close by - on the same street are two we particularly enjoyed - Bistro des Faubourgs and Restaurant Le Bourgogne. Both authentic French and good English is spoken. Go for their 3 course menus at very reasonable fixed prices! The hotel has fast WiFi free of charge in all rooms: nice toiletries: comfortable clean rooms - but the rooms are small by international standards although typical of Paris. Breakfast was included in the room rate - a nice selection of cold items, cereals, cheeses, yogurts and fresh breads. Excellent coffee! The star of the show is the night front desk guy (Ahmed?) - charming, friendly and most helpful and speaks very good English.

After searching for some time and finding that to be quite true, we decided to increase our budget a bit to see if we could get something moderately acceptable. That plan did not work. Our room at the Hotel Soft was about as small as a room could be and still contain a bed. The place was not really 'dirty' but it definitely did not feel clean either. The obvious recent update to an old hotel mainly consisted of putting a decal on the wall and a modern vase on the desk. The bathroom had cracked tile, there was no place to put our two suitcases, and there was also no obvious technique for maneuvering past one another through the space. All this coupled with the unseasonably warm weather and no A/C led to a somewhat 'less-than-ideal' place to stay in Paris. My recommendation would be to suck it up and pay *even more* money for your stay in Paris, or suck it up and stay in some kind of hostel-type place, which will save you a lot of money and provide just about the same quality. The two benefits of the Hotel Soft are the great staff and the location.

We visited the Louvre, the Eifel Tower, the Science museum ... It was a two day trip and so we only needed the hotel as a place to sleep for one night and recuperate for the next full day of walking and visiting. I was very impressed by the friendliness of the staff and the very clean and modern look of the hotel. Those of you who already have been to Paris will certainly realise how exceptional this is for a moderately priced hotel ;-) (I only paid 110 euros for three persons for one night !) The rooms were rather small but ok for us as we only stayed for a short while. I had ordered a triple room , but the hotel had changed this to a single and a double room. Once they realised that I was taveling with my kids they rearranged the rooms so that they were next to each other. Very good service. The hotel is situated in the 10th arrondissement (which is in the north), very close to both the north and east railway station and therefore very good access to the metro network . It is also very easy to reach by car. Their website indicated that there was a parking nearby and that you would get a prefferential rate if you stay at the Soft Hotel. The parking was indeed close by and easy to find. However it seems to be exactly the opposite from the hotel : shabby and unfriendly. When you first arrive you have to give your car keys to the operator and he will park your car and keep the keys during your stay. In return you get a receipt with time and date of arrival. This means that, although your car is parked nearby the hotel, there is no easy way to get to any belongings that you leave in your car. At the hotel they put a stamp on your receipt and inform you that this serves a paymentn for the parking for 24 hours. So far so good. Things went bad however when I went to retreive my car. I had arrived Wednesday at approx. 11 AM and retrieved my car on Thursday 11 PM. They insisted that I had to pay for two days as my car stayed for 48 hrs (which is not true ! do the math). This would cost me 80 euros. I indicated the hotel stamp on the receipt and said that this was valid for 24 hrs. They said no, only for one day (? ! ) which meant that I still had to pay for Thursday or 75 euros (???). After some hassle (remember they are holding my car keys !), I could get the fee down to 70 euros, which iin my opinion is still a rip-off and nowhere near the prices indicated. I thought that someone would then get my car and bring it to me. But no, I had to search for my car myself (I had no idea where it was parked). Upon reaching the car I then noticed that my car wasn't even locked !!! This is NOT the kind of experience I want to have at 11PM, tired from visiting paris and having two young children with me. The hotel is nice and friendly but the car park is a total rip-off. I would strongely urge the owners of the hotel to have a very long talk with the owners of the car park. The experience I had with the car park is for me enough NOT to return to this hotel.", "Date": "August 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for Gare L'Est\u201d", "Author": "Evergreen05", "ReviewID": "UR36945117", "Content": "Chosen because of proximity to Gare L'Est and price.

This was my first time in Paris and my partner\u00b4s third. We are a young couple, 21 and 23, yet have traveled extensively worldwide and tend to prefer chic boutique hotels which are a bit more design conscious. Of course, at our age, that can often be impossible. I spent many hours searching for the perfect hotel because I have heard so many terrible things about Paris hotels. And I think for what I was looking for, this hotel had everything we were looking for. It was a weekend Thursday-Monday stay with a lot packed in and a busy schedule with friends in Paris and we simply couldn\u00b4t bear to encounter hotel problems. From the beginning, the hotel staff was extremely kind and helpful. They even made a us a reservation at a restaurant when we asked because our French is not so great. The lobby is not as nice as it is in the photos but in the end, the lobby is useless and serves no purpose after check in. We did not even purchase breakfast there which I think is a waste for 14 euros. There are great places around the corner. Anyways, past the lobby, the hotel itself is small and I love the way it is organized. The hallways are very narrow but long and well divided and everything is carpeted and dimly lit. It has more of an apartment feel or even fashion boarding house feel than a hotel. It\u00b4s exactly the ambience we like. We stayed in room 301 which was a cosy room. We had one of the pink rooms like on the website photos. I\u00b4m not sure how the other rooms look like, but I think they all come with flat screen tvs. I specifically emailed the hotel and asked for the room in the picture which I usually do to ensure the best. The room was quite large there was space for everything. Our room had a large window to the street which let in some light. During the summer I\u00b4m sure it\u00b4s wonderful as the window opens up entirely. Also the bathroom was great. Very very large and came with a bath. The sink, everything was very well decorated and it never really felt like a hotel. Everything was just so simple and understated and understandable. The carpet in the room was also very clean and comfortable. I read some other reviews which talked about thin walls. We didn\u00b4t hear anything but we also were only in the room at night and to sleep. Each floor only has 6 rooms. 3 on each side. So it makes it quite quiet I guess when people walk by. The lighting also was great in the room. The little complaints I have where the following. There were no drawers and not enough hangers. Silly things but I like to totally unpack my bags. There was a lot of floor space for everything but a little chest would have come in handy. Although the nightstands where great! And the toiletries were very minimal like in every hotel. But we always bring our own anyways so that wasn\u00b4t a problem. The location. The thing is we love to walk. And yes the hotel is not smack down in the center near the louvre. But you are 15-20 min walk to the marais which is a very nice walk, and metro is easy to get anywhere else because gare d\u00b4est is 2 minutes away. So if you\u00b4re worried about the location like I was, don\u00b4t be.

Excellent value, I would definitely stay there again if I return to Paris.", "Date": "October 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cPerfect stay in the loveliest area in Paris\u201d", "Author": "smeng78", "ReviewID": "UR20676153", "Content": "This is my second stay at Hotel Soft and as usual, it is lovely. The staff are extremely friendly and the rooms are lovely sized for Paris. The room decor and furnishings are nice and simple. This hotel is simply a bargain find in Paris and is certainly value for money. The breakfast is nice and filling. There's a bread basket, yoghurt, cornflakes, tea, coffee and juice. All good enough to start off your day. The area around Canal Saint Martin is really lovely and the road where the hotel is has plenty of nice looking restaurants to eat. Not to mention that the hotel is very close to Gare du Nord and Gare de L'est. If you're looking for a less than usual tourist experience and more Parisien, then this is the area to stay. I do think that given the rate of the rooms, the hotel is certainly deserving of full marks.", "Date": "October 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel, OK location\u201d", "Author": "je55", "ReviewID": "UR20527777", "Content": "Liked the Hotel Soft - the rooms are reccently renovated, clean and a good size.

Arriving back to the hotel after 10pm, the streets didn't feel that safe but saying that, the hotel is close to several metro stations so getting to central paris is quick and easy.", "Date": "October 1, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Soft", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d296861-Reviews-Hotel_Soft-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$125 - $225*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">52 bis rue des Vinaigriers</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75010</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "296861", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/3d/22/4f/hotel-soft.jpg"}}
