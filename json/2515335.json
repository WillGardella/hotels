Being a long time Marriott & Courtyard fan I found myself rather disappointed in this property. First I am always offended at having to pay a parking charge at a hotel, perhaps justifiable in some major cities but not $28 for Seattle. The heavy light blocking curtain, certainly needed, did jammed halfway across one of the windows and let in light all night. There was a strange annoying noise that repeated outside the window. No hotel or TV channel info was to be found. I normally would not eat dinner in a place like this but elected to for convenience. The \"dining room\" ambiance left a lot to be desired, food good, prices a bit steep considering the number of high quality eateries close by. On the plus side, great friendly service and they paid attention to my \"special requests\" which I always appreciate. The location is excellent if you are from out of town for a ballgame, concert or show in the SODO district as well as close to a host of great restaurants. You could walk back safely from many venues at night if you stick to the main roads to the hotel saving more parking fees. Overall I did not think this stood up to the Marriott standards and they have had a year to get it right. I might look at some of the other hotels in the area as well, unless you are a loyal brand customer in which case check out your room for quality before unpacking!", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and staff\u201d", "Author": "MapMinder", "ReviewID": "UR127250891", "Content": "We just stayed here this past weekend.

So this hotel is very convenient. We didn't have a bay view, but our view wasn't bad. The hotel was full of sports fans, but we didn't hear anything from our room, all was quiet. Could hear sirens, but otherwise quiet. The shower was nice & easy to use. No fan in the bathroom, but it wasn't a biggie. In the lobby they have a few computers to use, plus free coffee. They also had a pool, fitness room, and guest laundry facilities, though we didn't use any on this trip. Our free breakfast was in the 'The Bistro', cafe for the hotel and it was modern & clean.

I can't even begin to express my appreciation for the integrity shown by the staff here! Two small concerns: 1) valet usually takes a long time to retrieve the vehicle -- so call at least 15 minutes before departing your room. 2) location is perfect for the pioneer square.

The hotel is an easy walk to each of these, as well as some great neighborhood bars and restaurants. The remodel was tastefully done, and the addition to the rear of the building for newer rooms was also done appropriately for a historic building. The basement features a nice pool, but note that there is not a lot of lounge space around the pool so its best used for a workout rather than a \u201changout\u201d spot. The exercise room is huge and impressively equipped. I had a King room with the \u201cBay view\u201d which was on the tenth floor, putting me just high enough to see the water over the building across the street. The views are impressive and certainly worth an upgrade. While the room is not large it is intelligently designed with furniture whose flexibility allows you to make it what you need \u2013 a desk that can be pulled out and moved if you need a larger table, a small ottoman that works both as a table and seating space, etc. It was very well done. The bathroom was large enough to feel spacious without sacrificing square footage in the room itself. We had no problems with noise, even given that it was New Years Eve when we stayed. My only real complaints about the room were trivial \u2013 rather than properly strip the woodwork and repaint they saved money by just repainting on top of the old (which I suppose is better than ripping out the original features entirely!) There was also a long hair left on the side of our tub which grosses me out more than it probably should, but there you go. The hotel had friendly service, and is firmly in the 21st century with convenient electronic terminals set up for guests in the lobby to print boarding passes, valet service that takes a text message when you need to order your car, and free wi-fi that worked very well. I can\u2019t remember what we paid for valet, but given the dearth of available parking in downtown Seattle I found the fee worth the unlimited access to my car. We didn\u2019t try breakfast, but enjoyed a late night snack at the comfortable bar while watching the world go by out the floor-to-ceiling windows on the street.

This is a 15-story hotel, so it's not typical of a suburban Marriott Courtyard but it uses the urban model of a high rise, limited amenity hotel. The location is terrific. It's a block from Pioneer Square and a block from a light-rail stop that takes you to/from Sea-Tac Airport in 37 minutes for $2.75. The staff is terrific. I cannot recall a more engaged, friendlier staff at any Marriott property I've ever patronized. The rooms are pretty good. This hotel has been installed in a former office building called the Alaska Building and some of the old building shows through in the lobby where you can see mid-20th century marble and the old-style, multi-story mail chute dropping into a large brass mailbox in the lobby. You'll also see some of the old buildings in the windows, which use the old casings equipped with new double glazing. Our very large room had a terrific view of Seattle's sourthern downtown. Two flys in the ointment for us: 1. The room chair (an adjustable desk chair) was uncomfortable due to its design. This is the first such chair I've encountered at a Marriott Courtyard and I hope it's not the new \"official\" desk chair. 2. The credit-card room keys just didn't work well and we had a second set made (done cheerfully, of course). We had to try 3, 4, or six times before the door would open. We had similar problems with using the key in the elevator to access our floor from the lobby (a good security feature in any case). From this hotel, we walked to the ferry terminal for an inexpensive ride to Bainbridge Island (free return!), to the famous Pike Market to see fish tossed around by loud fishmongers, to the Underground Seattle tour (highly recommended), and to the light rail stop for a return to the airport. This area is well served by the Seattle mass transit system. The hotel has a restaurant and bar called The Bistro and we ate three meals there. Frankly, the food was good twice and mediocre once but the service was always spectacular. Note that this restaurant has a somewhat limited menu (hence the name), but you should be able to find something to dull your hunger. They serve Starbuck's coffee, in case you're an addict. Otherwise, there's a Seattle's Best coffee shop across the street. There was a ballroom located on our floor (14th) and we snuck in to take a peek. It was set up conference style and could accommodate about 50 people at tables set up in a chevron pattern.

Granted, the bathroom in this hotel isn't as nice as the other property but the hotel does feel almost (but not quite) as upscale. As another reviewer mentioned, this property seems more like a Renessaince than a Courtyard. The hotel is located in the Pioneer Square District which could be viewed as a strength (proximity to tours, market, etc) and a weakness (number of homeless in the area). As someone else noted, the windows in the rooms do not seem to be the type that reduce noise and we did have a lot of street noise even though we were on the 12th floor. This doesn't really bother us but if you are the type who needs quiet when you sleep, you should be aware of this issue. All in all, we thought this hotel was a good, solid choice.

My main reason for booking this hotel was its proximity to the football stadium. I was arriving in the afternoon for a 5:30pm game and wanted somewhere close so I wouldn't have to worry about getting to/from the game after a cross-continent flight that day. Rooms: A little on the small side, but nothing to complain about. There was limited closet space and very little space to walk around the room. There was a small sofa which was rather uncomfortable to sit on for any time. Good HDTV on a swivel so you could watch it from the bed or the sofa. My room was on the 7th floor overlooking 2nd Ave. It was quite noisy with sirens and buses outside. I'd recommend trying to find a room not facing that street. Overall, the room was a pretty standard Courtyard room (which is a good thing). One thing I found very unfortunate was the level of soundproofing between rooms. You could listen in on normal conversations in the rooms on either side. It made getting to sleep a bit difficult one evening through no fault of the people in the other room. Amenities: Excellent fast and free wi-fi. Free papers available each day. There was a small selection of snacks and beverages for sale by the reception desk. I did not have a chance to try any food or drink from the onsite bar/cafe. Location: This could be a strength or weakness depending on what you're planning to do in Seattle. For a football, soccer or baseball game, it's outstanding (10-15 minute walk to the stadiums). If you plan to use light rail/buses to get around Seattle, it's about a block and a half walk to the Pioneer Square transit station. If you're walking to Pike Place or that area, it's about a 10-15 minute walk. In the evenings, the area right around the hotel is pretty dead. I would have preferred a place with a bit more evening activity in the area (but made the conscious decision to stay here to make travel to the football game easier).

For $5 bucks, you get access to the Observation Deck---on the 73rd floor---which is higher than the Space Needle....and, MUCH cheaper. I had the entire deck to myself when I visited. Views are spectacular (as long as the weather cooperates). Tower is less than 5min from the Hotel.....much closer/cheaper/less crowded than Space Needle.

When I first checked in at 10 pm, the valet was friendly and it was welcoming. I didn't ask what floor my room was because I'm on a marriott associate rate and therefore not picky about anything. I had requested a king bed and high floor room, which is exactly what I got. I was on the 13th floor (there are only 15 floors) and it was a king. Perfect! I never expect too much due to the rates that I get at Marriott's but they treated me like any other regular rate customer. As for the room, it was really nice. The walk from the elevator to the room was very close. Everything looked brand new and no smelly hotel scent. The lights were dim but I was with my boyfriend and it was a nice atmosphere. I wasn't expecting a fridge but after some looking around, there was a mini fridge in the corner hidden next to the closet. I really like fridges because whenever I go out to eat, I always come back with leftovers and it works better when I dont have to use my portable cooler. The internet is also free! There's wifi (great reception even on the 13th floor) or you can plug it in like I did. Very convenient. The desk was nice to work on and the chair is a comfortable ergonomic one. Out of all the things about this hotel, I actually felt like my luggage and valuables were secure. I never feel secure usually. The HUGE difference between this and marriott waterfront was the safety issue. I had to store my bags and laptop after I checked out at courtyard. The front desk clerk made sure my laptop was safe in the safe deposit box (you get a key and the clerk gets a key, you need both keys to open that box) and she tagged all my bags not with a cheap sticky tag, but one with a string tag. She said that the storage area is video monitored and very safe. It was behind the counter in a room where I saw management staff walking around and that's what I really liked about it. The marriott waterfront's storage is actually right at the front entrance at the valet room and everyone walking into the hotel has a full view of all the bags. It was an awful feeling knowing that a stranger could easily go in and grab something. I wasn't even able to get a safe deposit box there and I felt bad using up the front desk clerks time because there were 7 other people behind me in line at the waterfront (understaffed obviously).....anyways enough about that, that's for another review. I didn't worry one bit about my bags at courtyard. To wrap it up, I loved it here. Valet wasn't an arm and a leg and you can't beat the associate rate at this hotel.

We were staying in Seattle for the March 25th weekend. Upon arrival at the hotel late Friday (Mar 25) evening the gentleman (an undeserved label) at the front desk checked us in quite promptly and had checked us into a room on the 11th or 12th floor. I asked him what we can do for parking (the website states $26 parking available) and he quickly told me \"There is no parking. You can park anywhere on the street from 6pm to 8am, after 8am it's pay parking.\" Being dismissed rather abruptly, I didn't question him. We took our baggage to the room which was very nice and very clean. The only problem was that it was a room with a bed and a small armchair. This indeed was not the king bed and sofa bed that I had reserved and seeing that we're three grown men, the single bed was not going to cut it. I went back to the front desk and informed him that the room was not as described. He quickly responded with a rude and short \"That's all we have!\" Refraining from speaking the foul language that I wanted to yell at this young man, I told him that there were three of us and I had reserved the room specifically to accommodate that. He rolled his eyes, took the keys back, and went into his secret computer of rooms. He then rudely asks, \"Did you guys mess up the room.\" Uhhh yes, we went into the room for 30 seconds, had an all out party fest in the room, and then came quickly down the stairs and asked for a new room. The nerve of this young man was uncalled for and he was lucky i didn't jump over the desk and strangle him. This is NOT the way you would like to be treated after driving for 2.5 hours on a friday night. The stay for the most part was good, the rooms were nice and clean. We did have another mishap with staff on the saturday. One of the hotel staff (concierge or door person) was walking down the hall past our room. We asked if there were any after hours places we could check out as it was getting quite late. He was short with us and quickly says \"No. You Asked an easy question, you get a quick answer.\" I couldn't believe how rude some of the staff were at this hotel. When we finally checked out on the friday, i took a look at the final invoice and what do you know. They charged me a $26 valet parking fee plus taxes for each night!!! This was laughable as I had to wake up each morning before 8am and move my vehicle because the Front desk guy told me there was no parking. I was fuming by this point. On a bright note, the lady who checked us out was very, very helpful. She took the parking charges off and helped us find our way to SAouthcenter which was our final destination on this trip. If we hadn't come across her, i probably would have given the service rating a one!

However, I didn\u2019t find the Courtyard concept to live up to it\u2019s \u2018business-friendly\u2019 marketing in reality. First, it\u2019s a historic building, so it\u2019s not like the roadside motels you would normally associate with Marriott Courtyards. The rooms were very small. So small, my bed was less than two feet from the window. A chair facing the North wall occupied most of the width. The wardrobe/desk combination was very awkward and not ergonomically friendly. I just worked from the bed using the WiFi. I honestly felt claustrophobic in the room, something I\u2019ve never felt before in a hotel room. I was disappointed, especially since I was entitled to a room upgrade as a Marriott rewards Gold member. The beds are comfortable, though not outstanding. The bathroom was very basic, no thrills, no additional amenities. In the elevator, the hotel had posters announcing that they now \u2018proudly served Starbucks coffee\u2019 in Courtyards. That\u2019s great, except this one didn\u2019t serve Starbucks, or SBC. It was the worst coffee I ever had. They have plenty of it downstairs for you, and some in your room too. It\u2019s embarrassing to advertise something you don\u2019t have, but by weird quirk of fate, is the closest Marriott in the world to the Starbucks global headquarters\u2026it shouldn\u2019t have made such a faux pas! In Seattle! Valet was troublesome. Friendly chaps, but when you arrive at night, sometimes they\u2019re inside chatting with the staff, not outside the hotel. I had to park illegally on 1st avenue for the night and go inside and ask for the valet. Also, you have to text for your car, which costs you the hotel user some change. Granted, if you\u2019re parking valet, you\u2019re in for a penny, in for a pound, but a phone call on the hotel\u2019s dime would be classier. The business center consisted of three all-in-one desktops with a proprietary Windows 7 interface. You can\u2019t access Win 7, just a browser and the three main office programs (Word, PowerPoint, Excel). It\u2019s awkward, and it times out at times. No tabs or multiple windows on your browser. I was in desperate need of a scanner and fax, with none to be found. Only a printer. It was a sub-par business center. Upon checkout, I told the desk that I wasn\u2019t satisfied, and she apologized, and said I should have been offered better service and accommodations based on my loyalty membership level, and said cheerfully, \u2018next time!\u2019 There won\u2019t be a next time for me, thank you.", "Date": "April 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cVery pleasant stay.\u201d", "Author": "andyhg", "ReviewID": "UR101969612", "Content": "We have stayed in Seattle many times and this was our first here as it's new.

Traffic, especially on I-5, is a 24 hour nightmare anywhere in the city. Why bother? Seattle has a perfectly good train which takes you from the airport right to the back door of this hotel! $2.50. 30 minutes. It will take you more than 30 minutes to drive from SeaTac to downtown almost any time of the day, and money to park IF you can find a spot to park at all. Why? The public transportation system is extraordinary, and FREE all through downtown. Just hop on a bus anywhere! Walk down the hills and take the bus back up them. Queen Anne, Capitol Hill, the waterfront, Bellevue, Georgetown? The bus, train, monorail or trolly will get you there faster than driving. Okay - the hotel. The Pioneer Square bus & rail station entrance is almost underneath the hotel. Walking from the airport train, with luggage, will take 2 minutes.

There is a coffee shop directly across the street from the front door and 5 or 10 more within 2 blocks. Caution: If you are staying a Friday or Saturday night, do NOT choose a room on an upper floor. The band & party noise from the 14th & 15th floors rolls down the outside walls as if all the windows were open. Stay BELOW the 10th floor. It's an old building. The lower floors have more traffic noise, but there is little traffic in that part of Seattle in the mornings on the weekends. Check your room after housekeeping leaves.

There is no garage so the valet parkers use a garage down the street. Including the Seattle parking tax, the cost is over $30 per day. Another thing to consider: It's a good 20 minute walk to the edge of the downtown area. While the Pioneer Square area is somewhat interesting, there aren't many good restaurants and \"street people\" can be annoying.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommended for a superior class hotel at reasonable rates\u201d", "Author": "mahiwahoo", "ReviewID": "UR81991288", "Content": "Tastefully furnished, although, the carpet is abit loud and busy on the eye!

New. Hip. Possibly Noisy. Neighborhood Sketchy for Female Traveler.\u201d", "Author": "Alice", "ReviewID": "UR79837409", "Content": "This is a brand new Courtyard and the condition of the hotel is excellent -- nice flat screen television with many channels, very comfortable beds with nice linens, very friendly, helpful staff, three computers and a printer in the lobby and the location is one block from the Pioneer Square Light Rail to Sea-Tac Airport. In general, this is a nice modern \"hip\" property. I think Courtyard is targeting a younger customer rather than baby boomers with the new design. I found some of the furniture not so comfortable for sitting. I did not care for the blue/brown themed retro decor or the individual pod check-in desks. Plus, the male employees wore \"Star Trek\" uniforms. One employee even jokingly asked me how I liked the Star Trek look. The Pioneer Square location is off the beaten path from shopping and restaurant areas but close to the stadiums. The hotel is located one block west of Pioneer Square Park on the \"good\" side. The area could be a little sketchy after dark especially for a female solo traveler. Just be alert. During the day the neighborhood was fine and populated with business office occupants. The Pioneer Square Park population consisted of drunks, homeless and some dubious looking characters but no one bothered me. The rail station was up a steep hill. The walk was a little workout with a suitcase in tow but doable. The main Pioneer Square station entrance had escalators going both ways. The James Street entrance had only one escalator ..... up to the street from the rail. My first room #804 was noisy due to its location in the historic front side of the hotel facing 2nd Avenue. Rm. #804 was a King room with a sofa bed and was on the small side with a coffee table and hassock in the middle of the room taking up space. This room was noisy due to general street traffic out front. I heard every car and truck drive by. I live in Manhattan on a busy corner. I experience urban noise everyday and found this room noisy. This Courtyard needs to sound proof the hotel windows on the front of the building. Rachel, at the front desk, offered a quieter room in the back of the building. I took up the offer. Since I was there only one night, I was upgraded to Studio Room #1020 in the back of the \"newer\" building. Much better, spacious and very quiet. Rooms above the eighth floor in the back of the building have an open view facing the office building area. I was very satisfied by the remedy and promptness of service by the front desk at 10PM. The Bistro restaurant had a nice crowd, decent food selection, especially for breakfast, and newspapers. At night, The Bistro was a practical feature because there was not much nearby. The fitness room was very nice and a good size with all new equipment. The property was very clean and tidy and the staff was enthusiastic. This Courtyard worked for my one night stopover and its convenience to the Sea-Tac Airport light rail station. For a longer stay, I would choose a property closer to the shopping and market area so I could walk around in the evening by myself and feel comfortable.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Smyrna, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cYes, it's really a Courtyard!\u201d", "Author": "GeorgiaTraveler4020", "ReviewID": "UR79805103", "Content": "What a pleasant surprise!
