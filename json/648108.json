As much as all Hotels put their 'best' imagery online and iron out any unsightly sections etc, I still wasn't prepared for how different this property looked in reality (to how it is portrayed on the website). It is sandwiched between a Best Western and some small shops down a side street, off a very busy road. It didnt look anything like the stylish imagery online. The whole property is very dark and the rooms, well as documented really - are beyond small. We booked one 'Club' and one 'Superior' room - and whereas the Superior was just about ok (if you didnt intend staying in it very much), the Club room was hideously claustrophobic. The walls have velvet sections on .. not so much for design as more so you do not bump yourself in the small space to get in and out of bed. The bathroom is so tight, I burnt my leg on the radiator every time I needed to use the loo!! When we were in our rooms, I had to open the room door, just to try and have some sense of space - not least because it was very dark inside and the small window overlooked a brick wall. We encountered a lot of noise from the flats next door (the one next to the Superior room ran water constantly .. what were they doing??!) and the flat beside my room had building work going on the whole weekend. I must also flag that there is a very sharp turn from outside the rooms to the top step of the flight of stairs - quite dangerous, especially for children. The Hotel does have a nice little tea-room, but when we were there it was full of non residents and we couldnt get a seat (it is a very small area). We weren't really given very much information about the facilities (such as we didnt even know the drinks in the Superior Room mini bar were complimentary!) and it was almost impossible to warm the Superior Room as we had the heating full on and it didnt seem to do anything! As much as anything, this Hotel is not on the Leftbank - please dont be under any impression that you are in the St Germain area of that side of the River . The property is actually in Montparnesse. It does have some interesting history regarding the artists whom used to live in and around the area - and a few cool art galleries and famous cafe-bars. The Montparnesse cemetry is about 5 mins from the Hotel, where Jean-Paul Satre and Simone de Beauvoir are buried (as are Samuel Beckett and Man Ray) and the Luxembourg Gardens and the Pantheon are close by to walk to. It will take about 25-30 mins to walk to the likes of the Notre Dame/ Leftbank 'proper' (downhill) and significantly longer returning .. as it is all uphill! This would have all been fine if we had actually prepared for being in that vicinity! For us, we were disappointed due to feeling somewhat misled as to where the property is and the 'estimated' walking distances to the sights. I have been to Paris a number of times but never stayed anywhere other than very Central - so to me, this Hotel was much further out than we were expecting - and that and the lack of light and any sense of space within the property, didn't make for a happy booking on this occasion. This all said, the Hotel is clean and the common areas are kept nicely. If you are fine with small rooms and noise from the neighbours (and the extra walking), I have no doubt this could be an acceptable base for a short stay.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lifton, England, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location, location!\u201d", "Author": "GillBray", "ReviewID": "UR121463632", "Content": "We spent 3 nights at the hotel and I still can't believe how easy it was to get there.

HOTEL/STAFF The managers were great, namely Alan and Patricia. The night shift woman helped us as well. She wasn't approachable but after a few questions she seemed to warm up and got us the information we needed. All 3 spoke English very well so that was great. The male night manager wasn't as aware of things as the day staff. He wasn't very easy to talk to. I think the night duty knows less about hotel stuff in general. ROOMS We stayed in room #54, man ray room for the first few nights. Room was small. The toilet was in one side of the room and shower/sink on other side,which was fine by me. It was a bit tight to move around with 2 of us, but we made do. We moved into a superior room, #52 for the next few nights since we extended our stay there instead of moving to another hotel in marais. This would have been convenient to shopping areas etc, but moving seemed more of a hassle and we liked Alan and the service the very first day. So we made that change the first day we got to academies. This room was facing the courtyard so not mug noise. One night there was some music coming from somewhere but that's it. The maid cleaning the room next door with the vacuum was what woke us up. Room 52 was larger than man ray and costs about 40 euros more. I think it's worth it if you stay more than a few days. We were in the hotel for a week. It seemed a bit larger than standard rooms in the USA. The room was facing the street and we were a bit worried, but it was pretty quiet since it was the 5th floor. Minor appearances could be worked on in both rooms: - grout in bathroom - scuff marks in tub - small carpet stains Overall, great staff, modern rooms, clean rooms.

We rented bikes from one of the stands that are all over the city for less than 2 euro an hour and it was 10 min to Notre Dame.

We stayed for 4 nights. After being treated to some honeymoon treats at the previous hotel in Bruge, we were slightly disappointed to not even be congratulated on our wedding when we arrived - let alone be offered a complimentary glass of wine etc. We had informed the hotel of the special reason we were staying in Paris on more than one ocassion, but they didn't even ackowledge it. So this was disappointing. If you go for your hoenymoon don't expect any little touches or gestures to make your stay extra special. Shame really as its quite a nice hotel. Most people will be staying here for a holiday I guess, rather than a honeymoon, so don't let that put you off. The hotel location is great - we had been to Paris before and stayed nearer the Eiffel Tower area, which was also great, but this time fancied a change. This hotel is right near the Luxumberg Gardens - they are beautiful to say the least. A MUST see. We didn't have the best weather unfortunately, but I imagine on a beautiful warm summers day you could take a lovely picnic here and soak in the atmosphere. Tube stops very close by to get you to anywhere in Paris on the Metro. The hotel is right in the hustle and bustle of the Saint Germaine area in Paris. There is no shortage of restaurants and fast food outlets, lots of bars and bistros around. Perfect for foodies. Personally I prefer to be little further away from the manic city atmosphere - but still able to access the busy areas if I like - if you prefer a more sedate holiday the Eiffel Tower area has much wider set streets and less traffic and people.This hotel really IS in the thick of it - but this might suit many people. Because it is in the busy area it can be quite noisy at night - we had a front facing room. There are no views as such - just looks out onto a Paris side street. It does get a bit nosey around 6am when the world comes alive again but the room does have aircon so you can close your windows if necessary. The room itself was lovely. Very clean which is always a major plus point for me when booking a hotel room. Adequet size for two people. We had a club room - any smaller and we might have been complaining there wasn't enough room. There is luckily a suitcase stand which helps leave floor space for manouvering. We had a bed, which was very comfy, side tables, mood lighting, two full length windows, a small dressing table with stool, and a full length mirror behind it, a little bistro style table with two chairs, and a teeny wardrobe. The wardrobe didn't impress much as it was so so small you could only fit about 5 things hung inside - and then the door wouldn't shut as the hangers provided were too wide for the wardrobe - very odd! Also the safe and the mini firdge were in one side of the wardrobe - which is fine - but the heat that the fridge created would melt anything inside the wardrobe - so don't store cosmetics in here! Probably a perk in the winter when you get your clothes out the wardrobe and they are all warm and toasty! The bathroom was SMALL! but fully functional. there is no door as such to the bathroom - rather a thick curtain that you pull across the room to separate the bathroom from the bedroom. So can be private if you wish. There is standing space for one person. A very shallow sink - quite difficult to wash in as so shallow you couldn't fill with much water. A mirror above the sink, and a bath/shower. This shower was fine - but nothing special. It worked and it was fairly powerful. Window in bathroom area a god send, as at least the steam from the shower can be ventilated outside. The toilet is in the bathroom but with a door to close - so in its own kind of cubicle. Breakfast was lovely - very french - but thats what you would expect in Paris! Can't remember the price but I think it was probably quite expensive for what you got - there are pastry shops just a hop skip and jump away to purchase your brekkie from - so don't feel you have to pay for breakfast. We did on this occassion as it was our honeymoon. It compramised of croissants (lovely!), breads, jams, butter, orange and grapefruit salad bowl, juice or tea or coffee and yogurt. Quite basic for the price. But very delicious. The area that you eat in is very dark! I know this is an art hotel as such but it felt a little clinical and try hard for my liking with its decor and dark ambience. Don't get me wrong - its a lovely hotel, but a bit dark and mysterious - perhaps a little pretentious. The herbal teas they do are beautiful tho - highly recommend a pot of herbal tea! Its not the friendliest hotel either - the greetings and checking out seemed quite clinical also - not many smiles from the receptionists or warmth - don't let this put you off though - your in Paris to see the sights not speak to the receptionist. Really great point it that they have a luggage storage cupboard where you can leave your stuff if you don't need to leave Paris too early. It seemed very secure as only the receptionist has a key. Also, a little tip - the toilets downstairs (below reception) are better than the room toilets - a bit more space and luxury. Overall an adequet hotel - I am not sure about all the rave reviews though - it IS lovely, but not THAT lovely. I would say pretty average as far as hotels go. Clean and modern though and very central to the buzz of Paris.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!

The hotel were gracious enough to leave some luggage behind while we went to Germany and then when we returned our luggage had been placed in our rooms. Very helpful.

I then read reviews on Tripadvisor and found out it was ranked 36 in Paris. When I went back to read about it again a few days just before my trip, its ranking had dropped to no. 54. I wondered why and it was not until my stay at the hotel did I find out it's drop in ranking. First, the good things: 1. Location. This hotel has a great location. Not that it is near the shopping malls like Galleries and Printemps, but it has many bakeries, cafes and restaurants just a few mins walk away. We ate at La Rotonde (excellent french food), La Pizzerata (great pizzas), Tavola Di Gio (fantastic Southern Italian fare), just to name a few. There are a couple of groceries to choose from and also a laundromat nearby. very convenient. There was no trouble getting to the hotel from the airport either. Take the RER and drop at Port Royal and the best part is, this station has an elevator. there is no need to lug your luggage up and down the stairs like the metro stations all around Paris. Then the walk to the hotel from Port Royal is about 10 mins. easy peasy. 2. Service. My husband and I are extremely satisfied with the service which the hotel provides. Henry, especially was exceptionally friendly. The staff spoke good English and everyone was most helpful. 3. Free Wifi. You get a printed slip for the code and password and wah-lah, you get free internet at the lobby and anytime you step into your room. The not-so-good things: 1. Small room. I stayed in the Classic room. I was prepared for a small room but the room was ridiculously small. So small that my husband and I each had to take turns to walk across the room. There was no space for us to open our luggage properly. There was a stand provided but if you use it, it blocks out the window and you can't open it. Perhaps the other rooms are bigger. Not sure. 2. Weird toilet. The toilets and the shower are not together. so which means you get out of the toilet, go over to the bathroom and wash your hands. The bathroom was small too and there was no bars or hooks to hang one's clothes. I had to use to little stool at the desk in the room to place my clothes. Also, there are 3 knobs in the shower. it took us a while to figure out how to get the shower going. Wished the hand held shower was placed much higher. The doors of the shower didn't keep the water in either. Hence, the floors were wet at times. 3. Soft pillows. I asked for firmer ones but they didn't have any. One of the reviews mentioned 'springy' pillows. it's true. it was a little hard to get a good night's sleep. 4. House-keeping. I did tell the hotel that house-keeping is a little slip-shot. For example, the empty tissue box was not replaced with a new one, new toilet rolls were not placed in the toilet when the last roll was used, bathroom floor was not thoroughly mopped and dirty plates were not cleared in the evening. there was no turn-down service but I guess I can't expect that from a small, boutique hotel.

Although small, it's a great place to stay. We choose this hotel based on reviews from other travelers, so we got pretty much what we expected. The staff is wonderful! They speak excellent English and didn't mind doing so. They pointed out local places of interest, provided maps and directions, and explained the Metro system. It should be noted that the front desk keeps your room key when you leave the hotel and that key is needed to active the lights in the room. The rooms are small. Boutique is apparently a French word that means microscopic. Thankfully, we were able to store our bags downstairs. The main complaint is the bathroom. We stayed on the top floor, rear of the hotel (I think there are only four rooms per floor) so it was quiet, but the bathroom overlooked a court-yard of sorts. The bath/shower is small with only a half partition, so water gets everywhere. The toilet is in a separate closet-sized room. Tip: if you make a reservation, ask for a room facing the street; it has a full-size shower. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in and took up about 75% of the room. The television was horrible and didn't work half the time. There's only two English stations (CNN and BBC News). Breakfast is an issue in France. It seems most Parisians think of breakfast as a croissant, a cup of extremely strong coffee, and a cigarette. The hotel had an elegant, over-priced continental breakfast. There isn't a pancake to be found in that part of Paris. We found a rather decent cafe about two blocks from the hotel with a full service restaurant across the street the serves something that passes for breakfast. There are tons of restaurants around the hotel for lunch and dinner. People eat late there. It wasn't unusual to see a packed restaurant at 10 pm with people still coming in. Waiters won't rush you to eat and you almost have to tackle them to get the check. A meal can easily take 2 or 3 hours. Smoking is only allowed on the patios, so be aware that eating outside usually means a heavy dose of nicotine. For those who enjoy public transit, the hotel is perfectly located. There are a few stations serving several of the more popular transit lines within a five minute walk from the front door.

We stayed in one of the largest rooms but this was still very small, however being from London I didn't mind this too much. There is plenty of storage space for all your things. The welcome was friendly but I feel the receptionist was a little overworked, she was very tired and as she was the only person there she couldn't leave the desk (not that we needed her too). We got a free map and she showed us where all the sights were which was very nice. Breakfast is continental only with no choice - 2 mini pastries, bread, 2 types of jam, butter, fresh orange juice, a yoghurt and freshly sliced oranges, plus a choice of tea/coffee/hot chocolate. This was more than enough food but it's always nice to have a bit of choice and I think my partner could have eaten a lot more! The price was a little steep too, however everything seemed to be closed given it was August so not sure where we would have gone for breakfast locally. The area is fine for getting to the sights, and well connected on the RER for Gare du Nord. I was disappointed with the lack of open shops etc. Nearly everything seemed to be closed due to Parisians being on holiday. It meant that it lacked atmosphere and just made it a bit of a let down as we were expecting lots of patisseries and things to be open! It's a Paris wide issue though so not much can be done about that.

I had booked it solely based on the overwhelmingly positive trip advisor reviews - the #2 hotel in Paris (!) and without doing any further research. After staying there I have to disagree with the high ranking and the high price. This is my 4th trip to Paris in 6 years and I have stayed at several hotels in several different districts in the past. First the location. Its located on a completely unremarkable little street about 6 blocks from a side entrance to luxembourg gardens (not the main entrance) - which puts it at a 30-40 minute walk from the main parts of the latin quarter (say rue mouffetard, boulevard saint michel or the pantheon). Other than the gardens, there is no other landmark or nice square or area worth visiting near this hotel. Second, the view from the hotel is the building opposite - which is most definitely not a charming building. And the street is not a charming street, or remarkable in any way. The hotel itself is completely ordinary. The entrance to the hotel is an ordinary door, like an apartment entrance, so you are taken aback right away. The \"lobby\" if you can even call it that is the size of a sitting room, with two small sofas and a desk where the receptionist sits. Its tiny, plain, and completely underwhelming. Third, the room. We booked a 16m sq room (one size up from the basic). I guess it must have been that big, but it did not feel like it. There was just enough room for one suitcase. I really can't imagine what the 13 m sq room is like. The furnishings were clean - a bit too brown and dark for my taste, but nothing to complain about. The view as I mentioned- was the plain building right across the narrow little charmless street. The bathroom was another issue, it was so tiny that one could not reach in to turn the water in the bathtub/shower on before you got in (Personally, I prefer to check that the water is not scalding hot or freezing cold before it comes down on my head :)). But the bathtub was deep and nice. Fourth, the art - which i only mention because it is mentioned many times on the hotel's website and seems to be a major selling point. There is a silhouette of a robot type of figure on the walls. And that's it. A white silhouette drawn on a wall in the lobby, in the elevator, and on one wall of the hotel room. There is no fitness room, or business facilities of any kind and the wifi was hopelessly slow. But the staff are friendly and seem quite helpful. Lastly, the hotel was so inconveniently located that we could not pop back in the middle of the day anyway for a rest. SO the good thing is that we got to be outside a lot! This is an unremarkable little hotel that should rank somewhere in the middle of the 2000 or so hotels ranked here. We paid $240 per night for a hotel that should not have been more than $100-120. There is a Best Western hotel next door that is comparable and was less than half the price we paid. On a side note, we had to come back for one night again after stopping in barcelona for 3 days - and we stayed at Hotel Des Grande Hommes - a view of the pantheon right outside the giant windows with flower boxes, a huge room, beautifully decorated, fantastic location - lower price!", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel - lives up to high expectations\u201d", "Author": "ResearchGirl", "ReviewID": "UR72551453", "Content": "After reading the highly favourable reviews about this hotel on TripAdvisor, our expectations were high.

We have been to Paris many times before, but chose this hotel because of its excellent reviews on Tripadvisor -and we absolutely loved it. Location: The hotel is located in the 6. arrondissement in a side street of Boulevard Montparnasse. It took us 25 min by metro (take the exit \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vavin\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, from here it is 2 min walking to the hotel) from Gare de L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Est to the hotel. If you like to walk, it takes about 15 min to the Ile de la cite and about 25-30 min to Marais. The metro line 12 brings you within 20 min to Montmartre. The location of the hotel is really nice; you can find several typical Paris cafes and restaurant around. Just opposite the hotel is the (old) Academie des Grand Chaumiere, so this is really a very special and historic site! Hotel & Room: On the website of the hotel you can see that they offer 3 room types (classic, club & superior) and 4 ambiences (parisienne, comedienne, Man Ray & Ruhlmann). Before we booked, we asked per email about the ambiences of the different room types, especially the classic, and where told that all classic rooms are in the Comedienne style. If you arrive before check-in time or want to leave late after check-out, you can store your luggage safely in the hotel. They also offer an opportunity for refreshment (sinks, soap, towels and toilets) in the basement of the hotel for guests before check-in and after check-out. The staff was very friendly and helpful at any time. We stayed in a classic double on a higher floor. The room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s size was as indicated on the website, small, but with an absolutely lovely and well-planned interior and an extraordinary styling. Everything was very clean. The room had two windows towards the street, one from the room and one from the bathroom. Bathroom (shower, sink) and toilet were separated from each other. The bathroom had no door (which we also knew from Tripadvisor reviews), but a curtain to close the bathroom area towards the room. The noise coming from the Boulevard Montparnasse was a bit loud at nights, so if you like to have the windows opened at night, maybe it is better to use earplugs.

She recommended and booked 2 excellent restaurants for us, as did the gentleman on our first night, who was also excellent. If you stay here, you MUST eat at the restaurant Wadje (just across the road - the guy who runs it is incredibly helpful and passionate about what he does. The second he told me he came from Bordeaux, I let him choose the wine to suit our food. He did NOT let us down, it was perfect (and it wasn't even near the most expensive wine.) The other great resto was Le Timbre - 10/10 for food quality. A little on the small side, but in fact that added to the experience for me . Anyway, I digress. The truth be told, i would have only given the rooms 4/5 as it was small and it was a club room. BUT the staff would have got 6 if there were 6 stars, so I evened it out and gave 5 for both.

After a hard debate on which hotel we would stay at while in Paris my bestfriend and I finally decided on Hotel des Academies et des Arts, specifically after finding this little gem on tripadvisor. We bought multiple tour guide books and researched the hotels listed in those and decided to abandon the books and roll the dice with this adorable boutique hotel (not listed in any books). Needless to say I am very happy with the choice and was pleasantly surprised. The hotel's d\u00c3\u00a9cor was very creative, considering the art district to which it's located. We stayed in the standard room and yes it was small, but you have to expect that in Paris. If two girls with two large suitcases packed for a 10 day trip can make this room work anybody can! The hotel is conveniently located to multiple metro stops, so getting to the major touristy spots are only moments away. The neighborhood was very safe and I was not at all worried about pickpocketing as in other major areas. There was an adorable cheese shop just a block away from the hotel and my friend and I packed cheeses, a baguette and other little treats for a picnic we had on our day trip to Versailles. At night the hotel staff leave homemade macaroons which were fabulous and added a great touch. After reading other's reviews on tripadvisor we made sure to ask the hotel staff to make us dinner reservations at Le Timbre (which was in both of our tourguide books) which is a mere few blocks from the hotel. The food was amazing and the atmosphere a lot of fun. The other night we stayed the hotel staff made reservations for us at another great spot near the Pantheon.

The receptionist was friendly and helpful, and the welcome ice tea and macaroons were greatly appreciated after a long day of travel. We booked the middle grade of rooms, so while I was not expecting a large room, I could not imagine what the size of the lowest grade of rooms was. Our first hotel room in Paris was small, but we kept the curtains open to allow the outside space to make our room feel larger. When opening our window in this hotel, we were greeted with a wall. Trying to stay positive, I thought that at least it would be quiet at night when sleeping with our windows open. That didn't happen since the people staying below us chose to use the courtyard as a smoking area. The smoking along with spotlight that was kept on to showcase the painting on the outside wall made up keep our windows closed and the curtains drawn. This only contributed to our room feeling cramped and dark. That being said, we peeked into the neighboring room while it was being cleaned. It was the EXACT opposite of our room. It was light, airy, large, and open. I would definitely choose to stay at this hotel, but would pay for the highest grade of rooms.

However, the hotel was exactly what I was looking for in a chi-chi boutique hotel for a mini break. It was very easy to get to from Gare du Nord - about 15 stops or so but they go by very quickly so didn't take long at all. We then were able to leave our bags at the hotel when we arrived, and they were super helpful, showing us the less touristy places to visit. Without prompting, they also confirmed our restaurant booking for the evening, had put our bags in our room when we got back and booked us a cab to take us to our evening meal. When we got back, they have a beautiful little bar to sit in, where you serve yourself from the \"honesty bar\" - great touch which made it feel as though it was a (very stylish) home from home. The room we had was perfect, very stylish decoration without being ridiculous. The bed was super comfy, the bathroom had a lovely shower and bath. They even arranged for my wife's makeup to be sent back to us when we discovered we'd left it behind when we got home.

We walked to many tourist places (Notre Dame, Louvre, Tower, Champs, Sorbonne, Pantheon, Hotel des Invalides, Concorde, Latin Quarter, etc) but there are multiple metro options nearby for those less fit. The staff were amazing, all of them. Helpful in every way, encouraging, offering suggestions and directions. Even helped me with my limited french. Now there's a point... most Parisiennes have good English, but appreciate the effort by visitors to respect their culture and language. We found the locals very friendly and helpful. Cool, chic, relaxed - this is a culture comfortable with itself, where the origins of modern democracy emerged from the streets. They gave the statue of liberty to the US, for goodness sake. The in-house breakfast is a treat. The decor is art-inspired, with small statues suspended in the 5 floor stairwell and paintings visible through the glassed lift. There are great local cafes & restaurants. Le Timbre is a local gourmet experience (but book first). Best gourmet restaurant was L'Rois de L'Isle. Every mouthful was like I was in the 'Babet's Feast' movie. As a base to visit further afield locations (Canal Saint-Martin, Disneyland, Versailles, Giverney, Le Peuse) it was terrific. If you are going to versailles, look for the Queens Hamlet (for a balanced insight). I would definitely stay there again. The room was comfortable and well appointed. Great shower and bath.

Have booked the same flight home the past 3 years and both Hotel sezz and Luxembourg parc's night staff were happy to organise breakfast for us before the other staff arrived.

When we arrived at the hotel everything exceeded our expectations. This is a small boutique hotel, to be sure, and it may not offer sprawling suites or a fancy restaurant on the premises. But we adored out elegant, cozy room overlooking the Paris rooftops; we fell in love with the funky art that greets you around the building at every turn; and could not have been more pleased with the staff and the service. Over the course of our five nights there we met three or four different persons at the front desk and each of them was friendly, helpful and very knowledgeable. I spoke with them always in french, but that was not a determining factor as I heard them deal with English speaking clients just as amiably and helpfully. And lastly, the location of this gem of a hotel in the middle of artsy and trendy Montparnasse, literally adjacent to some of the most traditionally renowned restaurants that Paris can offer (Le Dome and La Rotonde are but a couple of examples), and within walking distance of the Seine and the historical centre, is another great quality.

I found Hotel des Academies et des Arts on Trip Advisor, my first use of the website. The reviews on the hotel were incredibly positive, so the hotel had a lot to live up to. We were not disappointed. About anything, so it's hard to know where to start really! The hotel itself is charming, relaxed, quiet and boutique with a special touch of luxury. The location of the hotel is superb and the hotel is well connected (either on foot or public transport to the airport and the rest of Paris.) (From Paris CGD, take line B RER train to Port Royal station, the hotel is 10 minutes walk along Montparnasse.) Great place. Clean and stylish (ours had a drawing of a man on the wall) rooms. Not massive (I would certainly say standard size for a centrally located hotel in a European capital) but plenty of room for two on a city break. The lobby of the hotel is a delight of it's own (and reflects the nature and personality of the rest of the hotel.) Comfortable, boutique furniture, sumptuous decor, surrounded by international newspapers, books and artwork. We were fortunate with the weather in that it was sunny every day we were there (three nights) but the lobby would be a great place to spend a couple of hours in a downpour. I noticed that the proprietor also ran a tea house (from the premises) with some fantastic classic and exotic teas available, so one could happily spend some time with a tea and book or just talking with friends. We arrived hours ahead of check in, after taking a 06:00 flight from London. The room was made available almost immediately and we were able to check in. Had we not been able to, the staff would have safely stored our luggage and also recommended where to spend the following hours until our room was ready. I have heard (via Trip Advisor) good things about the breakfast, although didn't find time to stop in and take it myself. Other reviews comment on how tasty it is, so next time, I hope to try it. The staff all deserve particular recognition - they were friendly, attentive, charming and English speaking, with the patience for me to try out sentences in French on them before I ventured out. They happily recommended (real French) places to go and relax and eat and drink and also readily provided a wealth of information on sights and orientation. I can't commend them enough. Despite having been born and living my early years in Paris, I haven't visited much as an adult and was not sure what to expect in terms of Parisian friendliness to a Brit. How wonderfully surprised I was. Without exception, I found Parisians to be charming, polite and helpful. I followed seasoned phrasebook advice and always started a conversation with a smile and a greeting (and departing comment) in French - and I attempted to continue a brief conversation (badly - I don't speak more than a smattering of words) and it was either this that generated such positive, enjoyable interactions or maybe it's just Parisian nature! Great people. I loved Paris and can't wait to return. And when I do, it will be to Hotel des Academies et des Arts! You will not be disappointed. I wish the staff at the Hotel des Academies et des Arts all the best for a long and sucessful future and based on their current quality of offering, they will surely have one. I hope to see you again soon.

We liked staying in an area that was not overrun by tourists. The major Parisian sites are all accessible by metro or by foot. There are at least 3 metro stops servicing major lines within a short a distance of Hotel des Academies. There is no shortage of tasty brasseries and cafes in the area. We became quite fond of Cafe Vavin which was several short blocks away; a typical Parisian cafe, this was a fun place to go for cafe au lait and breakfast. We recommend having the hotel's breakfast at least once (15 euros) for the experience of it, but you can get similar 'petit dejeuner' at Cafe Vavin for half the price. If you are looking for antiques, this is not the place for you. As the hotel is only a year old, rooms are modern and very clean.

My wife and I stayed there for four nights in early July. Everything was as advertised, especially the friendliness of the staff. I had emailed the hotel that we would be arriving about noon and, although check-in is officially at 3 pm, they had made a special effort to have a room ready when we arrived. That was a real plus after hours on a plane. Henry, the day person at the desk, is especially nice and extremely helpful in all matters. I really recommend this hotel most strongly. And, by the way, when you ask for ice, they really give you ice! That is a real plus for me as it is for most Americans. This was our first trip to Paris, though we have both travelled through Europe extensively. I feel compelled to give new visitors to Paris a bit of a warning about the Underground as it generally receives unrestrained praise. Yes it works fine if you are knowledgeble about all the recent alterations. However, if you are not, be prepared for frustrations. For example, we wanted to take a riverboat cruise on the Seine and were told to take the number 6 (I think I am remembering the number correctly) in the direction of Charles de Gaulle Airport and were given directions to the Underground station. However, when we arrived, there were no signs indicating a that the #6 had a direction of Charles de Gaulle. All that was available was direction Nation and direction Etoile. Turns out the Etoile is Charles de Gaulle, but it took some research to find out. Similarly, we took a side trip which required we get a train at Gare de Lyon. We took a taxi there, but decided to take the Underground back as the map of the underground indicated that good old number 6 stopped at Gare de Lyon. We found the entrance to the Underground and need to head in direction Etoile (we had wised up at this point). But it seems that the platform for direction Etoile was closed for some reason, perhaps for repairs. Again, a frustrating difficulty for someone unfamiliar with the peccadilloes of the Underground. Other problems we found we that the maps of the Underground are not current, though station signs are. On a couple of occasion the maps showed the direction ending at a location but, evidently, the line had been extended so we could never find the direction shown on the map. Why they don't post easily readable lists of stations like the ones which are actually in every car is beyond me. In short, being familiar with the terrific maps of the Washington DC Metro, I sure wish the Paris Metropolitan would do the same. But, again, the hotel is great. You won't go wrong.

We stayed five nights and never got tired if it. The hotel is technically in St. Germain (6th Arrondisement) but is in the most southern portion of St. Germain and borders Montparnasse, therefore it's a bit more quiet (we didn't hear a peep at night and slept very well) while still being in a very convenient location, with easy access to the Metro and busses too. It's about a 20 minute walk to the Seine, through some beautiful blocks. The hotel was clean, modern, stylish, it felt very safe, and all of the staff we encountered were extremely pleasant. The bathrooms are nice and modern and while not huge, were certainly not simply closets. The bathrooms are well appointed with nice soaps and shampoos and even bath salts to use in the very clean bathtubs. The concierge recommended an excellent restaurant (La Timbre) and were always smiling and willing to help. We did not take advantage of the hotel breakfast since it's a bit pricey (15 Euro per person), especially considering that there are many good pastry shops and cafes within 1-3 blocks. Also the hotel is a mere 50 paces from a BNP Paribas bank, which is useful if you're a Bank of America customer since BNP Paribas partners with Bank of America such that Bank of America clients can use the BNP Paribas ATM to get cash completely free of any additional fees, very helpful to know. Overall this hotel was clean, stylish, relaxing, welcoming, and very comfortable.

The room was, as all reviews point out, not exactly huge - but exquisitly decorated, clean and the beds were large and very comfortable. The bathroom had a lovely big bath with powershower (great after being on our feet all day!) and were were lucky enough to have the first floor room with access to the small sitting area outside. Free internet access in the room and flat screen tv were a great addition, though, as usual on the continent, there were only two news channels - but then again, what the heck are you doing watching tv when the whole of Paris is on your doorstep to explore! The hotel is on a quiet street just off the busy Boulevard De Montparnesse with its plentiful eateries and cafes. Heading the opposite way from the boulevard and within 5 mins you're at the beautiful Luxembourg Gardens.

We had visited Paris once before and stayed in the 1er arrondissement and, although we enjoyed our first stay, this time we wanted to find a more authentic Parisien neighbourhood to experience a different Paris. Staying at the Hotel des Academies et des Arts we were not disappointed as this is a great hotel in a very appealing area - don't be put off by looking at a map of Paris and wondering if you may be too far off the beaten track as this is not the case at all. The Hotel is located a short and very pleasant 5 minute walk from the Jardin du Luxembourg which is a real hive of activity - recommend lunch in the little cafe there - and you can walk through the Jardin and find yourself near St Sulpice and Boulevard St Germain in no time at all. However, the local neighbourhood around Rue Vavin is very buzzy on a Saturday with lots of nice little shops and cafes plus the peaceful Musee Zadkine is just around the corner and you can happily while away a morning or afternoon in the area. There are also several Metro stops near to the hotel for taking trips further afield although you may find yourself, like us, longing to return to the local area when you find yourself emerging from a Metro stop into a typically busy and touristy area!! The Hotel itself is delightful - recently refurbished with a lot of thought and style yet small enough to be really friendly, offering first class personal service. The team on reception were able to recommend some excellent local restaurants, the three that we chose were all no more than a 5 minute walk from the Hotel and we had three superb meals. We decided to pay the extra 15 euros each for breakfast and this was probably one of the nicest hotel breakfast experiences we have had as there is no unseemly battling at a large buffet - instead the hotel staff deliver your own breakfast to your table and, given the current cost of eating out in Paris, we thought that we were getting good value for our 15 euros. Are there any downsides? Well, if your budget allows we would recommend booking into one of the largest rooms as space is at a premium here and our room was a little on the small side. Also try to get a front facing room which will be lighter than those at the back of the hotel.

We stayed here for 4 nights in March \u00e2\u20ac\u212208 and had a very enjoyable time. It does not surprise me that the hotel is 4th in the Tripadvisor popularity index. First \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Location. This lovely hotel is a 10 minute walk from Port Royal Metro and RER station. ( So easily accessible from both Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports). The RER trip from CDG takes about 40 minutes, one way fare is \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.20, an absolute bargain. The hotel is also served by three other Metro stations, Raspail, Notre Dame des Champs and Vavin. Vavin is only 50 metres away on Boulevard du Montparnasse, while the other two are less than 10 mins easy walk. Check in was dealt with very quickly and efficiently by the lovely Patricia. The hotel is situated right across the road from a well known art school and therefore it is only fitting that the hotel itself has a very arty theme. The theme is based on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhite Figures\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and you will understand exactly what I mean when you stay here. Very chic, very creative, we loved it. Our room was on the third floor (see my photos). It was compact but perfectly adequate and most comfortable. It was in three sections. Bedroom, bathroom (yes we had a bath, but I'm not sure if all rooms do) and a separate toilet. The room had 4 windows, the most I have ever seen in any hotel bedroom!! The view was of a tiny courtyard at the rear which has also been very creatively attended to with the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhite Figure\u00e2\u20ac\u2122theme. Our room was beautifully quiet and we enjoyed 4 blissful nights of undisturbed sleep despite being less than 50 metres from the very busy Boulevard du Montparnasse. The bed was one of the most comfortable we had ever slept in and on the last day we tried to find the manufacturers label on the mattress so that we might purchase a similar one for home (how sad is that?) Fresh towels every day and cosmetics etc are provided and the room was expertly cleaned and tidied. Flat screen TV which was nice to switch on for a while in the evening and a hair drier too. There is also a room safe. The lift is very efficient, but how could you not use the amazing spiral staircase with those white figures leading the way !! Free wi fi is available and there is an internet terminal in the elegant reception area. We waited every day to find the Parisien rudeness that many people mention, but we did not find it in Paris and we certainly did not find it at Hotel des Academies et des arts. Our hosts were the epitome of good service and assistance. They booked taxis and restaurants for us and saved us lots of time with excellent directions to metro and sights. I could not fault the service and this alone would bring me back to the hotel again and again. Breakfast is served in the hotel at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15, but while it looked excellent and we would have liked to have sampled it, there are so many places nearby to try out that we never did eat breakfast there.

The buildings are built hundreds of years ago and connecting walls of buildings are shared.

Henri was very well aware of the hotel's standing on TripAdvisor - they check it very regularly, and really cared about doing a good job and maintaining their popularity on TripAdvisor. Loved the decor of the hotel - beautifully artistic and charming. We had a club double room, and it was tiny (like every other Parisian hotel room) but very well-planned out. Henri told us this hotel even has slightly larger rooms than a normal Parisian hotel, which was pretty laughable, b/c the rooms really were quite small. On the other hand, you could tell a lot of thought went into planning these miniscule rooms, because everything was well-placed, stylish, nice details, quality stuff, etc. The key is to adjust expectations: Remember you're in Paris! Expect to stay in a closet and you'll be nicely surprised by this fabulous and tres chic hotel room. Expect to stay in an American-sized hotel room, and you'll be quite unhappy. 4.5 stars instead of 5 for a couple reasons: 1) The shower temperature was really temperamental & resulted in boiling/freezing/boiling/freezing showers, and we were told that other people had mentioned that to the front desk also. Henri said they had been working on the problem for a while, but were having trouble getting it fixed. 2) While we were sleeping, someone walked in on us without even knocking and left without apologizing - the front desk said it had been someone that was coming around to inspect the rooms. 3) Housekeeping was careless - we almost stepped on a razor that they knocked onto the bathroom floor, and they knocked over our travel-size bottle of conditioner onto the heater next to the shower.

Where we stayed was a standard double room and we had a couple of suitcases with us (since we were from other side of the world). What happened on us is that we were not allowed to find enough room to settle the suitcases due to its smallness.

The hotel is also very near St Germain de Pres and that area is worth a visit as is Le Marais - both cool, hip and great areas to walk through and have some food!

We used Trip Advisor recommendation to decide for the hotel and therefore I feel compelled to give our experience. So it was my mother's 60th Birthday and my sister and I did lots of research on hotell finally deciding on the Hotel des Academies et des Arts 1) because of location 2) because of so much positive review regarding decor and service. I have stayed at numerous others in St. Germain including the K+K Cayre (which is great) and at first sight, the HDAEDA was a good choice. Decoration is fantastic and staff friendly. However, this shiny exterior soon faded. The rooms are incredibly small - cool decor, well laid out - but minute. I had to leave the bathroom to dry myself after a shower ! We had three rooms in the family, my sis, my mother and myself. all rooms exactly the same except in ours they had squeezed a bath in, making the bathroom even wincier. for this we were charged an extra 35\u00e2\u201a\u00ac per night because it was deemed a 'superior' room - what a joke. We complained especially as the receptionist agreed that no superior rooms were available (my sis wanted one) and expected them all to be the same price. They were one on top of each other .... since then we have been waiting and debating for a week this extra unreasonable cost. Still not resolved, now waiting for a week. In total we stayed 3 nights - over 1800\u00e2\u201a\u00ac spent. not by any means a cheap option. My mother was ill on the Saturday so she needed room service. Some kind of hot drink. The hotel info said \"up until 11pm\" service was available. At 9pm, nothing was possible. Nothing. Not even hot water. We had to go to a local restaurant to get a drink for my ill mother. Not good. Secondly, regarding service - we came back on the Saturday, to no towels in our room. Not even flannels. So we rang down and asked for them. Someone came up and asked to come in the rooms to check there were no towels. I told him there were none and he asked me, \"am I sure ?\". I also have disbelief at the service but I wouldn't dream of 'accusing my customers of stealing towels'. Same thing happened to us the third night and to my sister and husband. The excuse given when we left was all of the staff are new, nothing by way of apology. Thirdly, breakfast was very average. Nothing special compared with the K+K buffet which had champagne and a big fruit selection. HDAEDA's was served as there is no space for a buffet. My final gripe was that the TV system was rubbish. Nice flat panel TV, but the menus were very slow, very poor selection of TV channels and for almost everything, you had to pay extra. In summary, I don't want to be unfair. We enjoyed our stay enough, staff were friendly and decor was cool. However, service was lame and the value - per sq metre of hotel you get (i.e. cost and room size) was extremely low in our view. I just don't think this is the best hotel in Paris and I find it hard to believe all of the previous reviewers had none of the issues we experienced. p.s. the candid photos shown must have been Suites I think, not very representative.
