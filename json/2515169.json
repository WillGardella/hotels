We have just returned from a four day trip to Paris and I was very pleased with this hotel. The staff were incredibly polite and helpful throughout our stay; it's nice to see a Paris hotel that really 'gets' customer service. We arrived in Paris early in the morning and they allowed us to store our bags at the hotel even though check-in wasn't until 2 p.m. Likewise, on our final day they let us keep the bags at the hotel until our evening train which enabled us to make the most of our last day. The room itself was small but we were hardly there so that didn't matter. Both the room and bathroom were immaculate and were cleaned each day. There was a decent power shower and soft white towels which were replaced daily. Although the hotel was fully booked you wouldn't know it as the room was so peaceful. We slept with the window open but the only sound you could hear was the bells of a nearby church. The location is also fantastic. There are three metro stations within a stone's throw (Temple, Republique and Arts et Metiers) and many more within 5-10 minutes' walk. However, we walked nearly everywhere as everything was so accessible. All in all, we had no complaints and I would readily recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Paris.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CAMBRIDGE", "Title": "\u201cWONDERFUL STAFF!!!\u201d", "Author": "ZANA88", "ReviewID": "UR126218161", "Content": "We have just returned from a 4 day trip to Paris and stayed in this wonderful hotel with the friendliest and most helpful staff you could ever wish to meet.

It was cleaned daily, the towels were changed and the shower was powerful with plenty of hot water. The breakfast was great and there was plenty of choice - it was buffet style, you could eat as much as you like and it was all freshly prepared (no stale croissants or hard bread). We ate twice in the restaurant across the road called the \"Cafe Bar Le Temple.\" It's eclectic decor consists of leopard skin and movie star photographs (and we even spotted some lacy knickers and handcuffs) but the food is WONDERFUL. We also tried the \"10\" restaurant (situated at the Crowne Plaza hotel) which although beautifully decorated in a contemporary style did not (in our opinion) have the quality of food of other Parisian restaurants that we tried. The staff were very friendly and efficient but the food was a major letdown.

The service was great, easy check-in and check-out. Always there to offer advice. They even let us borrow a wine opener for an evening! Definitely bring a wine opener with you whilst traveling. WIFI was good. We didn't get breakfast because there's so many lovely cafes everywhere. The location was awesome as well, the best part was that it wasn't 'touristy' at all.. No flaming tourists bouncin around if ya know what I mean. It was in short walking distance to plenty of delicious restaurants and cafes. A grocery store around the corner and plenty of great shops (clothing, shoes, etc). Also very close to metro stations which was key. Nearby was the St. Martin canal which was beautiful at night!

Since the metro system in Paris is very good, you can go from the hotel to almost anywhere in the town in less than 15 minutes (unless you are going to venues like Versailles). Moreover, Marais is an amazing neighborhood, very beautiful and lively - yet, Rue du Turbigo is not noisy. Staff is very helpful. For instance: one day, we had a medical problem, and they kindly offered to call a doctor, since we didn't speak French very well - and we were certainly nervous. There is a nice balcony, which allows a superb view to the neighborhood. Some minor problems: the elevator is very small, it will probably not have enough place for you and your luggage; the bathroom door is strangely transparent; the maid may wake you up early morning even if you ask her not to - it happened once.

You could hear people using their bathrooms from other rooms or floors but this is common with all hotel rooms and I recently experienced the same in a hilton hotel.

As hotels in Paris are very overpriced I found it again very difficult to find something that felt like good value. Le Relais du Marais offered a good value offer through expedia. On arrival, and probably as I was travelling alone, I was put into a small room without direct daylight. The window was facing a lightwell and other room windows so I had to keep my blinds closed. The other light into the room came only through the glass door to the bathroom, which luckily was not an issue staying by myself. I decided to ask for another room as I didnt feel for the price this was where I would want to stay even for four nights. I believe that even at \u00a3100 a night you can still expect something more than that. The hotel staff was a bit hesitant in offering me a different room so I had to wait until the morning. The change in room was better, now facing the front of the hotel and with plenty of light, but space was something to be desired as well as very dated decor. Anyway, I decided to stay put for now. There was also seriously bad sound insulation between rooms, I could hear people coming back late at night and talking in the room next door. Not great. Also, the breakfast was very, very minimal in a super small breakfast area offering only a small choice of pastries and packaged cheeses and yoghurts. Eggs were only available every other day. All in all, I would not come back. If you do decide and book it, just dont expect much. It is okay but simply just okay. I still believe that at that rate, more can be expected.

The guys running it are very warm and friendly and they have a good sense of humour! We walked to Notre Dame from the hotel, it took just over 20 minutes, we also walked back to the hotel from the Louvre, which is no big deal. The areas you're walking in all feel safe, however there are a few beggars but they don't get into your face. Plenty of reasonably priced food places nearby. The rooms at this hotel are cosy, but quite big enough. towels were changed daily, the room was cleaned daily. If I want to find criticism, of course I can find it, the maid missed dusting the reading lights over the bed - big deal! The bedroom carpet had some stains on it, which is a shame, because I think that otherwise it was in good condition, but that was because a previous guest was dirty, but it's a shame the hotel doesn't do something about this - perhaps they tried? In the bathroom I noticed a little mould on the silicone, a little bleach would definately get rid of that. That was my winge. Would I stay here again, definately, would I recommend this hotel, without doubt! The staff here are really friendly and helpful, they have a baggage room and checkout isn't until 12.00.

The staff at the hotel were all extremely helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them. The hotel itself is quirky (in a good way) and very comfortable. The rooms are small but as a sleeping base and somewhere to get ready for a night out, it is more than adequate. The room/bathroom were always very clean and the room also had a mini fridge which is something not all large chain hotels provide so that was a bonus for us. The rooms were air conditioned and had a flat screen tv (no english speaking channels but was fun to see what we could understand). The only potential issue I could find (if I was picky) is that the bathroom has a frosted glass door which doesn't give you much privacy but luckily my partner and I have been together for a long time and so weren't too worried about this! Breakfast was included in my stay and was really convenient as it meant we could go back to the room and get ready for the day out after our breakfast. There isn't a huge amount of choice but plenty of fresh food available such as croissants, yoghurts and boiled eggs. Tips for things to do/places to go during your stay would be as follows: OpenTour open top bus trip - around \u00a329 for the full day, 50 stops along 4 routes in Paris and you can get on and off as many times as you like. Louvre - absolutely amazing experience, don't let the sight of the queues put you off as the staff are incredibly efficient. Make sure you brave the crowds to get a glimpse of the Mona Lisa. Eagle - a fantastic gay bar on Rue St Denis (around 10 mins from hotel). Staff and other clientele were extremely friendly and welcoming. Not to mention the super strength, great value cocktails (around \u00a35). Chez Omar - amazing couscous restaurant around 5 mins from hotel. They don't take reservations and you will have to wait for a table but it is well worth the wait! The Royal couscous was around \u00a324 and you would not need a starter or a dessert if you go for this option! Cafe de Temple - an excellent Corsican restaurant across the road from the hotel. The decoration of the restaurant is somewhat 'different' and looks like a shrine to Marilyn Monroe. If you don't let this put you off then you will have an amazing meal. My tip is the beef fillet with shallots. Overall I would definitely choose this hotel again. One final tip - don't bother to arrange an airport transfer. We paid \u00a360 for a shuttle transfer (one other couple) from and to the airport and it really wasn't worth it. The transport connections are so convenient that you can easily catch a train to Gare du Nord station and then the Metro to Temple (even if you have a big suitcase).", "Date": "May 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cIdeal centrally located 2 star hotel for a short stay, business or pleasure.\u201d", "Author": "sva777", "ReviewID": "UR108273048", "Content": "Small, well run hotel, which was quiet and central, near Republique and short distance from Gare du Nord and the main tourist sites as well.

It's just 200m from the Place de Republic, only 3 metro stops from the Gare du Nord (Eurostar). The rooms are above average for a 2* Paris hotel, small but nicely furnished, with fairly new bathrooms and bright furnishings. Our room (42) had a double bed, small wardrobe, TV, and small but spotless bathroom with a double-sized shower with door, (not just a curtain). The rooms were very clean, serviced every day, lovely fluffy towels replaced each day. A double french window opens to a view over the busy street below. Traffic noise is high during the day as you would expect from Paris but quiet at night and anyway the windows are double-glazed so it's not a problem. The reception staff speak English and there's a lift to save your weary legs. Breakfast was a bit steep at 10 euros, but there are plenty of cafes etc on your doorstep offering continental fare at 8 euros or less. Try the Croissanterie across the road for pastries juice and coffee at about 6 euros each. Our only complaint was that there is no safe in the room and it's 4 euros per day to rent a box at reception - haggle with the reception staff for a cheaper rate! Location - Temple metro station (line 3) is almost outside, or walk 200m to Republic station for 4 lines taking you all over Paris. We walked to Notre Dame and the river via the Pompidou Centre in just over 20 minutes, and Bastille is just as close. The Marais quarter is on the doorstep with all its cafes and boutique shops. Eating Out - There are plenty of bars and restaurants in Place de Republique, catering mainly for the American and Japanese tourists who stay at the Crowne Plaza. Our only bad food experience was at Pizza Pino - 12euros for a salad consisting of one tomato a few slices of mozzarella and a few olives, and indifferent service. OUR TIP - catch line 3 from Temple to Bourse and try the many restaurants in the 'Passages' leading towards the Grands Boulevards (but get there by 7pm to get a good table). Getting Around - The OpenTour on the double decker bus is great on a nice day, but not much fun when it's cold as everyone huddles on the lower deck and you can't see anything..and very slow during the rush hour. The Metro is easy and cheap - unless you're a museum addict (try the Paris Visite card) the best way is to buy a Carnet of 10 tickets from the automated machines at each station (cash or cards accepted). Our favourite sights - The Eiffel Tower from the Trocadero Metro (it's the view on the postcards), Bercy Village (amazingly peaceful gardens and converted wine warehouses with restaurants and shops), the Paris Mosquee by the Jardin du Plantes (try the restaurant for tagines to die for and wonderful mint tea) We had a great stay at the Relais du Marais and would recommend it if you're looking for a reasonably-priced, clean, no frills, well-located hotel in Paris.", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBest value hotel I've stayed in in Paris\u201d", "Author": "pauncefoot", "ReviewID": "UR97868050", "Content": "My daughter and I stayed at the Relais Du Marais during half term to celebrate her birthday.

There is a hairdryer in the showerroom which only works when the fan is switched on, and unfortunately only one accessible plug in the room.

It is pleasantly and artisically designed although a little OTT and would benefit from being Feng Shui'd (hanging lanterns over the bed) XD. Overall it is reasonably quiet although you can hear a distant and regular rumble of the metro. There is a small window in the bathroom with no view, and a small window to the side of the fire escape (no view) - lending itself to a slightly claustrophobic feel, but adequate overall. Pleasantly furnished and modern overall with good shower (although it wouldn't stay fixed when showering so you have to hold it - good power though and modern). A tiny lift will take your luggage up and they have a storage room for luggage on checkout day which is useful. I parked in a nearby road in a garage at 25 euros per day.

It can be quite noisy with the window open so I'd suggest a room on the upper floors. The lift is tiny, but very quaint! The biggest pull of this hotel is the staff, who were all very warm, welcoming, and charmingly friendly. We attempted our meagre French when speaking to them, and they all reverted to fluent English straight away when they noted we were struggling. They are certainly the biggest assets to the hotel. Location-wise, the walk into town is not as far as it appears on the map. A leisurely stroll gets you to the George Pompidou centre in no time, and before you know it, you've arrived at Notre Dame!!

There is also a Mont Mart around the back of the hotel to pick up groceries and toiletries if needed. I stayed in a twin room on the third floor in a very contempory room, the room was clean and tidy and sufficient for 2 people, also having control over your heating was a nice feature. There are a few downsides only minor such as the bathroom door is a frosted glass panel decorated with marbles which is quite funky but when travelling with a friend, you can see them on the loo but you can just look away as there is a flat screen telly to watch with a couple of english speaking channels, you can also hear the toilet flush in other rooms and taps running but you dont hear people talking but im sure this is the case in many hotels.

No, not an English breakfast, something much better. Healthy, energy food and lots of it! If you are looking for a clean and friendly good-value 2/3 star hotel in central Paris, look no further.

It has an elevator (small by US standards but large by Parisian standards--easily fits two adults and baggage) which is really important if you end up on the 5th floor as we did. Like all Paris hotel rooms, it was much smaller than a US standard, but ours was quite charming--nicely decorated bathroom, a small writing table, a closet wardrobe and french-door windows with a low wrought iron fence around a small ledge. Our reservations included the price of breakfast (not always so, you may want to check the price first otherwise), and the breakfast had a very nice variety of items--croissants, pain au chocolat, mini-baguettes, butter, soft cheese, yogurt, cereal, milk, coffee, hot water for tea, hot milk for hot chocolate, and various confits (jellies and jams) and the omnipresent but must-have nutella (try it on the croissants). I actually found their breakfast better than the breakfast menu--which means a set breakfast usually of coffee, juice, croissant or pain au chocolat and/or buttered baguettes offered at a set price--found at the nearby cafes. The entire staff was friendly and polite--from the front desk managers to the cleaning crews--it gave the hotel a very nice relaxed atmosphere. The managers spoke English fairly well and they were very helpful with directions and questions. The hotel itself if a half-block (if that) from the Temple Metro station and a mini half-block further to the Republique Metro station (a larger station which services more than one line). The hotel is on a side street (quieter) but very close to the Place de la Republique, around which there are cafes, boulangeries (bakeries) a bank (for those ATM withdrawals), bistros, a Monoprix (like a small upscale Target which came in very handy), and boutiques of the expensive and dirt-cheap varieties. There is even a MacDonald's (if you really must) further along the Republique circle. The nearby metro stations were great for getting to places like Notre Dame, Il de la Cite, Eiffel Tower, etc. Marais itself is often hopping, but we ended up spending a Saturday and a Sunday there, so most of the shops on the streets radiating off of the circle were closed then--but nearly all of the shops, cafes, restaurants, bistros, etc. on the circle itself was open. We've heard of accounts of people having much worse accommodations for about the same price we did.

As with many other travellers, i was somewhat apprehensive in choosing a hotel from so many but the hotel was ideal for our price range and length of stay, thanks to the help of Trip Advisor. Having visited Paris several times previously, staying either within the Montparnasse or St Germain districts, i thought a change would be best. The hotel was easy to find, the metro stations of Republique and Temple very close by, and the room was adequate, not big by any means but clean, tidy with an ensuite that included a bath. Breakfast was typically French with cereal, croissants, coffee, tea etc and was ideal. The hotel staff were great, their English very good and more than helpful. As for the area itself, there are plenty of cafes, bars and shops at the main Repubique Square as well as along the rue du Turbigot. Easy to find and suit all tastes but would recommend the Temple cafe opposite the hotel as well as a small and typically French restaurant one block away whose name escapes me, think it was Le Sommeilles, but was recommended to me by the hotel staff. Absolutely great food and not too bad price wise (90 euros for 3 courses + wine). As for getting around the city, we jumped on the metro (best to ask for a 'carnet' - 10 metro tickets - cost 10 euros) and bought ticket for open top bus. This allows you to get around the city stopping off at most of the main attractions. You can get the red bus at Musee D'Orsay, Notre Dame, Opera and Eiffel Tower to name some of the stops. It cost 22 euros and you get the use of the bus for 2 days. In summary, a good hotel to use as a base, in a good area and would recommend.
