I thought they were nice, large sunny rooms - always meticulously cleaned, with comfortable beds (fluffy bedtoppers). Kitchen area was very nice. The hotel is very well located - Palm Parkway is literally 1-2 minutes from the DIsney entrance, and just off the main highway (which made it easy for us Northerners to find our way to other attractions, as well), but is a serene little oasis lined with palms, with several small strip malls with restaurants and shops. The Winn Dixie is 5 minutes away - we made sandwiches to take to Disney every day. We didn't have time to use the pool or other hotel facilities, but they looked fine. The laundry room was clean and had newer machines. Having the suite made it possible for my husband and me to stay up while our little guy zonked out. I was especially impressed by the friendliness of the staff, including the cleaning staff - a little thing, but their greetings were very genuine and made us feel welcome. The breakfast is a little \"industrial\" - egg patties rather than real scrambled eggs, etc - but the staff kept everything well-stocked.

We booked our family holiday last minute. The Quality Suites location was central to the main Disney parks and attractions. The rooms were clean but a bit out dated. But still was comfortable after a long day at the parks. The breakfast was good, but the only downside was that as soon as it hit 9:15 the staff started to clear the breakfast items. I think breakfast times should be extended to 10:30am instead of 09:30am. It is not that they had to cater for lunch or dinner. My reason for this is that most people would return to the hotel after midnight after watching the disney parades. By the time the kids are in bed it is easily 1:30am. Therefore having to get up again early just to catch breakfast is not fare. The staff at reception and house keeping, esspecially Patricia were amazing. She is a very nice lady.

Breakfast was OK with cereals, waffle maker, yogurt, sausage, some circular egg product, small muffins, etc. The area where the food was located was too small and not laid out well for the amount of people. It was like playing bumper cars with people to try and get to the food. The room as I said was roomy. The sitting area and bed area appeared to have been freshened up fairly recently. The bath area (part of the bedroom area) had not been updated recently and was kind of bland and basic. There was a fridge, stove top, and microwave in the room. The sitting bar doubled as an eating area and your desk as there was not a seperate table for a desk to work on computers. The furniture was basic and no frills but was usable. As I said, this was a value type place versus one trying to make a luxury impression. Would I stay here again? Maybe. It would depend upon the price versus the competition. I would not refuse to stay here as it was very good for the price paid. I did like the lower amount of traffic on Palm Parkway versus the Vineland Drive hotels on the other side of I-4.

Quality Suites is very close to many immenities. It is a 2 minute walk to a plaza that has many stores and a large variety of restaurants. it is also very close to outlet malls and every kind of shopping you could possibly want. Staff were friendly, courteous and helpful. we had a fantastic stay here. It suited our needs and our budget. We spent most of our time at Disney, but the Quality Suites was a welcome and relaxing place to come back too after a long day of fun in the Parks.

First of all, the location is excellent (you'll need a car, though): minutes to downtown Disney, 15 minutes to the Disney Parks, 10 minutes to Sea World, 15 minutes to Universal! No need to take the I4, just follow Palm Parkway and Turkey Lake Rd to SW&Uni. There's also a - busy - Wallmart closeby for your groceries. Also compiments for the staff: they are VERY FRIENDLY! Even at the information desk they're very eager to help and will give you discount and/or priority voucher for nearby restaurants (Planet Hollywood etc.). I stayed in a 2Q suites (1K rooms were sold out), which of course was quite comfortable for just me. If you try to squeeze 4 or more people in this room, it will be very tight! Hotel was quiet, breakfast ok and not too crowded. As I traveled alone, I felt pretty safe in and around the hotel and in the area! There are a few cons: 1) airco (still) makes A LOT of noise .. you'll have to turn it off at night and leave the ceilingfan on, but it may get a bit sticky in your room. 2) No in-room safe to store laptop etc. 3) Found 1 cockroach in my room halfway during my stay - killed it - but I still felt a bit squeamish after that. I asume - because I stayed on the 4th floor - it came through the kitchensink-drain, which I plugged after the encounter. 4) This one is more serious: there was a fire-alarm one morning. It was so loud and noisy that you had to leave your room (that's a GOOD thing, you couldn't ignore it). So I left my room, using the stairs to get outside and found many people (some in pyama's and holding small children) waiting there. We waited a while, but NO ONE came out to tell us if it was for real or just a false alarm. Eventually I went inside to ask and the receptionist - who was very busy trying to solve the issue but seemed to be alone - finally told me that it was okay to enter the building again. Seconds later the firedept arrived and I think they checked the cause of the alarm. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN SUCH A SITUATION TO KEEP THE GUESTS INFORMED and they failed a bit on that account. All in all, if the price was right I would stay here again (or at the Extended Stay next door, but their 'free breakfast' is not even basic).

Very nice location and very convenient to stores, restaurants and Disney World. 5 min ride to Disney. Shuttle leaves once or twice in the morning to Disney and returns at night but we opted to drive so we could return on our own schedule. Kitchenette very convenient for family.

GREAT outdoor pool. Relatively clean rooms. Separate bedroom and TV room. They are a \"Disney-friendly\" hotel which means Disney allows them to sell park tickets in the lobby - here's the catch - You have to sit through a one-on-one time share presentation. They claim it's 90 minutes but ended up being about 2 1/2 for us. We saved about $400 on tickets. After the woman gave us the comparison costs, that's when she hit us with the time share requirement. We went for it. We had built 2 extra days into our vacation so we had some extra time. We picked a morning we knew the weather would be bad and raining. They shuttled us over to the time share complex 10 minutes away (very nice) and we met with the sales guy. Typically like-able sales guy until he realized we weren't going to buy. Then he tried to turn the wife on me with a guilt trip. Kinda crappy but I don't care. Wife was on my side and we saved $400+ vs the online prices posted at the Disney site. If you don't typically give in to pressure easily and have extra time, go for it. I learned a lot about how time shares operate. Otherwise, get your tickets somewhere else.
