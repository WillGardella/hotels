It has small but workable rooms. The rooms are pretty secure and hotel is always buzzing with activity. The staff is pretty helpful and will always help you in how to get to any new place or arranging a taxi etc. Hotel's wifi is pretty fast too. Hotel ibis is located near Alesia Metro Station. Alesia is well connected to all major locations of paris especially shopping and other main attractions of Paris. The breakfast served at the hotel give a variety of assorted breads, cheese, meat, coffee etc. All in all- a good hotel.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Trieste", "Title": "\u201cNot so good and too expensive\u201d", "Author": "YouBeeTs", "ReviewID": "UR123050245", "Content": "Small hotel, with no common space (the hall is almost nonexisting). My room was ok (the standard Ibis room) and was clean but needed refurbishing, as many areas in the hotel, where the plaster on the walls peels off. The quality and variety of the breakfast is below the Ibis average. Nevertheless, it is more expensive than the average: 100 euros per night. Ibis Alesia, which is about 500 meters away, is more spacious, better kept, closer to the subway, serves a better breakfast, and is cheaper. On the plus side: friendly staff, free wifi in the rooms (but quite slow).", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malta", "Title": "\u201cPleasant surprise\u201d", "Author": "NevilleCalleja", "ReviewID": "UR121704291", "Content": "This hotel was a pleasant surprise. The rooms were very comfortable - the staff quite courteous. In addition, make sure to have the breakfast, the selection of cheeses, pastries etc is much more than you'd typically expect of an Ibis elsewhere.

The hotel has free internet at the lobby and the breakfast at 7:50 euros is satisfying enough But what I like most about this hotel is the efficiency and helpfullnes of the reception staff particularly those assigned in the evening of Nov. 5. Some friend brought us food and there was no place in our rooms to eat them since there were 6 of us in our group. I asked the reception staff id we could eat in the breakfast room and pay whatever charge we have to pay... they did not pnly allow us to use the tables in the breakfast room for free they also offered the plates and utensils . When we offered to clean them since they are not charging us for their use they told us to just leave them on the table and they will be cleaned in the morning. It does not end there..the following day We had to check out at 7:00 and when we went down for breakfast before the scheduled breakfast time .. the guy at the reception was preparing the buffet...we asked him if we could just stay at the breakfast room for coffee while we await the start of scheduled breakfast time and he did not only agreed, he brought out the food to accommodate us ... I have been in 5 different hotels in Paris before but never experienced this kind of treatment.. thank you very muchi .. ..IF I go back to paris again I will surely stay at Ibis Paris Maine Montparnasse again...", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cOne of the worst IBIS hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Doris168", "ReviewID": "UR67293856", "Content": "The bathroom has mouldy walls and stained shower curtain.
