We stayed at this hotel during the last 1 1/2 weeks of 2008. We had booked a standard room but was pleasantly surprised when they upgraded us to a suite. But that positive aspect wore off quickly. Pros: Close to MTR station, free water bottles (2) and quiet area of Causeway Bay, for the most part the staff was friendly and accomodatingCons: Unclean rooms, smoke smell for a non-smoking room, lack of free internet in room, weird room layout, a hair dryer with a button that had to be constantly pressed on for it to stay onThe restaurant is nice looking but for the price it was not really a place I'd go back to.

Our first night we noticed a rather bad musty smell however we were so tired from a half day travel, we put up with it for the night and escaped for a day of shopping quite early the next day. After returning, the smell was quite incredible and so we asked to be moved. A couple of room changes later (we were moved to a smoking room and then a twin single bed room) we were accommodated on the 37th floor in a room that was reasonably clean but most importantly did not smell.This is definately not a 4 star hotel, but rather a good 3.5 star Hotel. It is conveniently located next to a MTR Station and the staff are pleasant and accommodating. It would be more realistic though to pitch this Hotel for what it is, and that is a good solid budget option to the 4 and 5 Star Hotel chains we all know such as Sheraton, Conrad, Marriott, etc.This place is very cheap (around 1,000HKD per night) by HK standards, and if you can put up with EXTREMELY hard beds and a little bit of rough around the edges then it is a very good hotel for you. For a new Hotel it was a little bit knocked around and the room we ultimately ended up in was a adjoining room which was noisy when the other guests were present.

So happen that it is raining when I reached the hotel on my first day. The hotel staff had to run to me with an umbrella. Fortunately for me, no rain for the rest of my stay. The check-in is fast and the staffs are friendly. There also 2 PC for free internet access at the lobby. Didn't try their breakfast but finding food to eat in HK is never a problem.

It\u9225\u6a9a a so-called harbor view hotel with no harbor view except you\u9225\u6a99e assigned to 36th floor or above. Regular room size is acceptable for a typical hotel in Hong Kong, but smaller than expected as what we\u9225\u6a9de seen on their office website. Towels are somewhat dirty. Toilet seats are stained for the two rooms I served with my family, as photos showed by other traveler from this web. Bed size is good but bed sheets are not replaced daily for long stay clients. Hardwood floor instead of carpet in room would be a good design of avoiding smelly after years. However, it\u9225\u6a9a a bit noisy since there\u9225\u6a9a no carpet to absorb the noise. Residence from next door closing the closet door or banging the washroom sliding door produced noise in late evening. The sliding door is light and loose so everyone slams it on closing. Walls in room are stained unevenly, and doesn\u9225\u6a9b like a new hotel at all. Hallway is hot but elevator is cold. Some residence smokes on non-smoking floors, and sometimes even the elevator is full of smoking smell. Pool and exercise room closed very early. Sauna that mentioned on their website becomes invisible. I can\u9225\u6a9b find it in exchange room on 39th floor or no sign for it at all. Where is it? Staffs were very inattentive. The hotel is not facing the main street. Staffs at door were not insisting of getting transport vehicle like taxi to visitors, especially on rainy day. Worst of all, there\u9225\u6a9a no first aid in this hotel. I hurt my leg in hotel due to their sudden construction on hallway. There\u9225\u6a9a no notice or precaution advice to residences. They were neither providing first aid support to me nor compensate on my medication, but only with a discount on consumption of their restaurant. But they mentioned online that they\u9225\u6a9de \u9225\u6e04octor service on request\u9225? One of the three elevators has been out-of-service for more than a week. It\u9225\u6a9a extremely poor on management.I tried their buffet lunch once, not too bad except pricy. Like other travelers experience, only one fast food restaurant on the same side of the road and McDonald\u9225\u6a9a across the street with a few other restaurants. There are not many choices in walking distance. You\u9225\u6a9de to take a ride to Causeway Bay to get better dining and more varieties.

I checked online when we were there (late May 2007) and standard rooms at this time of year were available for \u9227?20, given the location and quality of the hotel this is excellent value. Located just over the road from the Tin Hau metro system it is a modern glass and steel block. On checking in we were offered an executive harbour view room for an extra \u9227?0 per night. This we took and were rewarded with a 37th floor room with magnificent views over the harbour.The room was a reasonable size for Hong Kong. There was a good size double bed. The mattress was on the firm side for our liking but it was comfortable enough. By the window there was a glass topped occasional table and two chairs. Here we spent many hours watching the activity in the harbour as the occasional eagle flew past our window. Along one wall was the ubiquitous combined working surface, dressing table and baggage storage area. Under this were ample drawers and an (empty) fridge which we found very useful. In the hallway was a wardrobe with a good size hotel safe. Curiously there were slippers in here but not any bath robes. Previously stolen perhaps? The bathroom was well equipped with a good quality shower set inside a smallish tub. The raised basin sat in front of a large, well lit, mirror, there was a smaller magnified one to the side. There was a wide range of toiletries and accessories.Room aside, we did not use much of the hotel\u9225\u6a9a facilities. There was a buffet restaurant on the first floor. The front of house staff all spoke English. Reception was efficient and the concierge staff helpful. Throughout our whole stay only two of the three elevators were working. This sometimes led to waits of five minutes or so for one to arrive. Linen in the rooms was changed daily and the standard of cleanliness throughout was high.I would place this hotel in the upper three/lower four star category. Not super deluxe but still a very clean and comfortable place to stay. It is very good value by Hong Kong standards.

Frankly speaking L`H has no harbour view at all, we lived on 21st floor facing Victoria harbour, but the view was completely blocked by nearby buildings, we had only a 5sm glimpse of harbour through local condominimums.

But... from this wonderful forum we know for sure that THERE IS SAUNA, and finally they gave up and pointed to its location. Housekeeping explained to us that to have sauna always ready is very expensive so if we need it they`ll prepare it in half an hour.

Our party includes my husband, me, and our 6 and 4 year olds. We were a bit concerned about the room size at first due to our previous stay at Emperor Hotel in Happy Valley. Our first pleasant surprise was how spacious the room was especially relative to hotel room size in Hong Kong. 4 of us shared 2 twin beds, with plenty of floor space and desk space for kids' activities and snacks and even visitors. (At Emperor Hotel, we had a King size bedroom and we had to use the window ledge as extra space. The room was not even big enough for 4 of us to walk without bumping into each other.) The bathroom was fairly spacious as well. We were able to give baths to our kids comfortably. We were also able to stow 4 pieces of luggage out of sight. We were also very pleased as to how clean the room and the hotel is. Growing up in HK, I am aware of the potential cleanliness and mold situation. None of that was a problem at the hotel. The decoration is not fancy but very clean cut and modern. Our 4 years old had a minor accident at the hotel due to our fault. The hotel staff was very attentive and offered to take us to the doctors' office ... etc. It ended up to be very minor so we didn't need to seek medical attention. The front desk and housekeeping staff is always very friendly during our stay here. My husband used the gym here. Though it is small, it is a big plus. There is also a swimming pool. It is quite attractive but it is only open during the summer time. There is one restaurant in the hotel offering buffet for lunch and dinner. The spread was quite impressive. Since I was with my family and the local friends most of the time, there were just too many other dining options for us to try the buffet. The location was wonderful. It is actually not right IN Causeway Bay but between Causeway Bay and North Point. Though the description of the hotel is a bit misleading, it is still in a great location. I actually prefer this to Causeway Bay as it is one notch more quiet than Causeway Bay and it still has all the convenience: right across from Tin Hau metro, tram and bus stops, taxis accessible within a few seconds, right next to convenient stores and walking distance to Electric Road with great local eateries. It is a very safe area. Even our family and friends were quite impressed with the hotel. Since it is quite new, it is still not widely known. We definitely will return to this place again. Because our stay is 15 days, we privately negotiated a rate with the hotel. We actually paid more 2 years ago at Emperor Hotel. We think the comfort, room size, convenience and value is far superior at L'Hotel. This is a relatively new hotel. Hopefully when we return, the place will have only improved for the better.Highly recommended for all types of travellers including families with kids.

My kids and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. The hotel itself is lovely. As I was travelling with my kids (ages 15, 11  7) on my own I wanted to have them in an interconnecting room or at least in a room on the same floor as they said they could'nt accommodate all of us in one room. We did book 2 months ahead but they still told us they would not guarantee either. On check in the hotel said that none were available and the best they could do was put us in a king suite which meant that my 2 girls and I shared the king size bed and my son slept on the sofa. This was annoying but at least they were with me. The suite was very spacious and did have lovely views. As the hotel is relatively new, it felt to me like the staff were learning on the job. It seemed that lots of small things added up and ended up being extremely annoying. One that springs to mind is that when I travel I don't like my room serviced, but even though I put the Do Not Disturb sign on my door, I would find my room cleaned and made up everyday, even after asking the staff not to! As stated in other reviews, english at reception is a problem, although they are nice but it was very difficult to get the information I wanted and in the end I gave up and worked it out myself. Another problem was that I had booked this hotel based on the lovely pool seen in the pics as its hot and I thought that it would give my kids something to do, after a day shopping, well the pool is there and looks very inviting but its padlocked as the council has yet to give it approval. The location is nice and not as busy at Kowloon, which is what I was looking for but I think next time, we'll stay around Admiralty as that is on the main line and doesnt require a change of trains, having said that it only takes a few minutes on the train anyway.
