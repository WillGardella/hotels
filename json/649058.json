This expensive Hotel promotes wi-fi, but is that slow that it's like don't have it, most of the time it doesn't even work. I had problems even with the heating that wasn't working. When after some days they fixed the heating, they didn't want to turn it on because outside was 50 degrees (to me it's cold and there was a terrible wind that was entering from the windows that don't close very well). If you ask for clean towels they tell you that in the contract they are supposed to give them to you no more than once per week. If you have problems with something they don't help you. The lights of my room, used to work some day yes some day not. I saw 3 times cockroaches and they didn't want to send somebody to do something, but the just gave me a spray. The elevator is terribly slow and once stuck at the second floor for about 3 minutes (I was so scared!), but luckily it started again. Useless say that when I told them, they didn't even pay attention. Last thing, but not less important, after the first month sleeping there, me and my husband started having strong back pain (the mattress is horrible!). The ONLY positive thing is that is pretty close to the subway and that is not really dirty.

When we first arrived check in was quick and easy and only took a few minutes. we were given a room on the 6th floor which was basic but was perfect for us as we weren't planning on spending much time in it anyway! We were apprehensive about sharing a bathroom with other people as this was the first time we have ever done this. But to be honest it was no problem at all as the bathroom was always free and was right next to our room. So i wouldn't advise paying the extra for your own bathroom. The lift in the hotel was quite slow but thats just a minor rather picky observation. The hotel staff were also very friendly and helpful, we asked for advice a couple times about where to get off the subway and stuff, and they always went out of their way to explain everything to us. Also their was always someone on the reception 24 hours a day. Also they were quick to respond when we asked for clean towels, they were brought up really quickly. There was also internet available in the lounge area,you paid 1 Dollar and got 10 minutes which i thought was reasonable. The hotel was also in an ideal location for jumping on and off the subway as it was a two minute walk to the station.

Let me put things in important perspective: the hotel cost less than half the price per night than at the Lincoln Center area YMCA. Let me repeat: half the price of a YMCA. I saw a photo of a room on the hotel's website which i thought way too nice to be a real photo. When i visited the hotel and looked at rooms i found rooms exactly like the photo. The one i occupied was luvly, newly renovated with a great king bed HD tv, small refrigerator and microwave, not huge but completely adequate, clean, comfortable and quiet. The hotel is situated on a quiet upper west side brownstone street, a two minute walk to the express Broadway subway line at 94th Street and one minute walk to Riverside Park. Great location. The management and support people starting with Evan, the manager, were all courteous, helpful and nice. I did not have one unpleasant exchange during three months of occupancy. Once a week the room was thoroughly cleaned and linens and towels replaced. There are shortcomings: there is one small elevator. It works but it certainly at times requires patience. The hotel wifi is very slow and i purchased mobile connectivity during my stay. And the lobby and hallways are not up to those of a high price hotel. But all in all i think it is an amazing value for the money. There is absolutely nothing on the upper west side of Manhattan as nice for the money by a country mile. It fit the bill perfectly for my needs and I heartily recommend it for anyone on a budget on a longer term stay.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood value compromise\u201d", "Author": "SGeerdron", "ReviewID": "UR119986659", "Content": "We picked this hotel to try to stay as central as possible while not paying through the nose or staying in an absolute hole.

I am pretty happy with the hotel's location, service level and room quality. The location's splendid: the 96th street subway access is just 2 mins' walk away, and you can take the express 2 & 3 trains to Times Square in 15 mins. There are plenty of amenities within 2-5 mins' walk - pharmacies, convenience stores, supermarkets, cafes (including Starbucks), laudromarts, and restaurants. The room I have is of decent quality. I love the modern furniture they use and the bathroom is as per the pictures you see on their website - very clean and modern. The bed's comfort is decent and the study desk and table are of good quality. There's LCD TV and wireless access in the room too. The only complaint I have though, is that there is no heater in the room. I've asked the front desk twice and apparently there have been plenty of complaints. Although New York is looking warmer this week, my room was cold as it faces the back (which is quieter than those street facing ones). So I had to get a portable heater from Bed, Bath & Beyond for $60, after having sleepless nights from the cold. Other than the aircon issue the service quality is pretty good. Brittany reserved the room for me couple of weeks prior to my arrival and was responsive to my emails when I was overseas. I was checked in efficiently and the front desk is helpful. My parcels were duly received and I was informed too. I would highly recommend Hotel Alexander to my anyone as long as they are not too particular about the upkeep of the common areas, but appreciates the room's quality and the hotel's accessibility.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgreat value for money and fit for purpose\u201d", "Author": "Kat6919", "ReviewID": "UR115368497", "Content": "this hotel was perfect for what we needed it for, basically a place to sleep after long days sightseeing and meals out.

When I asked for this on check out the front desk clerk ( a young lady) told me that I needed to contact the manager after the fact by email or phone. I did this by email on a number of occasions the following weeks but NEVER repeat NEVER received a response! I was paying an average daily rate of $102.00 plus tax.

After flying/travelling for over 30 hours from Australia we finally made it to the hotel after 11pm and all my friend and I wanted to do was shower and get into our own beds and sleep! When we checked in we were told that the room we had booked 6 months ago (2 single beds with private bath) was not available and they tried to butter us up saying they were giving us a better room which had a renovated bathroom but only one double bed! The guy at the counter was nice and we were too tired to argue but we agreed that if we didn't like the room then we could swap to the room that we had originally booked. So we had a terrible nights sleep as my friend and I had to share a bed which was very uncomfortable so the next morning we complained and after a few discussion with the reception staff we were moved to the room we originally booked. Apart from that initial hiccup, we found Hotel Alexander to be great for what we wanted. Its 2 blocks from the subway which was great for us as we used the subway everyday. The room was cleaned daily and we were provided with fresh towels and soap. On the downside, the rooms dont have irons or ironing boards, kettles/tea/coffee, fridge, safe, mini bar or anything else you would expect in a hotel. This was annoying for us because we were staying there for 2 weeks and couldnt even buy food and keep it in the fridge or lock away our valuables. My advice would be not to leave anything valuable in the room such as passports ect and lock everything in your suitcase daily. Having said that, they do have a safe behind the reception counter (I wouldnt trust that) and offer free tea/coffe in the lounge area and cheap internet which was $1 for 10 minutes. All in all you do get what you pay for! This is a budget, no frills hotel. It is not the Hilton! You will not get room service or anything fancy. You will get a clean, well maintained room close to the subway.

On the day we attended our friend's wedding (Oct 27th) the hot water supply failed and was not fixed all afternoon and when we called reception, I felt that we were 'bothering' them when they were already aware of the problem. It wasn't the end of the world, but it did lead to us feeling fairly uncomfortable at having not been able to freshen up fully for our friends' big day. We didn't even really get anything by way of an apology. Having said that, the rest of the time the staff were incredibly helpful. Also, the hotel was pretty cheap in comparison to anything else I was able to find in NYC.", "Date": "January 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "ohio", "Title": "\u201cCompletely misrepresented on the website\u201d", "Author": "blubelle147", "ReviewID": "UR51226008", "Content": "The hotel was NOTHING like it appeared to be on the website.

Our room was a superior with queen bed which was extremely tight to say the least. You do expect smaller rooms in NYC but this felt especially small. The queen bed was a good size and comfortable and the bathroom was modern and finished well but the room was just not big enough for the bed and then all our things. I actually ended up stacking all my clothes on the window ledge which also acted to block the draft from the windows. On that we asked about the heating due to it feeling pretty cold most of the time. We were told that the heating was on but it worked only in short bursts and to wait for the gift of heat with bated breath. I did get a bad feeling when the reception staff then offered me blankets if it was still too cold. When the heating didn't come on after 2 days we gave up until one night about 2 am it burst into life sounding like a helicopter landing in our room. We quickly turned it off to avoid the pending explosion. Our biggest problem came on the Saturday night which was the night before me and my wife were getting up at 5.30am to run the NYC marathon. There appeared to be a party going on just down our corridor which involved lots of drunk loud people shouting and slamming doors! Annoying at the best of times but with 26 miles of torture ahead we were particularly annoyed to be lying awake at 1am. We complained several times and to be fair the solo night staff member did try and shut them up but it still took several hours for it all to eventually die down. We had planned to kick up a fuss the next day but the marathon drained us of all ability to communicate. With all the negativity dealt with the hotel is in a lovely part of the city with the subway and lots of shops restaurants etc only a few blocks away. The key west diner on broadway is particularly good for breakfast as we found out almost every day. The hotel was also kept particularly clean with a team of staff buzzin around every morning. Most of the staff at reception also appeared to want to help with any problems and were for the most part friendly. As alot of other reviews have mentioned you do get what you pay for and when you compare the price to other hotels you definitely save alot by staying here. If you are on a budget I would definitely recommend this hotel as long as you are not expecting luxury. For all the time you are in your room on a trip to NYC it does feel like throwing alot of money at a hotel is a waste but this is down to personal preference. Overall you might be lucky with one of the bigger rooms and no parties keeping you up all night.

The staff at the front desk knew this but quickly told us that a city inspector had to come out to inspect the rooms the next day and thought they would have our room available for us the next evening. The staff put us up in a non-renovated room with one double bed and one single bed with a shared bathroom. The bed didn't have a matress pad on it and you could see the matress through the sheets and the comforter was torn. The room was very depressing and gross and the bed was in front of the room door so it was easy to run into the bed on entering the room. The bathroom was clean at night before we went to bed but was nasty in the morning. We had to get ready for a wedding in this shared bath. The next morning we asked the staff about our room and were told that we would not get it that night either. We were continually \"put off\" by the staff. When asked about the city inspector there was a look of question/confusion on the staff member's face. We are pretty sure by this point they were lying to us.

Unfortunately the cleaning staff are not consistent. I left the 'please clean room' sign on the door and upon return, I found they took the towels, emptied the bins and made the bed but did not provide new towels or a roll of toilet paper. There is just one lift and it is used by everyone, including cleaning staff so sometimes you have to wait ages for a lift, particularly during the day. I think the walls in the room are quite thin, though I was lucky I did not have noisy neighbours. The reception staff were ok, except for one who was abrupt - to the point of being discourteous. I was irritated that I had to notify this reception staff member that the ordinary room was not the one I reserved before he updated the charge to the lower rate for an unrenovated room.

If I had not said anything I would have paid a higher rate for an unrenovated room and I feel that was a little sneaky if not dishonest.

Several families appeared to be living in the hotel and they took very poor care of these community areas. There was almost always an unbelievable amount of urine EVERYWHERE. This was in addition to the masses of hair and the occasional undrained, dirty tub. The urine smell emanated throughout the entire hall throughout most of our stay. I thought I was going to vomit every time I walked to my room. The maids clean the bathrooms every morning but this is not enough. No locks on the windows - We stayed in two separate rooms during our 5 night stay and neither had locks on the windows. Worst of all, in the \"10\" rooms (110, 210,310....) the windows lead directly out the fire escape. The hall window, which was always open, also eads to the same fire escape. It would be very easy for someone to quickly pass from the hallway window and into our rooms.

As you can image, this quickly became a nuisance. On one occasion, I checked my key card to make sure it was working before I got in the shower. When I got out of the shower, my card had demagnetized. I was locked out of my room standing in only a towel until my spouse (in a towel also) made it down to the front desk to have our cards reprogrammed. Like other reviewer's have mentioned, the a/c unit is extremely loud and the free internet is only available from 7am to 10pm. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place to a friend.

There was hair in my bed the first night which was definitely not mine! One of the beds was tilted?! My sister slid over to me every night! Their was a window unit air conditioning, however it was freezing cold! The first night we had bugs that came in through the cracks. We told the front desk the next day and they basically ignored our problem and said that they may change our room. Later they had someone come with \"bug spray\" to spray down the room.. guess what the bug spray was?.. FEBREZE. Not even kidding. The elevator was HORRIBLE. It was suppose to be \"renovated\" but yeah I'm sure it was the cheapest one they could get. It was super small and stopped at every floor, whether there was someone there or not. 2 out of 3 nights, our room key did not work!

We are young folk from Canada looking to do sight-seeing and what-not, not expecting a romantic getaway or bells and whistles. We are very very simple people, we were not expecting much out of this place except a quiet safe place to sleep. 3 weeks before our trip I phoned them to confirm my reservation. The person on the other side of the phone said \"call tomorrow and ask for the reservation department\". There is no reservation department, he was just trying to get me to go away. I would soon learn that staff at The Alexander would use this \"come back later\" line A LOT. Finally after frequent phone calls they confirmed my room, 1 queen bed and private bath. Once we arrived, the indifferent person at the front desk show us to our room, which was on the ground floor off the lobby. The room had 2 twin beds. Not exactly what a young couple were looking for. We told this to the front desk who said he had no power to change this and to get it corrected in the morning, \"ask in the morning\" he said. What service. After wasting our time explaining the situation to the morning reception guy, he told us to go on with our day and once we are back everything will be moved. At this point we knew better and told them to move it now, and reluctantly they moved our things with us standing there, this time to a room with two queen beds. Not exactly what we wanted but we were exhausted with going back and forth with these people. The first night in this room was horrible, the heater would not stop making a noise which resembled bloody murder, and kept us up all night, and the neighbors (all of them) had a habit of slamming their doors whenever leaving and entering their rooms. To add to this the window did not open properly, so when we had to let some cold air in (BECAUSE THE HEATER WOULD NOT TURN OFF), it was a struggle. In addition, the walls were urine-color yellow, the wallpaper was winkled and peeling off the wall, obviously a product of a leak in the floor above and the hotel not caring. At some point we could only find all this amusing, as an attempt to not let it ruin our trip. What was there to do? Cancel and walk out onto the streets of New York hoping to find another hotel with a spot for us? When the front desk was presented with the simple question of \"where is my tv remote\", they repeatedly said \"when you come back it'll be in your room\". This happened for 3 days. Finally we got into a rile with them regarding this and it finally got resolved. The hotel is located near a subway station, which is nice but something not hard to come by in NYC. There are places that charge the same price as this dump and A LOT MORE FRIENDLY, RELIABLE, USEFUL, and won't flake out on you regarding every concern.

We just needed somewhere to sleep and shower - after all we didn't go to New York to stay in the hotel room! We went for a room with a shared bathroom because it was considerably cheaper than having a private bathroom. There was never a problem with this, and only 1 morning out of 5 did I ever find anyone else in it - and that just meant a 2 minute wait till they'd done. Main Advantages: - Hotel Alex is very reasonably priced - It's in a good location (1 block from the subway, close enough to the hustle and bustle without being too close). From here it's about 10-15 minutes on the train to Times Square. - The hotel was basic but clean. The rooms were an OK size, and had their own TV. - Hotel Alex is a 5 minute walk (maybe 10, depending on how fast you walk) to Central Park which is lovely to visit on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Main disadvantages (which were not major in my eyes): - The staff could have been a bit friendlier and helpful - after all, the odd 'please', 'thank you', 'good morning' and 'have a nice day', and even the odd smile do not cost anything. They weren't rude, but just didn't really give you that nice warm feeling you get from staying in a good hotel. For example, when we checked in the man handed us our room keys and then turned round have a drink, without saying the usual 'your room's on the ground floor, through the doors and turn right, have a nice stay'. Just seemed a little abrupt. But then in my eyes this is not a major flaw considering you get a cheap hotel. - The bathroom floors became very wet at times (from the shower/condensation), which made them quite slippy. However, we just asked the cleaning lady for an extra hand towel and used this as a bath mat. - Our room didn't have a huge amount of storage space, but did have 2 cupboards (1 of which was actually a v small room - I suspect orginally intended to be the toilet but was carpeted and had no plumbing). The only small problem with 2 big cupboards was that they could have done with having some shelves in them or some kind of storage device. - There was no safe in the room (I don't know if there may have been any at reception), but having said that, this is America, you need your passport and money to get a drink, and your camera to take photos, so other than maybe some paperwork (tickets/insurance) it's not a problem. We just left these (and a couple of MP3 players and some English \u00c2\u00a3) in the hotel room and they were prefectly safe (having said that we left the 'do not disturb' sign on the door all holiday - mainly because we didn't feel the need to get new towels and sheets for just 5 nights stay - you know, doing our bit for the environment and all!). None of these negative points were really an issue - after all you get what you pay for, and when I go on a long weekend city break I don't plan to spend much time in my hotel room!

As one would expect, what you get in Manhattan for one price is of a lower caliber than what you get for the same price elsewhere. I'll be objective: the place is clean, and it's within a block or two of parking options and a subway stop. That's a plus. Upon checkin, they also informed us that they have free Wi-Fi, and those without Wi-Fi capabilities can connect for 10 cents per minute in their lounge area. Additionally, they offer coffee in the mornings. If you want these things, those are also a plus. The Hotel Alexander is in a safe location in a pretty laid-back part of Manhattan. We noticed a lot of bakeries and coffee shops (good for a convenient breakfast), groceries, and Mexican restaurants in the vicinity. It's an unexciting area, but it's nice. The room: there was a dresser, a night table, a vanity (with a mirror), and a closet, which would all be good for a longer stay, if you needed to store things. The room also had a small armchair. The comforter was ripped, but the bedding was clean. There were three big windows (lots of light). If you're freezing at night, pull the blinds back and take a look at the window; they seem to leave the windows cracked, so that might be your problem. On to the bathroom: there is a shared bathroom for every corridor on a given floor. The bathroom has the usual -- sink, shower/tub, toilet, toilet paper, towel rack, wastebasket , window, mirror -- but nothing else. There's no soap dispenser either (Bring your own soap to the bathroom.). Also, you aren't supposed to flush the paper (You dispose of it in the wastebasket by the toilet.). If you've traveled in developing countries, this isn't novel. But I've actually never seen this before in the U.S.. Just be aware that they only seem to clean the bathroom once a day, and the wastebasket in your (shared) bathroom will contain other pepole's dirty toilet paper. If you're alright with this, then that's good. If you've never seen this before, you might be disgusted. Depends on where you've been. My friend was minorly inconvenienced by the fact that she had to ask at the front desk for towels and toilet paper (At one point, the bathroom ran out of it.), and that when she went downstairs for coffee in the morning, they were out of that as well. In a way, the staff seemed slightly unorganized; for instance, not keeping the bathrooms stocked with paper (for one), but also, on the morning we left, there was a pile of laundry on the elevator, just riding up and down the floors by itself. This isn't really a problem, but if you're a luxury traveler, you probably won't like this place. If all you want though is a clean place in a safe location, and you're looking for a cheap accomodation, the Hotel Alexander isn't bad. Just be aware that you could get a bigger, more comfortable room, in a hotel much closer to the more exciting parts of Manhattan, for the same price, by looking somewhere like Jersey City. Would I stay here again? Probably not.

I've looked at many reviews sites online for this hotel and other \"cheap\" ones and this is the best price/value available. Reservations: I made the reservations online and had absolutely no problem. I got exactly what I had asked for. If you're worried about it, call them and make sure the reservation went thru, but this was unnecessary for us. Overall, It cost me about $220 for two nights!

We then proceeded to go in the \"lounge\" to use the bathroom, change our clothes and freshen up. The hotel let us put all of our luggage into a storage closet for free, since our rooms would not be ready until later in the afternoon. Room: Our room was small, but it had what we needed and you need to remember that this is NYC - Everything is small unless you pay the big bucks (over $600.00). There was a bed, a desk, a night table with a lamp, an alarm clock, a head/-to-toe miroir and a TV with cable. They also left towels, face cloths, soap and shampoo at our arrival. We put our room as \"DO NOT DISTURB\" even when we were not there, so I can't say anything about room cleaning other than what we got when checked-in - a clean room. We were only there for three days, so we really did not need our bedsheets changed... (Trying to do my part for the environment) Bathrooms: There's 4 complete bathrooms on each floors. Very basic (tub with shower, toilet and sink). They are cleaned several times a day. The one near my room was always clean and available. My boyfriend got a busy bathroom once but then just proceeded to walk down the hall to another one. It's NOT a big deal. You could always try another floor if all four of the bathrooms were taken on yours (which I doubt would happen!). I did bring flip-flops to take my shower, but It was clean enough that I really didn't have too. My bf didn't use any. For about $50.00/night extra, you can get a room WITH a bathroom but we thought it was not worth it, since we were spending so little time in our room. Lounge: They have free coffee there, and there's a few tables, chairs and couches. There's also a big screen TV , a few computers and some vending machines. Internet is $1 for 10 minutes. We've used it once to find a specific restaurant we had heard of and it works great. No credit card needed. Staff: Nice. We had to wait around for someone to show up once, but only for a few minutes so cannot complain about that. Elevators: There is an elevator, but it is very slow and VERY small. We took it to bring our luggages up and we could only fit ourselves (average) and two suitcases. Another guy was waiting for the elevator and could not get in!! Without luggage, you can probably squize 4 people in there. We were happy to be on the 4th floor. We used the staircases for the remainder of the trip. Therefor, I do NOT recommand this hotel for someone with disabilities. Location: It is not downtown, but it is very easily accessible and the neighbourhood is nice and quiet. The Subways 1,2,3 is just a block away, there are a few buses too that come every 5 minutes and you're about 11$ + tip away from timesquare in a cab! Also, The nearest subway station is a \"main\" one, meaning that you can also take express subways and it will stop there! On a regular train, it takes about 15 minutes to timesquare, but on an express, it's 5 minutes! The walk to the subway station is less than 5 minutes. Literrally 2 blocks away. Check-Out: We checked out in the morning but again, left our luggages in the storage locker for the remainder of the day as our bus back was only leaving at night. They didn't charge us anything extra, though their website says they'll charge you $1/bag. Keep in mind that hotel is a 1* hotel in NYC!!! This City is an exception to the general rule of hotel elsewhere - everything is overpriced. Don't expect anything fancy. Hotel Alexander gives you a SAFE and CLEAN place to sleep. That's IT. If you're thinking of actually spending time in your room, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. We got up at 8 am every morning, were gone until 5pm, came back to change our clothes and then were back out until 1am. Overall, if you're on a budget, can walk up a few floors and just want a clean and safe place to sleep, I very much recommand this hotel....

We didn't expect anything fancy nor want it since it was just gonna be a place to to rest our heads whilst discovering beautiful NYC. Firstly, having been alerted to the problems some previous reviewers experienced when booking on the website, I decided to make sure they had our booking and phoned them from France where I live. After being told to call back 3 times (the night guy wasn't \"able\" to confirm) I eventually was told that they didn't have my booking on their computer but not to worry 'cos it would be downloaded soon...this was 5 days after booking! When I insisted I wanted him to check, he hung up the phone! When I called back, he answered and put the phone way from his ear before hanging up several times. Enraged, but especially worried about our booking I sent a mail and eventually they replied giving me a confirmation number...good start! The beginning of our stay went alright; hotel is nicely located in upper west side, near metro. Even the shared bathrooms wasn't a major problem (for me anyhow, more so for my wife), you could always find one on other floors in okish condition. The rooms are old and sparsely decorated but what you expect for that category hotel. So I appreciate why most people evaluate it as good value for money. But you recognise what a hotel is really like when there's a problem: On our third night (we were staying for 4) in the middle of the night our radiator (which hadn't been working until then! leaving the room quite cold..) suddenly started making lots of noise and eventually hissing out steam into the room. After subsiding , it then started again and got worse. I phoned reception straigth away and his contribution was \"don't worry it'll stop..\" He couldn't change our room cos the hotel was fully booked up After it had got disturbingly worse , and I'd held the phone to the radiator to wake up the useless guy at reception, and forced him to come to the room to witness it, we had to leave our room and go outside. My wife was in tears and I was getting more annoyed with this guy who didn't care less Low and behold we bumped into another couple at reception who had the same problem in their room, and had to leave their room too!! Our room was 411 . Theirs was on the 6th floor I actually tried to alert the fire brigade via the fire alert but the guy at reception kept running up and disabling it. Since I didn't want to spoil my holiday by aggressing him I gave up and ignored him since he was I'd realised by now just useless. Eventually he had no other choice but to turn off the central heating in the hotel, which he didn't want to do beforehand because he \"didn't want to get complaints from the guests\" (good one that!) and thus we managed to get 2 hours' \"relaxation\" in our room cos naturally we didn' sleep after what had happened... The next day we managed to change room, no thanks to \"our friend\" the night guy who hadn't even told the others in the hotel about the problem! To finish this happy story, I eventually managed to corner the manager, who'd been trying to avoid me the morning we were leaving, and I exposed the story to him...he hadn't even heard about it at that stage! His words of wisdom were \"that\"s unfortunate\" I informed him that naturally we expected some discount here, he said \"Don't worry, we'll make you happy\" I found out when checking out that this consisted of a 50$ discount (about a third of the price for one night!) Anything less than not paying for the night of the incident was an insult by any standards, but at that stage I just laughed to myself I was realising this would be a funny story to tell... So basically if you have a problem on your stay expect the worst customer service ever experienced, and I've been to a lot of places over the world...

All day long there was also free coffee in the lounge. We use to buy pastries and fruits on Broadway in the evening and eat them for breakfast next morning. The staff was helpful and friendly. The room itself was beyond our expectation. It was big enough with a queen bed, 2 desks and 2 chairs, a closet and a cabled TV.

We hade maid service every day with fresh sheets and towel and complimentary toiletries (soap and shampoo). Of course, the furnitures were The only thing I have to complain about is that the doors were slaming loudly sometimes in the nights, so if you are a light sleeper I suggest that you bring ear plugs with you! The bathroom was also beyond our expectations. It was cleaned twice a day and honestly I didn't find a single hair in the bath every time I used it. The only thing I didn't like with the bathroom was that there's no soap and towel in the bathroom so it's not very useful for handwashing. The hotel is VERY close to the subway (2 streets east) and to Broadway which was very convenient for all the restaurants, pharmacies and corner stores. The neibourghood made me feel secure and we were also very close to Central Park. In conclusion, for the price we paid for a room in New York it was beyond expectations and perfect for our needs.

With all the 5 star ratings, I suspect the hotel management is rating their own hotel. The first room we were given on the 7th floor. The one small elevator was usually kept busy by the housekeeping staff or other guests (up to 5 minutes), so it was quicker to use the stairs. When we complained that the bed had lube soaking from the mattress through the thin sheet (no mattress pad) we were promptly given a new room on the first floor. It was nice to not have to climb the stairs or wait for the elevator. Other than the having very thin sheet between you and a nasty mattress from 1973, the rooms were sparse but ok. The bathrooms only had a small window for ventilation so the bathroom and hallway usually smelled like someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bowl movement.

Also, it is hard to find a dry place to put your things while you shower, let alone find a dry spot to step. Think of it as a game. If there is absolutely no where else to stay, this is your place.

Their website makes it look so great, and doesn't really explain things to you. The rooms were clean, but were just a step up from a hostel. The hallways always smelled, sometimes so much that I couldn't stand out in them for more than seconds. The elevator there is only fit for 3, and I really mean 3 regular sized people. I, being somewhat claustrophobic, decided to forgo it all together for my weekend stay, and used the elevator, though my room was on the fourth floor. Good exercise after all that food and drinks I had that weekend. They say there's a lounge, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more like a room with some chairs, internet (you pay for it, don't know how much), and the coffee was horrible, there wasn't any cream or milk, but I know I was asking too much, right? I don't know what was worse, the bathroom or the service. The bathrooms were shared bathroom, which they mention on the website, but I assumed it meant sharing with one or two other rooms, not the whole hallway. It was very small, with at tub (don't know why they just didn't make it a shower; no one should let their bodies touch that thing). The shower curtain was so disgusting, like it's been there for years. The toilet, when clean is usable (if your lucky to be the first one to use it right after the maids clean it), but most of the time isn't. The floor gets extremely wet after any one shower, even if you take the quickest shower ever. ****Bring flip-flops to shower in. If you forget, you can buy cheap ones on Broadway, two streets away from the \"hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Also bring your own towels too. Might as well bring soap, shampoo, conditioner, and toothpaste. They provide the first three, but they are the worst quality. **** The service there was really bad. I realized this first at check in, when the guy checking us in seemed full of attitude; then when my friend asked for a iron, and the same guy gave her more attitude, warning her that she had to bring it back (you could buy a better iron at Wal-Mart for 10 bucks, lol); third incident was when my other friend asked for a band aid, and they only gave her one, saying that if she needed more, there was a pharmacy down the street. The only positive things about the hotel were: They let us check in late (12-1am); the location was close to a lot of things (restaurants, stores); the neighborhood was safe; they didn't complain about us making noise, or returning to the hotel at 5am; we found free parking on the street (we got lucky our first night, the second night we got a $125 ticket when we parked two streets away). It was the cheapest place we could find for that weekend, seeing how it is summer and there was a big event in NYC that weekend, but for $400+ for two nights, do you blame me for expecting just a little bit more of the place?

We were mislead by their advertising through expedia.com. There was only one bathroom to share between 6-10 other rooms on the floor. Second, we were treated very poorly by the staff. We had requested a cot the first night, upon which we were told to wait until the following day to request a cot because the maids were gone for the night at 6pm when we arrived. The next day, we asked another person at the front desk if we could request a cot for the night and he said, \"Well, we don't have any cots, so what do you think about that?!\" We didn't even know how to respond! We didn't understand why it was neccessary to treat us so rudely, when we asked a simple question, and, when we were told the day before it would not be an issue. Finally, it was a hastle to shower in this hotel. We were never provided with the same amount of towels and had to hunt the maids down (only in the morning when they were available) to get the number of towels that we needed. And when we asked the front desk for help, they were extremely rude to us again! We strongly feel that we did not deserve this kind of treatment and it did take away from our experience in New York City. We feel compelled to do something so that the next person is not mislead or treated this way. The staff and management at Hotel Alexander should know that is it not acceptable to treat people who are paying $200+/night to stay at their facility and it will not be tolerated.

Moreover the hotel is situated in a quiet and safe area where I always felt comfortable. The overall service is good and friendly, but you should not expect five star treatment. But then again you get what you pay for and what you pay is somewhat cheap compared to other hotels in Manhattan. At the time we looked into booking this was in fact the cheapest I could find (not including hostels) and trust me I searched a lot. When trying to book a room you should always see what the price is on their homepage and compare it with hotel booking sites. We saved around 20% when booking at their homepage! An other advantage is that there is a subway very close by as well is eating (you have to try breakfast at the Key West Diner on Broadway between 94th and 95th) and shopping possibilities (all of Broadway is in fact filled with shops, delis and cafes). Overall I can recommend this for persons who are looking for a good and clean place to stay in NYC where you use the hotel as your base for exploring the city.

There's an entrance at Broadway and 94th to the 96th st. station where the 1, 2 and 3 trains all stop. Central Park is also less than 1 km away on foot. The internet access in the room is decent, but you need a cable; there's no wireless network. You need to pay $10 in advance at the front desk (for each day until noon the next day) and if you don't have a cable already they'll provide you with one.

They all appear to be 1st generation immigrants, Arabs, Indians etc, and sometimes act accordingly. But mostly they're very service minded, great guys that do their stuff by the book (whatever book that may be). A few points of advice: - Bring a few towels of your own, as sometimes you might only get small towels. - Don't get the guy at the front desk to get you a taxi to the airport or elsewhere as you will most likely NOT get an authorized taxi, but a rather expensive buddy of his that WILL try to scam you. He drove us through Harlem on the way to JFK, which I honestly didn't like, although it's probably a lot safer than it used to be, and might be the quickest route for all I know. - The hotel does not have a safe, but they do have a pretty safe storage room for your luggage. I wouldn't leave anything valuable there, though, unless it's in a firmly locked suitcase. - I've seen some people complain about the elevator being slow. I honestly don't think it is.

The room was nice, with 2 windows, heating, television, closet to walk in, everything was clean, and we even had a large sized mirror. bathroom was next door, 2 on the floor (apparently 3, in the aisle on the other site of the elevator) and it was never really a problem getting the bathroom. sometimes u would have to wait for 5 minutes but really this was NOT A PROBLEM AT all. Staff cleaned bathrooms frequently. just 2 minutes to the metro, direct metro connection to timessquare and all the main spots in the centre, the only thing the elevator was quite slow, but it was always a challange to see who is quicker elevator or walking and if u dont mind walking its not a problem. Beds were comfortable maybe blankets a little thin so in winther a little cold, but i am usually frozen so this might not really mean a lot. Tv programms were ok, remote control, snacks in the lobby to get for little money, and coffee for free in the tv common room. in the near area many foodplaces and restuarants for very good prices! go to broadway and turn right, some meters and there is a big take a way place, with pizza, cake, salat, paninis, sandwiches and so on!!! nice staff there too and so close! Very nice hotel with very nice staff and i will definitely stay there again next time i come to new york.", "Date": "January 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cwhat a bargain in NYC!\u201d", "Author": "Cretey", "ReviewID": "UR12480671", "Content": "After reading some of the reviews I was a little concerned but since we were after a hotel for less than $100 a night, we couldn't be picky.

Because I was staying in Manhattan in the highest peak of December, when any hotel would charge a fortune, I decided to go for the cheapest option. The initial impression wasn't really the best, as it reminded me of the premises of the college I went, when I was a student. However, the room was really quiet and clean. The shared bathroom was a bit inconvenient, but I knew that in advance, so no surprises! I wouldn't spend more than two nights there as it's not the type of place that makes you willing to stay longer but it serves its purpose and in comparison to others hotels in NY, it is good value. There is a typical American diner just up the road on Broadway (called Key West Diner & Cafe) where they serve delicious pancakes and offer great service. In my opinion these little amenities near the hotel really complemented my stay. The final verdict is that I would recommend Alexander Hotel mainly to students, but if you are really keen to save your money and don't mind the shared bathroom, go for it (but don't expect much!).", "Date": "January 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood all-round affordable accommodation\u201d", "Author": "parityerror", "ReviewID": "UR11563315", "Content": "Rooms: Small room, however as I was only planning on sleeping in the room (out and about during the day and evenings), this was adequate. Room was cleaned daily, very happy with cleanliness. There is a wardrobe and closet. Shared Bathroom: This wasn't a problem for me. If they were busy I could use one on another floor. two bathrooms per floor, reasonably good ratio General hotel: Not noisy. Internet downstairs in lobby, $1 for ten minutes. Reception was very helpful. Bags can be left in locked room at reception if arriving before checking in or leaving after check-out time. Hotel staff can book taxi to airport, etc. There aren't any facilities, such as \"room service\", meals, etc, but hey, its New York, you don't need to be at the hotel except to sleep. Elevator is slow, but most of the time there wasn't much demand for it. Location: Subway station was 2 blocks away, about 3 minutes walk. The express subway then took me straight to times square and other good tourist locations. About 30 minutes to get from La Guardia to the hotel, then about 75 minutes (in rush hour) to get to JFK. Hotel can advise of best travelling times. There didn't appear to be anywhere nearby to park a car, I would suggest taking public transport or taxi. Safety: I felt very safe and secure in the hotel. The area of New York was reasonably safe, day and night, however I am a 23 year old male. There were some far worse areas of NY than this area. I wasn't approached by strangers at all. I didn't see any \"dodgy people\" nearby either. Nearby food: There was a great diner on 7th Avenue and (I think) 96th St which did breakfast. Fantastic food.

We never had a problem getting into a bathroom as if the ones on our floor were full we would just hop down to the next floor until we found one that was free. It just required a little more legwork. The location was very good. It is only a block and a half from the 1/2/3 lines subway station, and a few blocks from central park. The neighborhood was quiet and we felt safe at all times.
