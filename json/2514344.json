I chose it because of its location and because of the price. I doubt you could find a better priced hotel in the area. If you want to spend an extra 100 then you could probably stay at another hotel in Manhattan but this hotel is fairly priced and not overpriced like the other 3 star hotels in the area. I asked for a newly renovated room when I checked in. I also checked in at 6 in the morning so I am very grateful to the clerk who checked me in early with no hesitation. I was staying on 10 floor. The room seemed to have new bedding and curtains. The carpet did not look new but it was not dirty. The bathroom was small but very clean. There was some rust on the toilet but nothing to complain about. Remember that this is an old property in New York city. Because of all the bed big reviews I took the time to inspect the room before settling in. I ripped the bedding apart and moved furniture and looked behind picture frames. I came up with nothing. Not even a dead cockroach. It was very clean! When staying in a hotel in midtown I only have two requests. No bed bugs and the rooms needs to be clean. You can't expect much else for the price. 150 a night in New York will buy you a high class room in a Motel 8. That's how far 150 goes in the area. Know what you are buying before you complain. That being said I am disappointed that I wasn't told at check in that the AC was not working. I called down later that night and the desk clerk told me they didn't turn on the AC until April. Which is fine. If that's how they run their hotel I have no problem with that but I would have appreciated being told at check in. They quickly offered an electric fan for the room. I asked for two and they brought the fans quickly. The fans helped a lot and because it was not hot outside I didn't really need AC. This would be a big issue in the summer time. I would suggest calling to make sure the property has AC. My only other complaint is that the smoke from the room upstairs came down into our room from the bathroom vents. I'm not smoker so it did bother me. I was not in the room very often so I did not complain. I would stay at this property again. The rooms are not the best but they are the best that I could afford. There are plenty of cheap hotels in NYC if you are willing to commute. Overall, they have nice clean rooms. Great housekeeping staff. Friendly front desk. Great location. Great prices. Could use some updates but I felt like I got what I paid for. If you have an extra 100 a night to spend then spend it! There are nicer properties. Either way. It's NYC.

While some things did not look too dirty, when extra towels were delivered and I accidentally hit the wall with one, it was covered in black dirt. Similarly, when we moved the dresser to plug in a phone charger, there was dirt and garbage behind it. The bathroom also was not as clean as it should have been upon arrival (but got a little better the next two days). The bathroom also had an awkward layout, and as the sink and counter are in a separate are there was no place to put anything needed for shower time (might not be an issue for a couple or family, but could be awkward for groups of friends). The service at the hotel was mixed. Our check-in and check-out were easy, and front staff and housekeeping were generally ready to help when needed. However, the concierge wanted to charge us an obscene amount of $ to make a local call to quickly ask a question of a venue we were attending later and would not even use his computer to look something up as we were leaving for the day.

The lobby itself is below average and you do happen to have a lot of staff available there. The rooms are extremely outdated and in desperate need of a complete makeover. The internet is free in this hotel but that is a very bad idea. There are times where the network gets so overloaded that nothing works at all. Either restrict free internet to priority club members and paying customers or upgrade your connections. Or at least, offer another connection that is fast and reliable for the priority club members and/or paying customers. Not being able to load google for an hour during the night every night before everyone goes to bed is not really an internet connection. Noise in the corridors and the proximity of an ice machine to the room was very bothersome. That is specially because the doors and walls are not noise proof. The lack of a fridge in the room was also not good. It would be nice to have a minibar or at least an empty fridge to stock items in it during the stay. The cupboard in the room is just a disaster. The TV is almost ancient, did not know that those TVs still exist. Some of the staff members are helpful and nice to deal with, the others are just simply rude. The feeling I got was that the place was run by a mafia rather than just employees. Had to reserve a car for my friend to catch his flight since we were advised by the concierge at the time that we need to do that to avoid traffic (on a Sunday!!!) and because we wouldn't find a cab at that time. After agreeing to the time, my friend and I waited in the lobby and made sure the staff there knew we were waiting for the reserved hotel car to pick him up. We were there 10 minutes prior to the supposed arrival time and nothing showed up 20 minutes after the agreed upon time. Went outside and got hold of the first cab within under 5 seconds, and my friend was in the airport in under 20 minutes for half the fare the hotel wanted to charge us for. There was a bit of an unprofessional reaction from the staff in the hotel to that claiming that the car is coming, nearby and that what we did was wrong. The way this was communicated was very bad, in a thuggish way and left me with a very bad impression. Again, the staff member who was upset most was throwing words in his native language not knowing that other people may understand other languages.

I was going to cancel, but instead called the hotel directly, explained that I am a Priority Club Platinum member and requested a renovated room which I was assured of. Upon arrival when I asked if there was an upgrade available for Platinum members I was told that all the rooms were the same. No problem - I then just asked for the best available room. the room he gave us was right at the elevator. It had at least a 1\" gap all around the door and not even a threshold so the noise from the elevator bells and people congregating while waiting just came right through into our room. The room was ok, but was set up for only 2 people (my reservation was for 3). When I tried to call the desk to ask for more towels guess what - no working phone. We left to walk to Central Park which was just a few blocks (maybe 3) and stopped by the front desk to tell them about the towels and phone. This time I had the Priority Club representative. I told her about the two issues then also about our room placement and asked if that was the \"best\". She responded that it was in fact the \"worst\". (clearly the guy who checked us in was just being a jerk) She didn't offer to switch us so I just said \"well, gee thanks a lot for giving us the worst room\" and left. When we returned planning to shower and hit the beds it was close to midnight and we were all sopping wet as it had been pouring rain. They had not delivered the extra towels and the phone still didn't work so I had to go back down to the main lobby to again request towels. Also, our heater wouldn't turn off which we didn't know until we got back. We had turned it down before leaving and it was even hotter than before when we got returned. Since I wasn't making another trip to the lobby to report it we opened the window as much as possible and had a restless night. Overall a bad experience. Oh and the perk for being Platinum at this property is a free muffin or coffee in the restaurant for me only meaning the other two would have to pay. this is just a way to put paying customers in their restaurant. What a joke! We walked down the street to a great little cafe so I can't speak about the food at this property. It's really a shame that they don't do a better job with customer service here as the location is really quite nice.

On arrival we found that our booking had been \"lost\". We got given a voucher for a complimentary muffin and juice and told to come back. We went and redeemed our vouchers and got given the items in takeaway form. We had no choice other than to sit in the lobby and eat it. We were rudely told by a staff member that there was no eating in the lobby! Not really our choice since we didn't have a room nor were we offered a table in the restaurant to eat at! On going back to reception they still couldn't find our booking and promised they were looking into it. They insisted that we pay for the first nights accommodation even though our stay was already paid for. They insisted this would be immediately refunded once the booking had been sorted, we didn't really have a choice at this point so had to agree. We went up to our room and let me say this is the WORST Holiday Inn I have ever seen. The room stank of stale urine, the carpets, linen, walls were dirty. There was a hole in the roof. The bathroom was filthy. The toilet didn't flush, the phone didn't work. We asked for maintenance to come up and have a look but they couldn't fix any of the problems. So we went back to reception to request to be moved. The staff were rude and unfriendly and that goes for the duty manager as well. They gave us another room which was no better in my opinion, but as by this point we had already wasted half a day of our holiday we gave up and went out for the day. The following morning we woke to find an unopened block of chocolate had been nibbled at by some form of rodent. We went back down to reception again. We told them the problem and the reply was \"so, i suppose you want another room\" complete with an eye roll. We got moved again and offered free breakfast for 2 days and insisted on a fridge free of charge (they charge $10 per day for a fridge which is ridiculous!) Our 3rd room, whilst bigger was just as awful. Dirty carpets, walls and linen, and a hole in the roof. The bathroom was clean but small. They ask you to recycle your towels which we were more than happy to do but the only rail they provide to hang your towels on sits over the top of the bench. So not really enough room to hang a full sized bath towel! So that left us really no choice other than to receive new towels every day as there was no way to dry them. We never ordered room service but from what I could see the service wasn't great at all. We would see dirty dishes still sitting in the hall over 24 hours later! No wonder they have a rodent problem! Upon checking my friends credit card statement she found that she had been charged over $700 by Holiday Inn! We asked 3 different staff members what there \"incidental\" charges were. One person said $50, another said $300 and the duty manager in response to telling her about the charges rudely told us that there incidental charges are $100 per day for every day of your stay! Well if this is in fact the case staff should be telling patrons upon check in as this is a lot of money! The amounts charged on her credit card were neither of the amounts stated to us above but were different amounts every day .... it seemed to us as though they were recharging us for the room even though it was already paid for! We said the money needed to be refunded immediately as we still had another week of traveling. Her reply simply was that it could take weeks! We were not impressed by this point. My friend had to fill in more paperwork and provide them ID, bank details etc just so she could get her own money back which they should never have taken in the first place! The money eventually got refunded after a few days. Their hospitality promise is that if any part of your stay does not meet your expectations then that particular aspect would be refunded. We continually tried to get in contact with the manager via email and phone and we never ever received a response. We eventually, on return to Australia, had to go through the priority club website who then got in contact with them. This took several different tries before they eventually responded to us! Not exactly a very good way to run a business! Eventually they agreed to refund half of our stay but by the time you take out fees etc it did not even cover 2 nights accommodation! Considering the amount we paid to stay there we were not happy. I have advised our travel agent not to recommend this hotel to anyone. I have also warned family, friends and acquaintances traveling to new york not to stay here. We were disgusted at the treatment we received from staff and the state of the accommodation. There were signs everywhere stating they were renovating but I certainly never saw any sign of this. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

While it does have a bar and a high-priced restaurant on its inners, the most important part - the rooms, leave much to be desired. I booked this hotel through a bid on Priceline so the price was excellent for the stay, however I'd have been willing to pay a \"few dollars\" more for better quality. The hotel is in an excellent location just a few blocks from Central Park South, but that's the best I can say. Though I must add, that unfortunately, this is one of a group of hotels that says...\"you paid the Priceline price, therefore you will receive Priceline service. Upon arrival, I was checked in by Yudith who was totally unwelcoming. We didn't receive as much as a hello...just a demand for name and ID followed up with a request for a credit card for extra services. Upon signing necessary paperwork I noticed that I was assigned to a queen bed smoking room. (I did read prior reviews saying that the smoking room is a normal assignment for Priceline guests.) I asked for a non-smoking room because I have severe allergies and cannot stand the smell of smoke. Yudith promptly responded that she had no ability to change us to a non-smoking room. I explained my understanding of Priceline's bedding warning, but was hoping that they may be able to accomodate me. Yudith again replied that there was nothing she could do until later in my stay, but something decided to make her look again and she changed the rooms. I can understand non-availability as I've worked for hotels, but say that don't place the lie on Priceline. However, as this is the second time I've had this level of service connected to a Priceline room, I'm reconsidering patronizing them if this is what their partners will give. The hotel did have signs saying that they were completing rennovations, but I failed to see any evidence of that on the elevator with chipped paint on the door, a failure to operate upon pushing the floor button and severe shaking and creaking once it finally began to move. The hallway we were assigned to was lined with dirty, and bleach-faded carpeting. The room itself was small, had a \"brown\" stained comforter on the very uncomfortable bed, and of course, the vent in the bathroom filled the room with- you guessed it- a terrible stench of smoke. When we requested \"sets\" of towels we were simply brought towels...no washcloths, hand towels, etc. The bathroom was also small and had the exposed rusted pipes of a public bathroom. The replacement comforter was wrinkled and dingy. The curtains/shades in the room are also sheer and do not close completely which gave the people in the adjacent building an embarassing view of things that should remain private. Summarily, I would not wish to stay here again, and I don't reccomend you do either. Perhaps my experience would have been better if I'd been placed in a renovated room, but as a Priceline guest, i'm sure that outcome would have been an impossibility.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201c+location, +room size, -elevators, -priceline\u201d", "Author": "travel2much2", "ReviewID": "UR122261729", "Content": "You'd be hard pressed to get a better location (2 blocks to columbus circle subway) and a quieter stay on this residential street near the action, restaurants and bars.

There was mould all along the bath/shower and you hardly had room to swing the proverbial cat,and no storage space at all for toiletries etc..

The problem appears to be lack of ventilation in the bathroom,there is no fan so therefore it never really dries out after use and the mirror gets so steamed up you can't see.On a plus note, the hairdyer was good,the beds were clean & comfy & the coffee machine was a nice touch.Also there is free WiFi connection.The restaurant is adequate and does serve a good breakfast,however there are a few diners nearby so you are not stuck for choice.

The hotel was ideally located near Central Park. and walking distance to most attractions at Broadway and Times Square. However what turned out next was totally unexpected. First they gave us a room at the smoking area but during our reservation we specifically stated we wanted a non smoking room. We were later informed that the hotel is fully booked and that there are no more available rooms left. We had no choice but to get it. Secondly upon entering the room we noticed that the airconditioning unit was not working. We repeatedly called the front desk and duty manager but we were surprised to hear their explanation: Sorry sir its the time of year when all airconditioning units are being serviced for the upcoming winter season. You could just open your windows if you want your room to be cooler. They even explained that this is occuring at all their holiday inn and holiday inn express hotels in new york. That realy made our stay uncomfortable. We called the holiday inn at west 29th street and asked them if they are undergoing the same procedure. The manager there denied this and told us that their airconditioning unit was working fine and no scheduled interruption was ever made. This contradicted to what the manager of our hotel had to say thus we just decided to trasfer to a different hotel the next day and asked them to refund us of our payments for the remaining intended duration of our stay. The duty manager was apologetic and told us that night that they would just not charge us for our stay for the night. However upon check out the following day they still billed us for the room and told us that no such endorsement was made to the front desk. We were so dissapointed that we just wanted to get out of the hotel and enjoy the remaining days of our vacation that we decided to let them charge us but not after informing the manager and some of the guests at the reception of our horrific experience. Fortunately before grabbing our ride the front desk officer approached as and told us that they would just reverse the charges and apologized for their mistakes.

My second room smelled much fresher, but was a bit stuffy. I would later find out that air conditioning in this hotel (or at least this room) was seasonal.

They are trying to \"update\" the rooms but really just putting on a band-aid. Evidence of delapidated ceilings with popcorn ceiling sprayed over top. Cracks in the walls, dirty corners in the bathroom, extremely worn and outdated furniture, uneven floors. I had a tray of food from a previous guest sitting outside my room for over 24 hours hours-gross! I called housekeeping at different times and the phone just rang. This also happened when trying to call the front desk a few times. No one ever answered the phone. A huge issue for me was that there was no air in the rooms! We all know there isn't much of a breeze with open windows in NYC with so many buildings. The room was hot and stuffy and I had to request a fan from housekeeping. The last issue that just erks me is that they post charges for keeping your lugguage. I travel 3-4 months out of the year staying at a variety of hotels throughout the U.S. and abroad. This is the only hotel I have ever seen try to charge for storing guests' luggage. Are you kidding me!? Also when I left I tried to ask a bellman for help getting a taxi to the airport. There were two huge tour buses in the street blocking any view of taxis. Two bellman just kept trying to push the hotel car which is of course a considerable amount more than a flat rate taxi. This is a hotel that attracts A LOT of tourists and non-residents. We are not all proficient in hailing a cab. It just a common courtesy for hotel to assist guests in getting where they need to go...by the transportation means that the GUEST wants. I ended up wheeling my luggage up the block where I could see the street and hail my own cab. I have stayed at other Holiday Inns and have had a good experience.

Basic toiletries were provided, with more available from reception on request. The room had air conditioning. The decor was a little tired, but the reception, lifts, corridors and rooms were clean, however there was dust behind the TV and desk etc. The bed was comfortable and a selection of pillows were available. The hotel offered free wifi, that was excellent (some reviews have mentioned problematic connections, but we did not experience any problems at all).

We've always had one in our room before and use it for passports etc. there was a sign on the door (noticed on our last day!) stating that limited safe space was available in reception for an additional fee.

We never saw anyone woking on the elevator then on the 5th day it was back in service. 2nd--on our first morning we decided to eat breakfast n the hotel--big mistake. Not only was the food in the buffet cold, but it was of poor quality. The waiters and busboys stood around chatting instead of taking care of the customers. 3rd--Our room was small and dingey. The bathtub had mold around the edges and the carpet was dirty. 4th and last, when the weather turned cold, so did our room. I called the front desk because I couldn't figure out how to turn on the heat. I was told that the hotel would not be turning on the heat for another week when summer oficially ended.

Got stuck on super hot during the kid's shower - I could not make the handle budge. Finally called housekeeping who sent up a maint. man - he fixed it quickly, but said and I QUOTE - \"Not the first time, not the last time.\" SO, I guess that means the hotel is aware of problem and doesn't FIX IT. Thanks to this incident, we were late. The ice machines are not on every floor, and not all of them work. Skip breakfast - the food is okay, but the staff is rude and has no sense of urgency - you'll see them texting in the corner - and when they do bring the food, they almost throw it at you... instead, walk over to the Europa Cafe on the next block [8th Ave] for a good breakfast and great service. The walls are T H I N. We heard all people going in and out of the doors [they slam] and the man next door was having a great time with a \"rental\" - they were extremely loud...or maybe it was the walls. Now the good part - the location is fabulous. Close to the subway. 57th Street is a 2 way street, so you can hail a cab in either direction. Walk to museums, the park, etc. The computers in the lobby aren't free, but you can print your boarding passes pretty cheap. The concierge can book anything for you. There is a parking lot at the hotel. The staff was helpful, except in the cafe. The thing about being in NYC is you don't want to be in your hotel room. I guess if you can sleep and shower, you're good - too bad that wasn't so easy on this trip!", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing waste of good money\u201d", "Author": "tryinghar", "ReviewID": "UR116285307", "Content": "Whilst understanding New York is expensive, I am horrified that this hotel actually gets away with ripping people off so badly.

Our experience was somewhat different to this, majority of staff were helpful (mostly they were just slow), the room was clean and large enough for a family for 5 nights in fact the room was surprisingly large for NYC. The bathroom was slightly tired but was clean and functional. The a/c worked for the time we were there, therefore ticking all of our boxes. The beds were also very comfortable after a long day in a very hot city. An added benefit was free wi-fi in the hotel and this proved extremely useful in avoiding expensive roaming fees. The only element I was surprised at was no room safe - we did use the free safety deposit boxes in reception and these were small and slightly inconvenient to use - a member of staff had to open with you as they held a 2nd key. The Holiday Inn has an odd configuration (2 towers), we were overlooking the pool on the 12th floor, the pool was great to cool off after some v hot days but were suprised by the very early closing times - check times if you intend to use. Location was also very good (for our plans) 57th & 9th Ave, close to subway (Columbus Circle), possible to walk to Times Sq etc. At the end of a long hard sightseeing day the taxi fare's to return to hotel were not overly expensive so location wise we were more than happy.

Needless to say I stumbled backwards and nearly broke the mirror to the closet behind me trying to backpeddle as quickly as possible. I have heard of bed bugs and roaches in hotel rooms, but rats!? Wow! Anyway, the rat scurried by me and went under my bed probably trying to get away from me as quickly as I was trying to get away from it. What was unsettling was when I called the front desk for assistance the clerk stated,\"Welcome to New York City. Rats are everywhere. Get used to it.\". There was no apology or concern.

When I explained to her that I was not going to stay in that room again (room 1532) she suddenly became irritated as if I was ruining her night!! Wow! After some additional detail as to the size of the rat and the fact that I was not going to be able to sleep in that room again we were reluctantly changed to the 14th floor to a smokers room that smelled terrible--the bottom line is that we didn't get any sleep and we all felt terrible the next day. For the price of this room I expected at least some semblence of common courtesy from the staff--what I ended up with was feeling totally insulted. If any members of the Holiday Inn management team happen to read this review I sincerely hope that you take this review seriously and work to improve your staffs people skills. If my wife, one of my children or myself had been bitten by the rat I can guarantee you that this matter would not have been so easily dismissed! I understand that things like this can happen in a big city like New York, what I can't understand is why I was treated like I was an annoyance for bringing it to their attention!!!", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNotnthe best!\u201d", "Author": "0414travel", "ReviewID": "UR114782409", "Content": "Although hotel is situated in a reasonable location I would pay the extra to stay closer to 5th ave or even Times Square.

It's also Reasonably-Priced for Midtown Manhattan business hotels with room service and an on-premises health club - rooms run from under $200/night most of the year (you're usually looking to pay double-triple that), room service is Holiday Inn-level okay (heavy on the high-cholesterol foods and red meat, with good-but-not-great preparation that takes a while to deliver), and the Health Club is full-service though more geared towards serious gym rats than business travelers. The neighborhood has a variety of restaurants, drugstores and grocery stores and even Columbus Circle Mall within a few block's walk, and is safe for foot traffic even at night - admittedly, we'd lived in NYC for a quarter-century before moving Upstate, but neither my wife nor I have any problems walking around there after dark. However, don't stay in the summertime because the hotel's AC is set to \"as little as we can manage\", and room are often intolerably hot for my wife and I who likes things chilly on hot days.

As my company was paying it was an acceptable place to stay, but if I had been paying myself I would have wanted a much better rate, especially as the vast majority of other guests seemed to be either backpackers or families on package rates. I guess the trick is to book well in advance. I have nothing to complain about, but nothing to rave about either. The one outstanding aspect was one of the check-in staff. A colleague was also staying here, for one night only, and had mistakenly been booked into a smoking room. At check-in the member of staff did all she could to resolve this, given there were no non-smoking rooms available and came up with a good solution that fixed the problem.

There's an attractive bar at the far end, high ceilings, elegant front desk, etc. And with most NYC hotels, once you get to your room, you are let down by the cramped quarters. We spent 4 nights there (myself, wife, 23 year old son & 18 year old daughter). THANK GOODNESS the room was a decent size. It actually felt mostly like a room you'd find in the midwest somewhere. Two decent sized beds and some actual room to walk around the room. A couple of small sitting areas. A cabinet with a TV. All very bland and typical...but for traveling in NYC ON A BUDGET, it was surprisingly good sized. The bathroom, on the other hand, was quite small...thank goodness the sink was on the outside, because even taking the toilet/shower space combined with the sink space...two people together would have been quite tight. Closet space (for hanging items) was okay but not super generous. I think if you were spending longer than 4 or 5 nights, you'd get a bit tired of the lack of space. We were okay overall. The hotel was not terribly noisy (we were all the way up on the 2nd floor!! That's what we get for getting a low price on Travelocity, I guess), and I think we all slept pretty well. The pillows were fine (and marked as \"soft\" & \"firm\", in case you couldn't tell for yourself). Service was fine. The concierge was very friendly and helpful. We did not avail ourselves of the food or beverage service at all. Truthfully, the biggest drawback of this modest hotel was the location. It's not terrible, but it's not great either. You're about two long blocks from the nearest subway station...although it's the station at Columbus Circle, and that has just about every line running through it. And this two block walk is not terribly interesting. It's not a bad neighborhood, but you're mostly walking by Walgreens, CVC and pet supply stores...no glamour at all! You're a longish walk to Times Square, so if that's your bag (we saw several shows) you're more than likely going to take a cab or subway most fo the time. The southwestern entrance to Cental Park is a bit closer though, so if you're planning considerable time in the Park, this is a good spot. I assume the reason we got a reasonable rate WAS the location. As I looked for hotels just a little closer to the \"action\", rates went up a good 20% from what we paid...so I was okay with the inconvience. In summation, staying at the Holiday Inn won't be the high point of your visit to NYC...but if you're coming there for the hotel, you've got the wrong priorities!

One room was for my brother (age 59), the other for me (67) and my adult daughter. We were in town to see my grandson perform at Lincoln Center with his college symphony that Saturday night. Originally, we had reservations to stay at the Park Central Hotel where grandson and his group were staying. But I found a really good rate at the HI at the last-minute so we changed. And boy were we glad we did! Even though these were queen smoking rooms (18th floor) and we don't smoke, there was no detectable smoke odor in either room. We were willing to put a few deodorizers around for the rate we got, but were thrilled we didn't need to do this. The other hotel looked like spring break at Daytona - the lobby was overflowing with teenage groups and I can only imagine the noise with all of them roaming the hallways at night. We loved the HI, the front desk people were always friendly, we never had to wait in line either for check-in or check-out. Loved that one of our rooms was ready when we got there at 10:30 AM. This allowed us to deposit all our luggage there and head out sightseeing. After nearly killing our legs between walking around town and the subway steps on day 1, we got a bus map/schedule from the concierge the 2nd day and really liked utilizing the buses. The north/south line ran downtown on 9th, uptown on 10th, so we just walked to or from either corner for these and never waited longer than 5 minutes. The cross-town (57th St.) bus was right there also and we used this a LOT! This really saved our legs. Our rooms were a good size, esp. for NYC, and we liked that we could open the windows. Both of our rooms had good views, with my brother's view really spectacular as he was on the rear of the building and had the whole skyline to view plus the Hudson River off to the side. The views were such a nice, unexpected bonus. The bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. The bathroom was pretty small, but everything was clean and our rooms were made up promptly. Decor looks like any standard motel room, but as we were only in it to clean up and sleep, we were happy with it. The morning we checked out, we were able to use a dedicated computer at the end of the counter to print our boarding passes (for free), which was a great convenience. We also were able to store our luggage for the day at no charge, although we did tip when we picked it up. We had planned to get a taxi back to LaGuardia, but the hotel attendant asked if we wanted a towncar for a flat rate of $40, incl. tolls and tip. Since it had cost us $45 in a taxi to get there, we jumped on this offer. The \"limo\" was waiting for us when we got outside, and as the traffic was horrendous on that late Sunday afternoon, it took us close to an hour to get there. We were so glad we weren't on the meter! They said we could have had the same service for our arrival - wish I'd have known that, as the car was large and comfortable. We had breakfast one AM across the street at the Morningstar Cafe, a little place where the locals come and the food and service were first-rate. Ate dinner one night on 57th btwn 8th and 9th at Reynolds Pub and highly recommend for nice atmosphere, good food and fair prices. I had a huge sirloin burger (delicious) with fries for $10.95 and couldn't even finish it all. There's a Walgreen's across the street and a nice little wine shop just down the block, btwn 8th/9th, that had some really great prices. The guy even opened our bottle for us, as we didn't have a corkscrew in our room. All of us said that if we ever get back to NYC we'd stay at this Holiday Inn again. Not the Ritz, but more than met our expectations and needs.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cGood Location and Okay Stay\u201d", "Author": "Canuckboy44", "ReviewID": "UR104434357", "Content": "My sister and I stayed here from Nov 29-Dec 4th, 2010.

The next day was our checkout and they extended it to 3 p.m. I talked to the third manager regarding this situation and her name is Janet.

We had a coffeemaker in our room, always a plus....also had free wi-fi. The hotel restaurant, Gotham Cafe, was a bit over-priced for average food......I was charged $5 for a small glass of cranberry juice.

It also helps to know that this hotel is frequented by tour groups, especially from Eastern Europe, and this will give you an idea of the overall standard to expect. Rooms Quite large for NYC, and are what you would expect - serviceable, with private facilities - but showing their age. Additionally, as mentioned by previous reviewers, the air conditioning is very loud, and in my room, condensation from the air con was so extreme that it saturated the nearby carpet on a daily basis. To their credit, the staff were concerned, and tried to fix the problem, but unfortunately to no avail. Also note that there are no safes in the room, and only a limited number of safety deposit boxes at reception \u2013 there was nothing available on any day of my 9 day stay, so I had to carry around all my valuables whilst sightseeing (not ideal). It was also inconvenient when I used the hotel pool, as I had to take my valuables poolside and keep a constant look out when swimming. As mentioned by other reviewers, there are ice machines in the hotel, but not on every floor, and if you are unlucky enough to have one outside your room (as I was !) you\u2019ll get noise all night long - not only of the very loud ice maker itself, but also from the slamming of the fire stairs doors as people go up and down to use the machines. Be warned ! That said, there are two big bonuses with this hotel: 1 - location 2 \u2013 rooftop pool Location in midtown Manhattan is within easy walking distance to Central Park South / Columbus Circle, 5th Avenue, and several subway lines. Additionally, the street outside the hotel is reasonably quiet for central Manhattan, and there are numerous eating places close by (Broadway / Times Square is about 10 minute\u2019s walk south of the hotel). Very convenient location. The other plus with this hotel is the rooftop pool, and it\u2019s a real treat to be up there swimming with a view of the skyline, but be warned that it does get very crowded, and it can be difficult to find somewhere to sit, let alone find a reclining lounge chair. The other negative is that, bizarrely, the hotel closed the pool every day at 6.00pm, which is just when you want to use it the most, after a hot day of sightseeing !!! All in all, I can\u2019t say that this hotel is great value for money, but you are going to pay through the nose for any half decent hotel in Manhattan (especially in Midtown) and the hotel itself is quite serviceable, just set your expectations to that of a typical Holiday Inn \u2013 don\u2019t expect too much, and that\u2019s just what you get !", "Date": "October 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Good Views, Easy Stay\u201d", "Author": "zeefla", "ReviewID": "UR82589922", "Content": "Room was big enough for the two of us, we had a nice view of the city from our window and the bed was really comfortable.

Booked with Priceline but only saved about $20/night. Selected this hotel because I wanted to be within walking distance of the theater district as well as the meeting place for the Sex and the City (near the Plaza Hotel) and only needed a place to shower, dress and rest my head. For my purposes this hotel worked very well. We bussed into Port Authority and took a cab to the hotel - only cost $4 plus tip and very quick trip. Initially they were going to put us in a smoking room stating that since we booked with a 3rd party we would get what was left and the hotel was pretty full. When I explained that I didn't want my pregnant daughter to be in a smoking room they immediately responded and found us a non-smoking one. When we got to our room we found the air conditioning turned all the way up but the room was warm. On our way out to the theater we stopped at the desk and complained about the air conditioning. After we retuned from the theater and were in our PJ's we noticed there was a message on our phone stating that they were unable to fix the air conditioning but they would be willing to change our room. Since we were ready for bed we stayed where we were and they changed our room the next day. The second room was better but still not as cool as it should have been with the air conditioner on max. On our way to the theater the next night we asked the concierge for a suggestion for somewhere to go for appetizers and drinks prior to our show. He sent us to the Glass House, 2 streets over from the theater. It has a modern upscale look and both drinks and appetizers were good. Like the fact that he said \" Here's where I'll send you\" rather than giving us a list of places to have to think about. On the way out, the bus boy in the lobby was very helpful with our bags. .This hotel was adequate for our needs, having all the basics as well as comfortable beds. It's not fancy and has areas that are being renovated but nothing major. No refrigerator in the room and an ice machine is not on every floor (had to go one floor down).

No safe in the room though, turns out that;s quite important at this hotel. The only major gripe i really had with the hotel was that on the last day of my stay, things went missing from my room, a brand new pair of Nike shoes & various electrical items from the bathroom (shaver, toothbrush, nose hair trimmer, etc.) now the mentality of someone who wants a second hand electric toothbrush or nose hair trimmer escapes me, but nonetheless I was not happy. Very glad I had taken my laptop out with me and my digital SLR too & that I never leave my passport in my room. I went downstairs to the lobby and went to reception to report the theft, they seemed completely uninterested and sent me over to a chap at another desk whom they said was security. This seemed to be the guy responsible for keeping the riff raff out at night, and had the air of a nightclub bouncer. I told him what happened, he seemed incredulous that anyone would want to steal things from my room and asked if I was sure I hadn't just misplaced them, and said he couldn't really do anything about it until his boss came back, that night 12 hours later. He also incredulously claimed that housekeeping may have thought I was leaving a day early and thus threw all my possessions away. The way he said this seems like he may have told people that before and had them buy it, he actually said, \"you didn't leave your new shoes anywhere near the bin did you? as they might have thought you wanted to throw them out.\" I informed him I did not, that they were in a new Nike box and as I was leaving in 4 hours there was not really a lot I could do as he seemed quite unwilling to help. All of the things he said seemed like tried and tested ways to get out of actually doing anything about the theft. He gave me a telephone number to call and check what the status was and see about compensation, or finding out who entered the room (all electronic key locks should have a list of people who have entered available) I called back on the evening I was asked to (stayed up until 4am UK time to be able to) and was told that the head of security was out and couldn't speak to me. 6 further calls at various times when I was told he would be available, to the number given, reception and finally messages on his voice-mail all went unreturned. I am not impressed at all with the way I was treated by the Holiday Inn staff, and would never stay with them again.

To be honest though, New York is such a busy place and if, like most people you are there for a few days (or 6 days like us) then the hotel is just a base, rather than somewhere you spend very much time in.

We didn't eat in the restaurant as there are plenty of places to eat. We used the Brooklyn Diner just down the road, and often went to the kiosk just inside Central Park and brought coffee and croissants from there and ate 'Al Fresco'. We stayed in the North Tower of the hotel and we noticed that in the South Tower, decorating work was deing done an it generally looked a bit 'worn' . There were notices apologising for the work in progress though. I would definitely recommend to friends. If you are looking for top class luxuxy, this is not a luxury hotel, but we found it to be clean, comfy and the staff were very welcoming. As for noise from other guests - we were so tired at the end of each day, that we were not disturbed by any door banging as we fell straight off to sleep!", "Date": "September 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFair price and good location\u201d", "Author": "Dave4422", "ReviewID": "UR79156119", "Content": "I stayed with three friends for two night at the Holiday Inn.

I asked if there could be a switch to a non-smoking room and was RUDELY told by the manager and front desk clerk that it would not be possible. There were no non-smoking rooms available. In addition, I would need to wait for a smoking room to be become available. I come back two hours later to check in. A really nice guy helped me this time and offered me a non-smoking room right away. I was very gracious for this. When I arrived, the room was in a rough condition. There was writing on the wall, the mirrors were dirty and the bathroom was DISGUSTING!!! The bathroom smelled like pee, there was grime everywhere and I believe there were urine stains in the corner. I would compare it to a public restroom. It was that bad. The room was configured so that the sink/mirror were outside of the actual bathroom. There were towels hanging and I noticed one of them had blood stains (looked fairly fresh on them). I was so disgusted. I think the one good thing about this place is the room size.

I apologize in advance if I offend anybody, but based on personal experience I have to say that Europeans are not as picky about their hotel accomodations as Americans. After several conversations with the manager, they did comp us are parking, but if wasn't much of a discount. It was actually cheaper to book directly through the Holiday Inn than it was through Hotwire so she essentially gave us their deal. I wouldn't not recommend this hotel to anyone on a family vacation.

For the price my employer paid, I could have gotten a much better hotel in a better location, but the conference I was attending was at the hotel. The decor is a hodge podge of partially renovated areas and areas that were last updated circa 1980. The photos on the Holiday Inn web site don't lie. That is actually what the hotel looks like inside. At the risk of sounding like a snob, I personally have not seen anything like that since I was a little girl in the 1980s. Most hotel brands, even budget ones, have insisted on consistency and providing a clean, basic place to stay. This was the exception. The lobby bar had been renovated, but the rest of the lobby had not. The lobby had a weird smell like an overpowering air freshener. Stafff...The staff was OK. Check in was easy but the lady did not tell me to go to the back set of elevators, so I went to the wrong elevator bank and consequently my room was not where I would have thought and I had to come back down the elevator. Check out was easy. Bellstaff was so-so. One man helped me check my bag, but no one opened the door, and one man had to get off his cell phone to help me get a cab and assist other guests. As the bellman who did help me pointed out, most of the staff is lazy and just stands around talking. They did a good job of setting up the conference though the projector was not working at first and they actually got one of the cafe employees to try to fix it. Some staff members, particularl housekeeping, were friendly and I do want to give them credit. Cleanliness and upkeep -- The hotel was gross. The women's restroom, though tastefully redone, was a disaster. None of the soap dispensers worked, the garbage had not been emptied so there were paper towels all over the floor, and water was all over the basins and floor. And one of the toilets was not flushing. Rather than clean it up, someone just put out a \"Caution - Slippery Floor\" sign. When I arrived at my room, there was a room service tray out front. I was almost scared someone would still be in my room when I opened the door! The tray and accompanying food were not removed until mid-morning the next day. The door to the supply closet on the floor was left wide open, as the latch didn't work, and vacuums were left in the hallway the entire time. The room itself was comfortable enough and of a decent size. It had an old tube TV. The TV got bad reception, made a static noise, and had gray lines running through it. There were toiletries -- several bars of soap and some Bath and Body Works products. There was a coffee maker but no mini-fridge. There were soda machines and ice machines. The safe did not work. The bed was comfortable. Water pressure was good as was temperature. The a/c worked and was a noisy window unit. The room was horrifically outdated and dingy. The worst thing was an enormous (3-4') bubble on the ceiling where there must have been a leak. The paint was chipping and the ceiling was brown in spots. It needed to be taken down and replaced. Instead, it had just been painted over. It looked like it might cave in. There was also a rather large hole (about 2' wide) in one of the ceilings in the hallway. The location was OK. The neighborhood is residential but it's within 3 blocks of Columbus Circle. All in all, for the price paid, I could have stayed in a 4-star hotel.

The hotel overall is in desperate need of a facelift however I expect that is why the rates are a little lower than others in the neighborhood. The worst part was being there during a heat wave with little or basically no air conditioning. It blows slightly but does not cool off the room or remove any of the humidity. Everything in the room was sticky and the ice melted in a matter of minutes due to the heat. We were attending a convention at the Sheraton and missed the convention rate deadline so we stayed here; also smoking rooms are getting harder to find and I quite honestly get tired of standing on the street corner in major cities when I want to have a cigarette so we booked at the Holiday Inn. Upon arrival I checked in which took a while as there was only one person behind the desk and a line of people. The lobby was very hot and stuffy. After checking in I noted they had booked me in a non smoking room. I went back down to the lobby; waited in line again. The only answer I received was yes you did reserve a smoking room but we are sold out of them right now. Just that nothing else. No apologies; just non smoking is all we have right now. They said they would t have a smoking room the next day b y 11:00. This room was a king and as I stated earlier a good size however the air conditioning was not working so I requested a fan; set it on the AC unit in hopes that it would help. It did not. The internet is so slow it\u2019s not worth the effort so I had to use my air card. The next morning we went down for the new room however none were cleaned. We were given a free drink coupon but were not in the mood to for alcohol that early in the day so we set in the hot and stuffy lobby and waited. Finally at 1:00 we were told our room should be ready soon; we elected to go back to our room and wait. And waited we did until about 3:00 PM. We packed up all our stuff and moved to the new room however they had given up a queen instead of the promised double. We went back to the front desk and they gave us two more coupons and the correct room however by this time we had lost a good portion of day and were unable to do some of the things we planned. The AC was no better in this room as well. I didn\u2019t mind the small bathrooms, the peeling wallpaper and outdated d\u00e9cor however limited AC during a heat wave was miserable.

The room was kind of old, needing new wallpaper and carpet (not a disaster, mind you, but I think it's about time they change it before it gets bad). The rate did not include breakfast, so I chose to eat out in a restaurant half block from there (The Morning Star, I'll review it soon, but recommend it if you're staying here).

We were approximately 2 blocks from Columbus Circle, Central Park and and the subway stop. We were happy with our maid service: our room was tidied up every day when we came back from our travels. The rooftop pool is quite nice and has beverage service and a large deck for sun tanning. Unfortunately, the pool hours do not make sense: what is the point of closing a pool at 6 pm on a hot summer night? Isn't the idea to offer a place for travelers (and their kids) to chill out after a day on the town? Even though we love swimming - we only made it back to the hotel in time for a dip twice. The lobby of the hotel was always buzzing with tourists and staff. Not the type of place you would want to lounge. Instead, take your book or newspaper to a local cafe.

The area around the hotel is also very safe and we have no issues walking back to the hotel after midnight. But generally Manhatten is really safe for all visitors. I am not sure about Harlem though as i did not explore north of Central Park during my visit. There are a couple of convenience shops(Walgreens) around the hotel as well as restaurants for breakfast. Make sure to try out Morning Star Restaurant for breakfast on the way to Columbus Circle subway station. There is a guy in there who has a slight hunch who is really friendly who dishes out lots of tips and advice for visitors. The check-in guy Valdy is also pretty helpful and friendly.

I thought I would have a glass of Prosecco or Cava to sheer me up, but the bartender offered me a 1/4 bottle of Champagne instead and I thought why not? However what he gave me was undrinkable, certainly not Champagne (but it was 'made' by Johnny R Champagne) I sent it back ...bartender not happy..didn't offer me anything else. 20 min wait to talk to the concierge ..just to get a map ...the bell boys wouldn't get me one. She talked to me whilst drinking a bottle of water. The room was adequate but very tired, large by European standards but stains on carpets and armchair.

I did extensive research on line before our trip, trying to find a hotel that was not only reasonable, but was near everything we wanted to see. The location of this hotel is not too bad. If you come to NYC, you WILL be doing a lot of walking, and from this hotel, you'll be walking about 5-10 minutes to get to Central Park and about 15 minutes to Times Square. It wasnt bad at all for us. There is a nice little breakfast diner on the corner of 57th and 8th (?) (go out the front door of the hotel and turn right and you'll see it on the corner on the left side). We never ate in the hotel restaurant, so I cant comment on that. Now for the problem we had, and the reason we checked out a day early...the hotel does NOT have individual A/C units in each room. The entire building is either on air or heat, and the building apparently does not switch over to air until a date later than April. We were on the 7th floor and it was unbearably hot. We had the windows open, but then you have the issue of NY traffic noise. The staff at the hotel was incredibly nice and understanding of why we checked out a day early, but it is still a problem. Luckily, the rooms do have wi-fi, so I was able to get on the laptop and find another hotel (with air!) on 47th street (Hotel Edison). It was $20 more a night, and the rooms were a little smaller, and it was pain in the [--] to pack up and move all our stuff, but boy was it nice to have A/C for the last few days of our trip! A few other minor problems with our room...the TV never quite worked correctly. The remote would not work and you had to manually change the channels, some of which didnt come in clear. Also, there is really no place in the bathroom to place anything (shaving kit, brushes, makeup, etc). Minor problem, but again can be a pain when 3 people are sharing a bathroom. Once the A/C is turned on, I would recommend this hotel, simply for the location, the price, and the wonderful staff. One other NYC travel tip...DO take the hop on/hop off tour of the downtown loop.

Housekeeping changed towels and soap daily. Running hot water throughout and good shower. 3) Large room, could easily accommodate 2-3 people. King sized bed, with a good mattress and pillows. 4) Breakfast was covered by a $20 voucher, which was enough for 1 person - 2 people could probably eat for that. Selection of healthy and non=healthy food (mostly unhealthy though) 5) Free wireless internet. 6) Mostly friendly and helpful staff. 7) Free gym though a little small but good selection of equipment and friendly staff. (swimming pool shut due to season) Minor Issues: 1) The furnishings are a little old but not so much to cause discomfort e.g. TV in my room was not a flat screen. 2) Dinner in hotel's cafe/restaurant was overpriced and food wasnt that great but plenty of restuarants/fast food/supermarkets and delis within walking distance to ensure large affordable variety. 3) Noise could be an issue for some people e.g. slamming doors in the middle of the night but its to be expected. 4) One of Cafe staff/waiters was a little unprofessional but all others were friendly and efficient.

As other reviews have highlighted, the decor is faded and a little tired, but at this price in Manhattan I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as long as you're not looking for luxury - and if you are then pay the (significant) extra $$$'s so you won't be disappointed. On reading some reviews it seems to me that some are expecting more than what they paid for - it's a Holiday Inn at a discount price after all. In our experience, even with young kids, you'll be out exploring NYC most of your time and the hotel is for crashing in at the end of a tiring day. We did not use the restaurant at all during our stay, so I cannot comment on the service or the food. There are too many options for eating out in this city so staying in a hotel to eat did not appeal to us. The location has to be the best thing about staying in this hotel, we loved the fact that we could walk to Columbus Circle subway station in a few minutes and hop on to get anywhere in the city. Central Park is also within a short walking distance, and the Times Square and Theatre District is only a 10-15 min walk away. There are also restaurants, pubs and diners nearby when you want to stay close. The neighbourhood is pleasant and safe and not too noisy. We were out with the kids after dark many times and did not feel at all threatened here. To sum things up, this is a good value hotel situated in a great location for tourists.

You can't argue that it represents good value and the rooms/bathrooms are more than adequate. However, it is greatly let down by the staff who treated us as if everything was too much trouble. We had booked 2 rooms for a family re-union each travelling from opposite ends of the world but in spite of booking some 4 months ago the hotel could not put us on the same floor. Caution to others: As we were travelling on flights from different parts of the world we arrived at significantly different times. As I had made the booking the hotel would not allow our family to check in until I arrived, in spite of them having a copy of the booking confirmation and the same surname. They were also charged for leaving their bags in the hotel until we arrived. On one occasion our room hadn't been serviced (OK, we accept anyone can make a mistake) so we went down and asked for some shampoo and coffee (one complimentary coffee is given each day), when this was finally brought to the room the person went off with the huff because we did not give a tip for something that should have been done anyway. Bell staff were also keen to push guests into unofficial overpriced \"taxis\" as opposed to the cheaper yellow cabs. Throughout our stay we never got a hullo or a good morning and we were given to feel that guests, far from being paying customers were just a nuisance. We did however like having a coffee machine in our room and an ice machine in the corridor. From here we moved on to Holiday Inn By the Falls in Niagara in Canada, where the difference in attitude of the helpful staff was like a breath of fresh air. Visitor's tip (and New York runs on the other sort of tip so this is the only one you\u2019ll get for free): If you stay here, try the Morning Star Restaurant for breakfast (turn right when you come out of the hotel, cross the road and it's on the corner), it's good value and the staff are all very helpful with suggestions and ideas on where to visit (it's a shame they did not work in the hotel!

No effort was made to present towels etc in an aesthetically pleasing way. When we arrived these things were just strewn over the bath rail as if staff did not care. Other hotels pay attention to these sorts of details and are standard for rooms of a similar price. Perhaps for $300 a night that's what you get in NYC ? I will say though the concierge team were helpful and the housekeeping staff were pleasant as well . However, the porters did not acknowledge us or offer to help in any way the entire week. In fact they were more interested in leaning on their desk and talking amongst themselves. No attempt was made to help us with our luggage when we arrived. On our second day we ventured up to the pool area and were greeted by what I think were pool hands who looked like they had been dragged off the street. ( they were not wearing uniforms and could not be identified by name tags which in itself is a worry as they could have been up there to rob or harass guests) They made no attempt to acknowledge us our offer us assistance and were clearly hostile young men. We ended up leaving the pool as we felt unsafe and unwelcome . Again, in this context one would think front of house staff would at the very least smile rather than grimace at guests. Finally, while the condition of the hotel is not totally offensive it is rather tired. The porters and pool staff made me feel so uncomfortable I would not stay there again.

Very safe and close to the subway and points of interest like Central Park. Housekeeping was very friendly and always greeted us with a smile. The room was spacious (we were in tower B). We didn't have time to use the gym but it is very well equipped (privately owned) but free for guests. Head east to the end of the block and you'll find a fantastic diner called Morning Star Restaurant. Family owned so the service was \"New York\" charming (and I mean that in a very good way). Not much to see from the outside...not much from the inside but the food was perfect and the service very very friendly. I regret not remembering the two waiters names but they are really good guys. So friendly and helpful, feel free to ask them for any advice, directions or suggestions on what to do. This price was also very reasonable unlike many other flashy diners. The bed was very comfortable and the a/c worked well although despite being a little bit noisy. Now the bad: For us, customer service is very VERY important. The parking guys were okay but I was not impressed with them leaning on our car as we unloaded our bags ourselves (bell hops were no where to be seen). I guess they really didn't care since they don't work for the hotel but for a contracted parking company called Apex. On a brighter note the cost of valet parking was reasonable ($25/day) and we did get our car back quickly without any noticable scratches. We interacted with 3 different front desk people on 3 different occasions and each clerk we spoke to never offered a smile or anything that resembled warmth....in fact one of them actually stopped smiling as I approached them. They did their jobs but honestly, how hard is it to be just a little friendly? HELLO!! You are in the HOSPITALITY business! A small fridge will cost you $10/day. I discovered this when I called to request one but decided to think about it. The next day I decided to invest in the convenience of a fridge since the ice machine was not on my floor (the one above was broken but the one on the floor below was barely working). This time they inform me it would cost me $25/day. I attempted to clarify why it was $10 yesterday and today it was $25...they respond \"we are sending one up now\". \"Well how much will it cost\" I reply, to which they respond \"complimentary\". I still don't know what exactly happened there but this is one of those times when 2 wrongs actually do make a right... The wifi at this hotel is very VERY slow and inconsistent. There isn't a wired option and sometimes it would give you a message that too many users are connected! The bathroom....NO counter space and an interesting stench...a body order / urinal like bouquet greeted the nose upon entering the room. The entire hotel also had a unique aroma...old cigarette smoke complimented with cheap air freshener with a delicate touch of must.

The brand pretty much determines it will not be a luxury facility, and as is typical of the brand, it is a popular destination for foreign tourists, so if that bothers you I wouldn't stay here. Overall though I was expecting much worse for the price. We stayed a Sunday and Monday night and paid about $128/night plus tax, which seemed pretty reasonable for the location and time of year.", "Date": "August 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "st louis", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "karenpStLouis", "ReviewID": "UR37509517", "Content": "We stayed here for 2 nights.

We had reserved a NON SMOKING room w/2 double beds and had confirmation of that. However, we were put into a NASTY smoking room, where when you got off the elevator, you almost got sick off the smell. Our youngest son cried for about an hour because of the smell...not a great start. I ended up sleeping 3 hours and went to the lobby to try to rest. In the morning, I went to see about getting moved to a NON-SMOKING room and I was told there weren't any available even though the night clerks had told us we could move in the morning. After I was forceful and told them that they needed to find us a non-smoking room OR find us another hotel at the same rate we were paying, they magically found us a room. Once the manager arrived, I spoke with her about my conversation at check in and that I wanted the room fee waived for that night. She had the audacity to say, \"You were happy with a 20% discount last night. when you checked in.\" I told her that we didn't really have much of a choice since there was no manager on staff when we arrived and with it being 1 o'clock in the morning and because we were traveling with children, we just needed shelter. She ended up giving us 50% off for that one night and free breakfast in the hotel restaurant (nothing special). The rest of the stay was pretty much what other people have posted. Not an exceptionally friendly staff. Nothing special about the hotel. But, a very good price for where you are staying in a chain where you know what the hotels are like. With our AAA card, we got a rate under $140/night... that's pretty unheard of for the area for a family of 4. I would only recommend the hotel if you get a rate you can't beat in a hotel where you feel like you'll be safe and it's relatively clean.

I noticed right away that a small side wondow was open. I prompltly closed it. this also lead to my discovery of the room darkening shade. Previous experieence has taught me that they can block out rays that can keep the room hot. Mine stayed shut for my entire six day stay. However, I noticed several open windows across the way in the south tower. Perhaps someone from the staff should go close those to keep the air in. This is not to say that the room temp is solely up to the guest. Holiday Inn management needs to look at shortening the floor length drapes to sill length. This will allow the drapes to close completely without blocking the AC. The drapes were flocked with an insulating maerial so the heat should be reflected outside, keeping the cool air in. Antoher issue I fretted about was smoke scented rooms. I brought along a bottle of Febreze. I thankfully did not have to use it. Yet, I have no doubt managment would have graciously honored my request to move if it had been necessary. And about the staff...they are efficient but they are not your best friend.

The bad: First off, floors 3-18 had no water for about 30 hours. This meant that if you went to the restroom before you realized there was no water that there was no way to flush the human waste down the toilet without water pressure. Second issue, guests would discard food trays outside of their rooms in the hallways. These trays would have discarded food on them. The trays would be in the hallways for days at a time. There were two on our floor alone, and one of them we had to walk by every time. Third issue, after walking by the same discarded tray of rotting food for over 48 hours, the smell started getting to my pregnant wife. So I picked up the tray and took it to the front desk so they could do something with it. I explained to the lady that the tray wasn't mine, and had been sitting in the hall by the elevator for over two days and that the food was starting to rot. Instead of apologizing, the woman at the front desk (where people check in) said, \"Why would you bring this to the front desk? What do you want me to do with this? (censored inflammatory religious reference) What nerve!\" Also, when the hotel floors 3-18 lost water, AC, and the ability to evacuate human waste from guest room toilets for about 30 hours most of the staff was rude and deceptive about the reason why and the amount of time to restoration. The staff refused to relocate me and my pregnant wife from the 12th floor to another hotel, and said that I was free to do so at my own expense. However, at the end of the trip they did refund me 50% (of one day) for the 30 hours we were without water, which is a satisfactory solution to me. The hotel also has a noise issue with doors. All of the doors slam so hard that they woke me and my wife up each time someone on our half of the floor entered or exited their room and allowed the door to naturally shut. Pool hours for the hotel were 10am to 6pm. You'd think they would be from maybe noon to midnight. My wife and I weren't able to make use of the pool because of the 6pm closing time. The elevators are slow and crowded as well and sometimes don't always function right. The good: If it wasn't for the horrible handling of the food tray situation and lack of water issue I would have had a very enjoyable stay! The best part of this hotel is the location. There are a LARGE amount of subway lines at the \"Columbus Circle\" station and you can actually access them from an underground tunnel that's at 57th Street and 8th Avenue (great if it's raining). You can quickly and easily use the subways to go anywhere, including Citi Field, The Brox Zoo, New Yankee Stadium, Anywhere in Manhattan. Also, you're within short walking distance of Times Square, the Broadway theatres, Restaurant Row, and beautiful Central Park. Although we received generally bad service, there was one very nice young gentleman that manned the front desk at night, he was a gem. The rooms aren't huge, but they aren't small either. The bathrooms are a little small and ours was showing ware, but nothing that was too bad. After all, it's a Holiday Inn, you're not there for a swanky bathroom. The TV's are alright and have lots of local and national channels to keep you entertained. While I had a few negatives listed about the pool above, it actually is a nice facility (just with bad hours). The rooftop pool, located on top the of south tower (perhaps above the 10th or 11th floor) has a great view of Manhattan and New Jersey. The pool facility is well maintained. The room cleaning staff, while they didn't fluently speak English, were very polite and did a great job of cleaning and replenishing the rooms with towels. The lady that took care of the 12th floor noticed we had the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign because we didn't want room service each day and offered us towels when we came back to our room, which was very courteous and high-level of her. Also, the wireless Internet, while not blazing fast, was more than sufficient and much better than other hotels out there.

She promised that we could change the room next day if we like. They never delivered roll-over bed to our room. I had to go to reception again since after long flight we wanted to go to sleep. When \"brand-new\" roll-over bed came, it was horrible. Dirty, lousy mattress and too short to sleep properly. The result: our teenager did not sleep and had problems with his back. Next morning I had to go reception twice in order to get the room changed to one that was promised to us. We did not get any help with the luggages but need to carry everything by ourselves.

The rooms were cleaned everyday to a good standard, but no one seemed to notice the mold in the bathroom! We used our vouchers for breakfast, and had some extras sometimes from the menu. Prices for breakfast did seem reasonable and were quick. The best thing about this hotel is its location! You could be in times square in about 15mins by walking. Did this most days - day and night - and felt quite safe. On the last day we were advised that we could actually use the breakfast vouchers we were given against the menu and minus $5 off the bill (which the reception conviently forgot to tell us). However this caused more problems than not, as when it came to the bill on check out we were still charged the full amount. The reception seemed to not care and couldnt be bothered to help and resolve the problem. So after realising it was like talking to a brick wall, we paid and left in a huff!

The hotel is a little old and the rooms are a little outdated but for the price and location, can't really get a better deal in Manhattan. The hotel is located only a few blocks away from Central Park. It's about a 5 minute walk. Subway access is only a few blocks away too. The bed was comfortable and the floors were clean. However, there was some dust here and there. I really didn't mind the dust. Everything was fine with this hotel except for one thing. Maybe this is not a big thing for some people but for me, it was a bit of a nuisance. I guess its due to the old pipes or something but the water coming out of the bathroom sink and bathtub was a bit white (kind of looked like salt water). It wasn't crystal clear like you would get in your home. That was my only complaint about my stay at this hotel. Staff were friendly and polite.

Staff services were standard, as expected in any budget hotel chain. The rooms were situated on two different wings \u2013 one has all the odd-number rooms, and the other has the even numbers. We were not told which wing our room was on, so we got to find that out ourselves\u2026 We stayed in the standard suite in the \u201ceven-numbered\u201d wing, and were amazed at the spaciousness of the room, given how small rooms can be in Manhattan. The room was very clean and odour-free, with king-size bed, TV, fridge, coffee-making facilities, and a standard bathroom include all the basics. It was a little strange having the wash basin and mirror outside the bathroom, and the ironing board in the bathroom where the toilet and the bath tub are. Location is between 9th and 10th Avenue, and if you are willing to do a little walking, then the shopping world at 5th Avenue is no more than 20 minutes away. There is not much of a nightlife in the surrounds, but Time Square is not too far away \u2013 about 15 or so blocks away (each block is not very big, so don\u2019t be afraid!). There are some eateries if you keep walking towards the 9th, 8th avenues, but there is a Starbuck nearby if you need a quick feed. Duane Reade (a 24-hour convenience store) is also nearby if you need any essentials. Breakfast is available on the ground floor. The food was reasonably priced from $8 to about $15! Food was fine, with standard offerings. The food tasted a bit bland, but the fresh orange juice was very nice! Overall our stay in the Holiday Inn at 57th St was fairly standard \u2013 pleasant and expected.

Hence, we missed going inside. We found New York people to be generally unhelpful, uncaring (unless a tip was at stake) and pushy. The restaurant & room service at the hotel add on an automatic tip of 15% to all bills, taking away our right to choose how much we think the service deserves. There are plenty of cheap take out places and corner markets to buy food & supplies. We would recommend any other time to visit NY other than winter. As much as the city is beautiful with the Christmas lights, the cold, the crowds and the general attitude of the locals was hard to deal with.

On checking in we were given our room key on the 9th floor. The room itself was opposite the lift and on entering smelled damp, but worse than that were the suitcases and belongings in the room. Our room was already occupied! Luckily we are honest people and returned straight to reception rather than have a nose through other people's belongings! However the receptionist could not understand our disbelief at their error. She kept saying \"It's not my fault\" and was quite indignant rather than apologetic. I said that I hoped she would not hand out our keys to new arrivals, to which she again replied \"it's not my fault\" although after checking her computer finally said \"aah it was my fault\" although it was still not accompanied by any apology for the mix up! When we finally got into an unoccupied room it was basic and seemed clean. Luckily we had brought earplugs as whilst on the 8th floor was still noisy and located near the lift. Sound proofing is not a strong point of the hotel. The room itself was chilly and we discovered our heating was not working however the hotel sent an engineer immediately to fix and once on the heat meant we were no longer freezing. Our one and only experience of the hotel bar was using the free vouchers given to us by reception as an apology for the room mix up on check in however the surly girl behind the bar did not exactly make us want to stay and have a second drink or leave any tip as she was really quite rude. This was confirmed when a second customer arrived and queried something with her about a previous drink to which she responded that it was clearly shown on his bill. He then replied it would have been fine had she actually presented him with a bill. All in all it was a soul less bar area, chilly and unfriendly. Finally when we checked out which was early AM my friend screamed as a cockroach ran around the sink area. We assume it had been running over our toothbrushes on previous occasions which was a thought we would rather not dwell on. I reported it to the lovely (not) receptionist on checking out only to be informed \"madame this is New York, all big cities have cockroaches\". Hhmmm yes I appreciate that but where was the customer service during this whole stay. Had I paid some of the rates quoted on this site for this hotel I would have felt very hard done by, as it was we paid minimal rates as we booked a package so probably about \u00a350 pppn. My advice would be if you are paying any more than this research other hotels even smaller boutique hotels where they actually care about the customer and wish them to return. Yes, the location was reasonable however cabs are so cheap you can get where you want at minimal cost. Personally when I return in March I would not stay here at any cost!

Let me start by saying that I am no expert on New York Hotels, this being my first visit. But I expected much more from a Holiday Inn, the previous week I had stayed in a Holiday Inn in San Francisco and the difference was chalk & cheese. However my sister was staying at the Novotel on 42nd? and said the rooms there were also below average, so maybe it's a NY thing. The room (16th floor) was very dated and smelled damp each time we entered. Also that awful Artex ceiling, which had damp patches. As a Platinum Priority Club member I was given vouchers for a complimentary continental breakfast, which mentioned Muffins, Bagels, Croissants etc. On the morning I tried it I was told by a waiter that I could have coffee, orange juice, and toast since they had nothing left. I never went back. Also tried the restaurant one night, which miraculously transforms from the breakfast room to an 'Italian Trattoria'. The only difference is the menu. It was a joke. The waiter clearly forgot to process our order and 45mins later presented us with toast, \"to keep us going\". Toast! My starter then arrived, then 30 secs later another waiter came out of the kitchen with our mains, spotted that I had just started my starter and did a U-turn back into the kitchen. No doubt our meals were kept under a hot-lamp for the next 10mins. I had no problem with the staff, other than the waiters. The bar and reception area's are fine. Was given a late 2pm check-out which was helpful, and the bell-boy arranged a car to JFK ($60). Safety deposit boxes are available at reception (no safe in room), these are free but you pay $100 if you lose the key.

The bathroom was ok except for a very old shower curtain and MOLD on the ceiling. Black mold all over the ceiling. Gross! The bottom line is, it's hard to stay in a room like that and feel comfortable. You feel grossed out because everything is dirty and worn and you feel unclean even after you bathe and you can't sleep comfortably.

The bathroom was small consisting of the toilet and shower only. Excellent shower pressure and HOT water. The vanity was seperate off the main room, which I love. I was thrilled with the space. The only other amenitiy we used was the rooftop pool for a couple hours. It too was surprisingly great. Very clean! They have one side of the roof for the pool and lounge chairs only. The other side has tables for eating and more lounge chairs. Very nice. Our only complaint was the noise we heard from the other rooms. The rooms don't seem sound proof at all.

We had booked a 10 night stay in the hotel for 3 people sharing a 2 double bedroom. I had selected the hotel having read some comments from reveiws on Trip Advisor.

Upon arrival the reception staff were business like but not over-helpful or friendly. - Although if you ask clearly for a particular facility or request we found it was always met. The corridors and rooms were generally tired looking and in need of refurbishment. The rooms were clean and of a good size. The bathroom was clean and the shower worked effectively with plenty of hot water always available. We had 2 double beds in the room and the air conditioning system worked effectively throughout our stay. I had requested prior to our arrival a non-smoking room facing the rear of the hotel on the 9th floor or above. I was told that our request could not be gauranteed but we got exactly what had been requested. We had no disturbance from the noise during our stay. The longer we were there the more we appriciated our choice of hotel, which we basically used as a place to sleep and nothing more. There was no safe in the room, but a safe deposit box was provided free of charge at the reception. The staff also arranged our transport back to the airport at the end of our stay and this worked pefectly. We requested a late departure on our final day leaving the room at 6.00pm. We paid an extra $99 + tax, and this also worked out perfectly. We did not eat in the hotel, but did use the bar and the swimming pool on the roof. The pool was a real bonus, but this closes at 6.00pm each day. I would stay here again as we found the staff to be helpful when any request was made. There are also a number of very good restaurants and breakfast diners on 9th Avenue. The subway is only a 5 minute walk away and we covered the whole of New York by using the 7day sub-way pass at $24 - this must be one of the bargins of the year.

She told us that we could not be assigned another room, because we already had one, and there was nothing actually broken or wrong with the room to warrant a change. I understand if the hotel is fully booked however she was quite rude in the manner of dealing with our request, which annoyed me the most. Cleanliness was not great - we left our room at 8.15am one morning and I noticed some breakfast dishes in the hallway outside one of the rooms...no big deal except that the exact same dishes and leftover food were still sitting there when we returned at 5pm that day!

It is right on the edge of the Hells Kitchen area and the walk down 9th Avenue towards Times Square passes loads of bars, restaurants and cafes that have a good local vibe and feel to them.

The hotel clearly does not train their employees on the value of good customer service. When we checked in, the front desk clerk looked up our reservation and said we had booked a smoking room with two double beds. My friend that booked the room, who is clearly pregnant, said no, I booked a NON smoking room with two double beds. The clerk proceeded to be argumentative and said that they were completely booked and had only a non-smoking room with one king bed or a smoking room with two double beds. We decided to try the \"smoking\" room with the two double beds and got our keys. Upon entering the room, it became apparent that the clerk gave us the wrong room - she gave us the non smoking with the one bed. Hmmm. Went back downstairs and another person (perhaps an assistant manager?) helped us. Told her we were given the wrong room. She checked the computer and low and behold, she was able to find us a non-smoking room with two double beds; which is what we had reserved in the first place. Interesting. On our last day, we were sitting in the lobby waiting for our shuttle; sat in worn out chairs with a little round table between the chairs that had a sign that said something to the effect of no eating and no drinking. Really? Can't eat or drink anything in the lobby? It wasn't as if the lobby was at all pristine; it's in desperate need of a serious make-over. Whatever. So after sitting down in the chair with one leg tucked under me (I'm on the short side and my legs didn't reach the ground in that chair!), a guy that was working the bell desk approached us and told me that I needed to put my leg (the one tucked under me) on the floor. REALLY??? Was he being SERIOUS?? The bottom of my shoe was not touching any part of the worn out chair, and the sole of the shoe was rubber so there was no risk of damaging any part of the chair. My friend and I were completely speechless. Absolutely, unbelievably, ridiculous. The hotel staff definitely does NOT make their guests feel welcome at all, nor do they make their guests want to come back! Wanting to complain about this experience, I approached the front desk to get a comment card in order to give them, well, my comments. The clerk said they don't have comment cards, but that I could write my comments on a blank piece of paper and give it to her. Wow -- it just kept getting better and better! By this time I was so completely appalled at the lack of customer service and the lack of motivation on the part of the staff to establish any customer loyalty. With so much competition out there, the company should re-think their policy on customer service. It's the little things that make a trip memorable and keep people coming back. I will never return to this Holiday Inn. No one ever greeted us the entire weekend, whether we were coming or going, or walking through the lobby. I prefer to stay in hotels that treat me like a guest. They don't have to go out of their way to make me feel comfortable, but I do prefer to be treated with respect.", "Date": "March 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coventry, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cMarch 2008\u201d", "Author": "MaverickViper", "ReviewID": "UR14484681", "Content": "I wouldn't use this hotel again!

From check-in, to the wait staff in the breakfast restaurant, to the really annoyed man who took my money in the breakfast restaurant, to the rather put-off man at check-out who really did not want to make change for a $10.00 bill, everyone was phoning in their customer service. It was the first time in a long time I've experienced such a lack of effort on the hotel's part. The elevators were always crowded. They are simply too small to accommodate the number of guests using them. I was lucky enough to get a top floor room, so could enter the elevator easily. But it always stopped five or six times on the way down, and could really only hold about six people, so people on lower floors were not able to get in (not that they did not try). There is a sign in the elevator that asks guests not to steal the elevator signs. Not a good sign. The room was comfortable and here's one real plus: very quiet. I did not hear any street noise and there was very little plumbing/mechanical noise. I usually wake up a couple of times each night when staying in NYC and slept through the night here. The linen and bathroom were clean and fresh, the bed comfortable, and the television worked very well. The hotel wireless internet was free and worked well. The location is a little north of Times Square and a little out of the way from the sites of NY, but it's just three blocks from the subway and the hotel seemed to do a good job securing cabs, airport transport, etc. for guests. It was worth it to take advantage of the low rate, but I would not say it was in the thick of things.

I dont normally carry those kind of tools, so I called front desk and asked if I could borrow one from engineering. They said they would call and send someone up. I had my doubts about whether it would really happen, but 10 minutes later a maintenance guy was at my door and allowed me to use his screwdriver. He stopped by about 1/2 hr later to retrieve it. I just thought that was unusually good service for such an odd request. It was a pleasant surprise. I did not drive into the city, but if you were driving in this is a great hotel, as you can get right off the Westside Highway and park in their garage for a very reasonable price", "Date": "December 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cSuited me just fine!\u201d", "Author": "jessfm107", "ReviewID": "UR11488451", "Content": "I visited NYC with my mom for a few days in mid June.

In my opinion, this is a totally standard Holiday Inn, which is definately not suitable for business travellers, but is a good tourist's choice. As for the problems, some of which were written about in reviews here: The airconditioning is definately inadequate (I removed the filter from the airconditioner, which improved its performance greatly). Bathrooms are very small, and the sink is outside of them (this may be an advantage for some). The overall appearance of some of the rooms is \"shabby\". The rooms facing 57th street are extremely noisy - ask for one facing the inner court. Lifts are slow and full, especially in the morning. Vending / ice machines in the corridors make terrible noise - be sure that ask for a room far away from them. Doors slam shut by themselves, and most guests don't seem to care about letting this happen, causing noise for their neighbours. The lobby is too noisy to hold a conversation in. Internet (for those who don't have a laptop) is ridiculously expensive - $1 for 3 minutes. On the other hand: Rooms are quite large (for NYC), and are clean. There is a rooftop pool and sundeck. Breakfasts were good. The location is great (in my opinion, much better than the Times Square area). Subway is 5 minutes away. Bus is 1 minute away. Lots of diners / restaurants in the nearby.

It is the \"librarians'\" hotel for Book Expo. Last time our room was in the back tower facing onto 56th St. This time it was in the front of the building looking out on 57th St. 57th St is a busy, two-way street and gets lots of truck traffic, even late at night. We were on the 12th floor and it was still very loud. Plus the hotel room doors, like all too many, slam really loudly. It seems easing the doors closed is just too much to ask of 99.99% of all hotel guests, so you get the constant slamming of doors at all hours. Even worse, our room was directly across the hall from an ice machine that, inexplicably, was sitting right out in the hallway instead of in its own little alcove or room. Even when most folks were asleep, the machine kept making more ice and then noisily dumped it into the hopper. We had lunch in the lounge here the first day. The food was ok and somewhat fairly priced, but the beverages were outrageous. A flat Diet Coke, maybe 4 oz worth, was $4. Same with a small bottled water. Then they add 15% gratuity. I can understand adding gratuity to the bill for a large group, but adding it at a bar for a small group denies the patron the opportunity to express his or her level of satisfaction with the service, and therefore guarantees poor service. We tried to have breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning, but after waiting 25 minutes for a waiter, despite asking for one after 15, and seeing no fewer than 4 bored waiters wandering around with pitchers of coffee and juice, we got up and left. Pitiful service, no doubt because they know they have a guaranteed 15% coming to them no matter how bad the service. The hotel was in the process of renovation, so I won't comment on the cleanliness, although it wasn't too bad. Our room was a decent size, but the bathroom sink was separate from the shower/toilet room. Take note anyone thinking of sharing a room; there is little privacy while you shave/brush teeth, etc. The counter around the sink was so small that we had to keep our toiletries on the floor under the sink.

This is what my airport shuttle companions told me while driving from La Guardia to Columbus Circle. When I commented on the amount of construction taking place on 57th Street and its environs, the desk clerk suggested a room in their \"B\" wing which faced an interior courtyard rather than the street, adding \"Besides, there are two conventions in town and the house is full.\" Because I agreed to accept a smoking room rather than the non-smoking room I reserved, I was given a certificate good for a free drink at the bar and another certificate good for a free continental breakfast. So far, so good. The room turned out to be in an older wing of the building, and the smell of smoke permeating the corrider carpeting led me believe that the room itself would probably have cigarette burns on the furniture and carpeting. Nothing could have been further from the truth. The room itself was smell-free and had recently been scrubbed and vacuumed within in inch of its life. I can see why the locals like this place for their guests--the rooms are squeaky clean. Room service was good too.

I was surprised that free shower gel wasn't provided as this seems to be a fairly standard offering nowadays. The food in the hotel was ok. I was surprised to find that breakfast wasn't the usual Holiday Inn buffet, but just a menu-based affair - actually this worked out better for us, because they offered nice big bowls of fresh fruit and you just paid for what you ate - so if you don't feel like very much, you don't have to pay for the whole buffet.

Staff in the Holiday Inn were friendly on the whole, but some were quite cold. The concierge was very helpful with tour bookings and booking us a stretch limo back to the airport - it was a nice touch ... he asked if we had children and when I said yes, he said he'd make sure we got a stretch limo. We were very excited!! I found that there was little or no sound-proofing between rooms and the noise of tvs blaring could be heard through the night - this would normally drive me mad, but NYC wore me out so generally I was able to sleep through it. When we were there there seemed to be quite a few school groups staying in the hotel and that might have been the cause of the excess volume of the TVs! All in all, I'd recommend the hotel for its location and price, but would call it (relatively) cheap and cheerful rather than luxurious and pleasant!", "Date": "March 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "copenhagen, denmark", "Title": "\u201cgreat location & friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "ar74", "ReviewID": "UR7171374", "Content": "I stayed there for 6 days with my brother, and we definitely got, what we expected - great location, nice neighbourhood (local feeling), friendly staff and clean room!

We paid $204. per night (including all taxes) and have often paid much more in NYC and gotten much less. While not a luxury hotel, the room was clean and large. I stay in NY several times a year and I have to say it was probably the largest room I've had. The location was much quieter than other hotels we've stayed at. It seems like it's in a quiet zone as we heard very few cab horns at night. The room's appointments weren't brand new but were fine. Unlike another family who stayed there the same weekend, our HVAC was working fine and the protective construction scaffolding over the sidewalk was not an issue (didn't spend too much time looking at the outside of the hotel). The hotel provides free access to the basement-level health club which had a good selection of equipment and the usual towels, TVs, water, etc. It is, however, a windowless basement, frequented by people (and their trainers) who are there to work out, not see and be seen! If you're a runner, the location is just a couple of blocks from Central Park, one of the greatest places for city running in the world. We didn't eat at the hotel (who eats hotel food in NYC?!) but instead had great vegatarian, ethopian and indian dinners all within a 15 walk from the hotel. The concierge was very helpful in providing recommendations. Or just walk south on 8th, 9th or 10th avenues and find something that suits you. Skip the hotel breakfast and walk over to 8th avenue, head south a few blocks to the Bread Factory for a great breakfast. There is a major subway hub 2 blocks away at Columbus Circle (at the Time Warner building) where for 2 bucks you can take a train to Greenwich Village, 34th street shopping, The Natural History Museum, etc. While the hotel is not in the theater district, we opted for an easy walk back to the room after seeing a show rather than take a cab. Parking for 3 days was $54. Not a bad price at all for NYC. We checked out before noon on our last day and threw our bags in hotel storage for the day. While there was a nominal charge posted for bag storage, the bellman didn't charge us. All the hotel employees we encountered were very pleasant. While I do have to stress that this is not the Waldorf-Astoria or Palace, it is a very good choice for families or others who want a clean, comfortable, roomy, moderately-priced midtown location.", "Date": "March 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "North of England", "Title": "\u201cIdeal base to experience New York\u201d", "Author": "TheSlatersAandB", "ReviewID": "UR6898053", "Content": "My stepmum and I were treated to a trip to New York for our birthdays by my Dad.

The hotel is lovely & clean. The staff were very nice and helpful at the reception , the concierge & the room porter's. On every second floor there are vending machines for cans of minerals.(make sure you have one dollors handy as they cost 1.25$ but r the nicest in the world if u wake up in the middle of the night gasping!! They also offer pay -per -view movies, which is really good, esp if uv been out all day & ur in bed early with ur feet up. The room service is also really good, but avoid the steak( very fatty). The hotel isn't in a bad location , it is about 10 blocks from broadway & times square. But If I was going back I think I would stay closer to the main area. I couldn't honestly fault the hotel as it is really nice, and really holds its head high to be rated as a 3 star. The reason I think I was a bit disappointed in the location is because we walked the length & breath of NYC, so by the time I got to Broadway (I was saying oh nooo not another 10 blocks!!) To stay somewhere closer good spots are the wellington, or the edison. also the Pennsylvania Hotel which is a good location, but to be honest as a travel Agent I have heard some nasty stories about it..I would highly reccommend the Holiday Inn, but I wouldn't oversell it for it's location.However there is a subway stop on 59th street that will bring you downtown, soho etc for $2pp one way.Shopping Tips for NYC: go to Pearl River in Soho, go to Cliquers on 34th Street across the road from Macy's and down a bit towards the empire state building. And also watch out for a chain shop called Rainbow, there is one on 34th St & 57th St ( next to the Holiday Inn. ALso if you are going in October try to stay for the night of the 31st and go see the Halloween Parade( the New Yorkers take it to the next level.) I was so disappointed that we were coming home on the 31st and missed it. One more tip for NYC.. if you want nice accommodation & not too expensive book the radio city apartments, excellent location, really clean and handy.You can book these through [-] or through your travel agent as sometimes the radio city give out their allocation to agents, so their website may not have availability but you will get it from another agent,but book early as they are really popular. Also one more tip: when coming from the airport instead of getting a taxi which will probably rip you off, book a shuttle on [-], it is so convienent & inexpensive. When you arrive in JFK go to the Ground Transportation desk and hand them your confirmation, the mini bus takes about 8/9 ppl and in turn drops you off at each hotel, on the return you ring super shuttle 24 hours before you travel home to reconfirm your booking and flight number, they will give you a new reservation number and a pick up time to be outside your hotel. The best thing about this is that when you pay for it at time of booking you know how much you will be charged etc, as taxis in nyc charge while they stand in traffic. If you want to tip the driver then that is up to yourself. And finally I just have to say that the 2 shopping trips one to Jersey Gardens & one to Woodbury Common are great. If you are stuck for time and money then go to Jersey Gardens(30 mins of a journey & it has a Nike Factory shop, Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren etc, it is indoors and compact. Also it is a lot cheaper and shorter journey to get to than Woodbury Common, You go to the 2 nd Building on the left ( when you are standing in front of it looking at it) at the Bus Port Authority , go to the desk ask for your return ticket to Jersey Gardens , go to exit 222 and look for bus NJ Transit 111( this may change from time to time, ) Woodbury Common is also great but it takes an hour to get here and costs about $48pp for the bus alone as you are buying this from a new york sights seeing company.) Woodbury Common is outdoors and has loadsa shops, george Beene, Donna Karen, Armani , Gucci, Adidas Factory, Nike Factory. But to be honest if you are not into Gucci etc, Jersey Gardens is def the place to go. It has everything woodbury Common has but less expensive to get there!!Happy Shopping!!", "Date": "January 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queensland , Australia", "Title": "\u201cvery good stay\u201d", "Author": "Boey-7", "ReviewID": "UR6709646", "Content": "Had a very nice stay at this hotel, good location, clean and tidy, friendly staff. beds a bit old and food just ok, but overall it was a very nice visit to the big apple.Thankyou Holiday inn.", "Date": "January 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicestershire", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location\u201d", "Author": "26travellers", "ReviewID": "UR6693217", "Content": "We stayed at the Holiday Inn Midtown for two nights in January, rooms were very spacious and clean as was the hotel.

We arrived about two hours prior to check in and there was no problem getting into our room early. The staff was very friendly and helpful with everything from restaurants to shopping to subway routes. The rooms are huge for NY and the linens were very clean (I love crisp white sheets.)

Rooms are extremely spacious by NY standards, with plenty of space for suitcases etc. The bed was very comfortable & never had any problems sleeping at night. The decor is ok & room amenities just fine. Housekeeping was efficient. The hotel is well located & within walking distance to the main tourist spots. Central Park is just a couple of blocks away, & Times Square, a leisurely 10-15 minute stroll. We walked everywhere, apart from to the financial district, when we used the subway. Always felt safe when walking around, even at night. There are loads of great traditional Diners near to this hotel & most are open 24hrs. This means you can always get something good to eat & you dont need to rely on the hotel, where the restaurants are on the pricier side. I would definitely choose this hotel again as it really was a good value for money base to explore NYC. This is not a luxury hotel, but then it doesn't pretend to be. Its a clean & affordable option with spacious rooms & friendly staff. If you're going to New York to shop & do the tourist thing, then the Holiday Inn Midtown is a good choice. Why spend loads on many of the other big chains (Hilton / Renaissance / Westin etc) when you can get the same amenities for much less.

We had never been to NYC before, and thought it would be ideal for a short holiday. The city and attractions were fantastic, however our experience with this hotel was extremely disappointing. We are well travelled and have stayed in hotels all over the world. Never have we had such sub-standard accommodation. We do know what to expect from a 3 star property, having stayed in many without incident. Our room was on a non-smoking floor, which we had requested - however the smoke from the room below came through the vents continuously and consequently, not only did the room have the foul odour which pervaded the entire hotel, we were subjected every day to strong cigarette odour. I have quite severe allergies and could barely manage to complete our stay here. There were food service trays in the hallways every day - the same ones that were there when we arrived. During the entire 4 days these were never removed and the odour of rotting food grew in intensity very quickly. Our room was not serviced each day. On our way out one morning we encountered a member of the housekeeping staff who threw a number of disheveled towels in our direction and were told that was it for the day! We had to return to our room to leave the towels. The shower handle fell off at least twice during every shower and the shower itself was anything but powerful - a mere trickle would be an exaggeration. I could never get all the shampoo rinsed from my hair before the water turned ice cold. Unfortunately, the only positive thing I can say about this hotel is that all the concierge staff we dealt with were pleasant, knowledgable, friendly and would obtain tickets quickly for any attraction you might want. Overall, this was one of the worst hotels we have stayed at throughout our many years of travelling. We did not eat at the hotel, but did find adequate restaurants (although expensive - I guess that is what you should expect in New York) in the area. We did feel safe walking at night as there were so many people about. Overall, even though this is an inexpensive hotel by New York standards, we have stayed in many finer Holiday Inns and I cannot honestly recommend this location - just too many negatives!", "Date": "August 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cick ick ick!!!!\u201d", "Author": "shuede", "ReviewID": "UR5597680", "Content": "I stayed here last weekend with my two children.

The location of this hotel is good for exploring the city. A major subway hub is only 1.5 blocks away at Columbus Circle. Lincoln Center, Central Park, and the theater district are an easy walk from this hotel.

Leadership is abysmal, and is reflected in the outrageous treatment given to the guests by the employees. First, let me say this is a beautiful hotel and there are a few very good employees (especially the people who clean the rooms). However, for the most part, the employees reflect the worst attitudes possible in the service industry. 1. ATTITUDE. NO ONE SMILES. In fact, there appears to be a significant effort on the part of employees behind the reception counter, and in the restaurant, to avoid smiling, even when charming customers from various countries are smiling at them. 2. ATTITUDE. EMPLOYEES AND MANAGEMENT ARE RUDE. Employees behind the reception counter act as if it is a great inconvenience to them to have to listen to a customer. They interrupt before they know what the issue is, and they treat customers rudely. Again, not all employees, but most. 3. ATTITUDE. CUSTOMERS ARE THE PROBLEM. There is no effort to fix problems, but, rather, to make excuses for why they can't be fixed, especially at the management level. The bell hop dropped my computer monitor. I reported it to security and they took a report. I heard nothing more about the incident. The next morning, I walked by a bell hop I believed to be the one who mishandled my monitor. He said something like \"two, two, two.\" I didn\u2019t know if that was a curse, or if he was saying something to the man next to him who was on the phone. It sounded more like a spit than words. 4. VALUE. YOU GET HALF OF WHAT YOU PAY FOR. There are two kinds of hotels. One provides a bed, the other provides a wonderful experience that makes guests want to come back, and to tell their friends. This hotel provides a bed (plus a bad experience). I can't recommend it to anyone. 5. GRATUITIES (TIPS). GRATUITIES ARE MANDATORY, NO EXCEPTION. Gratuities are automatically added to every check, at the bar, and in the restaurant, even for one person. There was no clear answer about the percentage rate of the tip, only that it was \u201cminimal,\u201d whatever that means. This allowed the employees to take a \"could care less\" attitude, and most did. The occasional employee with excellent social skills gets screwed out of a good tip. 7. RESTAURANT. RESTAURANT SERVICE IS RUDE. Waiters walk away while the customer is ordering, the music playing is most inappropriate, and is set to produce the familiar echo of over-amplified third-world radio stations. When I asked one waiter if the tip was included, he quickly said it was included, grabbed the bill and my credit card and disappeared. The two numbers at the bottom of the check that looked like they could have been tax and tip weren't labeled, and seemed way out of proportion. He didn't bother to show me the tip, or tell me how it was calculated. The only thing that came back with my credit card was the receipt for my signature. I was in a hurry, so I didn't question him on it. It made me feel like he stole from me, even if he didn't. 8. BAR. THE BAR IS BORING AND FRUSTRATING (BECAUSE OF THE STAFF, NOT THE GUESTS). I was at the bar for about an hour one night. There appeared to be two bartenders. One was constantly away getting food for the bar, while the other sat in a chair at the bar doing paperwork. The two employees appeared to be at each other throats. The bar was full, and people were upset that they couldn\u2019t get service. But why should the bartenders provide service when their tips are automatically included in the bill? The bar environment would drive any employee crazy (and the customers hated it too). There was disco music playing from the PA system and a loud TV playing in the lounge area of the bar. It was the most pathetic bar experience I have ever had. 9. COMPUTER ACCESS. SOMETIMES THE WIRELESS NETWORK PROVIDES PLUG AND PLAY ACCESS. I was given a wireless network bridge to attach to my computer so I could use the wireless network in the hotel. This is a free service to customers with computers. For 8 hours I worked with the people providing bridge service via a 1-800 number. Most of the time was spent waiting on them to get back to me. Finally, they had me change out the equipment at the desk, and that solved the problem. They guy behind the desk said \"you should have just brought it back right away.\" That wasn't helpful or fair, since one of the people at the desk told me to make the calls to the support company. 10. VENDING. THERE ISN\u2019T ANY VENDING. I went to floors 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, and 18. Those are the floors with soft drink machines. Not one of the machines worked (see pics). This was reported to management on the first day I was there, and it was that way when I left. On the last day, I bumped into one of the bell hops in the elevator, and even he knew there were no soft drinks to be had from the vending machines. The hotel manager whined that he could only advise the restaurant that the machines needed to be filled. But why should the restaurant fill the machines that charge $1.25 for a soft drink, when they sell the same soft drink from a refrigerator in the restaurant for $2.00, plus never having to work to keep the machines filled? The boutique/store in the hotel is forbidden to sell soft drinks. 11. HOUSEKEEPING. HOUSEKEEPING IS GREAT. The housekeeping staff did a marvelous job. They were very friendly and courteous and the room always looked great. Out of 5 stars (5 being the highest), this one gets a 1. The housekeeping staff kept it from getting a zero. It could have been amazing, but it wasn\u2019t even mediocre.", "Date": "November 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location.

Our reservation requested non- smoking room, when we walked into the room, the air reeked of stale smoke. The bathroom smelled of sour towels , wallpaper in the room was FILTHY!! Furthermore carpet had lost its life about 5 years earlier, it was faded, dirty and smelled. When we asked the front desk to change rooms, the response was a smug, we have no other rooms available. We are filled to capacity. All this for 203.00 a night!!

We arrived late in the day, the receptionist was quick and nothing was too much trouble. I had emailed the hotel about 2 weeks before our stay and asked for a newly renovated room in A block, which we got. The staff were friendly especially Carl the consierge, he is a real credit to the hotel. We had breakfast in the hotel on our last morning and wished we had gone before, the waiters were quick, polite and again nothing was too much trouble. I have stayed in New York before at the Grand Hyatt on 42nd street, the hotel was grand indeed, but as far as comparing the rooms go for the holiday inn, they are much larger, cleaner and cheaper. On the whole if you are looking for a good quailty hotel, without paying th earth then the Holiday Inn is for you.", "Date": "December 8, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Holiday Inn Midtown / 57th St", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d93344-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Midtown_57th_St-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$204 - $331*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">440 West 57th Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10019</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514344", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/28/e9/28e900557c0d2fbf3a7ec70ca5bffc1714large.jpg"}}
