Baptiste Masot took care of our train tickets to Bordeaux and Sophie Ardennes searched until she found the restaurant with the best Canard Confit that fit into our busy Easter schedule.

Ludivine Ughetto helped us get off to the airport in time and provided us with the correct spelling of everyone\u2019s name that had assisted us all week. Hyatt Regency can buy all of the best amenities, beautiful design, pricey real estate and the finest accouterments to make a stunning hotel and trust me when I tell you that they have spared no expense at The Hyatt Regency Paris \u2013 Madeleine. But no amount of money can make a five star hotel\u2026.

The location of this hotel is \"OK\", but not ideal or on par with other five star properties in Paris. I've lived in Paris several times, and travel there for business often. Therefore I can honestly say if you are truly seeking a five star property there are many other hotels in better locations, closer to the metro, and offer better amenities, facilities, and service. Even knowing all of this I decided to give this property a go. I'm a Diamond member with Hyatt and never staying here before, thought why not try something new. Sadly that wasn't the best decision. Like many hotels in Paris, this property is fairly small. The size of the property isn't its downfall; it's the management and operations of this property. A smaller hotel means fewer rooms, fewer staff to manage, and fewer guests to look after. Combine all of that with this claiming to be a five star property, and one would expect an exceptionally well-run property with outstanding service. Surprisingly this couldn't be further from the truth. I experienced issues with virtually every customer touch point this property offers. I was assigned an appropriate room; I don't think my reservation had even been looked at until I arrived on-site. I was \"kicked\" out of their restaurant and exiled to their Champagne bar while entertaining business clients because I wanted to have a coffee. Their cleaning staff wasn\u2019t the most efficient and their breakfast buffet is beyond basic. To all my fellow Diamond members, if you are use to being treated like a valued guest and dealing with staff that have been properly trained on Gold Passport policies, then this most definitely isn't the property for you. I spoke with two managers and both were completely clueless on basic Gold Passport policy and procedures. I eventually had to make a call to Hyatt Corporate who then contacted the property and educated them on very standard Hyatt policies. It\u2019s truly sad when a guest knows your own company\u2019s policies better than your own managers. Not only is that tragic, but it\u2019s unbecoming of a five star property. I stay 300 nights a year in hotels, so I have a good understanding on what makes a five star property. All in all I personally rate this hotel a three star parading around as a five star. I\u2019m sure it could probably skin by as a four star property but a five star it most certainly isn\u2019t. So save yourself some money and hassle and book elsewhere. You\u2019ll be glad you did.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful stay - highly recommended\u201d", "Author": "Will58", "ReviewID": "UR123588300", "Content": "This smallish Hyatt in the Madeleine is wonderful.

Cons: - the hallway had an odd smell, like smoke and cleaning chemicals combined. - the heat was so hot, even though we had it turned off, we had to sleep with the windows open in January - we used points to stay for free and they put us in a tiny back closet of a room. Upon exiting the elevator, at the very end of the hall, there is a door you need a key to open - when you open that door, you are in a very small space with 2 rooms each with their own key - we stayed in one of these rooms. This configuration where basically our entrance was shared with another room was very obnoxious - people were extremely loud coming in and out of the room next to us, which was no doubt amplified by the tiny space. A couple nights the people in the room next to us had children screaming (playing) until past midnight. The fact that this is the type of hotel where kids can scream and run up and down the hallways until past midnight should speak volumes. - the bed was hard and not very comfortable. - the breakfast is extremely expensive in the hotel.... and not very good. Do yourself a favor and eat at ANY of the little cafes around here..... much better value. Breakfast buffet was 72 euro for 2 people and was NOT worth that, and a glass of wine at the bar at night was 17 euro. This is a huge rip off. The best thing was the location.

The concierge who arrange my trip to the Eiffel tower ended up charging me for two days of tickets and I still (2 months later) have not been reimbursed. The maid service was bizarre.

It is under a glass ceiling in the courtyard, so you can sit there even if it's raining. So cozy and relaxing after the hustle/bustle of the streets of Paris.

We went from CDG to the Opera Metro stop, then took Metro to Madeleine stop. But lots of walking with suitcases on crowded streets, and many stairs in Metro.

The bed is extremely comfortable. The only issue with the road facing room is the noise of the traffic outside, mainly because the road is cobbled and tyre noise is pronounced.

The hotel is reasonably well located in the 8eme. Our room was minute. Probably the smallest double hotel room I have ever slept in. There was only room for a bedside table on one side of the bed. These tiny attic rooms in old Paris apartment buildings used to be called the \"chambre de bonne\" and were where the housemaid lived. The Hyatt should use them for something similar and should not be charging them out for Euros 550 a night (ie. \u00a3500 or US$800). That is the rack rate - we actually paid a rate of Euros 460 which remains dreadful value. Decoration was contemporary but bland. The bed was narrow, and presumably the smallest that can be called a \"double\" bed. It had a good firm mattress and the duvet and linen were fine. The ventilation system functioned, but the aircon cooling system seemed to have been turned off for the winter (we asked reception to do something and nothing happened). The room was hot, stuffy and airless. The window wouldn\u2019t stay open but it provided some respite. There was a narrow balcony. Wifi is extra which is incredible. The bathroom was suitably small. The water pressure for the bath was so low it took 15mins to run a bath. Oddly the shower (over the bath) had good pressure. Hand towel was dirty. Good flat screen TV with MP3 jack. Poor selection of English language channels. Complimentary 1/2 bottle of red bordeaux. Service was average at best. Main lobby \"lounge\" area etc is small, and pleasant enough.

We stayed at the Hyatt Madeline on the weekends before and after our tour. The Hyatt Madeline is located on an area bordering the 8th & 9th Arrondissements and has the advantage of both. There are metro stops within easy walking distances: Saint Augustin to the north and Madeline to the south. It is close to Boulevard Haussman with its major department stores and attendant shops and brasseries and, in the other direction, a 15 minute stroll will take you to the Place de la Concorde and several designer boutiques. I understand the neighborhood is also the Financial District -- there are several small eateries around to cater to local business people. Photos here and on the hotel's own web site are accurate. The facilities are luxurious. We had an Executive Room on the sixth floor, directly beneath the top floor, which is itself the Presidential Suite. Furnishings were in excellent condition -- the room was tastefully decorated with light cherry wood and cream walls. Our bed was very comfortable. The entire room was well laid out and the bathroom provided a deep tub with separate shower and plenty of hot water. The television/entertainment center provided a good array of channels in several languages -- five for English -- as well as movies and musix. I loved the exercise room -- our fitness center at home (L.A. Fitness) is barely a year old and they could take a lesson from this hotel. Equipment was fantastic and quite sophisticated. If you want access to the internet, there is a charge: 12 euros for 12 hours and 18 euros for 24 hours. This is pretty much what you have to pay elsewhere so, while pricey for non-Europeans, it is not out of line. We were very impressed by the cleanliness of both our room and the entire facility. All areas are immaculate. We would leave our room for breakfast and see the occasional room service tray in the hallway outside of a door. By the time we returned from our meal, it would be gone. The staff takes great care and there was a supervisor who checked with us every day to make sure we'd received good service with our room. And now this brings me to the staff and it is here that I reserve my highest accolades. We planned to stay that last weekend for only two days. However, due to the volcanic eruption in Iceland and the subsequent ash cloud that grounded all flights, we found ourselves guest of this hotel for several days longer than we anticipated. We observed the daily ritual of guests checking out in the morning only to see them check back in as promised flights never materialized. Those people were tired, and upset. The staff dealt with them -- and us -- with unfailing courtesy, professionalism, and compassion. And for the most part, they did so in our languages (and I stress the plural), not theirs. The manager assured us that we could stay as long as we wanted and would not be penalized if we checked out with little notice. The doorman always wished us a cheery \"Bonjour!\" as we exited the hotel for our day and, after awhile, ventured to ask us how we were doing, and were we okay? The staff in the hotel's cafe always remembered how my husband liked his coffee (horribly weak and I'm sure they must have inwardly winced). They gave inspired suggestions for walks about the city to places we enjoyed and brasseries where real people went. Not one person ever betrayed what must have been going on behind the scenes with the massive disruption to their bookings. It was professionalism of the highest caliber. So what does this mean when times return to normal? It means that if I ever had to plan a meeting, host a banquet, or choose a hotel in which to stay, I'd want these people on my team. We cannot thank them enough for making what could have been a stressful and disappointing time into a delightful, if unexpected, extension of our vacation. We would enthusiastically recommend this hotel to anyone. And if the Hyatt chain gives out awards for Grace Under Fire, this hotel can claim it. It truly lives up to its 5-star rating.", "Date": "April 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cVery Arrogant Staff.........but nice bed\u201d", "Author": "TrendyEnglish30", "ReviewID": "UR61061463", "Content": "The lobby is a bit over done with lamps and table bling.

Our luggage was brought up to our room immediately. The rooms are small in comparison to Hyatt rooms in the US, but then again, most hotels in Europe have smaller rooms than in the US. However, the room was very clean, and still spacious enough for us to fit to large suitcases. There was an in-room safe which was helpful.

After getting ready, we headed to the front desk... the staff was very helpful and showed us how to get to the sites, etc. they also had information and could have booked tours for us, but we had already taken care of that from home. They had a business center, basically it was one computer with internet access... free of charge. so it was good enough for us to send a quick email home. The staff was absolutely wonderful.. im a vegetarian so my husband asked the staff on recommendations for dinner, keeping that in mind, and not only did they recommend restaurants, they called and set up the reservations for us. Further, they always remembered that who we were and the little things like I was a vegetarian etc. I also requested a late check out as we werent leaving Paris until the evening which they gladly accommodated and allowed us to store our luggage at the hotel until departure. Further, they were able to get us immediate taxis etc when required. I cannot speak enough of how wonderful the staff was. We had some snacks and late night drinks at the restaurant. It was decent... however, i do not recommend staying in when there are so many restaurants in the area. We never had breakfast at the hotel as it wasnt included and sometimes our tours left before the dining room had opened. However, there was a bakery/sandwich shop right across the street which was probably more affordable. The location of the hotel was perfect. It was quiet, but still busy enough that you felt comfortable walking in the evening. We were about a 10 minute walk from the Louvre and 15 minute walk from the Champs-d'elysees. Notre Dame was an additional 10 minute walk from the Louvre, but completely doable. Furthere, there were several stores, shops in the area for all types of shopping.

Check in \u2013 quick, accurate but not that friendly. I was pleased that my room was ready on arrival at 1 pm. Entering the Executive King (204, right next to elevator, when I had asked specifically to be far from it), I was hit with blast furnace heat. I tried to adjust the thermostat, but could only turn it on or off with various fan settings. The room was very quiet, however, with double pane windows, but I knew that I would have to open some windows to relieve the heat. And it was very noisy with the fresh air. So I went back to front desk and asked to be moved. The room - they were happy to move me, and within a few minutes I was shown a second room, a Deluxe King, for 100 euro less a night. This room was extremely quiet, overlooking a courtyard, even with the windows open (although I agree with other reviewers about doors slamming, footsteps, construction pounding, and other interior hotel noise). The size of the two rooms seemed to be the same, although the Deluxe bathroom was bigger. It also looked a bit dingier \u2013 carpet were not that clean, there were three insufficient lights (the room was rather dark), and other than an uncomfortable desk chair, no place to sit. There was very little tabletop space, and no clock anywhere. A large flat screen TV worked the first day but did not the day I checked out. The bed was hard as rocks (much like those in China) with a nice sheets and a good duvet (but a bit hot). Wireless internet access was available for 23 Euro a day. The minibar was the move anything get charged type, but there was a small area for personal stuff. The bathroom \u2013 spacious, well-lit, sufficient towels. Tub was difficult to get in and out of and the rain shower, with water falling straight down, made it hard not to bump into the temperature water control knob. I had problems with temperature control throughout my stay (including in the shower). Whatever came out of the vents was very warm, so I opened the windows. But once the windows were open, the heating shut off. Meaning that it was have the windows closed and bake or open them up and freeze.

I also ate lunch at La Chinnoserie and was pleased with the quality of the food and the service. Fitness center/spa \u2013 there is a small exercise room, a relaxation lounge, and locker rooms with steam and sauna. The Hyatt website is misleading about the services offered though. I booked a manicure and pedicure, expecting something like what you get in the US with a soak, scrub, moisturizer and massage, as well as a polish. The esthetician came in with a suitcase of equipment and I had to sit on a table like at a doctors office. I wasn\u2019t sure about the cleanliness of the implements, and the services were really just cut, shape, and polish. Very, very expensive for this minimal treatment. Location \u2013 good, but not great, in my opinion. A few blocks from two metro stations. Sidewalks in Paris can be bumpy and uneven, which makes for strenuous walks. Monoprix is a few blocks north, good to pick up stuff so you don\u2019t have to pay extortionist prices from the minibar. There was absolutely nothing open on Sunday.

The hotel is absolutely lovely. It only has 86 rooms so you get the best of both worlds- the boutique charm and size size coupled with the professionalism and care of a major worlwide chain . The decor is great -- a modern yet comfortable Parisian look. Our room was just fabulous with a large king size bed with crisp white linens, feather pillows, and a feather duvet. The drapes were plush and oversized giving the modern room a very warm feel. There was a huge flat screen TV and movies on demand along with your basic international channels like BBC and CNN etc. The room has high speed internet access if you need to bring work with you or their business center has free internet as well. The bathroom was amazing with mirrored walls and marble flooring. There was a huge jacuzzi tub and a seperate shower with great water pressure. We had a view of the Eiffel Tower which was so incredible to see at night when we were getting ready for the evening. The staff is just so helpful and FRIENDLY (don't listen to the rumors about mean Parisians) and go out of there way to make your stay great. Ask for the concierge, Aurore Dinis, if you go. She sat down with us for a glass of champagne when we arrived to help us figure out where we should eat each night etc. She made all the bookings for us and her suggestions could not have been better. She even helped us with a personal errand on her day off after we left because my husband bought something in the wrong size --so she exchanged it for us and had it sent to us the next day! Now that is service. We have been alot of places and have never been treated so well. They convert their sitting area in to a restaurant for meal times which is so great because you feel like you are eating in your living room. We had breakfast at the hotel every morning and it was just fabulous. We also had lunch on our last day and it was delicious as well. The location is great. My husband and I walked everywhere on our trip because the weather was nice (It is about a 10-15 minute walk to the Louvre) and felt like that was a sight in its own. Just walking through the streets of Paris is a joy so it makes the effort worth the while. Plus, then you can eat all the french food you want. However, apparently their metro is great.

I didn't know about this web site until recently or I would have posted our feedback after our trip. I figure it's never too late to give feedback! We really liked the style of this hotel - small, boutique and right in the middle of real French neighborhoods. We enjoyed walking around the area each morning and evening and eating at local bistros and restaurants as do the locals and shopping where they do each day. (We recall the restaurant across the street from the hotel did a great job at making a fine French ravioli dish one night - who would have thought the French could do a great pasta dish but, they did! We ended up eating there two nights due to this and the owner gave us complimentary wine and desert the second time - how nice!!!). From the hotel, it's a few quick blocks to the Place de la Concorde, Fouchons, Maximes, The Louvre, The Tuillieres Gardens, The River Seine, a Metro station and more. Great location if you ask me. Much like other reviewers, we agree the room we got was VERY small. Room for a queen sized bed, one night table, a desk/chair, tv and just enough room to pass by each other if we didn't each too much each night! The furniture, textiles etc. were all in good shape and the bathroom was top notch and modern as can be (you will give this place high marks after spending weeks throughout France and seeing what they call bathrooms in many places - holes in the ground...no wash clothes...no ice....limited towels...carpet that is like burlap to the feet and more!). LIke many hotels in Europe, the AC and heat are PRE-regulated so, don't try adjusting up and down all the time - they don't allow that as they conserve energy more than we do. The lights also don't go on unless you put in your room card - that way - when you leave, lights have to go off again - more energy conservation. We had a courtyard view - so-so. Room service was always prompt - including the food service and the cleaning staff. The front desk and concierge were very nice to us and very helpful. We especially enjoyed one bell hop who spoke many languages and was always chatty and friendly. We should have told them we were on our honeymoon and gotten a better room but, they appeared booked so, we didn't want to up and move in the middle after we had already done so much travel. We lived with it and it was fine. Like anything...try learning a little French and using it as much as you can. Even though we spoke it poorly, our attempts and smiles went a long way to good treatment both at the hotel and in the city. I had two years of French and french grandparents - that helped a bit. My husband had no French - although he did the accent poorly and massacred a few words - the French gave us two thumbs up for our honest attempts at the language and customs.
