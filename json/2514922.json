Communication with the hotel prior to our stay was very efficient and our request for a quiet room had obviously been noted, as our room (no, 45) was at the back of the hotel on the fourth floor. The sun was streaming in when we arrived, and we had a reasonable view over rooftops. The double glazing blocks out just about all sound - there must be a school nearby, but we were only aware of children playing in the mornings when the window was open. The room itself was clean and quite spacious, and the bed was very comfortable. The bed in one of the neighbouring rooms was squeaky and the sound of toilets flushing in the middle of the night was a bit annoying, but not the end of the world. The bathroom was also a decent size with a bath and shower attachment. There was plenty of hot water and a good array of toiletries was provided.

I wanted to find a spot in Montmartre, as I had not stayed there befor, and frankly was in love with the whole history of this part of Paris. You have to note now that Montmartre is a real 'neighborhood', as there are schools, families, community, but... it is also very much a night life part of Paris. IT WILL BE LOUD!!! at night, how ever, if you accept it, it is wonderful! That being said, the Hotel was quiet, clean, and above attentive, if you needed it to be. The room we stayed in was 'the Dali' #41, it was on the fourth floor, and overlooks the street below. bath-room with shower, closet with safe, nice little writing desk, and a large patio, to enjoy. The colors are warm and calming, and the bed is firm. (which I like). There is a small elevator, to bring you up to your room, or a beautiful long spiral staircase (if you havnt been 'staired out' by your walks through Paris...land of a million stairs). The Whole place is kept immaculate! So clean, very pretty! Coming home every night brought us a sense of great comfort, in fact there were a few day where we had come home early, and just stayed in the hotel for the rest of the night. All of the staff we met, were friendly, and helpful. they all spoke perfect english, and humored our attempts to speak french. The Hotel is centered nicely between the metro stations BLANCHE or ABBESSES (although we used Blanche almost always). they do provide a airport shuttle (for a small fee), and are very good at providing info about the area, and city in general. Again the staff was really good! If you are looking for a very romantic get away, its a great choice.

However our experience I am afraid directly contradicted this. Hotel des Arts is located in a narrow, steepish street, bustling with people at all times of the day and night. The reception was friendly enough, the room was very small and dark with poor lighting - quite claustrophobic; the shower even smaller (perhaps the smallest cubicle I have ever used). There was no mirror or proper lighting in the bedroom so we had to share the mirror in the bathroom for hair, shaving, make-up and every other luxury! The room overlooked a very small dark square of a yard. The daylight was somewhere up above. This wasn't a problem; what was a problem was that during the night the moving of what we think was rubbish bins in the yard below exploded into our consciousness at least twice on each night, giving me quite a fright the first time it happened; the noise was so loud that even ear plugs had no effect. People talking in the lobby at all times of the night, woke us and kept us both awake. Then at 6.30am on the first morning we were awoken by a member of staff shouting \"taxi\". Wrong door; wrong people. The second night the chamber maid unlocked the door and made to enter our bedroom whilst we were both in bed in the morning; she thought we would be at breakfast. We were not amused. In all the hotel was very expensive (in our view) for what it provided - minimum additions; even the one bottle of water on the desk which we drank the first evening was not replaced for the second day. The old bottle was simply left there. We could not help reflecting that this would never happen in even the most basic of bed and breakfast accommodation that we have experienced elsewhere.

To get from the airport I would recommened going to Absesses station from the airport, theres 2 changes but it is so easy to walk to the hotel from there.

We were in room 63 on the top floor with a view of the Eiffel Tower. The lift goes up to level 5,and a staircase to level 6. There were little shower products in the bathroom which was a nice touch. No tea/coffee making facilites in the room. We didnt eat breakfast in the hotel, but only because there were so many nice little places in the area to eat.

Bathroom was cramped but very clean and stocked with good toiletries. Breakfast is served in a small, tidy room in the basement, from 7am. I did not like the coffee. Food was okay -- the sort of bread and croissants that French supermarkets sell. Nearby bakeries offer much tastier treats (Les Petits Mitrons on rue Lepic and Le Grenier a Pain Abbesses are a couple of favorites). Charming Coquelicot bakery/restaurant, at 24 rue des Abbesses, serves breakfast and has some tables outside too.

Fresh croissants, pains au chocolat and brioches to die for. Boiled eggs, cheeses and fruit salad with assorted yoghurts washed down with fresh orange juice and proper coffee and tea. Set us up ideally for the challenges Paris has to offer. The neighbourhood had everything we needed within a short walk and Montmartre at sundown is a delight!! And if you want good beer and nice food within spitting distance, climb the hill to the top and visit the bar Autour Du Moulin..- recommended especially during happy hour.

Our superior twin room with very modern bathroom was quite large enough with flat screen TV and more than adequate. The weather was unseasonably warm so it did get rather hot with no A/C and there was not the usual tea making equipment.

Montmatre: Loved it, good atmosphere, great restaurants and cafes. Abbesses metro is good to exit via the lift, but to enter you have to use a spiral staircase 100+steps... instead walk down hill to Blanche metro, outside the Moulin Rouge, easier with a suitcase. Gare du Nord: Be very careful of the nasty ticket touts trying to help (interfere) with you at the ticket machines. Buy from the Ticket Office Desk, despite the queues. We purchased a 3 day pass for travel in the 3 main zones. Sacre-Coeur... we visited from the steps at the bottom of Montmatre hill, be very careful of the illegal street traders trying to temp you with their crap. We were stopped and they were reasonably forceful - having some rough neck pressing his finger into your chest because you won't give him the time of day... had to push him away with equal force.

The room was a bit small but okay. The only problem was that it was near the front desk on the first floor so you could hear people coming & going and talking at night. Also we had a window to the courtyard where two rooms had entrances so it wasn't too pleasant to keep the window or curtains open. The cleaners left the window open during the day after they had cleaned and I was a bit worried about our belongings. The staff was okay, not too friendly but helped if you needed something. There was a lounge area near the front desk with tourist books & a computer you could use, which was very helpfull. I guess the hotel is a find in Paris as the price isn't as high as in many other 3 star hotels, the location is great and the rooms are clean & cosy. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel but in the cafe's at Rue des Abbesses, we loved to look at the people and the shops and enjoy our breakfast with fresh croissants. The area was lively, there were loads of bars, restaurants and cafe's, narrow streets and loads of steps, many people, small shops, some bohemic feeling mixed with tourists, music and artists, students and people of all ages. The atmosphere was awesome, you could listen to live music on the corner of the streets, buy antiques on the weekend market and climb up to see maybe the best view over Paris. The subway is fast but if u have time, take the bus when you can and see the city while you go. In Paris I would recommend the Louvre when it's open late and has less queues and Arc de Triomphe at night when the sun is going down, great views!

Room did not have aircon or fan but could open window, which was sufficient most of the time. The one thing I don't like about this hotel is its policy that you can't eat in the room. I had remembered it vaguely reading about it in one of Tripadviser's reviews but did not consider then to be a major consideration. So before checking in, I had bought Chinese takeout. Then when I read about the hotel policy, I quickly had to leave the room and walk 3 blocks to Sacre Coeur to have the food as I was afraid it would stink the room. This is the 1st time I had to deal with this policy anywhere and I must say I don't like it. I'm not the sort of person who enjoys eating out alone and would rather have dinner in the privacy of my own hotel room. This hotel is in an area, where there's plenty of food to buy, and take back to your hotel. I honestly believe this is a major turn-off.

I went by reviews on trip advisor and I was not disappointed. A stunning, boutique hotel filled with character and set in a fantastic location on the cusp of montmartre, a stone's throw from sacre coeur. Less than 5 minutes walk from Blanche, Pigalle or Abesses Metro stations (don't take the stairs in Abesses!), even the street on which the hotel sits is everything you would imagine Paris to be. The rooms had an antique style, in burgundys and golds, topped off with a stunning juliette balcony overlooking the charming, quiet side street (although there is a bar right opposite which got a little loud at night). The bathroom was glimmering white, very clean, all with the expected facilities and a lovely shower. The twin room was a nice size, perfect for the two of us, not at all cramped, with two single beds. The staff were extremely friendly and highly accommodating, although there was a small slip up with a couple of the tips they gave us, one of which telling us that Versaille was open on May 1st, now if i've learnt anything from my trip to Paris, it's that nothing in France is open on May 1st, not even Versaille! We still got to see the stunning gardens though and it was a beautiful day for it. But just make sure you double check these things. If I was stretched to give one, my only complaint would be the size of the bed, a twin bed would not suit anyone over 5\" (which is why my mother was perfectly comfortable, whereas me, a healthy 5\"5, seemed to fall out every once in a while - although my mum did mention that the bath was a little on the small side). But for two days, after some ruthless sightseeing, sleeping or bathing was not a problem. Overall a wonderful trip, made perfect by staying at this wonderful hotel, i'm recommending it to all my friends (not the tall ones!), it really is a find and we both agreed that we'd definitely not hesitate to stay there again.

Paid \u00a3300 each including flights, accom b&b from Manchester UK. Got RER from CDG Airport to Gare Du Nord, \u20ac8.70 each one way, a bargain particularly if you get the express. We walked from the Gare du Nord to Hotel des Arts, which was ok as we got into CDG 08.30 local. Stopped off for coffee & croissants on route. Hotel a bit tricky to find as our map was crap, but if you prefer, take the Metro from La Chapelle which is part of Gare du Nord to Blanche (just near Moulin Rouge), turn right once on ground level, head up Rue Lepic, across to Rue Theloze and you are there. Hotel very nice. Small, but clean, friendly, attentive and modern. Only criticism is via my other half who is a very light sleeper...thin walls and can be noisy if you don\u2019t keep the same hours as some of the other guests. I can sleep thru an earthquake so I can\u2019t really comment. Hairdryer in small bathroom, nice firm bed, TV with limited channels mostly European but 2 English News channels, but no tea/coffee facilities in room. Room attended everyday, breakfast is continental...juice, coffee, teas, toast, croissants, muesli, fruit, french bread, cheese, preserves, etc. 7.30 to 10 30 so more than adequate. Can be problematic getting a table to yourself unless you go down ultra early or late, but promotes conversation if you have to share a table. Met some lovely people this way. Re experiencing Paris, get a ticket on the Open Top Tour Bus. Jump on opposite the Blanche Metro station on Rue Clichy. \u20ac32 for 2 day pass; 4 different routes taking in all tourist areas of Paris; hop on, hop off where you like, spend some time, jump another bus and explore another route. A brilliant way to explore the city. Your are given headphones which you plugin with multiple languages onboard providing a running commentary of the sights and history. The Metro is fabulous, cheap and quick but you miss the vistas and commentary provided during a similar journey on the Open Tour buses. Oh, get the bus and you will get to experience the lunacy that is the Parisian traffic! There appears to be no other rule than every man for himself! Bicycles, scooters, cars, delivery vans, buses, coaches, all aiming for the same piece of road at the same time!! If you haven\u2019t experienced it, it\u2019s scary. Watch from the top of the bus while you try to claim a piece of tarmac around the Arc de Triomphe, Place de la Concorde or crossing one of the many bridges!! Food & drink was great eating out. Stay away from the frontline tourist places if on a budget; go a couple of streets back for better value. Look for \"Formula\" , \"Fixe Pris\" or \"Menu\" deals to keep costs down. We paid no more than \u20ac15 each plus wine for very commendable 3 course meal. Now, things to be careful of... Pigalle, Moulin Rouge area is a big red light sex shop area. In our experience it\u2019s not a problem, just another aspect of a foreign city but may offend some people. Walked past the establishments and working ladies every night on way to dinner or hotel, but not pestered...don\u2019t know if that says more about us! Sacre Coeur. If you walk thru Place du Tertre, look out for primarily pick pockets as the square is crowded with lots of brushing past/body contact. Also lots of attention from portrait/caricature painters or silhouette artists mithering for a commission...even if sat in one of the overlooking bistros you are not safe from their persistence. At the front of the Basilica, watch out for African guys trying to get you to sick a finger out for them to tie a friendship bracelet on your hand, then ask for money. A loud \"Non\", or some firm \"Anglo Saxon\" is usually enough to dissuade them. Don\u2019t be pressured. Make noise and they will leave you alone. The Louvre: Girls asking you to read and sign a clipboard for deaf and dumb charities. Again, a total scam so don\u2019t be pressurised, don\u2019t make eye contact, push the clipboard away if thrust at you and a loud \"Non\" will suffice. Believe me, they are neither deaf nor dumb.

I personally prefer a slightly less firm bed and would have liked a usable shower rather than just a bath with shower attachment (but no shower screen), but these are very minor niggles.

Our room (twin) was of a good size,compared to others I've experienced in Europe. Clean and comfotable. The bathroom too was well sized. The hand held shower and lack of a shower curtain was expected due to previous reviews and a bit of a nuisance.There were 3 mirrors including a full length on the door,one in the actual bed room would have been useful. Our room didn't have a view,would have been nice, but it didn't spoil our stay. Despite being next to the lift we were not disturbed by noise from the lift or people using it.We slept soundly with the window open,no problem with noise there either. Breakfast saw a good selection of continental breakfast foods.Did get a bit busy around 8.30, but we were on our way by that time and eating was relaxed. The staff were very friendly and helpful The hotel's location was perfect. Close to the bustle of Montmatre, but peaceful at night. Lots of restaurants to chose from! We dined at two reached by turning right at the bottom of Rue Tholoze,' Zebre Of Montmatre' and 'Le Basilic'. The other was 'Le Templier' left at the bottom,along past Abbesses Metro, on the right side of the street. There is also a Crepe/Sandwich bar just across the road at the bottom of Tholoze with a delicious selection of bagettes,sandwiches,wraps,crepes! A walk up Tholoze from takes you to Place du Tertre and Sacre Coeur.Down Tholoze and on down Rue Lepic takes you to the Pigalle,yes a bit seedy, but The Moulin Rouge is there to be seen or visited.To the left at bottom of Tholoze are restaurants,bars,cafes,food shops,Metro Abbesses station and on to a warren of streets with a myriad of unusual clothes,gift shops and galleries. To the right at the bottom of Tholoze, the road divides.Right, more cafes and shops and right at the end and to the left, Montmartre Cemetery-atmospheric and interesting for a stroll-honest!

Storage space was almost nonexistent, 2 single wardrobes either side of the beds, which consisted of a hanging space which was just about tall enough to hang a shirt or a skirt and 3 narrow shelves, one of which had the room safe fitted into it and the other 2 had spare pillows and blankets. So the blankets and pillows had to be put on the floor with our cases so we could store our clothes away.

Whilst this did not cause any immediate concen, after the third day of no turn-down service (clean towels, sheets etc...) we were forced to return our own dirty laundry to the reception desk and request clean replacements (including more toilet roll!). When we first used the shower there was a problem in that the temerature was fixed at scalding hot. When calling the hotel to ask if they could help they weren't forthcoming with a solution (besides adjusting the temperature dial) until we had left for breakfast and on our return they claimed the problem had resolved itself. This was untrue as the boiler had simply run out of hot water! Fortunately this problem did not continue past day two of our five day stay. The apartment itself was self catered and well equipped (microwave, fridge, kettle, toaster) but did not provide anything more than the equipment. Fortunately there were convenience stores nearby for us to buy tea/coffee etc. As the apartment is on the ground floor we were awoken early every morning by the sound of the postman, people recycling bottles in the backyard of the building and the residents of the apartment building. It must be said though that the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast is served between 7 and 10 in the hotel building. The room is quite small, and on two of the four days we had to share tables with other guests (again, this was not a huge problem for us). On our last day, however, we entered the reception at about 9am to be confronted by a group of agitated guests, who were waiting to go downstairs for breakfast, but there was not enough room. We were asked if we could come back later, which usually would be a problem for us, but as we needed to pack we agreed and went back across the road. Once we had finished packing (and were constantly looking though to the reception area to see when there was no more queue) we went back to the breakfast room at about 945, where there was no food left (other than preservatives, which were useless without anything to put them on!) When we asked if there was any bread, we were told that there wasn't, and no effort was made to go and acquire more (it should be noted that there are numerous boulangeries near the hotel). We mentioned this again when checking out of the hotel, but all we were told was that they were sorry, and made no effort to compensate us in any way (we had paid extra for the buffet breakfast when booking). As we are a young couple none of these points (besides the lack of breakfast on the final day) caused any major problems for us. We simply felt that the hotel did not give us the kind of service which was expected considering we had booked a hotel room with buffet breakfast, instead of us booking a self-catered apartment for a week. The location of the hotel is good, being within walking distance of the Moulin Rouge, two metro stations and the Sacre-Couer.

The tickets said be there at least 30 mins before the 1900 show time - we got there on the dot of 1830 and there was already a queue around the block - dont be put off ! so long as you have a ticket the doors open at 1900 and you are generally sat at your table with a glass of champers in hand by about 1915 - Pleasant walk back to the Hotel via a couple of Bars....again no feeling of tension in the area, certainly when we were there felt perfectly safe and amongst similar minded people Sunday Lunch - Le Basilic ( 4mins from the hotel on the corner opposite Zebre) - After a morning at the Louvre and with a taxi booked for 1600 to take us back, wanted somehting nice but close to the hotel - had seen the name of the place in Zagats and had spied the sign when we were at Zebre the day before so tried our luck ...really glad we did! best meal of the weekend and a lasting memory of the perfect french Sunday lunch - relaxed yet slightly more upmarket than Zebre this relatively small space was crammed with smiling faces and french voices - food was very definetly a step up also and whilst the prices were higher the option of Prix Menu or al a Carte covered all the bases both from a price and qulaity perspective - Grandmas poached egg starter with Garlic shavings was a highlight as was the Hay Roasted Lamb Rack, classic Rossini filet and duck done only the way that the French seem capable of doing.....rolled back to the hotel and onto a cab back the airport and home sharing tales of glutiny and excess but everyone agreed we were very lucky people and wouldnt living in an appartment in Montmatre be a realy good thing to do !!

The hotel itself is charming and extremely clean and pleasant. All of the staff are polite and friendly and more than happy to give help and advice if required. The hotel has a very homely feel. Our room, which was on the top floor (room 61) was clean, comfortable, nicely decorated, cosy and perhaps a little on the small side, but very pleasant.

It seems they have a hard & fast rule about check-in: not until 14h or 2 pm so we left our luggage and walked around and then took the Metro to one of our favorite restaurants for lunch. We returned about 15 minutes before 2 and had to wait, but we were the first allowed to check in. Our room was on the top floor, but the elevator only goes to the 5th floor so we had to walk one flight of stairs-no big issue. Our room was named \u201cGazi Le Tatar\u201d. All of the rooms were named, and each floor was decorated with a Montmartre/Paris theme. Hotel is family run apparently and very clean. They were dusting the lobby while I was waiting to check in. All staircases were winding so there may be an issue if the elevator was out of order for some. Staying on the top floor would also be difficult, if not impossible, for people with walking disabilities or difficulty. Our room was spotless just like everywhere else in hotel. One issue was heat: It could be adjusted but did not go down rapidly due to method of heating-hot water. I didn\u2019t see any evidence of a/c so room could be hot in summer. The room had two windows: a regular one and a smaller one near the ceiling and heater. We kept that one open most of the time to offset the heat. From our room, one could see Sacre Coeur clearly. Looking right, one could see the Tour Montparnasse, weather permitting. I wish we had been on the other side to see the Eiffel Tower, but I have no complaints since I requested a higher room and got exactly that. The room had two twin beds, also as requested. They were pushed up together, of course, as is the custom in France. I saw them adjusting mattresses across the hall so the room can be made up with one double or two twin beds. How efficient! There were very small ledges on each side of the bed. The one by the window had the telephone. The only available outlet in the room that I could find was beneath the other ledge on the side closer to the bathroom. There was a desk with a stool as well as a small garbage can. Another lamp was on the desk plus bright lights above the head of the bed and one on the far wall above the desk. There was a nice but small, maybe 20 inches or 50 centimeters diagonally, television. There were about 25 channels. All were In French except the Arte channel which sometimes was in German. Reception was spotty on about 1/3 of the channels due to satellite signal. They need to add some English news channels such as BBC and CNN; however, one is not in Paris to watch tv, but sometimes it is nice for those who don\u2019t speak French to have some. I speak French and German so not an issue for me. Next to the small ledges by the bed were two narrow closets. One had extra pillows and a blanket; the other had a very small safe. My little notebook computer was too big for the safe so I kept it in my suitcase and trusted them. The bathroom had a sink, toilet, and tub. There was a hair dryer on the wall and 3 mirrors of various sizes. The one that bothered me was the one on the door so I could see my fat self on the toilet! There was no mounted shower but a shower cord. Unlike most French tubs, there was no half glass door so one had to be careful when using the shower extension to rinse off so as to not flood the bathroom. They had very nice amenities which seem to be custom made for the hotel. There was soap, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, hand cream, and a shower cap. One minor complaint is that they did not replace them the second day. I did find the maid to get another bar of soap, however. Everything worked fine. My only comment would be that they should add some safety bars to help getting up and in and out of tub. Tub was not slippery but could be if one didn\u2019t rinse it off before standing up. There was also another small garbage can in the bathroom. As others have said, breakfast area can get crowded. We timed in just right on both days. They had cereal, bread, hard boiled eggs, juices, yogurt, water, coffee, and tea. One addition that could be made would be a few cold cuts such as ham, but no complaints because they probably would charge more than 10 euros if they expanded the selection. The hotel had no wifi although they told me at the desk that some rooms were wired for such based on how they were booked. I am not sure exactly what that meant. There was one terminal in the lobby, but it was often busy. I was able to quickly check my email a few times, but some lingered as if they were extra special. Also, there was a problem checking AOL mail except in the mornings for some reason. There was an error message so not sure why I could not access it during afternoon and evening. I had a family emergency in the US and had to phone for more details since I could not send or receive emails for almost 24 hours. I am not sure if it was the hotel\u2019s connection, server, AOL, or exactly what. In summary, the hotel deserves its high ratings. All of the negatives were things that could easily be fixed. The biggest negative was the heat. I realize it\u2019s an old system, but it would be nice if there was an off switch rather than just a knob to turn so one had to guess if it was on high or low or wait a half hour to see if it cooled off or heated up. I don\u2019t like paying a booking fee (5,50 euros here) but would not let this be a reason to not stay here. The rate of 85 euros for a top floor room with a view and enough room to move about was a real bargain for Paris. This was the third hotel where I have stayed near Montmartre. This hotel was much better than either of the others, the Villa Van Gogh (formerly Best Western d\u2019Esteres when I stayed there in 2001) and the Tryp Blanche Fontaine (see my review for the details), and would definitely be my first choice when I stay in this part of Paris again. I do like to stay in different parts of Paris on my many visits and rarely stay in the same place again, but I would here. Access to the metro was about 200 metres, either east and flat to Abysses or south and downhill to/uphill from Blanche. There were many great restaurants nearby including one of our favorites, Le Buffet on Rue des Trois Freres, where my pictures are on their wall by the wine racks since I\u2019ve eaten there about 20 times and am considered family. Bottom Line: Hotel was quiet and provided a safe, comfortable night\u2019s sleep.

Every single one of the staff were pleasant, multilingual and and helpful if requested. The rooms were about the same size as others I've stayed in while visiting other cities and towns throughout Europe - efficient, but smaller (or larger) than some travelers may be familiar with depending upon their experiences. My room was very clean, and had hand painted art work on the walls. The location was excellent - this was the first time I stayed in Montmarte, and I was glad I chose to stay here and will definately again. I was especially happy with the heating system - I was always warm - something which I cannot say for some other hotels I've visited during the winter months. My only suggestion would be to add shower curtains and a hook for those guests choosing to bathe this way rather than seated or kneeling in the tub. Some suggestions for others - if you will be visiting a number of museums, consider a Paris Museum Pass, which you can purchase online, or at the airport when you arrive or at an Information center. It has many advantages. There are numerous foodstores and supermarkets nearby. As for restaurants, you can turn either right or left as you leave the hotel, and find many excellent places to eat. In Paris, it is common for restaurants to offer 3 courses - entrees, \"plats\" (main dishes) and a dessert course. Typically, you may choose an entree and a plat, a plat and a dessert, or (for a few euros more) an entree, plat and dessert. You may also choose a bottle of wine or a carafe of the \"house\" wine - white or red. In the cafes, they may have beer, either draft or in bottles, usually in view in a cooler along with soft drinks and bottled water. Be aware - food is more expensive in Paris than in other parts of Europe. My favorite restaurant - Les Dix Vins (The Ten Wines). Exit the hotel and turn right. The next intersecting street is rue Abbesses (with MANY restaurants and cafes in either direction). Continue to the next street, rue Veron, and turn left. After 100 feet or so, you'll find the small, storefront Les Dix Vins - often filled with locals. Take your menu decoder with you, because it is a family restaurant and they speak French. The menu is on a small handwritten blackboard and the wines are on a handwritten blackboard on the wall. Everything is delicious - so be bold! As for breakfast, I did not eat at the hotel, as it was a little more expensive than I wanted to pay. However, other guests mentioned that it was good. Local cafes have breakfasts available for a little less money, but you will not have the variety and the coffee will be limited (if you order a black coffee (cafe noir) you will get an expresso. In Paris, it is unusual for breakfast to be included in the price of a room.

Hotel des Arts is cute, extremely clean, the staff is very helpful and the location is perfect if you want to stay in Montmartre. There are however certain things that obviously do not bother many satisfied customers and that I want to mention. First of all, even though the area is very quiet, and the vast majority of clients are polite, you will hear whatever happens in the hallways and in other rooms so prepare to be interrupted in your sleep even if you use earplugs. I rated the sleep quality as poor also because the beds are small and not so comfortable. They also slide left and right but the main thing that bothered me was that there was something about the bed linen (or the bed itself) that would make you sweat, i.e. some fabric did not breathe there. The breakfast (that is extra 10 euros per person btw) is very average, nothing special in it. I also did not understand why the hotel had only a computer with free internet and no free wireless access (you had to pay extra for it too). To conclude: even though it is not an expensive hotel, there are many other hotels in Paris that offer more or less the same package and that cost up to 30% less. I had the feeling that I paid extra because of the high rating here and not because there is more value in this hotel.

There is a lift up to the 5th floor and only a small spiral staircase to the 6th so no problems although if you are like mt husband and don't do small lifts then the 5 floors of spiral staircasing can make you a little dizzy! Although a stop on each floor to admire the artwork on each lift door is worth the climb! It is a quaint hotel (although it has 64 rooms!) and has nice little touches like each room is named after a famous artist. We had a relatively small room but there was enough room for the two of us with hanging space each side of the bed and 3 shelves each, a large desk, bathroom with a bath/shower, sink and toilet which was very clean and looked quite new, also a hairdryer but it was one of these attatched to the wall so ladies if you have long hair I'd suggest bringing your own! There was also a free safe which you programmed your own pin number into (very easy to use and had instructions) and a flat screen tv which had BBC world news. There was also a reading room downstairs with daily papers in most languages, free internet access and a free jukebox! so when you come back after walking all day you can take a paper, sit back in the comfy chairs and listen to a bit of louis armstrong or duke ellington (or one of the many other musical masters!). Breakfast comprised of croissants (and other pastries), toast, jams, bagguette, a selection of cheeses, yoghurt, cerials, orange/apple juice and tea/friut teas/coffee - only continental served but was always plenty of choice and you help yourself! The hotel was situated perfectly for us. A few minutes walk up hill and you were amongst the street artist of place du tetre and the cafes and restaurants and little trinket /souviner shops and also the sacre-coer. A minutes walk down hill from the hotel and you find youself in a bustle of cafes and restaurants and at the moulin rouge! It is also well situated for metro and bus travel but as we only made one trip out of monmartre during our stay to visit the louvre and champs-elese for 10 Euros each we got a taxi as it worked out cheaper and easier! if you do want to use the buses be prepared to change as not all sites such as the louvre have direct bus access. The staff were all very helpful, spoke fluent English and very friendly. Our flight was in the evening so we made use of the luggage room at reception and there is also a trasnfer service to the airport - we booked ours with a separate company which cost 115 euros for return for the two of us but the hotel have a transfer service at 17 euros per person so worth looking into using this - I wish we had have! All of Paris is quite expensive in comparison to the UK, the average pint is 9 Euros and the main street restaurants charge around 17 Euros for a main course but a lot of bars have happy hours between 2pm and 10pm when beers are half price and try and look at restaurants down side streets if you are on a budget as many do 2-3 courses for 10-15 Euros and a carafe on wine for 8.

I was a little disappointed not to have met the 'infamous' Coco the dog (who was away on vac with the owners) as we were missing our own choc lab at home. Breakfast was very good although the eating area can get a little tight when fully occupied. The best part is the location.

There is corner bar across from \" Comfort inn\". 1 pint of beer for 3 euro. & VERY local atmosphire going on!! if you bring your smile, they will give you nice smile & treat you like a local!!!

The location is great because you can literally walk out of the hotel and into a street with wonderful cafes and bars, shops etc and then down the road about 1-2 mins is the Blanches Metro station which takes you everywhere. The room was very clean and up to date with a lovel fully opening window. The bathroom was excellent and very modern. For some reason there was no shower holder or shower curtain, but all the bathroom fittings were very modern and worked well so as long as you are careful in the shower that this is OK. They even give toiletries which is a nice touch and not given in all independant hotels. Check in was nice and friendly, you need to give in your key each time you go out here, but thats fine. I also used as much french as I could when staying here and they appreciated me trying as many other cafes, shops and bars do, which adds to the fun being away from home. Otherwise there is no point being away! Breakfast was OK, I wouldn't go mad about it but what you do get is pretty fresh and as much as you want. The coffee was not so good but then it was from an urn. For the second day we had breakfast in a bakery. Oddly the hotel at check out said we had breakfast both days! This however was taken off the bill when we explained we didn't eat it both days. The TV in the room was nice, a medium size flatscreen, only french channels, so Americans will be disapointed, but then you have to bear in mind you can always stay at the Marriott if you want to imagine you are in Dixyland. Bed was comfy, nice sheets and pilllows good, with a room safe and hangers and closet space a pleanty. This hotel does not have a bar but there is a small vending machine with soft drinks and Toblerones! We went to shops nearby for wine etc anyway. There is a lounge area off reception, really lovely with leather armchairs, large flatscreen tv and jukebox with CDs, free of charge, also a free of charge I-mac for using the net. This was very useful for going online. All in all we had a great stay here and would come back in a shot. It is very hard finding a hotel in Paris that is central and has good standards at a reasonable rate. We did use the booking.com website and this gave a good rate. The Zebra of Monmatre bar and restaurant at the end of the road was fantastic, also there were some other great restaurants further down the road which we visited. Just take a look in the window for the menus, if they seem very french in their approach and full of French people, you are onto a good thing! Avoid anywhere where the menu is translated into several different langauges, you will get ripped off and be eating gunk. If you want a lovely stay in a genuine French hotel with genuine non tourist trash cafes and bars next to it, stay here!", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cPERFECT\u201d", "Author": "051610a", "ReviewID": "UR63079239", "Content": "Lovely little hotel, room was clean & tidy, comfy bed, clean bathroom, plenty of closet space, very well priced, great location, all staff were pleasant & helpful, Caramel is just adorable, we stayed here 6 nights & would love to stay here again if we return to Paris.", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Forest, CA", "Title": "\u201c\"Perfect tiny little room\"\u201d", "Author": "KJoyWright", "ReviewID": "UR62773915", "Content": "Tiniest little elevator, it was you or your luggage.

Within walking distance are the Place du Tertre, the Sacre Couer, Le Lapin Agile - and a choice of two metro stations not far away (don't use Abbesses loaded with suitcases) and we thought it was a great spot. The staff were friendly and helpful, before and during our stay - and the dog is gorgeous! There are plenty of local cafe's in the streets up to and in the Place de Tertre (beware the artists - and flower sellers - pushy doesn't begin to describe it!) and along the Rue de Abbesses. It's not close to the Seine or Champs Elysees, but you can walk it. It is a very compact city and is fun to explore with a map. We walked (mostly) from our hotel, to Sacre Couer, to Notre Dame, the Latin Quarter, to the Louvre, the Place de Concorde and up the Champs Elysees to the Arc de Triomph in one day. It was cold, it rained, it snowed and we loved it! (We did get the metro back!) It is on a steep street though so if you have any problem with knees or fitness - go elsewhere. We loved that it's a busy street, it felt 'French' and that's what we wanted! We were in a triple - and granted the rooms aren't big - but unless you pay way more than we could ever afford, all rooms in Paris are small aren't they? We've stayed in smaller rooms in Paris - and on our honeymoon had the worst bed in the world - but it's Paris! We loved it at des Arts and would love to go back - but next time on the top floors so we can have a view. It seems to me that the main complaints come from USA.

I actually made the reservations for our whole trip so I'm not sure how Karine and my husband managed to pull off the whole thing without my knowledge, given that I could be quite nosy at times. We were given a beautiful room, a great surprise treat on our wedding anniversary and had a wonderful stay. The hotel also has a small area where you can lounge or use the internet which is very helpful. I had also booked the stay for my mother, grandmother, aunt and uncle whose stay at the hotel was a week prior to us. My mom would communicate to me via email (using the hotels computer) and was very pleased because the neighborhood is safe, close to everything and yet the hotel was situated in a quiet location. There are two metro stations close to the hotel which would be Blanche and Abbesses so getting around the city would not be a problem. Sacre Coeur is also a few minutes away which is situated at the top where you can see Paris and all its glory and of course, the Eiffel Tower. One tip that you shouldn't miss though is that starting around 9:00 every hour thereafter (or maybe earlier in late fall and winter). The Eiffel Tower shines with glittery white lights like fireworks (apart from its usual yellowish light) for about 10 - 15 minutes. Where would be a better location to view this spectacle from but from Sacre Coeur. It was our first time in Paris and the stay at the hotel surely made our wedding anniversary trip memorable. Will definitely stay here again in the future. Thank you to the staff of Hotel des Arts.", "Date": "October 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Value": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cA Quaint Hotel In The Heart Of Montmartre\u201d", "Author": "tell_me_all_about_it", "ReviewID": "UR47029319", "Content": "I've managed to find this little gem wonderfully located in the heart of Montmartre & also thanks to Tripadvisor\u2019s many positive reviews, we\u2019d decided to go ahead with the booking & have enjoyed every bit of our stay during Sept 20 to 22. After a long & tiring drive from Germany, upon arrival Karine was there to greet us & directed us where to park our car for the next 3 days.

We've booked a superior room & requested for a room with a view & indeed they live up to our request. The elevator only stopped on the 5th floor, just a short walk along the hallway & up a short flight of spiral stairs to the attic & our room for the next 2 nights, room 60. Although the room was small but it was adequate for us, no air-condition just a window with a great view of low Parisian buildings & the Eiffel Tower from afar. The bathroom was clean, well supplied with a bathtub, a showerhead & a wall mounted retractable clothesline but just one set back there was no shower curtain. The hotel is conveniently located in a very nice & lively neighborhood near to many cafes, restaurants, boulangeries, patisseries, grocery stores & shops. With Sacre Coeur, Moulin Rouge, Metro Des Abbesses & Metro Blanche are just a 5 minutes walk away. Lastly, the hotel provides breakfast at a fee of 10\u20ac/person, unfortunately we didn't try so we were unable to comment on that but they do provide free internet access in the waiting lounge & their pet & mascot a very happy & friendly 4 year old chocolate Labrador named Caramel that greeted the guests when they arrived.

The hotel is in an excellent location, right in the heart of Monmartre. Close to Blanche and Abesses Metro stations. The rooms are small but adequate; the bathroom facilities are excellent, but take note that there is no shower fixed to the wall; it is a hand-held shower head. There are no \"do-not disturb\" signs for the rooms, so expect the cleaning staff to barge in on you if you decide to sleep in past 9am. The continental breakfast is adequate, but it can be hard to find a seat in their small breakfast room. They charge 10 Euros for a continental breakfast. For 14 Euros, you can get a full breakfast at one of the many cafes just down the street on rue Abesses. There were two major annoyances with this hotel: 1) They prohibit the consumption of food in the room, apparently for \"hygenic reasons.\" This is a real shame if you want to sample cheeses, baguettes and other take-out food from some of the excellent shops and restaurants in the area - in the comfort of your hotel room. 2) Our travel iron disappeared on day two of our visit, after the room had been serviced. We thought we had misplaced it. After searching around the room, we went to the reception. Sure enough they had it. They took it because they have had four room fires, caused by travel irons, over the past year. The real problem was that they took the travel iron without telling us, which could be construed as theft. They agreed that they should have told us why they took it, and after explaining to them that we had the presence of mind to turn the iron off before leaving our room, they returned it to us. Perhaps they need to implement an official no travel iron rule.", "Date": "October 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cPicture Perfect and Charming\u201d", "Author": "Solotraveller87", "ReviewID": "UR45686255", "Content": "I spent 4 nites at Hotel Des Artes (thru 9/22/09).

We stayed in Room 21 overlooking the narrow and attractive Montmartre street in early September 2009. While compact, the room was not too small. It was in almost pristine - certainly immaculate - condition, and very clean. Perhaps indicative of the long-since gentrified nature of this beautiful hill-side part of Paris, there is absolutely nothing down-at-heel or bohemian about this hotel. Which is not to say there's no character (though it doesn't have a great deal) - it just doesn't have an iota of the usual grime, wear and tear that passes for character in some hotels! The lobby, funky little lounge, spiralling staircase and surprisingly light and airy basement dining room (in spite of what the photo shows) were in similarly pleasant and appealing condition. There was no air-conditioning that I could see, which would only pose an issue if the weather was oppressively hot - leaving the window that overlooks the street open would mean intermittent noise of occasional passers-by or mopeds. Location-wise, it's just a few minutes walk up to wonderful Sacre Coeur and a couple of minutes to La Blanche metro stop (right by the Moulin Rouge). Within falling distance there's a wealth of bistros, bars and street-side cafes (including the fun and relaxed Cafe des Deux Moulins - which featured in the film Amelie, and does a great burger and fries). The staff were extremely helpful, with one searching the internet for the details to Paris's flea markets for me (there is an online Mac in the lounge for anyone to use, by the way). There is a strange rule regarding food being taken to or eaten in the rooms - so there's no room service. However, we snacked and drank what we liked in our room, unaware of this rule until the last evening without so much as a friendly word from the staff. Two issues I noticed, neither of which annoyed me but I guess they could be noted: in the spotless bathroom of room 21 there is no shower - there is a new showerhead on a flexible tube but nowhere on the wall to which it could be attached and no shower curtain to suggest that it once did hang on it. There wasn't any particular reason that I could see for this arrangement, but at the end of the day, it wasn't a problem in the least. Secondly was the safe. Digital and seemingly new, it was however fitted onto a small removeable shelf within the wardrobe and so would have been easy to take.

Electricity - The electricity was turned off each night at 1am and then on again at 6am. This made getting up in the middle of the night problematic. Stalkers - The hotel is not far from the Pigalle area so there are several men who stand around the entrance of the hotel and will follow you around the area trying to pick you up. We were followed on 3 occasions by young Arab men and harassed for 2 hours. When we returned to the hotel, the men would attempt to enter the hotel and follow us to our room.

I believe it was once a dormitory for the dancers of the Moulon Rouge which is just down the street. It is half-way between Moulon Rouge and Moulon de la Galette, about half-way up the butte. It is a short walk (5-minutes) to two Metro stops on 2 different lines which makes it convenient for tourning the city. It has an unpretentious front entrance on a small quiet street; it is nonetheless only footsteps away from the hustle and bustle of Montmartre. Shops, restaurants, cafes, ATMS and just about anything one could need are literally footsteps from your door. The hotel is small (about 50 rooms) and caters to French and other European travelers but the few Americans who stayed with us were unanimous in their praise. The rooms were clean and the building and lobby were charming. The staff was very helpful and spoke English when our attempts at French became embarrassing. The breakfasts (which are included) were very good and we particularly enjoyed visiting with \"Patrick\" as he prepared the buffet every morning. I lived in France in the 1960s and I think Montmartre has changed very little since the times when Van Gogh, Renoir and Picasso lived and painted here. It is the Paris I remember and we will return.

Everyone at the hotel was accomodating and friendly. We had no trouble with our internet reservation. The room was clean and the bathroom was more than adequate. There was a retractable line over the bath tub for wet laundry and a hair dryer was installed on the wall. (There is a laundromat in the neighborhood if you need one.) Our room had an armoire for our clothes, a small televison mounted on the wall, as well as black-out curtains. We booked a superior room for 3 people. We got a room on the second floor that had 3 twin beds (one had been brought in) which were comfortable. Even though it was a bit tight with the extra bed, that wasn't an issue since we were hardly there. The problem was the street noise. There is no air conditioning. It was hot during our stay and keeping the windows open at night was impossible if you wanted to sleep. Part of the charm of this neighborhood is that it is very lively. We were there over a weekend so naturally the crowds were making a lot of noise as they strolled - perhaps stumbled - around. I used ear plugs to get a good night's sleep. Here's my advice: This is a lovely little hotel that is run by a good staff. If you come in warm weather, get a room in the back or on the upper floors and, by all means, bring ear plugs just in case they can't accomodate you any where else but on a lower floor facing the street. We really enjoyed the neighborhood. The cafes are OK and the restaurants are fine in this area (hey, it's Paris!). If you want something more, there are 3 Metro stops in the general area - Blanche (closest to the hotel), Pigalle (sex shops and strip clubs - ooh la la), and Abesses (lovely square filled with children on the weekend). We so enjoyed exploring all the back streets and small cafes. We've been to Paris numerous times but had never stayed anywhere close to the 18th. We both would stay there again. For Paris, it's a good value. Some additional thoughts: We took the Eurostar into Paris and used the Metro exclusively for our transportaion with no problems. During the ride, you can buy a set of 10 tickets at the Eurostar's bar and avoid all the crowds and the resulting confusion at the train and Metro stations. When we left Paris we went to Charles de Gaulle airport via the Metro and the train. It was much easier than I had expected but beware: lots of stairs. If you have a lot of luggage or are out of shape, this way of getting there is not for you.

The street itself offers peace and quiet from the bustle of the city and is only a five minute walk from the Abbesses metro station. I felt the only thing that kind of nagged us about the location was the fact that you usually had to change on the metro to get to the main attractions, usually after only one or two stops and after taking the RER from the airport we had to change twice with our cases, but other than that, a wonderful location. Also, on our first sight seeing day when we went to the Louvre we got talking in the queue to a single man and a family from England, both staying at different hotels closer to the Louvre in the centre of Paris and both complained about the cost/ lack of value for money that the central hotels offered. The single man had less facilities than us but was paying double the price per night for his room, all to just eradicate five minutes off his metro journey time to the heart of Paris!!!

One of the greatest pleasures of being in France is to buy a baguette and make your own sandwich using the good local produce on offer..,,,or a midnight feast after a few drinks in the local bars.

Bread, croissants, cold boiled eggs, cereals, yoghurts and tinned fruit salad were offered but were neither inspiring nor plentiful. No eggs or croissants on arrival on day 1 and no one seemed to be in a rush to replenish. The latter 2 days we got a Panini down the road for les than 5 Euros which was delicious. On our return to the hotel after our second day of sightseeing we asked for the room key and were told some items had been removed from our room as they had had problems before and would return them when we left. They had removed 4 nightlight candles from the bathroom which I had left on the tiled area of the bath having had a relaxing candlelit bath the previous evening. There was no shower curtain and they were at the opposite side of the bath to the towel holder. What a pathetic attitude towards guests. This is certainly how to ensure you do not get any repeat business as I for one will not be back, even to collect my candles!

Not much of a view (the room across) but I didn't mind. The bed was firm and the bathroom was clean and recently renovated which impressed me. Wake-up calls were easy and reliable. I had the breakfast included with my hotel stay which I enjoyed - a good selection of yogurt, cereal, juice in addition to coffee, tea, croissants and boiled eggs. The hotel is located in the middle of Montmartre - close to shops, restaurants and markets. I fell sick with a cold about midweek and the staff directed me to a local pharmacy to purchase some medication.

I sent another email to the void, then finally called up the hotel. A receptionist told me very briskly that their booking site had been down, which is why she had ignored my emails but that she would be book me a room and send me an email. Several days later, having not yet received email confirmation, I called back and spoke to a different person who confirmed my booking. And, finally, finally, I received email confirmation. After all this back-and-forth for a simple confirmation, I was convinced that no room would be available when we arrived. However, to my relief, all was in order. From that point on, our stay was reasonably pleasant. This is a very basic hotel. It is clean, moderately priced, and quiet. Though the size of the room borders on this side of tiny, it was comfortable after a long day of walking and the bathroom featured plenty of hot water (a plus). Best of all is the location, right in the heart of Montmartre, surrounded by fantastic bakeries, bars, restaurants and public transit options. Montmartre is charmingly \"Amelie-esque\" and an inexpensive yet colourful base from which to explore Paris. Despite these pros, I am not sure if I would return to this hotel. The trouble I had to go through to receive confirmation, coupled with the horror stories posted on this site, really make me wonder if it is worth the effort. This is a shame because the hotel itself is perfectly fine as budget accommodation (in fact, I spent two nights in another budget hotel in Montmartre that was comparatively priced but not nearly as nice as the Hotel des Arts).

They have a bunch of rules like no drying clothes on the radiator, no hanging clothes off the balcony, no eating in room, etc. We broke every rule. I could understand that they didn't want us hanging our clothes on the radiator due to fire hazards and eating would make a mess, so we only hung our clothes while we were in the room and cleaned our mess after eating.

I booked directly through their website, one day before I travelled, and got an immediate email confirmation which I printed out as instructed. They offered me a discount rate - 58 euros per night for a single room, although they sneakily added on a 5 euro \"booking fee\" (a common scam for all kinds of internet business, as it costs them next to nothing to take internet booking). When you add in breakfast - which is often included even at budget hotels - you're not saving a lot of money compared to nicer Montmartre hotels - such as Regyn's or L'Ermitage. I took a risk with this hotel because I knew there were other hotels in the area with rooms available - and I would be arriving early enough to walk out and find another if they tried the swap scam. I arrived in Paris exceptionally early - 7.30 am - and decided to test their reaction by going straight to the hotel. Alain was a bit surprised, but after a bit of negotiation he offered me a smaller room that was already empty - if I would pay an extra 29 euros as an \"early check-in fee\" (they do like their extra fees....) I could have waited until 2 pm for a bigger room - but the offer was too tempting after an overnight journey. In the end I was never charged the extra - Caroline checked me out and I think its obvious they have a communication problem. Clearly it sometimes works to the traveller's advantage! Interestingly, at check-in Alain sifted for ages through several piles of paper and asked me when I had booked (\"Was it two months ago?\"). The same look of slight surprise when I told him I had booked the day before. The room itself was fine but nothing amazing. A comfortable bed, warm and clean, the nice bonus of a television with English channels. My view was of a ventilation shaft, the bathroom was incredibly tiny with a few cracked tiles and a useless hairdryer, although very clean. More or less what you would expect from any decent budget hotel in Paris. Breakfast is a bargain - worth the extra 7 euros as you'd never get so much choice for the same price at a cafe. And the lobby IS very pretty, and the location is excellent. But I'm afraid to say that there do seem to be some dodgy practices going on there. If you are coming to Paris at a busy time of year, or after a long trip from America - or if its a special occasion or a romantic trip - don't risk it. If you have your heart set on staying in Montmartre, save your sanity and book at the slightly more expensive Regyn's or L'Ermitage. I haven't tried Hotel du Moulin or the Utrillo but they're more reliable and the same price as Hotel des Arts. If you don't need to be in Montmartre, try Hotel Chopin - its lovely.

However, I read the reviews on this web site not long before travelling and became slightly concerned. I emailed the hotel and they sent back a swift reply stating that they did not have a policy of switching guests to another hotel and that my booking was confirmed. I suggest that if you are worried about your booking, email the hotel and get confirmation. They were very helpful. I booked two rooms at the Hotel - one for me and my partner and one for my parents. My room was fantastic, with a balcony, reasonable amount of room, decent bathroom, and some limited views. However, my parents' room was considerably smaller, with only an inward looking window for ventilation. It might be an idea to specifically request a room at the front of the hotel with a balcony. Although, these rooms are on the 4th floor and the lift is small and slow. We didn't mind running up and down 4 flights of stairs every time we arrived back at the hotel, but you may feel differently! The only other complaint was that I had booked a double room for my parents, but the hotel put them in a twin room - even though they turned it into a double on the second night (pushing the beds together and double bedding) this was inconvenient and certainly not as comfortable as a double room. However, the rooms were quiet - even my room that opened up directly onto the street was quiet in the evening. And apart from the minor issues raised here, the rooms were adequately decorated, very clean, and generally pleasant. We found the reception staff to be helpful and friendly. Although we speak a little French (badly), the staff all spoke English, and didn't mind helping us out with language issues! The area was picturesque, and easy to navigate, with good access to the Sacre Coeur and easy access to Blanche metro station, although the walk back to the hotel from the Metro is uphill and a bit cobbled - again, not a problem for me or partner, but maybe an issue for older or physically disabled visitors. We found the surrounding area to be very 'young' feeling and met people easily in the local bars. While the hotel is close to Pigalle and is basically half way up the Montmarte Butt, the street it is in does not feel 'red light' at all. I would recommend this hotel, as long as you don't mind hills and stairs.

And there was also a problem throughout Paris with accomodation being available. But never fear - they had found an alternate hotel for us, and would give us money and put us in a cab and send us off on our way. I was seething. I don't speak my mind very often, but on this occasion I couldn't control myself. I told them that I knew that they had a habit of doing this when people arrived, but they denied it. I couldn't believe it. The hotel we ended up going to was fantastic - a brand new hotel called Suite-Hotel near Porte de la Chappelle metro station. The rooms were huge. Unfortunately the location was nothing compared to Montmartre. And because we hadn't already paid the 78 Euro per night rate that I booked Hotel des Arts for over a month beforehand, the new hotel cost us 92 Euro per night (but the 4th night was half price).

Just as an aside, the taxi seemed to take forever to come and collect us, and in the meantime the chocolate labrador decided to hump my fiancee's leg in the waiting area.

Try to book this hotel for a longer stay, and you will feel it ! We booked this hotel at the beginning of September 2004 through a famous travel agent in Tokyo. We booked it for 4 nights, but we only stayed there 2 nights. The first day we arrived, they bumped us to other hotel, which fortunatelly better than this hotel. We thought that this is a little strange, but we still can accept it. They told us to come back to Des Arts at the second day, and we stayed there for two nights. Then at the forth night, the unbelievable thing happened. We still have our luggage being kept at this hotel, but the receptionist said that they don't have any room for us, and bumped us again to another hotel. This time is worse because the hotel was very small, dirty, and certainly the price is lower than what we paid for Des Arts. I noticed there was also another couple with the same condition, and they angrily told the Des Arts' receptionist that they fill like inside pigeon hole. I don't know whether it is usual for hotels in Paris to do this kind of unresponsible thing...", "Date": "September 11, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, PA", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2519914", "Content": "My daughter and I had such a pleasant stay at this lovely hotel.
