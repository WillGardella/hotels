Polite employees, the location is excellent, right next to a big shopping mall with supermarket and food court. Nice, basic breakfast. There is a kitchen in every room, not that I cooked but it's nice to have it just in case.... The bathrooms are renovated. The only thing I did not like is that the hotel is old and you can tell is worn out. The blankets have holes, the sheets and the towels are kind of greyish. I put away the blanket and used only the sheets\u2026. At least they are washed more often (I hope). The hotel is excellent for budget travellers, you get what you pay.", "Date": "June 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North West", "Title": "\u201cAmazingly helpful and friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "DubaiLoverLover", "ReviewID": "UR14645746", "Content": "Just had the most amazing week in Dubai. The staff at the jonrad hotel are just brilliant. They go out of their way to help you and make sure you have the best stay possible. Every morning the staff would clean our rooms and replace everything that had been used. Breakfast wasn\u2019t to my liking but had enough choice, 3 selections of cereal, toast, tea, coffee, various foods. The swimming pool on the terrace is small, but it was nice to splash around in. Isn\u2019t great for if you want a swim. The hotel has quite a nice view from the terrace, although the view from the room isn\u2019t so good (Car park or a wall! \u2013 but how often do you spend there/looking out of the window?!) They also arranged day trips to certain shopping centers or the beach on different days which was helpful. The hotel is in an excellent location in Deira which is close to everything, shopping centre/starbucks/all food places are literally around the corner and across the road. There is a bus stop close to the hotel for you to reach most places, and boats to al nasir square where many souks are. Overall I don\u2019t have a bad word to say about the place \u2013 I felt very welcome and would most definitely stay there again, when you check out the hotel even arrange and pay for your taxi for you.", "Date": "March 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly surprised.\u201d", "Author": "Cazzaw", "ReviewID": "UR13451682", "Content": "The Conrad Hotel is now called the Jonrad Hotel: it is set in the busy part of Deira. The staff are extremely helpful, friendly and eager to please. Rooms are reasonable, everything works, hot water showers etc...they will provide an electric kettle along with teacups etc...free trips are arranged both morning and evening. Mornings to the beach and evenings to different shopping plazas. You can have computer usage in the main reception area for about \u00a31.50 (10dirham) for 1 hour. Breakfasts are very good and everything is neat and tidy. They have a small swimming pool on the roof which provides a wonderful sun trap. The hotel is centrally located: walk out of the front door, turn right and then right again onto the main road which takes you straight up to the Creek which is about 10 minutes away. From there you can get a municipal water bus for 4dirhams to anywhere. Alternatively you can turn right at the creek and walk along for another few minutes to the abra station this costs only 1 dirham to go whereever you wish. We didn't visit the restaurant but I'm sure it would be good value. We tended to eat at the Panorama Hotel next door where they had a marvelous buffet (12 main dishes, 10 salads, 10 side dishes and four desserts) all for the pricely sum of 24 dirhams. You can eat as much as you like. That's about \u00a33.50 per person and everything is excellant. The restaurant is situated on the first floor and on the ground floor is a lively bar - have fun!", "Date": "February 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ripon, North Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat 3 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "do-it-yourself", "ReviewID": "UR10430776", "Content": "Jonrad/Conrad hotel Dubia. This hotel was originally called the Conrad but had to change it's name after being open for a year thanks to pressure from the Hilton hotel who already owned the name. If you look closley you can see that the C has been removed from the front of the hotel and been replaced with a J (very strange). First impresions when you arrive is the area dosn't look fantastic ? but it is handy. Local shops include the Iranian sweet shop, several car hire agents and grocery store. Next door to the Jonrad is the Panorama hotel which is a great place to eat , 3 course buffet 19 Dirams (USD 6/GBP 2). The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Shuttle bus goes daily to the beach and shopping centres. Small swimming pool on the roof of the hotel is small but plesent. Tours of Dubia can be booked at the hotel.
