Just back from a family celebration trip and while we loved the style of the hotel, I would never return. Too loud and noisy and definitley caters to the younger club crowd. We stayed for 4 nights and booked 4 wrap around terrace suites. My husband and I checked in and our room was only 1/2 clean. We had no hair dryer, no food or no mini bar...not a big deal as we would never have purchased anything but the hotel was definitely lacking with housekeeping as it varied every day of what was cleaned and what was not. The rooms are beautiful. But beware, if you are in rooms facing the pool, it will be noisy well into the night as they play club music all day and night (the nightclub extends to the pool area in the pm). What really angered me is they advertise a kitchen. Sure there is a kitchen, but no dishes, glasses, silverware or even a coffee pot! We called the to have one delivered but they don't have any. You must go out for coffee or use room service. Apparently this was built as a condo and they couldn't sell the units so that is why there are kitchens...for looks, not use!!!! Rooms are huge (terrace suite) and beautiful. Very comfy beds. Difficult for the \"older set\" to figure out how to turn on lights , etc. and the use of the phone to turn on lights, etc. is cool, but again, if you not very technologically savy, forget it! The rooms could use more soundproofing from outside. Despite being ont he 37th and 47th floor, we could still hear the music from the nightclub! Uggg... We checked out at 5:00 am and it was soooo loud and full of drunk people in the lobby bar, you would have thought it was 11:00 pm on a Saturday night! We got a great price and location is perfect if you want to be in the middle of the strip. Great restaurant and customer service. However, if you want something a little quieter and more upscale, this is not the place to you. Great if you are in your 20/30's and just want to party.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGet a fountain view room.\u201d", "Author": "Huntsman27", "ReviewID": "UR127000400", "Content": "We stayed for 4 nights recently in a wrap around suite with an adjoining king suite for the kids. Hotel has a central location and you can walk everywhere but can be noisy at times. To be honest anywhere on the strip is going to be noisy but the view far outweighed this. Yes they come with a kitchen but nothing in it. It cost us $11 for 4 plates, bowls, knives, forks and spoons. Not really a fortune but beware the trap. We thought we had booked a fountain view room but were told on arrival that this would be about $60 extra a night for the two rooms. I quickly got over the feeling of being shafted after I saw the view. Worth every cent but again beware. House keeping lacked attention to detail but not a deal breaker. Rooms were clean enough even if they did smell a little of smoke. We checked out over the in house TV system to avoid the long and slow queues of people doing same in the lobby. Just have to ring up and get anything changed if it is wrong. The minibar is automated so every time you move something in the fridge it's charged hence we needed a lot of charges removed from our bill.

There was dust all over the blinds. and one of them you couldn't pull up as the stick had come off. There was no guide to show you how to use the T.V, Lights, phone etc. The shower had no power and just trickled out , the knob was coming off too, and there was no slip mat. The complimentary toiletries were not refilled even though we had used them. The casino was lacking in waitresses which meant you were lucky if you got a drink while playing. One morning waiting 30 minutes just for a coffee while playing on the blackjack table. When you asked pit bosses or dealers they just kept saying \"I'm sure they will be here soon\". None of the casino staff or wait staff in restaurants had name badges which I found frustrating as we were treated quite badly in The Wicked Spoon breakfast Buffet by one of the members of staff. I got the feeling that they have created this beautiful lavish hotel with wonderful rooms but forgotten to pay attention to detail. The service was slow and lacking that little something that made you feel valued as a customer. These small things that were basically attention to detail would have set it apart from other hotels. We did however get offered free wifi in our room and complimentary breakfast & drink in the bar on our arrival and checking process out was a lot quicker. This however would not make me go back.

First, for reasons owing to the recession, the bank that financed the complex on which the Cosmpolitan sits ended up owning and running this hotel. So it operates a little differently than other big-name spots on \"the strip.\" Our room on the 21st floor was intended to be a condo. It was beautiful, larger than most LV hotel rooms and quite tastefully elegant. Best features: a balcony on which we can sit and enjoy the evenings, a deep jacuzzi tub in addition to a larger-than-usual marble shower. The room features convenient dimmer switches and control panels linked to one or both flat screen televisions. Another great feature: One can make reservations at all the hotel restaurants and spas -- from one's room. Like all Las Vegas hotels, rates vary by day of the week and according to the overall demand in town due to conventions, holidays and time of the year. We paid US $190 for the first weekday nights, and the rates jumped to above US $400 for the weekend. We received a US $100 discount of the bill which could be applied to any restaurant or hotel amenity. The hotel is located adjacent to the Bellagio and the Crystal Mall, and directly across from Planet Hollywood and Paris. The location is ideal. The hotel is full of interesting bars and nightclubs. In fact, the internal sightseeing alone is worth the cost. It appears the staff is still working out bugs in the computer system for sending confirming emails, etc., but their general good cheer and helpfulness more than overcomes those deficiences.

Let me start by saying that I do not think I would be so negative about this hotel if my vacation had started off on a good note. We arrived at the hotel at 10pm Vegas time (1am NY time) and waited on line for 30 minutes just to check in. When we finally got to check in, the room I had reserved (and fully paid for in advance) had been given away. I was offered a room similar in size but with one less bathroom and without a view of the famous Bellagio Water Fountains. Not only was I given a room with less amenities, I was charged the same rate as I paid for the better room. To accommodate us, the hotel manager offered a $100 food credit for a restaurant in the hotel. I managed to get a 2 night room credit (instead of food credit) for the 2 least expensive nights of my stay (no surprise there) but was still charged for the balance of my stay at the original room rate. We got to our room 2am NY time to find out that there was no bedding for my son's pull out bed. We called housekeeping and was told it would take an hour for our bedding to arrive! Other problems with the hotel were that the mini fridge was never restocked during our trip, housekeeping didn't clean our room every day and to get to the hotel restaurants, shops etc you had to walk through the casino which always smelled like smoke even during the day. Some of the other hotel casinos do NOT smell like smoke. When booking rooms, the hotel should put guests with children in the part of the hotel where walking through the casino is not necessary to get to the restaurants and other hotel amenities. Despite my problems with the hotel, the restaurants are excellent and the foods are diverse (the service is slow so give yourself plenty of time if you are catching a show) and the room is very modern (no drawers just a closet and some shelves) with some very nice high tech amenities and a beautiful bathroom.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cShocking & Disturbing Experience\u201d", "Author": "Alexjrosen", "ReviewID": "UR126687311", "Content": "I previously reviewed the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas and gave it the highest rating possible. Since writing that review, I stayed at the Cosmopolitan again in January and on two occasions in February. My final stay ended with an experience I found shocking and extremely disappointing. I checked into the Cosmopolitan for what was my fourth stay in four months on February 26. I stayed seven nights, but intended to stay longer. When I checked in, I added my partner to my reservation so that he could obtain keys, etc. during our time at the Cosmopolitan. On March 4, I had to fly to New Orleans for work but planned to return the following night. I left my partner at the hotel for the evening. When I landed in New Orleans, I received a call from him. He was upset and stated that hotel security had come to our suite regarding the bill, saying that my card on file was not going through. I knew this was a mistake as I had seen an authorization from the hotel that morning. What disturbed me is that no one from the hotel contacted me to discuss this matter; instead, they went to my suite and began demanding payment from my partner. I spoke with the resort manager on the phone and was quite taken aback by the way he was speaking to me. I should note: the Cosmopolitan is part of Marriott's Autograph Collection. I am a Marriott Platinum member with over 400 nights at Marriott and Ritz Carlton hotels. Aside from that, this was my fourth stay in just three months at the Cosmo. The fact that I was being spoken to like someone running out on his bill was obnoxious to say the least. To make a long story short, the balance was paid by a different card. Shockingly, however, the manager photographed my partner and banned him permanently from the property. For what possible reason was this necessary or justified? I believed this hotel was five-star. This experience, however, was clearly not characteristic of a five-star hotel and was extremely disappointing. I spend more nights of the month in hotels than my own home and I am nearly always at a Ritz-Carlton, Renaissance, or Omni. I have never had such an insulting experience at a hotel and as a result I do not recommend the Cosmopolitan to anyone expecting a higher level of professionalism or service. In three months, I spent over $10,000 at the hotel and more than twice that at the Cosmo's casino. This is how the hotel treats its regular guests?

We got a pretty good deal through Vegas.com which gave us an upgraded room from standard to a suite with wrap-round balcony. Note: the upgraded room did NOT include the premium view over Bellagio lake, but an extra $60 for two nights made that happen. Room was quite spectacular, although some of the furniture is already showing signs of too many parties (stains on upholstery and chips out of wooden chairs!). We loved having two full bathrooms, and the inclusion of a washer and dryer in the suite was great even though we didn't need them. Tiny irritating details: the hotel prides itself on the array of snacks and drinks it provides in the rooms...we had nothing in ours - not even a bottle of water. The mini-bar was not stocked. In fairness, as soon as we asked for it, someone came up and stocked things fully. Be aware that every item (including those on the tray in the kitchen) sits on a pressure pad - even if you only lift it up to look at ingredients, you will still be charged for it...don't lift it up unless you're sure you want it. (You can easily wander across the pedestrian footbridge from the second floor to Walgreens and pick your own snacks and drinks from there...much cheaper and great selection). My other pet peeve - and this really doesn't affect everyone, but seemes to have become a common factor in every hotel we stayed in - the trash cans have no lids...and there are no \"disposal bags\" provided...ugh! Only an issue for us ladies, but still...nasty. The hotel's own website does not do a good job of describing their restaurants. We booked for a romantic Silver Wedding dinner in the tapas restaurant, Jaleo. We assumed gentle guitar strumming in a rustic atmosphere. No - it was loud, bright...more like a bar than anything else and, like several of their other restaurants, it is open to a central area - thus increasing the noise of the people going past, or meeting other groups there. The food was average - I've certainly had far better tapas in other places, although the wait staff were very sweet. My recommendation would be to book via the hotel, and check which room you have - if you want one with a view you'll have to request it. Note that overlooking the fountains, while spectacular, is also noisy as the water cannons shoot off into the early hours...and you can hear them over the music! Check reviews of the restaurants on Open Table, as most are bookable via their system. It's a fun place, and we had a great time.

We chose this hotel for several reasons. 1) Its relatively brand new, opening in 2008/2009 compared to the majority of the hotels which have been around for over a decade or even more. 2) We also like the fact that it wasn't a tacky themed hotel yet it still had casinos (not that we gamble) so we could experience that Vegas feel in the hotel. If I'm not mistaken the Madarin Oriental is the only other non-themed hotel on the strip but also doesn't have any casinos. 3) Its one of the best placed hotels (other than the Bellagio itself) to see the famous Bellagio fountains. Its also fairly central and easy to walk to everywhere on the strip. Anyhow, moving onto the hotel itself. Its clearly been cleverly designed to fit into the available space because there is no grand entrance which leads onto the strip like most other hotels that have been there for a while, especially the Bellagio. The main entrance where cars etc pull into and the concierge is located is actually underground with a smaller entrance leading onto the strip in the front. The reception area is impressive with tall glass columns towering over everything depicting an electronic library which changes images regularly. Unfortunately check in time took a while but from our experience of the process we put the delay down to the friendly and thorough procedure. As it was our honeymoon we thought we would try the old cliche of trying to get an upgrade. We already had a 1 bed studio booked but we wanted something with a balcony overlooking the Bellagion fountains which costs more and they were more than happy to accomodate us for free. Our room was on the 86th floor. Our room was ridiculously spacious and hightech with a separate living room area, flat screen tv, huge bedroom with another flat screen tv with all lights controllable from the phone system, a his and her wash basin, separate toilet and a wet room and huge bath tub. Double french doors lead onto a balcony with a great view of the whole strip and beyond. A small kitchenette with a small fridge which electronically weighed everything in the fridge and automatically charged you if you removed anything, and a smaller hamper of items which you can purchase like a mini binoculars, condoms and other questionable items??? Anyhow we did have a rather unfortunate even on day two which some may say warrants one less star in the rating. We were awoken on our first morning by drilling noise every half hour which we also recorded on our phone. Suffice to say we immediately complained and although to be honest the noise wasn't hugely disturbing, we wished to bring it to managements attention because it wasn't what we expected on our first morning. Unfortunately we had to speak to various levels of management 3-4 times over a period of 24 hours before we eventually mentioned it to a maintenance man we passed in the corridor and he raised it higher up before it got addressed. Unbelievable, we found a huge hamper in our room, several vouchers to be used in the hotel and \u00a3100 off our final bill and a hand written letter from the maintenance man (not management) as an apology.

This is a place where I have gambled and enjoyed the nightlife many times before. I asked the Front Desk if I could get a room near the elevator, they were unable to accomodate my request and gave me a room basically near the end of the hall. Upon entering my room, the smell of old fish was overwhelming. I also found white pills and a piece of old bacon next to the bed. I called the front desk and told them, and asked once again to be moved, only to be placed on hold for an extended period of time. Instead of just moving my room, they insisted that the housekeeping manager come up to see it first. After waiting 40 minutes, the housekeeping manager was still nowhere in sight. I called the Front Desk once again and was told there was no request for housekeeping to come. They entered a new request and finally after a total of 50 minutes of waiting in my pill infested stinky room, the housekeeping manager showed up. She agreed that the room smelled like dead fish and was shocked at the bacon and pills. Her response was that \"people party hard during the weekend, so the rooms are always a little messy on Mondays, lots to clean\". She then called her manager, who called the front desk to get me moved. After waiting another 20 minutes or so a bellman came to my room to move my stuff. He explained to me that over 20% of the housekeeping staff was recently fired and they are having a lot of problems. I was moved to a nicer, cleaner room overlooking the Bellagio Fountains. That night while laying in bed, I attempted to use the remote to turn off my tv. It did not work. I called the front desk once again and a maintenance man came up. He explained that the remotes do not have good range and I need to get out of bed to turn off the tv. Unacceptable. The housekeeping also failed to replenish towels, and toiletries during my second day of the stay. My biggest complaint about this hotel is that the staff just didn't care.

The concierge saw the note in the system and stepped away a moment to get us the best possible room to fit my criteria. Mind you, we stayed there last week which is Spring Break. He put us on the 47th floor. All I can say is WOW. The view was absolutely picture perfect. We had complete view of the Bellagio Fountains, but unlike someone staying at the Bellagio we were able to stand outside and REALLY experience it from a birds-eye view. The room was impeccable. There were two full bathrooms, a washer/dryer (which really came in handy), fun books on the coffee to glance through, wonderful decor, I was honestly more than completely satisfied with this room. We ordered breakfast to the room two times, and both times they were on the dot. I asked for 7:00 a.m., they were there at 7:00 a.m. sharp. The food was also amazing! I honestly have no complaints. The only thing you have to watch out for is the fridge/mini bar (which they warned us about at check-in). Everything is electronic, therefore if you simply pick up an item from the fridge/mini bar, it automatically charges you. We knew this could be a problem when we noticed that simply opening the fridge door makes the items on the door jumble and move. We had a few items from there but on our final bill was a $30 bottle of wine that we did not have (and clearly was still in the fridge). We told the lady at check-out and she immediately refunded it.

I arrived early and was put on the \"q\" system (?) to notify me via cell phone when my room would be ready, but the system didn't notify me. No matter, when I returned later in the day the concierge let me know the room had been ready for a while and keys had already been activated so I could go up any time. Room was spacious and well equiped, with a dishwasher, microwave, small fridge/minibar, sofa, safe and plenty of closet space. Bathroom had whirlpool tub, large shower with seating and separate toilet area with a door. Rooms are new and still in great shape, with a friendly modern decor. I didn't use the pools or the spa, eat, drink or even game at the hotel, as the sports books are tiny in comparison to nearby properties and woefully understaffed for the sports madness of this particular weekend. What little sitting space there was in the sports bars were \"reserved\" and there was actually no way to stay and enjoy the games unless I procured one of the bar stools early in the day and planned to stay for the duration...Cosmo would do well to follow the lead of PH across the street and open up a Convention Hall exclusively for Madness Attendees in future years or make some separate sportsbar space available exclusively for hotel guests. On Friday Evening I was honelstly overwhelmed by the streams of well dressed young men and women streaming through the casino...not sure which clubs they were headed to, but this is definitely the hotel to stay at if you want to experience the latest version of Las Vegas reinvented. It's definitely not my scene, I still miss the Desert Inn, but is interesting to watch the young and the restless post-millenials wandering about in their new habitat for an evening. If I was 25-40 and single I would definitely stay at this hotel again. Young couples would also enjoy the lively vibe of the casino and bar areas. I enjoyed the serenity of my room and balcony, but I have to admit, a couple of the elevator rides with the groups of scantily dressed club bound ladies actually made me a little uneasy and left me with the profound sense that I actually do prefer the peace and serenity of the Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental to the hip party vibe at the Cosmo. At this point in my life, the prowling days are definitely behind me, but I can still appreciate the overwhelming beauty of this property and the hoards of happy hipsters that take full advantage of all this hotel has to offer. Nice digs and definitely worth the price of admission.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cHot & Cold\u201d", "Author": "Ssleepy", "ReviewID": "UR126367383", "Content": "Just back from 3 night stay over the weekend during \"March Madness\". First, to help readers take my following review for what it is and how it pertains to what the reader is looking for in a stay in Sin City, a little bit about us....We are in LV 3-4 times a year to primarily enjoy gambling and fine dining. We usually stay at either Wynn/Encore or The Bellagio. Location is very good, direct walk-ways to Aria and across the street over Las Vegas Blvd. Right beside Bellagio, across the street from Planet Hollywood and very centrally located to most of the main action. Check-in wait time was about 5 minutes and the agent was approriately proffessional but it would've been nice to seem him crack at least one smile. We arrived at the hotel early, 10am, so the room was not ready (never had this problem on previous visits) but this was not unexpected and was acceptable to us. We were given blank key cards and told that when a room was assigned the keys would be activated remotely so we could just go straight to the room and not have to visit the frontdesk again. Room was ready approximately 2 1/2 hours later, which was totally fine with us. However, the room keys did not work and an additional trip down to the frontdesk was required, not acceptable. The room, Terrace Room, on the 34 floor, facing the Bellagio fountains and Las Vegas Blvd. has got to be one of the best views in Las Vegas. The room was clean, adequately supplied with excellent toiletries and supplies. No complaints and we were pleasantly surprised since we read some of the negative comments about cleanliness on Trip Advisor's reviews. Room is not sound proof to the Bellagio's fountain show and you definitely can hear it but it was not anything that hindered our sleep by any means. The temperature and thermostat worked perfectly. The shower's water pressure was a little too low for our liking. The decor in the room and hotel is chic and trendy and artsy in a fun whimsical way. Other than wine and water glasses, no other dishes etc. in the kitchen. Microwave, dishwasher, sink, fridge, and bare kitchen cabinets and drawers......Total waste of space IMHO. The balcony was a great bonus as we had friends up to our room one night and enjoyed a pleasant after-dinner drinks and get together in the room watching the Fountain show and the activity on the Strip. This is one thing we both wished the other hotels we had stayed at had available. Eventhough our room was clean during the first day, housekeeping service was not consistent. Our room was cleaned everyday, and the first day the room was done properly, but the second day, all they did was empty the garbage cans and make up the bed. Towels, toletries, sinks/toilets/counter in the bathroom were not touched. A $10 tip was left each day for the housekeeping staff but this didn't guarentee that an acceptable job was always done. Dined at MIlos ona busy Saturday night....impeccable, unobtrusive friendly service and the food was excellent. If you enjoy the freshest of seafood, cooked to perfection than I strongly reccommend this place. Chandelier bar and the bar by the front desk were great, no problem finding a place to sit, and the cocktails our wonderful. Spa was nice and the massage service was very good. Facilities were more than adequate and prices for services were comperable to other spas on the Strip. Casino is small and if you like enjoy slots than you will probably be better off going next door to Aria or Bellagio. Tables tend to have a higher minimum bet but it's more of a problem that there arent more tables/slots available to play. Casino staff and dealers were friendly and polite. Hotel guests generally appear to be 20-somethings looking to party (and still learning how to properly hold their liquor in a lot of instances) Not really any families with children staying here which is nice thing. You will likely love this hotel if you are younger, and enjoy the clubbing and nightlife that Vegas does so well. If you are looking for more of a family-oriented hotel, or want something a little more sedate or quiet atmosphere with possibly an older more well-heeled crowd than this place is not for you.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid, Spain", "Title": "\u201cGreat rooms and location, awful service\u201d", "Author": "FGE04", "ReviewID": "UR126345551", "Content": "The hotel is quite new and you notice it.

I was really pleasantly surprised at how AWESOME, NICE, and FUNCTIONAL the Cosmopolitan was! In chronological order....the parking situation was so much better (more east coast?) than the last place (no names, figure it out) -- no valet needed, just pull in and park, for free, and near the elevator (west, right underneath the front desk). There were lights above each parking space indicating available -- awesome!! The big Shepard Fairey (mm hmm) mural in the elevator area was a great visual to orient myself each departure/return. The guy at the front desk was great - quick, to the point, knowlegeable (also a New Englander, accent a dead giveaway) and helpful. The elevator to my floor was basically behind me at check in (love it!), and the room was far enough / not too far from the elevators. The balcony suite I had as part of a work group was GREAT!!! Granted, I was there alone, so the fact there's not much dividing the sitting area from the tub/sink/shower area was not a problem. The mini kitchen would have been nice had I needed to use it...would have rather had a real mini fridge than a real dishwasher tho (they adjusted the charge from when I put an apple in the fridge and it bumped a $5 can of Coke). Very nice to have a sliding door to a little balcony, even tho I didn't use that much either. Lighting/TV/music/alarm again was very hi-tech, but I guess beats turning each thing all around the room on/off by hand (?). I won't fault the place for the screaming and banging that went on in the hall and nearby rooms from 2am to 3am (despite the fact I had to be at work at 6:30 the next morning...not their fault, it is party central)...just sayin', it happened. After a discussion with whomever took my not-pleased call the next day, the following night there was silence, and/or I slept like a baby in the really great bed. Minor complaint re cleanliness - maybe no one had stayed in my room for a while, but there were some dustbunnies, candy wrappers, and other indicators it wasn't as clean in every corner as it could be -- then again, it was a pretty big room. Overall, the place feels like someone had a good sense of humor, as there are visual gags every where you look. There's a great variety of food options, and some unparalleled people watching. I'm sure if you're there to party, the various bars and lounges are as great as they look. I thank AllSaints for momentarily resetting my jadedness. If I should ever go back, for fun or for work, I do hope it's to the Cosmopolitan. And, I hope it never loses its sense of humor!", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201cLost chance, could do better\u201d", "Author": "fraugast", "ReviewID": "UR126247506", "Content": "The valet parking area and the lobby are very impressive, as is the room at first sight. Unfortunately this favorable impression was quickly dimished by a closer inspection of the room. The room was incredibly dirty, especially the white carpet, but also the furniture had not been dusted for a while and there was hair in the bathtub. The carpet was kind of greyish and full of lint and crumps. We had booked a one bedroom terrace suite for four people. At check-in our children were present and we expressly asked the check-in clerk for a room with a pullout sofa and were told that our room would have one. Also, after having read about the noise issue with the night club we asked for a quiet room and we were also told that this would be the case. When we arrived at the room we immediately noticed that there was only a kingbed, but the sofa could not be pulled out. When our luggage was brought up to the room we asked the bellboy how to pullout the sofa, he tried and then confirmed it wasn't possible but he would notify housekeeping. When we went out an hour later we hadn't heard from housekeeping and, just to be on the safe side, went to the concierge desk to let them know that there were neither beds for the children nor towels, nor was there any shampoo at all and that the room was incredibly dirty. The lady at the concierge desk promised to take care of everything. Two hours later, around 09:00 p.m., when we returned to the room, nothing had changed, no beds, no towels, no shampoo and a filthy room. We called housekeeping again and were suddenly told that two rollaways were not allowed in the room!!! I couldn't believe my ears. Next we called front desk and asked them to sort out the matter, as it was getting later and later and our children had fallen asleep on the kingbed and my husband and I were not really keen on sharing our bed with the children. Instead of telling housekeeping to bring two rollaways they offered to relocate us to a standard double queen room!!! Again I couldn't believe my ears. We had booked and paid for a one bedroom terrace suite and they wanted to put us in a queen room! I asked to speak to a manager and was transferred to somebody, I am not sure it was a manager, but the person promised to instruct housekeeping to bring us two rollaways. Nothing happened, except for a call from the frontdesk about 10 minutes later to enquire whether the rollaways had arrived, which they had not. About another 10 minutes later there was a knock on the door and we thought the beds would arrive. But no, when I opened the door there were two ladies from housekeeping standing there and asked to inspect the room because housekeeping had brought up the beds earlier this afternoon and they couldn't believe they were not in the room. This was the point were I freaked out, what were these people thinking, that we were stacking rollaways in the room and making fun of housekeeping? It was absolutely ridiculous. After I had yelled and shouted at them and they had convinced themselves that there were no rollaways hidden in the room, but two children sleeping in our bed, they brought two rollaways after another 10 minutes. It was a really bizarre experience. The next morning we even got more towels and shampoo. Luckily we had brought a little bottle of shampoo from a previous hotel, otherwise we would have had to wash our hair with the conditioner which was there in abundance. The problem of the dirty carpet did not get solved, I understood why when I observed housekeeping cleaning the hallway floors. They had little roller dustpans and brooms which they used to clean the floor. Obviously a 5 star hotel like the Cosmopolitan cannot afford vacuum cleaners. The carpet in our room was really sticky, five minutes after taking a shower the feed of our children were grey again. After we had got the rollaways and everybody went to bed we noticed noise coming up from the night club. We were on 61 floor, but the music and the basses were clearly audible and it was really, really loud, not just a faint background sound. Why did we ask for a quiet room and why did they tell us we would get a quiet room??? Apart from the above the stay was ok, but it is rather a hotel for young, party type of people. In the pool area loud music was playing all day long. There were hardly any umbrellas, unless you were willing to pay 75$ for a sunbed close to the pool, these came with an umbrella. We had breakfast and dinner at the Wicked Spoon buffet, the food is excellent, certainly above the average Las Vegas standard. Upon checking out via our TV set we found out that we had been comped the first night. A gesture by the hotel which was overdue, but it would have been appreciated if somebody from the hotel management had called us and apologized for this circus they had performed on the first evening. Not a hotel where I would stay again or recommend to a friend.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful rooms and views but TERRIBLE service.\u201d", "Author": "dorko135", "ReviewID": "UR126247239", "Content": "Booked this room with my fiance for a 5 day vacation. Drove in from Phoenix and took our time getting to the hotel because we figured it would be busy at the regular check in time.

Once we got to the front, the guy told us that our room would be ready shortly. I asked what shortly meant.. 30 minutes or 2 hours, to which he replied \"shortly\". We went back about an hour later and our room STILL wasn't ready, in fact, they hadn't even started. They gave us $100 to spend on food at the hotel as compensation. When we finally got up to the room we found a bottle full of cigarettes on the porch, one of the porch doors didn't open, blood on the wall in the master bathroom and the main phone didn't work. They never cleaned up the blood or fixed the things that needed fixing. They never replenished the amenities that were used in the bathrooms. Again, the service was TERRIBLE. Room service menu items were tasty but they charged a $10 delivery charge (in addition to a fixed gratuity) for items that you paid more for because they're convenient. Ridiculous. We decided to use our $100 credit at STK because we're Texans and we love steak. I orderd the ribeye and my fiance ordered the bone-in filet. We also ordered the corn pudding and the brussels sprouts for the sides, which were AMAZING. His filet was delicious and my ribeye was very unevenly cooked. The edges were MR and the middle was MW, which isn't something I realized until my fiance was already done with his meal. I told the waitress and showed her my steak and the only thing she offered was an apology. I didn't get another steak because I would be starting my meal all over again and after my fiance finished his meal. Ended up paying for a meal that I didn't even eat, in a hotel that offered crappy customer service. As pretty as the hotel is and as great as the views are, I will not be staying there again.

Most of the other hotels have a single line & you are helped by the next reservationist when you are next in line. So why would Cosmopolitan adopt a supermarket-like check in? Ridiculous. Well it wasn't all bad. When it was finally our turn I expressed my extreme frustration. The reservationist upgraded us for an additional $20 to a much better suite than we were originally booked to. Just goes to show that you have to speak up if you want compensation for your pains. The suite was lovely and sophisticated. Colors were grays & silver with touches of bright color. In the living room was a couch & a couple of chairs & a desk. The kitchenette area had a tiny fridge & a microwave. It would have been nice if there were at least 2 plates & two sets of utensils in the cupboards (which were totally empty). Altho we had a cool place to keep our doggie bag after dinner, we had to eat with fingers the next day! I get it... they want you to spend money in the restaurants instead of eating in your room. The area joining the living room to the bedroom was a very large gorgeous mirrored closet with a bench in the middle. Felt like a movie star! The bathroom was a dream (did I mention the Japanese soaking tub with a view of the Bellagio fountains?). The bed, pillows & linens were wonderful. There was a good-size balcony where you could actually sit outside in nice weather. What a treat to see the Bellagio fountain show every hour! We were there in December so it was too cold, but I can imagine that it would be delightful on a warm summer evening to sit outside & watch all the activity on the Strip.

I had previously stayed at Aria and Four Seasons and wanted a comparable option. This was NOT it. Despite reading numerous online reviews about poor service I did see reviews that said this was the current 'hot' spot and it was rated 5 stars so we thought we'd try it. When we arrived on Saturday afternoon at 3pm (the said check in time) we were told our room wasn't ready. They called two hours later to say the room was now available. 5:00pm seemed late for an arrival but the front desk staff told me '3:00pm isn't guaranteed.' The keys they gave us to our room didn't work so I called down and was told they would bring new ones up. After waiting a while a bellhop saw us in the hallway and said it would be 'faster for us to go down to the desk and get new keys ourselves'. He told us this has been an issue since the hotel opened and he'd seen guests wait for 30+ minutes. Front desk was apologetic and gave us $100 food credit. Room was beautiful - we'd booked a 'wrap around suite' and were initially thankful for a room that overlooked the front of hotel and the Bellagio water show. On our way out that night we rode the elevator with a security guard who had a wheel chair - on his way to 'get a drunk kid who drank too much and couldn't walk'. While in the elevator we heard another call over his radio that someone had vomited in the high play lounge. Said they'd had a lot of that recently and that he was glad he wasn't responsible for the clean up. When we came back to our room at midnight we could hear the music from Cosmo's club below. We were on the 34th floor so had not expected this to be an issue. With doors closed and locked music was so loud we couldn't sleep. At 1:30am I went down to ask about moving or when music would stop. Was told club closed between 4:00 and 5:00am. Was also told 'rooms were sound proof and it shouldn't be an issue'. Resort manager was nice but couldn't do anything. She said the club was attracting 'rich spring break kids from California' which is why it felt more like a bad college spring break experience than a 5 star hotel. I was assured the hotel would contact me the next morning so that we could switch rooms. Hotel didn't have a new room for two days. They called at 2:00pm on Monday (we were leaving at 5am Tuesday). We initially declined move since we were leaving. At 11:00pm Monday club was so loud again we called downstairs to ask to speak with resort manager. Left message and was told he would call within 10 minutes. 30 minutes later no call back so we called again - just wanted to have him come up and hear the noise. No way this was sound proof... thought maybe they'd never heard for themselves. Manager said he could not step away from front desk. Offered to have security come up. We ended up changing rooms at midnight. Overall - rooms were nice, but no way this is a 5 (or even 4) star hotel. Staff is overwhelmed and not empowered to rectify situations. Lots of apologies but no action or willingness to rectify situations. Maybe if you are 21 and looking for spring break place this is your hotel.

He was really trying to be nice, but, as all I wanted was my key so I could get to my meeting, it was a bit insensitive of him to ask \"and when is your first meeting?\" in between the 40 million other questions he asked. He also tried to get some more money off me by trying to sell me a room upgrade....looks like he was the only one trying to get money from me, but more of that later. They are really trying to be high tech with the personalised name on the key cards, but they took an eternity to print. Not off to a great start. The room itself was huge (and just a standard), the bed was comfortable, fab towels and things like shower gel (unusual in most North American hotels) was a nice touch. Large TV which seemed to have a mind of its own and a very high tech phone which had every button on it, bar the one for reservations that I wanted. So the room was good. Now I mentioned I am sitting at the airport. I have a 9pm flight and I wanted to have the room (11am check out - ouch) until about 6pm so I could be finish off some work and be relaxed for the long flight home. So I called to see if I could pay for late check out. The \"instant service\" button then connected me to someone else and the phone rang for an eternity. Then the person who answered asked to call me back. So I asked \"how much to extend my check out\" ..... can I put you on hold. On hold for a bit and the reply was, \"I don't have the list, can you call back in the morning\". Not, \"I'll call you back in the morning\", or \"it is normally about $60 or whatever price\". Just, well, I don't really care about serving you. I decided that as the hotel didn't want my money that I wouldn't bother with the late check out. I also wasn't going to risk physically checking out and used the system on the TV. At least that worked smoothly. And for the closing experience. I dropped my bag off for storage. And my lasting memory of this hotel will be of the guy at baggage who didn't say \"hello\", \"please\" or \"thank you\" he just grabbed my tag out of my hand and more or less threw the bag at me.

I have stayed at the Cosmopolitan both last Summer and in early March. The hotel is, in a word, perfect. Immaculately clean. The attention to design detail is amazing - from the registration area with video elevators, the finishes and lighting in hallways, the multitude of custom wall coverings in the room (even in the closets) and the recurring subtle theme of circles/bubbles, the artwork, the chandelier bar. Everything is just perfect. Artsy and yet comfortable. You absolutely want to pay the upgrade (or ask nicely at registration) for a north view of the Bellagio fountains. The setting with the fountains and Paris' Eifel Tower and the rest of the strip receeding into the distance with the mountains as a backdrop is classic Vegas. The rooms are huge. Some come with kitchens - although you won't find plates or utensils. I believe the property was originally designed to be condos until the market went kaboom and they shifted to hotel rooms. Another nice benefit of this is that I was told that they didn't originally plan for a casino so theirs is linear and relatively small compared to the cavernous winding expanses of Caesars or Bellaggio. Plenty of tables and very classy. I'm not a huge gambler and I appreciated the more intimate atmosphere at the Cosmopolitan. The staff is excellent and accommodating. The \"Day Club\" pool scene is, well, just what you would want from Vegas. Barely clad buff 20-30 somethings, a great DJ, cabanas with glass sided hot tubs, bottle service, and a few blackjack tables to help you pass the time. They also have a large \"normal\" pool area that is quite relaxing. The Marquis Nightclub is one of the hotter tickets in town. It is much smaller than Pure at Caesars, and no where near as ornate. Depending on your mood, this can be a good thing. If you want to \"be seen\", The Marquis may not be your spot. If you want to have a great time with friends and dance your butt off - this place is perfect. Our group got a VIP booth and table with bottle service and the attendants were unbelievably attentive and engaging. They were also unbelievably hot. both male and female. Lastly, the restaurant options at the hotel are great. I have been disappointed in many of the other Vegas restaurants transplanted from LA or NYC. All the food at the Cosmopolitan was exceptional. STK was great. China Poblano didn't look like much from the outside but the food was fantastic. And Milos served what is probably the best meal I have had in Vegas. Lastly, the great high end shops at City Center are just steps away and even if you are not looking for that perfect Hermes Berkin bag in blue ostrich, its worth walking through just to see what retail stores can look like when their construction budget is unlimited.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cALMOST perfect...\u201d", "Author": "FreddyTwoHands", "ReviewID": "UR125953029", "Content": "I would've given 5 stars, but our last visit left a bland taste in our mouths, with a bad experience at check in AND at STK, we just didn't have the usual GREAT stay. I have been a FAN (and LOYAL customer) of The \"Cosmo\" since it opened in late 2010, readers, you have to realize that this place was supposed to be a condominium complex but went bankrupt and got bought out and redeveloped into a swanky casino/hotel.. This = BEAUTIFUL rooms with pretty odd/overblown amenities.. FULL size sub zero refrigerators with FULL size washer and dryers in SOME rooms, built in wine cooler/chillers, dishwashers, huge balconies in almost every room (except in their smallest rooms which are the ONLY one's that are actually like \"regular\" hotel rooms), all the lights and the climate in the rooms can be controlled from your tv remote control (very nice). I have to say that if you're traveling with minors/children I suggest that you not stay here, this place is intended for the \"seen and be seen\" crowd, I'm born and raised in Los Angeles, and I have to admit that in my opinion the people watching here on a good night rival's Hollywood any day of the week, this is a good AND bad thing, you WILL see a ton of drunken revelers funneling in and out of the hotel leaving the nightclub and bars.. Food options are in abundance but pricey as well.. (I suggest Comme Ca, or STK for dinner) If you're looking for a little nightlife action, you can't really lose with Marquee day and nightclub,, The place is HUGE, has several different rooms to choose from music wise, BUT, be prepared to spend $$$$ to get a table and the \"vip\" treatment, if not, you can still gain FREE entrance before 10 or 11pm if you're staying at the hotel (or a light cover charge on busier evenings) just show them your room key and give your name and you in!! If you do not shell out money for bottle/table service you WILL BE STANDING all night and man does it get CROWDED!! If you're a gambler there are PLENTY of tables throughout the casino, tables get crowded on the weekends and during big conventions, but this is the norm for any decent hotel in the city.. When checking in, ALWAYS ask for a FOUNTAIN VIEW ROOM, this is the best view from the hotel right over Bellagio's famous lake and the strip.. The views are some of the best I've seen in this city, hands down... Service at the hotel is good, but used to be GREAT, I think now that since they're supposedly the #1 casino in Vegas right now that they aren't trying as hard as when they first opened, that's MY take on it.

Last President\u2019s Day weekend, Friday, March 17-Sunday, March 19, I stayed at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas--undoubtedly the worst hotel experience I have ever had. The ineptitude and disregard for customer service I was shown would be inexcusable at a Motel 6, let alone a luxury property. I would like to mention as well that in addition to Marriot status, I am a Priority Club Platinum member, a Hilton Honors Gold member, and a Club Carlson Gold member. I stay at a lot of hotels. This is my first trip advisor review. The problems at the Cosmopolitan began the moment I checked in and was not welcomed as a Marriott Platinum member. In fact, the clerk had no record at all of my Platinum status. Oddly enough, she handed me a Platinum member welcome letter and then attempted to give me a different, lower category room than the one I initially booked, explaining that it was an \u201cupgrade.\u201d When I asked to speak to a manager, she would not retrieve one, instead shuttling back and forth to the office. I pulled up the hotel confirmation on my cell phone, at which point the clerk took my cell phone to show the manager, still in the back office. I was not at all comfortable handing over my cell phone, but there was nothing else I could do to prove I had actually booked the room. After 45 minutes, the manager emerged and told me the room I had booked, a wraparound terrace suite, was not yet available. I requested a temporary room, as my suite was supposed to be ready within the hour. It took around three hours for the room to be ready. When we arrived at the room, I noticed the lingering smell of vomit. There were cigarette butts on the terrace, missing items in the mini-bar, and, strangest of all, a missing couch cushion. There were also stains on the remaining cushions consistent with the vomit smell. When I attempted to call the front desk to complain, I discovered that both of the room phones were broken. Other issues included several burnt-out light bulbs, a missing hotel guide, and no toilet paper in the second bathroom. The front doorbell--necessary because this was a multi-room suite--was also inoperable. We were later told that the doorbells had been as issue since the hotel\u2019s opening, over a year ago! I have included photographs of the room as I found it. After a night in this environment, I went again to the front desk. After (again!) much waiting and discussion, I was moved to another room, though the thoughtless service continued through the very final hours of my stay. For example, I requested a late check-out, via telephone from my room. I went to lunch in the hotel, and when I attempted to return to the room I discovered my key was no longer valid for the elevator. This necessitated YET ANOTHER trip to the front desk. It turned out that when granting me a late check-out; the front desk had failed to tell me that my key would stop working at 2pm. If I wanted to use it until my checkout at 4pm, I would need a new key. I spent 20 minutes dealing with this issue, which could have been avoided entirely had the clerk simply uttered a single sentence. All told, I spend about six hours (out of my two-night stay) dealing with the various issues described above. Needless to say, the experience at the Cosmopolitan did not live up to the high standards I have come to expect from Marriot.

The best time of day for me was the morning after the post clubbing come down which most people aren't around for. The hotel boasts 3 swimming pools, but be warned they are only open in April which was disappointing. The spa and gym are suitable for a luxury hotel such as this. There is a club within the hotel called marquee which has 3 floors and opens out onto the poole for day time. It seems to be the most popular club on a Monday with long cues so get there for 10.

We were booked into have 2 City view rooms with 2 queen beds in each and we took up the offer to have them as adjoining rooms.

The room was clean and the beds were extremely comfy and the bathroom was a good size. Certainly all in keeping with a 5* hotel. However, as the week went on we started to notice little things that although did not have a major affect on our stay certainly made you wonder if the hotel warrants its 5* billing. The first thing that came to notice was that the in-room safe was already locked which I have to say was rectified very quickly after I raised the issue. Then we noticed that one of the bathroom lights wasnt working. The next day we noticed that both the plugs in the 2 bathroom sinks did not work via the \"plunge\" mechanism on the sink and to get the plug down we had to fiddle with the mechanism under the sink. An empty beer bottle that I had left on the side wasnt removed for 2 days during housekeeping. I also noticed that my friends in the adjoining room had both hotel robes and slippers in the closet whereas our room only had robes and this did not change for the 5 days that we were there. Again in our friends room there was a fire escape plan on the rear of the room door but not in ours. One day the housekeeping failed to put the new toilet roll on the roll holder and just left it sat on top of it. All in all we had a very enjoyable stay and these things did not cause us too much inconvenience but by the same token we did not expect to encounter such things in a 5* hotel.

My favorite public area is the third floor with the pool table and lots of seating to hang out, enjoy a cocktail and decide which restaurant you'll go to.

One caveat-if you stay through a Monday night, beware that, according to a local source, the most popular nightclubs on the strip open on a \"rotating\" basis on the off seasons (not summer) and the Cosmo nightclub is the only club on the strip that's open on Monday nights, so it is jam PACKED with young kids waiting to get into the club.

Scarpetta was very good. Holstein's was OK. The bad: housekeeping was terrible for us. We put the placard on the bed for \"fresh linens\" (as they instructed!) and each day they ignored that and just made our bed as-is. The kicker is that they put that placard back on the bed each day as if they were going to listen to us next time. They didn't empty our garbage. They didn't replenish our toiletries (which were nice, btw). It didn't feel very clean - just passable really. Maybe it was just one bad housekeeper. I don't know. Although there was a kitchenette, complete with a dishwasher, there were no dishes. We called to have some brought to us and were informed that we could have 4 items for free, and then be charged for each item after that. We went with three plates and a knife and managed somehow.

The hotel itself is nice looking, but has a very young crowd (think very tight, very short dresses on everyone - even people who shouldn't wear very tight, very short dresses). I don't mind a young crowd, but I think based on the fact that most people checking in had their own 12packs of beer means the hotel has adjusted its service for the young and not-so affluent crowd. I get the impression they all squeeze into rooms to save money (I sure did at their age). Our friends in the room next door waited over 2 hours for their safe to be fixed or replaced on the first morning. After several follow-up calls, they never did get it fixed. They just ended up using ours. One of our other friends was sick and needed to go to urgent care during the first day there. The concierge not only didn't know where urgent care was, he didn't bother looking it up for them. (Vegas, of all places, would seem like a reasonable place to know where urgent care is). And finally, we had booked with a group of friends thru their group bookings. There is absolutely no advantage to this except to be placed near each other and to have them make reservations for you. Some of our friends were near us, but not all of them had rooms \"ready\" near us so were placed on different floors. Moreover, we had asked for the group coordinator to make our reservation at a restaurant one night, and we were basically told to make it ourselves. They should really re-think their group booking feature and make it a little more alluring since it seems like a great deal for the hotel to have 6+ rooms book up all at once.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBest in Vegas\u201d", "Author": "hooky79", "ReviewID": "UR125665459", "Content": "Well what can you say about this place other than, it's amazing!

It was our 44th anniversary and we chose the Cosmopolitan to begin and end a Great Circle Trip from Nevada into Arizona to see sites in Las Vegas, the Hoover Dam, the Grand Canyon, and the Red Rocks near Sedona, Lake Powell & Glen Canyon Dam, Brice Canyon and Zion National Park. We picked the Cosmo because of its central location on the strip, the fact that it\u2019s new and has a Hertz rental agency in the hotel. Thus, we could rent and return our car there after completing our Great Circle Trip. We booked a great room at a great rate over the hotel web site. It was a TERRACE 1BR with Japanese Soaking Tub with balcony. Prior to the trip concierge was very helpful over the phone & by email assisting us with planning what to do and see while in Las Vegas. When we arrived the in process was quick and efficient in spite of a lot of people checking in. We were pleasantly surprised that they gave us a free upgrade to a room directly overlooking the Bellagio fountains and provided us with a free bottle of Champaign. We enjoyed sitting on the balcony, sipping our Champaign, and watching the night show of the fountain. Overall, despite the lack of attention to detail and the issues below, we found the hotel quite beautiful and enjoyed our stay there. However, the issues we encountered would prevent us from staying there again. After the light show, we went to Holsteins, a restaurant in the lower part of the hotel. We were seated promptly but had to relocate in a futile attempt to find a table that we could hear each other talk. This music throughout the hotel and in particular at Holsteins was so loud as to make it a completely an unenjoyably dining experience. This was true in general throughout the hotel that music was much too loud. All the other restaurants in the hotel were quite loud. Additionally, the only place to get a sit down breakfast in the hotel was the Wicked Spoon which is much like a cafeteria. The only option for breakfast was a fixed price per person for the buffet at $25 per person. $50 for breakfast seemed unrealistic for our budget. The only other place in the hotel open for breakfast was the Va Bene Caff\u00e8 located a good 15 minute one-way through an underground long hall. Here prices were somewhat less (say $18 to $23 for continental pastries & coffee for 2), but there were few or no open seats. We would take our bag of food usually to the nice seating across the hall at a bar closed that early. Here there were tables with nice chairs where we could sit and eat our breakfast. This allowed us to also hear each other talk and enjoy the fabulous views in the hotel. Twice we were asked to leave this area by a rude person appearing to be hotel management as the bar was closed and thus we could not sit there. This didn\u2019t make sense to us as we are staying in the hotel and should be able to use any open seat. Consequently, we choose to go to other dining locations on the strip which were still quite nice, but not loud, and at which we could find seats. As we stayed there longer, we noticed other things that indicated a lack of attention to detail. While our suite room large and was very beautiful, there were annoying issues. First, it was impossible to figure out how to turn on certain lights. For example, the switch for the light in the ceiling between the bathroom and closet was on the back side of the wall near the front door some 15 feet away. The lights for inside the bathroom were outside the bathroom. There was one floor lamp we never did figure out how to turn on. The door to the toilet room would not stay open, when it closed it was completely dark, and the light switch was outside on the wall. Another annoyance was the direction of on/off for the hot and cold water. Normally the handle for a water faucet turns on in a counterclockwise direction and off in a clockwise direction. These were reversed. Also, the pull to release the drain did not function (this was promptly fixed after we complained.) But, they were clueless regarding the water faucet problem. The final annoying issue was when I checked my bill on the television account function. I found I owed $1800 having only been there 1 night of the 3. Our rate was $161 per night. Upon further inspection, having double checked that the room number was correct, I discovered this was the bill for someone else who stayed in the room previously to us. I notified the front desk and after arguing with me for 5 minutes as they didn\u2019t show me checked into the room, they realized their error and corrected it several hours later. Finally, when we went to rent our Hertz car we looked all over the floor where it was supposed to be, but could not find it. Fortunately, one of the senior hotel managers then off duty saw that we looked lost and personally walked us to the Hertz counter. He said that often guests cannot find the counter as hotel management doesn\u2019t want to disrupt the ambiance of the hotel by putting up location markers or signs for the Hertz counter. How annoying is that! We signed up for our car. We took the elevators to the garage 5 floors down to find our car. We found that the location to pick up/drop off the Hertz cars similarly not marked. It was so bad we got into the wrong car at first and almost took off with it, but realized at the last minute it was not the brand we had rented. There were no attendants in the garage. Same problem returning drove around for 15 minutes trying to find where to return to park the car. These annoyances and lack of attention to detail make a potentially top rated hotel into a mediocre on at best.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cExtremely poor customer service\u201d", "Author": "Dr_Aaltonen", "ReviewID": "UR125582628", "Content": "This could be a five star hotel, it should be. It's really a nice one with good location. Rooms are beautiful, spacious, and utilize new technology (all lights remote controlled, big flat screens with advanced features, etc.). But they do not seem to care about their clients. It's unacceptable. When checkin it took ages. Clerk did start the process properly, but then he went to the back-office for at least 20 minutes. On coming back he apologized the delay to be sure room is ready. It's pretty obvious it took so long because they did not have any room in the category I have reserved ready, and he had discussed if he should give me the room I got. This was about 8:00 pm. I had a terrace suite (#5633), which was really nice. When I came into it both balcony doors were open. I looked briefly the view, close them, put my stuff into closet and went into the shower. When I came back I smelt it immediately \u2013 vomit. Clearly someone has puked on the carpet, somewhere around sleeping room and living room doorway, and the balcony doors were open to get some fresh air into the suite. Safe was not working either, it was closed, and couldn't be opened. I had 20 hours flight, and was quite exhausted. I called the front desk and complained about the odor. They said that refreshing has been ordered already earlier. This, in addition of balcony doors being open and taking so long to get a room clearly points out that the problem has been well known before my arrival. I told that I want to go asleep now and do not want any action that time, but expect problem to be taken care or new room arranged day after, and safe to be opened. In the morning when I woke up the smell was as bad as earlier. On the way to the breakfast I visited front desk and reminded them to take care of the issues saying that I'll be away all day. When I got back to my suite it smelt as awful as earlier, and the safe was still closed. I had a voice message saying that safe cannot be opened without me. I had clearly pointed out that the safe was closed when I arrived, what do they need me for! But much worse problem was the smell, it was unbearable. I called front desk again. They promised to call back soon. I waited for 45 minutes and called again, requiring someone from management come and check the room. They said also that no (similar) room was available. I told that they have to figure out something to solve this out, room was not livable. I had a room for 5 nights, so it was a big deal. During a phone call a maintenance guy knocked on the door. When I told my diagnosis, he immediately agreed. Someone has puked on the carpet and the room was not livable. He called front desk saying what I had told them three times earlier. I got a new room (5933) right away. Bell boy transferred my stuff. All this took less than 15 minutes, after 3 phone calls and waiting all day (or actually, at that point, nearly 24 hours). In new room there were dozens of cut nails on bedroom carpet (who does such...?) and some garbage on the bathroom floor. Corkscrew was missing, bedroom closet light was not working, the were no robes (as in earlier room there were), and some other small things. It appeared that someone had a late check-out and the room was not properly cleaned. Or it might be that cleaning in Cosmopolitan is like this - one room having a terrible smell and the other cut nails with some other garbage here and there. But there was no smell, and I could well live there! Obviously it's not hotels fault, if someone pukes on the floor. But no proper hotel should give that kind of a room to any customer. If they truly don't have any other similar or better room (which was actually not true), they should get downgraded room and compensate it somehow, and upgrade again whenever possible. If hotel is totally full, they should suggest a room from another hotel. In Las Vegas there are some. Also, front desk telling me that there are no other rooms available when such can be arranged in 15 minutes after a maintenance called them is inexcusable. And if that new room was not cleaned fully, they should have proposed me going to a dinner (it was 6.30 pm) on their expense and then take care of the problem. Obviously the front desk lied to me when saying there was no room, I regard it close to criminal behavior. I strongly believe there were some bigger suites free too, they just did not want to give me one, while I had a pretty good reason, something due to them (or their earlier customers). Due to the inconvenience the front desk promised me 50 dollars to be spent on room service. I used room service, but never saw any indemnity in my account. So that too was only talk. Considering the rate I paid for my suite, $50 was pretty ridiculous, but even that was not taken care as promised. You do whatever you want, but my recommendation is: don't go there.

Lets start at the beginning then. The reception area is gorgeous with various plasma effects on the pillars and glass panels giving a wonderful feeling of tranquility. There were ample amount on reception desk and even although we were about 4th in line in one of around 10 queues, we waited no more than 5/10 minutes. The guy behind desk, came over and greeted us and asked us to follow him to his desk whilst apologising for our wait. I cheekily said it would be fine as long as he made up for it by getting us a nice Bellagio fountain view room to which a nod and a wink confirmed he would do his best for us. 5 minutes later and we were making our way up to our Fountain View Suite which was absolutely stunning. Huge bathroom and walk in shower. Huge living space with corner suite and LCD television. Amazing Superking bed with the most comfortable pillows and sheets I have experienced. And to cap it all, a full outside balcony with view of the gorgeous Fountains and Eiffel Tower. Stunning doesn't describe it. So the room gets 12 out of 10, but what about the rest ? The casino floor didnt impress me at first but it grew on me by the end of the trip to be honest. Although a new 5 star hotel, the machines and tables are fairly priced for all budgets so dont be put off by thinking this is a $25 minimum bet hotel. We started off with 2 Cosmopolitan cocktails in the very lovely Chandelier bar and they didnt disappoint. The best i have tasted across various cocktail bars all around the world. Other bars included the Sports bar on the ground floor which had plenty of action on all the televisions and live bands every now and again and Bond bar which had some rather attractive girls dancing in Window boxes which was strange, but nice. Bars 10 out of 10. Food wise, we had breakfast on the room and this is only obtainable at The Wicked Spoon. The queues were terrible it has to be said and getting to your seat is a bit of a challenge. Once thats out of the way though, the selection on offer is vast and will suit everyones taste. So many different cooking stations for all tastes and you wont leave on an empty stomach. We also had a great lunch in Holsteins on the 2nd floor as well and the room service Burger was top notch.

I feel like I've stayed EVERYWHERE in Vegas and this is a place I'd definitely come back to because it doesn't suffer from the typical Vegas property problems. First, the long hallway problem. Too many places in Vegas, even spots like the Four Seasons, have these insanely long hallways once you get off the lift. I know, seems petty, but its gotten out of hand. This hotel is one of the tallest in Vegas but also has about the smaller per-floor layout I've seen, so no hike from the my room to the elevator. The views are great. Partly because its taller (ask for a high floor) but also because of how its laid out, you don't get the all-too-typical Las Vegas \"view over a large flat roof with the occasional vent\". Instead, the room I was given (mid-range) overlooked the Bellagio Fountains and had a great view of the strip in the northern direction, with nothing blocking my 180 degree vista. It felt SO much less claustrophobic than I'm used to. And best of all, most rooms have a small outdoor balcony to enjoy the view from! I don't think I've ever got that in Vegas. In a lot of ways, the physical layout & balcony reminds me of the Elysium in Chicago. The room itself was very high-tech with great TV/room integration that was fun to play with. Decent mini-bar (not the best). Nice desk work area, comfy bed, nice bathroom. All the usual stuff. Another nice bonus is that its owned by Marriott so if you have status there, you get some bonuses and points. Not many Vegas strip hotels are part of national chains, so that's cool. I also like that the Casino floor is a lot more compact than most, which means less wandering around between the door/valet and elevators. Not quite as nice as, say, the Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental in terms of avoiding the Casino-floor-commute, but better and a step in that direction. Unless you're going to ultra luxury on your trip, I think this is a great chance of pace and much better than nearly all of the big stirp hotels.

There is a room safe in the wardrobe and whenever we left we put all our valuables in this.

Was there just 2 days ago for my big bday bash. Upon our arrival, I was impressed with the layout of the check in/out area and the service. There were areas to lounge, nice screens w/images to gaze at and the guy that handled our check in was friendly and detailed about the hotel's layout & gave us a map. The elevators are a bit strange though but easy to find (be sure to read the floor #'s above the entrances before boarding). I say strange because you need to insert your room key and press the floor # in order for it to take you to your floor. Sometimes it doesn't work & you may have to try a few times. Once into our room, we checked into the most basic room but were still impressed. We had a fabulous view overlooking Bellagio and the strip. We were on the 58th floor. The room had very comfortable beds that you could just sink into easily & sleep. I liked that the bathroom had 2 sinks so you don't have to share one. The shower is a bit funny with a full viewable window but there's a blind you can draw :) The light switches were convenient in that you had the option to dim or increase the level of lighting. They had the usual drinks/snacks that you have to pay for, downside is no extra room in the fridge so we had to stack perishable items we bought on top of the cans. I liked that they had complimentary slippers stored under the safe in the closet area. I also found the clock/phone was handy. It always displays the time clearly in case your radio isn't plugged in like ours was. Now onto the rest of the hotel. My group didn't gamble but the casino decor was fabulous especially when you get to the bar area. Giant chandelier w/crystals dangling and adorning a stair case which leads upstairs to a lounge, shops and the hotel's club Marquee which you must visit! Its totally one of a kind w/its multiple areas w/diff. music playing. I didn't get to check out any stores but they seem on the pricier side. One great thing I have to say about this hotel is how easy it is to get from one end to the next. As soon as you exit the elevators & follow the glittery marbled floor, it leads you through the casino and out to the strip. The upper floor leads you straight out to the overpass which takes you across the street. Unlike other hotels which are like a maze w/signs pointing to endless exits & services. We really wanted to hit the pool (they have 3) but the 2 main ones were closed. According to the staff, pools are open by early March. The only pool open was the one at Marquee (day club hours). Another great thing is the front entrance is on the strip, unlike my last experience at a Citycenter hotel which required endless walking on paths/stairs before finally getting onto the strip. On our last day, service was good once again at check out, there is no resort fee by the way :) Our server let us keep our room keys & the funny thing is the sensors on the snack items showed they were moved. We didn't eat any but our server was cool about it. She laughed it off & didn't make a fuss.

I usually hit Vegas 4 times a year and have stayed at quite a few of the nicer properties. My go to is the Palazzo which I have never had a bad experience with, however in order to branch out and see what the hype was all about this time it was the Cosmo. Now, prior to this trip I'd read my share of reviews here on the Cosmo and notices that about 80% of the reviews were pretty positive with 20% being somewhat negative with the same problems and issues being brought up over and over which were mainly poor check in experience, inadequate or lack of cleaning of the rooms and very slow room service. There are also quite a few negative comments about the buffet etc and the casino but those are not as major. I checked in on a Wednesday early afternoon, there was hardly anybody in line at check-in, with less than a 5 minute wait I was up at one of the desks checking in. It went smoothly took probably less than 5 minutes and I was heading up to my Wraparound Terrace Suite with excitement. The rooms was pretty fantastic, the double sided terrance with a full view of the strip and Bellagio fountains was incredible. The modern furnishings in the room were a nice touch, and after a pretty thorough review, other than a few smudges here and there, I found the room to be very well cleaned. I did find that one of the Televisions was not working very well and one of the phones did not work either. Luckily we weren't planning on watching too much TV and the other phone was fine. They tried to go so high tech that it is not coming back to haunt them, however I will say that in general these issues did not damper our stay. From a sleep experience, I found the beds to very comfortable however the pillows were a bit soft but that is more of a personal issue. I was up on the 58th floor and had no issues with noise at any time of the night. Yes the Casino is small and on the weekend all the minimums are high during the weekend evenings but what do you expect, I actually enjoyed playing at the Cosmo casino and overall had great service from the cocktail waitresses as well. I did hit the Wicked Spoon buffet, I don't know if it is better than the Bellagio which has been my standard, but it was definitely good, and a bit different since for a lot of the items they have individual portions already served ready to go. Overall experience as excellent, however keep in mind the parameters of my stay which may have helped me avoid some of the negative issues others have been reporting. I checked in mid week early afternoon, and I was booked in one of their nicer suites. Regardless, after this experience, I would definitely go back again.

For some reason I didn't understand they had see my U.S. drivers license, passport and that of my wife also (one form of ID wasn't sufficient). She then couldn't find my reservation and took 20 minutes before mysteriously finding the reservation and refusing to explain why it didn't appear earlier. I asked for a room towards the fountains to be told that none were available...instead we received a room facing the Aria where we heard about half a dozen fire engines during the evening (to the credit of the manager, he moved us to a room facing the opposite direction the next day when I commented on the noise). The room is decorated with a 70's flair which isn't really my style. The room was large and comfortable with a bedroom and living areas but a well adorned bathroom.

I was told housekeeping would be up to clean the carpet stain...the stain was never cleaned during my three night stay. I actual put the ironing board over the large spot so I wouldnt have to look at it as I entered or exited the room. My only room service order was incorrect ...then corrected. I was also issued a &70.00 food credit for the errors.. I bagged my breakfast in the room idea and went to the conference for coffee. The conference amenenties were above average and the service was great..I was obviously in the wrong part of the Tower (46 floor). Another note...when you make your reservation your told the rooms are large with kitchenetts. Well the rooms are void of coffee makers and if you put anything in the refer you'll trip ALL the mini bar sensors..The sad part about our stay is we choose not to play or eat on the property due to the above listed issues. I feel the propertys Reservations, Front Desk and housekeeping/roomservice have a disconnect....I live in NV. This is the first time I have ever complained regarding the overall service. I would not recommend or stay at the Cosmo again.

I arrived via taxi and entered the lobby that immediately reeked of smoke. Yup, I was in Vegas. I have an allergy to several chemicals found in cigarettes, so it bothers me a lot when I'm in Vegas and have to walk through smoke filled casino's just to get to my room. I understand that's Vegas, but I wish there were ways to avoid the smoke. Check in was easy. I arrived at about 1pm and waited in line for about 10 minutes. They had a staff member guiding people to the shortest check in line. I was offered an upgrade for a fee but declined because work wouldn't pay for it and I didn't want to pay for it myself. I also believe in the idea that you should book the room that you want and should not expect an upgrade. I was given a room on the 52nd floor and given my keys to the room and able to go up and freshen up immediately even though it was before the stated check in time. The Room I booked a standard room, which did not have a balcony but did have a nice view of the fountains of The Bellagio. I want to point out specifically that you do not need to book a balcony room or more to have the great view. I doubt that the hotel could guarantee this view, but it is possible. The room itself is very nice and modern, just my style. In the room were two double beds, two small chairs and a small table next to the window overlooking the view, a desk, a large flat screen TV, and a closet. The beds were comfortable and had four pillows on each of them. My biggest complaint was the fact that it became extremely hot at night in the room. Twice the AC turned itself off at night and I woke up sweating. I came to the conclusion that the unit must be motion controlled and only comes on when you're moving around in the room because it was always a bit warmer when I entered the room but it cooled down as I was in it for a bit. I did have trouble with the TV not working. I called the \"beck and call\" line to see if I was doing something wrong and just couldn't work the remote or if there was something wrong with the TV. They sent someone up, who arrived about 15 minutes after my call, and he fixed the TV in 15 minutes after playing with the back of the TV and resetting a few things. I would also note that housekeeping was always good. I had no complaints and my room was in good shape. As for noise in the room, I barely heard much of anything up on the 52nd floor. I could hear the occasional siren on the streets, but it wasn't very loud. The only other noise I could hear was the thunderous sound of the fountains every 30-15 minutes depending on the time of day. This noise was from the vast volume of water being sprayed into the air and crashing down onto the water below. It literally sounded like a far off thunder boom. It wasn't bothersome and never woke me up. The fountains go on until midnight, but even going to bed before then, I never really noticed it unless I was listening for it. The bathroom had plenty of counter space and a semi-seperate toilet section. I say this because it's like a bathroom stall where the door doesn't go from ceiling to floor. I would have preferred it if the door went from floor to ceiling. In addition, there's a separate shower stall that's pretty large with a glass panel to the bedroom that lets in more light. There is a blind that you can close, but when closed, the shower is very dark. The shower must have been designed by a man because it is not the most female-friendly with nothing to hold onto or prop a leg up on to shave ones legs. The shower head was also not designed for someone under 5'5\". At 5'1\", I had a hard time washing my hair because the shower spray spread out so much that I could fit my entire head inside the inner hole created by the outward spray of the shower head, so I had to wash my hair in sections. The toiletries are pretty good. I always bring my own because I'm usually not very impressed with the provided toiletries, but the ones provided are good. I only used the lotion I brought and used the rest of the toiletries provided. For reference, they provide mouthwash, soap, body wash, shampoo, conditioner, q-tips, cotton balls, and a shower cap. I found that the staff at The Cosmo was very friendly. When I visited the hotel last year when I was also here for business, I found the staff was much more friendly than The Palazzo, where I stayed last time. If I passed a staff member in the hall, they would always say hello and wish me a good day. I felt like they valued me as a customer much more so than The Pallazzo where I felt more like a number. In general, I felt the staff gave off a nice vibe and created a pleasant atmosphere. The overall atmosphere and vibe of the hotel is that of a very modern, hip vibe, which I enjoyed. I pictured the Cosmo, with its chandelier bar and crystals all over the place as how some of the older hotels must have looked in their heyday. I do think that the hotel will need to take notes from The Contemporary in Disney, which also boasts itself for being a modern hotel, and perform updates on a regular basis to continue to be considered a hip, modern hotel. Would I stay here again? Absolutely. The location is excellent. You're close to many other hotels and activities. I do wish the hotel had at few more quick service restaurants to grab a quick breakfast or lunch while on the go.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Little Rock, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cGreat modern hotel in the middle of the Vegas strip...\u201d", "Author": "Bryan R", "ReviewID": "UR125112609", "Content": "I attended a work conference with my wife at the Cosmo last Fall.

Perhaps I'm wrong, but I LOVED this place! The lobby is, in a word, beautiful. Video screens make up the large columns and these change based on the time of day it is. Lovely! Check in was very quick, despite our large group checking in. We had a small snafu in that I had reserved a king room with a balcony, but when we got to the room is was a double queen city room. We went back down to the lobby and had to upgrade the price per night to get a room with the amentities we wanted, which ended up being a suite. (No comp here, maybe because of the locked in rates?) LOVE! LOVE! LOVE this place! The bathroom was very large, with a jetted tub, a huge shower and separate water closet, double sinks and a makeup mirror, plus a hair dryer in the drawer. There was a window from the bath to the living room, but blinds were on there for privacy. The living room area was awesome with an L shaped sofa, work area, and large flat screen tv. The kitchenette was tiny, and unfortunately you could not use the minifridge because it was already stocked. WARNING - Unless you want to pay for it, don't pick up the snacks or touch the drinks in the fridge. Every item is weighted and you will automatically be charged for them. Eek! But our king size bed was heavenly! It faced another large flat screen tv and 3 door closet with automatic lights. It was also next to the wonderfully spacious balcony that overlooked the Bellagio fountain and the strip. You could hear the music during the fountain show, but no noise at all from the strip. This is a \"smart room,\" in that you can control the lights, order room service, make spa appts, all from either the phone by the bed or the television. Awesome! No more having to get up to turn off the lights someone left on in the bathroom. There is an entire city in your hotel! Restaurants, bars, night clubs, shopping, casino. One note though, there are no vending machines at all in this hotel. Luckily, there is a pedestrian walk that crosses the street from level 2, which takes you directly to a Walgreens and the other-worldly LV Strip. Because this is such a new and \"hip\" hotel, there are a lot of beautiful people who stay here. The lobby, restaurants, and shopping areas get very busy at night.

There's simply nothing else like it, even compared to the other new resorts on the Strip. However, the service just doesn't measure up. From the long (and seemingly unmoving) lines at check in to the very uneven housekeeping to the requests that have to be made multiple times before anything happens, to the lines for the club that congest nearly all of the public space at night, it is clear that the service is not up to par with the other 4+/5-star properties in town. Additionally, you have to consider the other guests, who especially on long weekends are anything but the classiest. My advice is to stay at another place and enjoy The Cosmopolitan just for its restaurants and shops.

I'm glad I did. Our check-in experience was not the nightmare that others have shared. The red check-in desks provide a really unique and personal touch but could be the reason why check-in gets so backed up. It's strange that staff do not wear any name badges. Debbie, (I asked her for her name) our check-in manager could not have been more welcoming and inviting. I really wanted to love this hotel but as many others have already stated, the housekeeping here is just lousy. I cannot understand how this is possible since the place is so new - I mean how hard is it to keep clean? The minute we walked in the door, there were visible crumbs on the floor. The kitchenette floor was sticky and you could see that something had spilled out from the mini fridge. Opened the mini fridge and sure enough something was spilled inside and dripped on the floor. Some kind of red sauce was splattered across the backsplash behind the sink. The \"snack tray\" which sits dead smack in the middle of the counter also had something spilled all over the bottom. This snack tray, btw, is triggered to hit your room account, so be careful not to knock over something unless you intentionally want to eat the obviously stale popcorn or use the condoms that are displayed there. The lamp was broken and hanging by the cord, and the handle to the blinds was laying broken on the floor. Long strands of black hair were on the floor of the bathroom and in the drawer between the sinks. The glass shower stall door had definitely not been cleaned. Splatters of some beverage dotted the top of the desk. On the coffee table, there is a ceramic covered dish which had appeared to have been used as a cup - the inside was coated with a pink film. Of course we called housekeeping who arrived fairly quickly and Marion set about on a mission to clean this room. She was very sweet and contacted maintenance who also came right away and fixed the lamp and blinds. We went off to get something to eat and returned to our room which was definitely cleaner, but the black hair remained in the bathroom for our entire visit (3 days). Also, there was a penny on the bedroom floor that also remained there for our entire visit. Yes, the views of the Bellagio fountains are amazing. It's a trade off - if you know going in that your room is going to be dirty, but you will deal with it for the experience and the view, then do it. We also brought paper cups, coffee, plastic ware, napkins, etc after reading that there was no coffee pot or utensils in the room. What a saving grace if you need a cup of joe in the a.m. and do not feel like getting dressed and going downstairs. If you do go down for coffee - it's not cheap - but no one tells you that refills are free so take note. The hotel itself is really modern and sparkly; restaurants are excellent but expect to pay; atmosphere is young and stylish. I enjoyed the vibe of this hotel and the location was perfect. Overall, I would say that in the short time its been open, the Cosmo caters to the young, jet-setting party crowd who are giving it the beatdown. I would stay here again for the novelty of it but if they continue this level of housekeeping, then the hotel will not only be dirty but will also be a germ festival.

The location of the hotel is great it is in the middle of the strip we didn't have to walk far to get anywhere everything is close by shops, clubs, restaurants are all within 5 minutes or less walking distance from the hotel.

The Cosmopolitan also is different as it does not have the HUGE malls, but maintain a very unique shopping and eating experience. Every store and restaurant in The Cosmopolitan is unique to Vegas, so you won't find it anywhere else!! STK is a very nice high energy dinner spot that I suggest. For the more casual meal is Holsteins, which mainly serves specialty burgers and shakes, yet also includes about 40 beers on tap. Our room was also excellent.

When we walked in there was a guy bent over and all of a sudden he threw up right at our feet. Yuck! It was packed in there. Not enjoyable for us. More for 21 year olds who like techno. We went to a Kid Rock concert at the House of Blues. It was awesome. All the hotel lobbies/casinos were smokey. Did not win a dime at the casino's around our hotel. Also, minimum bets were higher. We had better luck over in the older part of town.(by the Fitz/Binions/Golden Nugget. Light show down there was pretty cool. More layer back over there. People dressed more casual. We enjoyed walking through all the casino lobbies. They are beautiful. Especially the Bellagio. Not enough time to see any shows other than the Kid Rock concert.

Beautiful marble floors, ceiling high columns that contain the most impressive moving art,(think of the coolest lava lamp you ever saw), with patterns that change daily. Continue walking towards the casino and you pass a sleek metallic looking bar and sitting area on your left. As you enter the \"Pit\", you'll be impressed by the variety of games and dealers with genuine smiles working the tables. Note: I found out that the Cosmo makes all employees take a personality test as part of the hiring process. For the most part, the employees are energetic, sincere, helpful and appreciative to be able to serve you. From dealer to custodians, you can't find a more happy group of employees. I have praised management oft times for the professionalism and courtesy I've received while at their Casino. Their restaurants are good but pricey. My only request would be a cafe or food court that allowed a modestly priced light faire menu as we are locals. It would be nice to get a sandwich or burger for less than $16-18 for as often as we frequent the establishment. Still, they are not pricier than any of the other top rated casino's on the strip. They do have decent promo's for locals...but could improve there as well. But, aside from a few personal requests on my part, the Cosmopolitan hands down blows away the other high end strip casino. I've tried every major and local casino in the 3 years we've lived here, and the Cosmo is the only casino that has me constantly leaving with a smile on my face. Oh, the rooms are gorgeous as well.

Upon check-in we were offered an \"upgrade\"; for $25 more per night we were offered a one bedroom suite with 2 bathrooms. Since we were told it was the only room ready, we agreed and were quite happy with the room. Note that if you stay in the West Tower you will be above the Lobby, well away from the Strip. East Tower rooms are closer to Las Vegas Blvd. above the restaurants and casino. Both have nice views facing north over the Bellagio fountain show. South-facing rooms would have a view of the modern architecture of City Center. Our room was very spacious, however the furniture is already looking a bit worn as are the carpets, surprising for a new -ish hotel. It was nice to have a kitchenette but note the small fridge is full of minibar items. There was a small dishwasher, but no dishes or cutlery. I would recommend ordering room service (not cheap!) upon arrival and then keeping the dishes for the remainder of your stay if you plan on eating in the room...don't forget a bit of dishwasher soap from home. The real highlight of the room was the gorgeous main bathroom. The square soaking tub was much smaller than I had hoped, but I still managed a decent soak. You can perch on a step in the tub and soak in the marvelous view, even lovelier at night. Beside that is a large shower, and two vanities along the back wall. The toilet is tucked away in its own cubicle with nausea-inducing graphic wallpaper on the walls. The room was comfortable and relatively quiet, except for one morning when our neighbor decided that 5 a.m. was a great time to blast house music. This is Vegas, after all. We did not think the bed was comfortable but we enjoyed the bathroom and the huge balcony. The Spa is not huge, but fairly nice. Massage therapists are amazing, so it's definitely worth it to indulge. While the lobby is ultra-cool with its pillars of incredible moving art, the rest of the hotel is a bit bland. Ceilings in the Casino are low, and ventilation is very poor, and the decor in the public areas is really a hodge-podge of differing styles, just doesn't work in the end. We had bad luck with the food. The raves for the Wicked Spoon Buffet are undeserved, much of the food on the Brunch spread was less-than-fresh. The expensive French restaurant Comme ca was a huge disappointment, Scott Conant's wine bar D.O.C.G also disappointed, as did the odd but charming China Poblano. Jaleo was the best restaurant we tried in the hotel, great tapas! The Henry adjacent to the Casino serves up a decent breakfast and some good burgers and sandwiches. I would recommend this place for a younger traveler. I will probably stay somewhere else next time as I prefer the resorts with plenty of great dining and shopping choices.

From the moment you walk in you're in complete awe... very modern, trendy, elegant, flashy... LOVED the look. The rooms were equally impressive. I had a room with a view of the Bellagio fountains. Very cool when you want to just relax with a glass of champagne on the balcony (which not a lot of hotels have on the strip). The shower, and japanese soaking tub were very nice. The room was trendy, and fun - books, and interesting art all around. The hotel has 3 pools; the Boulevard Pool overlooks the strip, another nice touch. Food was great, restaurants very nice, location is perfect. Price is reasonable. My issues - room service wasn't very good. They did clean the rooms, but it seemed half heartedly and more than once they left dishes from room service behind. The service at the pool was absolutely terrible. I had one experience where I sat for 20 minutes by the pool where no one approached me. I went to the front desk to ask the kid working there if he could send someone over. 40 minutes later no one had arrived. I grabbed another pool attendent as he walked by, and asked that he send someone over. Finally a waitress arrived only to tell me she would be right back... of course she never showed. I mentioned this to the front desk later, at which point they gave me a free sandwich (??). Also, the pool was extremely busy - no lounge chairs were free. You can, however, rent the day beds for an additional $200/day. I wasn't overly impressed with this as most times you're in Vegas you're in the pool for a bit, then down to the strip, then back to the pool. I can't justify spending that if I'm only using it 1/2 the time. Another day we tried to check out the Marquee Dayclub Pool (as the others were full), and they had it closed setting up for the evening's live music. Totally understandable, but a bit irriating when you can't get in any of the other ones. The concierge wasn't helpful either - I asked the woman if she could recommend any good shows, or if they had any deals - most Vegas hotels will offer you discounts to a club or show - no such luck here. No promotions, very little as far as suggestions. They have an \"Identity Membership\" program where you are issued a card, and everywhere you spend $ in the hotel you accumulate points for discounts later. Of course this was mentioned to us the day we checked out... after spending hundreds of dollars at the restaurants and shops. Evidently, no points were earned. All in all I think it's worth checking out as its a very impressive hotel esthetically.

The balcony is huge and we ordered breakfast and sat there with our coffee and orange juice watching the sun rise over the strip, absolutely wonderful. Our room rate included complimentary breakfast in the buffet, and I have to say that - having experienced some below par buffets in Vegas on previous trips - this buffet is something else. I didn't think I would bother with the free breakfast, but having tried it once, we went for it nearly every single day. Only the wonderful Huevos Rancheros at Margeritaville tempted us away a couple of times! The room itself was lush. Beautifully decorated, very edgy and arty, with lots of nice touches. The room controls through the tv took a bit of getting used to, but once we'd figured it out you could do just about anything, finely tune the climate and the lighting, book restaurants and spa services, wake up calls, etc. etc. The staff were very friendly, and the room was immaculate every single day. I've seen people complain about the staff here, but I can honestly say that we found everyone to be very knowledgeable and friendly. The bars all have their own special little quirks, and I know everyone raves about the Chandelier bar, but we had most fun in the Vesper bar, where the people watching is second to none. The Cosmo is a classy hotel, which may not have the opulence of Bellagio or Wynn, but beats them hands-down with it's trendy decor and party feel. We're not kids - both edging on 40 now! - but the Cosmo really does cater for everyone. The casino is great and the restaurants are so good that it's tempting to eat in the hotel every night. If you do nothing else, try the burgers at Holsteins. We went there twice! The hidden pizza place is a great way to end a night out too. My only niggle - that I am still a bit confused about - is that on check-in the receptionist asked for a card that he could take $100 a day room charges up front from. So $700 for our stay, to be given back (minus any charges) on check-out.

From the time you check in to the amazing lobby (amazing in a 'cosmo' sort of way, not a bright, glittering lobby as are the other older properties), you know you're in for a treat. Spend the extra to get the fountain view terrace studio, you won't be disappointed. The rooms are beautifully-appointed with so many great features and extra touches, including the one light switch at the door that turns all the lights on or off. The shower/tub combo area and double-sink were perfect for this couple, the bed was comfortable, the view from the terrace of the Bellagio fountain was incredible, day and night. Service was great from (yes, the bartenders) to front desk, to the doormen. We didn't have much of a chance to explore the restaurants, but did have a quick meal at D.O.C.G. and it was very good. Wish we could have lingered longer there. The casino doesn't seem that busy, but I suspect it takes time to build your client base with that. Also one of the smaller casinos in Vegas, but that wasn't a bad thing for us. At least you don't get lost in it, like the one at Caesar's and some other places. Bond is a very funky bar on the northeast corner of the building, complete with go-go dancers and Book & Stage had a hot-sounding live band playing when we came back to the hotel one night, but unfortunately we were too bagged to enjoy them. And the Chandelier is a beautiful signature bar, two stories high. My wife also raved about the Sahra Spa, said it was the best she's ever experienced (and there's been a few). Hats off as well to the servers at the bar in the Grand Lux at the Venetian (another amazing hotel), made one (okay, two) of the best gin martinis I've ever had and went out of their way to hook us up on the phone with some fellow travelers when my wife realized she'd forgotten her phone.

Great time in Vegas, although I wish the city could do something about those people in the 'sex' t-shirts who click those little girly cards at you and thrust them in your face when you're walking on the sidewalk...with your wife at your side.

On our second night we ordered room service which was bought up to the room so cold it was like it had come from the fridge and not the hot sandwich I had ordered. again money refunded but no apology. Food was inedible. we left early (5.30am) the next day to go to the grand canyon and returned at about 8.00pm. when we came back, the room stank. Neither room service nor housekeeping felt it fit to clear up last nights food. room service hadn't cleaned anything at all except change the sheets to ripped sheets (completely serious, they put ripped bedsheets on the bed), they didn't empty the bins, clean and replace the soap dish, hoover up crumbs, clean the toilet or replace the empty toilet paper roll. obviously I was gutted given it was our honeymoon, another point which they chose to ignore despite being informed in advance of our stay. in fact when we told them at our arrival, they could barely muster a congratulations to us, let alone a complimentary bottle of wine. when I saw the state of the room i complained the housekeeper and bought him up to show him the room expressing my upset at the service and the effect on my honeymoon. (he agreed that the service has been appalling) He got the room cleaned again but this time in front of us. i didn't have the will to complain but even then they did a lackluster job. it took them 15 minutes and they didn't even clean the table of crumbs where the food had been. They obviously have no idea how to clean a room. By way of an apology we were given a bottle of champagne and strawberries. A note attached said - happy anniversary - clearly again we weren't listened to otherwise they would have said congratulations on your wedding/honeymoon. Communication isn't key for the Cosmopolitan. (a small issue but added to the above we were fed up). The next day when we came back after a day out the room had been minimally cleaned but the Champagne and strawberries were still there. Housekeeping is lazy at best but clearly doesn't do its job properly. I really do question their hygiene standards. They have agreed to give us three night stay refund (which we are waiting for) and gave us to complimentary spa treatments. All very nice but a perfect and friendly stay would have been preferable.

As we glanced to the East from the open, airy oversized private terrace, we had a beautiful view of the Eiffel Tower and the Paris. The \"largest chandelier in the world\" is striking and clever, engulfing several stories of bars and restaurants as it does, and the walls covered in flat panel LED displays that change constantly are amazing, if a bit disorienting. Originally, Eichner had an interior that was designed in a \"flashy, glam-rock look, with bold prints and big mirrors\", but since he defaulted and Deutsche Bank foreclosed, the interior and rooms have been redesigned twice, to the tune of over a billion dollars, resulting in what I would call a Neo-modern/post-modern/retro-techno glam eclectic chic (how's that for a mouthful)!

The construction delays, redesigns, and constantly changing ownership created havoc that resulted not only in Robin Leach (Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous) and others filing a class- action law suit to get out of their penthouse condominium contracts, but also in confusion and chaos with labor/housekeeping contracts. In a nutshell, while the decor, views, and facilities are remarkable, if a bit more of an eclectic mash-up than originally intended, the services have suffered noticeably, even under the management of Marriott. Indeed, one wonders what Marriott will do with the place, after acquiring it at a huge discount at what amounts to a high-stakes Las Vegas garage sale. But we had a good time, don't get me wrong. The clubs are always jumpin', the atmosphere is superchill, and the decor attention-grabbing. There are plenty of great restaurants, if a bit overpriced, and lots to gawk at, including some striking \"progressive art,\" blending fantasy, legacy technology and industrial manufacturing themes. We danced, drank, partied, dined, swam, shopped, and - too much to detail here.

The Fridge was also missing a bottle of liquor and the clips that keep the bottles in place were broken off most of the top shelf liquor so when you opened or closed the door the grey goose and white wine would fall out..leading to in-room charges that we had no control over since the clips were broken off. The TV in the Living room did not work. Nor did the climate control options on the tv's and on the phone. The Lights only turned all on from the Hello and Good Bye buttons at the front of the room.

Instead of sending someone to fix things, instead of offering someone to come fix our room... they offered to upgrade our room for $50 per night to a wrap around. We were fine in our room.. so that caught us off guard as we had only asked to have things fixed...but we declined the upgrade feeling that it should have been offered at no cost due to the fact our room was in the state that it was in. They responded condescendingly saying.. Ok thats fine..the room we had picked out for you was fantastic... but we will send someone up right away to fix your problems just for you. Tone was not what we expected. .. We waited for 3 hours and placed several calls to front desk - so we decided to go down and start enjoying our vacation. We stopped at front desk and complained and was told all things would be fixed with in 30 min. we told the gentleman at the front desk that we would be out for a while but to have them go in and fix things while we were away. We came back at 11pm that evening to find nothing fixed. We slept on it and waiting to complain for a 4th time at the front desk in the morning. When we went down sunday morning they told us our new room was ready.... we stared at each other for about 30 seconds with no one talking. I asked Why we had a room ready when all we want is for our room to be fixed - we had 3 suitcases unpacked and we were not about to spend hours packing up to move for a fee we didnt agree to! Apology from the font desk and another empty promise to have our room fixed. Day 3 - With nothing being resolved and when asking for a manager lead to more waiting we decided to cut our losses and put up with what we had for 2 more days. Now for the food. Holstines is a complete and utter mess *pun intended* Less than 1/3 of the tables were taken and they crammed the 2 of us - Both over 6 foot tall into a corner next to 4 intoxicated and obnoxious patrons. After not being able to sit next to my wife for 45 min due to the fact that one gentleman (overstatement) had decided to sit and extend his legs into my area of seating left, we were finally able to have a conversation with each other. We ordered the 2 Cheese burgers well done one with a fried egg. when we got them mine was fine, but my wifes burger was essentially fresh ground beef seared on each side for no more than 1 min. When our server finally came back she didnt know how to handle the kitchens mistake and asked us what she should do.... uhm.. How about go back to the kitchen and ask for it to be remade correctly to start? no.... she stared at me with a confused look on her face and I finally told her not to worry about it and that if she would be able to grab me a side of mayo for my burger. She walked away and 5 min later was back with what was supposed to be mayo and a poor attitude. We took the burger off since you didnt like it she said in a snappy tone. No miss you misunderstood me, I liked my burger, my wife just isnt used to eating bleeding raw meat..we just wanted it re-fired. She walked away, as I put a decent layer of what I was lead to believe was mayo onto my burger - Instead only it was Butter. I took a 4th bite into what had been a fantastic burger up until i gaged and spit out a mouth full of bun, Butter, ketchup and some egg yolk. The manager came around and Apologized for our service. We thanked him and left. The Next evening - our last at the cosmo, we decided to try the Chinese Mexican infusion place. At first the service was 200% better and it did remain high though our meal. But when it came to eating the food... McDonalds down the road serves higher quality food. Our Pulled pork taco *topped* with guac. was all guac with a little bit of pulled pork... pure agony trying to force it down. We also ordered the blacked shrimp...which came out looking delicious but ended in a crime against seafood - Over cooked and felt like chewing on a rubber dog toy... But we liked the service so much we only mentioned it at the end of our meal, the chef apologized and took it of the bill along with the tacos even thought all i said about the tacos was that they had just slightly to much guac but were other wise good just like our Cheese and Pork sausage dip. We tipped our server well as she felt bad but we explained it was not her fault. But when we mentioned our previous experience she told us that *between me and you* the cooks and servers at Holstines are atrocious and would not send even her family there. Unfortunately for the Cosmopolitan they set the bar fairly high when they first opened. Great Service, working rooms, VALUE... This seems to have all been tossed over the ledge in an effort to gain maximum dollars from paying guests and provide the least amount of service required, but just enough service to keep people thinking that things will change. Being a travel agent I have a substantial client base, a majority of them work for the oil patch and in the oil sands in Northern Alberta. Money is not a concern for these folks, and when asking me to find them the best hotel on the stip... From this point on I will never send anyone to The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. Oh and for those \"Extras\" were were supposed to receive... on the last day we found out someone had put a 50 food and beverage credit on our room but ... forgot to tell us.. Way to go Cosmo. Way to look after travel agents and especially one honeymooning. As I said before - We gambled at Bellagio and Aria, ate there, and even had comps given to us for being on our honeymoon. The Cosmo didnt even ask to see our marriage certificate. No one at the Cosmo cares, and everyone that reads this review should stay somewhere else. The Cosmopolitan has MAJOR making up to do if they ever want AMA travel agents to send their clients there. The only way my husband and I would stay there again is if it were comped. Which is what Aria did for us and we didnt even STAY there! Excellent work MGM Properties! we will be seeing you again this summer.

There are blinds on the bedroom side of the shower, but it was uncomfortable knowing that if I took a shower with anyone else in the room, they would see my silhouette through the blinds. The lighting in the room is poor and always seemed too dark. One of the bathroom lights was burnt out and not fixed the entire 3 days we were there. There are snacks available in the room. They are in a box and you are told if they are removed (even to read a label) they will be charged to the room. The restaurants are pricey, breakfast and lunch costing in the $15-$20 range, or even more at the buffet..

Everything went wrong except for check in and check out. When I first arrived I had the bell hop take my bags and give me a ticket and told me to call the front desk after check in .

It took over a hour after the call to get my bags.I did not have cell phone reception in my room and had to use the balcony outside to make cell phone calls. I also called front desk to mention that there was not any phone or TV available. They said they were having a issue with the computer network and it should be resolved the next day. Well the next day late afternoon after exploring the sights of Las Vegas still no phone or TV. They explained that they were sorry and would change my room . Plus I told them that housekeeping did not remove room service breakfast dishes. I told them I had a tour scheduled that evening and wouldn't be back till 11pm. When I came back dirty dishes were still in room and they said they didn't have a room available with phone or tv and would get someone to pick up the dishes. At this point I left this pIace and went to play games at Aria, stayed up all night and when I came back the next morning dirty dishes still in room. I called room service for breakfast and I was told it was an hour wait this was at 7am. I ordered a double espresso. An hour later I got a double espresso decaffinated said they were out of regular espresso. (Dishes were finally picked up) Who ever heard of double espresso decaffinated?? Extremely frustrated and in tears with everything going wrong I went to the front desk they said they would give me two nights free stay and 200 comp for dinner.

An espresso place for the morning. All are plusses. Now for the negative, in the 17 times I have stayed here, never once has my room been completely ready when I got to it. There have been several times where there are no towels, none. Beds have been unmade upon arrival which is just not ok. The Tv's rarely work correctly and if they do, you need to cherish the moment as they won't work for long. Yet, being a glutten for punishment I continue to return. On my last trip, I checked in, was charged an upgrade fee (not normal for a Marriott platinum guest) and was \"upgraded\" to the room I normally get for the same price. Ok, not a huge deal as the nature of an upgrade is a gift, not a given. I arrived in my room to find that there was an empty champagne bottle and two diry glasses on the balcony along with cigar butts in the ashtray. It was late, I opted to go to bed and just ignore it as I I had mentioned, I keep coming back for more. At 10p I notice the message light is on so I call down and check messages. I am told I have no messages, no biggie, techology is not a huge thing for the hotel. At 5a, my phone begins to ring. At 5.30, my door is opening and a security is standing in my room telling me I missed my wake up call. I tell him I did not have a wake up call. He stares at me while I am in bed and then says oh and leaves the room. I am up now at 5.30a. I attempt to put my toothbrush etc away in the bathroom drawer only to realize that in the drawer is a used makeup, false eylashes, tooth brush, and garbage from the previous guest.

I do this and manager comes out, apoligizes by comping the room which was a great gesture as I told him. I told him really I didn't care about the money, although I appreciated it, however what I really needed was someone to just clean the room. He assures me that he will personally see to it that the room is cleaned top to bottom. Great, seems alert, seems like it is finally going to go well.

(If you don't stay in your room at night, this is hardly a problem--but for those of us who want to sleep at night, it can be difficult.) The restaurants in the hotel are really not quite as wonderful as they sound. We found most to be so-so; my husband, however, really liked the Wicked Spoon, their buffet. It is not cheap ($22 weekday mornings and $28 on weekends plus tax), but I can believe that it is the best buffet in Vegas. Our first visit was in the middle of the day, and the offerings were fresh and almost too numerous. Fantastic desserts in addition to dozens of other egg, meat and pasta offerings. It was also very crowded. Unfortunately, if you go early (before 10 a.m.), it is not crowded but the offerings are thinner than if you go later. Some of the dishes, like the bendicts, looked as if they had been out for awhile. They have sushi and other Oriental offerings at this hour--which I would think is a plus for the international guest. At a price of $22, it compares favorably to other Las Vegas buffets. Unlike other Marriott properties, there is no free coffee in the mornings. The rooms have a microwave and sink, but no coffeepot. There is no lobby coffee other than a $4 cup from the bar. That was one of the things that drove us to the restaurant early. We had two cups the first morning and realized how much we were spending just for coffee and decided to abandon our usual custom of having several cups of coffee before breakfast. Overall, I think that the Cosmopolitan lives up to its name. It is enormous, sleek, modern and ostentatious--without appearing to be so, if that is not a contradiction. We have already visited twice and probably would go back again if the price were right.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cFun!!\u201d", "Author": "Carla H", "ReviewID": "UR123908476", "Content": "We were there for our honeymoon almost a year ago, and the whole place is amazing to look at, luxurious-feeling, and fun.

Our conference had 1100+ attendees and the hotel was large enough to have rooms for everybody, I think, who wanted to stay. I had a studio and I was astounded at the space and room it had. It had an extremely large bathroom, with a large walk-in marbled shower with a rain-shower faucet, a large jacuzzi-style tub, a sitting room with a large sectional sofa, table, chairs, and a desk. The kitchenette was functional, but for a studio, it was disappointing that there was NO Coffee POT!! Also, no dishes, silverware, or even a real refrigerator. It had one of those mini-bar fridges. The digital age has taken over here. There were TWO TV's (one a 50\", one a 32\") that let you control everything from the fan-speed and room temp to selecting a massage or spa treatment. Bed was comfortable but the pillows were the king-sized, down pillows and were too tall for me. Most of the staff were very accommodating and I was especially impressed when I forgot to clear a wake up call one morning and when I didn't answer because I was in the shower, a gentleman came to my door about ten minutes later to be sure I was okay! The terrace was a great size with a comfy chair and table, but my view was of the city center and the MGM grand, not the lovely view others had from the other tower over the Bellagio fountains! Overall I was more than comfortable and taken care of in my room. I was offered a grade up, but since my company was paying the bill, I elected to save that $25 upgrade. The conference appeared to be well taken care of as well, except the food wasn't delivered efficiently the first day. Long lines at two buffet tables wasn't workable for this large number of people. AND they ran out of coffee continuously at the breakfast lines. Not good for a bunch of nurses! I ate only once at a hotel restaurant, Comme' Ca' and it was delicious, if more than I'd like to pay.

The room was new and generally quite nice if not a bit odd in it's layout. The sitting area was just... weird and went unused. The only real complaint about the room was the air conditioning. There was not really a central AC. the only vent was a large one in the corner and despite setting it to 66 deg, only that corner ever seemed to cool down. the rest of the room including the bathrooms was always pretty warm. Kind of odd for such an upscale hotel. But the amenities overall were pretty nice. I like the location. Walking distance to many other local destinations. great choice of onsite dining options - loved Scarpeta. But honestly, if you're not into trip hop, loud thumping music and lots of youngsters, this may not be the place for you. It's a scene. Friends of ours (much younger ones) who went to STK for dinner even commented that the experience was a little over the top - great steak but the DJs spinning loud trippy tunes was a tad much even for them. We went to the club there (Marquee) with a group. Despite our special access, I cannot fathom why people would go there. It's so ridiculously overcrowded with bodies and attitude that it killed the fun. I mean pushing through shoulder to shoulder crowds just to move around is not my idea of a good time. Honestly, it had to be some kind of fire hazzard on the main level. I guess I compare Cosmopolitan a bit to other newer hotels like Wynn/Encore, which is new, funky, stylish, has a great (and roomy) club and just generally delivers at a much higher level overall.

Check in was quick, even with a high volume of people checking in at the same time. We self-parked out rental car. Self-Parking was easy to find as it is well marked and leads to an underground parking garage. We never had a hard time finding a parking spot. Parking was free. Elevators require a room key to access the floor your room is on. Our room had two queen beds that were very comfortable with soft pillow tops and comforters. The bathroom was huge!! I think 30 people could have fit in the tub and shower area. The shower was easy to use with and adjustable shower head (if you could reach it). The tub was large and deep with side bubble jets. When we checked in, there were hairs in the tub and sink area. We also found a parking receipt behind the night stand from November 2011. So cleanliness may not be up to standard. My one compliant about the room would be its lack of a chest of drawers. There were only shelves in the closet for folded clothes, but there were plenty of hangers. The room environment is controlled through the TV or phone. This is fine, but it took the phone 20 minutes to turn itself on and program itself before we could use it. The TV and phone is also how you access the front desk, and review your room charges.

Here's what I experienced: My reservation was a bit unusual because I decided to arrive early and pay for a night with points before switching to paid nights. This meant I had 2 reservations in the system with 2 different room types. I was expecting problems upon check in, and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't an issue at all. Check in was easy, seamless, and they processed both reservations at the same time so that I didn't have to change rooms or come back to the front desk. Also, I arrived at 6:30pm on a Sunday, and there was no wait at all to check in. I did ask about a concierge lounge, breakfast, and complimentary room upgrade (typical gold amenities at all Marriotts), and was told \"We're not really a Marriott, we only partner with them.\" And so there were none of these. They said they only recognize Marriott Platinum members. I loved my room on the 58th floor of the West tower. It was large, had a sitting area, small kitchenette, working desk, huge bathroom with both a deep bubble bathtub and walk in shower. It also had a balcony with a couch overlooking the city. My favorite part of the room was the electronic controls on the touch screen telephone... I could press to control the entire room lighting, tv, music, climate, etc. The walls seemed thick because I never once heard noise from other surrounding rooms. And the bed was very comfortable. The kitchenette had a sink and microwave. The \"refrigerator\" was actually the minibar and didn't have space to put anything. I'm not a coffee drinker, so I didn't mind not having a coffee pot. I heated water in the microwave to make tea, and that was perfect for me. The room was clean and beautifully decorated. Housecleaning came every day, left plenty of clean towels, glasses, and changed sheets when I asked for it. I also saw cleaning people in the main hallways with brooms to clean the common area floors. I had been concerned about the cleanliness after reading some reviews, but was pleasantly surprised to find no problems at all. I was there for work, and was able to use the Internet (wifi was free in all rooms) and liked having a FedEx Office located on the 3rd floor. It was easy and convenient. I ordered room service breakfast almost every morning and found the food to be good. It was expensive ... Oatmeal for $8, Organic yogurt with granola and berries was $10, but not out of line for room service in other Vegas hotels. My only complaint was that a few mornings it took an hour or so to arrive (most of my orders were at 6am). I also dined in the hotel restaurants 2 nights, and really enjoyed both meals. The Scott Conant wine bar (DOCG?) was one of the best Italian meals I have ever had. It was good service, reasonably priced, and delicious homemade pasta. I did not spend any time in the casinos but in just walking past them while going to different parts of the hotel, it seemed to be a fun place to be. The hotel definitely has the \"hip\" factor, with large artwork-style electronic screens in the lobby area and in the elevators. Those are entertainment in and of themselves.

Let me start out by giving the one and only negative comment that I will make. Be careful with your room selection. Upon checking in, I asked for a quiet room since we were there for fun, but also to get some rest after some busy times at work. We were assigned room 1906 which is at the end of a hallway, but it is also located on the same side as the nightclub. On our first night, we went to the room at 11 p.m. and we immediately knew that our room location was a mistake and that we would not be able to sleep due to the loud music coming from the club. We were able to be moved that night to a room which was on the other side of the hotel and which overlooked the Bellagio fountains. This room was very quiet and enjoyable. Now, on to better things. We arrived early on a Saturday morning and after checking in went on a return visit to the buffet. It is a bit more expensive on weekends and the price does not include an alcoholic beverage as it does during the week. That being said, it is still a wonderful buffet and well worth the cost. Every choice of food and dessert imaginable is available and delicious. The staff of the hotel was very friendly. We never had a problem with the cleanliness of the room or our request for extra towels. The casino staff was again very friendly and made game playing very enjoyable. All in all, this is a great hotel and we will be back. We will just be a bit more careful in room location.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSwanky\u201d", "Author": "Yenism", "ReviewID": "UR123646121", "Content": "We booked in at the Cosmo before we even thought about getting married.

Upon arrival the people at Cosmo made us feel very welcome and the lady at the front desk kindly upgraded us to a nice room with a view of the fountains. This made our stay and our special day at the Cosmo very special. The room was brilliant and we loved the gadgets and little things like large coffee table books, bathrobes, slippers, little box of treats made it a very nice touch. (I'm a graphic designer, and I work in publishing so appreciate the books in our room). The hotel has a very vibrant, modern feel and i wouldn't say its catered for the young. I think whatever age you are, you will enjoy this hotel. The only negative thing about this hotel is that the minimum bet in the casino was quite big. But understandably its probably because they didn't want any old riff raff coming in. However they could consider putting a table or two with $5 dollar minimum bets. As not everyone is comfortable playing $10 or $25 dollars bets per go. But not a big issue as, as it was on the centre of the strip it was easy to go anywhere.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cHorrible Customer Service Beyond My Belief\u201d", "Author": "Randy H", "ReviewID": "UR123629245", "Content": "I sent the below letter to the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas on Jan 12, again on Jan 19 and again on Jan 23, 2012. They never bothered to respond back to me. The letter was as follows: To whom it may concern: If you are not the person who handles guest complaints, please forward this to the person who does so, thank you kindly. I just wanted to write to tell you about my horrible experience when I stayed at the Cosmopolitan Las Vegas on 12/31/11. This was my second stay at your hotel for 2011. I reserved my wrap around terrace suite on 10/02/11, paid a grand total of $1,344.00. I put in the request box when I made my reservation that I wanted a very high floor, a view of the strip and of the Bellagio fountains. I came to check in on 12/31 around noon time. The person at the front desk told me that the room I requested wasn't ready yet but they will call me soon when it becomes available. I double checked with him to ask if it was in East Tower, high floor (above the 50th floor) view of the strip and Bellagio fountains. He assured me it was, no problem, so I was very happy. I then gladly checked in my luggage and went off to have lunch waiting for a call to come back to get my room. Around 2pm I called back since I have not heard anything yet and guest services told me that the person previously in that room that I was waiting for had just checked out and that housekeeping was getting my room ready. I waited for another hour and still no call back yet. I called guest services again at 3pm and they told me the same thing so I continued to wait longer. At 4:30pm I still did not receive any return call so I went back to the hotel to inquire at the front desk as to what had happened with my room. I understand that official check in is 3pm. They told me that there was no such room available with a view on a high floor. As you can imagine after waiting for 4 1/2 hours and finding out that I have been lied to all of that time I was not very happy. The manager told me all they have left is the west tower with a view of the back, not at all what I have been waiting for. When I asked to speak with his supervisor, he told me he was the highest person there and that I could not speak with anyone higher. I believe he was just an entry level floor manager and didn't want to give me his supervisor's name. I regret that I do not remember his name. He should not be working in a management position or even as a front desk clerk due to his extreme lack of professionalism and rudeness. With all that being said, I finally got a room on the 18th floor, ES 1893 around 5pm. When I arrived to my room, the electricity was out in half of the room. The TV's did not work and the phone in the bedroom was not working either. I had to use my cell phone to call the front desk to ask for somebody to come up and fix these problems. Somebody came up promptly to fix the electricity and the TV's but the phone was never fixed. He told me he would send somebody else up to fix the phone. Nobody ever did show up to fix the phone. I never really need to use hotel phones anyway so I just let that problem go and felt that now I can just relax and enjoy my vacation after waiting so long for my room. Then I decided to put some bottled water in my freezer to rapidly chill it and to my surprise the freezer was not working at all. I checked the temp setting and it was already set at the lowest. However the temp in the freezer was just room temp. Next, I decided to put the hotel glasses in the dish washer to sanitize them before using them and once again to my dismay, the dishwasher would not work either. Finally, I needed to use the bathroom. That was really the last straw. Low and behold the light in the toilet in the master bathroom was burned out. When you close the door, it is pitch black in there! Doesn't housekeeping or anyone else check for these things? At this point, I just feel that I was ripped off for this stay. I believe that there is a very serious problem with management at this hotel, especially after reading some of the reviews on various travel web sites about other guests complaints. If this is the way management is going to run this hotel and not even offer the guest an apology, I don't think I will ever stay there again. When I stay at the Bellagio, Aria or Vdara, they treat me wonderful and I never had to go through an experience like this. When I checked out of the room, I told the person at the front desk about the above problems and that I hope they are fixed before the next guest stays there because I felt bad if somebody else has to go through that same awful experience as I did. Her reply was \"it is new years weekend\". I think that shouldn't be the guest's problem at all. An efficient hotel knows how to flex up and handle matters and take care of their guests. Her attitude was, I think, that she didn't even care since she really didn't seem interested in listening to my concerns. Thank you for listening.

The rooms are spacious with outside balconies. The beds are extrememly comfortable and the showers can only be described as massive (if you are someone who like to share a shower with a special someone). My room, a one bedroom, in the East Wing, on the 57th floor had a Japanese soaking tub, which is basically a very deep tub without jets. I had a sitting area that I could hold meetings in with up to 4 people and had 2 large flat screen tv's. The room lights are totally automated and you can control them from your room phone. The check-in was above average and the people truly friendly. This hotel is now owned by Deutche Bank who took it in foreclosure and there is a Marriott relationship so you can use points or earn points. The workout facility is quite good, but costly. There is one in each tower (15ht and 14th floors). I did see a few other rooms. One person that was with us got a corner room that had a wraparound balcony and luxurious is almost an understatement. He was also in the East Tower. This hotel was originally supposed to have condos in them. The West Tower is a different story. It is a more common Las Vegas hotel room, but they were also very nice and quite spacious, with large bathrooms, but not quite as nice as the East Tower. The views are great, so don't pay for a strip view unless you really have to have that view or they put you on a low floor. I was there for a convention and the convention food was good, but seating is weak if you want to do meetings. I had breakfast in the hotel and found it above average for hotel food. I did not have any other meals in the hotel, but I was told that the greek restaurant was quite good. The casino itself is relatively small, but sufficient and it is a bit of a walk to the East Tower elevators. You can get any room in the East Tower and be near an elevator; that is not true for the West Tower. Overall, I was very pleased and would definitely go there over the Bellagio.

As you can imagine, our agendas could not have been more diverse. Not some sordid tale of Vegas vanity, but an anecdote of a January 16th stay at the Cosmopolitan for a mother and son during a recent cross country odyssey. Despite our divergence in age, objectives, and interests, we both agreed that the Cosmopolitan was a fantastic experience, one certainly worth repeating. We arrived with significant trepidation thanks to many of the reviews on Trip Advisor. Cleanliness, technological glitches, and attitude of the employees were all of concern. But the decision to stay at the Cosmo (commensurate with the activities of the evening) was high risk, high reward. Our hotel room was spotless, the television room controls were functional and intuitive (no different than operating a standard DVR), and the employees we experienced were as friendly as they were helpful. Bluntly, we experienced none of the difficulties of other travelers. We were greeted by impeccably clad hotel staff. David guided us through the check in process. His suggestions for activities, shows, and dining options were largely catered to the grounds of the hotel, but he went above and beyond to suggest options that were not exclusive to the Cosmopolitan. The room itself was a well groomed artifice of interior design proficiency. Modern fixtures accented a classic blue on white color scheme which provided a comfortable setting rather than that of a cold unwelcoming modern art exhibit. The television controls were intuitive, and if you've ever had the occasion to use a DVR, you will be competent with the room controls in the remote. Even my mother was able to use them without much difficulty. For techno-phobes, there are independent controls on all the room accessories so that you do not need to rely exclusively on the technology provided. The bathroom possessed two sinks, a spacious shower, and an independent room exclusively for the toilet. Extra is the operative adjective in the restroom, extra towels, extra lotions/shampoos/soaps, and extra space. After a show, dinner, and gambling it was back to the hotel to rest for the next day's travel. Rest was made incredibly simple upon retiring to the room. Two well apportioned and incredibly comfortable queen beds house more pillows than I've ever owned. All shapes, sizes, and any level of fluff one could possibly desire. Rest made easy. We only ate at one of the restaurants. Breakfast at the Henry was complete with Austrian Jams for toast, and provided the full complement of savory and sweet options. I enjoyed my Sausage and Cheese Omlette, and my mother particularly enjoyed her Oatmeal. Even three days post Vegas she made mention of the oatmeal, a particularly good sign for such a fastidious diner. Admittedly, I've used quite a few glittering describers in the paragraphs above, but leave the most positive for the talent wondering the hotel grounds. This might just be the attraction of the hotel itself, but any single guy who bypasses this place is a fool. Even the dealers at the Craps table said, and I quote, \"It does not suck to work here.\" I have never been in the presence of such a high number of gorgeous women in one small area. Though initially intimidating, the surroundings are incredibly enjoyable for any individual with a healthy appreciation of the female figure. I did have a great experience, but in full disclosure, my experience may have been colored by the fact that I left the Casino several hundred dollars the richer. Take that as you will, but it bears repeating that the experience was one without problem in which the facilities were impressive as they were comfortable.

We thoroughly enjoyed the room that we had - West Wing balcony room overlooking The Bellagio Fountains. I must say that the bed was THE most comfortable I have ever slept in, anywhere in the world we have previously travelled to and also including my wonderful bed at home. I suffer from back problems and am often in discomfort when waking. Not with this bed. We also especially liked the Japanese plunge bath and the view of The Strip from the bath. Having a balcony was definitely a bonus, as was the huge lounge area. The decor, furnishings, bedding - all top quality. However, a few negatives - * only 1 bathrobe; requested a 2nd; broughtly promptly * no slippers; none available as hotel had run out * dirty sock left behind on balcony * inconsistent cleaning - everything cleaned well but on 2 occasions housekeeping left cleaning supplies behind when finished; another day, not enough towels were supplied; some days we got shampoo, conditioner, soap et al but on other days we didn't * no free internet / wifi; before booking we checked and were assured that this was available; directory in room states availability; this has changed but has not been updated to reflect changes. Was able to send an email from the business floor but at an outrageous cost - $10.40 * one reading lamp in lounge area was broken; took 2 phone calls over 2 days before being attended to * TV not working in lounge area; had to call maintenance * while there were kitchen facilities, there was no cutlery, crockery, etc, nothing; again this information was out of date. Inconsistent information supplied by a variety of staff members. I wanted to make a cup of tea in the microwave and was told that there would be a charge if I requested a cup; same for a pot of hot water and a cup from room service. We did eventually receive 2 mugs at no cost. While these negatives were minor, we did feel that it detracted from the high standards of what is obviously a quality hotel (which is also reflected in the price paid).

First off, it's currently the most-talked about hotel in Vegas. If you want to be in the middle of the action surrounded by beautiful people, this is the place to go. The restaurants are all world class (although nothing really casual, all pretty high end), the view is the best on the strip and Marquee is currently the hottest club. It's located right in the middle of the strip, with easy walking access to several other hotels. This hotel also has some of the largest terraces I've ever seen; first time I've ever had a terrace in Vegas, which was really nice. If you get offered to pay an additional per night fee for a better view (ie, the Belaggio fountain and the Paris and the strip), pay it. It's worth it. However, I agree that the service is subpar as others on TripAdvisor commented. I stayed for 3 nights recently and the room was not cleaned one night! It was a holiday weekend and we were in and out of the rooms at off times, but I would think the hotel wouldn't allow that to happen. Just gross. I don't recall ever even seeing a maid or cart in the hallway. Also, quite frankly, the gaming at the Cosmo sucks. There are a limited number of tables compared to other hotels, and the minimums are very high. If you stay here and want some proper gambling, head next door to the Belaggio. Also, the sportsbook at the Cosmo is more like a sports kiosk. Very unimpressive. In short, if you're under 40 and in Vegas to hit the restaurants and the clubs, then this hotel should be at the top of your list.

Our favorite was Chandelier Bar. * Breakfast/brunch @ Wicked Spoon - cheaper during weekday, of course. But bring a hearty appetite! Soooooooo much food to choose from and very good too! * Although not a Marriott property per se, they do recognize the Marriott rewards program.

The bathroom had a large walk in shower that led to a sunken tub big enough for 2 and floor to ceiling windows looking out over the strip and into the bedroom.

We stayed for 3 nights over New Years Eve and for a birthday celebration and booked a premium studio room with views of the Bellagio Fountain. We were staying at the Four Seasons beforehand but we wanted a balcony for NYE. We arrive at the hotel just before 3pm only to be told that there was no rooms left available apart from a downgrade to a standard city view room and no compensation. Even though we had emailed the hotel 2 weeks beforehand to confirm the room. After various conversations with the receptionist to say we were not happy and we would stay somewhere else giving the money we had already paid, she went away to speak to the manager and confirmed they are able to give us a much better room. So up we went carrying our own luggage and got into the room, only to be disappointed that the room was a studio room with no view, so we were still downgraded. Looks like the receptionist lied to us to cut the conversation short. Tried to call reception from the room, but phone wasn't working. So down again back to reception we went, queued again and argued our case and still no luck but they compensated us with a food and beverage voucher, which was useless as it did not compensate what a premium rate we paid for the room and we would not have stayed here if we knew our room type was not guaranteed. Don't bother emailing or calling up in advance your requests before your arrive, seems like they will acknowledge your request but do the opposite to what you want.

We got fantastic massages at the spa and the spa facilites are quite large and very luxurious. We spent an entire afternoon at the spa because it was so wonderful.

We sat and sat and sat and finally around 11:30 pm Stevie made his appearance. I think the concert lasted about 30 minutes, Stevie left the stage and returned for 3 more songs. Mind you these concert tickets were $280 each!!! I agree with the other reviewers regarding the costs (nickel and dime-ed me on every friggin' thing) $15 for internet DAILY, $40 to use the steam room EACH DAY, $25 to use the exercise room EACH DAY. This place was absolutely ridiculous--WE COULD NEVER GET OUR ROOM CLEANED, and when we did, money was stolen from our room! We reported it and made an appointment for security to come to write a report--THEY NEVER SHOWED.

Background to the hotel is that it's the newest Hotel on the Strip, in a perfect position right next to the Bellagio and opposite Planet Hollywood. It's also part of a new development on the Strip that includes \"Aria\" and the Crystals shopping mall - referred to as \"The Centre\". The Cosmo is aligned to Marriott, however don't expect all the reward benefits if you are a gold member - I got the room upgrade (to a very nice 63rd floor suite), and free Brunch in the Wicked Spoon. Platinum members naturally get a few extras on top. Like most hotels on the strip it's incredibly close to the airport - 15 mins by car / taxi. First impressions are pretty good - it's a big hotel, although without the \"themes\" that make up a lot of the strip properties. Inside the focus is on design - video walls everywhere showing art in the reception, with an army of front of house staff available to check you in via iPads (worked very well). Very European feel to the place as well - music playing was classic club tracks mixed in with European \"Indie\" music. I got the impression straight away that this hotel was pitched at the younger Vegas crowd - the 25-45 kind of age range. The gaming hall is large, well appointed and has several bars in it - Vesper and Bond being my favourites. I wasn't there really to use the Casino's - but you have to at some point I guess. Walking through the gamin hall you reach the Cosmo's centrepiece (for want of a better description) - the Chandelier bar. This is a pretty spectacular bar over the 1st and 2nd floor (with a mid level in it as well) that is set inside a great big chandelier. Looks fantastic, service, good, not THAT expensive and really needs to be seen 2nd floor houses a number of shops - mainly unique, design-focussed ones - couple of clothes shops, jewellers, a very good cook shop run by the hotel's featured Chefs and where you can buy top end bottles of wine and beer (at a price). Also a good coffee shop and a great little bar / resteraunt called Holsteins (Specialist in burgers and similar stuff like that). It's not haute cuisine by any stretch of the imagination, but good food, excellent service and the bar staff are great. The 2nd Floor also holds the \"Wicked Spoon\" buffet - in my opinion, the best in Vegas by a long shot (although the priciest) - I'll post a separate review of there though. The other main item on the 2nd floor here is the \"Marquee\" Club. Vegas (and North America's) hottest club at present. As someone who over the years has been to pretty much every major superclub going, this is well worth checking out (four story LED screens and projection walls line the dance floor) Be warned though, drinks are not cheap in there and the queue gets big when they have the feature DJ's there. Also, it helps if you're in the \"VIP\" section - otherwise it can be a bit cramped (fast talking with an English accent helped here). I went on a Monday night when most of the locals go, and it was packed but a really good night out. There's a large collection of high-end resteraunts on the 3rd floor, which I didn't try to be honest so can't comment - however I was told the Sushi resteraunt was amazing, but can only go off someone else's recommendation. The rooms themselves are pretty large and very nicely furnished. Mine was a mini-suite that had a king sized bed, separate living area with kitchen, huge bathroom with separate shower room and jacuzzi bath. Also, which I believe is almost unique for Vegas, is that each room has a balcony. I regularly travel with work, so am used to sleeping in different beds - but the one in the room here was the most comfortable I've ever slept in. Having said that, it's Vegas, so you're not supposed to be sleeping that much! Again the focus on design is obvious in the rooms - Phaidon books are scattered about the rooms, and the artwork on the walls and the detail in the finishing is all in line with the general vybe of the hotel - laid back, cool and pitched at the high end of the market. Be aware though that the mini bar etc in the room is obscenely expensive! I didn't try the room service, but that again looks pricey. Final part to this is the Sahra Spa - a fantastic Spa and fitness centre in the hotel. That actually deserves a separate review of it's own, but despite being pricey for treatments, is well worth a visit. In summary, the Cosmo is a superb hotel. From visiting a number of the strip's hotels it was my favourite by a long way. Only the Wynn comes close. Others (such as Caesar's or The Bellagio) are starting to look a bit \"worn\" and in need of a face-lift. The Staff are excellent, the food also very good. The overall vybe of the hotel is brilliant, and it's quite possibly one of the coolest hotels I've stayed in. It's not the best hotel ever - it's hard to be with 1200 rooms - but it's a proper 5 star hotel and I would not recommend any hotel above it on the Strip in Las Vegas. Look around for offers - the rack rate is high here - and would also recommend booking a city view (ie basic) room, and asking for the upgrade...", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Caldwell, Idaho", "Title": "\u201cYour all in one hotel/casino\u201d", "Author": "viajesmujer25", "ReviewID": "UR122440238", "Content": "Like every hotel there are good and bad points to them however there was def. more good then bad with this resort.

I'll give a breakdown to what happened to our room each day we stayed at this hotel. Day 1: We booked a 1 bedroom suite with a pull-out couch. We checked in at 10 am. The service for the check-in was ok. However, once we got to our room things began to go wrong. The bed wasn't properly made and the pull-out couch wasn't laid out. I called room service and asked them to change the sheets on the bed and also to lay out the pull-out couch such that a person could sleep on it rightaway if he/she wanted to. You would assume that the housekeeping at a 5-star hotel would know what to bring up/what to do when the guests ask to lay out a bed. Then you'll never believe that the exact words of the person who answered the phone for housekeeping was \"what would you like us to do?\". I had to explain that you need clean sheets, pillows and duvets for the bed. Then the housekeeping person said that they don't give duvets for pull-out couches. I told them I would like to request one then. Then the housekeeping person said they would have someone come up and make the beds right away. After this, we went out and didn't return to the hotel until midnight. When we got back, the pull-out couch was laid out, but there was no pillows or duvet on it. We looked in the closest, and there wasn't any pillows or duvet in it either. I called housekeeping again and asked them where the things were, and the person (it was a different person now) who answered the phone said that they don't have duvets for pull-out couches. I then said I requested one that morning. The person then said they had a large number of arrivals and they ran out of duvets. I asked her if they had more now. She checked something (computer?) and said yes they have more now. Then she asked me what I wanted her to do. I said I wanted pillows and duvets send to my room rightaway. She said that it would take at least 2 hours to have the pillows and duvets send up and do I still want them? She didn't sound at least a bit sorry that it was midnight and that it would be 2 am before we could go to sleep. I asked her why she didn't send up the duvets when they knew they had more and waited until now for me to ask for one. She said she doesn't know what to say. The pillows and duvets arrived 2 hours later and we had to make our own beds that night. Day 2: We left our hotel at 2 pm in the afternoon. When we got back at 5 pm, as we opened the door, there was a vaccum cleaner sitting near the bar of the room. There were 2 dirty clothes hanging on the back of a chair and some extra towels on the same chair (which was strange since all the towels in the bathroom were changed). At first, I thought maybe the housekeeper didn't finish cleaning, but he/she was nowhere to be seen and there were no maid's cart in the hallway anywhere. I called housekeeping and asked the person who answered the phone to check the status of our room. She said our room was cleaned. I told her what I found in our room and asked her if she could have someone come to take the vaccum cleaner and the dirty clothes away. She said she'll have someone come up right away. We left again and didn't come back to our room until 11 pm that night. We found that the vaccum cleaner was gone. But the towels remained on the chair and there was something else hanging on the back of the same chair now, it was a dry cleaning bag. Day 3: We left at 11 am this day and didn't get back until 10 pm at night. This time when we entered the room, the pull-out couch was restored to its original position and the duvet and pillows that were on it were nowhere to be seen. I called housekeeping AGAIN and this time the person who answered the phone said that it was part of the service to have it restored to its original position. I said we need duvets and pillows. He said he'll have it send up right away. Then 30 minutes later, a person comes to our door and handed us a bunch of towels (apparently he thought we asked for towels). We said we asked for duvets and pillows, he went away for a few minutes and then returned with them. We then made the bed on our own that night. Day 4: We left our room at 1 pm and came back at 10 pm. GUESS WHAT? The cleaning person never bothered to show up and our room was left uncleaned. I gave up at that point to reason with housekeeping and just asked them to send up some toilet paper, tissue paper and clean towels. The person who answered the phone said that they'll have the things delivered right away. I waited 15 minutes and no one came. I called housekeeping yet again and this time a different person answered the phone. I asked her about the status of our delivery. She said that the delivery time is 30-40 minutes and that she never heard the person who answered the phone earlier (who happened to sit beside her) say that the delivery time is immediate. Everyday we would leave our room and come back to find some kind of nasty surprise. And then we'll have to call housekeeping and they can never get anything right. Our vacation could have been better without us having to constantly call housekeeping and asking them to do the most basic services like making beds, change towels, etc. We figure if we stayed 365 days at this hotel we would get 365 different nasty surprises at the end of each day. Our stay at the Cosmopolitan hotel has been an extremely negative one and we would never stay at this hotel again when we visit Vegas.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201c3 day review..\u201d", "Author": "Jr8633", "ReviewID": "UR122432904", "Content": "Spa is small but nice.

I booked with booking.com and had a good deal, but in the weeks leading up to my trip I was tempted to change hotels because of some of the awful reviews I was reading. I am so glad I didn't! The hotel is wonderful, great decor throughout, I loved the lifts and the lobby area, and the random works of art dotted throughout the hotel. I have previously stayed at the Bellagio, the Palazzo and the Wynne, and of those hotels would gladly stay at the Bellagio again. However I like trying new hotels out each trip, but next time if I can get a booking I will definitely be staying at the Cosmopolitan again. When I arrived at about 3 p.m. on Friday afternoon there were no queues to check in, and I walked straight up to the reception desk where a very polite man checked me in. I had booked a one bedroom suite, and I asked him for a view of the fountains, and to not be near the night club. He said I had already been allocated a room, but he changed me to a room in the West tower on the 59th floor, overlooking the fountains and the Strip My room was spotlessly clean when I arrived, and the housekeeping was fine all week. I did not tip daily but left a large tip at the end of the week, so tipping had nothing to do with the quality. The one bed suite is large and feels luxurious. The bed was wonderfully comfortable with great linen on it. If I had a gripe at all it would be that there was no lamp over the desk at all, which made that area feel a little gloomy. There were large wardrobes, a safe, iron and ironing board, slippers and a robe. The robes only come in medium which is a shame, I used it but would have been more comfortable in a large robe, however housekeeping said they were only available to buy, not for the rooms. There was an eclectic collection of reading material left in the room, including a large book of Japanese erotica left on the bedside table. There were two large TVs, one in the living area and one in the bedroom, both worked fine. One of the lamps over the sofa was not working but it was fixed the same day that I reported it to housekeeping. The kitchenette was a bonus in Vegas as I have not had access to one before, however there is no cutlery or crockery left in the room at all. This wasn't a problem as was aware of this prior to packing, so made sure I put a mug and a set of cutlery in, as well as some tea and coffee. There was enough room in the mini bar fridge to stand a bottle of milk, and I was careful not to move any of the mini bar stuff as this triggers payment. A number of reviewers have commented that they found controlling the lighting via the television was difficult. I didn't find this to be the case, but you could also use all the switches or the panel on the telephone at the side of the bed. Although it was December having the balcony was lovely and I sat out on it for a short while most days I was there, looking down at the fountains. Room service for breakfast morning was great too, my food was piping hot and exactly what I had ordered. I can imagine eating breakfast out on the balcony when the weather is warmer, lovely! Another thing I loved about the Cosmopolitan is that the room seemed to have much better soundproofing than any of the other 3 Vegas hotels I have stayed in. I was never aware of any one in the rooms around me, nor could I hear people in the corridor, even though my room was adjacent to the lifts. I think a quality door on the room really helps with that. Finally, the bathroom - I love having a separate toilet cubicle even when I am travelling alone. The shower was hot and strong - an additional jet or handheld would be nice, but obviously not essential. I did find it a bit odd having to walk through the shower area to get to the tub - especially as I showered before I soaked in the bath. I felt a bit guilty about soaking as I know that there is a bit of a water shortage in Vegas, so filling a tub that would comfortably accommodate at least three people made me feel a little uneasy, although it was lovely. I lay in the bath looking over the fountains and the neon signs of the strip while sipping a drink and reading a book - wonderful. I also loved the casino - one gripe about all the casinos in Vegas is that they allow smoking, which I hate, as it makes my chest feel very tight. But this casino was better than some in that the smoke seemed to be cleared quite quickly. Also when you are on the slots or tables there are frequently people around offering free drinks - I have sat for 40 minutes in other casinos without seeing anyone. And I also loved the free Strawberry Daiquiris that were on offer, although I tried a couple of other cocktails too. All the staff at the Cosmopolitan were lovely and very customer oriented and the croupiers were no different, with a couple of them taking time one evening to try to teach me how to play craps (I didn't get it!) I have done a separate view of some of the restaurants I ate in, but I would say here that I don't rate the Wicked Spoon as much as others clearly do. It's fine for breakfast when there were no queues, but the only time I had lunch there was a queue for 45 minutes and the food was not as great in my opinion as others have suggested. The set lunch at Milos is much better food, and much better value. And the steak was far better in DOCG than in STK. Also having a pizza restaurant open for slices of pizza at 4 in the morning is a great idea, although there is a comprehensive 24 hour menu available for room service.

The challenge we've always had is staying at a nice hotel on the strip without any elite benefits, or staying at a lesser quality Marriott property and getting points and marginal-elite benefits. The Cosmopolitan is our perfect Las Vegas hotel going forward. We get to experience a luxury hotel on the strip that recognizes my loyalty as a Marriott Platinum. Even prior to our stay, we got an email from the Marriott Platinum Concierge (Nichole), and she included my request for an upgraded room as part of our 3 day / 2 night stay. Here's my review: CHECK-IN We arrived at the hotel around noon, and were promptly given our room. No hassles about us checking-in early or our room not being ready. Upgraded to Terrace Studio - Fountain View Room. We chose to take the 500 Marriott Points vs. the Platinum gift (tin of gourmet popcorn). The front desk clerk reminded us that as a Platinum member, we get 2 free BRUNCH buffets at Wicked Spoon per day. The buffet is from 8am - 2pm daily, so even though we were only staying 2 nights, we were able to use the buffet 3 days! TIP: Check-in using the special VIP/Platinum line to the left for a quick check-in. THE ROOM I had booked the City Room (least expensive). We were upgraded to a Terrace Studio - Fountain View room on the 50th Floor West Tower facing the Bellagio fountain. The views from the room of the Bellagio Fountain and the Las Vegas skyline were stunning. The room was luxurious and modern. Cosmo uses Bigelow & Co Bath products which my wife raved about as a former New Yorker. Free Wi-Fi for Platinum members (possibly for Gold as well). Cosmo will provide you with a generic PIN (passcode), and no need to provide your room number or last name when logging in, so you can share it with other non-elites staying at the property and use on multiple devices. THE FOOD The Wicked Spoon buffet is fantastic and the best benefit of this hotel. The standard rate for the buffet is $22 per person. As a Platinum guest, your breakfast/brunch meals are free for up to 2 guests and you can use the special Invited Guests/Platinum line. We walked up to the front of the line, and waited no more than 30 seconds before the cashier/host checked-us in. People who had been waiting in the normal line gave us nasty looks as we strolled up with no wait. Apparently, the standard line to the Wicked Spoon on that day was over 2.5 hours long! There were plenty of food options for all types of diets. The dessert bar was totally ridiculous. There were about 30-40 different gourmet selections and the highlight being the gelatto station with around 16-20 flavors. So yummy. TIP: Visit the buffet around mid-morning (11am). The crowds are lighter and you can combine a breakfast/lunch into 1 big meal! The Cosmo has great restaurants at different price points. The hidden pizza place was tasty and reminded us of the classic New York pizzerias. $5 per slice for the white pizza and $4.50 for the plain cheese slice -- best pizza on the strip. \"The Henry\" was a nice restaurant with beautiful decor and good food as well. Finally, we had lunch at \"Milos\" Greek restaurant one day. This place took us 45 minutes to get our meal. The food quality was good, but the service was slow considering the dishes are pricey. Milos not recommended. GAMBLING I did not gamble on this trip, as I was there primarily for work, and dragged my wife along to enjoy the room. The casino floor is beautiful and packed with tons of games. However, the casino floor was empty and very quiet, if you like that. We visited the Venetian and Bellagio in the afternoons, and their casinos were packed. Doesn't look like Cosmo's casino is doing very well. PARKING The parking at the Cosmo is so much easier than most of the mega-luxury hotels in Vegas. There are signs indicating how many parking spots are available in an area, as well as, red/green lights over each parking stall that tell you whether the space is available or not. The parking lot is huge, and the lights/signs save you time while searching for spot. TIP: The lower levels have the most parking spaces available, and park near the West Elevators for fastest access back to the front desk/west tower rooms/casino. CHECK-OUT I had a work meeting in the morning, and was not going to be able to check-out at the standard noon time. I called the front desk and asked for a late check-out, but they were a little hesitant to extend the check-out time. Front Desk connected me to the Marriott Platinum Concierge who changed our Check-Out time to 2:30pm. This allowed my wife to enjoy the room a bit longer while I attended to work. OVERALL In summary, The Cosmopolitan more than exceeded our expectations. Service was fantastic, great dining options, and beautiful rooms with stunning views. My Marriott Platinum status was extremely useful here, and made our stay memorable. We highly recommend The Cosmopolitan, and will be staying here again in the future.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Consett", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, perfect location on the strip, good restaurants\u201d", "Author": "John_Gregory", "ReviewID": "UR122357890", "Content": "The Hotel overall is great.

Very spacious and luxurious with a huge, deep bath. Very convenient and interactive service on the television, meaning you could keep a tally on how much you'd spent on your room, whilst also allowing you to check out via your television. The bad points : Check in was a farce. When we arrived, we were greeted with huge queues/lines, but then noticed that there was an electronic check-in facility on the wall, although curiously nobody seemed to be using it. I got all the way through the check in process, giving a ridiculous amount of detail (including my inside leg measurement), only to be told that it hadn't worked and that we'd have to check-in manually. No wonder nobody else was using the machines. After standing in a none-moving line for another 20 minutes, my girlfriend took the initiative and stopped a member of staff walking around with his iPad to ask if there was a quicker way to check in, and he subsequently checked us in on his iPad, as if that was normal. Why then, don't the staff make a point of actively doing this, rather than having to be grabbed? There was no indication that this was a possibility until we asked. We returned late one night to discover that neither of our key cards would allow us into our room, so we called reception from our friends' room to alert the hotel, who informed us that Security would come and let us into our room. After a 20 minute wait, Security subsequently turned up and let us in (after confirming our identity). We asked the gentleman why our cards weren't working, and he said that the key cards quite often stopped working, so we would need to have them re-initialised in the morning. Therefore, in the morning I went down to reception to have the key-cards fixed, only to be told that they had been disabled due to the fact that they didn't have our credit card details on their system?! I asked the representative how this could possibly be the case, after we'd already been there for 3 days. How could we have checked in without giving these details? He didn't seem to have the brain capacity to understand what I was pointing out to him, and kept repeating in robotic fashion that they didn't have my credit card details, so he wouldn't re-initialise the cards until he had this. In fact, he said he wouldn't let us back into our room until he had the credit card details we'd already given. I was made to feel like I was the one in the wrong and almost like I was a criminal due to an error that they'd made. I didn't have my credit card with me, so I had to go and find my girlfriend (she was having breakfast with our friends) and return, only to find that there was another huge line for me to join. Luckily, I actually managed to see the same representative and gave him the credit card (that they'd already had), which fixed the situation. I asked why this happened, to which he stated (after having had half an hour to come up with an excuse) that my credit card company must have frozen my card. I didn't buy this, and have subsequently spoken to my credit card company, who confirmed that this wasn't the case. All the way through the process, he was aloof and unapologetic. In hindsight, I should have spoken to a Manager, but I was so keen to just fix the problem, that I just wanted it sorted. Oh, and to add to it, he insisted that they'd \"tried to get hold of us\" to inform us about the amazing disappearing credit card details , even though there weren't any messages on our phone. Pathetic. Also, if you're thinking of going to the nightclub, Marquee, don't bother. It's tiny, and nowhere near the \"huge\" capacity it boasts, made even smaller by the ridiculous amount of cordoned off areas for \"VIPs\".

The hotel absolutely needs to work on improving their level of service. To me, spending between $250 - $325 nightly on a room ensures a certain level of service. NOT necessarily @ The Cosmo! Our room was dirty when we checked in; dirty with old towels on the floor, unmade bed, garbage in the kitchen, etc. We called the front desk immediately and they required we come get a new key to a different room.. No additional help with baggage, no real apology. They did offer a $25 room credit, but our morning coffee delivery was $26 so this really isn't much. The housekeeping services did a poor job once we had checked in and throughout the duration of our stay. Plus, one day we had a bad of snacks previously purchased (crackers, pretzels, etc) taken from our kitchenette. After calling the front desk to report this missing personal property, they basically explained that \"there was no way to track the missing bag and shift change had taken place so they had no way of knowing who to talk with.\" Their total lack of concern upset me.

The room is really beautiful but that doesn't mean we would be back. Service is lacking, but all of the staff is very friendly. We stayed here mainly because we got a great deal (booked in Sept. for 20 percent off.) They ended up charging my Visa twice but Geoff in reservations fixed the problem, apologized and gave us a $50 food credit. Good thing because everything is expensive when it comes to food and drinks. 1. Parking - proceed to the lower levels to save time. You can get a spot closer to the elevators and avoid the cluster on B1 and B2. There are green lights and red lights for each space to indicated availability, which was nice. They also close down the garage after it's full if they have an event going on, so make sure you are aware of this if you will be coming or going during this time with your car. 2. Check in -- very good for us. They did give us an upgrade to a fountain view room, but I wouldn't pay the extra for this. There are huge columns in the lobby that change to different scenes throughout the day. When we checked in it was Xmas trees and snow, really beautiful, but at night turns into their hip and modern night scene. 3. Room -- First thing I do is check out the condition of the bed. There are NO matress pads on the beds. I called (only to be put on a hold for a long time) and they said housekeeping would be up to put on the matress pad. I left, hubby in room, came back and they still hadn't shown up, so I called again and was put on hold for a long time and then was told, \"They are bringing up a BLANKET that you requested to put in between the sheets and the matress.\" I said that I did not request a BLANKET but merely a matress pad. Then I was told that they DO NOT put a matress pad on their beds. Kind of strange, if you ask me. Oh, the doors on the rooms are annoying. So heavy and a lot of slamming, which gets on your nerves. for me anyway. BUT the rooms are beautiful, spacious and well-appointed. 4. Service -- phone directory features different departments that you supposedly hook up to but the off-site call center doesn't want to connect you to anyone, constantly asking what they can do for you instead of connecting you to the requested department, so their \"Beck and Call\" button is pretty much useless. They put the customer on hold unnecessarily. This needs to be addressed, in my opinion. 5. No coffee, but features a microwave so you can bring your own cups and have instant, certainly not the best, but it works. Otherwise, I think coffee was four bucks downstairs to go. Good coffee -- Illy's brand. (Can only drink so much instant.) There is also a McDonalds across the street. 6. Wicked Spoon -- called to get a wait time. No anwer so the infamous call center comes back and tells me it's a 25- to 35-minute wait. Okay. Great. Go down, stand in line a LONG time, so I call the Call Center (that's what you get) to inquire about the time to see what they would say while I was in line. They said, it's an hour to hour and a half. At this point, the line is much shorter than when I arrived, so I don't know where they get these times. So I go up front and the lady says that the wait time is two hours. Whatever! Go stand in line and suddenly the line moved very quickly and ended up waiting less than an hour. The buffet was okay. There was a lot of items missing because they ran out and had to refill them. Not a bid deal for me. The prime rib was inedible, but the next piece was pretty rare so it was more tender. The ham was dry and cold. The service was excellent and they give you bottled water. It's 22 bucks for brunch and 32 for dinner. We were at brunch. The best thing about the brunch buffet is the gelato stand! The pistachio gelato was so delicious! 5. Hidden Pizza - level 3 East Tower right by the sushi down the hallway. First time I got just the mushroom pizza, so crispy and thin and cooked to perfection. The next night I got meat on mine and it was a total grease mush -- YUK! Never went back. But it's the cheapest place to eat if you're desparate and not wanting to spend a lot. 6. Spa and fitness center -- Ray who works there is so nice! The fitness center is great and swanky and I liked the isolated areas to workout. Bring your headphones if you wish to watch TV on the treadmills and such. The spa I used only for the steam and such. It's 20 bucks/day for fitness or 50 bucks for a three-day pass. Another ten to enter the spa area each time. The spa was okay. The lady that was working there was not so friendly. A woman came in for a treatment and they got into a debate about the price. 7. Casino -- too expensive and never heard any hootin' and hollerin' that someone was winning. If you are a gambler looking to just play for some fun and whatnot and not a high-roller type, I personally wouldn't choose this place to gamble. Table limits high and machines are really tight, and geared for maximum profit for the casino based on number of play lines you have to play and such on their lower-limit machines, like pennies. 8. Location -- we didn't like the location. You have to walk too far to get to other casinos (not that I'm opposed to walking), but it's not that convenient. Going across the bridge to Planet Hollywood and across the strip, we became victims of time-share \"talk.\" I wanted nothing to do with it and it was pretty hard to get the lady to accept NO for an answer. Then there are the losers on the bridge wanting money and playing music and the poor doggies they had with them! It was disturbing to see doggies in this environment. One guy had a sign, \"Smile if you play with yourself.\" How dumb! 9. Check out -- I didn't see my food credit on the bill on the TV, so I called, again placed on hold with the \"call center.\" Was told to go downstairs. I said, I'm not waiting in line. She said, You don't have to there's a line for check out. I've never seen a dedicated check-out line but ventured down there anyway. Sure enough! No check out line and a huge line. So I got someone to help me without standing in line and they did. Checked out on the TV after I agreed with the bill. I had picked up some items on the tray by mistake (a package with a screw on it that turned out to be a condom.) I didn't know what it was. 10. What I really enjoyed about the hotel -- minus the call center and the location -- the room, music in the elevators, the upbeat atmosphere, the beautiful stunning architectural detail throughout and the staff (still very friendly.) That's why it cost 3.9 billion dollars to build it! 11. Pets -- I was told the pets were 50 bucks for the ENTIRE stay and not per day. We were going to bring our little yorkiepoo but we didn't. There is a deposit of 250 and was told we would get back 200. I would suggest printing out a piece of paper having them sign it after they inspect the room. I would prefer that than have them say the dog damaged the room or whatever and charge your card. At least you will have proof for the Visa company that the room checked out okay. 12. If you're my age -- over 45 -- and you want to feel older, stay here. All the women going to the nightclub (which seems to be the main attraction of this property) are dressed to the nines, most are pretty good looking, have decent bods, and it makes you feel a bit out of place, but that shouldn't stop you from staying here. Now, I'm in pretty good shape myself, but I didn't like looking at them everywhere. 13. As odd as it sounds, we still prefer downtown. We stayed in the Rush Tower at the Nugget for two nights previous to our moving to the strip. It is very crowded on that strip. Downtown is so much easier and way more convenient to get food, gambling, etc. 14. If you have a car and want to venture out, go hiking out at Red Rock Canyon. BUT, once you enter the park, you are subjected to a one-way drive 13 miles long. There is a fee to enter (I believe seven bucks). There is Calico Basin right before the entrance to go hiking. But it's really nice out there. There's also the Red Rock Casino on Charleston, which is really nice, with a food court and the usual Starbucks and stuff, and it looked like some really decent reasonable gambling there. 15. There's a Ross on the strip between MGM and the Harley Davidson store, for all the people who are Ross fans. I am! Kind of messy, but good values there. 16. ABC liquor store inside the Miracle Mile Shops directly across the street. There is a Walgreens right across the street, but it's not opened yet. 17. Ate at Mon Ami Gabi inside the Paris -- delicious Lamb shank dinner and reasonably priced.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver BC", "Title": "\u201c2nd time around got worse..

I was looking forward to be back in Cosmopolitan Hotel only to be greeted by their horrible service. Our first room ( see picture ) was dirty. The bathroom floors had hairs on it. It was very gross. The bathroom tiles had shoe marks . Toiletries were missing. I asked them to switch us to another room and least thing they can do is to bring the new key up but as per Resort Services it will take them 20 minutes or more so it's best to get them downstairs... (PS having to wait during check in..... I can't believe I have to go down again ) Our 2nd room - mini bar was missing items... i called to request for slippers unfortunately they ran out. It was okay they were out except the resort service person had to add the line \" we ran out because we had a large group of people \" Am sorry but my reply to this excuse had a tone ( I was already tired by this time) I don't think this is the right excuse. People make reservations/ bookings so that the hotel can prepare and know how many people are expected to come in today. It is to ensure that they have enough supplies and staff. Next day- I came back to our room around 6pm & of course.. room wasn't cleaned! Again- doesn't matter if you have 3000 rooms in your hotel..you can't stay you guys clean rooms until 8pm... really ?? If this is the case, Hire more people right ? It's not cheap staying in this hotel. Request for a housekeeping or any supplies... it will take them an hour to bring it up. I thought after being open for a year.. things will improve from last year. Unfortunately it even got worse! I recommend that if you wish stay in this hotel because of the location - i suggest Try ARIA. we stayed in Aria after our 2 terrible nights in Cosmo. They are next to each other. Service is excellent. Rooms are cleans. Enough Housekeeping to clean your room on time. After a long day from walking and having a great time.. it's good to come back to a clean room ! Oh yeah the day we were checking out- Housekeeping knocks on our door at 9am asking if they can clean our room ?!?!?!?? I don't think management and staff are in sync in this hotel.. seriously. Also note... when we were checking in - the person next to us was complaining about the room. In addition - a family in the elevator was talking about how things are not working properly in their room. So I know am not the only one having issues that time.. I guess Cosmo is not generating enough revenue to keep up with it's promise. So if you still decide to stay in Cosmo .. i wish you Good Luck !

Appaling customer service throughout the hotel. Poor attention to detail. Tries so hard to be hip but misses the mark. I would not stay here again, there are those mentioned below that score much higher. I've been to Vegas 5 times now in four years. Once on a stag trip and the rest with my wife. We've stayed at different places each times (MGM, Bellagio, The Wynn, Aria) and this time elected for The Cosmo. Firstly all previous hotels were fantastic, great spectacles of grandeur as soon as you walk into the lobbys. The Cosmo didn't really have the same effect. Whilst the LCD screens were cool, you didn't really feel you had entered somewhere special. Check in was a bore. After a 10 hour flight from London, the last thing you want is to wait 15 mins in line in order to start checking in. When our turn came up, the desk clerk ignored us and turned his attention to another guest who had cut in from the side to ask questions. First impressions go a long way and can often set the tone for the remainder of the stay. Despite this rudeness and the clerk's lack of customer recognition, we spent a few minutes checking in. I have to point out here that on the day we checked out, we heard one of the bell staff telling another customer that the checking in process is protracted. Anyway, about the room, not a touch on the Aria! Firstly the bathroom had some poor finishes to it. No bathroom scales, no shoe mitt, no shoe horn. Not that I care but a lack of attention to detail. This radiated over to the room control panel. It was built into the phone, which made it very awkward to use and couldn't be moved around. Also it lacked functionality; where was the curtain control. At the Aria, I could set climate, lights, tv, radio and curtains from one panel and have any combination come on as a wake up call. Again no attention to detail. The worst surprise was awaiting us in the laundry bad...dirty men's underwear!!! I can only assume it was dirty as I don't believe The Cosmo was handing out clean Hannes jockeys. When we called \"beck and call\" we're were asked what they (The Cosmo) could do about it! How about sending someone up and taking the damn thing out of our room! A few other bashes: The complimentary buffet was not worth queuing 1 hour for. We had it once and then choose other places to eat instead. Our toilet got clogged on the second day, which they did fix. At checkout we were charged wifi for the day we were leaving too, damn cheek! They awkwardly apologised. The good: Holsteins burgers Jaleo Such a shame as these aren't even controlled by The Cosmo.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southlake, Texas", "Title": "\u201cFirst Stay - Last Stay\u201d", "Author": "KenSouthlake_Texas", "ReviewID": "UR122319845", "Content": "First Stay \u2013 Last Stay. We went for Christmas weekend. Instead of the Encore where we had stayed our last four visits to Las Vegas, we thought we would give the City Center a try and chose the Cosmopolitan. This was a big mistake. Very poor customer service. No one on staff ever smiled. 1. Bell Staff. No one available to assist. It was 5:30 on Friday, 12/23 and they were not busy. 2. Room Service. Immediately called for a bucket of ice to chill two bottles of wine. Informed it would be $45 and about an hour wait. They suggested I use the ice machine on the floor. 3. Room Layout. Mini-Suite. Terrible. Bed next to balcony. Sitting room next to bathroom. Great view from balcony of Bellagio Fountain but nothing except the bed to sit and enjoy it. Also a long walk in the middle of the night. Whoever made the decision on layout was on drugs. 4. Housekeeping. Left the room at 9:00 am the first day and the room was not made up at 6:30 when we returned. Call to \u201cBeck and Call\u201d took 5 minutes to answer and they were not sure when they could have it serviced. Left the room on day two at 9:00 am after calling housekeeping that we were leaving. The room was not made up at 1:30. Another call to housekeeping said they would be there in 30 minutes. They arrived only after I found a supervisor in the hall. 5. Common Areas (Check-in, Casino, Hallways). All very dull and gray. Electronics might be interesting if you were going to a modern museum but did not set you in a mood to have fun at a five star \u201cResort?\u201d. See three above. Designer must be on downers. 6. Checkout. Tried to checkout from room TV. $75 resort credit was not posted and an incorrect mini bar charge was discovered. Call front desk. Told I had to come down to check out. When I arrived at the front desk, they asked why I came down and did not checkout from my room. 7. Holiday decorations. None. Perhaps they thought celebrating Holidays might offend someone. 8. Concierge Service. Could not answer question regarding which restaurants had special Holiday menus. Suggested we go to each location and look on their menu boards. FYI. We did stick our head in the Encore / Wymm while we were there. They made us understand the gravity of our ill-fated decision to stay at the Cosmopolitan. Both the Encore & Wymm were brightly decorated and went all out for the holidays. We were greeted with smiles and welcomes. Whether gaming or dining, everyone went out of their way to treat us like guests. The comparison between the Cosmopolitan and the Encore is unbelievable.

We had a fabulous view from our 40+ floor balcony, which overlooked the City Center and the south part of The Strip. Our room was clean and orderly. Although, we noticed that they had only given us one bath towel and one hand towel. Fortunately, house-keeping was walking our floor so we were able to get additional towels quickly enough. Toiletries were ok, although the cap for new mouth wash bottles kept coming off even with a security seal. Weird. A couple of other reasons why I gave 4 stars, vs 5: 1. there was no coffee maker which we thought was extremely odd for an ultra-modern resort hotel 2. the in-room safe did not work, and when we called Reception, they said they would need to call Maintenance which would take another 2hrs. 3. see above comment about the towels 4. our room door jammed once, and housekeeping had to help push it open 5. you could hear pounding music late at night from the club even 40+ stories above 6. checkout took almost 40 minutes, even though we were checking out early Sunday a.m. Overall, we had a positive experience at the Cosmo, esp at the price point we had.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ellicott City, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cA great new addition to Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "SigEpGov", "ReviewID": "UR122296564", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for three nights just before the New Years craziness.

We did have a fountain view at the Bellagio which was exciting, but after a visit to Cosmo...we checked out the next morning and checked into the Cosmopolitan. The hotel is very swanky, beautifully decorated with lots of chandeliers and pretty things to look at including people. The gambling was not great for us but as foodies we were winners. Blue ribbon Sushi is incredible. I love how some of the restaurants are stating this fusion of cuisine. My husband had the Tiger Roll and I had fried chicken, both plates were amazingly delicious. We actually do spend time in our room in Vegas and really enjoyed having a balcony which I think is unusual in Vegas. It gave us great views of the mountains and the strip...we enjoyed hearing the hustle and bustle of people and cars on the Strip without actually being down there. Our only issue with this hotel is that they were upgrading the internet service or something to that effect during most of our stay.

He was so funny, friendly and helpful, he really went the extra mile for us. We had booked a premium view terrace studio with 2 queen beds. After going up to the room, it slightly smelt like cigarette smoke, so I went down to ask what else they could offer. Jonathan surprised us with a free upgrade to a terrace suite with fountain view. It was absolutely amazing!! Full kitchen and dining, 2 bathrooms, laundry, separate living and bedroom and oversized terrace with an incredible view. Couldn't have asked for more! As there were 4 in our group they kindly brought up 2 rollaway beds for the other 2 guests which easily fitted in the huge suite. We had breakfast one morning at the Wicked Spoon and the buffet selection was huge! the biggest range of food I've ever seen. Way to much to even consider eating but a great experience.

The hotel itself is beautiful and impressive. We enjoyed our stay overall but were not impressed by the level of service at the hotel. The Cosmo is a resort to behold! The public areas of the hotel are comfortable and well designed. We loved the modern and colorful d\u00e9cor. The guest rooms are large, livable and very luxurious. The suites contain every modern amenity including two flat screen televisions, a huge bathroom with both a shower and tub, a very sumptuous king size bed and a private terrace; ours had a view of the Bellagio lake and fountains. The Service at the Cosmopolitan fell short of our expectations. The first of multiple service letdowns started at check-in. I had requested a quiet room when making the reservations. The agent assisting us at registration told us the hotel not very full and getting us a quiet room was no trouble at all. We checked in, went to dinner, had a few drinks and then hit the casino. After returning to the room late at night we discovered that the suite was right next to a mechanical room and the service elevators. In addition, our room had multiple housekeeping issues: the mini-bar was empty and dirty; there was trash on our terrace and many long black hairs in our shower. The next morning I called down to the front desk and requested a room change. We were given a new suite right a way. The new room was very clean, had a fully stocked mini-bar and was in a very quiet location. Unfortunately our second room was plagued with phone problems. Neither phone in our suite worked. When I needed to call the front desk to request a late check out I had to use my cell phone and call the hotel\u2019s main line and be connected to the front desk. We did enjoy breakfast each morning in the Henry Restaurant and cocktails in the evening in the Chandelier Bar; the service and food and drink at both were great. Overall the Cosmopolitan is a beautiful hotel that still has some work to do when it comes to service.

And nothing better than the secret pizza place for a late night snack. The downsides, watch out for the mini bar like other posters discussed. Got charged as I touched a few items--had to have my host remove the charges. Also, the buffet is getting stale--seems like the same items day after day--no daily themes/specials. Since they are now going after the older casino crowd some of the hip entertainment seems to be disappearing. Finally the folks in the new Talon high limit lounge appear to be a little arrogant. I guess it's their way of saying I don't belong. After $40 for 2 drinks, they were right. If you're playing at least $500/hand then of course the drinks are free.

I was very interested to find out if the hotel would keep my good opinion. I arrived quite early on Sunday after moving from the Tropicana. As in June, staff roamed in front of the registration desks; however, each was now armed with portable computer pads which enabled them to quickly look up reservations for people as they waited at the head of each line to approach the front desk. If so helped, the customer could be checked in/checked out on the spot and the line would move that much faster. I was one of the people who, due to the timing, got to approach the front desk. As I had in June, at the time of my reservation I had requested a room in the West Tower on a high floor, facing the Bellagio fountains. While I had been accommodated in June on all points, on this trip I would have to pay an extra $250 for a premium view. Ah, well, no thank you. The clerk also tried to (gently, I'll grant) convince me that, on the 65th floor in the East Tower, I shouldn't be concerned with hearing any noise from their club, Marquee. I merely smiled and stated that I would prefer to wait until a room in the West Tower opened up. He seemed to understand and, after a short search, had a West Tower king studio on the 35th floor held for me; I would be notified on my cell once the room was reported clean. I puttered around the casino (table limits seem to be still out of line compared to Cosmo's neighbors) and played some video poker (which was much nicer to me this time around, although my winnings went straight to my brunch at MOzen). The Cosmopolitan had moved around some of its art pieces between the casino and the restaurant levels, but I did notice that the \"artful nudes\" video panels appeared to be no longer in rotation. The pool tables were still there though, free to play, along with loads of books and plenty of comfortable seating areas. I was scoping out potential restaurants when I received the call that my room was ready, less than two hours after I had checked in. As this was the same type of room as the one I had in June, I won't go into the actual layout and decor again. The view, of course, was different: not bad at all; my balcony was almost directly opposite the Veer towers of CityCenter, with a clear view of MGM on the left, with Monte Carlo and New York New York between Veer and Aria. The housekeeping situation during my stay was much improved since my observations in June; everything was kept spotless, all amenities and towels renewed and there was a general but perceptible sense that serious attention was being paid to cleanliness. I also had slippers in my closet this time. The technology of the room and the hotel still suffers from quirks. I was able to book dinner at STK through the TV, but not a treatment at Sahra Spa. As in June, whatever I booked still did not show up on the TV's Itinerary feature; although, again as before, the reservation was indeed made and on the venue's computer. I had between my two trips purchased my first smartphone; however, between these two trips the Cosmopolitan decided to charge for its formerly free WiFi. Boo. Oddly, when I had dined at Milos earlier in the week, I was able to use Cosmo's WiFi for free. Throughout the stay, I had some difficulty actually connecting with any mobile network, depending upon where in the hotel I was, which did not seem to arise anywhere else on the Strip. Identity Players Club - I'm not certain what to make of their loyalty program. It seems quite easy to rack up points, even for a non-gambler (which I am, at least at Cosmo's casino); it takes 100 points to redeem one dollar in comps. Points are immediately registered at slot machines. For transactions at, say, its restaurants, the points might not appear on the account for at least 24 hours. And one has to check out, then wait 24 hours, before any points appear which were earned through room charges, including the room rate itself. One particular Identity perk that is advertised is \"you can get a free night after staying just 8 nights at The Cosmopolitan\". This is a little obscure. It is not an automatic or a free comp; The Cosmopolitan simply estimated that the Identity member would rack up enough points, in an eight-night stay, to \"pay\" for one night, if desired, out of his/her points. Although I had stayed 10 nights total, the automatic delay to credit my account from all of my room charges accrued during this latest stay meant I didn't get to point-pay one night off my bill after all. But I did have enough already to point-pay for dinner at STK. Sahra Spa and Hammam - I booked the HydraFacial again; since not much changed from my last visit, except that the hotel has since installed hooks on the backs of the doors in the ladies room stalls, I won't post a second review. One item I will note - During my tour I particularly did ask about the Hammam, about which I've read but had never seen. The spa's website claimed the Hammam was open to the spa's patrons at certain hours. However, the attendant informed me the Hammam area was only for those customers who book one of four treatments. With this, Sahra falls even further in my estimation, far below Qua or even Aria. Those spa areas were more extensive than Sahra's and also had better perks such as heated stone beds and larger pools. Aria's unisex salt room also was not kept closed to most of their spa patrons either. Bars - The Chandelier, particularly its third floor, is a can't miss for the great-tasting and full-strength cocktails, extremely creative, knowledgeable and friendly bartenders, and its ambiance. Unfortunately, Bond was a bust, being, in contrast, very bright, loud and smoky. The servers were either oblivious or downright rude; an unpleasant surprise considering the rest of the hotel staff at every level were completely the opposite. Restaurants - Between my two visits I've managed at eat at almost all of the restaurants housed at Cosmopolitan. For this trip, Holsteins wins the gold star for its food and service; Blue Ribbon Sushi and China Poblano (the Mexican menu this time) tie for silver and STK gets the bronze. The jury is still out on Estiatorio Milos. Secret Pizza was not in the running and I won't post a second review of the place, but I did notice that the slices were narrower than last time, while the prices went up a bit. The Cosmopolitan remains my new favorite place to stay on the Strip. The place does have lingering issues with its technology and, in one very rare case, its service. I remain underwhelmed by the spa's facilities and probably won't return there, even though the treatment was great. However, those issues weren't even a speed bump in my overall continuing enjoyment of my stay at the Cosmopolitan. As I'm a minnow, even plankton, in the gambling arena, I do appreciate being able to \"earn\" comps at this hotel through its Identity program. So, as long as I can book a decent room rate, I'll continue to stay here. I'll definitely continue to eat and drink here.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201chotel\u201d", "Author": "kalagapp", "ReviewID": "UR121815727", "Content": "Gorgeous hotel, but expensive.

I had two phones, an iPad and a laptop and couldn't connect with the outside world until I was standing outside the hotel. (it's pretty ridiculous that they wouldn't offer free wi-fi for as much as the rooms are.) Especially for a high tech room that allows you to control basically anything from the t.v..including the lights. Almost a little too high tech for the average guest and I am definitely not a stranger to technology. The fridge is completely full of mini-bar items but we were able to strategically place our late night snacks in various places. The wine cooler is a pretty nice feature we used often. Can also house other liquids if you run out of space in the fridge. :) . The one thing I don't like that hotels are doing more and more of is not building a door between the bathroom and bedroom. Even if I'm with my husband it doesn't mean I want to listen to him shower if I'm trying to sleep. There is a second full bathroom complete with a shower which really came in handy. The room really was fantastic and more than I expected! The only disappointing thing and it was huge to me, is that I have to agree housekeeping SUCKED! when we arrived the room was spotless after that it was like they came in and simply made the bed each day. The garbage wasn't emptied, the floor wasn't vacuumed (we left an item on the floor purposely to confirm our suspicion), towels weren't replaced etc. etc. Forget about the balcony, there were old cigarette butts we discovered the day after we checked in once the sun came up. We did complain but really didn't expect anything to come of it. Other than that it's a great place to stay with great people and that is key for me. Everyone is going to have their own opinions on the decor, layout and service - I had an awesome time and loved the hotel!", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City, Utah", "Title": "\u201cBlood Stains & Double Charged\u201d", "Author": "OhWils", "ReviewID": "UR121746842", "Content": "This had the potential for such a great review.. Now, I'd recommend staying close & walk over for nightlife. My issues: Room looked great when we arrived. While getting ready for the night with a friend sat on the end of the bed and the blanket runner fell to the floor, exposing a lazily-hidden blood stain on the comforter. We immediately called for a new comforter, were promised it would be replaced immediately, & left for the night. Had a great Vegas night - Cocktails @ Chandelier, Sushi @ Blue Ribbon, Party @ Marquee. In no condition to inspect room we slept in the bed. Woke up are realized the comforter was still disgusting. Called the front desk to insist on a change when housekeeping came, were promised it would be replaced, & left to brunch & shop. Returned to room at 6PM to find that housekeeping never cleaned our room, the bloody comforter was still there. I took a picture and showed it to the front desk. They made excuses, offered an F&B credit & said it would immediately be replaced, we left for cocktails. After a few cocktails, roughly 2.5 hrs later, I ran back to the room to pick up forgotten show tickets. Comforter was still there, room was still mess. I tweeted the pic & blasted Cosmo during show. They responded & finally cleaned room and took care of comforter. Sad, that such a simple request took a public plea before I could get it fixed. Double Charged - I've been on the phone with them trying to get a double charge for the room removed. 1 CC was used to make the res, a different CC was used at check-in for \"incidentals.\" They charged both & are being VERY difficult.

The rooms are of a very good sized. It features a queen sized bed, lounge area, small kitchen area with microwave, dishwasher and cupboard space. It features twin vanity unit, separate toilet, walk shower and bath tub. The room also features a balcony which is rare in Vegas and provides a nice outdoor space. We had a view of the Bellagio. Overall, there is little to find at fault with this hotel. It has a wonderful feel to it (smells gorgeous too!). The buffet breakfast (which is on occasion included in the rates for International travelers) is amazing! They have everything. Full buffet breakfast and not what you would expect in a US hotel. If you wish you can purchase this locally for approx. US$25 per person which is excellent value. The staff were very friendly and nothing appeared too much trouble. The location of the hotel is excellent. It is 'central' on the strip. You can purchase a travel pass for US$7 per day or US$20 for 3 days to jump on and off the bus which runs up and down the strip. There are all the usual places to eat and drink. Great shopping can be had at one of the 'out of town' locations at either the North or South of the strip and the bus will take you here. Cheaper than paying full price in the many shops close by for designer clothes. Lots of 'tickets' booths close by to purchase last minute tickets for the various shows which are always on is Las Vegas. Overall the Cosmopolitan is a great hotel. You get what you pay for and I feel the hotel overall provided great value. The only thing I was surprised about at this hotel was you had to pay for wifi which was about US$25 a day. If this was included it would make a stay even better. It would suit anyone but would be aimed at a younger crowd. Any questions please feel to drop me a line and I will do my best to answer them.

I got a ridiculously good deal by signing up for their promotions online, especially when the Bellagio, Venetian, and Wynn were all charging $80-$200 more for the same nights' stay. If you're thinking about staying here, please politely overlook the bad reviews because I didn't experience anything less than outstanding in service, comfort, and value. The lobby and Vesper Bar are so sexy I could sit there for hours. I'm an architect and went crazy over the flashy and sophisticated interiors, from the bars to the ceiling fixtures and even the elevators! They really paid attention to all of the details and added some fun quirkiness too. It's so urbane and unlike the fakeness that is the typical Vegas themed hotel. Big tip: once you get there, sign up for their Identity Membership (their player's card), because you rack up points when you eat, shop, gamble, and buy anything in the hotel. They gave me about $20 in free playing money in the short stay I was there! My 53rd floor City Room was very nice, overlooking the fountains (no upgrade charge). I read reviews about horrific housekeeping and tech-issues, but I encountered none at all. The room was in perfect shape when I arrived. The phone and tv remote both controlled the lighting, climate, music, etc perfectly, and it was very easy to pick up. The phone's Beck and Call number was great to have, they promptly took care of matters and arranged things. I stayed on a Saturday night (when Marquee is open) and was high enough that I hardly heard any noise, and when I thought I heard it, it was no louder than someone walking by in a hallway, so nothing to distract from falling asleep in the comfy bed. Dined at the modern French brasserie Comme Ca, which had some amazing dishes (must get the bone marrow with oxtail jam, beef cheeks, and raw bar). It was pricey, but very satisfying and a great atmosphere. The Wicked Spoon beat out the Wynn as my favorite buffet of the trip; it's a must do. Holsteins was also pretty good, just some small flaws and an expensive bill. The casino is very posh, but I noticed that it was less busy than most of the others I visited. It may be their higher table limits and that their main draw as a hotel is great restaurants and one of the most popular nightclubs in town. Most of the people were exploring their lobbies and public spaces. A lot of people have complained about service being either pretentious or rude. My check-in \"co star\" was so polite and great about getting me a room with a killer view. Housekeeping was great and worked around my schedule. The bellmen were helpful too. All of the waiters/tresses at the restaurants and bars were enthusiastic about food and really enjoyed working there. I'm so glad I finally got to stay here!

There was a soaking tub in the bathroom with a window to the view. The tub was very slow to drain and there were some cleanliness issues with the room. The carpet was a little crunchy in spots, the bathroom could have used another glance by housekeeping. The doors in the hallway were fairly scuffed up already. We checked in around 11am and left our bag with the bell staff and were told they would call our cell phone when the room was ready. We were given a set of keys that would be activated when the room was ready so there would be no reason to return to the reception desk. Around 4pm we received the call, retrieve our bags and made our way to our room. We were also able to check out via the tv in the room and were able to skip the lines altogether at reception. We had dinner at China Poblano and this was truly the best meal of the trip. We weren't very hungry going in so this was a perfect choice for us. Tip--When leaving the hotel for the last time we took the elevator to the 2nd floor (conference center) and walked through the floor to get to the East elevators.

The slots are not anything exciting (although they do a better job of keeping them clean than at, say, Imperial Palace. The restaurants are spendy but delish.

I called two days later to ask a few questions about the incident and spoke to the director of risk management, Brian Ruckert. He was so incredibly rude to me, very condecending, and talked down to me. I could not beleive it considering I was the victim of a crime. He even said that my boyfriend was the aggressor. Really? Because the thief was the one who went to jail, two other people witnessed the entire thing, and it was caught on the surveilance tape. He made it abbundantly clear that he did not care one bit about guest safety. Had the casino's security been more vigilant they could have prevented the crime in the first place, because the snatcher targeted me and watched me for a good 20-30 minutes before commiting the crime. An employee at the table even said he saw the guy standing around me trying to work his way into the table.

By 11h30pm, it was louder. I kept my composure and called the concierge desk and they said \"Oh it's going to go till 4am tonight and tomorrow night\".

When I asked to speak to the general manager to switch to a quieter room, he said \"the hotel is fully booked, so we can't switch your room\". This was TOTAL BS, as Vegas hotels do NOT fill up easily, and when I went online to book a sample room for that night, there was plenty of availability in the hotel. I told him he could give us a cheaper room, that a DOWNGRADE as long as it's QUIET, was totally ok with us.

The rain shower was sizeable and connected to an oversized tub that had a window with a skyline. We only had one draw back in the room.

However, we did not venture to Marquee (day club and pool). The line was always long and filled with young beautiful people. There is a separate pool that is much calmer. We did eat at STK which is in the hotel. FANTASTIC!!!.. It is probably the most fun I have had while dining out. The food was great and the atmostphere is club like. We had a late reservation around 10pm. The place was packed and the music was loud. So do not go here if you are looking for a romantic evening. Months later we still talk about STK.... Great Fun.

Good thing about the room: fantastic view of the strip and the fountains. Toiletries, loved that stuff.Really comfy beds. Bad things about the room: everything else. Cosmopolitan is a very new hotel, opened in 2010 or 2011. The suite looks tired. It's also very small for a suite. They have this crazy lighting system--you control lights in your room via TV. You have to know it. Otherwise, you will ave to figure out the way to turn on/off every single light in your room. On our last day of stay the entire computer system was down, so we could not set up a wake up call, turn off/on tv, do e-check out or even obtain our last bill--they actually asked us to write down our e-mail so they send us a bill. OUR ROOM WAS NOT CLEANED FOR 3 DAYS!! On the first day we came back to the room at 3 pm and it was not cleaned so I had to call. The next day we came back at 4 pm and the room was not cleaned, I called again. I gave up on day 3. Our suite had a sink with a bar. I had a cup of tea one night and left my cup in the sink--it was rinsed. The maid did not wash it and did not put it back. Also, there is no separation between the room and the bathroom. I guess whoever thought of it thought it would be very romantic--one can climb from the bathtub directly to the bed. There is a shade, but no wall. What can seem romantic at night, might become uncomfortable in the morning. A little privacy? We did have a fantastic view of the fountains, but the windows are not sound proof. One night we went to bed early--we had a very busy adventurous day. Heard the fountains all night. Also, the closet light goes off automatically after you shut the closet. So it was on for about 10 minutes after we shut down all lights, shining brightly. The best thing about the hotel is its location, the restaurant (breakfast and brunch are out of this world!), and its bar. The barman was so good--he made us cocktails based on what we told him, and every drink was perfect. I think the architecture is unfortunate. There are 3 pools in this hotel, and 1 of them is a waste --it's 1 inch deep. I'm not kidding. It's meant for standing with your drink. The problem is that during the day the desert sun will be killing you as you stand in the middle of the \"pool,\" and at night women tend to wear nice shoes... Also, there is a definite identity crisis going on with this hotel. Not sure if they were going for Hollywood glamor look (chandeliers are very sparkly!) or the 1980s (gigantic stiletto shoes and other sculptures, and lot's of bright red). The restaurant looks like it was built in the early 1980s--dark and hopelessly brown, with hints of Chinese design. The younger crowd that does not care about finer things in life will find it spectacular. The rest of us will just laugh.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot for fuddy duddys.

I was attending a conference for travel agency owners. As the owner of an agency named [--] I was not only looking forward to the conference...I was looking forward to seeing this new hotel about which I had heard so much. I always check out a number of factors at hotels to see if I would book my own clients there. I have been to Las Vegas many, many times and although room sizes and the level of luxury are different depending on the hotel, I somewhat have the attitude of \"You've seen one Las Vegas hotel, you've seen them all\". This was not the case with the Cosmopolitan. The only thing I had heard in advance was that the customer service at the hotel was marginal. In my case, I could not disagree more. As a travel professional I am the first one to know that sometimes things do not go perfectly. What I watch is how the hotel handles it when things do not go as planned. After a friendly, prompt check-in I went to my room to discover I did not have the type of room for which I had paid. I went back to the front desk. I was not angry in the least, I simply ask the front desk person to see if I was in the correct category according to what I had paid. She noticed that I was not...and without any further questions, sent me to a room that was a step above the rate I had paid. That is customer service. Further, the wait staff at the conference meals was very friendly, professional and didn't forget that ice tea that I had ordered when everyone else had their wine (one of my pet peeves at most banquet settings). When I departed the hotel, one of the doormen came up and told me that he had made special arrangements to take me to the airport. I had not done anything...I think he was just trying to be nice. So we got a nice towncar ride to the airport. That too is customer service. The rooms were extremely pleasant with lots of space, amenities and extras not seen in most other hotels. Being a \"tech\" guy, I particularly enjoyed the television set that also served as the \"brains\" for the room. From the TV remote, I could turn on or off all of the lights in the suite, adjust the temperature and do just about everything else. And the big plus for me was the balcony. Very, very few rooms in Las Vegas have balconies. The room was very clean. I've never said this before when staying in Las Vegas...but I actually wish I had more time in the room so I could enjoy it. For those planning a conference, I have been to dozens of conferences in Las Vegas. In most cases, conference attendees have to walk what seems to be a quarter of a mile from the room elevators to the conference center. At the Cosmopolitan, I took the room elevators to the third floor and there was my conference. Another big plus in my opinion. If I had any one compliant at all it would be the music in the casino. I am well aware that the Cosmopolitan caters to a younger crowd but the music played was clearly not my style and the volume was well above what I like to hear. All in all, as someone in the travel industry and someone who has stayed in most of the major hotels in Las Vegas, I would have to say that if I had a choice I would return to the Cosmopolitan...primarily for its location, for the room benefits and for the customer service.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cStylish on the strip\u201d", "Author": "Cupcakedujour", "ReviewID": "UR121324365", "Content": "Cosmopolitan Las Vegas We checked into the hotel promptly at 5 pm. \u00a0Front of house staff guided people through the queues, to keep thngs moving, and provided water while we waited our turn. \u00a0This was very well handled, and pleasant. \u00a0 Unfortunately, upon arriving at our room, we were very \u00a0surprised to find that it had not been made up at all!

Although I would love to rate this hotel a 5 there were many things lacking. First off, I love the fact that they allow dogs for just a 280 dollar deposit, 50 they keep as a fee. This is main reason I chose this hotel. When I originally booked the room I informed a representative my dog was also coming. She welcomed the news and told me that they'd lay out a puppy pad and dog bowls and I was pleased. However when I got to my room, they didn't give us any of these things. Plus the carpet was dirty and dusty. I have a extremely furry 8 lbs dog and you can imagine what a dirty floor does with her hair and what kind of nasty things she could be eating. When I rang house keeping they apologized but I didn't receive my dog bowl till later that night so I had to dispense water in a small cup for my dog. Thank god I brought my own puppy pads just in case. There was no possible excuse, we checked in at 3 pm and I informed them of my dog a few days earlier. I booked a Terrace one bedroom suite so the view was amazing and the room was spacious. What annoyed me about the room was it has a dishwasher, microwave, but no soap next to the kitchen. Its interesting how they never changed out my dogs bowls even though I left them in the sink, but they didn't even give me the resources to wash them with, even though I had the tools in the room. What angered me the most was the Wicked Spoon Buffet and my service there. The hotel menu states they open at 7 am but the manager stated they've been opening at 8 am since March of 2011. People build their schedules around such information especially with a plane to catch. In addition to misinformation and lack of proper apology, they also let people cut in line, allowing for regulars to gain entrance into the buffet through the platinum line. When I talked to the Manager about this, she sort of accused me of not knowing what I was talking about and asked me if I was mistaken (wanted proof). I told her that I heard one of her cashiers inform a customer that they were standing in the platinum line w/o platinum status but let them pay and enter the buffet anyways stating \"it's okay\" when there were clearly 25 people waiting in the other line. I guess we could have done the same thing and cut, and then offer proof saying we cut the line, but i figure that would invalidate our point. Suffice to say, the manager was dim-witted, she could not handle the situation properly and gave us short of an explanation and perfunctory speech about doing things better in the future. Well I'm really glad that you'll do better at the cost of my time and experience. She seemed more defensive then apologetic, which really bugged me. She made us wait for the hostess, instead of taking us to a table. So I was originally going to give this hotel 2 stars but Christine at the check out desk redeemed the whole hotel! I'm a kill them with kindness kind of person and informed her of my inconveniences and she was sincerely apologetic and showed us that by deducting a 100 bucks off our stay. It doesn't take a lot to satisfy me, I would have been fine with a 50 dollar discount, but Christine was really nice and personable. She turned my mood around 180 and left me with a \"these things happen, its okay\" attitude. I don't expect hotels to be perfect, but I would like staff to genuinely care about my stay and comfort.

From the front desk agents, to security guards to bar and restaurant staff. Everyone was friendly and helpful and pleasant. Even the guy at the taxi stand friday and saturday night (the busiest, and arguably most annoying times of the night), was incredibly friendly and made small talk as putting us into the cab. I find this unusual, as most taxi stand people outside of casinos during busy times tend to be surly at best! The bad: The Cosmopolitan has partnered with Marriott so that Marriott rewards members can take advantage of the benefits of their program at the Cosmopolitan. The front desk agent did not offer the benefits I was entitled to as a Marriott Platinum member. The good: The rooms were great - the pictures on the website are accurate and I was impressed with how well appointed the rooms were. I also found there to be very nice small touches like stationary in the room, charming doorknob sign, and interesting art and wall paper.

This could have easily been a \"Terrible\" instead of a \"Very Good\" rating. But I am giving the hotel the benefit of the doubt: this is a new hotel and technical glitches such as this one should be expected. BUT HOPEFULLY THIS IS THE LAST TIME! So if you plan to stay there and TV and Phone is important to you, please confirm that this has been resolved!!! We were compensated for the above problems with a discount in our stay, and also food credits, so the staff was at least willing to acknowledge the inconvenience. My biggest concern is without a phone, it is not that easy to contact the front desk in the event of an emergency. So it goes beyond mere \"inconvenience\". The room: VERY NICE - We got a room on in the 40+th floor facing the Bellagio fountain. It was a studio with two bathrooms, Full Kitchen (microwave, oven, fridge, stove...), large master bedroom, separate living area, terrace that is accessible via the living room or bedroom. Restaurant: We ate at the wicked spoon three times - VERY GOOD food and service, just be aware that you should get there early as the line could be long at times (1-2 hour wait, especially on weekends). Note that there could be TWO lines. One for purchasing the meal, then another line to get into the restaurant. Some folks discreetly waited in line at the cashier and another waited in line to be seated to save time (up to you to decide if this is worth the hassle). Regarding the above TV/Phone issues. I commend the staff for quickly offering several credits (food and beverage, etc) to make ammends. It was not yet fixed at checkout time. Aside from this gigantic fiasco, I must say that the hotel is run fairly well. But questions on what happened with the video and phone systems are still unanswered. I think that with a fully functioning TV and phone system, our stay would have been AWESOME. Instead, I felt disappointed. Tips: Same with previous posts - get a room with a terrace view on the Bellagio side, higher floors. I got a good deal with the conference rates, so I dont know if price will be an issue with non-discounted rates. Try the Wicked Spoon restaurant, great buffet and service I would rate their service as Good only because of the phon/tv issues, which were pretty serious issues. Airport transportation until 8:30 pm, costs about $7 i believe. Shows around the strip: At the very least, call the venue for pricing. The Bellagio actually gave 20% off discounted tickets, so ask about those. There is also a ticket discounting place across the street from the Bellagio and also closer to MGM Grand, these are good places to stop and check out most shows in the area for the day or next day.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, AB", "Title": "\u201cIt's hip and happening at the Cosmopolitan!\u201d", "Author": "estherbunny", "ReviewID": "UR121153907", "Content": "OVERALL We stayed at the Cosmopolitan as part of a group of friends celebrating our 30th birthdays.

It is very apparent that is geared towards a younger and flashier clientele (you won\u2019t find a lot of older senior citizens or families with young children here). The d\u00e9cor in the lobby was impressive. I loved the columns made with LCD screens with the changing display backgrounds. Check-in was a breeze. We checked in at midnight so the lines were not very long. We were very lucky that we were able to get an upgrade. We got a room facing the west (so we had a view of the Bellagio fountains and the Paris resort). It was a honeymoon suite with a fluffy comfortable double bed with a walk-out balcony, complete with a hot tub and joint shower that had a large window of the same view and a separate room for the toilet. There was also a large living room area with a sofa and a desk with a flat screen TV above it as well as a wet bar (with a sink, dishwasher and mini fridge). (There was another flat screen TV in the bedroom as well.) It truly was a beautiful room that exceeded all my expectations. ROOMS The TVs and phones had a really cool technology where you could control the lights, climate, set the alarm, etc. We didn\u2019t use the TVs and phones for this purpose so I cannot really comment here. I did want to point out that the touch screen on our phone didn\u2019t work for most of our trip, even despite rebooting it several times. Also, our TV in the living room was also on the fritz and was stuck on one channel only. This was not a major problem to us though. I read some reviews of people complaining about the lack of maintenance in the rooms and I have to mention that I did notice this. In my friend\u2019s room (he had an apartment style room with two bedrooms and 2.5 baths along with a living room), it was very apparent that the previous guests had a party in the living room. There were missing paintings and on the one painting that was there, you could see that someone spilled something on it. Plus, there were scuff marks and dings all along the walls in various places. FOOD & ENTERTAINMENT INSIDE COSMO We ate brunch at Wicked Spoon twice and it was fabulous! Highly recommended and great value for your money. There is plenty of food to choose from to please everyone\u2019s palates! They also offer complimentary mimosas so we took advantage of that. We also ate at the secret pizza place on the 3rd floor (Ask concierge where it is to find it. It has no name so I wouldn\u2019t even be able to tell you. Lol.) as well as Holsteins, which is a burger joint. Both those places were alright. Nothing special but not bad either. The pizza place could be a bit of a wait as there are only two guys doing everything (taking orders, making pizza and collecting money). There is also limited seating there so you may have to wait for a seat or take your pizza elsewhere. If you get a hotel room facing the west, you will be able to hear the music from Marquee (the club inside Cosmo). This was generally not a problem for us as we were not back in our rooms until well past the club closing (around 3am). However, on Monday night, we were in our rooms at 1am and you could hear the beat of the music, even with the balcony door closed. I do not find this to be a negative because it is something that I was well aware of before going (thanks to the TripAdvisor reviews!) and it\u2019s nothing the hotel can necessarily help (c\u2019mon, it\u2019s VEGAS. And Marquee is THE hottest nightclub in Vegas at the moment) Speaking of Marquee, we went there Saturday night. Being hotel guests, you can get in with no cover as long as you show your hotel key card. You can also bring in another guest, free of charge. I recommend going early at like 10pm so that you don\u2019t have to wait in line and then getting a re-entry stamp and coming back later (when there is more people). When we first got in at 10pm, we checked out the entire club before it got busy. It\u2019s a really neat club with three floors each with a different theme/d\u00e9cor. They were playing top 40 songs around that time. Then when we came back around midnight, the place was PACKED. You seriously could not move on the dance floor. The music also became house music with a live DJ (Marquee is known for house music). I did have fun that night but it was very difficult to dance because it was just that crowded. Plus, it got really hot in there after a while. You can also go out onto the pool/patio area but then it got really cold (despite the propane heat lamps). A word of warning about Marquee: When you first go in, they take you up to the club in an elevator. But when you leave (or have to re-enter), you have to take the stairs. You also have to take the stairs going between the different floors in the club. It\u2019s a bit of a trek when you\u2019re in high heels and drunk, so be prepared. My biggest complaint about this hotel is the lack of free wifi. Many of the other major hotels on the Strip offer free wifi so I don\u2019t see why Cosmo wouldn\u2019t, especially given that their target market are individuals in an age group where they constantly use smartphones to communicate. The lack of free wifi is a major deciding factor in whether I would stay here again. I found it very restrictive not having free wifi and it was extremely frustrating for my group of friends to communicate with each other once we got back to our hotel. We couldn\u2019t even look up restaurants and other information to help plan our trip. CHECK OUT Check-out was also a breeze. It was noon and the lines were long and the hotel was busy. But the hotel had extra staff on hand to direct you to the next available agent as soon as they were free and some of the staff were also walking around with iPads to help you check out quickly. You could also check out using the TV screens in your room but we did not utilize this feature. There was also staff handing out free bottles of water to those waiting in line. What great service! We also utilized the bell desk to store our luggage until our flight later that night and the service was prompt and courteous.

The room was enormous and had separate sleeping area w/door from the living/dining room. We entertained friends our first night in the living room w/kitchen and were able to make our own drinks in room- such a convenience and $$ savings!! I ended up coming down with the flu and spent the next 2 days in bed with a high fever- that said- it was a nice room to be sick in! Very comfortable bed, lots of space, 2 large bathrooms- yes- 2!!! I slept while hubby played, and it was as close to home as I could imagine while traveling. That said, there were a few things to note as negatives. The kitchen was beautiful with stove/oven, microwave, refrigerator and dishwasher- that said, there wasn't ANY dishes!! None! No silverware, no plates, no pots/pans, etc! What's the purpose of a full kitchen with TONS of cupboard space and no dishes? That was annoying. It did have 2 wine glasses and 2 martini glasses and a full mixed drink shaker/tool set, but that's it! Also, the hotel didn't have washclothes. Weird thing to be negative, but I thought it was weird that they only had bath towels and large handtowels- I was looking for washclothes because of my fever. Finally, because I was in bed sick, we never had the room cleaned because I didn't want to be disturbed. So we called to get more towels, and they never came. Finally, I mentioned the amazing view of the fountains from our balcony, but one major negative I thought was that the balcony glass was filthy! So if you were sitting down on the comfy patio chairs and trying to watch the fountains- you couldn't see it because of the dirty glass, so you had to stand up and look over the balcony railing to watch. Just think they could get a window washer up there, but again, minor point. The interior of the casino/hotel is beautiful and VERY busy! I found it to be the most packed of the casinos we visited.

All in all, I give this hotel high marks, with just a few annoyances. The good: * Terrific Location - center of the strip, next to Bellagio, easy access anywhere on the strip * The Room - I had a Terrace Studio with Fountain View. This is a really nice hotel room. It was spacious, with a lovely deck overlooking the Bellagio fountain, very comfortable bed, nice furniture, a great whirlpool tub and large separate shower. I don't know that the fountain view is really worth the extra $$, but it was fun to watch it at night before I went out and after I returned late at night. * The Gym - is large, clean and very well-equipped. One of the best hotel gyms that I have visited. Kind of fun to see the boxing ring at one end of the gym, though no one was sparring while I was there. * Coffee Shop - Va Bene, on the 2nd floor. Good coffee, espresso drinks, croissants, and a very tasty italian breakfast sandwich with prosciutto, egg, and arugula. * The Service - friendly, helpful * Check-out - The line looked long (see check-in below), but they had extra staff walking around with I-pads and checking people out very quickly, so it took me less than five minutes. The Less Good (and somewhat annoying): * The Gym - yes, I know I said it was good, and it was. But you are required to pay $15/visit. Personally, when I am staying at a nice hotel, paying $400/nt for a room, and they have a gym on-property, I find it to be annoying to have to pay extra to use the gym. This kind of nickel-and-diming drives me crazy. Just charge me $15 more per night for the room, please, and don't make me pay extra for everything! * Wi-fi: ditto! It's 2011, for crying out loud. Just include it. * Check-in - I arrived adjust before noon on a Friday. Waited 25 minutes on line to check in. It was a busy weekend, I understand, but 25 minutes is a bit long to make someone wait. I give them credit, though - about 15 minutes in, with long lines, they sent someone around to give out water bottles. Good touch. * The pools were closed, which is understandable in early November. But, why not leave the hot tubs open? With days in the low 60s and nights in the 50s, the weather was perfect for a hot tub, but alas, no go. Everything was shut down. The casino was fine - not as nice as Bellagio or the Wynn, but certainly nice enough. We enjoyed a great drink at the chandelier bar one night. Some kind of whisky with frothed maple syrup concoction on top - very interesting and tasty. The Cosmo is a solid hotel. Rooms are a very good value at around $400/nt for our stay.

Check in was the worst that I have seen in over 18 years of regular weekly travel. There were long check in lines moving very slowly. Bell Captains worked the lines telling guests to be to be prepared for multiple hour long waits because rooms were not ready. Ticket scalpers worked the line as well. One women was lying of the floor - visibly exhausted by the wait - but no one helped her. Apparently one of the bellboys informed me that waits of this kind were common. I wish I had read tripadvisor reviews more carefully before I booked -- I have been in many Vegas hotels - none displays less concern for hotel guests than this hotel. But this was not enough. We booked a studio suite with a small kitchenette and terrace. While the room comes with a microwave and dishwasher - it has no dishes or cutlery. When I called to ask for cups and a spoon - the concierge connected me to housekeeping, which suggested that we pay a $50 fee for spoons and cups. When I asked to speak to a duty manager - I was put in touch with Ricco - a VIP Supervisor (whatever that means). Rico claimed he did not know what a duty manager was - and asked me if I had any experience with other hotels in Vegas (which I had and repeated to him). Ricco confirmed that while I had a dishwasher - If I wanted dishes - then I would be charged a $50 fee for a \"kitchen in a box\" and a $200 deposit to boot. He told me that he would take care of my problem, by informing the concierge of the proper answer to my earlier question about the lack of cups -- so in this way future guests would not be inconvenienced like I was. Thanks Ricco -- that was really a great answer. Ricco finally agreed to send me two cups and two spoons --free of charge. It did not make me feel much better. What kind of idiots does this hotel think we guests are? If you advertise a hotel room with a kitchen and dishwasher - it seems pretty basic to offer a few dishes and some rudimentary cutlery. Charging $50 to rent cutlery for one night seems pretty steep and unreasonable. Sort of makes me feel like this hotel is making fun of its guests and that we are being treated like we are very stupid. Vegas is a great city with lots of unique sites and experiences. The Suites at the Cosmopolitan are fine and I had lots of waiting time in the lobby to check out the innovate decor. BUT there are lots of other suites in Las Vegas where the hotel management works hard to make guests feel welcome and ensures that all guests are treated in a dignified manner.

I asked for a room close to the elevator, we got one 3 rooms away from the other end of the hall. Great. Thanks. Upon entry, it was apparent the housekeeper took a break before they finished cleaning. dirty bathroom, pubic hair on the toilet seat, only one bed was fully made, no tissues etc etc. I called down to the front desk within 10 min of getting to the room (from my cell phone no less, because the phone in the room was broken), got the \"Oh we are so sorry.. we'll move you to a clean room right away\". So, shortly after, someone from the bell desk came up and helped us move our stuff. Only, they didn't bring a new key for us.

She said oh just go to the bell desk and they can help you so you dont have to wait. So.. we went to the little overpriced pizza restuarant for a quick snack after a long drive, then back to the bell desk to get our keys. We stated what happened and they looked at us like we were crazy.. as they can't make room keys up. Great.. go stand in line again.. so this time, since it was a little later, we got stuck in line (the Marriott member line which was supposed to be \"faster\") for about 45 min. The couple ahead of us was clearly having some issues with them as well, arguing with the desk clerk. Finally we got to the desk, fuming. We get our new key and a $100 food and beverage credit for our troubles. We go alllll the way up to our room. We put the key in the door.. doesnt open. we put the key in the door again.. doesn't open.. and again.. and again.. the key doesn't work!! So after a few dozen 4 letter words came out, we called the hotel from our cell phones in the hall and said send someone up here now.. we are not walking all the way downstairs again to get another key that doesnt work. They said they would send someone right away. We waited on the floor outside of our hotel room for almost 30 min and 2 more phonecalls later before someone finally came up to let us into our room. Still no working keys in our hands.. same line, go back downstairs AGAIN.. well, we were heading out for dinner and a show (not in a good mood!) so when we came back after the show (not like we could stay up late, as we missed nap time because of all this room drama) we went to the desk, thankfully no wait this time since it was late, got our new keys and made the guy come upstairs with us to make sure they worked. Finally.. we coud get into our rooms. And now a $150 credit. I would have prefered the many hours of my day wasted back!! The next day, our room was never serviced. We only stayed for 2 nights, so the 2nd night we decided to use our food and beverage at the Milos restaurant. Thank god the meal was essentially free minus tip. Way overpriced. Food was decent, but for 1 appetizer, a shared piece of fish and a side of veggies plus 3 drinks, the bill came to $192.77. The fish alone was over $80!!! It was just some piece of sole grilled in butter with bones in it! Ick!! The guy who checked us in even told us dont get the tomato salad and we are glad we didnt. The table next to us had it and it was about 1 tomato cut up with a little bit of onion and cucumber I think and it was $28.00. Waaay overpriced for average food. The night before we ate at MGM, craftsteak.. excellent!! Totally worth the price paid. So anyway, back to the cosmopolitan.. It has now been about 10 days since our trip and I was just reviewing my credit card statements and have been overcharged $42.77. So now I need to call the accounting department... wish me luck! The marriott should be embarassed to be associated with this hotel, and I have no idea how they think they are 5 stars. There are hardly any amenities in the rooms. Not even a coffee maker! ridiculous. I'm pretty sure even the super 8 has a coffee maker. And I am not sure what the purpose to having a door to separate the toilet from the rest of the bathroom is when the door is clear glass. Not everyone travels with a romantic partner, and even if this was a romantic trip, I really dont need to see my loved one on the throne. I realize not every place has a separate toilet area, but for heavens sake, if you are going to make it separate, at least make it functional so other people in the room can use the rest of the bathroom. I would never stay in this hotel again, they have many kinks that still need to be worked out, and I just get the overall vibe of this hotel as trying to be posh/chic, but stuck in \"below average\".", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cWhat a bad excuse for a 5 star hotel..\u201d", "Author": "BBMORR", "ReviewID": "UR121004456", "Content": "Was there in Nov for the S E M A show and it was a stay from h$##ll Room was never made up.Staff was RUDE and rooms at Holiday Inn were nicer..

And baby, it's all here at the Cosmopolitan thanks to the vision of the hotel's CEO, John Unwin, who deserves great recognition for a great concept. He has created a hotel that is the epitome of refinement, hipness, and coolness, that is equally friendly to the young and the not-so-young. Your every moment in the hotel, every turn around every corner that you take is an adventure in sight, sound, and feel. Truly, this is a hotel that feels like a museum of modern art as you walk through it; from the LCD displays in the lobby on columns with changing displays, including images of people who look 3-dimensional and really alive, who look like they're trying to break out of the LCD panel but can't get out; to the texture of the chairs at the bar just off the checkout area that just make you want to run your hands along them over and over, and are ever so comfy to sit in while you enjoy master bartenders who make the most original drinks I have ever had; to the several story high chandelier which you can sit inside of and have drinks as you watch light bounce off the crystals; to the sculptures throughout and the art work even in the hotel rooms that is of modern museum quality. They even have a vending machine that sells art that you can take home. How cool is that?! This is about the only hotel on the Strip with balconies, which will comfort smokers who don't like the smell of a smokey smoking room, but can have access to the open air so they can smoke. And for non-smokers, it's a great vantage point, the best in Vegas: The views from the balconies are astounding. You wake up in your seriously uber-comfortable bed to the image of the shooting water display across the way at the Bellagio. What a lovely way to wake up. My bed was so comortable, it was difficult to get myself up. The bathroom in my one-bedroom suite was SICK, as in sick in a good way, if you are familiar with the expression. It was huge and stately, it felt like the kind of bathroom you would find in the home of a millionaire. The bath products were of the highest standard, the water pressure very good, it was one of the best showers I've ever had. The bathtub was humongous, fit for a party of four. (Behave yourself now, though hotel's slogan is, in fact, \"just the right amount of bad).\" The touches around the room show a schocking amount of attention to detail, including nightstands that are lit inside, book collections of a good quality to read from, washer and dryer (so you don't have to bring so many clothes with you), and the kitchen had slick black marble counter tops and a super high quality oven. Most people who come to Vegas don't live like this at home. Here's your chance to feel like a millionaire, if you are not. The lobster roll in the restaurant on the ground floor restaurant took me back to my days on Cape Cod, so delicious. I found the restaurant on the ground floor to be the most superior in the building, and they even wrap your food so you can take as takeout back to your room, and if you want to remain in your room, which you may well want to do, the rooms are so beautifully done, in impeccable taste, not to mention so creatively planned out. There are rooms with huge Japanes soaking tubs, where you sit in this massive tub against a floor-to-ceiling window so you can gaze out at the full length of the strip as you bathe. They have one of the best hotel gyms I've come across in my travels around the world, a relaxing spa, and coolest bands ever that come here to play. I am very confused that the Cosmopolitan is not yet in the top 3 hotels in Vegas on tripadvisor.com. If you want a special experience with every comfort imaginable, in an environment that is refined and beautiful and imaginative in its layout, if you want the extroardinary, if you are extraordinary yourself and seek out the extraordinary, and you're tired of the feeling of mass-production Vegas hotels, this is the place for you. I don't usually pay recognition to the CEOs of properties, but in the hotel world, one would imagine Mr. Unwin is a rock star. You will so love this place, you might want to change careers and work here. Everyone working at the hotel is proud of this property and take pride in what they do. I asked some of the employees what it was like to get a job there, and you actually have to go on multiple auditions to be chosen. I WILL STAY AT NO OTHER PLACE IN VEGAS. THE COSMOPOLITAN IS MY LAS VEGAS HOME. If you stay anywhere else in Vegas...well...I don't know why you would.

I booked a studio terrace suite that was supposed to overlook the strip months in advance. On arrival I was checked into a standard room instead of what I booked but wasn't told that until I went up an discovered this. Room was great on 52 floor overlooking the Bellagio water show, but I wanted the studio suite with balcony that I booked and paid a premium for. When I tried to get the terrace studio I was told there were no longer any available! The reception girl tried to sluff me off but eventually I got a manager who agreed to get me into my booked suite the following day. Unfortunately when I finally checked into the suite I discovered it was not overlooking the strip but with view looking the other way from the strip. Given how long a wait it was to deal with reception previously I decided I couldn't stand to go through it again to move rooms a second time. Despite the lesser view, the suite was fantastic! Indeed one of the nicest I have stayed in. 2 large flat screens, a large living area with kitchenette, amazing king size beds with 6 pillows, massive bathroom and shower. However the stopper did not work in the hot tub so I could not use it. The bed was exceptionally comfortable. Cleanliness of the room was good for the most part except shower floor had not been cleaned and one of the robes had some knarly blood or other stains all over the front of it and yet was still hanging in the closet and had been tied with sleeves stuffed in the pockets so the maid must have seen this but didn't care enough to remove and replace it. Also had issues with the room cards which often didn't work in the elevator and in my room door. Not 5 star! Wasn't crazy about the casino as the tables were all priced quite high for minimum buy ins and the room has a somewhat cold ambiance. The main floor stage and book sports lounge was excellent for watching the NFL games on Sunday and our two servers were excellent. The food was fantastic as well. Was a little surprised that they did not give any comp drinks to anyone given that the majority of people there were wagering on the games including us. Other than the servers in the main floor sports book, I found the rest of the service in general to be less than friendly and in many instances rude and contemptuous. Many of the staff were quite young and quite cocky and full of attitude. For this reason in my view it doesn't meet the criteria for a 5 star resort. I also must note that this is the first allegedly full service hotel I have ever stayed at where I was never offered or given any assistance with my baggage. I viewed a number of bellmen congregated and chatting around their station in reception on numerous occasions but never once saw one providing any assistance to any one during my entire stay! All in all, I would not stay here again due to the often non-existent and disdainful service and attitude of much of the staff. At this price point I feel I deserve some decent service, courtesy and respect.

We had very high expectations for Las Vegas' newest hip destination, and were not disappointed. Driving up was incredible. Very cool experience with the glossy garage floor. Loved the video screens in the lobby and elevators. Room was very hip and I have no complaints about the cleanliness. We had dinner at comme \u00e7a, breakfast at Wicked Spoon and drinks at the Chandelier. Great experiences at all three with excellent food and service. Very impressed with the almost overwhelming selection of food at the Wicked Spoon buffet, and everything was delicious. No way you can miss the Chandelier Bar - this is clearly one of the coolest places on the Strip! Only problem we had was the TV and phones in the room not working. We were just there for one night so never reported it, so can't actually consider it a negative. The only reason I would have liked to use the TV is because supposedly you can use it to control lighting and other features in the room. Still, no problems turning the lights on and off, and I really liked the switch by the door where you could select either \"Hello\" or \"Goodbye\" to turn everything in the room on/off. I'm shocked to see so many other reviewers posting the same problems with the technology in the room. I wonder what's going on. We were there on a Sunday so the Marquee Nightclub was closed, so can't comment on the noise issue.

Fortunately, all other staff we encountered (housekeeping, security, front desk, restaurants, concierge) was friendly as one should expect. We had a suite in the west tower facing south and it was quiet, no noise from the nightclub (aside from the odd noise from drunken idiots in the wee hours each weekend night, such as one running down the outside hallway screaming and another screaming from her balcony). Soundproofing between rooms appears to be very good as well. Being in the west tower meant a moderately longer walk to the strip, but still seemed to be less than at other hotels. Not being forced to constantly walk through the casino to get anywhere was a welcome difference from other hotels. The room was a good size and very comfortable; the room photos on their website don't really do it justice. The bed was comfortable as well. Technology (aside from the odd glitches) was impressive. No problems with housekeeping during our stay. Public areas are very nice, hopefully they will be properly maintained. And people watching (especially on the weekend) is very entertaining. The tone of the place is light, it doesn't take itself too seriously. We got used to total strangers joking around with each other every time we got on an elevator. Location was great for where we wanted to go. As for restaurants, we tried the \"hidden\" pizza place, Milos and Wicked Spoon, and enjoyed all.

We got great food and service at the Outback on the strip (Coke bottle building). We went to the MGM Grand for entertainment. We got wow food and service at Emeril's in the MGM Grand. It reminded me of the tip-top service at the Hotel Sacher in Vienna. They were provided perfect support for no-constraints eaters and gluten-free eaters. We left a large tip, well over 20%. We got better service, better wifi conectivity, better food (wrt Cosmopolitan, not MGM) and paid less to stay in a cabin at a national park in the same month.

For example, our room keys had to be changed 3 different times during a 3 night stay (once @ 4am following a very long night in the casino), and when I politely, I thought, complained to the desk attendant upon the 3rd occasion, her response was that I should be on her side of the desk oh, the problems SHE was having!. Guess they didn't go into customer service during training. Customer service training is what I did for a living, so I am hyper-sensitive when it is lacking, and it sorely was! .On to the rooms. They truly are beautiful, and the beds are like sleeping on clouds. I love the quirky wallpaper in the bathroom, stare at it awhile and see what appears..and all the funky books, I can't imagine how they keep them in the rooms!The soaking tub was enticing, but the stopper was broken, didn't bother to have it fixed on that first trip...left the place feeling mixed, wanted to love it, did love parts of it, but the poor service and lack of attention to detail..it was like going out with a super hot guy and finding out he's lacking character.and personality. On to the second stay.we were upgraded to a jr suite. Even cooler room than the first, fantasy bathroom! Service vastly improved. Staff was very polite, room service prompt, and when they screwed up my breakfast order, it was corrected almost before I hung up the phone. So service is much better. On to cleanliness of room. Upon arrival, it was perfect, however, during our stay, on two of our 4 days, housekeeping left it looking as though my teenage daughter had \"cleaned\" it..not good. Now, back to the soaking tub.. This time, determined to use it. Again, stopper broken. Called for maintenance. The worker arrived promptly, was polite, said the stoppers are a big problem, fixed it, and left. Went to fill the tub...he got in the tub in his dirty shoes and left greasy shoe prints for me to clean before my soak.I cleaned it up, filled it with bubbles, got in with my iPad, and enjoyed my hard earned soak.. when I drained the tub, there was a big ole bug who had been my tub-mate. I guess he floated up out of the drain some how, probably because the stoppers are usually broken, the tubs don't get much use, I am theorizing. In any case, this type of thing is .NOT what I am looking for in a hotel of this caliber. One other gripe that I have is with regard to the casino. I stopped an attendant (one of the guys in a suit with an earpiece, don't know what his position was). I had a simple gaming question, and he was very, very snotty. Also, I found beverage service in the casino to be quite slow. I definitely prefer most other casinos in equivalent hotels. The ventilation, however, rocks. State of the art, no choking on smoke. So I don't know.. both of these trips were business for my husband, monkey business for me. If we were on our own dime, I don't think I'd choose this hotel.

There is definitely a cleanliness issue...Scuff marks on doors and walls, vents in toilet were filled with dust, water spots on inside the bath area/glass doors, stains on duvet, wallpaper peeling, waste basket not empty upon arrival. 2.

We were wanting breakfast at approx 7am each morning and room service was the best bet. For 2 drinks, cereal for 1, breakfast sandwich & French toast cost 75 dollars a day. So breakfast alone that week cost us over 500 dollars! (7 dollars for a glass of juice) -noise from the nightclub, not to sound the party pooper but come 8pm most night we were falling into bed (8hr time difference, just finished us) well by 10pm to 4am the club was on & it literally felt like I was in the same room as it was so loud. I think the club is on floor 15, the highest floor is 75... I was on floor 68, we at to listen to this for 5 out of our 7 night stay I think. I actually asked upon check out are all parts of the hotel subjected to the noise level and was told i would of been better of in the west tower (if I'm right) so why after requesting quiet room we were put there, I don't know. - another 1 on cleanliness upon check in there was a cigarette end outside in the hall way by our room door, it was still there when we left. Overall we liked the hotel, ate in 2 of the restaurants, 1 that done sushi (weren't very keen on that) & the Henry bar which was very nice. To have to pay 15 dollars a day to use Internet is a joke after spending so much booking the place. The swimming pools were all closed as it was out of season, I had a look around and they looked nice. Seem abit small for the size of the hotel so can imagine them to get very busy in the summer. I wouldn't return but that's because I seen so many other beautiful hotels while we were there so I'd prefer to try another 1. The hotel needs to look at ways to improve house keeping & maybe then complaints would fall. This is definetly the place to stay if you want to party. As another quest said the casino is small compared to others in the big hotels on the strip.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Ontario", "Title": "\u201cDisappointment with the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for girls' getaway\u201d", "Author": "Moreau-Verlaan", "ReviewID": "UR120792024", "Content": "I stayed at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas with my sister and friend, so we're three women in our early thirties, who are also moms, wives and full time workers, getting away from it all for some fun. We chose the Cosmopolitan as it was described as the hip, young, fun place to stay in Vegas and it is centrally located on the strip. After my stay, I would agree that this description is true. However, given the hotel's price point and the fact that it is brand new, our expectations were higher than what was delivered. The hotel decor and ammenities are very modern; while the majority of the guests staying at the hotel were also young. In the room itself, everything (i.e lights, temperature, guest account, etc.) can be accessed through the TV or phone, which are all connected to a server / computer for controls. The technology is really great, however the hotel was experiencing computer problems. The WiFi was not working for three days of our five-day stay. A scheduled conference call one morning was unable to go through because the phone system in the tower we were staying in was out of order. The iHome clock radio iPod docking station provided in the room wouldn`t turn on. Also, we experienced issues with the slot machines at the hotel casino, with which we were so frustrated that we ended up not using the hotel casino and went next door to the Bellagio instead. Check-in was easy and we were given three room keys, since we were three people registered to the room. As expected, the room was equipped with a kitchennette, including a sink, microwave and mini-bar, but did not include any cutlery or dinnerware. Also, there wasn't enough glassware to accommodate three of us staying in the room. We requested additional glasses and were told that we would be charged $1 per cup plus a $5 service fee. The minibar was unlocked and our intention was to store our own drinks and snacks inside, however, we were informed not to do so (minibar consumption is automatically charged by weight, and storing additional items inside would potentially result in a charge). A separate mini refrigerator was delivered to our room instead and the mini-bar was locked. Another disappointment was the lack of a coffee maker in our room and our request for a coffee maker was denied. The layout of the room worked really good for us. Firstly, the huge patio doors and windows overlooking the Bellagio fountains and Vegas strip were really great! The view was awesome. A sitting area, with a desk and chair included, had plenty of space (and luggage racks) for each us to have a spot to layout our suitcases. The shower, vanity, and toilet arrangment in the room were conveniently layed out. The space is generous; there is plenty of room for three ladies to get ready for a night on the town in Vegas. Another disappointment, however was that housekeeping consistently only supplied towels and washcloths for two people. On one occassion, the freshly supplied towels had make-up on them, which lead us to question how fresh the towels were... Also, we found that housekeeping was not actually supplying freshly cleaned glassware, but rather were just rinsing out dirty cups left in the room. During our stay, we had hoped to use the pool / hottub area. The weather was quite cool in Vegas during our stay and at check-in we were told that the pool area was closing down for the season. However, we had the opportunity to visit the Golden Nugget pool area one evening, which was open and being used. The hot tub was running and a nice warm fire was lit with comfortable seating around it. There were tiki torches, candles and a serviced bar. Especially after seeing how great the Golden Nugget pool area was, we were dissappointed that the Cosmopolitan pool area could not be used. Overall, our trip was fun, but the hotel accommodations and service could have been better. We were expecting more for what was paid and will likely not return to this hotel again.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cAwesome new hotel!

We frequently travel to Vegas and have stayed in many hotels and this definitely offers something new and unique. Upon arrival the hotel looked beautiful and check in was very fast. We didnt wait more than a few moments. We headed to the elevators to check out our room. It was the fastest elevator I have ever been in. There was NEVER a wait. We arrived in our room and were very excited because it was a nice NEW trendy room with lots of neat touches. We stayed in a terrace suite in the east side tower. The room had an amzing view, seperate living and bed room, 2 full bathrooms, full modern kitchen and washer and dryer. I could live there!! And ladies, the bathtub was to die for. It was so nice. It had tiny little jets or bubbles or something that was just incredible going on. And even better than that, was the lighting!!!! It was the best lighting to do make up that I have ever the pleasure of using. As for the overall lobby and decor of the hotel it was very unique, trendy and sexy. The hotel itself wasnt as large as I had thought it would be. Maybe because I am used to the Palazzo and Venetian type places. But it was still plenty large. The casino was nice a little on the small side but easy to get around and fun atmosphere. My only disappointments with the whole place were choice of restaurants and shopping. There were only a couple of very high end shops that were not my taste in the hotel. But this really wasnt a big deal because right across the street is Planet Hollywood and in my opinion they have the best shopping. And right next door is Cesars Forum shops. Now on to the restaurants...biggest complaint was that I never saw a quick grab ang go type place... sandwiches or breakfast place. I could be wrong but I just didnt see it and I ate just about everywhere in the hotel. STK was just ok. The food was fine. You can definitely dress up and go here before a night out. We love lively places and fun atmospheres and this was just ok. The dj was so loud that we couldnt hear eachother. Im all for the loud music but I wouldnt go back for that reason alone. If I cant hear the person sitting next to me yelling, then the music is too loud for a dining experience. Blue Ribbon was pretty good. Small, fairly good service and probably the best dinner meal I had there...Which isnt saying much. Although, I would recommend it. We also ate at a place called China Poblano on two seperate occassions. One for a snack in between meals and once for lunch. Both times were good. It was fairly inexpensive and still felt light and healthly. We enjoyed the individual tacos. They come ala carte for around 4$ each and you can eat one in a matter of 3 bites. But it was a unique concept and I would return for a quick meal. We wanted to get a massage but never made it over to the spa so unfortunately I can't review it. Overall, the Cosmo was a hit for our group and we will be returning next time. It has beautiful rooms, great location and fun atmosphere all they need now are some restaurants.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cWhat a view!\u201d", "Author": "KentuckyCookie", "ReviewID": "UR120782393", "Content": "We did pay more than we usually do to stay here and we paid an extra $50 per night for an upgrade.

Check-in experience: good. Decor: modern w/ warm textures. Cool lighting on the pillars in lobby. Floor had food on it from previous guests. Shower amenities were missing and the lip balm they provide which is a nice touch, was already used (gross) so I tossed it. Toothpaste was missing from the dental kit. TV with all the hotel info threw me at first as I kept looking for the hotel book but once I figured out it was all in the TV, it was cool to go through. The blinds throughout the room need instructions on how to put down. Room had great view of Vegas. On Day 2 of my stay my Fiji bottle of water wasn't replaced so I called to ask for it and they never showed up with it. Room service breakfast - food both days came lukewarm which means the walk from the kitchen to my room must be a really long one... In the morning, I showered and grabbed my bathrobe to put on. Walked around getting ready, and then, I put my hand in my pocket, and I found a USED MAXI-PAD. After the initial shock, I threw it down onto the floor and threw off the robe. I called to complain, received an apology and I asked for a new robe, the missing toothpaste and a new lip balm. They forgot the toothpaste so had to go get more and come back. Checkout experience was super easy and the bellman was extra helpful which was great. So if you do decide to stay at this hotel: 1. Don't wear your robe. 2. Don't expect fast or complete service. 3. Don't expect a clean room with all your amenities. 4. Don't expect hot room service food.

First, the housekeeping was very poor. When I arrived there was an open Gel on the counter, no washclothes, no tissues and a lipstick laced handtowel. Once I figured out how to use the phone I called and they sent someone up to tidy the bathroom and bring in all new towels. The next day, housekeeping showed up at 3pm or later and again left no washclothes or bathmat. There is no separation between checking out and checking in. When I tried to check out at 11am I was on a long line behind a group which was attempting to check in. No receipt had been left under the door or I would have bypassed the front desk. You are forced to go to the front desk if you want a receipt. Management needs to address this issue. A person looking to exit quickly and catch a flight should have to wait on line with 10 people ahead of them checking in. The room has no coffee pot or clock; two things that I look forward to in any room and if you keep the closet door open the person in the bathroom can't exit that room except through the shower; in other words the layout is poor. On a positive note, the workers aside from housekeeping are very accomodating and want to please you, the restaurants are very good having eaten in 3 of them on sight and you are near everything. While I am glad I experienced the hotel, I would not return until I see more favorable reviews to suggest that they are serious about overcoming some of their shortcomings.

It has got to be one of the most beautiful interiors inside a hotel I have ever seen. So much detail and time has gone into the decor and the furniture. I loved walking around taking it all in. The reception area was amazing esp the pillars that appeared to have naked people inside them trying to get out!. This pillars I could of watched for hrs. This was lucky as you do tend to stand in line to check in for a long time. I waited 40mins at 9pm at night. some would say this is the norm for vegas but a hotel of their style and quality I would of hoped this wasnt the case. Unfortunately it didnt get better. When we finally got to check in we were told that there were no clean rooms available!. After being up nearly 20hrs and a 11hr flight this wasnt something we wanted to hear. The receptionist was abit manic but nice enough and did appear embarrassed he was telling us we couldnt have a room. We were offered $100 and to go eat in the restaurants but after our journey it wasnt an option and we just wanted to get to our rooms and shower and not sit in a classy restaurant smelling of airplane feeling like crap. We ended up sitting in the bar nearest to restaurant waiting for a phone call which we were told would be in a hrs time. Unfortunately at 11pm we were still waiting for this call. Once we had sorted out an error with the bar bill ( btw not enough staff on bar) we went to reception to find our room finally ready. No reason was given as to why we did not receive a call. Whilst waiting for our bags we spoke to our guests to find out we were lucky and they had been waiting 3-4hrs for rooms. To me this is just unexceptable!!!!!!. When we did get to our room we were chuffed to bits. they are amazing. The beautiful decor and furniture continued there!. Def best room ive stayed in. The next morning due to jet lag we woke early and checked the tv menu for breakfast times as these were not mentioned on our arrival. We checked the tv and it stated Wicked Spoon opened at 700am. We went down to the restaurant to find it was open at 0800am. We then went back just before 0800 to join another q for breakfast. This time there were two q's one for regular guests and one for vips etc. This was fine but the annoying thing was that when the cashiers finally arrived ( never seen so many grumpy looking girls taking money in vegas before in one place) and starting calling over guests, they completely ignored the regular customer and just processed the vips!. Everyone in my q wasnt best pleased and questioned whether the hotel management valued all its guests or just the ones with big wallets!!!!!!!. Fair enough to take them through first but do all the cashiers need to do that or could one carry on with us no bodies?????????. This happened everyday and everyday the people in my q were no happy!. Once we were finally allowed in with the rich people(btw you q twice to get into breakfast - only in vegas!!!) the breakfast was fantastic! the biggest buffet ive seen. Grill chef in the mornings taking care of your eggs need to smile and shouldnt really talk about not getting enough tips in front of guests! One other important thing! INTERNET IS BAD! the worst ive come across in a hotel!!!!! drops out all the time.expensive at $15 a day. I am disappointed I have had to be abit negative in the review but a hotel so spectacular really needs to look at the service it provides to ALL guests and not rely on how the hotel looks. In my view customer service is first and foremost, IF your looking for an amazing hotel The cosmo is the one but looking for one that cares about ALL its guests there are plenty better!.

My first trip was with 5 of my closest best friends for my 21st birthday and we stayed at the Flamingo (I think that says enough). The 2nd time was earlier this year with my boyfriend and we stayed at the Mirage. This time I stayed at the Cosmo because it was where a conference I was attending took place. The hotel is very pretty - love the decor - from the chandelier bar to the hot pink splashes everywhere, it is a sexy hotel! Even though I was in town for a conference I was able to enjoy sin city for the weekend. Room: Besides the dance club vibrations till 4am, the rooms are large and pretty. The bed and bedding were great, very soft and embracing. The products in the bathroom are C.O. Bigelow \u2013 love that. The lotion is the best \u2013 I need to go buy it one of these days, I still dream about it. The balconies are great too, not so clean \u2013 but whatever I guess. Who doesn\u2019t love a balcony, I\u2019ll take a little dirt on the windows for a balcony. My room was located in the south tower that over looked the Marquee pool area. The pool was closed for the season during the day but definitely open during the evening\u2026 I know it is Las Vegas and it is probably a given that you should be out at the clubs instead of sleeping but that is just not my style anymore. I like to go to a nice dinner with my boyfriend, have a cocktail and hit the hay before midnight. I am a grandma going on 27. Regardless, Marquee Nightclub is the hot spot to be in Vegas and it was definitely popping till 4am. So, if you\u2019re looking to get some zzz\u2019s during your stay, I\u2019d recommend asking for a room that doesn\u2019t face Marquee. Another thing to note is the room service is pretty poor. Their cleaning and making of the bed seemed very careless and quick. My opinion might stem from a high standard of service I normally get at the Trump when I travel to NY where they fold your clothes and adjust everything in the room to the t. Here is seemed like they came in replaced products, took the towels, made the bed and that is all. Which is fine I guess, but the added touches are what turns me to a great time. Room Service (food): I ordered room service one morning and it was just what I wanted. It arrived on time and did the job at filling my belly. It was way over priced but hey \u2013 what room service is not over priced? Restaurants: Blue Ribbon Sushi \u2013 I love a good sushi meal. I\u2019ve been to the Blue Ribbon in NY and wasn\u2019t that impressed. The one in the Cosmo did the same thing for me. Eh. I mean, it is really expensive and the sushi is just so so. We sat at the sushi bar so it was fun to watch them put the rolls together but other than that, not impressed. Save your money and skip this one. Estiatorio Milos \u2013 GO HERE! We ended having lunch on Sunday here as a last stop before we hit the airport. Loved it! The lunch menu is a bargain and the food was very good. Would definitely go back here next time. Please try. There is a little patio you can sit outside on too that is lovely. The Henry \u2013 Stopped here for breakfast one day, pretty good. Nothing too fancy, I think this is the restaurant they use for room service so it was similar to the breakfast I had in my room. It is pretty good, it is what it is. Nothing to call home about. Shows: Must go! \u2013 \u201cO\u201d Last time we were in Vegas we saw the Beatles Love Show \u2013 it was my first show I\u2019d seen and I was blown away. This time we saw \u201cO\u201d at the Bellagio and it was out of this world. My boyfriend loves to gamble so he used his casino credits to get the tickets for free, I think they run roughly $170 a pop but I would pay every penny for a ticket it was that good. If there is one thing to see, please go see \u201cO\u201d! You\u2019ll be amazed at how in shape the performers are, the logistics of moving the floor up and down and the tricks they pull on the audience. Simply stunning. Hats off to those performers. Michael Mina: After \u201cO\u201d my boyfriend and I dined at Michael Mina\u2019s restaurant in the Bellagio and it was just a good or maybe even better than the show. If you have the money and enjoy fine food, you have to go here. The service was white glove and the food was mouth watering. Check this place out. Helicopter Tour of Grand Canyon: In one form or the other I need to see the Grand Canyon before I die. Why not from a helicopter? It is a pretty penny (I think $300 a person) but it is a once in a lifetime experience.

I'd read some previous reviews on the service, cleanliness, and check in process at the hotel and i have to say I was satisfied with all, for the most part. There always seemed to be some clutter in the common area by the elevator, but it looked like people had simply missed the trash can that was conveniently located by the elevator doors and just left their napkins and cups on the floor rather than picking them up. We checked in on Sunday for a trade show I was covering on the property. The bell staff unloaded our luggage and all my boxes for the show and couldn't have been more eager to help. In fact, he pulled a few things out that didn't even need to go. We got in line to check in and were immediately offered an ice cold bottle of water which was a nice touch. We waited 5 minutes or so, at the most. The staff pulled up my reservation right away and offered us a few upgrade options at an additional expense. I had reserved a 1 bedroom and didn't really care about a strip view or the Bellagio fountains so we passed on the upgrade, got our keys and went upstairs. The agent took our claim ticket for our bags the bell staff had taken and they arrived about 5 minutes after we did. The bell man very helpful. He unloaded our bags and my trade show gear neatly stacking the extra boxes and tubes in an out of the way corner. He told us about all the high tech features of the room, showed us the balcony, pointed out some of the other properties, and got us a bucket of ice. He even cautioned us about the automatic mini bar. He explained that lifting an item from the 'fridge or counter top would result in an immediate charge, we appreciated the warning. The room was a nice size and well appointed with two 42\" flat panel tv's. I don't know why, but the rooms featured a dishwasher. No soap, and no dishes aside from the glassware in the room. The rooms are really high-tech, almost too over the top. You can control the whole room from either the tv or the phone system, fun at first, then it just got a little tedious. There were really just a few negatives. The only phone was next to the bed, there was no phone in the main living area on the desk. I was traveling with some other folks from my company and sometimes it's just easier to use the house phone versus my cell. There was also no in room coffee. I need that jolt in the morning and I either had to run down to the coffee place in the lobby or order a pot of coffee for $8 from room service. There was no casual sit down restaurant \"coffee shop\" style that you normally find in Las Vegas hotels. I had room service once which was good, and ordered a sandwich to go from Holsteins, which was their most casual restaurant. Both were pretty good experiences, but were a bit on the pricey side.Vegas is just far more expensive than it used to be. Our group went to the Marquee night club on Monday night. We had a great time. Good music, fun crowd, and good drinks, although a bit on the spendy side. however, as guests of the hotel we got free admission to the club and priority line service, which was very cool as there was a line even on a Monday night.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Elmhurst, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Property.

The hotel is beautiful and is striving to be a five-star hotel. It isn't there yet. The hotel has been open, I was told by an employee, 9 months. When I made my reservation, I had requested a room located away from the elevators. The room I was assigned backed up against three elevators, which caused some noise which I handled by wearing ear plugs to bed. My room wasn't cleaned one day, and it took a phone call and a trip to the desk to get housekeeping to clean it. The telephone in my room did not work, which was problematic because the alarm clock is tied into the phone and TV. If the electronic features in the rooms actually worked, it would be great. Trying to use the TV to check the weather or set the alarm merely resulted in the screen freezing. In order to report my phone not working, I had to go down to the front desk because there was no house phone near the elevators on floor 17. Typically there were lines at the front desk. I did make my complaints known to a desk clerk and later, because the problems with the phone weren't resolved, to a customer service rep, and I was given a $50 food and beverage credit along with $50 off my room rate for one night. Staff told me they had been having problems with housekeeping and the electronics. I was told the entire phone system went down a day or two before I arrived. Until the hotel gets its act together, I cannot recommend this hotel. The rooms are suites equipped with a microwave, a small refrigerator, and a jacuzzi bathtub plus a separate shower. There was no coffee maker in the room, however, which makes no sense. The hotel is huge and includes a large number of restaurants and shops. I enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Comme Ca, an excellent French restaurant in the hotel. Based upon my experience, I would likely not return to The Cosmopolitan.

This resort is awesome and like none other. If I were visiting this property and not staying here, I could easily give them an A+, but poor hotel service and a few other issues are seriously lacking. If you judge your hotels/casinos/resort properties on the design and decoration, give this place 5 out of 5. It's incredible and beautiful everywhere you look. The casino, bars and common areas are stunning. However, if you come to a high-end hotel and were expecting even average hotel service, plan to be disappointed. We stay in hotels frequently and even the 2 and 3 star establishments have better and more consistent housekeeping. We had a 2 bathroom suite. Some days we had a complete set of towels in one, some days both, and believe it or not, at least one day zero. On top of that, there was one day where we were gone all day, had the \"please clean\" sign on the door knob, and returned at 8pm to find the room as we left it. On the plus side, the terrace and view were excellent. The room was comfortable. The restaurants are great. Most of the staff is excellent. The pizza is the best outside of New England, without question. On the minus side, access to coffee was bad. We were in the west tower and our room had no coffee pot. We had a full kitchen including dishwasher but no way to make coffee. The nearest coffee is all the way in the east tower; very big negative for us coffee drinkers. My most important comment is about housekeeping. I know mistakes happen, but this place could not get it right. In the year they've been open they should have been able to work these bugs out. The housekeeping was inconsistent and not acceptable. I'm normally not that fussy - give me clean towels, empty the trash, wipe the table tops, and vacuum the floor and I'm happy.

We booked a terrace studio and were upgraded to fountain view terrace studio at check in at no addtl charge. We checked in around 5 pm Saturday and waited about 20 mins - no biggie. We loved the large balcony in our room, which had 1 small couch on it. It would be nice if they had higher furniture on the balcony, because the glass has a design that obscures the view of the strip when you are sitting. Still, I highly recommend the fountain view if you can get it, even if you have to pay a little more, as it is very cool to have such a great view of the strip and the Bellagio fountain right from your room. Our friends were staying at the 4 seasons and they were impressed with our view, the Chandelier bar, and the way you have to use your room key to access the elevators. We were on the 27th floor and could still hear the thumping from the Marquee nightclub , but it didn\u2019t keep us awake. The kitchen is weird as others noted. A dishwasher but no dishes or silver wear and no coffeemaker? We were on a budget so we brought our own tea bags and some cheap mugs we could leave behind, and just used the microwave for hot water. The mini bar is pricey and we didn\u2019t use it \u2013 we were charged for something but they removed it from our bill with no issue. All the hotel pools were closed for the season which is a bummer because the Boulevard pool looks really cool. We did use the SAHRA spa on our last day ($28 for a day pass) and it was really nice. If you buy the day pass for the spa you also get use of the gym, so that\u2019s good. A day pass for the gym only is like $16. We didn't have a car so booked a shuttle to/from the airport thru the hotel - it was $7 per person each way and really easy. The casino/lobby in the hotel is great- it feels pretty chic and modern compared to some of the others we went into. We didn\u2019t make it to the Marquee nightclub in the hotel but saw the line to get in on Saturday and it looks like it would be a blast. I think you have to pay extra to get into it, too - It is definitely a hot spot. Also the hotel has so many restaurants and shops - we felt a little overwhelmed at first but got the hang of it by the 2nd day. Didn\u2019t eat on property. The staff was very nice and helpful, our room was immaculate and serviced daily, and the location of the hotel (center strip, next to the Bellagio) is fantastic. Our room had slippers and robes which was nice. We called \u201cbeck and call\u201d twice and it took forever for them to bring what we requested. As others mentioned, the CVS is short walk if you need to pick up anything. Our room was about $250 per night (Saturday was REALLY expensive) but it was worth it for that view from our terrace. On a side note, we saw O at the Bellagio and it was the most amazing show I\u2019ve ever seen.

When I arrived, they first tried just to tell me they had no king beds available and would tow queen beds do. I said okay, but I followed up with asking whether I was getting my reserved room category. He looked and finally admitted that I was not and that none was available for the entire weekend. I asked what they were going to do about me not getting the reserved and paid-for room category. He went in back and spoke with a resert manager and returned offering a $100 food and beverage credit. He said that was the best he could do. As it was late, I said fine and decided I would address it further the next day. I spoke with someone else the next morning, and she said that shw would immediately add $50 to my food and beverage credit. She noted that the earlier agent had only made a notation in my record and did not actually apply any credit to my account. She made the change and also said that the resort manager was busy but she would call me later to respond to my issue about the unavailable room category. She did call me and said that they would send me an email offering a couple of free nights on the next stay or an upgrade on a paid stay. I waited 10 days and did not receive any communciation so I filed a comment on the Marriott website. They referred it to the hotel and I finally did receive an email with the promised stated offer. I replied back that their response did not make me feel any better about the hotel and did not give me any confidence that I could book and even pay for a room in advance of a specific type and they would deliver. They said that not getting a room type was typical of how Las Vegas resorts work, to which I responded that I had not had that problem at any other of the several that I have used. A guest services upervisor responded to my follow-up that they could not do anything further. My issue is that, for a property purporting to represent the top end of Marriott, I expected a better response when they could not fulfill my reservation specifications that were booked in advance and paid for in full. They did not acknowledge up front that the room category was not available. They did not reimburse me for the rate differential. And, they did not make me feel that any reservation made for a specifc room category could be fulfilled.

I stayed three nights in a room with two queen beds while attending a conference at the hotel. My room was large with good ceiling height, beautifully appointed and very clean except for the outside windows. The bathroom is quite spacious. One enters in the vanity area with two sinks. A toilet compartment is off to one side with a less than full height swinging opaque door through which motion can be observed. On the other side of the vanity area is a very large shower compartment (no tub) that is adjacent to the bedroom. It's great if you are a person of size. However, there is a large clear window between the shower and the bedroom with a pull-down shade operated from the bedroom side. I'll leave this to the imagination - for your delight - or abject horror. It could get interesting if you have inquisitive or mischievous children of a certain age. Technology reigns at the Cosmo being a new hotel. A computer pad in the telephone controls most everything. I didn't see a clock in the room. I called housekeeping to see if there was supposed to be a clock in the room as I didn't want to be accused of stealing one. I was told there was no clock. However, I did find a clock on one of the computer pad pages. One night I tried to program for a 4:45 AM wake-up call but was unable to complete the process. I phoned \"Beck and Call,\" the Cosmo's version of an operator to request the 4:45 AM wake-up. I arose on my own at 4:15 AM. The 4:45 AM call never came. I called \"Beck and Call\" at 5:00 AM to complain. I was told they called but that I failed to answer. Not true. I thought the system might be on mute, however, I received a call from home about 5:30 AM. The phone rang loud and clear. BRING YOUR OWN ALARM CLOCK. There was one bathroom light I couldn't figure out to turn on and a bedroom floor lamp I couldn't turn off except to pull the plug. I don't know if these lights were defective or I was technologically challenged. Here's advice if you want a quiet room. I stayed in Room 46 on my floor in the West Wing. I don't know if the floor plan is the same on every floor in this wing. I was at the west end of a very long corridor. According to the schematic on back of the door, the only room further west is a suite that occupies the width of the wing. Also, the room is next to a stairwell which is great in case of emergency. CLOSELY MONITOR YOUR BILL. When I checked in, the attendant warned that if I lifted a bottle in the mini bar I would be charged even if I didn't consume the product. Forewarned, I never once opened the mini-bar door. Nor did I consume any snack from the tray above the mini-bar. When checking out, I had two mini-bar charges on the bill which were removed upon my protest. Interestingly, I overhead a person adjacent to me also complaining about an improper mini-bar charge. I don't know how this property is connected with Marriott, but you can earn Marriott Rewards points at the Cosmopolitan. The hotel has about 14 front desk positions. However, on my numerous trips past this area, it was rare that I didn't observe a line. The hotel has about a dozen eating facilities I ate six meals at the Cosmo, two at Holsteins and four at The Henry. Pricing is on the high side that is typical of hotels. I didn't eat at the buffet. There was always a waiting line from my several observations. There are several dining options at the Miracle Mile shops across from the hotel on Las Vegas Blvd. If you cross, do so just north of the hotel. Be advised that if you walk south on the east side of Las Vegas Blvd, you will go block after block after block before you get the chance to cross the street to the west side. In closing, here's a \"slice of life\" tidbit. In the snack tray of ingestibles, there was one non-edible item, a $45 pair of binoculars. I didn't see any birds in Las Vegas. The sales promo for the binoculars touts its use to view The Strip, the mountains and the pool area. What was outside my room were two large buildings of human occupancy. Couldn't be a great quality pair of binoculars based on the pricing for the edibles. But that's not why I didn't buy them.

We had booked a wraparound terrace suite for 4 nights. Our deal was for the non-premium view, but the old $20 trick at check in got us a premium view upgrade for an extra $25 a night - considering it was a weekend, we were pretty pleased. We also got free breakfast at the Wicked Spoon during our stay. Our suite was gorgeous, spacious and well laid out. Yes, there's no crockery or cooking materials/plates in the kitchen, which makes it kinda redundant unless you bring your own, but other than that - there were no problems with the room, and the cleaning standards were perfectly good. We had an incredible view of the Bellagio. Only a shame they don't provide ashtrays on the terrace - we had to borrow one from the Chandelier bar. The only other negatives were very small - a few stains on the sofa that obviously weren't going to budge, no ability to easily play an iPod through the rooms (other than that - the technology was fine and painless to use). Yes, it was noisy on the balcony at night, but as soon as the doors were shut, problem solved. It's vegas and I really expected it to be a lot worse from some of the reviews I've read.

Wicked Spoon was great, the Chandelier bar also great, with the exception of one waiter who gave my husband something of a bad attitude when he went to collect some drinks for us to have in our room. The bamboo pool being closed in the week meant the main pool was too full to use, but otherwise - service, quality and standards exceeded our expectations.

I must stay after reading the reviews on this hotel I was very worried about staying there, but its such a beautiful property I needed to see for myself. I am so glad that I did! The hotel its self is very stylish, trendy & classy. Everything is in its place and very well thought out. Pros: The check-in process was VERY smooth. I booked the terrace studio and they offered me a room with a view upgrade for $25/night (which is good considering its normally $80/night) - I took the upgrade and then found out it was unavailable. Because of this, I ended up with a Terrance One Bedroom with view for the same price!! Winning! The room was gorgeous! It's very spacious and perfect for entertaining! Large sitting area with couch (pullout), TV, a nice bar area with; sink, microwave, dishwasher (but no dishes) & fridge (that couldn't open) which was a blessing as I didn't want to be tempted to drink anything. I filled the sink with ice and used that as my cooler ;) The bathroom alone is reason enough to book this room! Its huge! The shower and soaking tub are enclosed in a separate glass room that has windows showing the bedroom and the strip! The bedroom is quiet big and the bed is super comfortable! Big screen Tv as well. The terrance is a great addition to the room! The view of the Bellagio fountain and strip was amazing!! I recommend taking photos at dusk! Cons: The room didn't have a docking station for music, a bit of a fail considering this is pretty standard these days. No coffee maker. The internet, phones & tv's were down for the whole duration of my stay, which made keeping in touch with the rest of my party pretty difficult, but after I complained they comped me my $75 upgrade fee, which made me happy! I always try and stay somewhere new when Im in Vegas but it will be hard not to stay here the next time Im in town!", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGrand Sparkly Magical Place!\u201d", "Author": "Tatianahairexts", "ReviewID": "UR120547523", "Content": "It was my second time in LV.

Room was phenomenal - and I'm a seasoned traveller. I walked into the room and stopped dead in my tracks in the doorway with my jaw dropped. Some have commented on the strange wallpaper in the rooms - I loved it - very on-trend with the hotel vibe. Only caution - expect long lines, and long waits, upon check-in. Maybe try to check in during non-peak hours might help. I'm sure everyone arrives between 9:00 - noon for their arrival, and the wait was mind-numbing. Even when you do arrive, don't expect your room to be ready before 2-3:00 pm. If you arrive at those peak hours, do yourself a favor - stow your bags with the bellman and enjoy the strip, you're in a great location.

I had stayed at this property back in June in the one-bedroom suite. During both stays, the housekeeping was very, very poor. I stayed in the east tower, which has 30 rooms on each floor. Some days housekeeping did not get to my suite until late afternoon. After the service, it was obvious that the only thing they did was replace the towels and make the bed. Dirty glasses remained on the counter and were not replaced, bathroom sinks were not wiped down, and not once did a vacuum touch the carpet in the suite. I found trash on a chair and floor from the previous guest or from a guest months ago given the level of cleaning. I did mention these issues with a staff member, but apparently he just ignored it or the person(s) he reported them to ignored them. When I stayed in June, the internet was free. During my recent stay, they changed that policy and began to charge $15 for 24 hours of internet. They didn't advise me that in the middle of my stay that this policy would change. The minibar attendant came in and moved everything around, which caused me to be charged for all of those items. I also had a $150 room credit and noticed that items charged to the room were not being removed for the credit. Needless to say, I spent 25 minutes on the phone trying to get all of this straightened out. Not only are the rooms lacking in cleaning, but the casino as well. Someone sitting next to me dropped a large cigar ash on the floor (accidentally) and I noticed that ash still on the carpet in the casino for the rest of my stay.

There is a lot of choice all at standard buffet quality. Unfortunately that's probably all there is to the positives. Now to the negatives and in order of how much it bothered us... The hotel has one of the hottest clubs in Vegas called Marquee located on the 17th or 20th floor, and it is loud! Most nights the top outdoor floor of the club is closed but on Friday and Saturday nights when it is open the music is so loud that we could hear it on the 50th floor. We can also hear people screaming. And this goes on until the early hours of the morning (closes at 4 or 5 am). You can complain all you want to the hotel but there is nothing they can do about it. Best we got was $100 off our stay. There is a full kitchen set up but no plates, cutlery or coffee/tea making facilities in sight. You can ask for them to be sent up, but be prepared to pay $1 per piece you ask for and on top of that a delivery fee, and of course a tip on top. Room services comes with a hefty 18% service fee, plus a delivery fee (think it was around $5 for soup and salad), And yeah, you still have to tip the guy when he comes. Internet access comes at a cost of $15 per day. That's the most expensive I've ever seen. Room was cleaned daily but not all dirty glasses were replaces and rubbish wasn't emptied everyday, On the last day we actually lost all our bathroom mats!

Right next to Bellagio and in the middle of everything. I will admit check-in was a bit long but the check-in staff do an excellent job of informing you about the hotel, so I can see the reason for the wait at check-in. Our room was 6597, overlooking the Bellagio fountain, perfect view and the room is awesome from the bed to the large bathroom with an incredible shower. Piece of advice, unless you absolutely need something from the minibar, don't open it. If you open it and something moves, the sensor pad is sensitive and bills you...leave it alone! The hotel has a great vibe about it and ranks up there with any other hotel. The restautants...Holsteins on the 2nd floor is awesome, the best burgers and shakes. $8 for a shake but worth it. Their chicken burger is also amazing, if you go around lunch hour expect a wait, so plan ahead. On the main floor as you come into the hotel, or exit, it there is the \"Henry\", great restaurant for breakfast. Their shaken freshly sqeezed OJ is good, only thing is the electronic sign outside the restaurant says $5 a glass but on the bill it is $6 a glass, this needs correcting. Their buffett at the Wicked Spoon on Sat and Sunday is awesome, well worth it, when you get there pay first and then line up. Based on these 3 restaurants I can only surmise the other hotel restaurants are great as well. We loved this hotel, everything is well done, staff were great, we had a great time and it is centrally located, we will be staying here again on our next visit, without question.

A call downstairs gave us the standard \"we're all booked\" front-line response so we had to get a supervisor who, surprise!, found another room on the 56th floor. I will say, it was a beautiful room. On the surface. Upon further investigation, there were two dresses in the closet left by the previous guests that apparently went unseen by housekeeping. Also the trash in the kitchenette had also been left untouched. There was one robe, instead of two in the closet. The beautiful Sub-Z fridge had a broken piece that rattled about. If these seem like ticky-tack complaints, I think I can be ticky-tack when spending $650/night. Oh, and the telephone/TV/internet system was completely kaput for the last two days of our stay.

Hope they get it together. P.S. If the management read these reviews, both of the check-in staff I interacted with were excellent at dealing with difficult situations - particularly a german woman - sorry can't remember her name.

The girl said we would like the view, but I didn\u2019t ask what it was as I was hoping for a nice surprise as we hadn\u2019t booked a Premium View. The West Tower is handy for the lobby and buffet, the East Tower is handy for the pool. Entered the room and there was a huge bathroom to the left. Twin sinks, a large Jacuzzi bath tub, a huge shower and toilet in a separate room. Above the bath there is a window without glass so you can look out into the room and onto the balcony. There is a blind for privacy. There was a hairdryer and bathroom scales. Toiletries were by Bigelow Apothecaries and were 60 ml sizes of shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, mouthwash and body lotion. There was also a disposable toothbrush, soap, shower cap, lip balm and a shoe shine. The lounge area had a corner suite which would seat 5-6 people, coffee table, 3 lamps, a large desk with coloured pencils(!) and a 47\u201d flat screen TV. The kitchenette had a well stocked mini bar with freezer below, a dishwasher, sink, coffee maker, microwave, snacks, 2 ice buckets, 2 wine glasses and 2 hi ball glasses. A coffee and tea pack was available at $5. In the bedroom area there was a king size bed which was extremely comfortable and 6 pillows, 42\u201d flat screen TV, small desk under the TV. The double hanging wardrobe housed the ironing board and there were 2 robes and a space where there should have been slippers. The single wardrobe was shelved and housed the safe and iron. There was a laundry bag and a bag for putting shoes in for complimentary shoe cleaning. The balcony door was 3 doors wide and there was a love seat with padded cushions, a dark wicker table and an ashtray as smoking it permitted on the balcony, but not in the room. We had been upgraded to a Premium View room which had a great view of the Palms, Bellagio and fountains, Caesars Palace, Trump, Treasure Island, Venetian, Harrah\u2019s, Imperial Palace, Flamingo, Hilton, Bally\u2019s and Paris with the balloon and Eiffel Tower. I called Housekeeping and was put through to Beck and Call. I asked if there should be slippers and they said there should be and they would send some up. I also reported a blown bulb in one of the lamps. Both the slippers and blown bulb replaced promptly. I still couldn\u2019t get the phone to connect to the wifi in the room, but the netbook connected. There was also cable internet which had a better signal. Everything was brand new and shiny as the hotel only opened on 15 December 2010. Most hotels have offered reduced rates soon after opening. However the opposite is the case with the Cosmopolitan. The rates on their website have increased and there have been no offers. The room was 620 sq ft with a 110 sq ft terrace. Went to the Wicked Spoon for dinner. It wasn\u2019t busy at all. Our server gave us bottled water before he took the drinks order. Had soup, prime rib, lamb, truffled potatoes, green beans, roasted Brussels sprouts and a selection of desserts. It was all very good, especially the prime rib. Had coffee and cheese afterwards. Hubby fixed the bath plug as it was letting the water out. I had reported it about 4pm and was told there was a 30 min backlog, but no-one came. I also reported that I couldn\u2019t pick up the wifi in the room on my phone and a technician was supposed to come, but didn\u2019t turn up. Couldn\u2019t connect to the internet with the netbook, either wired or wireless. Rebooted then got a screen asking me to accept T&C\u2019s, but when I clicked Submit, nothing happened. Rebooted again and eventually got on after about an hour. Didn\u2019t need to open a browser and accept T&C\u2019s when I was using it at the pool. I believe there is now a $15 per day charge for the wifi which I would be loathe to pay if it wasn't reliable.

Being the new, hot place, this made the Cosmo probably more noisy than I'd expect, or like, for business. There are plenty of bars and music around, lots of restaurants, and excellent service. However, it's definitely designed for parties. We decided to take a little tour around Las Vegas on Halloween to see what the scene was like, and found it was rather quiet compared to other times I've been there around this time. When we got back to the Cosmo, we found out why -- everyone was there. The place was packed. When I went up to my room, which had a great view of the pool from the 25th floor, I found out that the Halloween event at the Marquis club extended out into the day club area, which was outside, by the pool. That means I was treated to the club music until 4 am. No sliding glass door could block that sound. Looking outside, I decided it was futile to call the desk to complain about 500+ people at a party downstairs. Other than that, however, the rooms were great. No noise coming from outside, in the hall, or anyplace else (except for that night). The appointments were as good as any in the city. Huge bathroom with first class toiletries, nice king bed, sitting area (I had a king terrace room) and a decent view, considering all of the high rise buildings at the City Center, etc. I had a hard time figuring out all of the room controls (including the thermostat?) on the TV. There were plenty of food options. Make sure you check out the secret pizza place on 3. It's not really secret. There just is no sign, only an unmarked door down a hallway. Just look for people outside eating pizza. The grill by the pool was closed for the season, which was too bad. It meant no food by the pool. The service was top notch all the way.

I looked at the room options and decided to pay a bit more and get a king one bedroom terrace. I specifically booked a king bed because I did not want two queens since I would like to sleep comfortably in the same bed as my husband, who is well over 6 feet. And I decided book a one bedroom so it would feel more spacious. I prepaid for the entire stay. We arrived at about 9 pm -- tired but excited to start our anniversary celebration. I was horrified when the front desk informed me that they did not have ANY rooms with a king bed and there had to give us two queen beds (not a one bedroom, no terrace). I couldn't believe my ears. I told them that I had specifically booked a king one bedroom terrace --- months ago --- and that we were celebrating our first year anniversary. He stated that there was nothing he could do tonight to accommodate that but they would TRY to find us a king bed for tomorrow. He then offered a couple of free cocktails. I was dumbfounded. I asked if there was anyone else I could speak to. He finally offered to ask the manager to come over. She came over and again said they oversold the room that we had booked and paid for and did not have ANY rooms with a king bed left. She said they were sometimes forced to downgrade their clients when this happened. Then she offered $50 in room credit. She made it seem like she was doing me a huge favour in offering me anything... even though the price difference between the room I was being forced to accept and the room I already paid for was at least $50. She then again said that they would TRY to find a king bed for us tomorrow. Outraged but extremely tired, we spent the night squished into one of the queen beds. We were moved to the room we had booked and already paid for the next day but the celebration obviously started off on a very bad note. I had booked and prepaid the room through expedia and asked whether that had any bearing on being downgraded. Essentially, I asked whether there was a specific way that I should have booked so as to guarantee that I would NOT be downgraded. The reply was that it didn't matter how I booked --- they could downgrade any reservation. One week later, I can barely talk about the incident without reliving the outrage. I am sad to have the memories of my first anniversary celebration marred by the outrageous business practice of this hotel. Any sort of service at the hotel was extremely slow. The room that I had chosen was nice. The location of the hotel is also fairly convenient. But I will never go back nor would I ever recommend this hotel to anyone.

We were not sure if we would have been happy with a fountain view room either - the music from it is quite loud and so is the water being thrown in the air. The fountain goes every 15 minutes from 8pm to midnight - which might not be an issue if you don't go to bed until after midnight. The hotel is beautiful and so was our room. The TV controlling everything in the room was very nice. We also enjoyed our terrace - probably the best part. The cleaning staff was excellent - even picking up our dirty clothes to clean better. Over all it was a very nice stay for our honeymoon. If we were to go again we might stay at the Cosmo but for how much time we spent in our room, a cheap room would have done the trick.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "B.C.", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel with some bugs to work out\u201d", "Author": "Lefty48", "ReviewID": "UR120133625", "Content": "Stopped in at the Chandelier Lounge for a drink.

I must admit some of the other reviews about check in were right on\u2026 We arrived at 2pm and our room was not ready. So we had a drink at the Vesper Bar, left our bags at the desk and took a 7-minute walk to the (24-hour) CVS to pick up some essentials (paper cups, snacks, alcohol etc) for our room. They even sell liquor! there so it made shopping even more convenient. We walked back to hotel; room was ready even though we never received a phone call saying so. We got to the room and the keys did not work. My boyfriend had to go back down to get new keys, which was annoying but not the end of the world. Hotel The hotel is in a great location. Eclectic, modern d\u00e9cor and is right in the middle of all the action. Bathrooms, bars, elevators, hallways were clean. We got to check out one of three pools because the other two were closed. The fourth floor pool is small but very nice and clean. Had a lounge area with nice comfy couches, flat screen TVs, and a pool table. Bars are really neat (especially the Chandelier). The casino and sports book are a little small, not a plus if you\u2019re a big gambler. Noise from the clubs did not affect us at all. Service Despite the small hiccups upon check in, everything else went smoothly. Staff was super accommodating and friendly including at check-in, concierge services, bartenders and housekeeping. Even the store clerks were extremely helpful. The general store on the first floor was sold out of ginger ale, so the man called other shops on the second floor and found us ginger ale! We tipped housekeeping a few dollars each day and they replenished our bathroom toiletries daily. They even gave us extra slippers and robes to bring home, shh! \u263a Rooms My boyfriend mentioned at check-in that we were there celebrating my 30th birthday, so we were upgraded (for FREE) to a premium view room over looking the Bellagio fountains. We didn\u2019t want to leave the room! Rooms are modern and clean. D\u00e9cor is urban and cool. Everything worked (TV\u2019s, lights, remotes, etc) so that was a plus. And thanks to the reviews I read before going, I knew there would be no silverware, etc.. (hence the walk to CVS) Buying bottles for the room also saved us some cash at the bars and there was no need to open the overpriced mini bar. The view was the best part\u2026. WHAT A SIGHT! I would stay here again just for the view\u2026 It was a breath-taking sight, just perfect. You must see for yourself! The bed was probably the most comfortable bed (in a hotel) that we have ever slept in. It was like sleeping in a cloud. My boyfriend is going to buy the comforter and pillows he loved it so much. :) Overall, it was a great stay at the Cosmopolitan.

This was my second time staying here. I love the cool decor and the great feel for this upscale hotel. It has the feel of a boutique hotel, but has all the amenities of a large hotel without all the walking. Check-in was cool with the built-in Ipads and hi-tech art. The rooms are very spacious and beautiful. Decorated in deep blues, black and cool hues, and sporting large flat screen TVs and hi-tech lighting. We had a balcony with a small sofa, which felt decadent in Vegas where balconies are scarce. There were three pools for sunbathing. The Marquee pool was 'adults only' and part of a private club pool that you have to pay a fee to be included. We checked it out, but decided we weren't going to pay a fee to buy drinks and gamble. The Boulevard pool was lovely, cool, relaxing, has great service, and it overlooks Vegas. The casino was hopping, but the table minimum bids were high at $25, as expected at most nice hotels. I was truly impressed with the restaurants in this hotel. We managed to eat at several. It seem they brought some of the top, cool, restaurants/chefs to impress the guests. China Pablano and Jaleo were Chef Jose Andreas addition with flavorful Mexican/Chinese mix and Tapas respectively. Also, STK was fun, cool, with great music and food. Blue Ribbon was great sushi and great/friendly service. The Slice serves great pizza if you can find this hidden 'word of mouth' gem. The Henry was a great breakfast spot. Try the short rib benedict. Va Bene was a quick coffee and pastry place. All got our thumbs up! The Hotel bars were very nice. The Chandelier Bar is a rich and luxuriously decorated lounge bar, but I preferred the Vesper which was done in a James Bond theme, white, cool flare and served old style mixed cocktails. Book and Stage was great for tequila shots on the run! For the most part, I was truly impressed with this hotel, but we did have a snafu with check-in. We were quite frustrated that our room wasn't ready at the 3pm check-in time. We were called to notify us our room was ready at 6pm!!! THREE HOURS LATE!

I had seen the commercials and was concerned that this place would be too pretentious for me. Make no mistake - this is a VERY hi-end hotel and casino. One of the newest on the strip. But FAR from pretentious, the place was amazingly comfortable (except for the odd length-wise layout of the common areas, making for extremely long walks between my west tower room and the casino/restaurant areas). Where to start; how about the room. Having stayed at hundreds of luxury hotels around the world, I can honestly state that my king STANDARD room was easily one of the 5 best rooms in my 30+ years of business travel. Rather than list off items that you would expect, I have to go with what you least expect. A FULL balcony with sofa and table for outdoor entertaining or relaxing (if hearing sirens and AC fan noise is relaxing). But my view included the nearby Fountain at the Bellagio, so that was nice. Just a great place to hoist that last drink and have a cigar at the end of a long day. The workout facility was also top notch. Smallish when considering some of the other full service hotels and spas, but very well laid out with the best equipment and a very clean decor. The other thing that struck me was the range of restaurants. Again, I thought I was going to be overwhelmed with pretentious (and expensive) choices. Nothing could be further. Yes, you can go spend a bundle on a steak (a VERY GOOD steak), but there was an outstanding burger place and an amazing Mexican/Chinese mashup - all within shouting distance. I watched most of the Divisional Rounds of MLB at the burger joint (Holsteins) and enjoyed breakfast at the ChiMex place. Both outstanding and exactly what I needed. And there are a number of restaurants that fill the space in-between; from country French to cozy Italian to CA cuisine. All of it was very good and amazingly well prepared. Gaming and bars - all top notch but nothing you would not expect, so no need to review. I made my standard contributions to the casino.... All in all, a wonderful experience at the Cosmo.

PROS Generally, this hotel is beautiful and we had a wonderful time gambling. The dealers were nice, the bars were fun, and the pool was just right. The layout of the pool is a bit odd, but once you get used to it, it's actually pretty nice. The age range was anywhere from 25-40, which was perfect for us. Although there were a few bachelor/bachelorette parties, they were fairly low key. It definitely (thankfully) lacked the 21 frat boy mentality or the 200 screaming kids. The burger place was awesome. Might have gained 10 lbs at dinner Chandelier Bar was really beautiful The rooms were quite spacious and having spent many times in Las vegas, the balcony was a REALLY nice touch. CONS: We spent over 1000 for a 5 minute ceremony in what was described as the \"wedding suite\" Translation...a larger room with a curtain blocking the kitchen area (NOT IMPRESSED) When we checked in and told them it was our wedding, they didn't even blink, offer us an upgrade, or even a free glass of champagne. We actually had to ask for an upgrade and they wanted to charge us the same rate as everyone else. Now, I can imagine that there are many weddings in Las Vegas, but probably not as many on a Tuesday in the middle of August. My husband is also a Marriott Rewards member which we thought might help with the upgrade. No such luck. The 2 tier cake with crystal banding I ordered (and sent specific pictures of) came with only one tier and looked very little like what I ordered. I was told that they had music available for the ceremony, and they showed up with two CD's and a 1980's boom box which was placed on the couch as I walked in (TACKY) The breakfast place was not with any of the other restaurants and took us 15 minutes to find. We never so much as good a free drink, cup of coffee, or anything on our wedding day despite staying there and having our ceremony here as well.

The location is ideal: directly on the strip across the street from Planet Hollywood and in between Bellagio and Aria. The hotel rooms are in one of two towers: the east tower (closest to the strip) and the west tower (set just off the strip behind the east tower). Rooms in the east tower may have slightly better views; however, the west tower still has great views and seems to have quieter rooms overall. We stayed in the west tower with a corner terrace room with spectacular views over the Bellagio fountains and the strip. Our room on the 34th floor was perfectly quiet. The only sound we ever heard was the humming of the air-conditioning units below (which did not bother us at all). The room was huge with two bathrooms, two closets, separate sitting area with flat panel TV & kitchenette plus a bedroom space with another TV. The terrace was enormous. It would be a nice touch if the hotel were to add a bit more outdoor furniture as we spent a lot of time out there watching the fountain shows and the small couch/chair is not great for more than one person. Our bathroom was wonderfully spacious. The deep soaking tub for two was awesome and had a window facing out over Lake Bellagio. Now I have to admit, I am not a huge gambler. I love Vegas for the overall energy, restaurants, shopping, shows, weather, and great hotels. I do gamble a small amount; however, it is not my number one priority. If you are like me, then this is the hotel for you. Compared to other Vegas hotels, when you enter by the main reception area you actually don\u2019t even see the casino. It feels much more like an upscale city hotel than a Vegas casino hotel. Especially when staying in the west tower; you can check in (which was quick & efficient), grab a cocktail (Vesper Bar) and get up to your room without even seeing the casino floor. No mazes of slot machines and tables to get lost in! If you do stay in the east tower, you have to walk through the casino; however, it is not at all confusing. The casino floor itself seems to be smaller than a lot of other hotels with a surprisingly high number of 1 cent slot machines (which seemed to be there more as a novelty although I did win!). The bars are spectacular. The Chandelier really is one of the coolest and most unique bars I have ever been to anywhere in the world. There is a great selection of restaurants. The Wicked Spoon buffet exceeded our expectations and was better than the Bellagio buffet next door. We also loved the dim sum and tacos at China Poblano; the breakfast panini\u2019s at Va Bene; NYC style pizza at the hidden pizza joint (in between Jaleo & Blue Ribbon); appetizers at Holstein\u2019s. The Overlook Grill by the 4th floor pool as well as Jaleo had slightly disappointing food quality and service for the price. As for some of the resort features of the property, we were not aware that you had to pay each day if you wanted to use the fitness center. I believe it was $12 or $14 per day/per person. I would have appreciated the reception staff at check in to be more straightforward with this extra cost. It would have also been nice if at check in, it was explained that the pools were not all open. We were disappointed that the 14th floor pool (west tower) was already closed for the season. We did not expect this as it was just late October and was nearly 88 degrees each day. This 14th pool looked really awesome. The 4th floor pool was open and was packed every day. Especially on the weekends, you really do have to get there when the pool opens as people follow the annoying large all-inclusive resort mentality by having one person arrive at 8am and throw down towels across several chairs for people that don\u2019t arrive until 1pm or 2pm. I wish the pool staff would provide towels and chairs ONLY as you actually arrive to the pool area and are ready to hang out. With all this in mind, we did arrive early and got great spots each day we choose to go to the pool. We also experienced fantastic poolside bar service. Overall there may be a few improvements the Cosmopolitan could make as a new resort on the Vegas strip; however, it is truly a unique and beautiful property. We will most definitely return and are recommending the Cosmopolitan to everyone.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "York", "Title": "\u201cAll that Glitters is not Gold\u201d", "Author": "Parissandals", "ReviewID": "UR119963074", "Content": "Stayed at the Cosmo for 11 nights at start of October 2011. We had read the pros and cons for the hotel on Tripadviser prior to travel and this prompted us to make direct contact in advance. We did not want to fly for close on 11 hours and to have any issues on arrival. Our concerns were around noise and housekeeping - we received various assurances that all would be in order ( I will say at this stage that the Cosmo was true to its word and actioned our requests so well done and thank you). ARRIVAL AT AIRPORT Flight on Virgin was uneventful and landed on time. Our package included car hire for the length of our stay but here is a tip ( learnt from a previous trip to Vegas )......do you really need your car on the first day when all you want to do is get to the hotel and chill out ? Do you really want to have to hang around with the crowds for the shuttle bus to take you to the car rental depot and then possibly waste more time waiting in line and getting hot etc ? We certainly didn't and so we had arranged to collect our car the next day !! Instead we jumped straight into a cheap taxi and at the hotel within 20 minutes of collecting our luggage. With the trip back first thing next day we spent about $ 30 in total on taxis but reckon we saved at least a couple of hours messing around. ARRIVAL / CHECK IN AT COSMO The reception area at the Cosmo is truly opulent and gives a great first impression. Loads of check in desks and all staff were smiling. We have read other comments re check in and the wait times etc but it must be luck of the draw. We were attended to within no more than 5 minutes and enjoyed soaking in the ' vibe ' that seems to come with the hotel. The emails we had sent were stored on the system - we had asked for a high floor in the West Tower to escape the noise that had affected previous guests. We also wanted a nice view of the Bellagio fountains ( we had stayed at the Bellagio the year before for 14 nights ). We were allocated a 1 bedroom suite on the 36th floor, right in the middle of the West Tower. So, all good so far and off we went. The lifts were excellent though this was to be expected since they are practically brand new. OUR ROOM Quite simply the room was one of the best we have ever stayed in !! The new feeling was still evident and all of the fixtures etc were in excellent condition. We had 2 oversized bathrooms and 2 massive showers, double sinks in both. The kitchen area, whilst ultra-modern with a separate dining area, was somewhat sparse in terms of utensils etc, a point mentioned in other reviews. I can see how some people would not like this but we quite relaxed, only because we were not intending using the kitchen. Some drink making facilities would have been nice but I understand that they were provided initially but guests stole the expensive coffee makers ?? There was also a lovely lounge area with a door onto an oversized balcony. Large TV and office desk area as well. Really impressive. The separate bedroom was also first class, again with its own private access to the balcony where there was also 2 large comfy chairs. The view of the Strip and the fountains ( god knows how many photos I took of them ! ) There was also a cupboard with a washing machine and tumble dryer - a really nice feature and were able to get everything washed and sorted before we came home !! The bathrooms were luxuriously appointed, main bathroom also had a jacuzzi. In summary, a true 5 star room. A haven away from the mad world of the Las Vegas Strip that was only 5 minutes away!!! HOUSEKEEPING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Very hit and miss - in fact when a ' miss ' I would say more like a nightmare ! As mentioned, this had been a concern before we travelled and I had told the Cosmo this. As such I would have thought they would have kept an eye on things. When we first arrived we needed extra hangers for clothes ( don't forget we were here for 11 nights ). We called down and asked for 3 more - some half an hour later about 15 hangars had been placed in the hallway !! We left out the surplus ones in the kitchen area hoping the maid would take them away the next morning, we even left a note saying we didn't need them !! NO - they were not touched for the next 2 days !! We ended up just leaving them on the floor outside the housekeeping room on our floor. Each morning when we left the room we would call down to housekeeping and let them know we were going out for the day \u2013 this worked well as each time we always came back to a \u2018 made up \u2018 room. The quality of housekeeping was POOR however \u2013 looked like a quick wipe round the bathrooms, sink areas still showing soap marks and toiletries not replenished. When we also wanted bedding changed and placed the required card on the bed, we came back to the same sheets !! What\u2019s the point of offering a change of bedding if the request is then ignored !! In summary, housekeeping in my view is the biggest let down in the Cosmo. I wish the attention to detail each day was the same as when we first checked in. Not what is expected of a 5 start resort and disappointed that our emails in advance seemed to have no bearing. On the one day we forgot to call down to housekeeping to say we were going out ( it was 8.00am and we intended being out ALL day ) guess what\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026dirty and unmade room !!! Got back at 6.00pm to shower and change \u2013 only dirty towels. We COMPLAINED big time. To be fair the front desk gave us a $ 100 room credit as a result. So, housekeeping lets the place down, if you are not happy complain in person to the front desk LOUDLY. RESTAURANTS Must say the Wicked Spoon Buffet was first class !! We had seen on the Cosmo website a couple of weeks before travelling an \u2018 offer \u2018 for international guests. It basically was giving a FREE daily buffet for 2 with each booking. Now we had made our booking through Virgin almost a year earlier and so nothing ventured nothing gained, I emailed the hotel and asked if we could be allocated the offer. In honesty I was not expecting too much but received a very nice email back \u2013 YES !! A free breakfast or brunch for the duration of our stay \u2013 we reckon this saved us at least $ 500 !! The quality of food at breakfast was excellent, only downside was the queues ! Even if we turned up at 8.00am when it opened you could expect to wait up to half an hour for a seat. Another tip though \u2013 on our second day the queue was particularly long and we were looking at I would guess a 45 minute wait at least. Being on holiday I personally don\u2019t like having to queue so I went down to concierge. A strategically placed $5 note in the hand of one of the staff led to a personal escort to the front of the \u2018 invited guest \u2018 queue. We were more than happy to do this on a few more occasions, it saved us lots of time and remember we were getting our meal for free anyway !! We only ate twice at the Cosmo in the evening, first and last nights at DOCG ( Italian ) and STK ( Steak ) respectively, have to say both were very good. I would endorse other comments that the restaurant area is like something out of a shopping mall, guess it\u2019s to do with the hotel \u2018 footprint \u2018 which means it tall and thin unlike the likes of Bellagio and MGM etc. It does all feel a bit crammed with not much atmosphere. POOLS There were 2 pools ( ignoring the Marquee Club \u2018 day pool \u2018 ), the Bamboo and the Boulevard. We much preferred the quieter Bamboo pool which was set out really nice and had a relaxing ambience. Unfortunately during our stay it was only open 2 days and we were turned away and directed to the Boulevard pool \u2013 told it was because it was getting late in season and they did not have lifeguard on duty ?? All we wanted to do was chill out on a lounger and catch some rays !! The Boulevard pool suffers from the \u2018 footprint\u2019 issue in that space is VERY limited. As such there are numerous raised decks where you have to try and find a spot. Again it felt very crammed in. In our experience if you do not get down to the pool early ( before 9.00am ) then you could forget it !! There is a habit of people \u2018 reserving \u2018 beds with towels and books and the staff were happy to turn a blind eye. It\u2019s not on when people do this but then don\u2019t turn up until after lunch. In summary, the pool areas were not the best we have experienced in Vegas but for us this is not as major thing \u2013 we might spend a couple of hours at the most either first or last thing, rest of the time we are out enjoying ourselves !! CASINO Not the best in our view in terms of atmosphere and indeed we spent most of our \u2018 playing \u2018 time elsewhere ( we like the Bellagio and MGM ). Of course if you play Craps like we do then a good group of people can make all the difference. The casino was long and narrow with a very busy thoroughfare in the middle, a bit sterile. Never saw it really busy at any time we were passing through. STAFF Nothing but praise for the staff we encountered, from front desk / management to concierge ( Brian Adkins, you are a true credit to your profession and turned a small negative into a huge positive \u2013 thank you ). Never actually met any of the housekeeping staff but still tipped them a couple of $ every day but as mentioned it didn\u2019t seem to have any impact !! SUMMARY We had a fantastic holiday in Vegas and we will be back !! Will we stay at the Cosmo again\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026NO !! The room was a fantastic base from which to access the strip, a real oasis away from the hustle and bustle. The Cosmo is a good addition to Vegas and will appeal to a certain market. We think there is just so much more out there and we like to try new places. The fact that we wouldn\u2019t go back reflects this and if I would happily recommend the Bellagio and the MGM Signature as better all round options. You really are spoilt for choice in Vegas.

Check in was almost immediate, and the front desk girl who helped us was a doll! We booked \"terrace studios\" without a premium view. She gave us an upgrade to the \"terrace one bedroom\" which had a slightly different configuration and that killer Japanese soaking tub in the bathroom. She also gave us a premium view of the Bellagio Fountains on the 45th floor. FYI- the 45th floor was about as high as the top of the Paris Hotel across the street! Neither room was ready yet, so we wandered off a bit. By 2:30, my room was ready, and by 3:30, my friend's room was ready. Not terribly late at all. Upon entry, my room was spotless. Look at the website for some accurate photos of this type of room. My friend's room was also clean, but the TV's did not work properly. The software that lets them control the room features, such as lighting and climate, would not function. It worked fine in my room though. (I don't understand the complaints about it being hard to work. If you can press a touchscreen it's self explanatory after 2 minutes of playing around.) Over the next 24 hours, they tried three separate times to fix it. On the last call, both the front desk and the concierge were rather ambivalent about the problem. That's when I paid a visit to the front desk manager. After some pleasant conversation, he upgraded my friend to the \"terrace suite.\" This room was about 50% larger, with two bathrooms, a double sized balcony, etc. It was outstanding. The manager asked if my own room was okay, and I told him that I had no issues and was very happy. He was apologetic and very helpful. This was someone who knew how to keep a customer happy! Excellent problem resolution! (Also, this was on Sunday, after the crowds started to leave. I doubt a room change could have happened on Saturday when they were full.) The hotel/casino itself is beautiful. I expected a non-stop parade of \"beautiful people.\" While the crowd was definitely younger (20's-30's) there was a wide cross-section of people. I had zero interest in the nightclub, which was also hosting one of the Kardashian's birthdays (yawn...why are these people famous?) The casino wasn't smokey as most are. There are lots of options to get a drink or eat. Holstein's was a great lunch spot- Lobster Mac & Cheese with Black Truffles was amazing for $18 or so. Va Bene on the 2nd floor is the source of caffeine in the morning, with below average pastries. It serves its purpose. Scarpetta is a very good Italian restaurant. Their Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli were stunning to say the least! Went through one of the pool areas one day. Filled with young, pretty, tight bodies. It's not a family pool- go to MGM for that. It was small, obviously no chairs available, etc. If you go to this hotel looking to lay out at the pool during the day, it may be an issue. Overall, I found the hotel very clean. My room was done up each day. The bed was very comfortable. The robe and slippers were a very nice touch. I loved the technology offered in the room. The shower was huge and the soaking tub overlooking the terrace was awesome! The employees were helpful in general and very nice. If I wanted to pick at things, sure there were things that could be better. The makeup mirror in the bathroom was torn off the wall and not replaced, leaving an empty bracket. Oh no! How will I get over this? There's no room in the fridge because it's a mini-bar. (Except in the suite where the fridge is huge and has plenty of room!) In other words, if you want to find things to complain about they were there. But this is true of any place. If I opened the terrace door at midnight on Saturday night, I could hear the thumping from that silly nightclub. I kept the door closed and barely heard anything. I still don't understand why a club needs to be louder than the Judas Priest show at the Hard Rock. But hey, I don't have to go there and it kept the eye-candy coming through the hotel in droves.There are pro's and con's to everything, people! After staying in a terrace room looking at the Bellagio Fountains, I can say that I'll DEFINITELY stay here again! I'm sure that some places may be more opulent and classy, but I loved this location and the ability to have an outside terrace.

The buffet was reasonably priced given that you can easily skip lunch after a few high cal plates in the morning.

However we wanted a modern, contemporary type of room and the location was perfect. Check in at approx 3 pm was busy but efficient, we were told (as expected) that our room was not ready and they would call my mobile phone when it was. After 45 mins of waiting in the VERY noisy bar and feeling exhausted after a 10+ hour flight I went back to reception. Good news: We were going to be upgraded to a terrace studio room with Japanese soaking tub and handed the room card for a 50th floor East tower, west facing room. Wow! what a room it was! Two huge televisions big wardrobe, big lounge area but only a view over the West tower and the hills beyond. Bad news: About 2300hrs the noise from the nightclub below started (I had asked for a quiet room) This noise was unbearable. At about 0100 hrs I visited reception and was initially fobbed off with \u2018its not usually like this and tomorrow the club is not open, come back in the morning and we will see what we can do\u2019. After persisting the duty manager was called said they would definitely change my room the next day. We were given earplugs for the night \u2013 what a joke! In order to get any sleep that night we dragged the very comfortable mattress into the lounge and closed the bedroom sliding doors to keep the noise out. Good news: The next morning we packed our suitcases and went down to reception to hear their excuses; But were surprised when we were immediately offered another room in the East tower but on the north side with fabulous views over the Bellagio Fountains and Eiffel Tower (room 5899). Maybe the best view in Vegas? Same type of great room but far less noise and thus two very happy guests. Wicked Spoon: We had breakfast in the Wicked Spoon buffet restaurant included in our rate and if you timed it right could avoid the queues to get in. The choice of food was fabulous \u2013 anything from ice cream to sushi and pancakes to eggs benedict. There were endless supplies of coffee, tea and soft drinks. All included. Maybe the best buffet in Vegas? It is open 0800-1400 hrs for brunch and 1800-2200 for dinner. Pools Because it was \u2018out of season\u2019 only one of the pools was open and as the hotel was full the pool became very busy and unless you got there early (it opened at 0900 hrs although the hotel information said 0800) you would not get a free space. Many people seemed to put a towel on a chair and then not come back for hours. The management need to get this sorted. Overall we very much enjoyed our stay at The Metropolitan but this was in no small part due to the view from our room. It was cleaned to an acceptable standard and the one time no fresh toiletries were left, a phone call to housekeeping provided a lightening response. The beds are incredibly comfortable. Wonderful view from the soaking tub too. WE WOULD STAY AGAIN soon I hope.

I had originally reserved a Terrace Suite on the Cosmo's website, for an average of $400 per night. When we checked in, late on a Thursday evening, the clerk offered us an upgrade to the Wraparound for $75 per night. Initially, he offered a suite on a low floor, but when I explained that I was worried about noise from the nightclub, he was able to find us a north/east Wraparound on floor 53, with a great view of the Bellagio fountains and the Strip. (It wasn\u2019t really the 53rd floor; they skipped some floors in their numbering system.) It seemed like we had more leverage to negotiate location than if we'd booked the Wraparound to begin with, because he was trying to sell us on the upgrade. He was very nice and helpful, and we had no wait at all to check in. The room was fantastic! I loved the ability to control lights, etc. from the TV\u2014everything except the curtains, which are remote-controlled at Aria but not at Cosmo. It was incredibly fast and easy to make dinner reservations on the automated system. I also loved how, when you're flipping channels on the TV, there is a caption that names and summarizes what's playing on each channel. The room was beautifully decorated, and equipped with wineglasses, corkscrew, and other bar equipment. There was lots of freezer space, and enough room in the minibar for us to store a bottle of wine and some water. The free wi-fi worked great. We were surprised that the bathtub wasn't a Jacuzzi tub and didn't have a TV nearby. I was also disappointed that they pulled the coffeemakers out of the rooms after I made the reservation. But everything else was top-notch. And the terrace was incredible! It gave me a whole new outlook on the Strip. I almost didn't want to leave the room because the terrace view was so beautiful. Based on previous reviews, I had two worries: housekeeping, and noise from the nightclub. Housekeeping couldn't have been better! The room was spotlessly clean when we arrived, and there were enough towels and toiletries for our whole stay. So I would have been OK if the housekeeper never came at all. But in fact, they cleaned the room more promptly than at any other Strip hotel we've stayed at, even on busy weekend days. We put out the \"Please Clean\" tag when we left the room, and it was always immaculate when we returned, even though one time we were only gone for an hour and a half. The nightclub noise, on the other hand, was a bit of an issue. I had thought the 53rd floor would be safe, but my husband was kept awake for a while on Friday due to the noise. I could hear it, too, but not enough to keep me awake. It wasn't the music so much as the people screaming and the DJ shouting into the microphone. We were in the West Tower, but even though the nightclub is right under the south side of the East Tower, the east side of our room overlooked it closely enough that we could hear it. The north side of the East Tower, or the north or west sides of the West Tower, would be your best bets for quiet rooms. And of course, the higher, the better. The highest floor number in the West Tower is 61. The West Tower gym was pretty good. It cost $15, but we got 3-day passes for $38. They had all the usual equipment (bikes, ellipticals, stairclimbers, treadmills), plus a yoga room, weight room, and boxing room. I loved that the treadmills not only had TV, but also games and a Web browser. The Cosmo property overall is very elegant. The music in the buffet, casino and bars was great-- 80's songs I hadn't heard for years! The Chandelier bar is so pretty that people were constantly taking pictures in front of it. The property is obviously the current hot spot for young, dressed-up people to hang out. The casino and bars were always hopping! We had a slice of pizza at the unnamed, unsigned pizzeria, and it was truly delicious. Checking out did require a wait of about 15 minutes on Monday morning. There was a manager there apologizing for the wait and trying to get more agents set up. They offered express checkout, but I wanted to review the bill due to the fact that I'd used the minibar to store my own beverages. I don't know if there were actually any erroneous charges. The agent asked if I'd had anything from the minibar, I said no, and that was the end of it. I don't know if there were never any charges, or if she just took care of them. Overall, our experience at the Cosmopolitan was excellent. The terrace was especially unique and memorable. I would certainly stay there again in preference to almost any other hotel in Las Vegas, especially when the weather is nice enough to enjoy the terrace. The only reason our next reservation is at Aria rather than Cosmo, is that we're visiting during Spring Break, and I'm afraid of the nightclub noise, especially if we couldn't get a high floor. After a few months, when some other nightclub becomes the newest hotspot, Cosmo will be our go-to hotel in LV.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel, great service\u201d", "Author": "dandrewsx", "ReviewID": "UR119690821", "Content": "Stayed the weekend in mid-October.

U must be joking.\u201d", "Author": "Andrew N", "ReviewID": "UR119686086", "Content": "I stayed here on Marriott points (Platinum Member - I wish I could get them back) and paid for a second night. This is by far the worst hotel I've ever stayed in Las Vegas if not the World. I've been coming to Vegas for 25 years and I spend 200 plus night a year on business so I know a thing about hotels and except for bellman and this place sucked. Apart from our bellmen and the buffet restaurant manager the rest of the staff just do not care. The lines are very long to check in and the rooms are very poorly planned and everything is cheap looking. I think the designer must have stayed at the Venetian one night and tried to recreate the room from memory but more in that later. So let tell me tell you about this place. First my flight was late and the reservation was under my name. So I called the hotel concierge and told them the situation and that my GF was checking in and could she check in under my name. After a 20 minute hold I was told no problem, we made a note on the reservation. So I get off the place and the first voicemail was from my GF who told me they wouldn\u2019t let her check in. The second was that they finally let her check in after an hour but I needed to go give them my credit card. Well I get to the hotel and the lines to check in are huge (or maybe they are the complaint or we want to check out lines). So after 30 minutes in line I give them my credit card (American Express Platinum with no limit) and think everything is ok with the world. So I wake up in the morning, call for same day pick up/delivery of my laundry and fill out the sheet. After about an hour I call down stairs again. The excuse was there were busy and some would be right up. After another hour someone finally shows up and take my cloths. So then I go down to the buffet and try to charge to my room for some reason they say my credit card is not on file. Go figure. So the buffet manager comes over and he was great. He comp our breakfast after I told him what had happened. So after breakfast I go downstairs to get in yet another 20 minute line. When I get to the check in the guy tells me very rudely that my card was declined. I said really, it\u2019s an amex platinum with no limit so I hand it him and ask him to swipe. He does and guess what? nothing wrong with the card. I told him that if I had to spend another 20 minutes in line due to this again I would not be a happy camper. So I go to the pool and order a drink, guess what. Not happy. So finally after I get it all sorted out I go back to my room. So you've guessed it. No clothes. Dinners in an hour and then a concert and I have a t shirt, shorts and flip flops. So I call for my clothes. No-one seems to know where they are. So I missed dinner as they said they\u2019d call me back in an hour. So 1 hour and 30 mins later I call again. Talk to another person who says he'll call me back I tell him. Look in 45 mins I need to leave for a concert. My gf is all dressed and I look like a bum. I need clothes. Do I need to go buy some? Answer no. We'll call you back. Well I went to the concert in my best flip-flops, t-shirt and shorts. I get back to the hotel. No clothes. Call again. Spoke to yet another person. So the next morning when I wake up. I call down for a late check out and was told no. I needed to be out of the hotel by 11am no exceptions. We'll what happened to my clothes I ask. What clothes they say? So now I'm beyond pissed. Finally the room service person calls me back to say sorry the clothes where handed in too late for same day service. I asked why no-one called me to tell me this. Silence. So I tell them I'm checking out and moving to the Hilton. Please have my clothes deliver there. My clothes showed up and 6pm, 36 hours after I handed them in. So I was kicked out of the hotel without my clothes. Now this is a 5 start hotel. You know it is because they charge you $450 a night for a room. So I meet this guy in the bar of the Bellagio who tells me the whole finance problem with building the hotel and the company that they brought in to run it that has no hotel experience. Now everything makes sense. I asked why the room has a dish washer and no dishes and no microwave and no coffee maker and two TV's about 6 feet apart. Answer they were in a rush to get the hotel built so they slapped rooms and staff together and by no magic you get the Worst Hotel in Vegas.

Upon entering the room I immediately noticed gum wrappers on the floor inside the doorway - not a huge deal - but after entering the bathroom and seeing the condition (filthy) of the floors and more specifically the shower floor, I decided to call back to the front desk to see how long the wait for another room would be. I was told the room I was in was all that was available. Asked to speak to a manager and kept getting the same answer. Getting no assistance on the phone, I went back downstairs to the front desk. Waited in the long line again, and was told the room type I had initially reserved were still being cleaned, but I could wait. They took my cell phone number and said they would call me when my room was ready. I found a comfy chair and parked to get some work done (free wi-fi in the hotel is great, btw).

It did take almost 2 hours from when I first placed a call for a housekeeping item for them to bring it upstairs. I thought that was a little extreme. There were a few lightbulbs in the room that were burned out, but those were replaced during the day after I made a phone call. The second day I was there I did notice that housekeeping had left some trash behind on the floor after emptying the trash can - just carelessness. There was also a thick layer of dust on the wood blinds and lamps in the room - didn't look like they had been cleaned in months. The beds are very comfortable, but you can hear noise from nightclubs at night. Some things I found odd about the room: 1) the room was large and spacious with a sofa/sitting area, desk area, kitchen area and separate bedroom - and only one telephone in the entire room, by the bed. 2) it would have been nice to have a coffee maker in the room since there was a microwave, dishwasher and kitchen sink. I found it odd that a coffeemaker was not included. 3) the phone has a directory for housekeeping, room service, front desk, etc. - but each time you try to reach a specific department, you are routed to an operator who then has to transfer you again. Why have the listings for, what would appear to be, a direct dial to housekeeping or room service, when they don't work that way? The hotel is very nice and the furnishings/finishes are top notch. Has the potential to be a great hotel if they could just get their housekeeping and customer service issues worked out.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Batavia, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cClassy!\u201d", "Author": "BethRose640", "ReviewID": "UR119638013", "Content": "This was my first trip to Vegas and the Cosmopolitan certainly does impress. It is ultra modern. Our room was on the 38th floor and did not have a balcony.

Our room was 2 queen beds, no tub, but a huge shower that was fabulous and so relaxing! It was a kick to enter our room key into the door upon arriving and have all the lights and tv go on as if being welcomed home! We stayed 4 people in this room and it was long enough to accommodate all of our luggage. We found it strange that a room with 2 beds would only have 1 set of towels so we had to call housekeeping right away and they came fairly soon with an extra 3 sets of towels. All room lights, tv, wake up, etc. can be controlled from an electronic pad on the night table between the beds. One problem with that is that we had to cover it with a doubled washcloth since it lit up too brightly right next to someone's face. We did have dinner in the hotel at the Comme Ca. We found the service to be first rate. The 4 of us spent over $300 on food, drinks, and dessert. What I liked about the restaurants in this hotel is that they are on one floor dedicated to food, away from casino noise and smoke. Descending back towards the lobby, the chandelier bar is gorgeous. The open spaces in the hotel are quite noisy and I overheard someone behind me on the escalator commenting on that fact.

Our 2 night midweek stay here completed a 5 night business trip which began luxuriously at the Mandarin Oriental (separate review). While our stay here did not match the high bar set by the Mandarin, it was surprisingly pleasant for such a style-driven, trendy place. Unlike others, we encountered no major problems. It is well known the Cosmo has endured many wrongs since breaking ground--the economy, foreclosure, changes in concept and ownership (it was originally meant to be a residence/hotel). HOTEL OVERVIEW. The Cosmo is probably the largest Strip hotel squeezed into the smallest amount of acreage, hence it is the most vertical of properties. It is snuggled between the CityCenter complex and the Bellagio--actually, the short, built-in-the 70's timeshare Jockey Club is between the Cosmo and Bellagio--the Cosmo literally engulfs the Jockey Club on 3 sides, like a whale swallowing a tidbit of plankton. The Cosmo property sits perpendicular to the Strip, so its actual Strip footage is quite short--you can walk past it in under a minute. There are 2 towers. The square East Tower hovers over the Strip, with the Strip-side Boulevard Pool on its 4th level. All rooms in this tower seem to have terraces, with north, east and south facing rooms getting Strip views. North or Fountain view rooms (as in Bellagio fountains) are the best and cost more. The more rectangular, larger West Tower sits further back from the Strip, but still has views. It seems that not all of these rooms have terraces. The East Tower floors go up to 75, the West to 61, but both towers have no floors 13 or 40-49 (probably to appease Asian guests who consider 4 unlucky). The East Tower houses shops and most of the restaurants, the Boulevard Pool, plus the 3 level Chandelier Bar and a small fitness center (access fee). The West Tower has the Wicked Spoon Buffet, a much larger fitness center (complete with a boxing ring), the Sahra Spa and Hammam, 2 tennis courts, business center (also a FedEx office), meeting rooms, and the Bamboo Pool. Between the two are the casino on the ground level and ballrooms/meeting rooms. The Marquee Day and Nightclub also sits between the 2 towers, with its pools. There is interesting contemporary art throughout the public areas, including digital art seen on the columns in the front desk area, behind the front desk, and in the elevators. The most popular pieces seem to be the 6 feet tall high heeled shoes on the second level. There are even 5 \"Art-omat\" vending machines made from vintage cigarette machines that dispense small pieces of art for $5. And a Dutch design company called Droog has a museum-like shop on the casino level that has a chair made of Legos for $72,000. ARRIVAL. One enters the hotel by car in the West Tower. Self parking is subterranean and narrow (like the hotel), dark and a bit claustrophobic. Signs tell you how many spaces are available on each level, and each space has an easily seen red/green light above it telling you if its vacant (red/blue for handicapped spots). There are elevators from the parking levels in both the West and East Towers. The check-in desk is to the left of the aforementioned columns displaying mesmerizing digital art. There are1-4 lines, depending on crowds, with staff directing you. The receptionists come out from behind their desks to call you over to proceed. Our room was not ready, but check-in was completed and we were given keys, with instructions we would receive a call telling us our room number when it was ready, which is was in about 2 hours. ROOM. We had booked a non-fountain view Terrace Studio, but were upgraded a bit to a Terrace One-Bedroom. The rooms are similar in size (610-620 square feet), but the One-Bedrooms have Japanese soaking tub with a window, and a sliding door to separate the bedroom from the sitting area. We were in the East Tower facing south, with Strip views primarily of CityCenter and the MGM. We could see the Boulevard and Marquee pools below us--I was concerned because I had asked for a quieter room--but it turned out the Marquee Nightclub was only open our second night, and only one room, not the pool. Thus we experienced no noise, but weekends and Mondays (industry night) are a different story. I think the majority of rooms in both towers would experience some noise from the club. Keys are required to ascend the elevators. Upon entering our room, it was noticeable how little natural light extends deep into the room, especially with the windows being tinted. We first encountered the sitting area with a purple sofa (a pull-out), desk with a large HD TV above it (all the room functions can be controlled from the TV, and it also holds the usually printed guest services directory and Sirius radio stations), and a kitchenette (a vestige from the hotel's original residential concept) with an electronically sensored minibar/fridge (only the freezer shelf is empty), sink dishwasher and microwave. The cupboards were bare, and a tray of minibar snacks was glued to the counter where a cooktop might have been (it was falling apart from where guests had tried to move it). One then enters a large dressing area with the closet on one side and the bathroom entrance on the other. There is an upholstered storage trunk/bench in the middle, trimmed in leather, as are the walls. The bedroom is beyond, with a king bed, another TV, unique nightstands (but no alarm clock), and sliding door to the terrace and a peekaboo window into the shower and an opening into the tub. Both had venetian blinds that we couldn't figure out how to lower. The bathroom had dual sinks, and enclosed WC with wallpaper that on close inspection is of female figures, and a large tiled shower room that extends into the deep 2 person tub with window. The rooms were decorated by famed designer David Rockwell, who must have considered style over durability. A lot of the furniture and furnishings showed a considerable amount of wear and tear, especially for such a new hotel. I suppose an unexpectedly high level of debauchery occurs in these rooms--if only the walls could talk! Four lights were out in our room,the covering for the entryway light switch was on the floor, there was only one remote, and the shower knob was precariously loose. The single bedside phone had buttons for various hotel departments but no signs, only one that said \"butler services\". Indeed, pressing any button directed us to the butler, who then told us we were not entitled to butler services from this room. We were then told to dial 0, for the \"Beck and Call\" department, which handled the lighting issue as well as the request for a wake-up call, given that there was no alarm clock. We did receive maid service during the day, but no turndown service. From the room design, it seems that the hotel is geared primarily towards tech-savvy couples, or friend who don't mind being rather intimate, since most rooms are king bedded with the peekaboo bathrooms. There are 2-bedded rooms (City Rooms), but these are smaller (460 sq. ft.) and may not have a terrace. There is free Wifi throughout the hotel. POOLS. We toured the pools, but did not stay. The Boulevard Pool has multi-leveled lounging areas (some in the shallow pool itself), cabanas, a bar, cafe, and private VIP area. It was very crowded. The Bamboo Pool, which was supposed to be closed for the season but was nevertheless open, was less crowded, definitely a calmer vibe. There were 2 bars, and seemingly more lounging areas/cabanas. It is here that we saw a single child, the only one seen for our entire stay. The Marquee Club pools we saw only from our room's terrace. There seemed to be 2 large pools, plus some cabanas with their own pools, as well as 3-level Bungalow Lofts with a cabana, living quarters and rooftop pool/party deck. RESTAURANTS. Many interesting choices here. In fact, we came here to dine while staying at the Mandarin. We were particularly interested in the 2 Jose Andres restaurants, Jaleo (Spanish tapas) and China Poblano (Chinese and Mexican street food), as we are big fans of his restaurant The Bazaar at the SLS Hotel in Los Angeles. Both were delicious, with Jaleo definitely the more popular. We also tried (twice) Comme Ca (original location in Los Angeles), with its French bistro food. It has a Strip-view patio, and its $20 3-course prix-fixe lunch is a real bargain. Taste-wise, I would give the edge to Bouchon in the Venetian, which serves a similar menu. And we did try the \"secret\" pizza place, the cheapest food in the hotel--both the cheese slice and the pepperoni, sausage and meatloaf slice were excellent. Alas, we did not try the Wicked Spoon Buffet, but hop to in the future. Overall, our stay was a pleasant surprise. The hotel is part the the Marriott's Autograph Collection, so you can collect points here. It remains to be seen how the hotel withstands the test of time and the economy (can it possibly remain as current and upscale as Caesar's Palace, built in the 60's but constantly metamorphosing?), but for now, it is the newest and hippest Strip hotel.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Utrecht, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cDesigned hotel, superb view, average service!\u201d", "Author": "Lisanne-76", "ReviewID": "UR119626985", "Content": "Cosmopolitan is a well designed hotel with interesting technology gadgets.

The suite had 2 full bathrooms, a full kitchen ( Sub-Zero refig, dishwasher, glass cooktop, oven and microwave ) that sadly lacked utensils, (although we were told that housekeeping would bring up anything you wanted/needed), stackable washer and dryer, bar, living room with flat panel TV, small dining area, and huge bedroom with another wall mounted flat panel TV and a fabulous master bath. The bathroom had two separate vanities, each with it's own sink and storage, great lighting, especailly the lighted make up mirror , a huge shower and enormous soaking tub.Not to mention the thick fluffy towels and C.O.

We checked in early (11am)- we were given keys, and told they would be activated once the rooms were assigned, so no need to return to the front desk. Went to the pool (East side). Very pretty but small. You have to PAY for most of the lounge chairs in the sun by the pool.

Room was so spacious! The balcony was a wonderful addition to an already great modern room and we had views of the Bellagio fountains - i made sure we were in the west tower on the north side after reading all the negative noise reviews! We were on the 23rd floor and it was quiet. The Bamboo pool was open - maybe because of all the complaints, along with the Boulevard Pool. Bamboo is def more family friendly. Its a bit of a walk between the east and west towers but you can admire the nice lobby and chandelier bar as your are passing through the towers.. (Have at least one drink at the Chandelier Bat).

Food was okay but you are paying for the view - the water show was wonderful from this angle! 2nd night we ate at Bartolotta at the Wynn. Expensive but a very nice romantic dinner. Great atmosphere and food. We ordered room service for bfast once, we put the order outside our door at night to make sure we didnt have to wait the following morning. The other mornings we ate downstairs at the Vesper Bar....great pastries, coffee, and mimosas, etc!

We decided to go with The Lanai suite instead of the Wrap Around Terrace Suite. When we arrived our at 10:30am our room was ready so we check in went GREAT!! We got to our room and we instantly thought it was a good choice. After staying there we had VERY FEW COMPLAINTS. First the bad.........the lighting is terrible especially for women because you cant see a thing in the bathroom and it doesnt help that the room is decorated in deep dark colors. The kitchen area table is very high and the bench seating is very low and uncomfortable so if your entertaining its a huge pain!! The sofa which appeared to be large in photos is very small and not to mention useless because you cant lay or sit on it. The TV system upstairs in the bedroom area is operated on a ipad type system and its difficult to figure out. Now the doors.....the doors to go to your lanai weigh about a million pounds and they are soooooo hard to open. The door leading into the room is the same way so that was a huge pain in the but. Going to the Bamboo Pool was simple and worked out great. Just make sure that when you make your reservation that the pool will be open because it closed while we were there because it was the end of the seasons. The Boulvard pool is a simple walk from the Lanai Suites. Now the GREAT.......the service was fabulous!! Housekeeping did a GREAT job everyday!! Room Service always arrived faster then they said it would take when we orderd. The Front desk employees were very prompt and very nice. The entire hotel is very clean and the casino service was fabulous as well!!

The crystals that they have everywhere hanging are beautiful. The view facing the Bellagio from the 54th floor was beautiful. Now the negatives... First....we came in for a PGA tournament. When we arrived we got our room key and went up to the 55th floor. First problem....your ears will pop and it threw our heads off as if we were in an airplane. It was horrible. Got to the room, the keys didn't work. When back down the horrible elevator to get new keys....back up and we had 1 bed when we requested 2. Back down and got a new room....back up to the 54th floor and got into the room to see it hadn't even been cleaned yet. Back down again to tell them and they informed us it would get taken care of. We went to dinner and to see the Elvis show...(DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY) went back to the hotel to the room to see it still wasn't cleaned. Went back down, complained...got a $150 food credit...and they finally got us into another room around 12 midnight. The room: As stated, we had a beautiful view, but the way they set up the room was ridiculous. First, the beds were full size. I do not understand the use of full size beds in hotels at all. We were at Treasure Island for a few days prior to coming to Cosmo and there beds were queens and VERY comfortable. The bathroom is huge! There is a huge shower and tub,& enclosed toilet area. The problem was that there is a huge cut out in the drywall between the bathroom & bedroom. There was a blind there, but if someone is blow drying their hair early...everyone will wake up. There was no way to stop any noise from the bathroom from coming into the bed area. Very stupid design. Also, as we were unpacking, I found a little pink/orange pill laying on the ground. It was none of ours and luckily we didn't have any little kids who could have possibly eaten it. I don't know what it was, but it was obvious they didn't vacuum from the previous people. We had a big group...about 12 of us...and we went to the French restaurant there. 2 people like their meals. A couple of the men ordered the veal dinner which for men, was more of an appetizer. The restaurant was a joke and I wouldn't waste my money there at all. The selection of food was average. The Bellagio puts on a wonderful dinner buffet and it's right next door. If you can get past the elevators popping your ears and messing with your head from the speed of it, the noise from the bathroom, and not the best restaurant selections...then this is your place.

Our studio with terrace was huge, with a great bathroom (separate toilet and shower), spa bath and double vanity with excellent lighting, a large living room with huge flat screen TV, flowing through to the king size bedroom with another flat screen TV, and then onto a spacious terrace with really comforable lounging furniture.Five star plus for style and comfort - no doubt. The public casino floor is exactly as you would expect of a major Vegas property - glitzy and tacky at the same time. Smoking is allowed, as is wandering aimlessly with all manner of drinks in hand. There is a constant flow of humanity at all hours. Dress codes are loosely enforced to non-existent! There are many bars and restaurants scattered between the first and third floors. Our eating experience at Jaleo (Spanish Tapas) on the second floor was outstanding. The New York pizzeria tucked down a little corridor beside Jaleo is well worth checking out too. Now to the downsides. Check in was comparatively prompt but no attention was paid to our repeated requests for a quiet room (at time of making the booking, and again on check in). First issue - under no circumstances stay in a South facing room if you want any peace. The day and night club, Marquee, on the fourteenth floor throbs and pulses from 10 am to 5 am - we were on the 61st of 75 floors and could not use our balcony at all, and even with the double glazed doors closed the noise was unbearable. To the credit of the front desk staff they responded immediately to our complaint after one night and gave us a different room - on the North facing side - with stunning views of the Bellagio fountains and no noise!!!! They obviously have a lot of problems with the noise - I believe it makes almost half the rooms uninhabitable!! Another criticism was that the studio rooms with terrace were clearly advertised to have a kitchenette with microwave and dishwasher, which influenced our decision to stay there. They do, but there isn't a single dish or electric kettle to make the space functional. When I asked for a couple of mugs and some tea bags I was told that I would have to get them from room service - at a cost (this didn't seem right for a five star property - especially in view of their misleading advertising). The third problem was the very long queues (first to pay, and then for a table allocation) for the buffet breakfast - there were many free tables but insufficient staff to clean and reset them in order to keep up with very heavy demand. We were there for four days and 3 out of 4 mornings the queue time was about half an hour (there were two conferences in town and the place was packed!) It's fair to note that once you got a table the breakfast/brunch buffet was the best we have ever seen anywhere on our travels!! Staff were very pleasant and polite, but often just smiled and gave you a firm \"I'm sorry but we can't help\". For example we offered to have a simple room service breakfast which would have cost the hotel much less than the buffet (which was part of our deal) - but that was too hard! The teabag incident was just another irritant - it would have cost nothing to make us happy and indeed the person we spoke to said they often get the same complaint! Another TA reviewer mentioned that you should register any concerns with the manager if you want action - I would endorse that! We enjoyed a very reasonable room rate including breakfast - having booked early 2011 not long after the hotel was opened for business.

This is one of the best hotels I have EVER stayed in, and I have stayed in an over water bungalow larger than my own house in Bora Bora, so that is saying a lot! The standard rooms are HUGE, and the bathroom was larger than my bedroom at home. Every detail is attended to perfectly, I only wish I could take that room home and turn it into a home, it was beautiful. Most of the rooms have terraces that are very large and offer amazing views of Vegas. I really could not believe how nice the rooms were. The bathrooms are seriously to die for, mine had a jetted tub and a separate shower that was enormous, I definitely got use out of the tub after the long days of working at the conference. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel, the staff were friendly and professional and everything was so sparkly, shiny and beautiful, but not cheesy like a lot of the fancy hotels in Vegas. I have to say that for the money, this hotel would totally be worth it! You will be surprised at how large the rooms are, and how beautifully appointed. This hotel had a fab designer that is for sure, the use of textures in this hotel's design scheme is seriously beyond anything I have ever seen at a hotel. The only thing you will want to look out for is the exorbitant amount of money they charge for room service. A couple of pastries and coffee was close to $25, for that amount of money, you could go to the Wicked Spoon, the buffet on the 2nd floor of the hotel and have an entire array of pastries, breakfast, desserts and whatever you want basically. That is the only thing I would watch out for, but what hotel does not charge an arm and a leg for room service? A MUST is the Wicked Spoon Buffet, we ate at 4 different buffets while in Vegas and this was BY FAR the most amazing buffet any of us had ever been to. I cannot explain it, you must go!

The bedroom had a sliding door that could be closed so you didn't hear any noise in the hallway.

Note: you can reserve chairs the day before at the Boulevard pool, which is highly recommended. We ate at two of the restaurants in the hotel.. the Henry for breakfast, and the Wicked Spoon for Brunch. Both very good, but expensive. We did eat at two excellent restaurants for dinner, ONDA at the Mirage, excellent Italian, and BOA in the Forum shops, excellent steakhouse (though I still think I prefer Delmonicos for steak).

We soon got to grips with working the lights etc which i thought would be a bit troublesome as lots of reviews said they had trouble working it all out! I have one complaint though, the staff who cleaned the rooms used to have a cigarette break on our terrace and didn't hide the fact as they stamped them out on the terrace floor, i kept finding them! Probably i am not the only guest that has experienced it. The security guards used to do it also!

And the door there is really weird - it closes very slow, and then at the end it suddenly and very forcefully snaps. It's fully automatic and very powerful. Any person concerned with the safety would slow it down at the end, not speed it up. Also, all fully automatic doors that I know off (elevators, garage doors, automatic tailgates have safety measures to prevent jamming fingers (like light or pressure detectors). This door neither had any safety signs, nor any safety measures. And I'm not kidding when I say that it closes forcefully - I have demonstrated to the hotel security person how their door breaks a pencil. Back to my finger, it turned blue. I've immediately called their help desk to bring me ice (which wasn't easy to do when you're in a strong pain) saying that I have an injury. It took them 10 mins to bring me ice, which was brought by the above mentioned security person. I guess they were more concerned with the fact that they had an injury on property than with the fact that I had an injury and needed ice. That morning instead of a conference, I had to go to an urgency care. I got a splint at the medical facility and had strong pain. Needless to say, it's hard to work with a splint on your right hand. It's not convenient to shake people's hand or do your emails in that kind of a situation. The hotel didn't offer to compensate the medical bill or stay or inconvenience. They've sent me to their insurance company, which a week late wrote me a letter that the doors are fine and that it was my own fault. So if you have to stay there, be aware of the doors.

We got a free upgrade to a fountain view (we had originally booked a regular Balcony room). We would definitely pay for a fountain view if necessary, it was amazing sitting outside watching the Bellagio fountain and seeing the Strip light up at dusk. I only have two relatively minor gripes: 1) No in-room coffee makers. This really threw me off, since the room had a dishwasher and microwave! 2) 11am checkout. This also really threw me off, since I've found noon to be a pretty standard Vegas checkout time at other hotels. I stayed at Encore last year, which was also beautiful, but I would give the Cosmo a tiny edge over Encore because of the better location and amazing balconies.

The room I stayed in was 6178, a wraparound terrace suite with a spectacular view of the fountains and strip. We were entranced by the fountains and spent hours just sitting out on our deck looking out at our incredible view. The room was well appointed, the housekeeping friendly and attentive and the bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on. I'm not exaggerating - it was that comfortable. During our trip, we got married in the Cosmo's wedding suite (room 3678) with 35 of our friends and family. The Cosmo assisted us with every last detail and were great to work with. Everyone in our party said the food was the best wedding food they've ever had. It was delicious and beautifully present. Their photographer did a great job and the bartender was attentive and engaging. There are lots of wonderful restaurants in the Cosmo with the buffet being the best I've ever experienced in Vegas. Not cheap, but worth it. I love this resort- the vibe, the people, the art, the easy access to the strip, central location and the rooms themselves.

What sets this hotel apart from other Vegas Strip hotels is the availability of outdoor balcony rooms, so we splurged and got a wraparound suite for two nights. My first disagreement with many of the prior reviews is the check-in experience..ours was smooth...five minute wait...in fact that was the longest we ever had to wait in our five front desk interactions all at various times of the day. We had arrived early....1pm...and wanted a Bellagio view wraparound in the West tower ( quieter..based on previous reviews ) They had one available immediately on the 22nd floor West tower NE corner. Great...beautiful view of the fountains...only problem was that it was right over the day/night club pool that everyone complains about as far as noise. How bad could the noise be? Well it was bad...The amplified music was exceed only by the amplified shouts and screams of the DJ...until about 3am in the morning. So the next morning we made a quick visit again to reception...asked for something quieter...and got fixed up with a wrap on the 27th floor of the NE corner of the East tower. Totally different experience. The NE corner of the East tower is in my opinion the best wraparound location...no party pool noise...nice fountains view to the north ( although you don't want to be much lower than the 25th floor or your north view will be dominated by the Bellagio bell tower and massive Bellagio sign underneath it ) The east view off the wrap balcony is of the Paris mock Eiffel tower, Planet Hollywood and its pools across the street, and the MGM to the south. Some street noise from the Strip...but nothing that closing the slider doors couldn't block out. The room switch wasn't totally seamless...we had to inquire at reception a few times...each time dealing with a different individual...always pleasant ...notes kept between them on their computer program...housekeeping was the issue..never got the promised phone call...but got the cleaned room. Then I realized in the second wraparound that I had left a book outside on the balcony lounger of the first wrap....again mentioned that as we passed the reception counter. They made a call to housekeeping, and promised a call back to my cell as we were out and about. I thought 'yeah, right'....but twenty minutes later I got a call from their lost and found head..they had the book...just go down to The Wicked Spoon Buffet on the second floor..tell the hostess..sounded weird....but she contacted Scott the head of the lost and found, and he brought out the correct missing book...signed a form...showed picture ID...fast and simple process. I would have to agree with the comments on the touchy sensors in the refrig for the bar goods...we open the door twice and later noted two charges on the TV folio for room charges...another reception pass by easily corrected that. Should not have opened the frig door...in fact just think of the entire kitchen as merely decorative...since its not really functional without utensils. This is a beautiful hotel with unique whimsical art scattered about the common areas. Very high tech. Massive with 3000 rooms. Perfect location on the Strip. Its main attraction for us was the outdoor balcony above the Bellagio fountains. Beautiful during the day and magical at night with the lighting. Fall and Spring would seem to be the best time to enjoy evenings on the balcony.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chelmsford Essex UK", "Title": "\u201cComfy but Cold\u201d", "Author": "SunbedSpeedy", "ReviewID": "UR119253955", "Content": "This was our second visit to Las Vegas, staying at The Flamingo (Go Rooms) last time around. Needless to say we enjoyed our visit to Vegas even though it was quite chilly on a couple of days. We are not gamblers but as 50+ year old we just enjoy the atmosphere of the place and the shows. My take on The Cosmopolitan though.... When we arrived we were told our room was not yet ready so we would have to wait about an hour or so (this was at 4pm) or we could take an upgrade to a one bed-roomed suite for the *discounted* fee of an extra $50 per day which we declined. (There appears to be a pattern forming with this offer). We eventually got our room on the 29th floor East Tower overlooking the Bellagio fountains and was very happy with the room. The bed was the best ever. The kitchen area was ok with a fridge, a microwave and a dishwasher. Now that in itself is great but, if you want to eat your own food make sure you take your own plates, cutlery, kettle etc etc, I mean what is the point in supplying a kitchen with no utensils? That is my only negative with regards to the room. As far as noise goes. Like I said, we were on the 29th floor and with the door to the balcony closed, if we listened out for it we could hear the music coming from the strip and nightclub but in all honesty, a passing car going past the front of my house makes more noise so noise was not an issue. The buffet at The Wicked Spoon was excellent and the choice amazing but it was a bit hit and miss as to whether or not you were in a long queue to get into the restaurant or not. All in all though, I wouldn't stay at The Cosmopolitan again. It was a bit to cold and clinical for my liking and the floor with the restaurants on reminded me of walking through a shopping mall. I prefer the more earthy type place like The Flamingo and such although I wish I could take Cosmo's room with me.

This is a top-notch resort/hotel/casino. The staff is much more friendly than in the places we usually stay while in Vegas \u2013 Paris, Flamingo, Caesars, PH, and Bellagio. The room was large, clean, with a balcony. Our view was one that overlooked the 2 pools and into City Center. We\u2019ve seen enough of the fountains that I was ok with not having the Bellagio view. We had the 51st floor (\u201chigh up\u201d as recommended by previous reviewer to avoid the noisy party pool). The floor numbering is a bit off I\u2019d say though. The 17th floor pool is only 2 or 3 floors above the 4th floor pool, so the 51st floor is actually only like the 40th, but was fine for noise avoidance. The table game employees are the friendliest I\u2019ve seen lately, I hope it\u2019s not because the place is new. The casino seems to be smaller than we\u2019re used to which is what made it feel more intimate. I liked that. And the 4th floor pool was perfect. It overlooks the strip, not that you really notice. The food served by the pool was great, as were the prices for the drinks up there. Nabbing a pool chair is near impossible and anything else out of the pool area gets taken almost as quickly. If desperate you can rent one of the large bed pool chairs - $400 but includes $200 worth of your bar/food bill. 2 tips for the pool. 1) It opens at 9, get there before 9. 2) Ordering drinks is much better from the bar than from a waitress. I asked the bar tender to throw a little extra vodka into the drinks - he said no problem. The only thing about this place that didn\u2019t fit exactly to my taste was in the morning when I go down to get coffee. Usually in other Vegas hotels, it\u2019s nice & quiet. Kind of relaxing for me to stroll around. Boy, not here at the Cosmopolitan. The bars are all still packed, with everyone dressed up, having fun. The place is still going strong at 6:00am.

I wasn't impressed with the pool. We went to the Bamboo pool which was tiny and overcrowded and at closing time (6 pm) it took us 20-minutes to catch an elevator from the 14th floor pool deck back up to our floor. This was ridiculous for a new hotel, in my humble opinion. The elevators were slow and consistently packed with people. We would have taken the stairs but couldn't find a staircase to our floor. To be fair, we didn't try the other pools because our stay was only 2 nights. Also, the hotel is trying to be super high tech by having all of the controls for the room (including the lights) on the television. It seems like a great idea, but the remote control was crappy and half of the time you had to be standing directly in front of the TV to make it work. I longed to be able to just easily flip on a light switch. Also, the hotel directory was only accessible on the TV which was slow to access and I found hard to navigate. It would have been nice to have a printed brochure (I know, I\u2019m so old school) to read about all of the amenities. In addition, when we checked in, there was no lotion, conditioner or shampoo in the room. We made a quick call to the \"beck and call\" staff and they quickly brought it up, but it seemed silly to have to ask for. Also, the room has a window into the shower from the main room which I guess would be awesome if you were watching a stripper shower, but for our girl\u2019s weekend was just kind of awkward. There are blinds available, but you can still see the person's silhouette and it just seems a little too sexy for me. Also, there isn't much privacy in the toilet area as the door into the commode is just a half glass door.

However we complained and were given a $50 voucher to use on food and drink in any bar or restaurant. Then the hotel offers a kitchen however you cannot use the fridge as its full of mini bar drinks. We asked for them to be removed and were told it would cost $20 however again we quite clearly stated we were not going to pay and they emptied it free of charge.

We used the Boulevard Pool each day, though you have to get up early to get a good sunbed as all the ones around the pool were day beds which you had to pay for. Alot of the sunbeds were in the shade quite a bit but I doubt many people go to vegas to sunbathe! The pool was mainly shallow so was fantastic to sit in in the hot heat of vegas and drink.

Have to say our favourite place to eat however was the Pizza parlour which is like a little secret in the hotel. Its not advertised and is down a corridoor in the hotel, but its easy to find (just look for the people heading that way) and you get a massive slice of pizza for $3!!! or you can buy a whole pizza for $20.

We were a bit disappointed with the dry cleaning/laundry service as a few of my husband's shirt were returned poorly pressed. We stayed for 7 days and visited a majority of the restaurants and all of the bars at the hotel. Every meal we had was very good and the service matched. The Bond bar on the first floor was so much fun every night. The nightclub was also very fun on Monday. Not sure if I would recommend the night club any other night (it was closed Tues and Wed) unless you reserved a table/paid for bottle service as the lines were a bit crazy. We also used the business center a few times and they were super helpful. The concierge was also amazing at obtaining reservations at restaurants and finding show tickets. I did spend one of the days at the spa, and it was completely worth the price. I had the most relaxing massage and facial. If you have time, go to the spa!!

When coming to this new venue for a close friend's Bachelorette Party, I was thrilled by the decor and the set up of the rooms. That is the reason for the one star.

They were disorganized, rude, would not add anyone else's name to the reservation of 7 girls (which we had disclosed to them upon booking the room) without begging at the front. The parking is confusing and not easily accessible. The casino is cold and doing its best to mirror a spa with horribly snobby attendants. This is a casino.

It's our money that we are OPENLY giving over to you. Not even The Wynn has this much attitude. Then, came the situation that I have discussed with a lawyer and about which I am still unsure of what to do. We had purchased tickets for a Fat Boy Slim concert on their roof during this Labor Day weekend celebration. The lines, as you can imagine, were insane and everyone was trying to get in. We had tickets, so we tried to find the difference between tickets and no tickets. When I attempted to ask the bouncer (whose name escapes me but he has a tattoo on his arm with his anniversary and looks almost identical to Steve-O) where we needed to stand, he literally turned his back to me and would not answer my question. I thought he didn't hear me, so I said, \"Excuse me, can you please tell me...\" and before I could finish he put his finger inches from my nose and said, \"I'm busy and will deal with you later.\" then walked away. We thought fine, we'll just wait here. After awhile, we got in our correct line and waited. It was divided into two sections to keep a pathway clear for other guests (which makes total sense, again I'm a reasonable human). When we walked (as instructed by another equally angry bouncer) to the other part of the line, Steve-O waited for us to get to the other side and then yelled, \"You dumb (expletive) need to get in the right line. The end of the line is back there.\" I replied, \"The other bouncer just told us to go here. We have tickets. Why are you talking to us like this?\" He then ran to me and got inches from my face. He screamed he was going to kick me out and raised his hand like he was going to strike me. I was terrified and everyone in line was just staring, confused. I responded with, \"You are being incredibly aggressive and if you are kicking me out, you need to decide that, but your tone and aggression are unnecessary.\" Seeing as how I was right and he had created a seen, he huffed and puffed and walked away. Others in line said, \"Oh, he just did that to me too. I am trying to sell my ticket.\" They were always females saying this. It was a disgusting experience and was, by the definition of the word, assault. I will never return here. When I attempted to report this while there, I was ignored and told that a separate company hires out these people and they can't speak to it. I paid to stay at that hotel for 3 nights. Why would you not at least direct me to the person with whom I could file this report? Throughout the weekend, I heard, \"We are only 7 months old\" from a lot of employees. That's completely understandable that there will be hic-ups and mistakes! But, so much aggression from one employee, I was shaking and had to return to my room?! Then, to have no one wanting to help me at least report it?! I am not good at confrontation, so I let it go. But, for any and all people that are nice and want to experience Vegas in the fun, light-hearted way most trips there are intended to be, do NOT stay in this hotel. You are not safe, it is very expensive, and the staff is rude beyond anything I have ever experienced. I was simply left without words. From the valet, to the maintenance people - no one appears to be happy working here.

We visit Vegas 2-3 times/year and typically stay at a Wynn property (although we have stayed a most of the large hotels and resorts in the area), but were curious to experience and explore this hotel. Here is a very brief description of our stay: --The check-in process took over an hour. Not all of the registration stations were staffed - this on a Friday afternoon, prime time for traffic. --Upon getting to our room, we found that it was already occupied! Imagine the shock of the other guest, who was just settling into her room. If privacy is important, DON'T STAY HERE! --It took another hour to straighten out our room situation. We ended up in a mini-suite on the 56th floor overlooking the Strip. Although the room is nice looking, the soundproofing was non-existent. We could hear pool conversations - no kidding! - from the pool located directly underneath us. FIFTY FOUR FLOORS underneath us. My husband (a contractor) said that they used the cheapest possible sliding doors/glass, which had zero effect on blocking noise. If sleep is important, DON'T STAY HERE! --We ordered breakfast the following morning and it took almost 2 hours to arrive. There is not a coffeemaker in the room (although there was a dishwasher, microwave, and a refrigerator), so be prepared to either go downstairs for your morning java or wait. If prompt service is important, DON'T STAY HERE! --The sports bar/book is very small. There are actually two on different levels of the hotel, and both have very limited seating. As we typically spend considerable time watching and betting on games, this was a problem for us. Once, on Saturday night at about 10p, we finally found a spot to sit, catch up on games and have a drink. Unfortunately, the server told us that our spot was being reserved for some of THEIR managers and that we had to give up our seats! If you don't want to be kicked out of your space for management, DON'T STAY HERE! --Our room was never, ever, once cleaned nor attended to the entire stay. Yes, we called housekeeping. No, they never came up. During one call I was told that, \"due to staffing issues, not all rooms were cleaned today.\" If you expect your sheets and towels to be cleaned daily, DON'T STAY HERE! --Using the pool chairs was impossible - there were very few available at any of the three pools, and all were 'reserved' before our attempts to find a spot at 9a.

I gave it 4/5 stars only because of some housekeeping issues and the pool situation/value. None of my complaints are deal breakers - I would absolutely, positively stay here again and recommend it to anyone. The location is perfect too! It is pricey to stay here. Food/drinks, entertainment, shopping are all high-end, and so are the costs. If you can afford the room though, you should be able to afford everything else. From the moment we arrived in Las Vegas, we felt like rock stars courtesy of The Cosmopolitan. The limo driver was so friendly and helpful, he gave us his recommendations for the resort and took great care of us. Check-in was a bit crowded, but the staff was efficient and welcoming. The bellman escorted us to our room, a wrap-around terrace suite, which was in the West Tower on the 17th floor. Upon entering the room, the bellman started to show us around, and then paused. He asked us if we would mind noise and then warned our room would be pretty loud as he opened the curtains. Our balcony directly overlooked the Marquee club - I could've tossed a beach ball with the people in the pool. The bellman recommended we request another room, and the staff accommodated our request immediately, relocating us to an identical room on the 52nd floor of the East Tower. A few notes - the floors are numbered \"creatively\". Our East Tower room was on the 52nd floor, but the building didn't have that many levels (don't believe what the elevator tells you)...we were maybe 25 floors up from street level and about half way up the building tower. Our first room on the 17th floor was in no way that high above street level. It could've been 6 or 7 floors up, but no higher than that. Even on the 52nd floor, our room was LOUD. The boulevard pool had live concerts two out of three nights, and we could still hear the Marquee club even though we were a decent distance from it. If you are a light sleeper, I strongly recommend a room on the north/Bellagio side of either tower. The not-so-great comments: Housekeeping gets a big fail. The previous guest left two giant pans of what I assume was barbecued meat in the oven. I saw something in there, opened the door and nearly fell over from the smell. There were places in the room that look like they hadn't been dusted in a long time, makeup on the floor of the powder room, two broken lamps and no hairdryer. We called, told them all of the above (very nicely) and someone came up to clean, but missed the makeup and skipped dusting. I would've expected after we said something, they would've remedied the housekeeping, but it was just made \"okay\". Our first room had all sorts of throw pillows, books and even colored pencils on the desk. This room was stripped down, or maybe pilfered by previous guests. The pool situation at The Cosmopolitan is interesting, at least during our visit. The boulevard pool had two concert stages on the decks, which limited the available seating areas significantly. We tried to go to the Marquee when it opened and followed the map we were given at check-in (and the signage) when a security guard politely informed us that we were on the wrong floor and that she'd begged the management to change that. We went down to the Marquee entrance and the staff there said the club hadn't opened yet (even though it was past their published opening time) and he had no idea when it would open. So, we headed to the Boulevard pool, arrived maybe 15 minutes after they opened and found that all the chairs had been claimed. The host station offered a daybed to us, for the low, low price of $200 - $100 of which was rental, $100 minimum food and beverage - but warned the pool was closing at 3 pm that day because of the concert. We eventually found a little chair and sat in the water with our $15 cocktails. I just can't fathom paying to sit in a lounge chair. Maybe if I had a few friends with me, I could've justified it, but for two of is, it seemed really pricey. The kitchen is a total waste of space. There isn't a glass, plate, fork, coffee maker or mug anywhere to be found. I guess you could ask housekeeping to bring it, but we didn't bother. The Great Comments: The interior decor in the room is so nice. It is very chic and elegant, and contrasts so well with the bright lights of Vegas. Amazing linens, comfortable bed. I liked being able to control everything from the television (though sometimes the light switch situation didn't work exactly right). I love having a balcony. That is so unique in Vegas, and it really is fun to be able to go outside and experience the strip from high above. This hotel is large enough, but not overwhelming. You don't feel like you walk for days like at other properties. It smells great - I only wish they would package that aromatherapy scent they use into some sort of candle or diffuser. People watching here is fantastic. Pretty girls, good looking guys, stylish, hip crowd. We felt a little out of place sometimes, but on closer evaluation, there really was a diverse group of guests ranging from partying friends to business people to couples of all ages on holiday. Gaming is really good. The Cosmopolitan doesn't have that constant din of slot machines like other casinos. You hear music first. The dealers were all very nice, and the Identity membership seems like a great program. Shopping is unlike any other property in town. The boutiques are exactly that - boutiques selling merchandise you can't easily find at other branded stores in town - but the prices are equivalent to designer shops elsewhere. I love AllSaints and Stitched. Restaurant choices are extensive. Definitely check out the hidden pizza place. A good deal for $22 for a whole pie. The Wicked Spoon buffet lives up to the hype. It is the best buffet in town. I've reviewed the other restaurants we visited during our stay separately... The Sahra Spa is fantastic. It is just what you'd expect from a property of this quality and offers a great experience. I had a facial and massage. The staff was so wonderful, the amenities were perfect and it was a nice treat. Don't miss The Cosmopolitan...just be sure to bring your trousers with the deepest pockets.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Blackpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "mgarner26", "ReviewID": "UR118779575", "Content": "First off its my first review so be kind but i have just returned from a FABOULOUS stay at the cosmo.

We had our own private balcony looking directly onto the Bellagio Lake. The room itself was immaculate with two large flatscreen tvs, which controlled all lighting, airconditioning and entertainment (my techy loving fiance was in his element in this place). There was a large Japanese hot tub with views onto the lake as you soaked those muscles and a large shower area too. In various parts of the room were large books with different artistic themes (such as modern art & profiles of up and coming movie directors). The bed was so comfortable, i was out like a light. The view was the main selling point; with our little private balcony and couch, we sat and watched those waters dance. Although we could barely hear the music playing, it was still spectacular. The casino was beautiful and that Chandalier Bar was fantastic. Although we didn't go in for a drink this time, I was happy viewing it from the escalators and checked all three floors. It was very busy with people who were preparing to make way to the club. The Vesper bar was equally stunning and again worth a look. We hate late dinner at Secret Pizza, which was easy to find after directions from the forum guys. A great wee hideout with pizza to die for. There was an array of pizza types not just your usual cheese, hawaii , pepperoni. Don't forget to check out the screens at the reservation; they were very impressive to say the least but I was a little disappointed they didn't change more often so I could experience them fully. My only annoyance about this hotel was that I booked one night and that we didn't stay longer here; seriously couldn't rate this one any higher.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gresham, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cGreat rooms , nice people but, small , and few pools , needs help.\u201d", "Author": "Kari B", "ReviewID": "UR118709151", "Content": "This place could be a awesome all around place.

The hotel itself is very modern, and very beautiful. The layout and design was very nice, and the location is perfect. The rooms are exactly as the pictures are on here, and compete with the very best rooms on the strip. (We were staying in a terrace suite). We did have quite a few issues with staying here, and I am really unsure if we will stay here again in the future. When I booked my room, and another room three months prior I had requested a high floor, and a fountain view. Upon checking in I was told that the hotel was at capactiy and they would try to honor our request When we checked in it was 9am, and we were told that we would be called when our rooms were ready. I asked what was the normal check in time, and was told 3pm. We left our bags at the bell hop desk and headed to the Holsteins for some early lunch. The food here was overpriced, but the burgers were awesome. We toured the hotel, and checked out city center while waiting for our rooms. At 3 pm we headed back to the hotel figuring our rooms would be ready, but we had not received a call to let us know what our room numbers were. We headed to the front desk, and waited in the long line again. Once at the desk (now being 3:15pm) We asked about our rooms, and were told that only one room was clean, and the other room should be clean within the hour. I expressed my dissatisfaction considering that the normal check in time is 3pm, and my group had been up now for about 15 hour since we came from the east coast. The desk clerk then told us that our rooms were on the 24th floor, and that we could head up and wait for the maid to finish if we wanted. I then asked if there was any way that we could get a higher room, and was told that we couldn't since the hotel was at capacity, and rooms were on a first come first serve basis (I even offered to wait longer if I had to, or pay for an upgrade if needed). I asked if it was at least a fountain view, and was told that a lot of rooms have a fountain view. Finally at 4 pm we made it into our cleaned room, and went to call the bell desk for our bags. Only to find out the phone doesn't work at all. I used my cell to call the front desk, but it died in the process, and my charger was in my bag at the bell desk. I had to go back down stairs to get someone for the phone, and to get my bags. An hour later they came and fixed the phone, and we finally got to rest for nap for a little while only to hear loud booming music coming from the pool below. Later that night after we rested for a little while I went back down to the front desk to find out if there was anyway I could get moved to a higher floor, or across the hall due to the noise. I was told no, but they did give me a $75 food credit for the issues. That night when we were trying to go to sleep at mid-night it was near impossible due to the loud music that blared until 3am. The following morning I called the front desk, and expressed my concerns about the noise, and was told it was due to a concert at the boulevard pool, and it should be quite tonight. I explained to the lady that I could already hear booming music at 1 in the afternoon so I was worried it was coming from Marquee the day-club. She explained it was closed on Sunday's and so it should be quiet at night. I again offered to pay to be moved, and was told she couldn't do anything. Had to call front desk to replace a light in the shower. Called first thing in the morning and no one came. Called again later in the afternoon, and it was replaced within 30 minutes. Sunday night all was quiet :) Monday night the music was LOUDER than Saturday night, and you could hear the ppl screaming!!!!!! Apparently it was the music from Marquee, and you could clearly hear everything the DJ was saying until 2 in the morning. I know it's Vegas, but when you charge this much for a room I should be able to get a good nights sleep.

Danny the bartender was awesome and really made you feel at home! We ate at the Secret Pizza place and like the majority of people said, its REALLY good pizza! The buffet was good, alot to choose from! Had breakfast and dinner there. The Vesper bar made great drinks as well as the Chandelier bar which is beautiful!!! I chose not to have maid service while I was there because I've had bad experiences with maids in the past, not with Vegas but other places like them stealing things so I just hung the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign and that was that! We did see alot of maids around our floor though so it looks like they were doing their job! Casino was nice. Not at all smoky even though people are smoking everywhere!! Waitresses in the casino were very freindly and always there when you needed them. We played at the slots mostly and wound up winning the last 2 days we were there!!!

Seven college girlfriends & I, all 40 years old, had an incredible time. We were upgraded to a Premium Terrace view, 49th floor, in the West Tower. Our room was simply incredible. I was shocked at the size of the balcony. All eight of us easily had our evening cocktails on the deck together. The room was well-stocked and in excellent condition, too. Only minor complaint was that there was no coffee maker, but a dishwasher with no dishes?? NO refridgerator space, only the freeze section was empty. We did have to ask a maid for clean glasses, after two days, but she quickly apologized, refilled our glasses and was very pleasant. We only used the Bamboo Pool & had to get there BY 9:00, to find 4+ seats together, or available, for that matter. Even that pool, by later afternoon, was crowded. Apparently the Boulevard pool closed at 3:00, both Friday & Saturday of our stay, for a concert. Strange! We took a staff person's recommendation and ate at Scarpetta one night. HORRIBLE service, just too slow. Our food was good, though. We also enjoyed Holstein's & The coffee shop. Around 11:00, Friday night, we decided to try our luck & go in to The Marquee. Since we were guests & the lines weren't awful, we got in for free. After 20 minutes of small lines, elevators, we made it in. Wow, I know I'm 40, but it was dark, LOUD, & the constant strobe light was rough. Clearly an incredible draw for those in their 20's, but not for us. Strangest exit to a Club I've ever seen. You are sent through back hallways, then down 2-3 flights of metal stairs. Rough for those who've partied all night long, I bet. Would I go back - absolutely.

Our room was on the 44th floor (quite high) and we had a terrace room. The room was out of this world, so much it was close to being a small apartment. To start with the bathroom, it was spacious, with a double sink unit, a jacuzzi bath, and seperate shower which was large enough to have a party in. There is also a toilet seperated in a room of its own. The bedroom had two massive beds, both facing a large HD flat television mounted onto the wall. This was followed by a small kitchen area against the wall, with fridge, dishwasher and microwave. There was a small living area, with a sofa, table and chair facing a desk with another large flat television above it. This led out to the terrace (our view overlooking the Aria, New York New York, Luxor etc) which had a chair and footrest on it. You can pay more to be on the side of the hotel which overlooks the Bellagio, however I did not want the music and roar of the fountains through the night, so the side we were on did not bother me. The room featured a large almost walk in wardrobe which has a safe, also with ironing board etc. One word of warning, we did not touch the very nice white dressing gowns in the wardrobe, as to take home would cost a mere $128 each!! The temperature, lights, alarm etc could all be controled by the touchscreen telephone on the bedside cabinet or through the interactive menus on the televisions. Another good feature we found with the telephone was the Beck and Call option, which simply pushing would put you through to a member of staff who would see to your every need. We used this several times during our stay. The room was so amazing, we couldn't get over how nice and big it was, we almost didn't want to leave it, despite Las Vegas being outside. We had breakfast included which is provided in the Wicked Spoon restaurant. Queues can get long but you are seated quite quickly. This buffet provides a wide choice of hot and cold foods of which you help yourself to. There are two pool decks and of course the usual casino and shopping areas within the hotel. I very much enjoyed my stay in this hotel and I think until something better comes along, this will be my accomodation choice next time I go to Las Vegas.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Falmouth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLuxury, with great views!\u201d", "Author": "woodcw2000", "ReviewID": "UR118563594", "Content": "Loved our stay in this hotel.

We were going to be staying at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. I started reading reviews and thought, there is NO WAY I am going to stay there! We are 47 / 49 years old, and I did not want to spend my vacation with the \"Clubbing Crowd\". My husband suggested we just try it, if it's that bad we will go somewhere else. (Just for reference, we usually stay at the Wynn or Bellagio) We arrived on Sat. morning after an all night flight from Hawaii. From the moment we arrived, the Bellman greeted us warmly and escorted us to the front desk. There we were met by a lovely young lady who couldn't do enough to make sure we would have the best vacation. We were able to get into our room a little afternoon, good for us because we were tired. Our room was FANTASTIC! East Tower, high floor, overlooking the Bellagio fountains. WARNING!!! The East Tower is right over the Marquee Nightclub....yes, you do hear the boom-boom music all night long. We heard it Sat. night, Sun and Monday. We left our bathroom fan on, and brought our own small \"white noise\" machine, so the noise didn't phase us. I heard the West Tower doesn't have as a bad a problem with the club noise. Our room was a 1 bedroom, terrace suite. The bed is sooo comfortable! The soaking tub was neat, it overlooked the strip! The best part was the outdoor balcony. We were able to enjoy a glass of wine in the evening and watch the fountains at the Berllagio, a real treat. The room was cleaned daily, and all of the shampoos, etc were re-stocked every day....no need to bring your own. You won't be able to put anything in th fridge in your room, it is stocked wiht their stuff and if you move any of it you will be charged. No coffee maker, but there is a great coffee shop on the 2nd floor. FOOD??? The Wicked Spoon was delicious! My husband seemed to only eat the chocolate covered strawberries, but I made sure I tried a bit of everything. I voted the Lunch buffet as the best meal. Two other places to try, the \"Hidden Pizza\" place, on the 3rd floor. Great New York style pizza. Also, Holsteins Burger and Shakes...stand by for big burgers (we split ours after seeing one!) very yummy. If your looking for a nice place to sit and have a cocktail, go to \"The Henry\". If you like Bloody Mary's, you're in for a treat. Roasted Garlic Vodka, basil, balsamic reduction...sounds weird I know but yowza it was good! POOLS: Only 1 was open. It seems the Bamboo Pool closed for the season (HUH?? it's still 100* out, what season, less hot??) So everyone was crammed into the Boullivard pool. Luckily was had asked about the poolside lounges and found out that during the week you can rent one for 100, but 50 of that goes toward a food and drink credit, so at least I had a guaranteed 2 lounges and an umbrella. Otherwise, get down there NLT 9:00 to pick a seat. Now, I must warn you again......if you even feel the slightest bit \"jiggly\", have a cocktail before you go because everyone at the pool is pretty! NO fat, NO stretch marks, more extentsions than a wig factory....(me, I am a 47 year old mother of two, that's 100% original...I enjoyed just watching the show!!) People were friendly, and it wasn't crazy...just crowded. Overall, this was one of the better vacations I've had. The location of the Cosmo was PERFECT. we were able to walk to everything.

Did not go to the Mastros in Crystals on this trip so I can only speak for the one in Beverly Hills. The theme for most restaurants in Vegas is offering small portions at high prices.

We stayed there from August 16-23, 2011. When we first arrived, we were a bit nervous about getting the best room for our money. We love the strip view and really wanted to have a nice room! We were excited about the terraces. When we checked in we had Ryan from the front desk. Ryan was awesome! He told us to trust him that he would find us a great room. We had booked a terrace studio and I thought I really wanted the east tower. Ryan gave us a Terrace One Bedroom for no extra charge and we were in the west tower. Our room was awesome! The view was of the Bellagio and the strip! We could watch the Bellagio fountains all night. We really enjoyed the size of the The Cosmopolitan and it is easy to get around in. It doesn't take long to find where you are going and how to get back. We stayed for one week (Tues to Tues) and Tues-Thurs was fabulous but it started to get REAL busy and crowded on Friday through to Sunday. We had the place to ourselves again on the following Monday and Tuesday. After all this is Vegas but I really didn't like the crowds everywhere! The Wicked Spoon is a GREAT buffet and my husband and I do not like buffets. But this was amazing and we went there 3 times during our stay. You must try it! It is fabulous! We also had a Chai Tea latte from the coffee place and it was good. We ate at the Henri one evening but I believe it was Friday night and it was so noisy (you're right in the middle of the casino) we couldn't even talk with each other or our friends. Food was good, though. We loved the Chandelier bar and had a great \"cosmopolitan\" there! Go figure! We also found the \"secret pizza place\" and the pizza was very good. Try it out if you need a quick snack. The one place I would suggest you avoid is the STK restaurant. My friends and I had a reservation there since May (and this was August). When we went in (Sunday night so again crazy noisy), it was more like a bar setting which we don't mind but you couldn't even talk to each other. Our reservation was at 8:15 and they kept putting us off. By 9:00 we saw them sit other people that we knew had just walked in and then told us it might be another 45 minutes or so! I talked to the manager who didn't really seem to care that we had a reservation and so we left. They were VERY rude to us! We went to the concierge downstairs by the front desk and one of the gals there (I think her name was Natalie?) phoned over to the Crystals (next door) and got us a reservation at Mastro's Ocean Club. It was about 10:00 PM by this time and we were starving! They were so great there and the food was to die for! Loved it! Thanks to the Cosmo concierge for recommending it and looking after us! We also booked a cabana one morning and it was great. A bit pricey but we enjoyed our day and drink and ate by the pool all day long. We had the cabana until 7:00 PM that night. Drinks were a bit pricey but we expected that. There were 3 couples so it's not so bad if you share the cost.

Check-in was swift, even though it was the evening of the big Mayweather/Ortiz fight so we did expect there to be lines judging by some of the previous comments. We were offered an upgrade for $150 to a terrace suite overlooking the Bellagio but to be honest, we've been to Vegas a few times and so the fountains dont really excite us, and we were more concerned with getting a room away from the club so that noise wasnt an issue. Our room on the 49th floor of the West Tower was superb, quiet and spotless. The maid serviced our room every day whilst we were out and the Beck and Call Service was helpful and prompt. We did note though, that there is a huge difference between the hotel in the week from that on weekends. Its definitely a party hotel. On Friday, you see the influx of the Jersey Shore (or The Only Way is Essex (for us Brits) ) twenty-somethings wearing next to nothing who take over the hotel looking for a good time. Didnt really bother us - each to their own, but if this is not your thing then maybe avoid the weekends as its very busy and loud (how old do I sound writing this?? - I need to get a life!!!). Went to Wicked Spoon buffet. Plenty of choice - could have been a bit warmer though. The Wynn buffet still the best on the strip for me. Also, Holsteins do great milk shakes.

We have previously stayed in The Luxor, Monte Carlo, MGM Grand, Bellagio, Venetian and the Palazzo. This year we decided to opt for 7 nights in the Cosmopolitan and booked a Terrace Suite that included a daily complimentary brunch at the Wicked Spoon. We arrived at check in armed with information from all the previous reviews of this hotel and asked for a quiet west tower room, on a high floor with a view of the fountains. Unfortunately this was not available over our 7-night duration so we were offered a fantastic free upgrade to a wrap around suite in the east tower. We have stayed in some incredible rooms in Las Vegas but this really was an amazing room (worth around $6000 over our stay). Our thoughts on this hotel: Check in/out \u2013 No real issues with all accidental mini bar charges removed. Noise levels \u2013 We had a wrap around suite in the east tower (22nd floor) with aspects to the east (strip) and south (city centre). Best strip view we have ever had. We experienced some late night noise that seem to originate from the Rock Bar at Planet Hollywood. The room was also subject to traffic noise from the Strip. We were not bothered too much by this noise and were not affected by the Marquee club. Pools \u2013 We tried out both pools and found the Bamboo pool to be too sedate so we ended up using the Boulevard pool all the time. Being on UK time we were always early risers and never had a problem getting a prime position lounger. I would rate the pool experience at the Cosmo very highly. Wicked Spoon \u2013 We had a daily brunch included in our room rate. The Wicked Spoon has one of the most comprehensive Vegas buffets I have ever seen although I would probably not have paid the going rate for it. Housekeeping - Never had any issues. As a tip, when you leave your room for the day, hang up the \u201cclean please\u201d sign. Never failed us. Room Technology \u2013 Room was full of gadgets although very gimmicky. Why would you go through 5 menus on the TV to turn down the AC or turn off a light when you can simply hit a single switch? Had an issue with the TV which turned itself on in the middle of the night\u2026..very spooky!!!!.

I could play that for hours. The pool in the east tower was awesome too. We went only one morning, around 10 and found 2 chairs next to the pool open. I'm guessing if we got there any later we would have to lay further away from the pool, but there seemed to be plenty of chairs around.

We called housekeeping before we left our room for dinner to request two additional hand towels; when we came back, we found two extra facecloths and two extra boxes of Kleenex. We called housekeeping to inform them of the mistake and only got a response from them some two hours later, after a second call to tweak them.

The cold water faucet in the bathroom turned on opposite the conventional direction. As for the shower being separated from the bedroom by a glass wall with a curtain, we conjectured that while perhaps this had been done with a naughty wink, it was more likely designed primarily as a conversation piece. There was an ironing in board in the room but no iron. There was almost no storage room (e.g. drawers) for our clothes. There were 6 pillows on each bed and virtually nowhere to put them when we were ready to go to sleep. There was a very large, high quality TV in the room but each night we watched it, the picture broke up and then went dark a number of times mid-program.

We arrived ( 2 couples) around 6.30pm Saturday evening and had booked City Rooms but had emailed in advance asking for West Tower rooms as we had read about the noise from the Marquee Nightclub.We waited no more than 5 mins to be served and were told that no West Tower rooms were available as the Hotel was full but we were instantly upgraded to a Terraced Suite in the East Tower on the 35 th Floor and asked to come back the following evening to see if there were any West Tower rooms. We did that the following night and again were given Terraced Suites in the West Tower on the 48th & 50th floors overlooking The Bellagio fountains and The Strip - the rooms were stunning and having stayed in Vegas before the view was amazing from our huge balcony. The room was very impressive and full of mod-cons and kept very clean and all staff throughout the Hotel could not have been more helpful.

We used the Boulevard & Bamboo Pool which both closed at 6pm which we thought was strange as there was another hour of daylight left - we did not venture to the Marquee Pool as in our early 50's we left it to the young ones and there were plenty of them which I think the Hotel has been set up for.It certainly did not spoil our holiday and will definitely stay again when we come back to Vegas", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel overall!\u201d", "Author": "foodieforlife333", "ReviewID": "UR118449561", "Content": "I travel to Las Vegas quite frequently for business.

Did not order room service, but had friendly encounters with the staff I encountered. Check out the \"secret\" pizza place on the 3rd floor by the pool table, best pizza in Vegas. Details on yelp. The only negative experience I had was while trying to sleep. There was practically no air circulation and the room got hot at night, despite several attempts to put the thermostat at the lowest it will go (65 F). I believe that this is partially caused by their \"Sustainability\" policy which apparently includes some kind of a motion sensor thermostat. It seemed to switch completely off if no one was in the room, which ment returning to a hot room and sweaty nights. I had to purchase a small fan and sleep with it pointed at me while I slept. Since it was a one bedroom suite it had a living area and a bedroom area. There was a vent in the bedroom, but even with the thermostat set to high there was barely anything at all. The main output was clear on the other side of the considerably large room in the living area. This area would get quite cold while the bedroom stayed sweaty.

We definitely suggest booking a terrace room overlooking the Bellagio fountains. We had a terrace one-bedroom - a wonderful room with superb TV-regulated room features, great soaking tub overlooking the view, large closets, living room, small kitchenette. Internet was complimentary, a great feature for folks who have to work while trying to vacation. Rumors have it they are changing to a $15 per day fee for internet - hopefully these rumors are false because that price is outrageous and the current free internet separates the property from others in the city. Negatives of the room: should have a coffee/tea maker; fridge offers no room for personal items and the electronic touch sensors charged us everytime we tried to put a soft drink of our own in; housekeeping is not the best - used washcloths not removed, wastebasket not emptied, terrace had cigarette butts on it, desk drawer had someone's betting slips in it. The location of the hotel is excellent - center strip, easy to get to many great hotels, restaurants and shopping. If you want a location near City Center, this hotel beats Aria and Vdara hands down. There are two towers, east and west. Staying in one results in long walks to the other. In order to get from our room in the east tower to the Bamboo pool, we had to go down to the 3rd level, walk through the restaurant area, all the way through the conference center and then up to what they call the 14th floor. Floor numbers are rather strange in that the Bamboo Pool on the 14th floor of the west tower is actually at the same height as the Boulevard Pool on the 4th floor of the east tower. This is not a problem, just strange! The Bamboo pool is superb. Lots of seating, fairly quiet, comfy lounge chairs, good bar service. More active people would love the Boulevard Pool, which overlooks the strip and is also very well laid-out and beautiful. We didn't try the Marquee Pool. The restaurants we tried were excellent. Food and service top notch. Try to secret pizza place for take out...great pizza. The bar service in Bond was also excellent. Drinks are not cheap but that comes with the type of property it is. Parking in the underground garage was never a problem. All the parking spots are marked by either a green or red light to tell drivers which spots are open. This is an EXCELLENT time-saving feature. Make sure you park in the section under the tower your room is in. The Cosmopolitan staff was superb. Everyone was outgoing, friendly, helpful. When we couldn't find a location we were looking for, an employee at the buffet left the restaurant and walked us all the way through the hotel until we arrived right at our destination. The hotel accepts pets, which is not to our liking. They should have rooms set aside for pet owners. Dogs carry fleas, and I don't think the hotel housekeeping is up to the task of keeping the rooms flea-free. We've stayed in many, many Vegas hotels. The Cosmopolitan may end up being our new go-to hotel. With improvements in housekeeping (should be an easy fix - and when we called down, our room was thoroughly cleaned the following day), keeping the free internet, and adding a coffee maker to each room, we would definitely put this hotel at the top of our list for a reasonably-priced, unique spot in Vegas.", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel, NO housekeeping\u201d", "Author": "FrequentTraveler623", "ReviewID": "UR118210558", "Content": "Hotel is gorgeous and staff friendly and attentive.

The tv controls didn't affect it, nor did the switch. I finally draped a towel over it. One day I left the room at 6 am one morning to return at 6:30 PM to an unmade room. 12 \u00bd hours? I had to request that my room be made up\u2026 totally inexcusable. Additionally, there was no consistency in supplies added to the room. One day a toothbrush, another day a pen. The Cosmo needs to learn that it\u2019s consistency that brings people back. While I was there, a group from Deutsche Bank also was meeting. Since they own the Cosmo, it will be interesting if their experiences were similar. Although I would not return to the Cosmo, there were some VERY positive things about it... It is drop dead gorgeous and the location can\u2019t be beat. The bed and linens were FABULOUS. It's a hotel for pretty young rich people. All others go next door to the Bellagio. It is not a maze like other Vegas properties. The conference food and The Wicked Spoon buffet were amazing. The rain shower head was wonderful. The front desk did warn that the honor bar is on sensors and that I would be immediately charged if I even looked at anything. Lots of pretty people to look at.

I can't say enough good things about the facilities. The rooms are stunning. The selection of restaurants are fantastic. But there are a few things about this property that keep it from getting a 5 Star Rating. I checked in on Monday and was given a room on a high floor in the East Tower. I'm here on business, so it was not a late gambling night. I was in bed by 10...but was awoken by the thumping of the Marquee night club at 11:20. The night club (it's a night/day club....with a pool...don't ask) was some 30 floors down...but because it's around this whole pool deck, the noise is everywhere. Honestly, hundreds of rooms must have heard the same level of noise that I did. It's crazy...not all of us are 20-something nightclub goers.....and did I mention that it was a MONDAY! When I called the front desk, the response was \"they rent the space from us, there's nothing we can do about it.\" My reply was \"I rent this space from you, and I expect a quiet night's sleep.\" The manager arranged to move me to another room. Unfortunately, it was in the West Tower which is a hike. Definitely NOT FUN to pack up your stuff at 11:30 at night and move. But the room they moved me to had a stunning view of the Bellagio fountains. It was a great room (very similar to the view/room I had on my previous visit). Again, kudos on the stunning rooms. The attitude of the staff (those handling my room change) and others however, needs improvement. Have you been to the pools? Be prepared for a LOT of attitude from the servers there. It's almost like you're supposed to feel priviledged to be there. No...sorry...I'm not renting a $500 cabana, but I still want a drink, and you can stop rolling your eyes. This was at the pool overlooking the strip. I would have gone to the pool in the West Tower, but they closed it due to rain. And did I mention that it WAS NOT raining? When I brought this issue up to the front desk, I was greeted with.......more ATTITUDE! Hey folks....stow the attitude and make a concerted effort to be a bit more gracious to your guests. And find a way to stifle the noise at that crappy club. I can't imagine the volume of calls that come in nightly complaining about that. Will I stay here again? Probably...because it's a great property.

All the bartenders were friendly, generous with the \"freebies\" and all seemed to enjoy a good conversation. The food was great. The buffet at Wicked Spoon....TOO good. actually, WAY too good.

Enhanced women in very fitted clothing...everywhere....kept wondering if my husband actually would break his neck. ..... the negatives. Our suite ...(which we had specifically mentioned would be used for a pre-show cocktail for 6+..... had ONE chair. It had two HUGE bathrooms and a kitchenette...and a lovely terrace with ONE chair. Odd that while the kitchenette did have a dishwasher, it did not come with dishes, or glasses or silverware...... But what was truly odd was that with all this square footage (with two big tv's) there was no couch. A bed..and ONE chair in 700 square feet? So....I scanned the internet photos of our room \"type\"...they ALL have a couch. I called front desk and housekeeping and was told engineering would be in to investigate. \"You don't need an engineer to see that a large amount of seating is not here.\" Well....we went out for the day...came back to nothing changed. We went out for the entire evening, expecting a couch at our return but again, had nothing. I got up the next morning , worried about our pre-show cocktail party and having no place for anyone to sit. We went out for the entire day....came back to prepare for our incoming guests and still no couch. I was now on my third call to report the problem but time was running out for our planned get together so we cancelled the whole thing and made plans to meet up in a bar instead. (reason for the upgraded room WAS to host this cocktail party) ugh.... Finally, I was told they were \"out\" of couches and that we had to change rooms. This made my husband furious as we already had to change our plans, but we still had another day there and I wanted a room WITH furniture. We did get quite a lovely upgrade a few doors down and now had not one, but two couches and a table in the space where we previously had zero. Odd again....this time, the kitchenette was a full kitchen with a stove, oven, full fridge and bar tools...but no glasses, no silverware. How does this work? One more complaint..... the phones. Ugh Ugh and ick. Room to room was horrible. (how do you get lines \"dropping\" when only calling a floor away? They should fix that! At check-out....I mentioned that while the upgrade was lovely, I still felt that a guest shouldn't have to report that an entire living room is missing furniture. The housecleaner SHOULD have noticed it...(however, she didn't notice the garbage under the sink hadn't been emptied in days either....)

The hotel is absolutely gorgeous, its the newest one on the strip. The taxi driver told us that it was the most expensive in terms of how much it took to build the hotel. The drive was only about 10 minutes from the airport and about a $12 cab ride. The hotel is next door to the Bellagio. Our check-in agent (Angel) was sooooo polite and helpful. Really loved her attitude. She convinced us to upgrade to the terrace suite and since it was my birthday, she gave us a discount. She gave us the quite (east) tower. The other tower is above the pool/club area so it gets loud there at night. I was so thankful for this tip! The terrace turned out to be a GREAT idea. We were able to watch the Bellagio water show every night from our terrace, perfect end to the evening. Angel made sure that the Bellagio sign wasn't blocking our view, there are some rooms that get blocked from the sign. Would definitely upgrade again. The room had a funky, modern vibe. There was a little kitchen, desk and lounge area, huge closet, huge two sink bathroom with a sinking tub. The toilet was in a separate room and got quite hot in there, thats the only weird part of the room. The casino was so modern and lounge type of feel. The chandelier bar in the middle of the casino goes up about 3 floors, its awesome! There was a mix of ages there, but mostly 20-50s age group. We ate at Scarpetta where you can also see the Bellagio water show from a window table (highly recommend reserving a table in advance by the window). Scarpetta's spaghetti was the best spaghetti I've ever had. We also had the special of the night, rib eye, was so delicious! We also ate at D.O.C.G next door to Scarpetta. It was just alright for the price. The caramel pudding dessert was amazing. The service at Scarpetta was perfect, but the service at D.O.C.G was really bad. Our waiter at D.O.C.G didn't pay any attention to our table and maybe thats why we didn't really care for our food either. We also ate at Blue Ribbon, a more traditional style of Japanese food, good but very pricey. We tried the China Poblanos for a small snack. The tacos were delicious. We also went into the secret pizza joint next to Blue Ribbon for a late night snack. I'm from NY, so the pizza was just alright... but a god send for a late night craving! We had a late brunch at the Witherspoon buffet. They had REALLY amazing choices. They had everything you can think of! Suggestion: save room for their gelato for dessert. The pistachio one is to die for! The Henry restaurant was a bit overpriced for what it was, I'd rather go to Witherspoon for a brunch than the Henry. BUT I loved their tater tots at the Henry, they had truffle salt on them, so delic. Overall, I absolutely loved this hotel. Can't wait to come back again. I'm not much of a gambler, drinker or a person who likes shows, but I can totally picture myself coming back to Las Vegas just to stay at this hotel and eat. There were plenty of other restaurants that I didn't get to try! (although it seems like all I did was eat, haha) The hotel itself was running a deal, buy 3 nights get the 4th free on their website.

I thought that was a bit of unnecessary price gauging.) We were on the 57th floor. There are more than 70 floors in this hotel. We stayed on the side of the building that faced the hotel's night club and day spa. Warning: The \"thump-thump\" music starts at 10:30 AM and continues until 4AM. If you are on the side of the building facing club (the east side?), tell the front desk that you immediately want to be in a different room. Don't even bother going upstairs - get the room changed while you are still at the front desk. Some things to take into account at this hotel -- (1) The hotel authorizes your credit card for $150 per day for your visit (even if you have paid all room charges in advance), and the hotel does not change that policy. There are no daily refunds given for the credit authorization. For my entire stay, the hotel tied up over $1000 on my credit card. (2) Make sure you check your bill frequently for this hotel. If you pre-pay your room (like through a travel agent, expedia, orbitz, travelocity, etc.), the hotel will attempt to rebill you for the nightly room cost. The front desk did that every night of my stay, and it had to be fixed every single day. (This required 15-20 minutes on the hotel every day. Make certain that you keep your pre-paid receipt from your travel provider since you will need it every time there is a problem.) (3) Room service and housekeeping are completely different departments, and one does not know what the other one is doing. If you have ordered room service, you have to call room service to come and take the tray away: housekeeping wil not move it. You can't just leave the tray in the hallway or it will sit there all day and night. On every occasion where we had a tray in the room, we had to carry/wheel the tray over to the \"staff room\" on the floor so that it would finally be taken away. (4) The casino in the hotel is non-descript. It felt like it was an add-on. I can't give an exact reason, but I felt uncomfortable gambling in this casino. (5) There are plenty of restaurants in this hotel, but no real night-life (other than the night club with the \"thump-thump music). (6) This hotel caters to a \"hip, young crowd\". At 48 years old, I felt a little out-of-place. Despite the room size, I think I would have been happier at one of the more established hotels on the strip.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cTHE BEST HOTEL IN VEGAS EVER!!!\u201d", "Author": "Chicagogirl537", "ReviewID": "UR117950944", "Content": "We stayed here with 10 friends for a vow renewal. I was a bit apprehensive due to the reviews I saw on Tripadvisor but took a gamble because it's the only hotel in Vegas with balconies. We ended up upgrading to the wrap around suite which was AMAZING. It's the best room we've ever stayed in and right in the heart of the Strip. We breezed right through check in and Sara was the best check in host ever. She offered us the upgrade right away and took the time to connect the reservations for everyone in our group so we were all on the same floor. We got into our room right away. The room was basically like a one bedroom apartment. It had a full kitchen, a living and dining area, a guest bathroom with full shower and a separate bedroom with a shower, huge tub and enclosed bathroom so someone can go #1 and #2 while the other person is showering. We had a view facing the Bellagio so we could see the water show and hear the music. The best thing about this corner of the hotel (in the eastside tower) was that one part of the balcony was shaded all the time and the other side of the balcony got sun. I saw someone commented that you pay to go to the pool which isn't entirely true. One of the days we got a cabana at the Marquee club which is a charge but the second day we went to the Boulevard pool and sat on chairs on the second level for no charge. It is true that at the Boulevard pool you have to pay for the large couches right on the pool but there are areas that you can sit in with no charge like any other pool. Go to the Marquee if you want a party atmosphere and the Boulevard if you want to chill out. We ate at Blue Ribbon one night and the sushi was excellent, try the beef tongue. It doesn't sound like most people's #1 choice but it is to die for. The casino is fun like any other but they do a good job of getting the smoke out of there and the cocktail waitresses come around quite often. The only constructive criticism I have is of housekeeping. I've read this a lot on tripadvisor and we had similar types of experiences. I'm not sure what the issue was but when we checked in we didn't have bath slippers and our mini bar and snack bar hadn't been refilled. I called down right away because I didn't want to get charged. We also got back to our room one day at 2pm and housekeeping hadn't been there yet so we just bypassed it that day since we were having people over at 4:30pm and didn't have time for them to clean our room. Our friends also had an issue with broken glass in their room when they checked in and it took housekeeping over an hour to get in there to clean it up, they also had no bath slippers. Basically make sure to check that you have everything in place that you could be charged for. However, I will definitely stay here again!!!", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cVery Jersey Shore type guests.

This is what I mean. The Staff at the chek-in counter were happy, accommodating and very presentable. Security was very efficient and polite. The wait staff at each restaurant/bar was terrific. The house keeping staff on the other hand was awful. My room still had garbage on the floor from the guests before. The bed had impressions on it like someone had been laying on it. The toiletries had not been replaced, no shampoo or soap. After having a meeting in my room I called house keeping to get it re-made. The person on the line said someone would be right there. 4 hours later no one had arrived. I had a conversation with a bellhop and had commented about the dirty room to him. His response once that in the future I should book not on the lower floors, anything below 30th. He told me that those rooms are the cheap rooms and not the priority of the hotel. Luckily I did not pay for my room, but have learned that my company paid $500/night, these should not be low priority. That been said my room 2736 had cigarette burns allover the floor. The hotel has not been open a year yet. Shame on them. All in All, there is a huge up side to stay at the Cosmopolitan. It has an amazing vibe and hipness I have never seen in Vegas.

We were there from July 28th-Aug 1, 2011. We arrived in the morning (about 10:00) and there was no wait to check in, amazingly our room was ready and our bags were delivered right away. The hotel was sold out so I heard that check in and especially baggage delivery was taking much longer in the afternoon so you might want to keep that in mind. The staff here is really awesome. Everyone is so warm and friendly. From the valet and bellmen, to the front desk staff, to the maintenance people you meet in the hall, to the waitresses and dealers in the casinos they all have a big smile and friendly hello for you. There is lots of staff in the hotel and you\u2019re never too far from someone that can help with directions. The rooms are very, very nice. We upgraded to a premium view room with view of the Bellagio fountains and it is spectacular! I thought the fountain view was better from the 26 floor than from 36 or higher, better pictures. First we were in a King Studio Suite but we were attending a wedding and were going to have people up to our room. We wanted to be able to close off the bedroom so we updated to King One Bedroom Suite. Both rooms were great, you can\u2019t go wrong with either one. The hotel is brand new with very comfortable bed including down pillows and comforter. The bathrooms in the two rooms are slightly different configurations but both are nice. There could be a little more storage space for clothes. There are a couple of shelves in the closet some very small draws in the desk and a large draw under the kitchenette sink but not really enough for two people. The technology in the hotels is amazing, state-of-the-art. Everything in the room can be controlled on the TV, the A/C, lights, folio, alarms, music. Even includes room service menu (but you can\u2019t order here) and hotel restaurants (although I wish their menus would have been available but can make reservations). My only real compliant is the remotes are very slows there\u2019s a lot of lag time in the system and the are weak so you have to be pretty close and point them just so. It can be frustrating trying to do your navigating. One neat feature is \u2018Hello\u2019 and \u2018Goodbye\u2019 buttons by the door that turns on and off all the lights when you come and go. Very handy and great for coming home a night to dark room. BEWARE of the kitchenette. Room descriptions say: A meticulously designed kitchenette holds your very own microwave and Sub-Zero mini-bar stocked with unexpected treats \u2013 amenities not found in your typical Las Vegas luxury hotel room. One the Southwest Vacations site they call it a Sub-Zero refrigerator. This is true and the kitchenette is very nice and a main reason we picked The Cosmo but there are a few issues. First there are no kitchen accessories other than paper towels; no dishes, no silverware, nothing! Although there\u2019s lots of cabinet space to store stuff. We called room service to ask for two place settings and were told it would be $25 to deliver more than 5 items. They did deliver the settings but we were not charged. My biggest complaint was about the \u2018sub-zero mini bar\u2019. Since room had a kitchenette we had come refrigerated items and I also have some medications that must be refrigerate. We move the min-bar items around but knew we would be charged for them. We called the front desk and were told they would charge us $25 to empty the mini-bar. Later we talked to a very nice manager at the front desk and he just told us to remove the mini-bar items and replacement when we left and let them know what we used. I was very happy with this arrangement but when we returned to our room the mini-bar had be \u2018restocked\u2019 and all of our items removed and set out including my meds. I was not a happy camper. There was a note on our account about the min-bar and there were no big hassle and all the charges were removed from our bill. The valet parking is really awesome. Drop off is simple and pick up great! There a room downstairs where you scan you valet ticket and there\u2019s a air conditions sitting area with glass front so you can see when your car arrives. No standing in the sun and heat waiting for your car! There was a note on our account about the min-bar and there were no hassle and all the charges were removed from our bill. We had a $25 per day food credit and there was no problem with getting the credit but it took them 15 minutes to figure out how to apply it to our bill.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario, California", "Title": "\u201cTHE CrAzY CRacKEN COSMO!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "cam d", "ReviewID": "UR117909590", "Content": "THE \"IT\" SPOT FOR ANYONE 21-39!!!!!!!

We stayed there during the week to avoid long queues and it worked.

Shut the glass door and couldn't hear a thing. It's quite warm so make sure you turn the air con fan on high the whole time. Everythings high tech we had two TVs in our room, both can control the lights and the air con. The whole hotels got LED screens through out.

Even if you don't stay here you still have to come in and have a look at the decoration. The Chandelier bar is my fav!! Having said that, didn't eat or drink at the hotel cos it's bloody expensive! Except the Wicked Spoon buffet which was very reasonably priced and the food was great - mountains of prawns and crab legs! The location was great. We had dinner across the road at the Rock Bar most of the time which had great atmosphere and was cheap-ish. Buy your water and chocolate etc at the ABC Store in the Miracle Mall.

Loved the decor, finishes and location. THE BAD The NOISE: I know its Vegas... not a place for R&R, but I personally think I should be able to sleep in peace being that the rooms are so damn expensive in this hotel! At check in we should have been warned of the noise level produced by the DayClub below. We were on the 60-something floor and still heard the loud fist-pumping tunes clearly. The hotel does have quiet rooms that are facing the Bellagio Fountains. Those should have been offered to us. Instead we had to raise hell and demand them after enduring hours of noise all night. We weren't even told about the option to change rooms until the 4th phone call we made to the front desk about the noise. Instead... they offered us EARPLUGS! Are you kidding me?!!! That's just pissed me off. I'm not saying they shouldn't have offered earplugs... I'm saying that should not have been our only option. It wasn't until my 2nd conversation with a manager that we got switched out of our room. The SERVICE: Ok. They're new I get it... Communication between departments is terrible. One crew says one thing and the other says another. One thing they all agree on is the club Marquee is at the center of about 80% of the issues that people have with the hotel. The noise & the type of people it attracts etc... I even witnessed (and almost got run over by) someone getting chased (on foot in the hotel) by 3 security guards... looked like the guy had stolen a purse. The PEOPLE: The guests are not as fabulous as the ambiance. Get ready for a predominantly Jersey Shore-ish type of crowd. Great if you're into that thing... but the hotel's advertisements led me to believe that it was a chic and haute fashion place. The hotel is filled with young, fun and loud people in their twenty-somethings. You'll see more silicone than most places on the strip. Drinks were weak... Don't order a mohito at the \"fun\" pool... they're awful! ____________________________________ THE GOOD (well... kind of) The LOCATION: Is stellar. Its connected or part of center city which is a high-end lux shopping and dining area with Crystal's at the heart of it. Louis Vuitton, Tom Ford, Gucci and most of the other high end fashion brands are there. The ARCHITECTURE & DECOR: A+ all around. Seems like no expense was spared, except behind the reception desk surprisingly. Usually the reception area is where designers put their best. Not sure what happened there. Other than that... I love the design and decoration. Great use of color throughout, create furniture and finishes. The POOLS: There are 3 pools. One is actually part of the resident club Marquee, which I found out is not owned by the hotel. They just rent the space and the hotel just keeps an eye on them. The other 2 pools are very different from each other... One is Bamboo - calm, lux, zen, grown-up and chic. The other is more fun, social and young. There is a game area where you can play pool and video games on comfy couches. You'll see horny people making out all over the lounge chairs and rolling around in the shallow pool. If you're not into that sort of thing... go to Bamboo. Parking is free... that's good! Room service was fab! Needless to say, our experience was not what we expected for a 4-5 star hotel. They had to end up comping us for our stay... at least they were good enough to do that. -Great for bachelor / bachelorette partying -Terrible for romance -Terrible for R&R -Terrible if you're looking for chic, classy and grown-up crowd. -Great for people watching (lot's of hot-messes to gawk at) -Terrible for KIDS!!!

A big thumbs up to Cosmopolitan for having such a wonderful and great quality buffet... There are all breakfast items you would possibly need and lots of live stations and a heavenly dessert buffet. As it was included in the room rate, we actually had very low expectations but were utterly surprised. Even soft drinks were complimentary and service was very efficient and friendly... There were plenty of parking spots and walking distances were relatively short... The location of this hotel is also unbeatable. It is in the middle of the strip and one can easily reach many other hotels, restaurants and attractions on foot which again is a rarity in Vegas... The only problem though, as other have already mentioned, is the music coming from the pool. During our first night, there was a party and we could hear the music in the bedroom even with all windows and doors closed.

Minimum bets at the casino are a little more then a lot of the other hotels. The casino is beautiful and part of it is by the Chandelier Bar which is a massive chandelier that decorates the bar. There are a several pools at the hotel but we mainly would go to the Bamboo Pool. This pool is a little more mellow than the others, but very nice. We noticed on Thursday a lot of people come to check in of course for the weekend so it is a little more difficult to find a chair later in the afternoon. The only complaint that we have is that there was a bad smell in our room from time to time during the day that we think was coming from the plumbing in the room.

There is lots of space to put your clothes and a spacious living room area with big corner couches and a plasma tv. The bedroom area was spacious too with a huge bed and lots of pillows, the beds were very comfy. The bars in the hotel were also great the Bond bar was my personal favourite the cocktails were lovely and the general atmosphere was lively. The hotel has its own dayclub and nightclub called Marquee , We went to the day club once and had an amazing time a live DJ lots of cocktails and generally a big pool party . We went to the nightclub twice both nights were fantastic, the atmosphere is buzzing the service is outstanding and the effects suc as mermaids swimming in the lit up pool made the experience even better . There are a variety of restaurants in the Cosmopolitan, steak houses, italians sushi bars, and everyone that i visited had lovely fresh food and great service. Also on the fourh floor hidden away is a great pizza takeaway with the nicest pizza ever :) its open till 6am too. There are 3 swimming pools all of which have waitess service, we got a cobana a bit expensive but worth it for the drinks deal and a nice place to relax out of the heat . I would definately reccomend this hotel maybe to more modern lively people though not a place to stay if you want a quiet relaxing time.

Maybe a few late night cocktails. That may work just fine some months, but not in the heat of Summer. This is not the hotel's fault. I'm just cautioning others that it is not cool enough to enjoy. Being on the 57th floor was no help. The other negative is the balcony glass. It is never cleaned and the spotting is a serious detraction from the otherwise beautiful hotel. Pluses include a very friendly staff. Our room was spacious and attractive. Bar service was attentive and the drinks were top notch. Loved the atmosphere in the Chandelier Bar. There is a wide variety of dining choices; however, we chose to dine off site. Wicked Spoon Buffet dinner was the one exception. This is a matter of personal taste and not a criticism of the hotel restaurants. While waiting to check in, guests were offered free bottles of water. A nice touch. Check in was prompt and courteous. Here are a few things that need to be addressed. The lock on our door did not work. The light in the water closet was out. The stopper in the Japanese tub had to be replaced. It took two phone calls and 2hrs & 10 Min. to get our luggage delivered. No ice bucket. If you want an ice bucket, there is a $5 \"service fee\". Maid service was hit or miss. Either there was no toilet paper or towels. Glasses were never cleaned. Leave them in the sink and they would still be there after the room was cleaned. There is no scheduled time for room cleaning. Twice, after returning from many hours away, we returned to find the room had not been cleaned. This was during a six night stay. Our trip had to be extended, courtesy of Irene. While I was at the airport, trying to secure passage on a future flight, my wife was inquiring about staying in the Cosmo until we could return home. he was quted $440 for Saturday night and they would not even give her a price for the next night.

From checking into the hotel to checking out the service is excellent. I stay in a lot of hotel and you don\u2019t see the same level of service.

The room was large with a huge bathroom, including hot tube. Unfortunately didn\u2019t use the hot tube. The private terrace is really great. There is a comfy chair on each terrace. You can hear the music from the nightclubs and pools from the terrace. This could be an issue if you are on a lower floor. What I like most about the Cosmopolitan is the hotels exclusivity. A good example of the exclusivity would be pool. During my stay the pools where not crowed and there are plenty of deck chairs and cushions. Compared to other pools in Las Vegas, the Cosmopolitan trumps them all. The restaurants at the Cosmopolitan are unbelievable. I wish I had more time to try them all. I ate at the Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and grill, Holsteins and VA Bene Caffe. The sushi was excellent Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and grill. I heard the fried chicken is the best in Las Vegas. Holsteins was a good option for a yummy burger. I don\u2019t like the idea they charge for the second serving of popcorn. That should be free!! VA Bene Caffe is perfect for breakfast. Don\u2019t miss out on trying the chocolate croissant. Overall I thought the prices where reasonable. For entertainment the Cosmopolitan has some great bars and Marquee Nightclub. I also thought that Marquee nightclub was the best in Las Vegas. I recommend Monday night during the week. Last Monday night Marquee has LMFIO on stage. Marquee also provided an exclusive line for hotel residence. I didn\u2019t have to line-up and there was no cover charge. The nightclub staff also gave priority access to hotel residence. Everything from the bath soaps, shower gel to XM radio on both TVs make the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas the best hotel in Las Vegas. Everything is also still so new.

The housekeeping was rubbish (we had to send the guy back 4 times until he came back with a quilt, they had made the sofa bed up but put no quilt on it!) however this didnt bother us, we just kept sending him back until we got what we needed! The hotel pool on the 4th floor is brillant, it is over the strip and is well designed with shallow areas to lay in (it was too hot in June!), relaxing areas in the shade and tvs to watch sport. The only downside was guest would save hotels with towels at 8am and not appear until 2pm, and there were too many sunbeds which you had to pay for ($250 which is a ridiculous price), many of these remained unused whilst guests searched for a free sunbed, however again we didnt let this bother us, we just rose early and enjoyed the morning sun before it got to hot! There was also a lot of people using the pool who were not staying at the hotel! they need to monitor this better! The nightclub/ dayclub was fab! we loved marquee...the queues get huge so go early, but thats what the vegas night life is like! The restaurants are great, we liked the overlook grill and holstens burger place, and the secret pizza place! The bond bar serves great cocktails and the decor is fab! But the best thing about the hotel is the location, in the best part of the strip, next door to the bellagio! Why more vegas hotels dont have balcolnies i dont know, but that really is a selling point of the hotel!

I asked them to come and clear broken glass from terrace Monday night,sat morning was still there when we checked out! Left a polite note asking housekeeping to vacuum which again was never done,seems that all they are there to do is make beds and fold toilet roll into a point!! They provide a full kitchen,oven microwave etc, but no utensils! U get a few glasses and that's it.we complained to concierge who wanted a $200 deposit for utensils, we politely declined seeing the trouble other people have had getting their money back from here! When we upgraded the check in lady raved about the jacuzzi bath! Being on honeymoon, we thought it'd be a nice idea to have a soak with a bottle of champagne,bath was broke! Not only did bubbles not work, plug broken so couldn't fill tub. 3 calls to beck and call and 2 hours later, handyman arrives!

A light fitting in the corridor outside our room was smashed by someone and remained that way for the duration of our stay.

Checkout: Again, lengthy queues, but this time there was a gentleman in a suit going around apologising to guests for the delay.

As far as I'm concerned, we paid for 3 nights of a package and the hotel did not honour this.

We didn't, but when we went to check out and have the balance applied, it involved the front desk having to call someone to manually figure out how much was left on the card.

The concierge also assured me that the room would be thoroughly cleaned and the maintenance items taken care of. Maintenance DID respond a few hours later (replaced the mirror and fixed the sink & shower faucets) but it appeared that housekeeping made the beds but never touched the bathroom. There were at least 3 rooms on the hallway who had put their trash outside their doors - apparently they didn't get housekeeping either. Also beware: Both times I stayed, there were charges on the final bill for the spa AND the mini-bar that were incorrect. And not just a couple, LOTS of them. You can't avoid the long check-out lines because you have to get your bill straightened out before you leave the property.

Our room was very quiet. The room is very large with a sitting area and two flat screen tvs. Since the hotel is practically brand new the bathrooms and decor are very modern and clean. Also all rooms in the hotel have a nice balcony, even 40 stories up we were able to go out on the balcony and enjoy the views of the strip and mountains. The hotel has a great buffet for breakfast/brunch everyday, \"wicked spoon\" , literally every kind of food you can imagine and very fresh. We ate that everyday and went out to fine restaurants at night, bouchon at the venetian, aureole in mandalay bay, and stratta at wynn, all were superb. We also saw cirque de soleil \"O\" one night, which was very entertaining. We gambled a little at the hotel at night but definitely enjoyed all the people watching at the cosmopolitan at night. It seems all the 'beautiful people' flock to the cosmopolitan at night and it is a show. Even if you do not go to the club the casino floor is quite a spectacle. I personally do not believe this hotel, or vegas in general, is appropriate for families but there were some at the hotel. There is lots of high end shopping and great restaurants either in or right off the hotel. The hotel is also right next to the Bellagio. As a first time vegas traveller it is hard to believe how big each casino resort is. Walking from one resort to another at night is not impossible but it is a lot farther than it seems especially due to the size of each resort. Taxis are always available, but as I learned leaving the airport, there is always a huge line for taxis. I have never seen lines like these for taxis. All in all, we have no complaints. The only small bit of advise i can give the resort is to change the tip procedure in the Wicked Spoon. You pay for the buffet before you eat and they have you fill out a receipt like any other place, with tip line to be filled in. As a prior waitress, we always leave tip, even at a buffet. On the third day we were told our tips we had been writing in on the tickets did not count and we should of been leaving extra tip. I would be very surprised if anybody knew to do this since nobody clarified this to us. I really believe the waiters at the wicked spoon are being stiffed repeatedly and I hope they change this policy.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFantastic stylish place, a real must!\u201d", "Author": "Petite_Loutre", "ReviewID": "UR117553320", "Content": "Stayed in Cosmo 2 weeks ago - fantastic place, sleek, stylish, all new, shining and glamourous.

We stayed in a Strip View Terrace King Suite. The room was very spacious and well appointed. The bed was incredibly comfortable and I could have stayed in it the entire trip! Bathrooms was huge with a jacuzzi tub and very over-sized shower. There were 2 Flat Screen T.V.s, one in the living area and one in the sleeping area. The terrace was large and we had probably the best view in Vegas overlooking the Strip and the Bellagio water-show. The pool areas are nice, but have limited \"free\" seating, so that can be annoying...The Marquee Day Club is alot of fun, but plan to spend some $$$. You cannot get any seating at all without paying for a chair.. Prices start at $50 per lounge chair and go up from there depending on what you want (daybed, cabana, etc.). The good news is that the fee goes towards anything you purchase while at the Club, so your drinks, food, or anything else will be credited against the cost of your seating... The sangria pitchers were awesome, as well as the Mojito pitchers. Definitely a better value to get a pitcher vs. individual drinks.. The service at the Boulevard pool was AWFUL both days we went there. The first day our waitress was nowhere to be found when we wanted to close out our tab. We went to the bar to try and pay but they couldn't find our bill. We wanted a good 20 minuted then the bartender said we shouldn't keep waiting and just to not worry about it. The second day we ordered drinks, which never showed up and we couldn't find out waitress to find out what happened. We ended up going to the bar and ordering... My biggest issue with the room is that they have kitchenettes which are not stocked with things you would want, such as plates, silverware, ice bucket, etc. The refrigerator was stocked as a mini-bar with no room to put anything of your own. If the rooms are going to have mini-kitchens with sink/dishwasher/microwave/refrigerator/cabinet space, etc. you have to stock it with the items needed to use this stuff. With a kitchen, living room and great balcony, entertaining is something many guests will want to do and it would be nice to have these things.. We also thought the coffee bar on the 2nd floor should have a wider assortment of food for breakfast. The pastries are nice, but a larger selection of fresh fruit, oatmeal and bagels would be a nice addition. Oh, and some protein! How about hard boiled eggs for those of us who like to eat healthier??? We loved Holsteins burger and shake restaurant. Food was good, Shakes were delicious! We also recommend going to the \"unmarked\" pizza joint on the 3rd floor down the hallway next to the sushi restaurant. The place isn't listed on any of the hotel directories. It's really just a place you learn about through \"word of mouth.\" If you like thin crust NY style pizza, you should give this place a try. P.S. Highly recommend the show \"Absinthe.\" It's not a show you will see advertised and not alot of people know about it. Ask the locals though and they will RAVE about it. We went and can tell you it is AWESOME. We would see this over and over again. It's located at Caesar's Place outside in an old circus tent from the 1800's. The best way to describe the show is Cirque Du Soleil meets Rocky Horror Show. There is comedy, vulgarity, nudity, acrobatics, high wire acts, Borat style skits, etc..

Specifically, we partied at the famous \"Marquee\" day club (adult top-tional pool). The pool was beautiful, the DJ was great, the party atmosphere got really busy full of social people dancing and playing in the pool around the mid afternoon. We partied at the club until sundown. The party atmosphere was great and fun! Prices It is more expensive than all the other day clubs, possibly the most expensive. The food and drink prices are the same. You can expect to pay $14 per cocktail at pretty much all the Las Vegas pools and bars, the food probably averages about $15 per dish which is also normal in Las Vegas. But what makes The Marquee more expensive is the minimum you are required to spend on food and drinks in order to get a chair to sit on. It was a $300 minimum food/drink requirement to rent 2 chairs. This 2 - 3 times the minimum I usually pay for 2 chairs at one of these clubs. Let me tell you, for two people it is really hard to eat and drink this much. To put it in perspective, that is 6 pitchers of Mojitos...we would have been drunk and throwing up if we drank $300 worth of alcohol. There is no way we could eat $300 worth of food either (that would require us to eat about 19 plates of food). I normally pay $100-150 for two chairs at all the other day clubs, which is reasonable. I usually order enough drinks to last for about 7 hours and a couple meals. The food/drink minimum prices: $300 for 2 chairs (can only be purchased in pairs) $500 for a bed $1500 for a table If you don't purchase one of these, then you do not get any service. You have to sit on the pool side (which was actually really fun because that is where the party was at). So we just had to go to the bar to eat and drink, not a big deal. Food & Drink The bartenders were ok, they service wasn't anything to rave about and neither were the drinks. In particular, I ordered mojitos, pina coladas, and margaritas. The pina colada was not good, it tasted like the average pre-made frozen mix from a machine (I hate these). If you want an amazing pina colada, I recommend you try the \"Bare\" day club over at the \"Mirage casino\" (I will be writing a great review for this place too, and all the other Las Vegas day clubs). The mojitos were good, but I haven't ever had a bad one in Las Vegas at the pool. I always order the blackberry mojito, and its always good. The margaritas only come on the rocks - no frozen ones....this sucked because it was really hot outside, and a frozen drink would have hit the spot. The size of the drinks are super small. The size of the drinks here were the smallest drinks I have ever received at a pool for $14 (think your typical small sized plastic cup with ice in it). As for the food....I tried two types of pizzas, and an appetizer....the all sucked. The pizzas came on flat bread, tasted just like crackers (no joke), had no sauce, and little cheese. In fact, there layer of topping was so thin, I was pretty much just eating toasted flat bread. I had both the prosciutto and margherita pizza...I recommend save your money and eat something else. I saw someone eating a burger and sandwhich there, those looked better. Summary The drinks are enough to get you by, the music is great. The crowd is fun and friendly. The service sucks, even with a chair/bed there simply way too many people there, that there were not enough waitresses to keep up with the refills and orders. The prices are twice that of other day clubs. And this is the only top-optional (adult topless) pool, that there were NO topless women. The crowd here is not as fun as the ones at other clubs. The Marquee day club was a good experience, I had a fun time, but I will stick with the other the day clubs (pool club) in Las Vegas. All of the other ones have an equally awesome atmosphere, but better food, drinks, prices, and service. P.S. The public pool there is accessible from the Marquee day club, it is very nice, and has much better service and food. To get here, you have to go downstairs, but instead of taking a left back to the club entrance, go right and follow the path around to the family pool.

Stayed before at the Paris, Monte Carlo, Treasure Iland and the Bellagio. This hotel tops all others. There are a few things that could be improved. I did't like the breakfast buffet \"Wicked Spoon\". For 22 bucks it is simply not good enough. Maybe for Americans this is a great breakfast because they like ham, sausage, potatos and pizza in the mornings but I prefer bagels, rolls, croissant and jam or marmelade. I also missed cerals and fruits. So maybe this is my problem but one toaster for a huge restaurant is simply not enough. Most items were simply from the dinner buffet the day before. Such the cesars salad. The dinner buffet was great but for $75 bucks for two... not sure. We ate later at the Paris, that was more affordable and better. The room we had was a Terrace Bedroom with Premium View. We booked a Terrace Studio Premoum View trough Southwest Vacations (4 nights for a price of 3) they offered us an upgrade for $50/night that we accepted. The room was absolutely great. Large big room with kitchenette. The bathroom was also very big, walk in shower and japanese bath tub with a view to the bellagio fountains. The bed was very comfy with pillow selection. Over the TV you can turn on or off or modify your lightening, change the aircondition temperature, make reservations in the restaurants or check flights. The terrace is absolutely great. We had a room in the 30th floor of the east tower and a great view to the strip and the fountains of the Bellagio. The only con is that the balcony furniture were already spilled and should be replaced. Ours was simply turned upside down and now shpwing he zipper (bottom side up because the upper side was dirty). The other thing I am concernd is that the glasses are not maintained as they should. All glass items (bathroom door and the balkony glass) were really dirty and it looked like they were cleaned with the wrong materials. Streaks and Spots. Not good. As I mentioned I have stayed in Vegas many times and this is a great hotel, if not the best one. Their service was absolutely great. I sent weeks before we arrived a note that this is our aniversary and it was recognized when we checked in. Staff were always very friendly. Housekeeping had perfect timing. We could sleep in until 9 am and came back to the rooms sometimes around 12:30 pm and the room was already taken care off. Perfect! It was very quiet, especially in Vegas normally a big problem. The only think we heard at night were the water pipes, that could have been a bit more insulated. But we didnt hear our neighbors at all. The last thing I didnt like is the room service. We didnt order because they charge in addition to the delivery fee of $5 a 18% service fee. I believe that the gratituty should be left to the guest. I think this is a rip off, since food for the room service is already higher than normal. They also have a mini bar in the room but a regular water cost $6. I had an energy drink for $7,95. No other fridge options. The pools look great but it's not really for swimming. Just relax and sit in the shallow pools to refresh. It was too crowded for us so we didnt use it.

DO NOT stay here if you do not want to party. We stayed out most of the time, but the one night we stayed in (b/c we were leaving the next morning), the noise from the club was insane.

And note, the Cosmopolitan has a day and night club, so the party begins at the pool at noon and then goes inside til the wee hours of the morning. There were a LOT of people at the Cosmopolitan, and the majority of them were there to party. If you do not want to pass groups of guys roaming around trashed or wait forever to get a cab or eat at the \"secret\" pizza place (Is it a secret if hundreds of people are lined up for a table??

It appears if you so much as open it, touch anything inside, move anything, the sensor on each item goes off and immediately onto your bill (even though you put it right back where it was). We were celebrating a friends 45th and 50th birthdays (yeah, we were the old fogies, by comparison...but were having fun) and 4 couples ended up in our room for cocktails and laughs before we went out. As someone opened it to look inside, one of the others told us to check our bill on the TV. Sure enough, there was a $28 charge for 'mini-bar' (it was the wine...$28 for a single size glass of house wine, really?). So I looked inside and thought I was just looking, but once again, another charge. A simple call via the \"beck and call\" button on the phone and the charge was quickly removed. If you don't check your bill, you are likely to be paying for your unused mini-bar. Someone told us we could pay $25 to have the entire contents removed. We didn\u2019t see the suggestion from someone else here to have them bring you a separate fridge, that would have been a good idea. I\u2019m certain a charge would apply there also. When we tried to check out, our folio wasn't available, so not sure all the wrong charges got off, but I'm sure they will make it right. This is definitely one of the pricier hotels in Vegas, and everything is a charge (and not a small one at that) except differing from another poster, we didn't have to pay for pool lounges and we always could find 4 or 5 together. The pool cabanas are a charge and appear very nice, but again....$1,000 a day for the nicest one, really? This is definitely a \"seen and be seen\" place. We likely wouldn't return as there are so many options in Vegas, but it is definitely worth at least one check out. I'd not judge the place on the casino (again, high minimums most of the time) but definitely the rooms. They are awesome (we were told this was originally built to be used as condos and we can see why).

I try to review places/things I really enjoyed and also things I would never do again in order to warn the next person. Unfortunately- this review is going under \"things I would never do again\". Let this be your warning. The hotel itself is fabulous in terms of the ascetic and how it looks- loved how modern it was & it had a great feel. The restaurants were okay- nothing really great and nothing bad. The 3 bars I was at were awesome- got great service & the drinks were made well. I was there for the Adele concert last weekend was super excited she was playing at this hotel- seeing as it was a new hotel in Vegas & Adele is awesome. However- what I did not know was that this hotel was also having another concert the same night & from my estimation Adele was waaaaay over sold! So the outcome was an evening of absolute chaos!! The ballroom that Adele was playing was so friken hot that seriously it must have been 100 degrees in there & the amount of people crammed in was miserable! I have been to hundreds of concerts & never have I felt as claustrophobic & uncomfortable as I did this night!! There was absolutely no order to this crowd- people pushing and crammed and the heat was unbearable. Furthermore- you could not get out of the crowd- there was no isle or security to get people out - even in an emergency! Suffice to say...this hotel needs a lesson in crowd control & customer service! The night only got worse when we left the concert & had to be subjected to people just throwing up right in front of us! I'm not talking someone getting sick in a corner or bathroom...I'm talking people just totally throwing up right next to you while you are walking and no real emergency to clean it up! One girl threw up in the cab line & it just kept going for several minutes & the line had no idea what to do since it was seriously an hour line and now the pathway was all riddled with someone being sick! Again- saw no one moving in from the hotel to help with the matter. As I was walking thru the casino a guy threw a glass on the floor and again that was not a big deal apparently. I mean it was just chaotic & at one point I seriously did not feel safe. I could go on with more specifics from this experience but I will not give more of the gory details right now-considering this is turning into a novel. Basic wind up is this is a great looking, trendy hotel. However- the staff & customer service level is mostly terrible!

This is actually my first hotel review ever despite the frequent traveling I do but I felt I could put some people at ease who, like myself, was nervous going into their stay.

I'm only going to focus on the preconceived problems areas and what I found. Check-in line was about 10 minutes but it was Wednesday about noon. I noticed during our stay the lines never seemed that bad when walking through the lobby. They ever got us our room right away even though check-in isn't until 3pm.

Won't give you details about the room, everyone else has already stated how nice and modern it is. Housekeeping was great and they've clearly taken steps to improve it. We had one small hiccup. We left to go shopping and put out the \"please clean\" sign and we returned to head to the pool and the room wasn't clean. It was about 1:30 and we had a message that stated they noticed we had a Do Not Disturb out but would be happy to come and clean when it was convenient. I don't think they bothered to read which way the door hang was flipped but it was good they left a message. I was planning on calling on the way out either way. We went to the Boulevard pool a couple times and it was a little busier than we would have liked but it you're resourceful and patient you can find chaises.

Also would have been nice to have a market style place to pick up a cheese plate or something to go and there is nothing. I used the gym and they added $15 charge for the use....so keep that in mind. Fitness Center is nice and very cleaned. The fridge in mini bar has sensors and we were charged for things we did not use because we moved the items around to make room for a bottle of juice for me. It took some doing to get charges erased so FYI. The towels at pool are free of charge but pools quite small and one was closed off for weekend for a special event. Also room service can take over an hour so not great solution. The concert venue in ballroom was not great.

We had booked our room shortly after the Cosmo opened, some 7 months before our trip so we got an excellent rate. As a disclaimer this rate probably contributed to some of my positive feelings about the hotel. The public spaces at the Cosmo are absolutely fantastic. The place is glitzy and glamorous with bars everywhere you turn, and something cool around every corner. The place has more wow factor packed into it's smallish footprint then every other Vegas resort combined. The designers and builders really knocked it out of the park. Even if you don't stay here you have to visit just to check it out. The casino is a little small but it's got all the fancy new slots you could want to play. If you're looking for table games they all start at $25 in the evenings (even slower weekday evenings) but during the day you can find a few $10 tables. The casino isn't the showcase of this resort however, if you're looking for great gambling go elsewhere. The bars are where it's at here. The Vesper has the best bartenders/mixologists in Vegas working at it. Sit at the bar and tell them to make you something cool and they'll go to town on it. I had 2 drinks and fire was involved in the making of both of them! The best cocktails I've ever had. Be warned however this expertise comes at a steep price. For my wife and I to have 4 drinks it was over $60 after generous tips. We ate at the Wicked Spoon, the 'secret' pizza place, and the Henry. The Henry has good late night food, but I found the truffled tater-tots to be really over powering, if strong aromatic foods aren't your thing get the fries instead. The Wicked Spoon is a great buffet, we had brunch and they had probably the best buffet scrambled eggs I've ever seen. They Asian offerings however are the best on the buffet, the General Tso's chicken was fantastic. The secret pizza place is awesome as well. Perfect for late night snacking with crispy thin crust pizza. A tip, if there's a couple/three of you just order a whole pizza, it'll be cheaper and if you have left overs there's a microwave in your room. The only place the Cosmo lets down is in the room itself. While they're designed well and have FANTASTIC views the housekeeping and general maintenance is somewhat poor. When we first entered the room there were crumbs all over the sofa and the 'living room' area, it was clear the place hadn't been vacuumed between guests. While everything was clean on the surface if you started moving stuff around you can tell there wasn't any real attention to detail paid in the cleaning. Also, out of the 3 blinds in the room (between the shower/bath and bedroom) only 1 of them had the adjustment rod still attached, the other 2 where broken and unusable. Also the door lock/handle on the sliding door to the bedroom area was broken. None of these deficiencies were a problem, but if I was paying the weekend rate of $500/night on this room the state it was in would have been unacceptable. If they want to charge that much money they need top of the line housekeeping and it's just not there. Otherwise, our room was fantastic. The view is out of this world. As I said we were in the west tower and our room was nice and quiet. The TV is great, lots of channels all in HD. The shower is fantastic and gets nice and hot. If you like AC you can really crank it down, I think it went as far down as 60F (not that I ever lowered it past 72...I like it warmer). The service everywhere, with the exception of one waiter at the Henry that was distracted by his friends at the next table, was great. Everyone was friendly and helpful. The waiter we had at the Wicked Spoon was fantastic, and the bartenders at Vesper are, as I said, the best in Vegas. Overall the Cosmo is a home run, it's Vegas excess at it's finest. Even if you don't stay there come and check it out. Visit the bars and restaurants and other public spaces, you'll love it. Is it worth staying here? At the mid-week rate of $180/night yes, absolutely, at the weekend $500/night? No, not unless they can improve on the basics of housekeeping and maintenance.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cSo hot right now\u201d", "Author": "tew21", "ReviewID": "UR117079068", "Content": "Stayed in a terrace studio and it was more than enough room and definitely worth it (although we were using Marriott points anyways).

We double checked the phone number so we knew we gave them the correct number, but we never got a call.

Would have been nice to get the call they promised, but it's not the end of the world since we were enjoying the pool in the afternoon anyways. Word of advice, if you want access to the pools all day, make sure they don't have any big concert/events going on because they closed the Boulevard pool at 3pm that day to set up for Death Cab for Cutie playing later that night. The Bamboo pool was at capacity, so there was no getting in there either. And forget about getting into Marqee day club (not that we wanted to), it was also packed. We ate at Scarpetta one night. Had reservations so we had no problems. We got moved to a table in the window too (although I had initially requested one, they sat us at a different table first).

Police officers had to direct traffic into the hotel parking structure. After having to go 5 levels underground the heat was ridiculous down there. There were no visible stairwells so in case of emergency, people would be trapped underground. The casino was overbooked with 2 concert events. Death Cab for Cute at the pool and Adele at the Chelsea room. There was no staff to give directions and the \"Chelsea\" room is not a theater, its a Ballroom on the 4th floor. There is only one single spaced escalators going up all four levels, so everyone is forced to go by the pace of the person in front of them. The 4th floor is so inadequate for large groups of people that their is no cell service unless our have an Android. IPhone user were complaining all night. The WiFi was so bad that the merchandise stand selling Adle merchandise was limited to one handheld credit card machine, which they had to continue to reboot. None of the employees wear name badges. And I mean not one single employee in this establishment. Dealers, cocktail waitresses, you can not even identify if someone is security at his place. There is no security to check people as they come into the ballroom and the people at the door do not even look at the tickets. The front half of the ballroom was for General Admission. He other half had bleachers with small club like lounge couches at the base of the stand. There was no staff to deal with crowd control. People who wanted to leave their standing spot would push through the crowds. This happened to me on many occasions. The people around me were getting made the people pushing through were getting angry and in fights. Now everyone paid $95.00 minimum just to get into this concert. Not $20.00. It is unacceptable to cramp us together . The exits were not marked, the air conditioners were not being used enough. people complained of how hard it was to breath. these are huge signs of trouble waiting to happen. This is in no way a reflection on Adele who performed. its a reflection on the Cosmopolitan.They keep trying to buy up these big artists to make a name for their hotels and the publics safety is at risk. When the concert ended it took 20 mins to get down to the casino level. Then the parking structure only had a single pane for every vehicle to exit. So I went back up to the hotel . Then I to go to their 24hour restaurant The Henry which they advertise on the ticket stub for 25% off that evening and the place was packed. my friend had gotten picked up so I would have been a single diner, I asked the hostess if I could eat at the counter she said no, I mean she just said no I asked why, she said because they don't food serve there when its busy. I wish that I could give her name but she doesn't wear a NAME TAG!!!!!!! So after having a horrible experience I was forced to wait 2 hours walking the strip at 12am. I walked back to the Cosmopolitan then went down to the dungeon of a parking garage where I then only needed to wait 12 minutes of bumper to bumper traffic to get out of the parking lot. I will never go to another event here.

Another instance of the staff going out of their way was during our check-out.

Housekeeping could not replace the most basic of housekeeping items such as toilet paper. I had to loan my co-worker a roll of TP because housekeeping would not replace daily nor bring a roll of toilet paper when called at night. The food was awful, inedible for the most part. The special fancy dinner that we had one night for our business was the worst we've ever had. We stayed at Red Rock Resort Casino a couple years prior and their food was delectable in every single bite. Another night, we were on our own for dinner so my co-worker and I made the mistake of going to Milos. I know it is a seafood restaurant and I did order a filet mignon. I ordered it medium and it came so well done that again, it could not be eaten. The bartender noticed and got the manager. The manager offered to make it right on our next visit but that didn't help me enjoy my current experience whatsoever! There were 3 waitresses who were more interested in servicing tables with men than 2 girls as my co-worker and I were. Out of the 3 waitresses, not one of them could provide service to our table properly. They'd all ask us the same questions but no one would deliver on our answers for what we needed. When we finally received the bill for our horrendous dinner, the ditzy waitress left her ID badge with our bill. We of course turned it in but really? On a positive note, the rooms are huge and spacious. Some have nice views, others do not. The bedding was impressive and very comfortable.

Tiny selection of bar service tools. Nice two-drawer freezer and extra fridge for private items, and a separate wine fridge. Took our shoes off and within 30 minutes had black feet from the filthy carpeting--it was well vacuumed, but the carpet itself was filthy, same thing in the hallway. How often do they shampoo the carpets? We found a great deal of apparent foodfight residue on the walls and ceiling in the suite, huge globs of brown gunk, no idea how long it had been there. I called housekeeping, which sent after two hours a guy who could speak almost no English. I pointed out all the spots I saw and while we were out they half-cleaned it, with spots and brown gunk still clearly visible on the walls and ceiling. No call from the management, no visit from anyone to apologize for the lack of cleanliness in what is one of the most expensive suites in the hotel. Brown stains on the couch pillows, apparently from the same foodfight. Who does the room inspections? How often are they done? Then the washer/dryer wouldn't work. The workman came quickly, and was super-friendly, explaining the problem and getting it fixed pretty fast, but not in enough time for us to do the laundry we wanted to do. Another amenity of the suite for which we paid but could not use. No call or visit from the management to apologize, or by now, offer some sort of comp for the sorry state of the room. Was anyone even tracking or compiling the complaints from this room? Not that we could tell. 14th floor pool: nice and quiet, with some good shade.

From the wall behind the check in desks to the colums in the lobby; all plastered with display panels. These display panels showed various images and videos.

The only thing missing were pots, pans plates, and silverware. :-( A few problems I encounted was with the wooden sign that says \"do not disturb\" on one side and \"please clean room\" on the other side. That's just asking for trouble. When I left on the second day I left the sign showing \"please clean room.\" However, upon returning at 10PM the \"do not disturb\" side was showing. And yep the room wasn't cleaned. I called the front desk to get the room serviced and left to try out Wicked Spoon (the buffet at the Cosmopolitan). However upon returning only the sheets and towels were cleaned. The rest of the room was left completely untouched. Having an electronic \"do not disturb\" and \"please clean room\" sign is probably a better idea. We had breakfast in The Henry and we were not impressed. The food and service was just OK. For the same amount of money we had a lot better breakfast at MOzen Bistro (Mandarin Oriental) next door. Service isn't the hotel's strongest point, nothing special.

You do not really have a mini fridge because it is stocked with crap that if you remove you are charged( you can have everything removed for a fee). Everything was ok unitl my other guests started arriving. My mom was told their were no notes on the account and that she was not by us actually in the other tower. My mom was finally moved the day before the wedding after much hassle. My mom did get them to only charge $150 total for my guests and not per night. The rooms were a disaster. My guests were on differnet floors and all over the place. My aunt was put in a room that had used rubbers on the balcony and blood on the sheets. When she complained she was told that is was a mistake that housekeeping didn't clean that room yet oops. When they did come to clean the room they said they ran out of king sheets so she would have to deal with this queen sheet until the next day. They said there was a pull out sofa, but there was not so they brought a roll away bed that had makeup all over the sheets. All of my guests experienced similar issues with housekeeping( hair everywhere, lipstick on glasses. razors left in room, gum on desk, coffee stains on counter, bed was broken, cleaned with do not disturb sign on once, but never again, didn't bring toilet paper etc.) I could go on and on with how horrible it was and no one would really take responsibility it was a computer error blah blah blah. My dad left his suit in the room when they left I called 6 hours later and the suit is still nowhere to be found. They did not do anything for my husband and I until I went to the desk and told them to do something so they gave us a $50 dining and upgraded us one night in the wrap around( which they now say makes everything better( it was a $100 upgrade from where we were)). They also gave my mom and aunt a dining credit after I called and asked to talk to a manager. Some of the staff is nice at the moment, but does not follow thru. Natalie was great and she did put notes on my account that it was my wedding and honeymoon and that there were guests connected with us and also noted the problems. Rico was another great manager that helped me out. No-one went above and beyond unless I contacted them.There is no communication or concern in this hotel. The staff is rude and does not care about their guests. The wicked spoon was ok,but rude and when one of my guests went there at 1 they could not even finish their lunch because when they went up to the buffet they came back to their table cleaned off. They spoke to the manager who basically told them too bad its closing time at two. So There was some good stuff. The Henry restaurant was amazing great staff and awesome food. The hidden pizza place was great too, but go for the 10 slice whole pizza for around $22 with toppings vs. $18 for four slices individually( they won't tell you this). If you ask them for their phone number you can call ahead and then you don't have to wait. THe bartender Char and manager on the floor at night Marie were awesome and so sweet! The hotel is gorgeous, but unless their customer service increases they will not be around very much longer!

Property had been open about 4 months by then and most of the kinks seemed to be worked out. It took us about 10 minutes to check in, and were put on the 65th floor in a corner suite that overlooked the Bellagio Fountains as well as the Eiffel Tower. Room was spacious with a separate bedroom and living area, and we had no issues operating the lights or the TV. My only complaint about the room layout was how open the bathroom was to the sleeping area in the bedroom - made it impossible to turn on a light in the middle of the night without flooding the whole room. The other issue I had that has been mentioned by other reviewers is noise filtering through the windows - being right on the Strip you can hear traffic noise, along with the fountains and nightclub pool area. I did have earplugs with me but could occasionally hear noise through them. The next time I stay will likely request a room that does not overlook the Strip, as that will rectify most of the noise issues. Like many guests our final bill showed use of items from the mini-bar that we did not use, and the front desk removed those items without question. Got a chance to eat both breakfast and dinner at the buffet, and would highly recommend both. Selection does not quite rival Bellagio, but ingredient quality and number of personalized stations make up for that. I preferred the dinner buffet to the breakfast buffet, as selection was a little sparse at breakfast. Also had dinner one night at Holsteins, and if you like burgers and shakes would highly recommend it! The one place I would have liked to try but did not have time this trip was Jaleo, and will definitely hit that on a future visit. Temps were in the mid-50's for the duration of our stay, so did not get a chance to use the pool area. Pools are heated, but getting out into cold temps and high winds isn't my cup of tea. Did see a few brave souls down there when we walked through. I did like the layout with all of the TV's and the sports area, and would have loved to use it. Not a big fan of the casino - in addition to high table limits for most of my stay there is a lot of live music venues throughout the area that can be heard on the casino floor. Bands tended to cater to a pretty young crowd, and often played so loud you couldn't talk to other people at your table. I ended up doing most of my gambling next door at Bellagio - more table selection and better drinks. Don't think I was the only one, as the casino floor was deserted most nights. I know the property is going for a young crowd, but might want to tone down the noise a bit on the casino floor. Overall had a great time, and plan to stay at the property in the future. The size of the room and balcony offering just can't be matched by many properties in the market, and I prefer the central location relative to staying down at Encore or Wynn.", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cgreat view poor service\u201d", "Author": "cabbino", "ReviewID": "UR116815746", "Content": "Sent: Monday, August 15, 2011 3:59 PM Subject: Cosmo We arrived at the Cosmopolitan hotel in Las Vegas for my Daughter's wedding on Thursday Aug 4th 2011 at 10:30 Am. The first thing I was informed of at check in was they needed 150 dollars per night for each night we would be there. Making it 600 dollars. We were never informed of such a charge. The manager Tarren came over and told us if we didn't pay the money they wouldn't let us stay there. My husband gave his debit card and they pulled $600.00 from our account then I was informed that it would take 5-7 business days after we checked out before it would be back in our account. I talked to the Jen @ the travel agency to get some help because several guests would have a problem with this extra money going out and even the travel agent was not aware of this high of a fee. The cost was reduced for the rest of the guest's to only $150.00 for the whole time. The manager decided to put his name on my card and let me know that he was the tall , dark, handsome one if I needed anything else. we were to have a block of rooms as they told my daughter on Tuesday night 02 Aug 2011, instead they had everyone all over the place. I was on the 52nd floor of the east tower , my daughter on the 58th floor of the west tower. My sister on the 64th floor of the west tower. My room I had to ask for towels & bed sheets 3 times no one ever did bring them. On Friday the 5th I was to be put near my daughter on the 58th floor of the west tower. I spoke to front desk at 10am told them I didn't care when the room was ready but don't take me out of my room till the other one is ready. What did they do ? At 11:30 am we were locked out of our room. I was back & forth down 52 floors across the entire hotel to the other side only to come back from 10:30 am on Thursday till after 1PM Friday. Taking care of our guests problems. My Daughter the BRIDE & reason everyone was there couldn't get toilet paper in her room and was using Kleenex. We finally get on the 58th floor of the west tower. The towels had makeup all over them, used razors on the tub, the tub dirty, red colored lipstick on the glass. You have to pay to be in chairs by the pool, I had to get towels from the pool to use in our room. The couch did not pull out to a bed and we had no extra blanket for my niece. This time someone came up with towels, but never took the dirty ones or brought an extra blanket. We were told we had a mini fridge, we did but all rooms kids or not had them filled with liquor, you can't use them. They charge you $25 to empty it and $25 each day it's empty. The same with the box of condoms, lubricants and porn books & snacks on the counter. The rooms have no place to put your clothes, no dresser. My sister, who had my 2 nieces with her, had a used condom on the balcony, rags, cigarette butts all over, broken glass & beer bottle tops. There was blood on her bed spread, the TV worked for half a day out of the 5 we were there, the shower handle was broke & the stopper for the tub was missing. Every time I was talking to the manager about this I kept hearing the same thing sorry but they never got the problem fixed. Everyone had room that were not clean. Housekeeping NEVER came to clean the whole time I was there. I left the hotel on Monday 08 Aug 2011 at0400am it took 20 minutes to check out because 6 people were down there yelling about things with their rooms. I called the hotel about 0530am to inform them that we left my husband's suit hanging in the closet. I was told they couldn't do anything because they already put someone in the room. I called my daughter who went everywhere to get some help. It was left with we had to wait till the people in 5897 called back. I finally received a call Tuesday saying the people called in & the suit wasn't there. Now we had been on the phone Monday & Tuesday with lost & found, at you begging call, the front desk and housekeeping. They finally sent security to my daughters room to fill out a claim. Today is the 15th I still want to know how they could clean a room & have someone else in it by 0530am. The manager of Security Brian said no one was placed in the room . he had no report & didn't know about anything till I called him. 2 days later he had a bunch of questions & tried to say that someone could have come in the room and taken it. Please with the money, jewelry and everything else I don't think that someone went to the closet to take the suit out since all the suite cases were in front of the closet door so they were out of our way. I was so disappointed in this place and for being a new hotel & what you pay forget it. My sister had it the worst. No TV with 2 kids, a fridge you can't use, the place a mess. That place will say sorry & do NOTHING about it, they have no communication and an I don't give a crap attitude !!

The Cosmo has all the right elements and it's really great. I hope their goal is to go from 'great' to 'perfect.' More about the Location: I initially thought the Cosmopolitan was going to be another of the thousand or so structures that make up the next-door City Center. Once I learned that the Cosmopolitan was a separate entity, yet affiliated with Marriott, I felt it would go to the top of my list, since I love Vegas AND collecting Marriott points. Note: Since the Cosmo is a part of the premier collection, it cost me a huge number of points to get a 'free' room, but it was well worth it. The location affords the Cosmo with great convenience for walking the strip, and the views of the next-door Bellagio fountains are simply phenomenal. An added bonus is the East Tower fitness center which overlooks the fountains almost at eye-level. Great inspiration for a work out! Next, the Atmosphere. The Cosmopolitan adopts the post-modern boutique aesthetic, creating darker, mood-lit public spaces that are punctuated with striking lighting fixtures, digital artwork, sculptures and textures that look right out of a magazine. Steve Wynn's properties have similar uses of visual stimulation, although on a decidedly more open, brighter scale. This place lets you know that you will not feel old or stuffy here, it's just not allowed. True enough, there are people of all ages taking in the sights and sounds at the Cosmo. NOTE to the management: Employees need name tags. It is tough to tell sometimes that the staff are working because their standard uniforms are so high- end and stylish. The lighting is just dark enough to not be able to tell if this young person in a nice suit and tie is here to help, or here to be seen. They are polite and friendly, but hard to identify. Now for the rooms: MY ROOM WAS AMAZING! With the massive number of Marriott points I sacrificed for my reservation, plus the number of nights I was staying, I was upgraded to a one bedroom suite on the 60th floor of the East Tower. Bear in mind that none of the Vegas properties give an accurate numbering system to their floors, but 60 out of 75 floors is not bad. My suite contained a plush wrap-around sofa, kitchenette with a well-stocked (and standard overpriced) minibar fridge, and a curious microwave. The desk area was large and uber media friendly with connections for everything on the market. Odd that there was no separate phone for the living area, only a single phone in the bedroom. The bathroom was one of the more inventive spaces, as it spanned the length of the room and encompassed a double sink, separate WC, walk-in shower for 2 (or 6) and a japanese soaking tub set in a picture window overlooking the Vegas valley. NICE! The sleeping area contained another huge flat TV, a gorgeous comfy bed and led out to a very generous-sized balcony. Yes, my room overlooked the pool with the never-ending party. The noise was noticeable, but it's VEGAS - people party in Vegas. The fact that the party was within view and hearing of my room made it possible for me to enjoy it without paying the cover charge. One curious element of the Cosmopolitan is that it seems to have swallowed the Jockey Club time share property. Beneath my majestic view of the Bellagio and the mountains, I noticed a sad little building with an enclosed pool and tennis courts. Not sure why they didn't buy out but beware its there. As for the small things, the amenities of this hotel are great and well planned. the toiletries include high end shampoo, conditioner, lotion and yes, Shower Gel! The only bar soap is a large square piece of millery appropriate for the soaking bath tub. Nice job! The pool areas are all well designed with a small flaw. They are way too tiny for the massive numbers of people that can fit into the Cosmopolitan's 2 towers. Yes there are 3 pools, however one is absorbed by the night/day club, not for everyone. The remaining two seem cramped when there are a lot of people there, and with the large numbers of cabanas and day-beds available for rent, it seems there's not enough democratic space for those who just want some sun and a lounge chair. Still, the lounge chairs are deeply padded and well worth getting there at 8am sharp to snag a spot. I've read many of the reviews of the Cosmpolitan and I can understand that a new place has bugs. Without building a pyramid or a castle, perhaps the Cosmopolitan can create a clear answer to the question \"what is it\" so that the employees know what to provide and the guests know what to expect. For me, a great view, huge room, and a slice of all the best parts of Vegas made the Cosmpolitan a new addition to my Vegas favorites list.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cgreat location. service was ok. staff could do with a good customer service course\u201d", "Author": "Gabi S", "ReviewID": "UR116746821", "Content": "WE stayed for a week and only booked this hotel because the rooms had balconies.

We opted for the one bedroom terrace(balcony), on the 50th floor facing South. The terrace is a great place to start the day. The little lounge seat is very comfortable. I only wish there was more seating available. Our room overlooked the night club Marquee. Some reviews mention the loud music, but that did not bother us as it was not all that loud. Marquee was only open one night during our stay. The room had a nice lounge area, that you could close off from the extremely comfortable bed area. This comes in handy if one person in your party wants to sleep and the other watch tv. The bathroom is beautifully designed and well layed out. The double sinks separate the toilet and a shower area. The shower is very spacious and has two windows, one that looks into the bedroom and the other to the outside. The tub is enourmous and also has a view outside and an opening into the bedroom. *There's a mini bar with snacks and I warn you not to move anything unless you intend on paying for it. Everything is sensored so it will automatically be charged to your room if something is moved from its slot. The RTC bus stop is right outside the hotel. Getting from the strip to your hotel room was very convenient as elevators were readily available and fast. The front door of the cosmo drops you right onto the strip with minimal walking. The pool area is nice, but small and can get very crowded at peak times. The gym costs $15 to use and is open 24 hours, but the minimal amount of equipment in my opinion doesn't warrant such a high price.

The bathrooms are huge and interesting - just a curtain separates your roommates and yourself. So if you are bringing your cousin or a niece or nephew, this is your warning. I'd suggest looking for good rates. They don't seem to follow the same structure as other hotels on the strip where the best advice is to book early and then update for the better rate as the fluctuate between when you book and when you arrive. Many seem to drop to the lowest in the last 3 weeks for low times. This place seems to be pretty standard, but high times are awfully pricey. The food options in this hotel are top notch. You can spend a week in Vegas and just eat at the Cosmo and you won't be disappointed... and if you are there for a week, try the brunch buffet. Unreal.

We stayed over my birthday, from Sunday-Friday.

I HIGHLY recommend splurging a bit for one of these rooms. Enjoying a bottle of champagne on the terrace, overlooking the fountains upon arrival was the perfect start to a fabulous vacation. That afternoon we had an amazing \"snack\" at Milos. The bartender, Elliot, was absolutely terrific. The service he extended simply could not have been better. Dinner that night was at Scarpetta, which was also fabulous. Their beef shortribs were the best I've had. We also dined at Holsteins, STK, had room service, etc - all were exactly what you'd expect...but better. Everything about the property was incredible - from decor to quality. Almost all the service we had was phenomenal - with the exception of Vesper (the bar by the Lobby) and one cocktail server we had at Boulevard Pool one of the days. However, the pool cocktail servers each of the other days couldn't have been nicer or more attentive (Alicia and Robin were particularly great). I highly suggest getting a cabana or daybed if you are there Monday-Wednesday. Their rates are significantly reduced those days and it's great to have a luxurious home base and escape from the sun. It was well worth it. To work off all the mind-blowingly indulgent meals, we did visit the fitness facility many of the days we were there. It's the best I've ever seen, with great classes (which I didn't make, but liked the offerings) and top of the line equipment, including tv's/internet/games all via touchscreen at each piece of cardio equipment.

Our Guest Services Agent was wonderful, she upgraded us to a room with an amazing view since it was my friends birthday. What a wonderful way to start the weekend off. Upon entering the room we were absolutely stunned at the view. We were able to see the Bellagio Water & Light show from the 35 floor while we were relaxing on the sofa on our balcony. Totally amazing! The room was well appointed with a very comfortable bed. Two large plasma's were placed in both the sitting room and the bedroom. A sliding door was available to separate the room off. The room also featured a sink, microwave, minibar & snacks. The furnishings were very chic and modern. The bathroom was spacious and featured both a shower & a tub. The tub had seating for two, but no jets like a whirlpool or spa. This is probably one of the only few things I could complain about if I wanted to be picky. The light system was controlled by Lutron switches so that you set the perfect mood in the suite. The TV controlled everything in the room via remote. The most amazing part of the experience at the hotel was being able to use the Boulevard Pool. The pool had an incredible design and had three different water features- two pools to cool off in and a huge hot tub. There were also pool tables, a ping pong table, a shuffle board table & two fooseball tables. There was one area that even had numerous plasmas with sports on them--come September I'll be sitting at the pool sipping on a drink, watching some football! Overall a great experience.

The atmosphere for a group celebrating is perfect. We visited the gym once, it was nice, pretty empty, $15 per person. The Bamboo pool is also very nice and relaxing. Plenty of chairs, nice waitresses. The guys in our group enjoyed the Marquee Day Club, the girls, not so much. The casino is nice, but the table limits are all very high.

Something is severely wrong at the Cosmo and it's sad because the hotel has a lot of potential to be one of the top properties in Vegas. A planned seven week stay for a business trip at the Cosmopolitan was cut short to 17 nights. Staying one night longer was intolerable. The good and the bad and the terrible; with the good first to be fair: 1.) The Cosmopolitan has an unbeatable center Strip location right next to Bellagio. 2.) It\u2019s new, striking and very hip. Great interior design. 3.) Excellent large room and suites done very stylishly and comfortably. Wraparound Suites are full apartments located on the corners of the building. 4.) The best Strip views of any hotel if you stay in the East Tower of the Cosmo. 5.) Food and beverage outlets on the second floor are away from the casino area. We tried them all and they are superb. The Cosmopolitan has one of the best groups of dining venues in Vegas. So the good points are very good. However, this stay was my third and final stay at the Cosmo. This year I\u2019ve spent five weeks total as a guest in the Cosmopolitan. The hotel has some great points but the poor service negates all of the positives. I checked into the Cosmopolitan room 3793 on July 14 and checked out on August 1. During my stay I experienced some of the worst service imaginable provided by a very friendly and seemingly capable staff that just doesn't execute. Now for the bad and the terrible \u2013 it\u2019s a long review of the bad and the terrible: Housekeeping and Maintenance: Upon check-in on July 14 into room 3793 I encountered the following housekeeping and maintenance problems: 1.) A soiled feminine hygiene product in the nightstand drawer; totally disgusting. 2.) Food from previous guests in the kitchen cupboards. 3.) Carpet so stained and filthy that it turned bare feet black. Drink stains glaringly obvious on the carpet. 4.) Hair and a sticky gooey stain on the nightstand. 5.) Burned out light bulbs in the kitchen, living room and bathroom. 6.) Filthy air conditioning filters and a room that wouldn\u2019t properly cool. 7.) A telephone that wouldn\u2019t work. For a hotel less than one year old the room was in a shockingly poor condition. Upon encountering the room in such a poor condition I called guest services which is called \u201cBeck n Call\u201d at the Cosmopolitan. After much insistence (it took three calls to Beck n Call) a housekeeping supervisor called me back. Robert, the housekeeping supervisor, was very friendly and genuinely concerned. I told him the carpet needed cleaned immediately and the room thoroughly scrubbed. Robert gave me a $50 Cosmopolitan gift card for my inconvenience due to unacceptable housekeeping issues (a laughably petty amount when taking into consideration that I was a guest with a planned seven week stay in a suite averaging $450 per night). To Robert\u2019s credit the issues were taken care of quickly except for the carpet cleaning which took two attempts. Even after the second attempt it was still stained. Maintenance responded quickly and fixed the telephone, air conditioning and changed light bulbs. During all three of my stays at the Cosmopolitan a recurring theme occurs: the guest room is very shoddily cared for but if you DEMAND service it will be provided. However unless you are very persistent housekeeping and maintenance service is very shoddy. Daily housekeeping service was a chore. Beata, the day Floor Supervisor, is wonderful. She was the most switched on and professional employee I encountered at the Cosmopolitan. However Floor Supervisors change and when Beata wasn\u2019t available daily housekeeping service suffered. Small things like removing the kitchen trash would be forgotten. Dirty kitchen floors went unmopped and other unacceptable sloppy housekeeping standards were common. When we encountered a good housekeeper and requested her every day she was working even this simple request couldn\u2019t be organized by housekeeping. Noise: Noise is a huge issue at the Cosmopolitan East Tower. Even on the 37th floor the Marquee Day / Nightclub was very noisy. On Monday nights (service industry nights) the music was very loud even on the 37th floor. The noise was loud enough to prevent sleeping. If you select an East Tower room you have a lot of benefits including far better views than the West Tower. But noise from the Strip or Marquee Day / Nightclub are huge issues for East Tower rooms. Room Service Understaffed and hopeless sum up room service. 75 minute wait times for an order to be delivered? At the prices charged I expect quick delivery of food. That\u2019s not going to happen at the Cosmo. Pools What a disaster; the Cosmo has three pools. One is the Marquee Dayclub which charges a cover and is very loud and crowded and definitely not for the over 35 crowd. The other two pools are so overcrowded that it\u2019s impossible to get a chaise lounge. Even a spot to place your towel by the poolside is close to impossible. The overcrowding of the pool areas really put me off this hotel. I\u2019m certain the Cosmo is going to lose a lot of non-party types due to the severe overcrowding of their two main swimming pools. Pool service \u2013 haha \u2013 what a joke. If you can even manage to find a chaise lounge don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be coming by offering drinks and Evian facial spritzers. This ain\u2019t the Four Seasons\u2026\u2026. The Guests / Crowd This average Cosmopolitan guest on the weekends is very young \u2013 under 35 yo \u2013 and there to party. My breaking point arrived when a very young and inebriated guest was being held up by two friends and projectile vomited in the elevator with a bit of it slopping onto my shoes. What else can I say about the Cosmopolitan? I\u2019m glad to be out of there. Summary: Avoid this hotel like a plague if you expect good basic service and a mature adult crowd of guests. Service is very poor and the crowd is very young and party oriented.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit", "Title": "\u201cThe Cosmopolitan a room with a View\u201d", "Author": "DetTripper", "ReviewID": "UR116361872", "Content": "Our Second stay at the The Cosmopolitan, a little better than the first... which was pretty good. We checked in on a Wednesday afternoon, very quick and efficient. I had reserved a Terrace Suite and was offered a Wraparound Suite for $50.00 per night more, sure why not. We checked into the room and it was 1200 sf beautiful. We were in the west tower, 25 th floor overlooking both the Bellagio fountains and the Marquee pool. A Important note here .... There are very few rooms in the Cosmopolitan that you will not hear the music from the Marquee Day/ Night Club..... 50% of the rooms a lot noise, 25 % of the rooms quite a bit, 25 % of the rooms some. Please keep this in mind when booking here. If you want a dead quite sleep with no noise from people enjoying the Vegas nightlife, then stay at the Trump or Mandarin Oriental, no clubs there. If your in town to enjoy the late night activities, this is the place to stay. Now back to the review. To us it was obvious they have been working on customer service. Everyone was friendly, a few mornings we slept in very late and a phone call to the \" Beck and Call\" desk had the room cleaned in a couple of hours with a follow up call asking if all was done as requested. The dealers were friendly and helpful using our names once we gave them our Cosmo Identity players cards. We enjoyed several restaurants and the Boulevard Pool, reviews to follow, and service was good at all. We did not have any key card issues, in fact they added lighted instructions to the elevator panels showing where to insert your card for floor access. a few minor issues Housekeeping... did not replace the dirty towels they took on two occasions, a call took care of that in about 20 minutes each time. and the trash can under the sink did not get emptied unless we set it on the kitchen floor. Gambling. They raise the minimum bet at some of the tables to $50 or $100 in the evenings. These stay empty while the $15 and $25 tables are busy. Check in and Check out. Not a problem for us during the week, but walking by the front desk on Fri, Sat and Sunday ..long lines....especially bag storage on Sunday morning. We were reminded again why we like the vibe of this place when we visited the Wynn/Encore resort. The Wynn is very large and seemed smokier. We like the smaller more sexy feel of the Cosmopolitan. All in All a great stay and we will stay here again. Final Note : Based on my last stay and what I was told by several Cosmopolitan people, the safest way to get a quieter room is to book a Terrace Suite.

This trip was a six night total stay - Three at Aria, Three at Cosmopolitan. Cosmopolitan: We got in line to check in and heard people saying that rooms weren't ready. People were being checked in and told they would be notified when their rooms were ready. We were checked in and told that because I am a Marriott rewards member, she \"found me a nice upgraded room\" and check in was completed. We headed to the East tower, 68th floor. Room was nice, nothing spectacular, very little drawer space and you couldn\u2019t use the refrigerator for your own items as it was stocked with goods that are weighted and billed upon movement. We headed down to the pool. To our surprise, all poolside lounge chairs & cabanas were marked/saved and required a fee. We found non-poolside, non-pool view chairs and settled in to relax. Music was loud \u2013 this was a younger crowd. We are 50ish \u2013 while there were servers, we were not offered beverage service. We stayed approximately one hour and left. That night I woke to the booming and thumping music from the club located on the 4th floor. Again, we were on the 68th floor. It was so loud we could clearly hear the DJ soliciting screams and cheers from the club goers. I thought perhaps this would end at 2:00 am however 2:00 came and went and the noise continued. I called the front desk and learned that the club remains open until 4:00am. I immediately asked for a room reassignment. They moved us to the West Tower. It was 2:30 am and we had to dress, repack all of our belongings, go down through the casino to the lobby to get keys for a West Tower room. I learned that this happens often \u2013 East Tower is beyond noisy, West Tower is quiet. Why oh why would you assign a party of two, 50ish yrs old to the East Tower? This was a complaint, waiting to happen. Our room reassigned was to another upgraded room. It was spectacular and quiet however it cost us a night\u2019s sleep to get it. Additionally, this refrigerator had some stock items missing and open containers left behind inside of it. These items were charged to us and showed up on our bill \u2013 we brought this to their attention upon checkout and the charges were removed. Our first night was more than disappointing. Subsequent nights were fine. Overall we found that this hotel caters to a different crowd. We are not a dance and party-type \u2013 \u201chip\u201d or not the Cosmopolitan does not cater with \u201cservice.\u201d The hotel is lovely and we did meet a few employees that provided a high level of service, unfortunately they were few and far between. For a REALLY great hotel experience \u2013 we recommend Aria. For us, Aria had a much nicer room, with exceptional service and overall provided a much better experience.

The queuing got beyond a joke, queuing for taxis, waiting to check in, queuing to get in the marquee club, the list goes on.

We paid to upgrade to a wrap-around terrace suite at check-in and let me say that suite was bananas. It was enormous....so large that it has a doorbell because there's no way you are hearing someone knock on the door when you are in the bedroom. It's got a kitchen (but nothing to cook with) a large fridge, wine cooler, etc. 2 full bathrooms, one with a tub and a shower, one with just a shower. The tub was HUGE. Living room was nice and spacious, with a large HDTV. The bedroom also had a large HDTV and a very comfortable bed and sheets. The best part is the wrap-around balcony which has basically a 180 degree view of vegas. We could see the entire south strip as well as the Aria on one side, and way down las vegas blvd on the other, including PH, Paris, all the harrah's stuff, wynn, encore and the venetian/palazzo. Service was great everywhere we went. We ate breakfast at the Henry one day, we had room service a few times (all good), we also ate at Jaleo, and the No-name pizza place a couple of times. We also had drinks at Bond and Chandelier. Cocktails were professionally prepared and service was excellent. At Chandelier they have some sort of ice-maker that makes denser than normal ice cubes and they don't melt in your drink. The location is very good. It's a very short walk to Crystals at City Center, Bellagio, PH, etc. My only negative was housekeeping could have been slightly better. No major complains just little odds and ends that weren't quite done. For instance they left a empty cup on the counter rather than throwing it away and there was a glass on the balcony someone that stayed before us used as an ashtray that was there when we checked in.

The only thing that let it down was the very poor security and customer service. We stayed for 5 nights April 2011 and on the last night our safe and presents that we bought were stolen from our room. We didn\u2019t notice until the following morning that, the whole safe was actually ripped off the wardrobe shelf, which was only lightly screwed on I might add. When this was reported to hotel security and the police we had to spend a whole morning giving statements. The police asked the hotel for a lock interrogation, which stated that we went out at 17:56, and then the door was closed from the inside at 18:10 and re-opened and closed at 18:20, then opened again at 23:45, which was when we actually got home. At first the police tried to say that we left the door open and the intruders came in 15 minutes after we went out. I challenged the police and security to try and leave the door open, after 15-20 attempts they were unable to do so, the door is so heavy it shuts tight even if you leave it ajar 3 inches. It is still a mystery as to how they gained entry, as no key was used. There are no CCTV cameras in the hallways, only in the stairwell and elevators, which anyone can use, providing they enter at the same time as someone with a room key! Within 30 minutes of reporting the theft, our passports, kindle and purse were found by guests in a room 7 floors below ours! I asked if there had been any other problems like this, the hotel security said no (as you would expect) but the police told us that they have had quite a few problems, but this was the first time the whole safe was actually taken. We have since been repaid for the lose of the safe contents by the hotel insurance company, but have received no apology or compensation from the hotel on the day or since. In fact they even changed the reading of the lock interrogation to say that we went out at 18:00 and came home at 23:45 and that the door was left open for 6 hours Strange that we had to use the key to get into our room! Far from an apology they told us that we should be thankful that they allowed their insurance company to repay us the full amount stolen as Nevada law only stipulates that they only need to pay $500.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cDoesn't get any better than this!\u201d", "Author": "HockeyMom480", "ReviewID": "UR116193103", "Content": "There are no words to explain how much we enjoyed our stay at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas this past weekend.

Pretty good and staff member was nice and friendly - Tick Room was awesome, view was spectacular and air conditioning fully functional - Tick Fridge was empty which was not a problem, I'm not a mini bar raider type of guy, but there was an empty bottle of vodka in the freezer and a cupboard full of trash under the sink. Not so good. After 5 days of housekeeping it was still under there, and we were not going to touch it or allude to it, so it's probably still there. The housekeeping otherwise did an excellent job, with fresh towels, toilet paper and beds made, so I was pleasantly surprised, not that any decent hotel shouldn't be up to this minimum standard, but some reviewers below have had their troubles. Sunday night was lovely and quiet, so I had my fears allayed about getting no sleep.......until Monday night. On Monday night the bass and music were so loud that I couldn't sleep and frankly I was pretty pissed. I don't mind partying and partying hard, heck, this is Vegas Baby, but why on Earth would you have such sub par soundproofing for the 90% of people who are actually in bed by 3am? However, Tuesday-Thursday sleep was perfect and there was no noise - Go figure? The good far outweighed the bad but, to be perfectly honest, I would have been outtathere if the night club noise kept me up for a second night, so I can not comment on the weekend which might very well fall into that category. All in all, I would definitely stay here again, it was great and I had 2 kids with me and found it great for them.

I tagged along in order to \"research\" what the restaurants in Vegas were doing. From the moment we got out of the taxi, I could tell it was going to be a great experience. Check-in was a breeze and we were upgraded to a larger room with a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains. In addition to the fantastic array of restaurants (we dined at Comme Ca, Jaleo, Wicked Spoon and Holstein's...all were excellent!), they have a great collection of clothing stores you don't see every day, including two of my favorites, Stitched (mens clothing) and Droog (interior accessories). For breakfast on most days, I skipped the buffet and headed for the comfy confines of The Henry, near the strip entrance. Excellent breakfast and a fun, friendly staff AND HUGE coffee mugs filled with great coffee made every morning a great one. The highlight, however, was the service from the staff. Especially in the casino. Being a novice gambler, I was reluctant to sit down at a Blackjack table to play (since I had only played on my iPhone). However, once I explained to my dealer (Maria) that I had only a vague grasp of the game, she patiently explained everything to me as we played. In the end, I actually ended up winning a bit more than I started with.

There wasn't a room available when we checked in at 3pm on a Saturday night so they gave us a $25 credit to our room. We were very thrilled with this so we took our bags to the bellhop and explored this large and brand new hotel. We ended up at one of the 3 pools for a drink. It is up on the 14th floor which gives fabulous views of the strip. We sat at the bar and ordered 2 pina coladas (one with no alcohol). Very yummy slushy drinks but pricey!! The bill was $28, so our credit didin't even buy us a drink each! I guess I had major sticker shock, as I know Vegas is expensive. But they were yummy I must say! We got into our room nearly 2 hours later. The room was gorgeous. It has 2 huge bathrooms with great showers. There is a small banquette seating area in the kitchen. The kitchen has lots of cupboard space, fridge, 2 drawer-style freezers, flat-top stove and even a dishwasher. The only thing missing was UTENSILS, CUTLERY, PLATES etc!!!! Nothing was stocked in this beautiful kitchen (except the bar fridge of course). We called down to the front desk and requested some items to be brought up, they said, oh we have a \"kitchen in a box\" for $37 for your entire stay. We were not aware of this cost before but agreed and asked it to be brought up right away. It never arrived. There is a small but trendy desk and chair with a flat screen TV. The TV had satellite music which was a great touch but both my friend and I kind of expected that there would be a docking station in either the bedroom or the desk area. That would be a good addition to the high end furnishings. Our balcony was huge with nice comfy lounging chairs that overlooked the Bellagio pools! So cool. An amazing view. Bed was very comfy and had another flat screen TV. No robes so we called down the front desk and asked if there was supposed to be any as this is the type of hotel you'd expect to find some. We also inquired about our kitchen in a box. They were sorry it hadn't arrived yet but there was nothing on our file! So about an hour later our robes showed up. No box again. Guess asking for 2 items threw them off?? Second bathroom was quite roomy with a jetted tub. We left the hotel to explore the strip and hoped the box would arrive while we were out. The hotel is in a perfect location, it is central and has so many amenities near by. There is a ticket center only a 10 minute walk away. We got good tickets for The Lion King for the same night. The hotel also has some trendy bars and a nightclub that was super popular. Saturday night there was a long line to get in. There are many restaurants as well. Although we only had coffee at the cafe which was excellent and also ate at the buffet Wicked Spoon. The buffet was incredible! Lots of selection and my friend who is a vegetarian always found lots to eat. The Wicked Spoon was $35 for a dinner buffet and worth it (crab legs, carving station, asian foods, mexican foods, huge salad bar, pizza, soups, more). Good quality and plenty of food in an atmosphere more like a higher end restaurant than a buffet. So many desserts too- including a gelato bar! We also had brunch there which was very good too. The 2 main pools have their own merits (the third is a more 'exclusive' pool where you pay to sit). The first, the Bamboo pool is more relaxing with more easy going music. Weekend was busy and harder to find chairs but during the week, no problems at all. The Boulevard pool is more high energy. It has a wonderful shallow area that you can easily sit in and lounge without swimming (its about a foot deep). Perfect. At each pool, the staff is very friendly, constantly walking around asking if you need anything. There is a bus stop just outside the main door of the hotel going towards Mandalay Bay and right across the street at the Paris Hotel going out towards the North shopping outlets. There is a high end organic market called Whole Foods about a $15 taxi ride towards the airport. Just a note on buffets, we enjoyed the breakfast at the Paris hotel's The Village and also the lunch at Planet Hollywood was fairly good (just didn't compare to Wicked Spoon but was alot cheaper!). This hotel is new and fun to stay in. I loved the location and the room and would definitely stay again. (and P.S. We finally got a few bowls, plates and cutlery brought up to us 3 days later- it was no kitchen in a box- turns out they were 'sold out' of them!)", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cRight Now, More Style Than Substance - But There's Potential!\u201d", "Author": "SugarBB", "ReviewID": "UR116030724", "Content": "There are really a lot of great things about the hotel; Beautiful lobby, gorgeous welcoming bars throughout the main casino area, fantastic restaurants, great background music and friendly, competent staff manning all of these areas. I think one word that could be used to describe everything would be SPARKLING. And HOT. Wait, that was two words. It was hot both as a destination for the things to do as well as temperature wise. There are integrated plasma screens in many walls throughout the hotel, and they radiate an enormous amount of heat. It's especially noticeable in the elevators, which are packed (anytime, day or night). Don't lean on them if you've got a sunburn! Youch! We had a 1 bedroom terrace room, which looked like the pictures (or, as my dad called it when he came to visit: Design Star Finalist Room because of all the unnecessary tchockies!). It was stylish and comfortable. The bed was fantastic. Whomever picked out the beds, pillows, linens and towels for the place did a great job. Our room was on the 33rd floor of the West Tower, facing the Aria. I had requested a much higher level, but no such luck, which was a disappointment. The one good thing about the location was that the Aria's tower blocked the direct sun which kept the room just a tad cooler. The setup of the bathroom was nice, and the soaking tub (which is big enough for two) was great to sit in and look at the lights of the city. One thing that was a running issue throughout our stay was the room temperature. Even running the aircon full-blast the entire time we barely got the room below 74, which for our Seattle blood is way too warm. Strangely enough, the living room was the perfect temperature, while the bathroom and bedroom were much warmer. The air vent above the bedroom did not seem to work, which directed all the cool air to the living room. We brought it up to the front desk, and they said somebody would be up, but that was the last we heard of it and it never really got any cooler. We ended up sleeping on the couch and napping on the bed during the day. The other issue we had was with housekeeping. They seemed to have the same philosophy I do... Do as little as you possibly can and hope nobody notices. On one hand, I do feel their pain - Everything is so shiny, and there's a lot to dust, but on the other... I just want my TP refilled, trash to be emptied, ice buckets wiped out with new plastic lining and clean glasses to be left behind. We called a couple of times for clean glasses, and unfortunately, we never saw them until our last day there. With all the little things that we kept finding that were missing, we started wondering if it was being done on purpose so they could run it up and get a tip! We liked the integrated services menu; controlling everything from the tv was pretty neat. Except... it was really slow, and at times just didn't work at all. There were times I just pulled out my iPad and used the free wi-fi (another bonus!) to get the information from their website instead of waiting for their in-room system to catch up. The casino was... Really, really sad. Empty. Bored-looking dealers. I even overheard a couple of them complaining about how dead it was. The only tables that had any action were the two or three with limits under $15, which should be a sign to Casino management. We had arrived late on a Monday night, which was Industry night for their nightclub, so the areas around Marquee were hopping. We spent a couple of hours going from bar to bar around the entrances and were very entertained by the crowd. Except for the escorts who were really trying to find company. We knew that kind of stuff happened (especially in Vegas), but there was no discretion... they were loud, pushy and wouldn't take no for an answer. While the club was never as busy as it was on Monday, the number of escorts stayed the same. Get on that, security! Yeesh! Enjoyed all the restaurants we visited; the \"secret\" pizza place (pbr & a slice at 3 am), Holsteins (grown-up shakes & mini-burgers to share), China Poblano (\"Mexican\" side was far more successful than \"China\", but why was a Mexican coke more expensive than a margarita?) and Wicked Spoon was good for our Vegas buffet requirement. We also briefly visited the Bamboo Pool (nice and mellow) and spent some time in the spa. Both services I had (hot stone massage and facial) were great. Common areas of the spa were small, but nice. Overall, the place has potential. Maybe in another 6 months they'll have ironed all the problems out and we can really cool off and enjoy ourselves.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cOur favorite place for a Vegas Staycation!\u201d", "Author": "LynnLasVegas", "ReviewID": "UR116029202", "Content": "The Cosmo is not a place for the budget traveler, but for someone like myself who doesn't splurge that often on fancy getaways or staycations, I enjoy feeling that I am getting something special when I stay here - despite the price tag.

The hotel decor is stylish and fabulous--so modern, yet very \"Vegas\". The chandelier bar(s), Vesper and Bond are gorgeous as is pretty much everyone who works there. The pools are nice too. They might not have a \"river\" or a \"wave pool\" but they make up for it in eye candy and attentive staff. The hotel staff is friendly and hospitable. We didn't encounter one rude person, except perhaps for the staff at the Marquee Club and they're not associated with The Cosmopolitan Hotel. The Marquee Club pool is a different story (and a different review). I highly recommend the Boulevard pool with it's view of the Strip. Our room's terrace and bathroom (2321 in the West Tower) had a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains, the Eiffel Tower at Paris hotel, Jubillee and and all the lights beyond. I don't know how many times I watched the fountain show but I never seemed to get tired of it (yes, it was my first time to Vegas). The hotel had great restaurants--Holstein's was my favorite, although I also tried The Wicked Spoon, DOCG, and Jaleo. Lastly, the casino was just as fab as the hotel. We lost our gambling money, but hey, that's the risk you take! Our dealer was super-friendly and made helpful suggestions to my husband who was just learning to play blackjack. All in all, I can only give the Cosmopolitan my highest recommendation. The location is perfect--right in the MIDDLE of everything. It even smells great inside!!! I was quite happy to come \"home\" to my comfortable bed at this hotel each night. Prepare to shell out some major bucks for everything, though. A poolside bed/set of chairs start at $75 (incl. $50 in food and bev); at the Marquee dayclub it's $100. A coffee and a bowl of fruit for breakfast from the Cafe will set you back nearly $12. I found Holstein's to be the best value for the quality of food (try the Korean burger), although I heard that the Mexican-Chinese restaurant was good, too. One more thing: our room had a kitchenette but no plates or utensils were provided. All that we were given were 2 water glasses and two wine glasses. After reading other reviews about the lack of coffee provided, I packed my own Starbucks Via packets. There was no coffeepot in the room nor were there any coffee mugs. When I requested them however, someone showed up with 2 within 10 minutes. Tip: if you need coffee upon awakening, pack your own coffee AND mug. If you plan to eat leftovers in your room, bring utensils.

Talk with the staff about pool options depending on what you want to do (they have three pools) If you do not like techno/EDM music this should not be your first choice in clubs. There are a fair amount of stairs in the night club too. I found that a bit odd. Pricing was a bit on the higher side, but you are paying a premium for the location, style and rooms. The property is also on the list of top 100 hotels from Travel and Leisure, so it has picked up peoples attention. Overally everything was cool and I would return. All the staff I talked with were very cool and down to earth. Bottom line if you want a chill weekend this is not your place. It is a bit louder with more energy than other strip hotels.

I was not disappointed, however, Encore is still my fav!!! Sorry to admit that on The Cosmo's review, but it's the truth...plus...I still give The Cosmo 4 stars!!! I have no real complaints about this hotel. The staff is great, bartenders AWESOME (Tim at the Chandelier Bar!!!), rooms are large and nice, customer service good, food is decent, and plenty to do within the hotel itself. The check-in process is quick and efficient, however, the staff at the front are not overly friendly. They do their job, but that is about it. Not a negative, but just expected a little more convo and smiles. However, Ali at the front desk is top notch...he provides the type of customer service I expect!!! The rooms are quite large and funky. The shower/tub area is ginormous and a huge plus. However, shower/tub area is so large that it is freezing in there unless you are actually standing under the water. So...didn't really get to fully use the tub area. The vanity/sink top is a bit small for 2 people with lots of product, but not a big deal. Other than that, the room is fab. House keeping is very good at keeping up with messy peeps (my husBAND), but we did have 1 strange encounter with them. My husBAND and a friend went up to the room 1 night to drop some stuff off and when they opened the door there was a lady in there. My husBAND assumed he was in the wrong room as the lady just looked at them and didn't say a word. He went back to the elevator and retraced his steps and ended up back at the same door. This time he knocked and the maid opened the door and simply asked \"May I help you?\". She just gave my husBAND the vibe that this was her room and not that she was cleaning it. He finally got into the room, but just left feeling weird about her being in the room. We tried many of the bars and restaurants at The Cosmo and loved them all. The room service food is a big miss, however. Very bland and ovelry priced, but what room service isn't? The main floor of the Cosmo is predominately non carpeted and very busy. Someone had spilled their drink and my husBAND slipped and fell. There were many employees around, but not one stopped to ask if he was okay or to find out what happened. I guess they assumed he was drunk. We had to go over to security and tell them that they might want to clean the spill up so someone doesn't get hurt. This example is my only real gripe about The Cosmo. While they provide good customer service when you ask for it, they are not very perceptive about someone needing customer service. Oh...one more gripe. We had booked our room on our debit card and given our credit card at check in. When we left, our charges were charged to our debit card. We called and were told that this is because this is the card we used to book and if we wanted to use a different card for charges we would have had to give the other card at check in. WE DID!!! Very strange, but whatevs. Overall a fantastic hotel and I would definitely suggest it to anyone visiting Vegas. However, I do think the Encore has The Cosmo beat in all aspects so I will no longer be cheating on the Encore. Wait...The Cosmo does have a better location than the Encore. It is right near the heart of the strip and you can easily walk to everything. With the Encore, you have to cab it everywhere.

There were just a few items which detracted from the overall experience: 1. It took 20 minutes to check in. When on business trips, I want to wait no more than a few minutes. I could easily discern the problem; it takes way too many steps to register guests. 2. I arrived at the hotel's Wicked Spoon restaurant at 8:10 am and waited 20 minutes for a table when the restaurant was less than 10% occupied. Despite multiple requests, the server never got around to bringing me my coffee and juice until I had finished my breakfast. To the hotel's credit, the buffet at the Wicked Spoon was worth enduring the service issues. The selection and quality was out of this world. Also, when I emailed the hotel manager about the two issues above, he provided a customer focused response. My guess is that with some more time, this will be great service hotel.

I had to cancel the reservation and make a new one to get my card credited. Check in was fine, lobby is beautiful and taxi drops you off at registration area, no need to drag your bags thru the casino first. Rooms were very nice, however maid service was terrible. On second evening noticed they had not removed dirty glasses, cleaned the glass door to the shower stall or cleaned the shower (there was still a wash cloth on the floor from that morning) or countertops. Did not notice until the middle of the night that they had not restocked the toilet paper. When this became an issue and I called the desk for more, I was told they had all left for their runs and they would try to see if they could help me. A half hour later, I called again and only after I threatened to flush any other paper in the room did they send someone. Using the elevator is like playing roulette, but not as much fun. A room key must be inserted before you can press your floor. Key pads on both sides of the elevator but key slot only on one side. Sometimes you have to leave the key in and press the floor and sometimes you had to insert and remove the card before you could press your floor. A lot of people rode up and down unnecessarily until they could get to their floor. We were attending a conference and the elevators were so packed they would not stop on that floor if you wanted to go up. Had to press the down button, ride it down to the lobby and then back up to your floor. If you were lucky you only made the trip once. They had several popular clubs there as was evidenced by all the drunken college kids all over the place. Also had an issue with room service. Ordered lunch for 4 people. First time up, they sent all the sandwiches but no sides and forgot 1 beverage. Second trip brought the sides but forgot the beverage. Third trip up to bring the last beverage, waiter felt bad and brought free dessert along with the drink. At least 10 minutes between each trip to the room (guess he had to ride the same elevators as the rest of us).

If you splurge for a room with a balcony, make sure you request it's Bellagio-facing at check-in if you can\u2019t confirm that during your booking. With a private terrace, the view alone from these rooms is worth the stay. In fact, we decided to get some take out from Holsteins downstairs (great burgers FYI) and enjoy dinner on the balcony while taking in the nightly Bellagio water fountain show. Just awesome. The room and venue itself are fantastic. Our Studio room was luxurious and very roomy with a kitchenette (microwave, sink and minbar) an L-shaped lounge, dangerously comfortable king bed and double vanity marble bathroom, complete with an oversized shower and hot tub. All amenities are state of the art: 2 large flat screen TVs and all-control light dimmers. Outside of the room, the pool areas are fantastic as well as the Chandelier Bar: 3 levels of bar built inside a crystal chandelier. State of the art digital pillars will dazzle you in the lobby, nearby is the trendy Vesper Bar while the Wicked Spoon buffet is definite must do: the food is fantastic and the desert bar is to die for. Now the only downside: customer service, which seems to be the issue that most other travellers (for various reasons) have had as well. When we arrived (approx. 3:30pm), we were told our room wasn\u2019t ready. We were told that it should be ready by 4pm but we didn\u2019t receive a call until almost 6pm. We didn\u2019t have plans so it wasn\u2019t that much of a worry but it easily could have been a problem under different circumstances. At check out, we found that we had been billed a huge amount for the minibar: the minibar has sensors so that when you pick an item up you receive a charge because the hotel assumes you have consumed it. Wrong. We were told at check out we could just pay for all the charges now and then call back later to resolve. What? We opted to wait in (a lengthy) line to get it resolved on the spot, which was eventually taken care of. It\u2019s clear why the Cosmo has been labelled the new \u201cit spot\u201d in Vegas: it occupies an envious position at the centre of the Strip with seemingly no expense spared.

Naturally with such a new hotel there are areas in efficiency that could be improved, however the luxurious decor and feel of the hotel supersedes any complaints. The Cosmopolitan is luxurious in every detail - from the wallpaper in the wardrobe to the entertainment in the elevator, I definitely saw how the hotel's alleged $80 billion budget was spent, and believed that my room charge was VERY reasonable. The hotel is located in the prime position of the strip - across from Caesars and next to the Bellagio and Paris. We reserved a Terrace One Bedroom Premium View, with the expectation that I would be provided with a view of the Bellagio waters - as expressed on the website. Luckily during check-in I confirmed whether we were given a Bellagio view and was shocked to find out that I was given an alternate view of the strip. After expressing my dissatisfaction with the room - as a view of the Bellagio waters was my primary reason for booking at The Cosmopolitan, I was upgraded to a higher floor with the Bellagio water view. I was informed that there were apparently 3 views, one of the strip, one of the strip and some of the water, and the premium view of the Bellagio waters. For future I would make SURE that I had guaranteed a Bellagio water view, as it was truly impressive. I was pleased that my expectations were met without putting up a huge fight. The Bellagio water view was AMAZING and had I not had this view, I would not have enjoyed my stay as much. The balcony doors are soundproof and very heavy, however they are effective except for the strongest Bellagio spurts, which only excited me and reminded me that another show had started. The suite was exquisite, and was truly represented by photos on the website. The Marquee Day Club pool parties were amazing. We were informed of different prices when asking different employees, however I believe is was free before midday on weekends and all day weekdays for guests of the hotel, or up to $80 for men and similar for women, just for entry. To rent a leisure bed would require $250 to be spent on the bar and food, and a cabana would require $500 p.p. We went there two days in a row and found no need for a bed, as the weather was great and we found comfort on the edge of the pool. The party is definitely fun and I would recommend it! I believe that Friday is a good day to go and there's hype but its not as busy as a Saturday. There is a great vodka/redbull frozen cocktail and an even better vodka slushie with passion fruit, second or third down on the cocktail list. The two other pools are nice and more relaxed if you're not in the mood for a party, however I believe that similar costs for beds and cabanas are expected, certainly on weekends. Regardless, you can have a great time at the pools without sun baking. The most modern hotel on the strip holds the famed chandelier bar - which is literally a bar in a giant chandelier. While impressive, the drinks list is a bore. Wicked Spoon is a great buffet - we went for brunch and would definitely go again. There is a long line to enter however the line moves very quickly, we didn't wait longer than 15 minutes. For a small additional cost there is a bottomless mimosa/bloody mary which is certainly worth it. I heard rumors that the bottomless mimosa was offered elsewhere within the hotel, however I was informed that the Wicked Spoon was it. The burger place within the hotel (can't recall the name but it was across from the marquee entry) was recommended to us by the concierge, however it was extremely disappointing. We paid $80 and received 4 small 'gourmet' burgers and a poor salad - such a terrible meal! Instead I would recommend Fat Burger which was one of my favorite burger places in the U.S (believe me I tried many) that is open 24 hours and is a really great meal. It's a short taxi ride from The Cosmopolitan or a leisurely walk, and at a fraction of the cost it is certainly tastier and value for money! Room service was fine, just be weary that there are additional costs, as expressed in the menu. But I would certainly recommend it at least once as a treat, as it is presented beautifully on white linens in the lounge room. Misc Tips- -be known that to empty out the minibar is an additional $25 cost, however I was able to have this cost removed as it took them 2 days to remove the contents. -there is a wonderful strawberry daiquiri available across at the Paris hotel, at $17 it is huge and it can be served in a ceramic hot air balloon or plastic Eiffel tower, the best souvenir. -The bed was not as comfortable as I had hoped. - Free wifi was fast. -The lounge on the veranda was a great fit for two people. -The Cosmopolitan is certainly a hotel aimed at ca$hed up 20-30 year olds!

I had to call downstairs from my mobile phone and ask them to send a tech. He was able to fix the problems relatively quickly. Suite had full kitchen, high end stove and oven (Miele brand!) Full size refrigerator (subzero) washer dryer (Swedish), coffee maker(pod system) . Just one tiny problem: No plates, silverware, pots, pans, coffee pods, detergent..Nothing! The entire kitchen is just for show!! Now granted, no one comes to stay here to cook and be a homebody, but it sure would've been great to have something to reheat the leftovers from all those great restaurants. I found out that room service does bring plates and silverware. I tried to get coffee pods for the coffeemaker and was told they do not supply pods anymore! What everyone here says about housekeeping is true: Their service is not the best. The whole time I was there the trash bin underneath the kitchen sink was not emptied. The number of towels left for us fluctuated daily. I even saw the cleaning lady in the hallway, asked her if she is the one cleaning out room, she said yes. I asked for extra towels and couple of other things, she said SURE, I tipped her, thanked her and left. When we came back she had not done any of it.. Now to the hotel: The table games start at 10-15 dollars daytime and $25 night time. About 70% of the table games are closed at daytime due to lack of players. (night time is about 90% open). One big drawback if you like poker: NO POKER ROOM! Which meant I had to walk cross the street to PH or to Aria. Doesn't sound like a big deal at first, but becomes a real drag real soon. Every restaurant we went to was fantastic. Specially the French one Comme Ca. Overall this is a great hotel. I would highly recommend it. But they do need to pay little more attention to the details.

I recommend going to an establishment that cares about their guests. Besides, having been to both day and night club at Marquee, my friends and I found the club to be overly packed with an OK crowd at best. Many people left around midnight including us since we couldn't move at all. The dance floor was also small for the top 40's music, and downstairs seemed like a rave with rude people. Ghostbar, Rain, and Moon were so much more fun at the Palms. Pure at Caesar's is worth checking out for the great view. But if you still want to check out the newest club on the block, just beware you are in for a night of waiting in multiple lines (even with guest list) and being pushed around and waiting around for pricey drinks with poor management. ******************************************************************************* Below is my incident at Marquee Day Club: My letter to the Cosmopolitan Marquee...ignored by the management :( RE: Pool Platform Hazardous to Guest Safety Dear Cosmopolitan Marquee Management, I attended the Cosmopolitan Marquee day club at the pool on Friday, July 15. Since there were music playing and fellow guests were dancing on the plastic box containers in the pool. I decided to join in so I climbed on the clear raised platform by putting both of my knees up on the box; then I stood up on the box, which had a grid of raised squares with very sharp corners. As I got on the platform, I felt a sudden pain on my left knee, then the crowd started to yell \"You're bleeding!\" I looked down to see blood gushing down from my knee so I hurried to get out of the pool. I informed the gentleman patrolling inside the pool of the sharp top of these box containers that are meant to be climbed upon. He sent me to security by the door. Then, a security personnel with black tattoos on both of arms came over, and I told him that the clear platform was very sharp and cut my knee. He told me to follow him across the courtyard to get first aid. I already wiped off the blood on my knee when I got out of the pool, but blood continued to run down my leg so I had to wipe it off again, and he made a mean remark, \"I would prefer it if you didn't use our towels, but oh well, too late now!\" Not only was the security staff inconsiderate, he was downright rude and sarcastic. At the first aid station, I told the Cosmopolitan/Marquee employees that they should remove those boxes in the pool for guest safety. The same security staff sneered and said \"Yea, I can't do anything. People get stupid cuts like this all the time.\" I was shocked that no one cared about the danger the clear boxes pose to the safety of their guests. So before exiting Marquee, I tried to warn the staff about the dangerous hazard again. I spoke with the service manager named Danny/Denny, and he just kept saying \"We just got those boxes, and no one has ever cut themselves.\" He didn't seem to get the fact that my incident can be the first of many. I had expected a little more consideration from the manager, but he treated me like I was just a drunk drama queen who got a small scrape. I have attached a picture of the cut taken after the cut was band-aid; you can see that my skin was lifted off the knee by the sharp grinds on top of the clear box in the pool. The finger in the photograph serves as reference of the size of the scrape; my skin is still raw and my knee is sore from the incident. I am quite disappointed and shocked by the disregard and insolence of your staff. There was no compassion or courtesy from the staff who handled this incident. The management must be aware that the top of the boxes have a sharp top, which can easily hurt your guests. The unsafe boxes placed inside the pool need to be removed or reconstructed to insure guest safety; it is a lawsuit waiting to happen as your staff just shrugs off the incident and disregards guests' concerns. I hope your prestigious hotel and popular club, especially being the newest additions to the Strip, would offer your guest a safe environment on your premise and train your staff to treat guests with courtesy and respect.

Pros: Chic, upscale hotel with ultra modern decor with an eclectic style of furnishings and art. Beautiful room with full balcony over looking the Bellagio Fountains. Excellent food and beverage. I had breakfast and lunch with the conference 3 days, and a reception with hot appetizers (carving stations not cheese and crackers). I had 2 dinners and 1 breakfast from room service. Room service is great, on time, piping hot, served nicely. Nice staff-DJ at the Front Desk, Oliver the Bellman, the security staff, In room dining staff were all very professional and pleasant. Cons: I arrived and the room I booked as part of the conference was not available. I was upgraded to a 44th floor room facing the Bellagio. When I got there someone else had been in the room partying (dirty glasses, empty wine bottle, mussed pillows). I called the Front Desk Manager and was moved to the 49th floor overlooking the Bellagio Fountains. Oliver the Bellman arrived as I was leaving and met at my new room and showed me how to use all the high tech gadgets (phone/TV control everything from lighting to temp). I was given a $150 credit for food/beverage for the trouble. But this process took me about an hour to get to my final room. The next day after my 8 hour meeting I was locked out my my room. It took 1 maid, 2 security guys, and 1 maintainence person to get my into my room and that lasted over an hour. Apparently the lock was dirty and my keys became de-magnetized. I was not told to not to put my keys near remotes, credit cards, and cell phone so that is exactly where I put it. They got me in and Front Desk sent up new keys. When I checked out with DJ (who I also checked in with) I told him of my harrowing experiences and he apologized and applied the food and beverage credit, waived the fee for water and cranberry juice and phone calls leaving me only with the remaining food and beverage charges. He was doing everything he could to make things right. Then 3 days after I left, Accounting charged my debit card for everything DJ took off. So now 4 days later I had to get Accounting to return the money to my checking account. Overall I still loved the hotel, staff, and facilities. But suggest you wait a few months for them to iron out all the kinks. FYI-for perspective the driver told me there we 30,000 conventions in town that week.

Let me say that our room was amazing, great view, very high tech, comfortable bed, and actually pretty clean. However, the rest of the hotel, hallways, chairs in lobby and lounges, pool area, all were filthy. The hotel is less than a year old but looks like it's about 5 years old. I understand that there's a certain party \"meat\" crowd that goes there, but that doesn't excuse all the stains in the carpet and debris that was laying in the halls for several days. All that being said I found the staff to be responsive and friendly. I called down one morning because it was my understanding that each room had a coffee maker, ours did not. When I called to request one they politely told me they had to take the coffee makers out of ALL the rooms because they were too complicated and it was taking up too much time for them to fix/explain how to use them to the guests. They do have a coffee shop at the hotel, $4 for a medium hot coffee though, a bit steep but you're on vacation. Front desk was exceptional, maybe it was the $50 I slipped them at check in, but I was upgraded to a 1 bedroom fountain view with soaking tub on the 37th floor of the west tower. Absolutely gorgeous view! It is true that the East tower is much louder due to Marquee being directly under it, you even hear the music during the day in the west tower. The nights were quiet though. We never had any problems with the TV not working properly as many people have mentioned. In case you don't know you basically control everything in the room via the TV remote. So lights, temperature, music, etc. You can also use light switches on the wall, but that's no fun. There's not a lot of restaurants or shopping in this hotel. Just a few. We ate at Henry's, which is like their diner, but MUCH more expensive. $60 breakfast was a bit much even for high end hotel. We did eat at the pizza place, it was pretty good. Close to NY pizza as you're probably gonna get in Vegas. Tried to eat at the sushi place a couple times but it was closed once and too long of a wait the next time. The pastries at the coffee shop are very good though, and more reasonably priced than the coffee. We did have a problem with the Identity program, that's their players card. Basically when you sign up they give you $10 of free play. BUT, there's strings attached, we never got it to work properly even after asking twice. Actually was quite a pain! There wasn't much action in the casino in general. It's not a large casino and there's not a ton of tables. Also didn't appear to be too many people playing on them, I never had to wait to play any of the tables. The interior design of the entire hotel is very elegant though, even if it is a bit dirty. As I said before it does seem to have a 20 something party crowd, especially on the weekend. Midweek wasn't bad though, mostly business people there. However, if people watching is your thing it's very amusing. Lots of 'meats' walking around looking for the 'snookies'. There are 3 pools, one is the Boulevard which is very nice, sort of calm in the morning then louder in the afternoon, but not too bad. They have a large shallow section that you can just lay right in the water without being completely under, very nice. The Bamboo pool is quieter but a bit too small. The chairs are closer together and again, rather dirty. There is also a day club pool attached to Marquee. We didn't go near it as we're in our 30's and not single. I can tell you that it seemed really loud, if that's your thing! My wife used the gym for 4 days at $15 a day. She found out too late that they have a 3-day pass for a slight discount. Would have been good to know ahead of time. The gym was very clean and modern though. Lastly, the mini bar has a small section at the bottom that you can throw a couple waters or whatever you want to keep cool. The stuff we put there all froze. Also they charged us $9 for something in the minibar we didn't use. I called down and they took it right off the bill. Also, since I guess this hotel is owned by Marriott they allow pets for some reason. Every now and then you'll get a whiff of dog/cat smell in the halls. Kind of gross even for dog lovers! Overall the balcony view, very comfortable bedding, and amazing room in general made up for the rest of the hotel being kind of dirty. I probably wouldn't stay there again just because of the crowd. I would stay back at the Wynn or Encore if you're 30+ years old.

Our bags were brought up within minutes of us arriving in our room by a very friendly man who asked if we had any questions about the hotel or if there was anything else he could do for us. The room was very modern,huge and spotless .And what a veiw,the balcony was a fantastic touch to this already excellent hotel.We did have a problem with our safe and we called and 5 minutes later we had a knock at the door and after changing the battery the problem was fixed. There was 2 large TV's in the suite which made my daughter very happy as she had a TV to herself. The bathroom was also very large with a bath tub,extra large shower, double vanity and a large toilet room.Housekepping was also fantastic and our room was cleaned everyday in the morning with no hassles and all the housekeeping staff we saw always said hello. We went to the pool area on the 3rd floor which was really nice and I didn't see anything that was inappropriet for young children, there were young people but we also saw people of all ages, with and without children. We ate at the wicked spoon 3 times as it was the best buffet we have ever had( the dinner buffet closes early 9pm), and at Holsteins which was also really nice.and had no problems finding them at all.Its fantastic walking around this hotel as there is so many diffrent art pieces to see and photograph, the chandelers are just beautiful.The tables at the casino are a pricey even while sitting at a $25(cheapest at the time)table they change it to $50 without warning, so on last night went to another casino.

We decided to make sure we were that we wouldn't be hungover before we booked it. So Saturday morning we went down and got it for an even cheaper price. It annoyed me that I would have been punished for booking early. The second thing that annoyed me was the service. We had to order lunch 3 times over 2.5 hours to finally get it. We would have to order drinks from two different runners in hopes of getting a drink. Not like any other nice resort that I've stayed at. Not even the service level of hard rocks pool.

The whole hotel is very thoughtfully designed - everything blends together and the attention to detail is simply amazing. Rooms are beautiful and the views are perfect. Anyone who complains that they didn't get a premium view room because they couldn't see the fountains have obviously never had a view of a wall and air conditioning unit. So, here are the top 5 reasons I will be back: 1.) Restaurants - great selection, great experiences at every single one I tried. Loved the pizza at the secret pizza place and the shakes at Holsteins. Yes, the restaurants are expensive, but I felt that they were worth the price. There are cheap eats in Vegas but why do people expect to find them in the most expensive hotels? 2.) Pools - The chairs are actually cushioned! Loved the entire pool scene and never found it to be too loud. Food is so much better than the traditional overpriced fried pool fare. Lots of umbrellas for shade, and the view from the Boulevard Pool is unique. 3.) Casino - so easy to navigate, lots of new machines, drink service was excellent and had difficulty losing at the penny slots. Good promotions too; make sure to get their player's card! Table limits were higher than those at economy hotels, as expected. 4.) Rooms... beautiful, comfortable, amazing! The balcony was so relaxing and the bed was so comfortable that I never wanted to leave the room! Didn't use the kitchenette much, but the rooms are big enough that it's still not a waste of space. Yes, they charge for coffee... welcome to Vegas. The bathrooms were to die for and I had no problems with anything being broken. The little details in the rooms were so pleasant - electrical plugs on the nightstand for my phone charger, beautiful water/martini glasses with the ice bucket. Also, free wi-fi without a resort fee? Yay! 5.) Location - This is my favorite part of the strip anyway, but with the ease of access to the Strip, two crosswalks nearby, and the small size of the casino, I never felt like it was the final death march to get to the room at night. From the front door of Cosmo you are 5-10 minutes from Monte Carlo, Aria, Bellagio, Paris, Planet Hollywood and Vdara. East Tower rooms are about 2 minutes to the front door, West Tower maybe another 5 minute walk through the casino. Very quick and easy. One thing I hope they resolve - some service levels are hit or miss. While it didn't bother me much personally, I don't think the reviews of poor housekeeping here are exaggerated. My room was never thoroughly cleaned once in 9 days, and was missed completely on one day. Calls to Beck and Call were never resolved. However the concierge was fantastic, as were the waitstaff in all the restaurants. Front desk was quick and knowledgeable, and the Identity desk staff were always helpful. Also, if you are concerned about noise from the club, ask for a room in the West tower. I never heard a thing from Marquee.

View from west tower is nice overlooking bellagio fountains but i think east tower would have been better and is clearly close to all strip access and bars and restaurants.

This was a bummer tonsay the least. Clearly not a four star hotel yet!!!!! Neber saw a cleaning person in hallway our entire stay. The casino Seems cosmos casino was afterthought.

Mid week could not play a real game of blacjack for less than 25 bux. Tables were empty and we took our significant gambling money to bellagio and aria! The casino is small and tight.

It was our first trip to Las Vegas. We kept receiving promo mailers for two completely free nights (we think it's our Marriott rewards connection). Eventually they also added a $50 dining credit and a $50 casino credit, so we booked. No problems with booking. Good service there. The line was short for check-in on Friday around dinner time. I think we waited 5-10 minutes. Check-in was easy enough, though we felt like the staff member helping us was less than friendly. I specifically asked about the room requests I had made: west tower, away from elevators, quiet location, high floor. (We had our daughters ages almost-4 and 7 with us, so quiet for bedtime was important.) The employee said he got us a room on the 50th floor with a good view. He mentioned that rooms with a Bellagio view were an upgrade, though he never offered an upsell. We got up to the room and discovered that we were right next to the elevators. It didn't seem too noisy though, so we didn't complain or ask for an immediate room change. We rang bell service to have our bags brought up, and they said it would be about 20 minutes... a reasonable amount of time except for that we were in need of a clean diaper, and they had our diaper bag. My husband couldn't bear the smell, so he left to go scout out restaurants. I utilized some toilet paper and let our youngest run around bare-bottomed until the bags came, which was more like 30 minutes later. The bellman was very friendly. (I found out he used to work at Disneyland... no wonder!) My husband returned shorty with a large pizza from the \"hidden\" hotel pizzeria. It was fairly good. $23 for a two topping, and it was BIG. Used some of our dining credit for that. My husband had also stopped by the concierge desk while he was out. He said they were rather unfriendly and not helpful, which was our experience with them all throughout our stay. He also visited the Identity Membership desk in order to sign up to get our $50 of free casino credit. Those employees were great. After doing some exploring outside, it was bedtime. As soon as out daughters were asleep, we discovered just how loud the elevators were. Basically it sounded like someone was driving a golf cart in circles around our room all night. Needless to say, we didn't sleep well. Note about the beds: they were squishy plush. Nice linens. Oddly enough, they sort of dipped lower at the edges, versus how most beds tend to sink into the middle. As soon as we woke up in the morning, I called the front desk to request a room change. They said that they would be able to move us to another 2 bed terrace studio after 11:00 AM and that they'd call when the room was ready. No one called, so I called back later. I was told that it wouldn't be until after 3:00, but that they did have another terrace studio assigned to us. Fine. Well, no one called, so I checked in again at 6:45. They said they had a room for us. It was two floors down. We packed up our stuff and toted the kiddos out. We had to switch elevator banks, as each set of elevators only go to certain floors. A small hassle, but okay. Well, we walked into the new room. Not only was it not a terrace studio (just a plain double queen room) but there was an open beer can, unmade beds, and visibly debris on the floor. NOT OKAY. I called the front desk. They took a long time to find us another room, another 20 floors down. We then waited 20 minutes (with the now tired kids) for a bellman to bring us new keys. We switched elevator banks yet again and went to the second room. Unbelievable... it was also dirty with a view of a parking garage. By this time. our kids were cranky and tired, and we wanted to cry. I called the front desk (who kept putting me on hold to consult the front desk???) and asked for a manager. I was told a manager would call me back in a few minutes. After 5 minutes and no call, I called again and demanded to speak to the front desk manager. I had to hold, but eventually Lauren got on the line. I told her that this whole fiasco was unacceptable and a waste of our time. I asked if they had any other 2 queen bed terrace studio rooms, and she said no. I have no idea why someone couldn't have just told us that the very first time I called! I asked to please go back to our original room, which was sounding like heaven after this ordeal, and she reprogrammed our keys for us to get back in there. We were offered only a lame verbal apology and an additional $100 dining credit.... a nice gesture. I asked that she send a bellman up with some earplugs, and she confirmed that she would. Well, no bellman ever showed up. I was too tired and frustrated to call the desk again, so we just made due with the elevator noise. The entire fiasco could have been avoided had the very first employee I spoke to just told me the truth. Needless to say, we were NOT impressed with the front desk staff. We ordered room service for breakfast the next morning in an effort to use up our dining credit. It was good but not exceptional. The lady who brought it to the room was very friendly though. We still had dining credit to use, so we hit up the Eat Drink store, where we were told that our dining credit was valid. I got some $7 popcorn. Well, upon reviewing our (on the TV) room folio, we discovered that the charge was still there. There was also a $1 tip charge at a place where we had gotten gelato and clearly marked no tip. I called the front desk, and they said that they could take the charges off, but that we would have to check out at the front desk and sign a form. Fine. Well, we got downstairs to discover an insanely long line for the front desk. With two cranky kids, it so wasn't worth the wait for the $8. So I ran back up to the room and checked out via the TV system. Someone should have more clearly explained to us how the dining credit worked, and notified us that it wasn't good on tips or service charges, like our room service. This sealed the deal on our opinion of the front desk staff. Just awful. We went to the Boulevard pool both mornings. Very nice pool. We got pool chairs both mornings, although on Sunday morning, pretty much every chair around the main pool area was reserved for the cabana rentals. The music was pretty loud, but better than listening to the road noise from the Strip below. The hotel itself was very pretty and modern. Good overall vibe. Our room, aside from the elevator noise issue, was wonderful. The terrace studio was gorgeous and spacious. Ours had 2 queen beds. The bathroom was gorgeous, and our room was very clean. No problems with the technology in the room either. Our view looked south, basically with the Bamboo Pool directly below us. Having briefly visited those two city view rooms, I can tell you that the terrace studio is an upgrade in more than just space. If we were to return to this hotel, I'd only do so if we could afford the terrace studio. While our stay was free, I don't know if I could justify $330 per night for our room, which is why I rated the hotel's value as I did. Overall, as classy, modern hotel that just needs to get their front desk act together. Note: I'm not posting room photos as the hotel's website photos are accurate. However, in a two queen bed terrace studio, the seating area (not the beds) is located next to the terrace.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sutton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFor once, a hotel in Vegas that doesn't take you an eternity to walk through\u201d", "Author": "The_Dootch", "ReviewID": "UR115544834", "Content": "Not a big hotel but just adds to the experience.

Reviews about this place are mixed but it sounded like a place I would like to try. On the whole it did not disappoint. On arrival, I upgraded from the terrace suite to the terrace suite, premium view. A very good choice and worth every penny of the $50 per night upgrade price. By all means that is the way to go if you are going to get a terrace, go for the view of the Bellagio fountains and the view looking toward the north. Room service was excellent and arrived right at the time I requested. Servings were plentiful and food was very good. Positives: spacious suite, L shaped sofa, kitchenette area, large desk, chairs, nice closet, iron and ironing board, safe, slippers, coffee machine (mine took Javapodz), glassware, paper towels, mini fridge, dishwasher, tray of selections you will probably not want to purchase because they are expensive. You move them, you buy them...on smart tray. There is a thermostat you can set, two flat screen TVs and books. Have fun playing with the lighting. They all come on when you walk in the door. On the TV room pompts will let you know how everything works. My favorite tech device was the phone which was very easy to use. Calls to room and other guest services were promptly and courteously answered. Negatives: 1. Managing the suite lighting was a little difficult. 2. The liason for a function at the Chandelier Bar did not let anyone know our group was going to be there. I had communicated with her a few times by phone and email prior to my trip. Good thing I arrived a half hour early. The staff that was on that night was very accommodating and roped off a section for the group. 3. It is difficult to see reward points info on line, Identity Membership. That aspect is not user friendly. Target age group: I saw people of all ages. Some say the 20s group takes over on the weekends but I was not there at that time. There were young and older and all ages in between.

I will start with check-in. The usual Vegas style wait-in-long-queue, then finally get to the desk and are talked into upgrading from our 1BR premium view to the 1BR Terrace premium view, the selling point?? A fully fitted Kitchen (the other only had a kitchenette). Problem being there is nothing in the kitchen, not even a teaspoon! So moving on from the \"Sales\" check-in we then had to wait 2 hours for our luggage to be delivered to our room, only the fact that my husband said he was going down to get it himself did it magically arrive. Next... trying to get \"anything\" to use in the kitchen took me 2 days. It has a coffee machine and 2 cups, no teaspoons, no sugar, no creamer, oh and no coffee, but you can buy some coffee from their mini-bar (as long as you like it unsweetened and black apparently). Finally room service managed to scrounge me up an old pot, pan, 2 plates and 2 bowls, so at least we could make a cup of tea and eat some cereal. Housekeeping, what a joke. They made the bed, end of housekeeping, and even then they managed to put the duvet cover on upside down and hid 2 pillows in the cupboard so they did not have to put covers on them. No wipe-down of any surfaces, no bins emptied, no toiletries refilled, not even new towels. Truly THE WORST housekeeping ever, we ended up putting the \"do not disturb sign\" on and not bothering with it in the end, just getting new towels sent up when needed. The pools, like all hotels in Vegas, they never manage to make any pool large enough to cater for their guests (it is 40 degrees in Vegas, guess what guys? we want to sit by the pool!). The Cosmopolitan has 3 pools but we only went to one, The Bamboo, which is nice enough though quite small and you have to get there by 10am or you cannot find a deckchair, it is very crowded but if you can manage to get a chair in the sun it is OK. The pool bar does food and the service girls are very nice and attentive. The Wok-fried Edamame is the best! The other pool when we tried to go was closed and we were told by other guests that it was even more crowded, then there is the pool at The Marque which is apparently a Day Club but it is open to everyone (you do not have to stay at the hotel) and is not for sunbathing/swimming but if you want to drink copious amounts of alcohol in the scorching heat then you might like this. Other fabulous service, the pool area one day was littered with cigarette butts and there was even cutlery in the pool. When I asked an attendant if it can be cleaned up he said i had to go find a guy in white T-shirt because he had a blue T-shirt, errrr thanks! Also there is no security for the pools, you do not need a key to get to them so I think half the people were not even staying at the hotel, we definitely met some people who were not. But it was not all bad, if you put aside the fact that you are not getting good service then the hotel is very nice, the room we had was fantastic with a great view over the Bellagio water fountains and loved the funky decor and art books. The bars are very stylish and some of the bar staff can even make a cocktail (some can not) and we found all the drink waitresses to be very nice and efficient. The Chandelier bar is fantastic, it is a 3 level bar inside a giant chandelier, very nice. The Book and Stage bar has live bands every night which we loved. The Marque nightclub was too 1990's for us but then I think they all are these days (glowsticks and throw your hands up in the air mic-overs! come on guys lets get some originality). The restaurants were good although the shops were pretty dull. The location is great, with walking distance to all the other casinos/hotels. But of course you have to remember it is Vegas and so far we have found all the hotels to be lacking in the service department (with such high occupancy rates I think they just do not care) so at least this one was modern and had some great art work and free wifi.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat pool scene, high tech decor\u201d", "Author": "Cathy_FS", "ReviewID": "UR115361450", "Content": "The service overall needs to be ramped up for a hotel of this stature!", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cNeed to get their housekeeping service in shape\u201d", "Author": "Peroxide77", "ReviewID": "UR115360723", "Content": "Just as some of the other reviews, we had issues with their housekeeping service during our recent, 4 night stay here.

My girlfriend had worked incredibly hard to put this together so you can imagine her panic when they told her that our reservations weren't correct. After speaking to a few different people with firmness, the situation was finally resolved. 2) We arrived at 9:30am, We check our bags and hit the pool. A few of the other girls went to get bachelorette stuff for the suites. We were at the pool, our other girls came back to the suites and had their shopping bags sent up by the bell desk. Somehow, another bachelorette party's grocery bags ended up on our cart, and consequently, in our room. One girlfriend was upstairs to receive the bags, the other two were returning the rental car. So our friend proceeded to empty the bags of alcohol, mixers, flowers, decorations, etc. We also had a friend send items to the suite because she was unable to make the trip. Once the room was decorated, we all went up to the suite. When we arrived to the room I realized that our luggage was not there. 11 bags of luggage that, in 5 hours, never made it to our room. We called to ask them to send up our luggage. They told us our luggage had already been delivered. Trips downstairs and phone calls later, apparently our luggage went to someone else and was eventually found and brought to us. Whew, crisis averted.........almost. We were then visited by hotel security who told us that WE had received someone else's things. There was another bachelorette party who were missing bottles of alcohol, flowers, and a Valentino handbag. We had no idea what was ours and what wasn't, items had already been unpacked, we weren't together when the unpacking took place, people had been drinking, etc. The hotel security proceeded to scold us for not knowing what we purchased, they asked to search our suites, and they accused us of stealing this woman's handbag. They came in to our room with a receipt from the other guests, showing what they had purchased. It was 2 bottles of alcohol, and a bouqet of roses. We gave them back what was theirs, although we had already popped the bottles. Thank goodness they kept their receipts otherwise we might still be there trying to figure out who's stuff is who's. They came in our room 4 times over a four hour period. Caused us to be late to our dinner by an hour. It was verging on, dare I say, \"ghetto,\" treatment in a hotel that claims to be the new posh hot spot. The hotel should have gone to one of their bars, grabbed a couple handles of alcohol, sent one of their hosts to the flower shop, and been done with it. It isn't wise to turn a hotel's mistake in to the guest's responsibility. The Valentino bag never surfaced, and we don't know if it ever existed. Either way it doesn't really matter, they ruined a good portion of our first day. 3) We spent another $600 at dinner at Blue Ribbon. Some went to Marquee club, some headed back to the room. We walked through the pool area like earlier. Didn't know it was blocked. Club staff wouldn't allow us to go through- the club and the hotel are separate. He told us that it wasn't his job, he didn't work for the hotel. He was like much of the staff at that hotel, too cool to be hospitable. 4) Two of the girls found fleas on them in our suites because it is a dog friendly hotel- real swanky! 5) Our friend, a firefighter/EMT was taken in an ambulance from Marquee club because she fell asleep in a bathroom stall. They told us she was at the hospital, we went, she wasnt there. Hotel security/ club security dont communicate so we were looking for her until 7am. She finally convinced the EMT's to allow her to leave and this entire time nobody in the hotel could tell us where their guest, our friend was. 6) It took us a half hour to enter an elevator on Sunday. We were on the 45th of 46 floors. 6 elevators for all 46 floors? We finally got in, we stopped on every floor on the way down. As the doors opened to a full elevator- frustration. After a weekend of partying as people do in Vegas, NOBODY felt good about that experience. 7) Upon checkout, $2000 on 2 suites, we explained the unbelievable treatment we received and the guy proceeded to offer to comp a future room. We wanted them to comp the first day because they essentially ruined it, and frankly, we didn't want to go back there. He said he couldn't do that, and after almost an hour of \"negotiating,\" we finally left with $300 comp. 8) Metal stairs at Marquee club+ women in high hells+ short dresses=recipe for disaster. Hospitality seemed to be the last thing on the staff's mind, and much of our trip time was spent resolving issues. Went to Hard Rock and the people were cool AND nice.

We were Vegas virgins, and expected a high standard to round up the trip of a lifetime. We booked a Terrace Suite and took advantage of the 4 for 3 deal on their site, pre-paying the trip a good 3 months ago. This was easy to do on their site and calling the booking line from the UK. Upon arrival we were impressed, the parking was really easy with the lighting system overhead to guide you to available spaces. The weather in Vegas was hot so the garages were horrible and muggy but what do you expect! There was a line at check-in, we arrived at 2.30pm on a Monday, however it went down quickly and was painless. We did notice some domestic tourists just behindus complaining about the line however surely this is standard when checking into a hotel of this size at a peak time? We asked about the availability of an upgrade to a Wraparound Suite and was offered one for $75 per night, a bargain! The room was amazing, it was massive, there was a full kitchen, a HUGE terrace that overlooked the Bellaigio and Paris and the bed was seriously comfy. We loved being able to go outside and watch the crazy strip and the fountain display. We ate in the restaurants, and will review seperately and played in the casino. I had a half a day in the Spa, massage and manicure, whilst it wasnt cheap the service was great and the surroundings were clean, well thought out and not crowded or busy. We made the effort to visit many of the other casinos and hotels throughout the trip and I do genuinely believe the Cosmo is a bit 'different' to the others, it was about being cool, modern and funky, it didnt take itself to seriously. I would go back again tomorrow. If you are a Vegas virgin or a seasoned pro I would encourage you to give it a try, just dont expect opulent over the top 'french/russian chic' furnishings like you might get elsewhere, its more New York Loft style.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cSadly, I must join the chorus of those who say 'never again...'\u201d", "Author": "austintomtraveler", "ReviewID": "UR115254120", "Content": "We are Las Vegas \"regulars,\" traveling at least twice a year for four-day getaways. We have made it a point to stay at different hotels on the Strip so we have something to compare with. Years ago we started at Treasure Island, then have been at Paris, Venetian, Wynn, Encore, Bellagio, Aria and Vdara in our last visits. So we decided to make a family vacation over July 4 and chose the new hotel Cosmopolitan. Everything about the hotel seemed to be focused on maximizing the Las Vegas experience, so despite the mostly critical reviews we read only, we expected the most. Our flight to Las Vegas was delayed, so we called to let the hotel know we would be late. Since we had booked two rooms (one for us and the kids, the other for grandparents), we asked that even though we would be late that our request for adjoining or close rooms be honored (grandparents don't speak English very well). We were assured that would not be a problem. Though we were delayed, our flight was smooth and we arrived in our rental van at the hotel shortly after 9PM. We valet-parked, but a bellman wasn't available at the time, so we rolled our own luggage into the impressive lobby (no problem). The lines at check-in were OVERWHELMING! And there seemed to be no order. Some folks in the line at one end were checked in before those who had been there longer on the other end were. So we ended up waiting 45 minutes just to leave the line and start the check-in process. And it was the LONGEST check-in process I have EVER been involved with--and I have traveled extensively all over the world. Our agent kept typing and typing and typing. We mentioned that we had called earlier to inform the hotel that we would be late and that we had requested adjoining (or close) rooms. The agent said he doubted that would be possible because the hotel was near capacity. When we informed him that we had made that as part of our original request AND called in when our flight was delayed, the agent took on some sort of attitude that was hard to describe (other than \"don't try to push me around\"). We weren't trying to \"push him around\" but we had NOT (as online reviews suggested) tried to slip him $20 to get an upgrade. We just asked that our request be honored. That caused another 15 minutes or so of frantic typing by the agent. After waiting on line for 45 minutes and THEN spending nearly 45 minutes MORE in the actual process of checking in, we were told that our rooms WERE ON DIFFERENT FLOORS! It was now after 10:30PM and we had been traveling most of the day and were tired and hungry, so we just took our keys and took our own luggage up to the rooms (we didn't even try to find a bellman...but we weren't even asked if we wanted one). We left check-in feeling as if we really weren't wanted at Cosmo, so it was admittedly a bad start. While some have mentioned how nice their \"Terrace Suites\" were, we had booked a standard room. We got the grandparents situated in their room, which seemed nice in appearance, and headed down to our floor. As we walked into the room, we noticed that the carpet was damp (and water stained) outside the bathroom. But since we were in a \"pool view\" room, we wanted to see the view. We opened the curtains and noticed the dirty glasses on the ledge behind the curtain right away. (Makes you wonder what else in the room hadn't been cleaned!) I checked out the bathroom and noticed there was only a small shower stall until it hit me that we had been booked into a HANDICAP room! (We wondered if this was \"revenge\" by the check-in agent for making an issue of our request for adjoining rooms.) The shower stall had a small floor lip, but clearly water had leaked out into the hallway, which accounted for the damp/stained carpet. We had four in our party, but there were only two towels, so we tried to call Housekeeping only to discover that our PHONE didn't work. (The phone display said \"username and password\" required, and we hadn't been provided one at check-in.) So we called the hotel on our cell phones, only to get MORE attitude about why we were calling from an outside line to report a problem (\"Because the phone in our room doesn't work!\") We also wanted to get more towels. We were told that we had to request towels from the phone in the room and that they would send a technician right up to fix the phone. We waited fifteen minutes and then called the hotel again from our cell phone, only to get the SAME RESPONSE: \"why are you calling us from your cell phone---use the room phone!\" \"it DOESN'T WORK!\" They didn't have an expected arrival time for the technician. We said that we wanted to go out for a late dinner, and were told that if we left the room the technician couldn't enter and fix the phone. (We decided it was worth the risk to leave!) We stopped by the Concierge Desk in the lobby (the check-in lines at 11PM were still interminably long and we wanted to eat!) and let them know our problem. They were gracious and assured us that more towels would be delivered to the room while we were out. (They were. So Housekeeping can enter the room to deliver towels, but the telephone technician can't unless we are present....hmmmmm.) We went down to the Valet Parking desk on the lower level, where we had to scan our ticket to retrieve the car. There was something wrong with the scanner, so after a couple of minutes we asked, and our car was retrieved \"manually.\" Hey, sometimes there are technology glitches. We came back from dinner and actually had a decent night's sleep. The beds are comfortable! In the morning, the kid was the first to shower, and the entire floor was soaked because water came out from under the shower curtain, onto the bathroom floor and onto the carpet in the hall. So we used the hand towels and the bathroom rug to act as a dam. Then I tried to make a cup of coffee, only to discover that there wasn't any coffee for the machine in the room! So I took a shower next and walked down to the in-house coffee shop, where two cups of plain java set me back nearly ten bucks. By the time we had all showered, we were fed up with the room, so we went down to the lobby, waited on line again, and demanded that our room be changed. The morning crew was much more accommodating, and BOTH rooms were changed to adjoining rooms! Yes, we had to wait until the rooms were \"cleaned\" (and we weren't sure what that meant, given our experience from the night before), and that was fine with us. We decided to go out for brunch. We informed the Front Desk while we were there that there was no coffee in the room, and were informed that the hotel was removing those coffee makers from the rooms so they were no longer providing coffee. (Why not just unplug the coffee maker and remove it, rather than leave it there as if it was available for use?) The adjoining rooms? Good condition, seemed to be clean, no problems. The rest of the stay was okay, though that first 24 hours was SO rough that we all promised never to stay at Cosmo again. The other hotels on the strip have learned about customer service--something Cosmo seems to have left by the wayside as it rushed to fill its space with art while forgetting that the reason for being is PEOPLE!", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel in Vegas for 20-30 somethings...\u201d", "Author": "bta_icepick", "ReviewID": "UR115253239", "Content": "This hotel is certainly targeted to a particular market.

I so wanted to love this hotel and it failed to deliver :(. Yes, the common areas are beautiful. There's interesting art, architecture and surprises around every corner, but equal effort should be made towards hospitality. There is not enough staff to accommodate the volume of guests, so waiting in line for everything is par for the course. Housekeeping is barely existent. It's weird to walk down a hallway and never see a cleaning cart in action. On check-in, we asked about upgrading to a wrap-around terrace suite from a terrace suite. The front desk woman said it would be smaller than our original booked terrace suite. After informing her it was a larger room, she called back to the main desk and learned for herself that indeed a wrap-around was larger. Always nice to help educate the staff. Once we arrived in our room, it smelled funny and seemed dirty. I immediately saw our location was DIRECTLY above the Marquee Day Club/Night Club (Room 1902). The party was thumping from below and I expressed my concerns to the Bell Man, but was guaranteed it would be nice and quiet at 8pm. He failed to mention that the Night Club would start-up at 10pm and close down around 5am. After he left, we noticed food crumbs and lettuce on the carpet and in the kitchen area. There was also a \"mystery pill\" lying on the carpet in plain sight. There was trash on the terrace, crumbs on the tables and an overall funk about the place. We called housekeeping to come vacuum but they never came. We picked up the trash ourselves. In the meantime, my daughter Googled the \"mystery pill\" and discovered it was 200mg of Ibuprofen. Darn! I was going to need something stronger later....much later. As others have mentioned, many lights didn't work. In the second bath, two out of three lights were not functional and there wasn't even a toilet paper holder. I don't understand the point of the kitchen. There's a Meile stove, microwave, refrigerator, sink, and wine fridge, but not ONE plate or fork. If you are planning on using the kitchen as a kitchen, you need to make other plans. There are a few types of bar glasses, but you can't wash them as there is no soap and housekeeping sometimes never showed to replace the dirty ones. There's a fancy coffee maker, but no coffee. My husband asked the concierge about the lack of coffee and was informed they'll be taking the machines out of all the rooms. Our second room did not have a coffee maker. The second room was due to lying in bed in room #1 till 5am with cotton in our ears, alcohol in our systems, a few sedatives and pillows wrapped around our heads and still no sleep was possible. Loved listening to the DJ scream the F-Bomb around 12:07am 2:14am and 3:38am about how we're going to F-Bomb party all night. Oh, how I wished the \"mystery pill\" had been a ruffie to knock me out of my F-Bomb misery. Called the front desk at about 3:39am and informed them this would be our last night in this room. We'd be packing out bags and looking for a new pad far, far away from the Marquee in the morning. Husband went down a few hours later (it was already the morning) and got a long story from the front desk people about having to wait to see about occupancy, blah, blah..... When my night owl teens who can sleep through ANYTHING complained about NEVER sleeping the entire night, we went to the concierge and a new room was available immediately. Tip: If you are having problems, see the concierge. They are the only brains of the place. Room #2 was much better and there was even a toilet paper holder! Only one TV remote partially worked and the terrace ash trays were filled with cigarette butts, but overall, it was a huge improvement. It didn't even smell funky and all 3 bathroom lights worked! On a positive note, the bed was extremely comfortable. Must be the benefit of a new hotel. We used the Bamboo Pool, as it was in our building, and it was relaxing and pleasant. Service was mediocre to appalling. Prior to The Cosmo, we had stayed a week at a Four Seasons. This is the difference in service.....at a Four Seasons, you arrive at the pool and they immediately bring you a glass of water. At the Cosmo, you order a $14 cocktail and ask for a glass of water on the side and are told they are not allowed to bring water, only paid bottled water. If we want \"regular\" water, we need to go to the bar and get it ourselves. As always, we had a great time in Vegas, but this place has kinks. I suggest they had spent more time on creating an environment of service and hospitality, and less on how each book will be angled, knick-knack placed and a fancy lighting system which doesn't light.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albuquerque", "Title": "\u201cNew Hotel Way Overpriced!\u201d", "Author": "sportingreview", "ReviewID": "UR115218285", "Content": "This is a nice hotel with up to date rooms.

Positives: You must get a room with a view of the Bellagio Fountains....it is remarkable to sit on your balcony and view the fountain show....very relaxing and romantic! There is a big comfortable chair out there, so you can take a pillow and lay there and watch the show. The rooms are incredibly spacious, beds quite comfortable and the jetted tub in the bathroom with separate shower are great! The technology in the room is a little confusing at first, but then you figure it out and you can do anything (turn on/off lights, order room service, contact housekeeping, order extra pillows, etc....all from your TV). Also, there is a \"hello\" and \"goodbye\" light switch that turns on/off lights as you are coming/going (good energy saving features in the room). We found housekeeping, bell hop and front desk staff to be quite accomodating and friendly. Anna, our housekeeper, was very sweet and always made sure we had everything we needed! The Pools are fantastic, but we mostly stayed at the bamboo pool, as it is more relaxing and less \"club-style\". The Wicked Spoon buffet is a little expensive, but worth the money, as the food is fantastic and they offer a unique variety of dishes. The location of the hotel is fantastic, as you can easily visit other casinos, get to shopping, etc....We also liked the check-in/out kiosks in the lobby and the kiosks will print boarding passes for you as well. If you arrive to the hotel prior to regular check-in time, they will hold your luggage and give you a key so you can go to the pool (remember to pack a carry-on with your swimsuit and a change of clothes, etc...). Then, when your room is ready, they will automatically activate your key and call you via cell so you can head straight to your room once it's ready....NICE! Negatives: The \"kitchenette\" in the room has a microwave, small fridge, dishwasher and cabinets. However, they don't really want you to use the kitchen (they want you to spend all your money in their hotel which I understand but really?), so no dishes, silverware are provided, the fridge is totally stocked with drinks on sensors and there is no room for you to put ANYTHING in the fridge of your own. Additionally, they have no free coffee or tea and all snacks are also on sensors. My advice...go down the street to CVS and buy a styrofoam cooler for drinks, etc....and maybe get some cereal, milk, coffee and snacks to save a little money on eating out? Another negative is that there is no poker room in the casino. Big mistake, Cosmo! Not alot of shops in this hotel yet and there is some wasted space. They need to attract some more shops, perhaps an art gallery or something? Overall, I would say it's a little pricey at the Cosmo, but the views are awesome, the rooms are fantastic (other than the mostly useless \"kitchenette\") and I found the employees to be friendly and helpful. We have stayed at many hotels on the strip and this one had the best view plus the balcony space is great and it's nice to sit out there.

The Cosmo has everything you would expect of a new, high end hotel on the strip, great pool areas, good restaurants, you're right next to Crystals mall and the main club, Marquee, is the hot night spot in Vegas at the moment but I will pick out some selected pluses and minuses below. The Good: It's New: seems obvious to say but it's a big attraction to this hotel, everything is brand spanking new and looks great. Some of the other 5 star hotels are fading in their glory but this place is gleaming.\u00a0 The Rooms: I booked 6 nights in a Studio Terrace with Premium View. There's no debating that it is a great room - big bathroom, sitting area, two big TVs, comfortable bed, basically everything that you could require. The best bit about the room is the view from the balcony which overlooked the fountains at the Bellagio and the strip - the best view of Vegas I have seen, definitely worth paying for. The look and feel: the Cosmo gets away from the \"gimmicky\" Vegas casino design and attempts the \"classy\". In a large part they pull this off well, the reception area for instance is incredible but to be frank it is hard to make huge casino classy when it is rammed full of slot machines and if I'm honest I think the Wynn does a better job here.\u00a0 The Bars: If I have one criticism of the vast majority of Vegas hotels is that hardly any of them have a good bar where you can drop in for few drinks without watching sport, being deafened by loud music or feeling you are just sitting in the middle of the casino floor (which let's face it, you generally are). The Cosmo is different here, there's a bar right next to reception called Vespers and another at the other end of the hotel called Bonds which sit away from the casino floor and are cool places to drink. The Bad: The air con is not up to much in the rooms so if you like your room cold you're in trouble. At some points in my stay it struggled so much it was bordering on too hot, even though it was set at the lowest level. The service is still variable. It took me about 2 minutes to check out, at the same time it took my friend over 20 minutes because the system went into a melt down after the wrong button was pressed by the girl on reception. Check in was slow, probably 10 minutes for no discernible reason so if you check in during peak time you may get frustrated. Service in the bars and restaurants ranged from poor to excellent though out our stay. The Technology: The TV in the room does everything (temperature, room service menu, alarm, lights etc) which in principle is very cool and quite clever. The problem is it doesn't always work and my TV crashed multiple times during my stay which got a bit irritating. The Watch Outs: The View: When I arrived I checked my room was overlooking the fountains and found it wasn't as they classify the top floors on the opposite side of the hotel as \"premium view\". They changed it for me straight away but if you pay for the view make sure you get the right side of the hotel. The Minibar: in true style it is grossly over priced but like the rest of the hotel it's all automated. This meant that when I attempted to put my own drink in the fridge to cool down and knocked over a bottle of orange juice (which then knocked over everything else in the fridge in a domino effect) the hotel's systems instantly billed me for the entire contents of the fridge believing I'd removed everything. On check out there were no arguments and they charge was removed immediately but make sure you check your bill carefully as I had more than one erroneous minibar charge. Overall The Cosmo is a great hotel but the variation in service and experience let it down and as\u00a0customers feel variances not averages you have to be lucky to avoid the bad experiences here to make sure you have a fantastic stay. It's not disastrous stuff by any means but just enough that you walk away thinking that this could be a great hotel but at the moment just isn't fulfilling its potential. Would I return? I probably would as I back them to iron out the problems and make this the best hotel on The Strip which is what it should be but I wouldn't pay a fortune for the privilege.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201c6 Stars\u201d", "Author": "Trinkettes", "ReviewID": "UR115091526", "Content": "My husband and I were concerned about this hotel from the other reviews that we read. We hate loud noise at night and so we knew to avoid the east tower. I called the hotel several times to request the west tower, and luckily our reservation thru booking.com was for the west tower. We even had a fantastic terrace view (north I think) of Bellagio, etc. We were treated to the fountain show every night from our great vantage point. The room was awesome - that is why my title for this review is 6 Stars. My husband and I are world travelers and we stay at pretty high end hotels / resorts, so I do not say 6 Stars lightly. This room would go for $800 outside of Vegas. The design is beautiful - on the modern side, but that is what I like. We had a very comfy bed, and the tub was really unique (square shape with two seats). My only complaint was that the carpet needed to be vacuumed...I think the hotel is still working out some housekeeping kinks. I booked a bfast included package so we ate at the Wicked Spoon buffet every morning. It was great - big selection of food. Our favorite buffet used to be Bellagio, but now it is Wicked Spoon. We spent our days by the pool in the west tower. This is the mellow pool, not the party, loud music pool which is in the east tower. As per other reviews, you do have to get there by 10:00 am to get a chair on the weekends. We usually got there at 8:00 am to get our prime umbrella chairs. The pool will get very crowded, but that is typical of Vegas. The hotel's location is very convenient. We pretty much walked everywhere - easy access on the 2nd floor to Planet Hollywood for shopping. And we walked to Bellagio thru a walkway / stairs from the front of the hotel.

Even though there was a whole steak left on the plate the waiter never asked if we didn't like it or offer to take anything off for it (and this was after we'd waited almost an hour to get it).

We had to wait over 50 minutes for our luggage to be brought up to room which gave us time to look a bit closer at the room.. Was not very well cleaned in general with water marks on taps and shower.. Room it's self was not to bad size wise and was fairly trendy & modern.. Make sure you go for a room with the view looking up the strip.. Truly awesome view day & night..

I'm sorry if this seems wrong but but I was just not having this so I called reception to get this sorted.. They were not to helpful at first and kept using the excuse it was a very special wknd.. Finally we got to speak to a manager who again was full of excuses.. I explained how we had had nothing but long waits for any kind of service & the problems with the drunken loud college kids.. His response was to say \" you would not get a better or quicker service at any hotel when it is this busy\" I then pointed out that all the top end hotels we had been at had all been busy & had given us excellent service & suggested that if they can't provide the services they should take on more staff or not fill all the rooms.. After a few more excuses he said he we talk to room service & the kitchen & call us back straight away.. When they called I let my partner deal with things as I'd had enough..

We check trip advisor often for our vacations, and I must admit we were really worried about some of the negative reviews after we booked (we even tried to switch hotels but the offer was non-refundable). Luckily this hotel was fantastic. When we arrived and saw the decor of this place we were blown away. This really is a remarkable hotel (no wonder it cost $3.9 billion to build). At check-in they asked if it was our first trip to the Cosmopolitan (it was), and they upgraded us free of charge to a wrap-around terrace suite free of charge (I have a fifty dollar bill out when we checked in though). From there the trip only got better, but here is a breakdown of the basics: Location: Best on the strip (imho). It is right in the middle of everything. You can go north to Bellagio or south to Aria. Restaurants: All the places the are excellent with the buffet being one of the best in town (clean and tasty). Although you are gonna pay a lot for your meals. We averaged $130 for two people for almost every meal there. Service: Some of the other reviews said the staff were impolite, but we never got that feeling. Everyone was kind and willing to take care of your needs. Room: The room that we got upgraded to (the warp-around terrace suite) was the best room I have experienced in Vegas. It was in the east tower, fifty eight floors up, and faced both east and south (right on Las Vegas Boulevard). The view was so good you could stay outside all day. It did show some signs of use but nothing extreme. Also, it was 1200square feet (massive for Vegas). The only con was that you could hear some of the music from marquee night club, but if you are worried about noise this hotel is not for you. It is young and trendy. Pools: All the pools were good and you had three to choose from. The bamboo pool is for relaxing, the boulevard is the middle ground, and the Marquee day club is a straight party pool. Marquee Night Club: Very good club. Period. Great for house music (which I love) and Cosmic Gate was there when we went. We got a table with some friends that were in town and had a great time. Tables are the way to go. They are expensive but worth every penny. Our bill together for 6 people was $2200, but the service was worth it and we didn't wait in line at all. Spa: My fiance went and said it was really nice. I didn't go. Expensive again. All in all, it was a great experience. Some tips are to tip the front desk heavily for a great room, room service is cheaper than the restaurants (and planet hollywood is a 5 min walk with cheaper places to eat), and don't gamble there. Not worth your time or money. The table limits are high and Identity (the rewards program) doesn't give many points for gambling (only 10 points for every $100). Although I did make it to Identity gold in one trip which was a nice bonus. Also, the people that stay at this hotel are uptight and not very nice (they think they own the place), so watch out for that. I had this old fat guy yell at me at the craps table for making him lose money. NEWSFLASH, It's called gambling not winning, don't bet more than you can afford to lose. Still a wonderful trip though!

There was something about it that intrigued me and the images coming out of the construction process looked stunning. The idea of sitting in the middle of the strip on a terrace was exciting. We were not disappointed. In fact, this hotel ended up being an all-time favorite and this was certainly my the best trip to Vegas we've ever had. The Cosmo made this possible. We had a Wraparound Terrace Suite in the East Tower overlooking the Bellagio Fountains and Planet Hollywood on the strip, as well as a connecting One-Bedroom Terrace Suite overlooking the Planet Hollywood side of the strip. Combining the two rooms made for a stunning two bedroom suite. We were on floor 29, and while I wouldn't want to go much lower than that, the view was great. Pictures do not do the views justice. Sitting out on that terrace was the greatest experience I have had in all my trips to Las Vegas, and I made sure to do it several times a day. The fountain shows out on the terrace were great. Throughout our five night stay, the room was kept clean and the service was wonderful. I did not meet a rude employee. Everyone was nice, pleasant and helpful. The casino and common areas, as you would expect, look brand new. There is a really cool, hip vibe to this place. Another thing that photos don't do justice for are the video columns in the main lobby. Seeing those when you walk in is a stunning way to enter. The pools have a great vibe, especially the Boulevard Pool, which sits right on the strip four floors up. On Friday, Saturday and Sunday they have a DJ spinning and creating a great party atmosphere. The restaurants are also amazing. From eclectic fare like China Poblano and Jaleo by Jose Andres, to traditional burger joints like Holsteins, each restaurant has its own thing that makes it really special. These were my favorite restaurants during our stay. A word of advice: the \"hidden\" pizza place really is as good as people say it is. We are from the east coast, which has great pizza, and we felt like we never left home. In fact, this was better than most places in NJ. It was a great idea and this place seems to have customers at all hours. Even cooler, outside there is a common area with seating and a game area which includes a pool table. Like I said, this place is different and innovative in the way they have structured their common areas and their open spaces. A few things that could have been improved. These things did not ruin my experience here, but some other people might find these things annoying, so I feel compelled to mention them. At times, the hotel does have a lot of trouble with the TVs. I had to have someone come up and show me how to reset the TV when it went on the fritz. They said the menu for the \"connectivity panel\" that controls the iPod hookup would reset and be available within an hour. It never appeared again. Rather than call back, I just used the Sirius radio channels on the TV instead. I don't go to Vegas to watch TV, so this didn't really bother me. The TV worked fine anyway. It was just the connectivity panel that was acting up. At the pools, finding a seat can be a real problem. The first day, we were unable to find an open seat. After that, we came out earlier and also rented a cabana on Thursday. It's easier to find something at the smaller Bamboo Pool in the West Tower than at the Boulevard Pool in the East Tower. Both pools are a lot of fun and have a lot of different experiences in them in terms of sitting and lounging areas. Finally, I've seen many people complaining about noise coming through their windows from the pools and clubs. If you are in the East Tower, you will hear noise, especially if you are on the strip side. If there is a siren on the strip, you will hear it. I did not think the noise was unbearable, however. For me, it's part of the Vegas experience and the view more than compensates. If you want the best views, the East Tower is where you want to be. No question about it. It's amazing to me how many people book a room directly on the strip and do not expect to hear noise. Use common sense people. Or sacrifice the most amazing view in Vegas for something away from the strip. All that said, I believe this is the new #1 hotel in Vegas. I have stayed at The Wynn and the Bellagio and this place gets the nod, hands down.

I was told there was a room available and I would have to exchange the keys I was initially given upon check-in. I waited again in line and finally got the keys to my room in the East Tower. Four hours after I had arrived. By that time I had missed the scheduled seminars at the conference and was in a mad rush to get to the last scheduled event at the convention Center.

When I returned to the hotel, the music from the 17th floor pool or club, or whatever it was, was blaring and was obnoxious even on the 56th floor where I was staying. It lasted till about 8:00 that night. I asked for a wake-up call for the following morning which I never got, so was scrambling again to get to where I needed to be. The icing on the cake was the blaring music from the night club (on the 4th or 17th floor) till 4:00 a.m. the next night. Even on the 56th floor, my windows were practically vibrating from the base. I felt sorry for the guests on the lower floors. More strange service problems: a mop was left in my room when they cleaned, and maintenance was sent up to fix something that wasn't broken. When I complained to the manager about things, I got a lot of excuses and no genuine remorse. He did offer a $75 credit, although I told him from the start that this had nothing to do with money, as my employer was paying my expenses anyway.

Put simply this is a very good hotel with the potential to be the best value in Las Vegas given its location and newness. Pro's: Location Location Location: Unbeatable if you want to be in the centre of the action and have a great view. Good access to the Bellagio fountains, City Center and Miracle Mile shops at Planet Hollywood. Views and Balcony: A balcony in Vegas! Brilliant and with a room having a view of the Fountains I would argue there isn't a better view in the whole city. Access: Easy carpark access in and out of strip. If you stay in the East Tower most of the rooms are within 50 paces of the lifts and you are less than 100 paces to the strip from the lifts. For anyone who has hiked the miles of corridors and casino floor from other major hotels will understand how useful this is. Latest and Greatest: Most technologically advanced room I have stayed in. Not problematic either. Smart design that has real Vegas Style appeal to it. Cons: There were two major issues which in effect are 1. I booked over internet and speciically booked a premium view room expecting to get a view of Bellagio Fountains as advertised. Be aware that the upper floor rooms looking south (no Fountains) are also considered premium view rooms by the hotel - a laughable situation under any circumstances. Late night check in staff were also slow slow slow (ridiculously so) and when I specifically asked about the view of fountains room they failed to advise me of the no fountain view room and promptly stuck me in it. This at the time was a huge disappointment and a significant failure by staff. Fortunately a quick call was greeted with apologies and the next day I was transferred to new room with view of Fountains. Staff on his occasion (daytime) were much better. This entire negative could be simply resolved by clarifying \"fountain View\" over premium view. With this one exception I can't but praise the hotel. Fantastic view, location and access at a good price. Not the cheapest but surely one of the best for the average punter.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cArrogant check in staff, not 5 star service\u201d", "Author": "KandKOntario", "ReviewID": "UR114887205", "Content": "My husband and I booked for our anniversary through our travel agent.

We could not speak to each other without yelling. Back to the desk we go, and were offered an upgrade to the quiet tower (which we had already pre-paid in advance) for only $175.00 for EACH of the 4 nights. Unbelievable! They were offering us a downgraded suite with no balcony without financial compensation or pay an extra 700 dollars for what we were supposed to have! To make a long story short, a bell hop named Dan who came to carry our luggage during our downgrade to the quiet tower saved our stay.

Dont bother arguing with the extremely rude and arrogant staff as they will just tell you tough luck and have a nice day. Lana Le the Resort Manager is the rudest member of staff that I have ever encountered, she was unhelpful and very arrogant and I am surprised that a hotel of this standard employes her. Note to the GM of this hotel, your Front Office staff and general check-in is very bad and lets your fabulous product down. We had to stand in line for 30 minutes after flying 10 hours to get to Vegas and then the check-in process took 25 minutes and we were given completely the wrong information about our package. The rooms you can not fault, they are great and the bathroom is amazing. Again you are let down by the slack housekeeping (when they feel like coming) and also the noise. We had a room in the East Tower that looked over the Marquee nightclub and although we ourselves like to party, a break from the constant boom boom boom would have been nice especially at midnight to 5 am when you are trying to get some sleep or during the day when you fancy a break from the heat! oh and by the way, if you do want to go to the 'Day Club' (basically another pool in the hotel) you have to spend a certain amount on beverages and pay an extra $50 to use a sunlounger - yes in the hotel that you have already paid to stay in?!?!? On a positive note, the other pools, restaurants, bars and gambling areas are great and worked well for the six of us.

I'd been avidly reading Trip Advisor, and was very wary of all the bad reviews. On check in we were greeted by a very friendly member of staff. I started by saying that we would like a room overlooking the fountains. Unfortunately, the type of room we'd booked was not available on that side, but he immediatley offered us a one bedroom on that side at no extra cost. This would not be available for a while, and after reading that some people didn't get in their rooms for hours, we were reluctant to wait. Then he offered us an upgrade to a wraparound suite,which we had to pay a nominal amount for. We thought this seemed like a good deal, so said yes. Well all I can say is WOW! I've never seen such an amazing suite,with the biggest balcony which looked over 2 aspects. Everything about the rooms is of the best quality and finish. Our friends arrived the next day, and unfortunately didn't get offered the same deal, but their rooms were just as nice. The pools were lovely, we were in the East tower, so used the Boulevard pool most days. Be warned, it's not for swimming in. A large part of it is very shallow, you can lay and sunbathe laying on the bottom. In the heat of the day, this was a nice way to cool down. We were up early every day, but by about 8.45am, the free beds all round the pool were taken. It is possible to pay and reserve some of the beds, but I gather this is very expensive. One day this pool was closed as there was a band performing there that evening. This seemed a bit odd,they'd drained the pool by 8am, but we went to the Bamboo pool in the West tower instead. That was really nice, a little less space but a deeper pool. The whole place is stunning. The bars were beautiful, Bond, Chandelier ,Vesper all great. The Wicked Spoon Buffet was fantastic. It was also another perk of our upgrade to eat breakfast free there every day. It's well worth paying for though. We ate at Holsteins, which was great, but China Poblamo got the thumbs down. Quite small portions of some things, and that's unheard of in the U.S. in our experience,(we're from U.K.). Not good value, and a very confusing menu. I will definatley stay at the Cosmopolitan again. It's not too big, so has an intimate feel. I would also be happy to stay in the Westside Tower. It really isn't far from casino, and the pool is nice. One of our friends had not made sure to ask for a room not facing the Marquee Club, and they could here the music till late,although it didn't keep them awake. This is only a problem in the Eastside tower. We're all in our forties, and didn't feel out of place.

June. Reception was great, we were offered an upgrade at a reasonable cost and accepted. We explained that we had a late flight on the Thursday of leaving and our receptionist indicated that we could have the room until 1.30pm, which he noted, he further indicated that we should visit reception on the day of leaving to try and extend this. He also entered into the system that we were entitled to a complimentary breakfast each day. The hotel is very smart with a good deal of 'high tech'. Light switches are all over the place in rooms and not always easy to find which operates which light. The tv system also activates this function, but the handset would noy always work so it was a scramble to find the appropriate light switch. The room itself was well furnished and very comfortable, however, although we set the air con for 65 the lowest room temperature we could achieve was 75* - far too hot in the conditions. Breakfasts were very good again the hotel let itself down badly on service. On the last morning we had to queue for about 15 minutes as part of the restaurant was closed, when we asked why we were informed that the staff in that section were on a break. While I fully support staff comforts surely at 9.30am managers should ensure that the facility of a breakfast restaurant is operating fully. Certainly not a 5 star performance. Although it was acknowledged that our breakfasts were complimentary they had to be invoiced ane we were told that they would automatically be deleted from the bill at departure. On our last mornig I visited the front desk to enquire about a possible later departure. I was told that 12md was the latest possible. In view of what I had been told on arrival I asked to see a Manager. This person insisted that 1pm was the latest she was prepared to offer although she did say I could pay for another full day. She simply would not believe that I had already been informed of a later time on my arrival. In short she suggested I was lying. A more senior manager was eventually summoned, he insisted taht the hotel was full and thus he could not extend further [surprising when I had been told that I could pay for another full day]. His junior sttod and glared at me with utter contempt during the conversation, afact I commented upon at which her manager asked her to leave. Again My comments about agreements at arrival were disregarded, although when i promised further complaints our room was made available until 3pm. I was then directed to a series of screens to enable me to confirm flights/print boarding cards etc. - you've guessed it none of them worked. I treid to book out via the tv in my room, but this was not possible as the final bill was incorrect, yes the breakfasts had been charged. Still happily things got better weh I returned to reception. I was met by the person who had originally booked us in. He corrected evrything. He agreed with the original time that he had given me and insisted that it had been entered on the computer system he also confirmed that he had properly entered the complimentary breakfasts. I came away with the feeling that he was far better at customer service than his line managers who need some serious traning. Overall a smart.upmarket hotel the fabric is good but it is seriously compromised by staff who are prepared to treat customers with comtempt. We had use of a kitchen area but no knives spoons, plates etc were provided and we only discovered that these had to be requested from staff - pity no comment was made in the room via a notice or perhaps on the tv menu system.

So Tip1 - ask for a north or east facing room at the desk or at least above floor 29+ south facing if you're in the east side tower. I did ask for north facing, none available so got east facing. On reaching my room there was a big wet patch in the bedroom from the bathtub (leak / overflow?) TV had no picture, sound only and the blinds in the room were covered in dust. Called front desk and they were able to move me to another room within minutes and re-programme my keys remotely. So that was a good not to have to trek back to the front desk - plus points there. 2nd Room - TV did not work at all, it had just been unplugged - odd - but fixed myself. Otherwise the blinds in this room were also covered in dust. Tried to use the safe, it was locked. Called fron desk to report the problem -took 45 minutes to get someone to open it. So it took nearly 2 hours to check in and get myslef into a room. Fortunately it gets better from there and I had no futher problems. The rooms are very cool, comfy beds and overall (apart from the blinds) are well maintained. The best thing is the balcony - being able to sit outside and soak up the strip is the key selling point. The balcony is this hotel's key strength that no-one else has on the strip. The boulevard pool is great, terraced seating areas and a view of the strip, definitely one of the best pools on the strip. Manadalay Bay with probably never be bettered due the size/beach/wave machine there. But Cosmopolitan has done a great job. Bamboo pool is just convenient for the west tower, so Boulevard is definitely the one. The casino and bars are small but great and highly recommneded. Bond, Chandalier and Vesper are the better bars. Food is OK, ate at the Henry, Comme Ca, China Pobalano - nothing wrong with them, but nothing I could say was outstanding or a must try. The 'secret' pizza place is the best of the ones I tried, given than you can get a slice of great pizza and eat it on your balcony and soak up the atmosphere whilst the pizza is soaking up the night's alcohol.

The Boulevard Pool is fantastic and is directly above Las Vegas Blvd. We saw a concert at the pool one night, which was very memorable, and spent a few hours lounging in the pool one of the days of our visit. The service and ammenities were excellent. Conversely, I would not return to their Bamboo Pool. It is not nearly as well appointed and the staff on the day we were there were rude and inattentive.

The Cosmopolitan is the latest new shiny on the Strip, and so I had to book a trip and stay there to check it out, which I did in early June when they were running a special. Service (general) - I was most impressed with the level of customer service exhibited by all the staff I encountered within the hotel during my stay. Everyone had a very cheerful and sincere desire to assist, answer questions, and anticipate a guest's needs. The front desk clerk was very nice, and the area itself had a roving individual to direct traffic and soothe customers' impatience. The bell desk was extremely efficient; I was able to drop off after I had checked out and (more importantly) retrieve my bag almost instantly. Decor (general) - The Cosmopolitan was definitely going for a mish-mash of \"so wrong it's right\"; I would describe it as mostly quirky with some odd blah areas that may have been intended as a respite from the frantic weirdness but seem instead to need filling in. Purple appeared to be the dominant color. Some of the common areas, such as the elevators, upper hallways, and restrooms, are rather unremarkable and their colors tended toward brown. The elevators did have a digital panel that rotated between advertising and botany lessons. Stark neon tubing is present in one bar (Bond); mirrored columns in another (Vesper); and of course the piece de resistance, strands and strands of glass and mostly plastic beads tumbling over a three-story bar (Chandelier). Then there are the floors with the extreme type of art to (deliberately) catch the eye - statues of shaggy dogs and warriors with lion feet; paper art; Chinese tea sets; shoes for the 50-foot woman (including a Loubie). Group games (dominoes, pool, foozball) are available for anyone to enjoy. \"Cigarette\" dispensers that eject odd items like a tree seed are scattered about. Digital picture screens switched from nature portraits to \"live\" nude portraits (critical bits tastefully blurred out). I like. Check out the steampunkish telescopes at the second floor west-end elevators. Room I booked and received a Terrace Studio King. My request for the West Tower (being away from the day club/pool and more quiet) as well as a view of the Bellagio fountains was readily granted. The decor here seemed to be reaching for pop-ish modern in birch and blue, with jolts of orange and gold. A nice touch were the books randomly piled around the room for the guest to read. The wallpaper was more interesting in gold (sitting room) and black (throne room). The bed was very comfortable and there were plenty of pillows available in the chest at its foot and also in the closet. The closet itself had two suitcase racks, good quality hangers either in orange wood or padded; a good-sized safe; ironing board and iron; shoe horns; robes and (supposedly) slippers. The kitchenette area was nicely apportioned. The college dorm type refrigerator had the usual complement of \"move-it-and-you-buy-it\" liquids, but also allotted a full third of its space to the guest to use for his/her own stuff. Thumbs up. The microwave worked well. Plenty of cupboard space, but all were empty. The TV system in the sleep area was very responsive; I could adjust the temperature, set alarms, and research all of the hotel's amenities and book appointments at the spa and restaurants. A small glitch - my appointments did not show up through the TV on my daily itinerary as touted; but the appointments were indeed booked with each facility. The bathroom has a nice double sink, and a great tub with jets. The position of the TV in the sitting room would appear to be perfect for viewing while lounging in the tub, but the half-wall obstructs the view. The shower is large with a wide bench; the walls are in a bluish iridescent tile. The shower-head is OK but the space seems to cry out for a large overhead rain-spout type. The throne, as mentioned, has its own room. The bath amenities are of nice quality. The terrace had a great view of the fountains and the furniture there was pretty comfortable. Housekeeping - I can count myself fortunate I suppose; the room was cleaned every day. However, I would describe the cleaning as superficial at best. There were random instances that demonstrated there was very little attention to detail at work, depending upon the day and despite daily tips. The bed was made and the trash bins emptied, every day. But the dirty fingerprints that were present on the white bath door frame when I arrived remained a few days until, as a test, I easily removed them with a damp washcloth. The slippers also were not there when I arrived (although there is a labeled tray for them in the closet), and were never put in place. Towels, tp and the shower gel and (once) a dirty glass were not replaced, but the lotion and mouthwash were. The tub and a sink were not wiped down. Even folding the towels the same way so they at least lined up on the rack seemed too much of a chore. Not that I care about towels being dress-right-dress, even at a hotel shooting for five-star class, but the minimal effort shown especially in the bath room really highlighted the tendency to sloppiness throughout by the housekeeping staff. Gambling - I'll admit, I'm cheap. But I would still say that posting table limits during mid-week at (few) $15 to (many) $25 is pushing it. Especially when the Cosmopolitan's next-door neighbors (and direct competition), Aria and the Bellagio, condescend to have $10 tables. I did not see too many gamblers at Cosmopolitan's tables either. I played video poker instead; the non-progressive tended to give me descent play, but the progressive type was a money-sucker. Restaurants The Cosmopolitan has stacked two floors of its East Tower with the (now-expected) mix of ethnic and celebrity-chef offerings. The four I was able to sample (China Poblano, Comme Ca, Jaleo, Scarpetta) were very good to great in atmosphere, friendly service, and food. Spa The Sahra Spa and Hammam (a part I didn't see) was slightly above average. Since I received a great treatment, I would go again, but just for that and no other reason. Shops I did not buy anything at the Cosmopolitan (not even the t-shirt), but I'll give props to them for at least going with venues that are not elsewhere on the Strip, or in some cases even within the United States. I only hope their innovation doesn't fail and the location turn into another clone of every other mall on the Strip. I would definitely stay at The Cosmopolitan again, even with the housekeeping glitches and the insane (or hopeful) table limits.

The parking was straight forward, easy to identify free bays by the lights overhead. Checkin was easy, waited about 5-10 mins at 3pm, the agent took time to find a room with the view I asked for and even invited me around the other side of the desk to see the view I would have. Said the room I had been allocated was still dirty but I could have a room now if I was ok with being on the 27th floor instead of the 45th. He said if I take the clean room and I'm not satisfied with the view he would change it for me. Can't say fairer than that. Got to the room (wraparound suite) and it was amazing. Only slight niggle was a coffee stain on the balcony, I can live with that though! The view was amazing, having a balcony is a totally different experience in Vegas. I was in the Venetian the previous night with a room with a view, but was craving a balcony to take advantage of it! Had the standard minibar charges when I tried to checkout, they were removed without question. The agent came to greet me in the line and shook my hand too, nice touch. Suite was amazing as mentioned, pools were very nice too, had no issues getting a spot. All the staff I came into contact with were very pleasant. Tried the wicked spoon buffet too, that was just as amazing, lovely food, desserts to die for. As I was only there for one night I didn't experience the housekeeping, but I did chat to the checkin agent about it and he said it will take a hotel of that size a year to get everything right, which is fair enough. Also, they are pretty bug suites to be cleaning, so again, it's going to take a while to get right. I can understand that.

The reason we picked this hotel is they picked US. We received a promotion of 2 free nights and a month later another 2 free nights stay promo came in the mail... We combined the two and received a 4-night FREE stay at the hotel. Our friends received the exact same promotions. So we all stayed in 2 rooms for 4 nights. So I cannot complain about the cost of the room. The room itself was a terrace room with 2 beds and a view at the Bellagio fountains, great view but cannot hear music. The beds are comfortable with white sheets. One of our rooms was wheelchair accessible (they just gave it to us without asking). The shower was enormous with a seat in it and no window that looks into the room itself(will explain later). One negative: the bathroom door doesn't have a lock on it, so if you are staying with the kids, be aware. The other room was a regular room with a 5-foot tall glass separating the shower and the bedroom. Romantic if only a couple stays in the room. The glass has shades on it that you can roll up if you want to view your partner bathe him/her self. The room also features 1 flat screen on the wall and 1 phone by the bed. The desk doesn't have a phone on it. BEWARE - Wi-Fi is complimentary but only works in the room, NOT at the pool on the 14th floor. The staff will tell you that the whole hotel is wired but that is not true, they've been having issues with it since they opened up. No Wi-Fi by the pool. Food: we ordered room service once and regretted it. They only had one fish on the menu, salmon, and it was dry and cost us $40. Not worth it. Go to buffet!The buffet - we had it twice, once for Dinner and once for Brunch. Dinner was great, loved the little pots that the food is served in, lots of variety of desert, my favorite was cr\u00e8me Brule. But what's up with featuring Bone Marrow next to prime rib??? Looked odd and not appetizing. The Brunch was OK, not as great as dinner but worth the price of $22. No cr\u00e8me Brule though. Check-in process: fast but incompetent. We were checked in within 5 minutes but the front desk person didn't apply any food or gaming credits to our account, so we had to spend 15 min at the identity desk, where they screwed up again with linking our room keys to our identity cards... Housekeeping: They forgot to clean our room one day and that day someone showed up at 10pm to clean it, we sent them away because we were about to go to bed. The amenities like shampoo, conditioner weren't my favorite, spicy. The soap was great. Parking was no problem, plenty of it with cool green lights indicating available spaces.Also valet is free, but never used it.The pool was crowded, impossible to find a spot.Overall, for a free stay it was a nice one.

The water pressure in the rooms is weird and comes and goes as you are trying to shower or brush your teeth - annoying. We went to the pool the following day and it was nice.

We got back to our room around 4PM and it still hadn't been cleaned - we called and asked for it to be done and then left for awhile. We came back to a clean room - yeah! And we had a bottle of champagne delivered from the front desk - very nice! We had tickets to get into Marquee that night but when we arrived the wait was at least an hour and we were hotel guests.

My husband called before we booked online and they gave us a \"group rate\" with a special link to send to our friends for easy online reservations.

First off, this is NOT the best hotel on the strip, let's not go overboard reading other people's reviews that may have only stayed at the Hooters Hotel before the Cosmo. The fact is, this is a very nice new resort in Las Vegas, and like most new hotels that open, there is a lot of 'buzz' going around for everyone to take a look. The Good: Well, it's new. How can you complain about everything that's brand new and clean? This property does a nice job giving a fashionable twist to the hotel rooms, with interesting decor, books and probably the best part to me, the spacious bathroom and shower. The Wicked Spoon Buffet is not like any traditional buffet that is so cliche in Las Vegas. The food quality for breakfast was excellent. Oddly enough, the traditional breakfast fare is not found here, but the Wicked Spoon does a nice twist offering pizzas, roast beef, an international bread and cheese board, caesar salad and asian food to their morning fare. The staff are certainly more pleasant and 'sort-of' more organized since my first stay a few months ago. The So-So: Well, the check-in process is still slow and a little disorganized with a free-for-all line-up developing to find a check-in spot. The ropes they have serve no purpose and a stanchion set-up would be better. The crowd is still 'typical Las Vegas'. If you're coming thinking this is drawing a high-end clientele, well, I'm guessing you'll be disappointed. This property is no Wynn/Encore, nor is it the Mandarin. It finds a nice niche with those upgrading from the Treasure Island, to the curious ones that want to come 'be seen' at the restaurants and clubs, loiter around the lobby, etc., but are probably staying at the Imperial Palace. Overall, it's a nice hotel. I'm not sure what audience they are really after. A good gamer is going to play at the more established haunts of Bellagio, Wynn, Caesars Palace. Those looking for great service and amenity will definitely consider the above as well... even Aria has a leg-up on Cosmopolitan. The Cosmo is definitely a cool place to go to see and be seen and it's an upgrade from staying at lower-tier properties. Again, the rooms are very cool and the dining options very good.

We had an early flight so got to the hotel around 1:30pm, I was concerned as I had read reviews here that even checking in at 4 and 5pm rooms were not ready. Well there was a line up but there was a line up person that told you what line to stand in and she moved us around a few times to make it go faster and in about 5 min we were checking in. We were given an upgrade to a one bedroom suite on the 58th floor overlooking the strip! I have been to Vegas close to 20 times over the last 15 years and have stayed almost everywhere and this was by far the best place. Of course it is new so it has that going for it, but what I loved most about the room was it had a sliding glass door with a huge balcony. Anywhere I have stayed in Vegas you could not open a window more than an inch and could never get any fresh air, this was a big nice change! I have read all the reviews stating poor wireless internet, my room had wireless as well as plug in and both worked fine, everything worked fine. My wife had an issue after they made up our room the second day as they did not leave a new soap and the toilet paper was low but not out but no backup roll. I made a call to housekeeping and in under 5min a gentlemen was at our door and handed me a bag of toiletries that would last 4 people for 2 weeks! Now this hotel does have a different feel than others in the sense it is a younger crowd (under 40) and seems to be more about drinking, eating, chilling out and partying over gambling. For restaurants we ate at Henrys for breakfast one morning, not cheap, but very good. I also found the secret pizza place 2 times and I am a pizza person and would say one of the best I have had. Other than that we did not eat at any other restaurants but they all looked nice and I will be back to try them. We spent a few hours at the pool that overlooks the strip and it was a party atmosphere with beautiful young people and good music, I wish I had time the next day to have gone back. My wife and I did use the fitness center, now there is a $15 charge for this but there is no charge for internet so it was a wash. Great fitness center with fruit and newspapers from around the nation and all the equip you would need, nicer than our local gym at home.

Ask for the west end building since the east end has the club below and can be noisy. Location is central in between Belaggio and Aria, there is a walkway to both of them and Crystal the nouveau riche shopping mall- nobody was buying, just walking. Elevators on both sides were great and accessible. It may be small in front but for me it is big in terms of location, accesibilty and practicality.

We try out the new ones every time, and we've never been as disappointed in a hotel as we were in Cosmo. Granted it was a long weekend and they were extremely busy, we had the most horrible house keeping and service you can imagine. First off, compared to all of the newer hotels, Aria, Vdara, Mandarin Oriental, Cosmo has to be THE worst, especially when it comes to the quality of their decor. In our room, one of the lights didn't turn on, the toilet seat was broken and one of the drawers wouldn't close. Next, let's talk about housekeeping. Have you ever been to a 5 star hotel room with no slippers? We also compared our rooms to the others, and some of theirs were missing too! Also, by the our third day, we ran out of soap and shampoo, and nobody came to replace them. Another thing!! There were stains, visible white stains, on the comforter, and the desk! And now, the ULTIMATE thing that REALLY upset me. Our room was the last corner room of the floor (don't remember which floor), and when we first checked in, the room smelled like cigarette smoke. We told front desk, and they sent someone to spray an OZONE SPRAY that supposedly will remove the spray. That's fine, not your fault, if you can fix it, I don't mind. Then we come back to the room a few hours later, the SAME SMELL IS STILL THERE, if not MORE intense. So we called again, they said the same thing, they'll send someone up to spray our room again. When we asked to change rooms, they said they were full, and there's nothing they can do. This happened five times; us calling, them spraying, and not once did our room NOT smell like 20 people smoking at the same time. And it only got worse! It was the worst at night when we were asleep! The AC would stop, and it seemed as if the a/c vent was releasing strong gushes of warm cigarette smoke into our room.

We called down to reception and were told they had no more of these rooms available. We told them we had been waiting since 10am and the room booked 3 months before they opened. They called us back and offered us a free upgrade to a terrace suite overlooking the fountains. That room was fantastic, brilliant view of the fountains (we watched every show!!). The Japanese soaking tub was brilliant and it was great to sit in there with a drink and watch the fountains. The bed was comfortable and all the lights and heating could be controlled through the TV.

The hotel is amazing. Very modern and full of glamour. The best hotel on the strip I'd say. It's right in the middle of everything. I can't understand why there are all the negatives reviews on here. We had no problems at all. Check-In was very quick, no queue, and the check-in girl was lovely. We even got upgraded. The room was amazing. We were in the West Tower in a 1 bed terrace on the 27th floor (room 2735). It had 2 bathrooms, one with a huge sit in bath and walk in shower. There was a small kitchen with a coffee maker and microwave. There are mugs but no plates/cutlery. They do give you a tea/coffee pack but you have to pay for it ($7), so I'f bring your own if you can, otherwise there is a supermarket about 5 mins away. It had a separate seating area with it's own tv and a small screen to separate it from the bed, which had another tv. (Photos added). We had a balcony that overlooked the Bellagio fountains and strip. Noise wise, I think the West tower is better if you like quiet. I heard a few people complaining about the noise from the nightclub and they were staying in the East Tower. There are 2 main pools. The Boulevard Pool on the 3rd floor and the Bamboo Pool on the 14th floor. Both have the wow factor. The Boulevard Pool is bigger and has several different seating areas and separate pools. It's more of a party atmosphere here. They have tv's and table tennis to keep you entertained. The bamboo pool is smaller but has some wicked giant showers. This is quieter than the other pool, so if you just want to chill out I'd recommend this one. However, it can get quite windy as it's higher up. As for the restaurants, we only tried a couple in the hotel. We had the Breakfast Buffet in the Wicked Spoon ($22 each). Very nice and lots of choice (hot & cold). We tried Jaleo which is a Spanish Tapas restaurant. Very good and they serve the dishes in funky containers, such as shoes. We also tried China Poblano which was a new experience. It's not your usual Chinese restaurant. It's a Chinese/Mexican tapas style. Very tasty though. We also visited the Va Bene Caffe Coffee shop several times. Great coffee/tea and they sell croissants/pastries/sandwiches etc, which is great if you just fancy a light breakfast. Bar wise, the Chandelier is a must. It has 3 floors, all serving different cocktails. Note: The middle floor is a smoke free zone. The Bond bar is also good and they have dancers in the evenings. The book & stage is also good and they often have live bands on. We didn't try the Marquee Nightclub, but Saturday and Monday seemed to be the best nights. Big queues and lots of people. The casino is not the biggest on the strip, and if I am honest I'd say there are better casino floors in other hotels (if you want atmosphere), such as the Bellagio, but it's very modern. Other points: The cleaning service was fine. They came everyday. The hotel has free Wi-Fi. Room service is a bit slow. Room floors can only be accessed by hotel guests. You need to use your key in the lift to get to the floors. Hairdryer in the room is a proper size one (not one of these travel ones). There is a Bus stop for the Deuce Strip bus just outside.

Although we are very familiar with most of the Strip hotels, this one was unlike any other that we had visite d. We were immediately surrounded by sights that amazed and astounded us. There were bright colors\u2026.LED screens that projected bubbles and moving geometric patterns\u2026futuristic furniture. We felt like we\u2019d stepped through the looking glass with Alice. Suddenly I was surrounded by a pack of giant stone dogs. In my effort to escape, I ran smack into an 8-foot patent leather shoe! Things just kept getting \u201ccuriouser and curiouser\u201d. We wandered down a hall and came upon a standstone oasis with mystifying sand sculptures and an enchanting moonlight canopy of stars overhead. In an effort to find some normalcy, we headed back toward the center of the hotel. But even there we encountered an unexpected sight. We craned our necks, along with other visitors to see what turned out to be a 3 story Swarovski crystal chandelier. Wow! Where were we? We were at the Cosmopolitan, the newest addition to the City Center complex. Unlike any of the other major resort casinos on the Strip it does not boast a central theme. It is a completely unique experience. The artwork and design elements reflect their commitment to whimsy and creativity. The hotel has a modern, urban vibe with multi-story windows that allow lots of natural light, which is not commonplace in most of the Strip properties. We were treated to a guided tour where we were able view each of the room and suite types that include a Terrace Studio, Terrace Suites and even a Lanai Suite. Each was well appointed, beautifully furnished and many offered panoramic views. Our favorite was the Wraparound Terrace Suite that featured a 480 square foot private terrace, a modern kitchenette with microwave and refrigerator and even a washer/dryer. Talk about a home away from home. That sandstone oasis was actually the Sahra Spa & Hammam, a full-service spa with a reimagined steam room, heated hammam, personal rejuvenation suite and holistic body treatments. In recent years Las Vegas has been touted as a \u201cfoodie\u2019s paradise\u201d. The Cosmopolitan excels in this area as well, with a restaurant collection like no other on the Strip. China Poblano showcases Chef Jose Andres\u2019 personal take on Chinese and Mexican cuisines. Noodles and tacos come together in a festive, stylish setting. Scarpetta offers modern Italian fare. Holstein\u2019s is an exciting new burger concept with an emphasis on fresh, natural and organic ingredients. The signature burger is the Gold Standard Burger, a dry aged beef burger, smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic-chive aioli. I thoroughly enjoyed a turkey burger complete with dressing and cranberry sauce. There are creative appetizers like street tacos made with shredded duck confit, foie gras and truffle crema with cranberry relish. If we\u2019d had room for dessert we would definitely have tried the Lollipops in lemon meringue, red velvet cake, brownie, blondie or strawberry cheesecake. True to Las Vegas style, the Cosmopolitan has a buffet. But true to the Cosmopolitan style, the \u201cWicked Spoon Buffet\u201d is a unique culinary experience. It blends familiar staples with imaginative dishes. The entrees are presented in single-serving portions. Of course diners can take as many as they like, but the small servings make it easier to sample many dishes without wading through mountains of food. The food was so unique that we had to eat there twice during our stay to make sure that it was as good as we thought \u2013 it was. We gorged ourselves on dishes like ricotta cream spinach with whipped ricotta and a parmesan panko crust and mac and cheese with smoked ham hock and fontina cheese. The meat carving stations were a carnivore\u2019s delight. An indescribable selection of desserts included fresh seasonal berries, house-made gelatos and sorbets, specialty candies made in-house and of course staples like cr\u00e8me brulee, tiramisu, and other petit fours. The nightclub scene is unique The spectacular Marquee Nightclub opened to rave reviews on New Year\u2019s Eve 2010 with a performance by Jay-Z. The venue is more than 62,000 square feet with 50-foot-tall ceilings and an unparalleled multi-million-dollar sound stage that has to be seen to be believed. It draws a non-stop celebrity clientele. In the warmer months, the Marquee Dayclub is a daytime entertainment choice complete with three-story Bungalow Lofts, a cabana, living quarters and a party deck on top, with lots of eye candy to enjoy. That 3-story crystal chandelier that we saw in the hotel centrum has been described as a \u2018living, breathing architectural wonder created by luminous beaded curtains of light.\u201d There are lounges on each of the three levels that allow patrons to enjoy a libation along with the artistry of the Chandelier. Of course there is shopping. The Cosmopolitan has the most eclectic collection of shops on the Strip with stores like Stitched, Jason of Beverly Hills and even the CRSVR Sneaker Boutique that specializes in limited edition sneakers and men\u2019s and women\u2019s casually dressed up fashion. As we took in all that the Cosmopolitan has to offer, we realized that this was not a dream. This is just the latest example of how Las Vegas continues to evolve. We were once told by a savvy cab driver that one needs to visit the Vegas at least once every 4 months just to keep up with the evolution of the city.

My only suggestion would be to make the coffee and tea in the room complimentary - even though the cost was minimal, it would have been a nice touch.

What hits you most is hundreds of draped crystal streamers cascading 3 levels down into the casino floor. There are literally thousands of crystal beads providing lots of bling. If you're not interested in the modern art, follow the signs up the escalator to the Overlook Pool and bar and enjoy a different view of the strip from there. We did not need to have a hotel key to access this area and was able to explore 2 of the 3 pools. Entering the Overlook pool walk over to the opposite side to the window edge where you can look out to the Strip in both directions. The nighttime view of the strip from this area would be awesome. If you continue to explore the pool area following the signs to the Bamboo pool, the route takes you up some stairs and around the sunbathers to the side of the building where you can get a view of City Centre. The Bamboo pool area provides a quieter lush area away from the Overlook pool. Retrace your steps to exit your exploration and return down the escalators to the casino. As with all casinos, self-parking is free with an added parking feature in the garage with electronic signs indicating the number of open spaces on each level along with red and green lights over each parking space to indicate whether the space is free or occupied.

Helped us with an upgrade to a 1bedroom terrace with a view of yhe bellagio fountains...to die for!! Loved the balconies!! Watched the sunrise almost every day!! The restaurants were very good..reasonably priced for Vegas as well... We had a large group and went to marquee day club pool and rented a grand cabana for 1000 which was entire food and beverage credit!!! Super great deal if you have a group of people. Careful though...super strong drinks!! Haha!! I have noticed a lot of comments that this resort \"caters\" to the younger crowd...I tend to disagree...although there were a lot of young people there, I felt our needs were met equally as good!! Never felt out of place once!! We are very young minded mid 40's The only downside to this resort is the marquee nightclub. It is the number 1 club right now in Vegas...so if you don't like crowds or very very loud music, don't be anywhere near the cosmo on a sat night!! I, who never says no to a great party, hated the sat night scene. We got into the club, but should have had the foresite to order bottle service...otherwise waiting in very long lines for over 1/2 hour, and not for lack of bartending service...it is just that busy!! So basically what I am saying is I loved everything!!

We had see the Cosmo while it was still under construction last September and we noticed the balcony's that looked over the Bellagio Fountains - and we said we are definitely trying this place out when it opens. It opened in December 2010 to mixed reviews - we got a fantastic flight/hotel package from Detroit with Delta and decided to try it out in March. We have been to Vegas 4 times, having stayed at THEHotel @ Mandalay Bay and Caesars Palace so we know the ins and outs and what we expect from the hotels. My husband and I are in our late twenties and we visit vegas to relax, to go to cool restaurants and gamble. The Cosmo hit all of our wish list!! We arrived at about 5:30 and we waited in line for about 10 mins before a super friendly attendant checked us in - I had reserved a Terrace One Bedroom Premium View - I requested a mid-floor East tower room overlooking the fountains and that is exactly what I got! The room was beautiful, modern, spacious, clean. The bathroom with the walk in shower and soaking tub with a view of the fountains was unreal!! The bed was comfy and the balcony was everything I had hoped for! Throughout our stay we ate at several of the cosmo restaurants - Wicked spoon for breakfast, room service for breakfast, Holsteins for lunch, hidden pizza for lunch and snacks, DOCG and STK for dinner. All of them were fabulous - absolutely no complaints! But STK was my absolute favourite, we will be back to eat there (i will do a seperate review for the restaurants). I visited the spa - the pedicure was great and reasonably priced for vegas. The casino was clean - the Chandalier bar is crazy! Its a beautiful centre focal point for the hotel. My husband didn't find the casino tables to pay, but i did well with slots. I played a few hours at a single machine one night and the waitress was amazing - she kept the wine coming!! We did incur the mysterious mini-bar charges on our folio but one quick call and they were removed without incident - otherwise we were problem free. We even requested a late check out as we were flying a red-eye home and were given until 6pm at no charge! We are already planning a return trip for September - I cannot wait to go back. The identity membership program has paid off for us - so don't forget to register. And lastly, after reading previous reviews and having visited the cosmo now, i only have one word of advice - if you love the bellagio or the venetian than you likely won't love the cosmo. The atmosphere and vibe is younger and modern - which is why we love it! If I wanted overdone and gaudy I would stay at the Bellagio - so don't write negative reviews because the atmosphere is \"too modern\" or \"too young\"....the Cosmopolitan is meant to attract a different clientele - and thats what makes it great!", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cVery spacious\u201d", "Author": "dcoldsmith", "ReviewID": "UR113114504", "Content": "Stayed here for our first trip to Vegas.

I ended up getting three hours of sleep and had to do a business presentation that morning.

Fresh flashy contemporary decor and paired with new technology. Other hotels will need to catch up and invest significant dollars to ever be on par with this one. During my stay in May 2011, The Cosmopolitan was the newest hotel on the block. The lobby had interesting \"LED pillars\" and I was amazed at the big chandelier where everyone posed to take pictures. There was a very interesting blend of old and new interior design motifs.The public areas had a lot of red and black colors but when I checked into the hotel room, it was decorated in calmer tones and were also comfortably furnished. Although I had a city room without the balcony, I found it very spacious for two people. I do ponder about the hazards of having hi-rise balconies in Las Vegas where there are often intoxicated guests whose impairment may stem beyond the effects of just alcohol. Might they just \"fall off the balcony\"? My only complaint about my hotel room in the west tower was that they had not yet wired the room for television yet so I had no cable TV. Wasn't a big deal as I did not come here to watch TV. And there is free internet. The desk electrical and AV plug-ins to the TV are a real bonus: HDMI, VGA, iphone/ipod, network cable, USB charge, S-Video, Video in/Audio-in. Now for the bathroom...no bathtub here but there is a roomy standing shower with one side of glass that sees through to the bedroom (you can pull down the covering if you don't want everyone else to see you). Toiletries provided were from C.O. Bigelow Apothecaries. I visited the Bamboo Pool and the Boulevard Pool. Both were quiet and serene since I got there early. But there aren't too many chairs so they can very well fill up fast on a weekend. I also visited the Marquee Night Club on Thursday night but only one floor was open. For dining, I recommend Comme Ca and The Wicked Spoon Buffet. One morning, I actually also had a very pleasant surprise with my excellent breakfast from the room service menu.

We phoned down numerous times and spoke to a variety of staff who said it would be delivered, but it never was. Housekeeping was dreadful. During our 4 day stay they cleaned the room once and even then it wasn't great. They did however find time to come in and remove our coffee maker; which was a bit of a puzzle that never really got sorted out (or returned). The pools were wonderful and the staff at them attentive and friendly. The store \"Eat and Drink\" was amazing and the staff Lorenzo and Jim deserve Kudos for being so friendly and helpful.

Both times my reservation was totally screwed up. I specifically reserved a terrace room, 2 beds. When arriving was told not available. Also, I booked this trip in response to e-mail invite to 'spend 2 nights', which led me to believe the nights were comped, as my first visit was. Was told, no, fine print is you get a mystery discount. Booked trip anyway because it was a gift trip for my sister. I was given runaround for over 4 hours waiting for a room. Finally got a room at about 5 p.m. after waiting all afternoon. I believe this is a trick to get you to spend time in casino. Was treated very poorly and frankly as beautiful as the hotel is I will not stay there again. I spend 2-3 nights a month in Vegas and prefer Venetian, Paris or Caeser's Palace compared to treated given at Cosmopolitan. Room was also poorly cleaned while there. No amenities, no ice bags, beds thrown together. I was appalled at the price I paid. Ridiculous. I hope you will consider other options before going to Cosmopolitan, unless you like being treated like a commodity and feel like they are doing you a favor by your being there. Very very disappointing. Also requested room close to elevator to accommodate my sister's limited mobility. We were given the last room at end of hall furthest from elevator. I believe they did this on purpose because they knew I was so frustrated I wasn't going to push it further, I was worn out by then and embarrassed that my sister's gift trip was totally spoiled.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwich, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cChic and Sophisticated\u201d", "Author": "lynnhill99", "ReviewID": "UR112467377", "Content": "Just back from a 6 night trip to Vegas and was really worried that Cosmopolitan would not be as expected. Been to Vegas before a few years ago, but it has really changed. Cosmo hotel is in the heart of the strip and was just so glad we stayed here, if we had not I would have been gutted! Its slick, chic and very sophisticated. Very modern with the most amazing rooms (balcony terrace 1 bed room ) upgraded from our booked studio terrace (you need a terrace!!!) Yes some of the staff were grumpy especially in wicked spoon restaurant (definately need some customer service skills) but hey its just funny when you are holiday. Everyone knows you have to tip in the states, but my god they were absolutely disgusted if you left a 5 dollar tip for breakfast. Sorry but the guys dont do anything other than forget to bring juice, coffee instead of tea, then the wrong type of tea (dont do early gray) and then almost throw the tip on the floor. The breakfasts were however very very good, especially the guy doing the eggs/omletts, he was very helpful. The hotel chill out bamboo pool was really nice and the bar staff very chatty, the girls in bikini's were interesting and very friendly (big tips) We ate at the Italian and again great food. Overall the hotel was just so very good, very impressive and modern which was more our style than some of the older more fuddy duddy hotels. Would recommend the hotel and like I said I would have been very disappointed to have stayed somewhere else. Rock Bar over the road great for beers and music as you can sit outside which feels more like being on holiday as most of the bars etc are inside the hotel and take so long to get to. The hip and happening Marquee night club and day club at the Cosmo seemed to be incredibly popular, we did not go but they were all in the que for around 2 or 3 hours (hotel guests get in priority) some days there were lines and crowds waiting from around 10.00am in the morning til 6pm for the day club, then from around 8pm til late for the night club. When we were there many famous dj's during the day and night, was so different not really experienced anything like it before. Overall very good experience, good check in and check out, although you do have to wait. Funky reception and bar areas all throughout the hotel complex.

Let me begin by saying that I was a bit concerned after reading some of the reviews of the attitude of the staff of the Cosmo. Let me state without any reservation that EVERYONE at the hotel, from hotel staff to casino staff were of the highest standards of helpfulness and friendliness. Our flight arrived from San Antonio very early in the morning. We were at the empty check-in line at 8:30 a.m. and were greeted by Ali. He was very helpful and was able to meet our request for a Bellagio view in a quiet area immediately. We went directly to our room (3721). The room was spectacular! Great view of the fountains! We found the room to be exactly what we needed and the cleaning staff took great care of us during the entire stay. After checking out the room, we went to the brunch buffet. I am not a fan of buffets, but this one was great. Of course, it was all you could eat and included an alcoholic beverage. The price was $22 plus tax which is very reasonable for the amount of quality food you could get. Our gambling sessions found all of the dealers to be very, very friendly. Never had one problem with one staff member. The one thing negative that I would say about the room is that there is very little storage area in the bathroom and the closet has very little room for anything but hanging clothes. Most of our stuff stayed in the suitcase and we just removed things as we needed them. We each had a massage and the spa is nice, although probably not as nice as Caesar's, but it was very relaxing and, again, the staff of the spa was incredibly helpful. The pools are beautiful and we ate at the restaurant which overlooks the main strip pool and the food was good. We will be back to the Cosmopolitan, I think it is our new home on the strip.

In the West Tower. It was perfect - overlooking The Bellagio Fountains. I had read about people saying the hotel was noisy but our room certainly wasn't so perhaps a request for that side of the hotel would help people worried about potential noise. The balcony was a wonderful experience and the room was gorgeous. We had two bathrooms so I was spoilt for choice, The bed was brilliantly comfortable and I liked the fact that the lighting and climate controls were all on the TV - very high tech but easy to use. I have read quite a few reviews with people saying they felt old as the hotel is full of youngsters - well my husband is 58 and I am the wrong side of 40 and I certainly didn't feel that way. I used the Bamboo Pool every day and I was there by 10.00 each day and had no problems getting a bed . It does fill up quite quickly and the sun does disappear so you are in the share after 3.30 but 5 hours was enough sun each day for me. I didn't visit the other pools as I don't like the whole clubbing scene so can't comment on them. It's a shame the room doesn't have a free coffee maker ( you had to buy your coffee at $9 per pack) - but it was great that it had a fridge that you could put your own drinks in as well as one of the automatic 'lift things out and you get charged' mini bars! The toiletries were lovely lavender and peppermint. As we had flown in from a road trip in California we loved the fact the room had a washing machine and dryer so we could clean all our clothes. Room service was quick and efficient and check in wasn't too bad. Check out on the Friday was terrible though - really long queues so in the end we went back up to the room and did an automatic express check out via the TV which I don't normally like to do but needs must. Free quick Wi-Fi in the room was also a delight - although I suppose it's not really 'free' as it's part of the resort fee that the hotels in Vegas all now seem to charge. The casino itself was fun - although we didn't seem to win anything but don't judge it on us as we're not that lucky! One gripe which may seem silly but was important to me is that they don't give out free iced water at the pool - you have to buy bottles which is a really stupid policy. My pictures really don't do it justice - I must get a better camera! I would definitely stay there again and don't listen to all the old people moaning about the hotel - it was fun and trendy and you are only as old as you feel", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "mukilteo", "Title": "\u201cWonderful - we will return!\u201d", "Author": "MukilteoOtto", "ReviewID": "UR112110457", "Content": "Wonderful hotel!

The first time I stayed, I had broken glass in my room and it took 2 days for housekeeping to clean it up. The hotel did offer a credit to compensate for the lack of service, but I'd rather NOT have broken glass in my room. This time around, they sold out of proper rooms and we were put in a conference room with an uncomfortable Murphy bed. I booked a room with 2 queens months in advance, so they offered a complimentary roll away bed, however, I'd rather have the room I booked and paid for with 2 comfortable queen beds. The murphy bed and the roll away bed were both uncomfortable to sleep on. We also didn't have a stocked mini fridge in the hotel room...and when you're getting ready to go out in Vegas, you have to have some drinks! With that said, I do like the decor of the rooms and the restaurants a lot. I probably will give the hotel ONE more chance to see if they work out the kinks in the service (I go to Vegas 3-5x/year for work), but only because of the restaurant options.

My stay was mostly positive on the whole, here are my specific comments: Check-in: This was fairly smooth as I checked in on a Tuesday morning so there was no line. However, my room was not yet ready but they said they would call me when it was (this was at about 11 am, so I understood). However, I didn't get a call back until nearly 5pm! This was very frustrating as I had work to do and nowhere to do it - I ended up on a couch outside some of the conference rooms trying to have a conference call but it was not the best experience. Rooms: They were HUGE, very nicely appointed with a sitting area, kitchenette, dressing area, desk space, enormous bathroom and bedroom. Great design, with real art on the walls (not industrial crap you usually see in hotels). There are a few different configurations of room, but the ones I saw all have the bathroom (tub and shower specifically) somewhat exposed to the bedroom area - something to think about if you are planning on sharing a room with someone you are not intimately familiar with! I enjoyed the oversized shower and large soaking tub though. Great L'occitane bath products too. Beds were super comfy, lots of pillows and a nice duvet. Strangely enough for a room of this size, there was only 1 phone by the bed, and no phone on the desk which I found odd. Another strange thing was that the closet had a TON of space to hang clothes, but no drawers to put everything else. Food: lots of great restaurant options on site. I had an amazing meal at STK, and very good ones at Comme Ca and the casual Italian place next door to Scarpetta (I forget the name). I had wanted to eat at Scarpetta but couldn't get reservations. I ate at the Wicked Spoon buffet every morning for breakfast and I thought the food was very good, especially for a buffet, and priced fairly (I believe it was $17?). I did try to order room service on 2 occasions and both times there was a 1hour+ wait so I gave up and went to the buffet. I also ate some late night pizza at the \"secret pizza place\". I'm not a big gambler so I didn't try out the casino, but I walked through here a few times on my way to various destinations and was pleasantly surprised at the ventilation - cigarette smoke bothers me and they seemed to do an excellent job of filtering it out. Pools: I spent time at the regular pool by the spa as well as the \"dayclub\" Marquee pool - the dayclub is definitely a \"scene\" if you are into that sort of thing, I am not but was there to entertain clients. Since that pool is more of a club the focus is on drinks and bottle service, not as much on food or non-alcoholic beverages - for example I ordered an iced tea only to be told about 30 minutes later (service was a bit blase) that they only had hot green tea (??) and were out of basically every other non-alcoholic drink on the menu except water. Gee, thanks. The regular pool was fine though, if a bit windy as it's fairly high up. Check-out: this was a bit of an ordeal as I was leaving at noon on a Friday, so the place was swarming with arrivals. The lines they had set up were not very orderly - my guess is that the management doesn't want traditional lines mucking up the way the lobby looks (which is very cool, by the way), but the result is lots of confusion and it's unclear what desks are for concierge vs. check in/check out. When I was there the hotel had only been open a few months, and many of the rooms are still being finished, so I think that contributed to some of the issues above. I think with time they will work out many of the kinks and I would certainly stay here again! Also... very few hotels give free wi-fi like this one does.

We've done an annual trip to Vegas for each of the past 6 years. Past hotels we've stayed at: The Hotel, Wynn, Caesars and Bellagio. For our stay we upgraded to a corner suite on the 60 something floor (which is really like the 40 something floor but whatever) The Good The balcony is really cool. Really enjoyed having a cocktail while observing the sounds and sites of Vegas. Really hope future hotels (if there are any) include balconies. Corner suite is nice. Lots of room, two huge bathrooms, large living area. Really nice. Probably best we've had in LV. Service was solid. Ordered room service for breakfast each day and it was on time and hot. Check in was pretty prompt and friendly. Pool area was understaffed which is mind boggling to me. If you're charging $15 a drink, you'd think you'd make sure you have enough staff so that no one has to wait. Design is also impressive - it has a NY boutique feel even though it's massive. The Bad The pools are weak. The Boulevard Pool is a rip off. To sit by the pool you basically have to pay $300 for a day bed (or more for a cabana). I suspect because of this, the Bamboo pool fills up quickly and continually until it starts to resemble Rehab at Hard Rock (google it if you don't know what I mean). Didn't try the Day Club pool as I have no interest in having dance music blast at me at 1:00 pm (or 1:00 am for that matter). Seriously though, the music coming out of the Day Club was loud on our 60th (or 40th) floor balcony. I can't imagine what it would be like up close. Restaurant selection was average. Jaleo was quite good (but packed), DOCG was meh and nothing else really excited me. Sportsbook is modern but really small. I was betting horses and a couple of big tracks weren't even on the television bank. Pretty amateur. Can't imagine what they'll do when (or if) the NFL season starts. Plus they were insisting on $50 minimum bets (even for horse racing) before they'd give you a drink. The Trashy I cannot overstate how many women (well really girls) were marching around the place in dresses that would make Dad cry. For a man of my age with my lovely girlfriend it really was a bit awkward (albeit someone amusing). We ran into a few people our age or older who clearly were uncomfortable with the whole scene.

Front desk check in was prompt and I did not have to wait longer than 10 minutes. The restaurants are good. I didn't try The Henry or Holsteins restaurant because the menu was not varied and not to my likes it just has hamburgers and fries. I ate at STK, Estario Milos, The Wicked Spoon Buffet, and China Poblano. The restaurants except The Henry and Holsteins are varied and good. When a problem was encountered with housekeeping or service it was fixed immediately. They are still in their learning stages and need some feedback and it would help if they did a survey from their guests. Everyone was polite and congenial. The room layout is useful, and light and airy. Some other people have commented on the decor being tacky but to me this is typical of new boutique hotels. The technology features of the room, IPod hookup, and TV are great. The bars are spectacular with the views of the Chandelier. It has three levels in the center of the hotel. The Casino was small but you had varied table games and the dealers were the friendliest I have seen while being in Vegas. I had a great time while being there. Room service was great and on time, but more expensive than other hotels on Vegas. The Bad, Bell Service for our bags with check in was slow, I think this is because they are still trying to figure how to schedule enough people to the amount of guests. Housekeepers are friendly, but the management needs to give a checklist to them. I had a couple of issues with housekeeping but all were fixed by calling them. One day I had a sign which I put please clean room at 2pm and the room was never cleaned. I called them at 5pm and they did send someone up. The other problem was not enough washcloths, my call was quickly responded. The other problem was with my identity membership mix up. I signed up online before check in and I was told that I could use my room card for the membership, but when I went to the bar I was told I needed an additional card to use. Once again a call fixed the problem. When opening the fridge, you will get charged for the minibar due to items moving. Once again the charge was immediately credited to my account. The salon is short staffed and when I wanted to make a appointment I could not be accommodated but Anthony at the salon made arrangements for another Salon next door to the hotel. Thanks Anthony !. The Ugly, Our room was in the East tower and facing the Marquee Pool it was very beautiful but noisy due to being in close proximity to the club. This didn't bother me or my guests as I am a sound sleeper and noise doesn't bother me. The other problem was I made reservations for a Cabana at the Bamboo Pool a day prior and when I got to the pool the next day the reservation was not listed plus I was quoted another price. This was fixed when I talked to the manager. One restaurant I called to change the time of the reservation and when I arrived there they never acknowledged that this was done, but they made a attempt to accommodate large table of 6. To fix the problems they need more written material in the room for prices of Cabanas usage of ipod hookups and room features. They also need more staff for housekeeping and bell service This can be easily overlooked as the hotel is in its beginning stages. I am sure that on my next visit in November That this will be fixed.

If you stay in the East tower you'll get the noise, bass and crowd that frequents the club (Marquee, Google it!) located there. Even on the top floor you won't get quiet until 3 or 4 am. BUT, in the West Tower you'll have peace and quiet, rest assured-you may not even see a fellow guest in the hall. And West tower with a north view gets you the Bellagio fountains, south view is City Center which is like a morgue if that's your cup of tea, but still visually interesting. Cosmo is a high energy joint, but you can pick and choose. Like, the Boulevard pool is supercharged, but if you're like me you might like the Bamboo pool (relatively sedate) on the 14th floor West tower. Don't judge the whole place on first impressions of the lobby, which can be electric on weekend check-ins, complete with young crowds and a lot of eye candy, making for the club.

I booked this trip as a surprise trip for my mom\u2019s birthday. I chose the cosmopolitan because of the location and the pictures. We have stayed at the tower suites at The Mirage, Palazzo, Caesars Palace, and the Vdara, so I had many hotels in Vegas to compare this hotel to. I read trip advisor reviews before booking, I know newer hotels tend to have worse reviews than others, so I didn't have high expectations, but since it was one of the most expensive hotels offered and it was beautiful I figured it would be nice. It was very nice, the location was perfect, the balconies were amazing, the hotel was beautiful, but the service and management were terrible. Check-in: \u2018DJ\u2019 checked us in, we booked a 1 bedroom Terrance suite, but during check in he said he would 'upgrade' us to a premium view 1 bedroom facing the entire strip, where we would see Paris, the Bellagio Fountains, etc. We were very excited, but that excitement came to an end when we arrived to our room and saw we had a view of the Bellagio Garage... I called to speak with DJ, which I was told he was unavailable, and that I must have 'misunderstood' the view I was supposed to have, I told him I don\u2019t believe I \u2018misunderstood\u2019 anything, he continued to talk down to me, he was very rude. He then put me on forever hold when I asked to speak to the manager. I called back, again, finally was able to speak with DJ, who said he didn\u2019t know the hotel set up, and then moved us to a Terrance Suite facing the view he promised. After waiting another 1 hour for our keys to arrive, we had to move our luggage once again (on our own ) to the West Tower room. The room given to us was very large and beautiful, it had 2 full baths, full kitchen, huge balcony, separate bedroom and a great view. More about the room: The housekeeping was not up to par, we were not given any additional soap then what was offered during our arrival, she did not stock our towels, we had to call daily for more. I called for breakfast for room service, I ordered @ $50 worth of food to surprise my mom for her birthday. When I asked for the total, I was told it was $102. I asked her to please go through this bill for me. She told me that it is a automatic 18% gratuity, $5.00 service charge, and then a charge to use their utensils (so I guess that is about an additional $30.00). I told her to cancel my order; I was not paying an extra $50 for breakfast to be delivered to me! Also, the West Tower was quiet, until Friday when the club opened; we heard the \u2018boom boom\u2019 from the music being so loud all night! I can only imagine how loud the East Tower is. The beds are so comfortable, down feather blankets/pillows. The robes are also very soft. We also enjoyed having free internet since we brought our laptops. The room does not offer any plates, silverware, or coffee, you have to buy the coffee from the room for $7, and it is very strong. Initially we requested a late check out since our flight did not leave until 6:00pm, DJ informed us that he put in the request and that would be fine. We called the next day to make sure we had it, and they said there was no note of a late checkout, and he would put in the request. After that, we called the day of our departure to make sure we had the lake check out, and they said it was never entered, but that would be fine. Around 12pm that day of the departure, we had a service manager come to our room asking why we have not checked out, I had to once again tell them they said we could have the late checkout of 2pm, after the 4th time of going through this, they finally got it right. The Good: Besides all of the management mishaps, which I think it is partially due since the property is allegedly owned by Deutche bank due to foreclosure, only being managed by the Marriott, the hotel is in the PERFECT location. It is next door to the Bellagio, and across from Planet Hollywood which has the Magnificent Shopping Mile, the stores are unbelievable there! There are many restaurants offered at the Cosmopolitan, but from what I hear you must book STK 2 weeks prior or else it is booked. The hotel is also very beautiful, the crystal chandelier bar is incredible, I\u2019ve never seen anything so beautiful! The pool: since we were in the West Tower, we went to the Bamboo Pool, it was great. We were out there by 9am, so we easily were able to get a chair, it was pretty full by 10am, where people where fighting for chairs. The pool was very quiet, the water temp was perfect, the chairs were clean and comfy, and the drinks (try the sangria) were yummy! Shows: We saw the Lion King Musical at Mandalay Bay, wow what an incredible show!! If you are there before it ends in December, buy tickets! Out of any of the Broadway shows I have seen, this was one of the best. We also went to Peep Show starring Holly Madison, I am a big fan of her show on E! but all I can say is that was the biggest waste of $85 dollars per person (on sale from $120) we have ever paid, I want my money and my 2 hours back! The dancers had no talent, the show was boring, we ended up walking out early, the entire thing was a joke! Overall, the hotel management was terrible, but I would visit this hotel again, it was very nice to have a balcony, and if you have a premium view it is worth every penny, the location was perfect, and the hotel was beautiful, but I won\u2019t go until next year, so hopefully they get their act together. However, if you are looking for a more peaceful hotel with great service go to Vdara.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Medina, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Stay at the Cosmo\u201d", "Author": "gbutlerfan2", "ReviewID": "UR110841318", "Content": "This was our first trip to Las Vegas and after reading some of the negative reviews about the Cosmopolitan, I was a little concerned about staying here. Those concerns were put to rest the moment we walked in! My husband and I had the best experience from check in to check out. We checked in about 5:30 pm on a Friday night, there was not a single person in line. The front desk clerk who checked us in, up graded us to a one bedroom from a studio when he found out we were celebrating a birthday. He asked if we wanted a room with the Bellagio view, that might be a little loud due to the club bellow or a quiet room. We opted for a good night sleep and went with the quiet room. Unfortunately, my only complaint would be it wasn't as quiet as I would have liked. Lots of beat from the club bellow. But Hey, it's Vegas! The front desk clerk also noted that I requested feather free pillows, due to allergies. Once we made it to the room, 10 minutes later housekeeping was there with several feather free pillows!!! This was great. The room was fabulous! Decorated hollywood glam, very fun. We were there for 5 nights and I loved having all the closet space. I thought the giant walk in shower was great as was the soaking tub. The fact you could control everything with the remote on the tv had my husband playing with with all the controls; lights, air, you name it. We did not run into any glitches like some earlier reviews. One tip I read in an earlier review, buy Senseo coffee pods for the coffee maker, you can get them at Target. It will save you from purchasing coffee from the mini bar. (If Marriott wants their name attached to this hotel, the least they could do is have free in room coffee, but until then, by Senseo.) The pools are lovely, but we were there to sight see and gamble so we did not use the pools. The Night Life does cater to a younger crowd, if you own six inch heels girls, wear them here, you will fit in just fine! We had a great time just people watching. The Casino was pretty loud near the club and the tables do have higher limits, we actually did most of our gambling at the Bellagio next door, much more our speed. The mornings were great at the Cosmo, because everyone is up so late partying, you basically have the place to yourself in the morning. The morning we were leaving we ordered room service for breakfast, it was wonderful and one of the best meals we had, loved the whole set up. Wishing we had done this every morning! We also loved the valet parking. Every time we arrived at the hotel, we were always pleasantly greeted. When we would leave, they would give us bottles of water and always asked if we needed directions on where we were going.

The service (what service?) is AWFUL. Unfriendly, unhelpful staff who appear completely lost and uninterested in how to do their jobs. I often asked staff members questions about the pool, the restauraunts, the clubs and I often recieved blank stares and \"I don't know\" answers which would be fine - but it ended there! No attempt to find another staff member who could help or offer to follow-up with me. From the beginning, the front desk clerk did not offer any details about the hotel, ask if I had any questions (I did actually) or make me feel welcome in any way. My biggest complaint would be the pool. The Cabana \"Manager\" was one of the rudest, most dismissive people I have ever met (I was interested in renting a Cabana), but he could not be bothered and had no information for me (he actually told me this and then proceeded to scold a cocktail waitress in front of us for providing us 'incorrect' information on pricing).

It definitely was a good choice! We went May 19-22 and arrived around 10:00 AM Thursday. The place was impressive from the moment the cab drove up to it. The area going into the parking lot is really cool with large letters spelling out COSMOPOLITAN. Our room was not ready, but we were able to check in and they issued us keys that they would program when the room was ready and then give us a call. The person we dealt with was very nice and check-in went very smoothly. We asked to have a view of the Bellagio fountains and there was a room available, so we paid the minimal charge to upgrade. By 12:30, we received the call that our room was ready and we headed back to the hotel. It was much earlier than we had anticipated, so a nice surprise. We had an issue with our keys not working when we first tried them, but my husband thinks it is because he put them next to his phone and camera. We went to the front desk and they issued new ones immediately. When we got back to our room, they had our bags sent up and there was a security guard there to check on us. Apparantly when we tried the first keys, it triggered an alarm that someone was trying to get into the room. It was nice to know that they monitor that and respond quickly. When we saw the room, we were defintely sold on the place. It was a terrace, studio room on the 18th floor. Bathroom was awesome. Loved both the shower & soaking tub. The rest of the room was great as well. The bed was super comfortable, and of course, the view was outstanding. The mini bar was very well stocked, but pricey as you might imagine. Can of Coke was $5, but I needed it. Make sure you go over your mini bar purchases when you check out. The lady that we saw when we left asked us specifically about each item on the list and a couple of them we hadn't used, so she erased those charges. The rest of the place is really trendy and nice. The Chandelier is gorgeous and serves good drinks. The restaurants and nightlife are hopping in the evenings and there is good people watching in the Cosmo. The Marquee nightclub appears to be the new \"place to be\". The line to get in on Friday night was outrageously long. We had been to a show at The Venetian and Tao, which in the past had been really busy, had virtually no line. The only complaint I have read on here that I could see people having a problem with would be attempting to sleep in any close proximity to the nightclub. We were on the floor above it, but fairly far away and could still hear thumping throughout the night. I noticed that all the staff was trained to say hello when they passed us and most went on to ask how we were, too. As far as the technology, my husband actually enjoyed playing with it and we never had any issues with things not working.

We know this is early but have always been able to get access to a room where ever else we have stayed in Las Vegas, upon early check in. We where greeted by a host who chatted with us and explained we would be checked in when a staff member was free. Then when we where ushered to a check in staff member the mood changed drastically. She was very arrogant, unpolite and had a general attitude that did not make us feel welcome at all. She explained we where too early to acces a room because they where full the night before, this was understandable, however she was not forthcoming with help or information to how when we could access a room. She basically said it could be between 3pm & 7pm or even later. Ok we said, so can can you call us when our room is ready, no was the reply as we can not call UK mobiles?!

We could have been anyone checking in, hotel inspectors, a director of the hotel, or even someone on their holiday. The attitude of the check in girl was not acceptable and I certainly would not stand for it in my business. Beside the check in set back.

My husband, who traveled with me for fun, finally set the trash cans in the middle of the floor on the fourth day and they took the hint.

There seemed to be a lot going on Monday night, as I believe it's industry night at the club there (Marquee). I checked in around midnight, which doesn't seem late for Vegas. I actually booked the hotel that same day and prepaid the room online. But the front desk pulled up my reservation, gave me a look, and ran to the back without telling me why. When she came back, she said that they had no more of my room types and that I was getting a better room. However, she implied that I was lucky they even had a room for me because I checked in so late (even though I already paid). I ended up getting a beautiful Terrace Suite, so all was forgiven from the front desk. Room had a foyer that led to a big living room and an actual separate kitchen area with built-in fridge and dining table, plus a full bath. Tons of space. Bedroom was very nice and big and connected to an enormous bathroom (so 2 full baths in the suite). The best part about the room (imo) was the huge balcony. I've never seen a balcony at a Vegas hotel before, so this was a refreshing change. View was of the Bellagio fountains and entire north end of the strip - incredible. Definitely try to get a room on this side of the hotel. The lobby was very fancy and modern. I really liked that the casino was separated from the registration area and elevators. Most hotels in Vegas you need to walk through the casino to get to the elevators after checking in - not here. Arriving at midnight, it was nice not having to do that. The casino itself is very nice, albeit on the small side for a Vegas hotel. Doesn't feel like the casino is the focus of the hotel, which may explain why the rooms are a bit more expensive than typical on the strip. Also may explain why the hotel doesn't smell at all like cigarette smoke - at least much less than any other Vegas hotel I've been in. Hotel opened in Dec 2010, but I didn't notice much that was off as would be expected in a new hotel. The signage could use some work, as it was very confusing to figure out how to get to the walkways leading to neighboring hotels. And because of that, I walked around the conference facilities, which look to be very nice and not as conservative as other hotel conference areas (see: Mandalay and Caesars). Actual location on the strip can't be beat - Bellagio next door one direction, City Center the other. I only tried one restaurant - STK - which I know from NYC and Miami. And this one met the standards of the other 2. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone looking to be central on the strip in a very modern, chic place.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow", "Title": "\u201cService and design problems\u201d", "Author": "Copticstu", "ReviewID": "UR108461683", "Content": "Recently stayed 3 nights at the Cosmo. Arrived to find that our reserved rooms were no longer available - were put in a basic room and moved the next day. New room had no mini-bar contents (took 24 hours and 4 phone calls to get it filled). Stayed in wrap-around terrace suite. Great views (from NE corner and higher than 30th floor) but design of room could be a lot better. The desk is unusuable as the mirror behind the light throws a strong reflection in your eyes - and without the desk light on it is too dark. TV remotes temperamental. Door bells not connected and because of the design of the room if you are in the living area or bedroom you cannot hear people knocking on the door. My coffee machine did not work (kept fusing the electricity). Bath plug would not go down so could not take a bath. Lighting system is weird - you cannot turn off all the lights from the bedroom - you have to do it from the living room then find your bed in the dark. Some of the lights could not be turned on/off from their switch, only from the master. Very slow service in the casino. Little knowledge of the Identity program benefits from staff. The ipad system not working at checkout. IT problems with the Identity system misreacording slots play. Very noisy in the casino. Basically this hotel seems to be catering to the club crowd, and seems to be doing it very well. The restaurants were very busy too (but noisy). Nice buffet. Internet connection the slowest I have ever experienced - and temperamental. I will not return for quite a while as the service is just not up to standard - and can only improve. Some of the room design problems cannot easily be solved. And it will always be a noisy place on the casino / restaurant / shops levels as that is how they have designed it. If you like noise and can put up with poor service and design just to get the breathtaking views from the terrace rooms on the East tower then fine.

One day the shampoo wasn't replaced, the next day we had no extra tissue paper and the next day they forgot to give us washcloths. Our glasses were never replaced. We washed them ourselves. The restaurants are quite pricey. Over $30 for 2 miniature tacos, guacamole and one iced tea at the Chinese/Mexican restaurant. Waited in line for over 1/2 hour to get coffee in the morning at the coffee shop. Highly recommend the gelato there though, it was delicious. The bamboo pool is wonderful. One of the few pools in Vegas that doesn't blast the music and is relaxing. The pool on the east side is definitely for the young crowd and much louder but worth going to just to people watch. If you want to relax, definitely use the bamboo pool on the east side. The one big problem I had was the noise coming from the Marquee Night Club. Day and night you could feel the vibration from the music/base, not only in the room but also at the pool. Hotel lobby is beautiful and the chandelier bar is definitely worth seeing. Overall enjoyed my stay but jury is still out on whether I'd stay there again only because I'm older and the constant banging of the base from the nightclub got to me after a while.

I also requested a West Tower room, which she said she would make note of, but couldn't guarantee. No problem. Checked in around 5pm. No welcoming greeting from the check-in employee.

It was clear that he wasn't going to budge. So I asked to at least be moved to a higher floor because I was concerned about club noise. His response was, \"oh, the club noise isn't THAT bad\". My high hopes for Cosmo went out the window at this point. An hour after getting into our room and relaxing, a knock from a staff member saying he needed to check our minibar stock. Shouldn't they have done this before releasing our room for check-in? TV remotes and guide systems both didn't work properly.

Unlike some others I had no problems with toiletries and I did think that some days I had too many. The TV based control panel was interesting. Great in concept but I found it a bit hard to work in practice. The remote had to be pointed at just the right place, and even then there was sometimes a delay after the button was pushed for anything to happen. This lead to overshooting the desired choice. So I would have preferred something less technological to do much the same thing. My serious gripe was an inability to reliably connect to the net on the (free) wireless network. I had both an Iphone and a netbook. I travel extensively with these two devices and it is rather unusual to have any problems. The tech guy that came waved a device aroound and said \"there is a signal in this room, and that's all I can do for you\". At that time at least the Iphone was working but that connection subsequently became very patchy and unreliable. And not once could I connect the netbook. In the end it was the lack of help with the issue, rather than the difficulty itself, that has me sure that I would never return to this hotel or recommend it to anyone else.

We called that morning to confirm that we had a 1 bedroom terrace premium room. We asked to be placed in the quiet West tower with the views of the Bellagio fountain. From the time we arrived in the lobby to the time we opened out room door was about 10-12 minutes. The room was beautiful. The shower and tub combo was terrific. There were 2 40\" Samsung flat screen Tv's and you could control virtually everything with the remote control (temp, lighting, alarm, etc...) We left the DND sign on the door for the 1st 2 days and we received a card under the door stating that they noticed our sign up and to simply let them know when we wanted our room clean. We switched the sign to have them clean the room on Wednesday morning. We left to hit the town around 10am and by 3pm the room was spotless again. They view was incredible; The fountains go off every 30 min during the evening hours so we were treated to many variations of their \"show\" while we were in the room (which wasn't too often) Although they haev 3 different pools we only went to the Bamboo pool on the 14th floor of the West tower. It was awesome, although you get pretty baked from thr sun's reflection off of the surrounding hotels. We ate breakfast once at the Wicked Spoon, which was delicious and resonable at $14.00 a person. We also ate at the China Poblano which is a 1/2 chinese 1/2 mexican restaurant. It was pretty good. We also had a nice sit down meal at the Comme Ca, a french restaurant. It was delicious and they hotel staff gave us a table with a view of the strip. The Casino was gorgeous. It wasn't too big but it had vitrually every card and slot game that was in every other casino. I could not even tell it was smoking becuase of the high ceilings and great ventilation system.

We visited many of the other casinos and although they are all beautiful none could quite match the sleek, sheek vibe of the Cosmo. Although I have not had the chance to visit any rooms in the other hotels first hand, there is no question that I will be staying here again the next time I visit Las Vegas! 2 extremely minor gripes: 1. the TV alarm did not work 2. You can check out in your room however this feature was not responding when we wanted to check out. No biggie; you can check out in the lobby without waiting in line; took us about 4 minutes to check out Friday morning. I'm really not sure why this place received so many negative reviews. Obviously Vegas is way more busy during the weekend than the week so that might affect service. However, I think that people will just find something, anything to complain about. I'm happy to say that I had one of the best times of my life and would stay again in a heartbeat!!", "Date": "May 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norfolk", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Choice\u201d", "Author": "Kasperblue", "ReviewID": "UR107659729", "Content": "This was our first trip to Las Vegas, so I was a little anxious about staying at the Cosmopolitan, mainly because we booked last year before it had opened. We were not disappointed at all!! Entering the lobby was fantastic, and the huge screens on the columns near reception are a great touch. The check-in lines were short and we managed to get served within 10 minutes. We had booked 7 nights in a Terrace Suite, and our friends (on completely separate booking) a City Room. We couldn\u2019t check in straight away because the rooms were not ready, I had half expected this after ready the reviews on TA, so was un-phased, so we went for a drink in the chandelier bar for an hour whilst we waited for our rooms to be ready. The chandelier bar was awesome and such a great centrepiece for the Cosmopolitan. We went back to check-in around 4.30pm. We managed to get our rooms and we were upgraded to a One Bedroom Suite with Premium View, the guy at check-in kindly linked our booking with our friends, and offered an upgrade to the same room type as ours so we could be near each other \u2013 lovely touch and a great upgrade for them. Our rooms were 6696 and 2096, both overlooking the Bellagio fountains. The one bedroom suites have great facilities, the bath with the view of the fountains is a great touch and a perfects place to wind down after a hectic day exploring the strip. We didn\u2019t really use the kitchenette, but it is definitely lacking in equipment, a couple of plates or bowls would be a good addition so you could bring back food if you wanted. The bed was comfy and the TV and lighting worked well for us at all time. The \u201cGoodbye\u201d switch was useful (switches off everything when you leave the room). The views from the balcony are out of this world, I wouldn\u2019t imagine any other hotel could top this view. I do agree with others about the clientele at this hotel \u2013 it is definitely for the younger crowd, especially at the weekends. We were a group of 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s and the atmosphere was perfect for us. It\u2019s not really a family or older couple type of place, it\u2019s just very trendy. Even though there is no theme in this hotel it does easily stand out from others on the strip, it\u2019s a bit like walking into a new and classy nightclub/bar. All the hotels were great on the strip, but this is definitely one of my favourites. Location is what makes this place, it is so central and both ends of the strip were accessible walking or by taxi. Some friends stayed in the Bellagio, and it was only a 10 minute walk room to room, which was ideal for us. We ate in the Wicked Spoon Buffet on two occasions for breakfast, and both times I was very impressed with the food. A great range from cereals to omelettes to steak. We had breakfast at 9am both times and the queue was less than 10 minutes. We didn\u2019t eat in any of the other restaurants, which we will definitely do next time we go. We did keep an eye out for the Secret Pizza Place because of the good reviews on TA, but never saw it the whole time\u2026..(it\u2019s very secret!)! The hairdryer in the room broke on the first day and we called \u201cBeck and Call\u201d who promptly sent someone up with a new hairdryer within 30 minutes. We also requested feather free duvets and pillows as I am allergic, and this was deal with in no time at all. I know there have been major issues on TA with the hotel service and staff \u2013 I can honestly say we had no problems at all\u2026\u2026without offending anyone (everyone is entitled to their own opinions) but how anyone can rate this hotel at less than 3* is beyond me! In summary, it was a brilliant hotel with all the features I would want and would expect from a 5* hotel.", "Date": "May 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cFabulous hotel on the strip!\u201d", "Author": "andreGeneva", "ReviewID": "UR107657814", "Content": "The newly opened Cosmopolitan is really the place to go in Vegas!

Upon returning home I gave it glowing reviews to anyone who would listen. After telling a friend to stay here on their next trip they emailed my the Trip Advisor review link and I have to say that I was very surprised. I am on ex Front office hotel manager so have certain service standards that annoy me as they do everyone else. Here is an overview of my stay and the pros and cons: Check-in - Agreed, this took longer than I thought it should have taken. I think there is a certain amount of ramp up time involved with new openings and hopefully this process begins to speed up with practice (seemed like they were adding in a lot of info that they should already have such as address). The Lobby is great with huge LCD screens on the pillars that constantly update while you wait. Never had a problem with the elevators, they were always very quick and I was there over 2 sold out nights. Room - WOW...apparently there are 800 standard hotel rooms and the rest of the over 2,000 are like studio apartments with balconies. I did not have a view of the Bellagio fountain but on the other side looking at the City Center. Still a great view and definitely a hug benefit for the hotel compared to others I have stayed in. I have read the reviews about the noise from the Marquis Club and although I was there from Thurs-Sat, my room was not affected. There must be a certain side to one of the towers that is not good. I would recommend at check in to ask. Amazing shower and tubs, 2 interactive TV's that you can adjust lights, temperature, book restaurant resv, spa, you name it and it is on the TV. I'm from the younger generation so this was a very cool feature and definitely the way of the future. Also, did not hae a room service issue to mention. I recognize some peoples comments on the kitchenette not being stocked but did not use it while there. If this amenity is something that appeals to you (traveling with kids), I would recommend contacting the hotel prior and having them clarify what is available in the room and what additional items they can bring up for you. I cannot stress enough though that these studio rooms are so much more than a standard hotel room based on size and amenities!!!! Amenities - Something like 12 restaurants, I ate at Jaleo's (spanish tapas) where the food and service were great. Also ate at Holsteins, the burger and shake place and was very happy. The restaurants are all close together on the second floor, very convenient. They have several lounges and bars that were great to have a drink in as well and all near the casino on the first floor. Casino space is good but didn't get much time to write a full review. This is definitely a hip/chic hotel with amazing amenities and the rooms are spectacular for what you normally get. Hopefully some of the service issues that I have seen on here get addressed with management, however I did not experience any of them. I would highly recommend the Cosmopolitan to anyone I know that is heading to Vegas.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingston, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cNot too great\u201d", "Author": "Preciousbaby48", "ReviewID": "UR107438071", "Content": "After reading all of reviews of the Cosmopolitan, I feel compelled to add my review. My sister, my daughter and her boyfriend and myself booked our trip in January for a stay in March. We booked two Terrace 1 bedroom suites with premium view. My sister and I were on the sixteenth floor and overlooked the pool area which was about three floors below. While the room was beautiful, we had to listen to non stop music from the pool area below. It became rather annoying after a very short time, particularly when we were sitting on the balcony trying to enjoy a glass of wine. We did NOT have a premium view. My daughter and her boyfriend were on the 60th floor, which again had no view. They faced the city and the airport. My question is, why did we pay for premium views when clearly neither room had that view. Also, I would like to comment that maid service was pretty much non existent. Our garbage sat for days without being cleaned up and we were charged to snacks in the room that we had not consumed...which I will admit were refunded upon our pointing this out.

From the moment I arrived I was in awe of the modern details and sleek design of the place. Everything is bright and sparkly and exactly how Vegas should be. I had nothing but excellent service all week. Super quick check in; Arrived around 2pm and was meeting another couple who had already checked in. Requested a room nearby and was quickly accomodated. Walked into the large, airy Terrace Studio Suite (East Tower) which has sweeping views of City Center and the South Strip. Absolutely gorgeous at night. Housekeeping and Room service were great. Upon arrival I found an exploded bottle of champagne in the empty freezer that had leaked all over. One phone call and five minutes later someone showed up to clean it out and fill the ice bucket so we didn't make the same mistake. Went out the second day around 9am and returned at 4pm to find that housekeeping had not been in yet, despite the sign hung on the doorknob to please clean. Called housekeeping to request a room clean and by the time I was back from the pool it was complete, and there were fresh linens and towels. The beds were turned down nightly and toiletries replenished daily. The next day the front desk called at 5pm to confirm the room had been cleaned that morning just to make sure there was no repeat, and there was never another problem with it. Bed was soooooo comfy it was hard to get out of. TV controls all aspects of your stay but there are thermostats and swithes for the techno-impaired. Used the order form on the back of the door to order breakfast one day; filled it out at night with anticipated time of delivery (chose 9-9:30am) and at 9:01am there was a knock at the door and the server slid a cloth covered table into the room, complete with linen rolled silverware and indiviudal use condiments. Had a delicious Belgian waffle with whipped cinnamon butter, warm syrup, and a bowl of fresh blueberries, raspberries and strawberries... What a way to start the day!!!! I purchased a pack of Senseo coffee pods prior to visiting that work with the Intazza coffee maker and had my own fresh brewed coffee on the balcony every morning. Ceramic cups and a stack of takeaway cups provided. The casino isn't huge but has every kind of slot machine and table game you could possibly want to play, as well as complimentary drinks while playing. The dealers were knowledgable and friendly, and remembered our names when we came back to play more. I didn't sign up for a players card because I wasn't expecting to spend a lot of time in the casino but it is available. Staff was constantly cleaning and wiping down the machines which was good for a clean freak like me! Visited the Wicked Spoon Buffet, which had a $29 dinner, including all alcoholic beverages. Food was warm and constantly refilled. Loved that certain dishes were in invididual bowls and pots which kept unsanitary spoons off my plate. There was a wonderful dessert display with several dozen different sweets all miniature and in tiny glasses and plates. I am not a buffet person and was pleasantly suprised. I didn't have any other meals in the Cosmo other than snacks at the pool, which were brought out fresh and hot. The pools were small but refreshing with plenty of loungers. The day beds and cabanas are available for \"rent\" with prices from $150-200 to $3500 depending on size. That included a drink and food credit but I was happy with a large sofa-style lounger for free to enjoy a cocktail and dip into the pool. Gets loud at times and by mid afternoon the sun is hidden behind the large buildings in city center so get out early to late morning to start working on your tan! Late nights in Vegas don't leave many early risers. Other than a few entitled individuals who always had something to say and expected something for free there didn't seem to be any problems or disruptions all week. I was comped a free breakfast and a few free drinks including a bottle of wine which was a nice touch. The club outside is definitely loud and I could feel the bass pulsing while I was in the shower even!! It does play music late and it can be heard even with the glass closed... but why are you going to bed early anyway??! Live it up. Overall the staff was so pleasant and helpful. Mixed drinks were accordingly priced for a Vegas resort, but walk across the street to order 2 for $5 beers. Don't come to the Cosmo expecting a bargain, come anticipating a luxurious break and when you're ready for the hustle and bustle of the Strip, step outside.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel look for discounted prices\u201d", "Author": "Nanatimes5", "ReviewID": "UR107426342", "Content": "Has every amenity possible, views ok but balconey is fantastic.

Fantastic hotel, VERY partying place in a perfect location on the Strip. We booked a City room with premium view through British Airways. Then read the reviews and got quite worried. However, we didn't feel out of place as there were quite a mix of guests though I have never seen so many pneumatic chests and trout pouts before! We arrived on the weekend and there seemed to be lots of gatherings and parties going on. We arrived at about 9.00 pm LV time (8 hours behind GMT and a 12 hour flight), so we were TIRED. We waited in the queue for about 20 minutes - so not bad going really and it helped by the member of staff welcoming us and apologising for the wait. The hotel's public areas are very busy and noisy with loud music playing but the corridors to rooms were empty. Our room was quiet and we were not disturbed, although our first night was a Friday when I believe the outside disco happens and we still slept fine despite the jet lag. It was a most sumptuous bed and pillows - could have stayed there! The room was gorgeous - top quality - books around, two flat screens, wet-room type shower, double sit-in tub overlooking strip. Could not fault it, BUT, we were looking for things I suppose because of reading earlier reviews. When we arrived there was a piece of paper on the floor and a coffee spill on the balcony, the rooms were not cleaned until late in the day, although before we realised this was perhaps the norm and we telephoned for service they came straight away. When we asked for more toiletries the very polite and friendly housekeeper came back with more, no problem. They seemed VERY busy and obviously need more staff. Again, as previous reviews, this is no excuse for a 5* hotel - attached is a photo of the shower shelf when we arrived. We were in the East Tower on 30th floor with a mind-blowing view of the Bellagio fountains that will stay with me forever. We had the same upset as others had with the pool on one day. This seemed a very busy time In LV and the Cosmopolitan and a lot of the beds around all pools were taken. Then we just got a nice pitch after dashing about all day and we were told the pool was closing at 4.00 so could we go! We were directed to the Marquee Day Club and had to have a wristband. That was full of young wannabes and the music was loud (good music, just that we heard it all before so wanted a bit of peace and relaxation). We did get a 'double' lounger and enjoyed the last of the sun. The Spa is also top quality. Our flight home was in the evening and so when booking with BA we requested a late checkout. Unfortunately the Cosmopolitan couldn't tell us whether this would be possible until the last day - then on the last day we were told they were full! My husband complained and again, good service, we were given a complementary day pass to the Spa. Trouble was, my husband was waiting over an hour for me to come out! I especially loved the 'Cool Room' - a cooling mist and spray smelling of eucalyptus coming down from the ceiling. The staff here were also great - let us keep our suitcases in their office so we could change etc for the flight home. We had a meal in Milos and that was real quality. All the other restaurants looked good but very busy, and as we'd had complementary breakfast through British Airways we sampled the Wicked Spoon every morning. The breakfast buffet was superb. I think it was $20 odd if you paid and it would have been worth it. No queuing even at the weekend (think everyone else was still partying or in the casino!) but on the weekdays it seemed busier due to business/conference guests. Very efficient and friendly breakfast service whenever. The Wicked Spoon didn't seem to know about our complementary breakfast but a visit to concierge just removed the charge and made a note on the system. Thereafter we were 'charged' as normal but it just didn't appear on our 'folio' on the room tv (we are technophobes but we did manage to check out etc on the screen though we couldn't get the music right). We had no problems with random items from the fridge being charged. We took coffee and creamer with us as advised on a previous review (good old TA) and used hot water from the machine. Having said that, even my husband was able to work out the coffee machine and I don't think the replacement pods were expensive. We had a great time on our first visit to Las Vegas and visited all the big hotels and they were just as spectacular as expected. The older ones are obviously tired and smell a bit damp and well-used - New York New York and Excalibur particularly. The Venetian and Palazzo were just amazing - gorgeous. We saw the Jersey Boys at the Palazzo which was brilliant. We saw Gladys Knight (and one Pip) at the Tropicana. Her show was great and she was superb, as was her supporting musicians and singers, but we wanted her old style and they had 'jazzed up' the classics like Midnight Train etc. We still enjoyed her though. We had intended booking shows at the ticket offices on the street but were caught out by not having photo id with us (we only had passports which we kept in the safe). I don't think we had a bad deal though booking directly with the venue. The Deuce was easy. Just got two day tickets and went downtown for the Freemont Experience. And it was an experience! Some real sights there, literally. It feels a bit dodgy but were ok. Really friendly hat seller (I bought a little trilby which seems de rigeur at the moment) recommended the restaurant at the hotel round the back - I think it was The Station Platform or similar name. Another old original past its sell by day but again, it was an experience and we paid for a buffet meal which was really cheap like $15-17 and we had lovely food. Went to Grand Canyon with Sundance Tours. Had read loads on TA about who to use and Sundance were recommended by someone I work with. They were first class. Great organisation and service. We went on the 'All American' which was first thing in the morning (suited our jet lag). Sonny was our pilot who was great. However, I'm sorry to admit it but I was disappointed with GC. Perhaps it was my expectations after all the pics I've seen. Also you only land on a ledge, which apparently is where the indigenous people will let them land. So where does one land for a ride along the Colorado?? The trip as a whole though was memorable and worth the \u00a3500+. Can't comment on any gambling. We didn't....... Finally, I wished I had noted the name of the lady on passport control on our way in - she was lovely and actually welcomed us. It has been a few years since our previous visits to the States, put off by the frosty attitude etc etc. Thank you - restored our faith.", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montgomery, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cVery modern and sleek hotel\u201d", "Author": "W&Y", "ReviewID": "UR107175901", "Content": "Very modern, clean hotel.

I mentioned that to a very helpful person at the Bamboo pool and she rolled her eyes clearly fed up with them too. She explained that they are all newly hired summer help and she's already tired of them. And heres a note about the pool servers. They are all exactly the same height and age- 18 to 21, heavily tattooed and have yet to develop hips to justify the tiny bikinis. Also they love to talk with each other in the corners. But thats only the tip of the iceberg at this hotel. The pools are very small and crowded. \"Reserved\" chairs remain empty all day even though other guests can't find a place to sit. There's no shade. There's no pool party atmosphere as you would find at other hotels like the Wynn, Mandalay Bay or the Hard Rock. The pool was not designed to encourage socializing. I would in fact rate the pools at the Cosmo as the worst n Vegas. The Casino small so the number of gambling options are few. The sports book room is tiny and uninviting with no seating and no atmosphere. I went to Caesars to watch some games and found that the odds were better and the crowd much more fun. Remember that this was supposed to be a condo building so the rooms are not typical hotel suites. There is no privacy when you are in the bathroom so taking a shower is impossible. Also the room wasn't completely clean when I checked in. One thing that really kind of got to me was that the maid didn't replace my tissues with a new box. Rather she just stuffed a wad of tissues into the old empty box. Except she stuffed so many in the box broke! When I went to get a tissue I literally flung the box across the room. The Cosmopolitan is now owned by the Deutsche Bank who took it over after the developers defaulted on their loan. This old european bank has no interest in owning a casino and no experience in the hospitality industry and it shows. Management is so cheap that they won't pay for the Direct TV sports package. This created a near riot when a large group of Brits wanted to watch a big Manchester United soccer game by the pool. It's a casino hotel. I think they could pay for the upgraded sports channel package. I really feel sorry for the more experienced employees who have to keep their mouths shut about how the place is being run. I know that a lot of them are just waiting it out until new management steps in. I wish them the best. My advice is to avoid the Cosmopolitan and opt for another more established hotel.", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cInteresting experience...\u201d", "Author": "VajVaj", "ReviewID": "UR106763120", "Content": "Was upgraded to a superior room, large room at least compared with European standards.

Browsing the reviews made me a bit nervous. Glad to report I had nothing to be nervous about. There were a few minor issues (see below) but my overall experience was positive. It seems that a good number of people have complained about the hotel\u2019s staff (one of the reasons I was nervous). I can tell you that I have NEVER been at any hotel (and I have stayed at many hotels worldwide) where all staff I encountered was incredibly friendly, helpful and always anticipated my needs. From the front desk, valet staff, Wicket Spoon buffet, Va Bene, Chandelier Bar, cashier to housekeeping, everyone was nice and helpful. Kudos to the Cosmo team, an A+. My room was amazing. The view was incredible overlooking the Fountains of Bellagio. I had a Terrace Suite and it was super nice to have a balcony on the 33rd floor overlooking the Strip. The room is indeed high tech. All of the room\u2019s functions are controlled from the TV. You can control lights, temperature, even set different moods for your room. A great tool to create a romantic setting! You can pick music from a variety of Sirius satellite stations on your TV also, set wake-up calls to music, sounds and TV. You can even use the TV to book appointments and view your itinerary. I can see where this may be a bit confusing to people not used to technology. I loved it. The bathroom is divine. There is a HUGE shower, a nice spa tub, and the CO Bigelow products are great too. Room also has a microwave, dishwasher (no dishes) and fridge with some room for your personal stuff. The pod coffee maker brews better than average coffee. I particularly enjoyed drinking my morning coffee on my balcony overlooking the Strip. They provide to-go cups and ceramic mugs. Bed was comfortable with ample pillows and a pillow top mattress. Also like the selection of art books, color pencils and other small touched that made the room unique and top rate. I saw that many people complained about the noise. Yes, with the slider on the balcony open on the 33rd floor I could still hear the sounds from the Strip. The music from various clubs, the traffic and music from the Bellagio Show drifted up to the room. With the windows closed however it was super quiet and I slept like a baby. I enjoyed a visit to the Wicked Spoon Buffet for breakfast on Friday and the buffet is indeed amazing (yes, another amazing). Breakfast was $17 + tax and tip. The selection was incredible, and our server was super. I really wanted to go back for lunch and dinner but didn\u2019t have the time. Only \u201cnegative\u201d is that the buffet is out of the way, located in the convention area of the hotel. We had not anticipated the walk, which made us 15 minutes late for an appointment. Definitely going back in the future! I visited Va Bene, the coffee shop on the 2nd floor by the Chandelier Bar about 5 times during my stay. Not inexpensive but coffee was good and the panetone and gelato was to die for. Even though it seemed super busy, I never had to wait more than 5 minutes for my car to come out of East Tower Valet. Also liked I never had to walk through the casino to go to valet. And now for the not so good stuff. Housekeeping seems to be a bit of an issue. My room was ready upon arrival but a few things were really not up to par. There was a long black hair in one of the drawers in the bathroom, and a Vanity Fair magazine was left inside the trunk at the foot end of the bed. The second day, housekeeping did not replace the coffee service and neglected to empty a trash receptacle in the room. Not acceptable for a hotel of this caliber. Although the hotel opened less than 5 months ago, the room already showed some the signs of use. Some of the carpet by the bed was frayed. The closet doors had some marks on them, and one of the curtains had a stain. Again, not something I would expect from a hotel of this caliber. My overall experience at The Cosmopolitan was great and I will be back in August for a 5 night stay.

We were attracted by the decor of the hotel, its good location on the strip, and its positioning as more of a resort property. We booked their most expensive room (a wrap around suite) directly with the hotel at their standard rate, but were given a low floor room that looks onto roof vents of the adjacent building. I offered to pay more to be moved to a room with a view, but was told the request could not be accommodated. All hotels have these kind of room differences and they are usually managed by charging different rates for different views. Not this hotel. You may be stuck with a substandard room regardless of what rate you pay. There were many other problems with the hotel. One example, they have two regular pools (Boulevard and Bamboo) and one club pool (really part of the Marquee Nightclub). During all three days of our stay, they closed the Boulevard pool all day, and then closed the Bamboo pool at 4:00 pm. Since it was the only regular pool, it was very crowded and active, and they literally had security break up the party and send everyone home at 4:00, which is basically noon on Las Vegas time. This created a lot of unhappy residents. Like others, we had to work to get basic services. Most days, we had to call to get the room serviced. We called in room service orders more than one and half hours in advance and they were still consistently late. The mini-bar was never refreshed. A major problem with the hotel is a lack of service elevators because the property was constructed as a condominium project. The room service people frequently wait 30 or more minutes just to get an elevator. The property looks great, and I think succeeds at creating an edgy, cool environment, but it is very poorly managed.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLoved the special touches\u201d", "Author": "meowkapow", "ReviewID": "UR106672955", "Content": "Like many I was taken in by the photographs of the amazing balcony views and then worried by some of the stories relayed in some of the reviews on this website.

Good things about the Cosmo: - Location, casino directly onto strip (just 5-10 min walk from your room). - Terrace is a big bonus for this property - so nice to have fresh air and depending on the view somewhere to chill out after a long day/night on the strip. - Free Wi-fi in the rooms which only cut out once during our week long stay. - Fitness Centre - Husband used it 3 times and at $12 per day thought it was very reasonable. Some of the issues we encountered included: - Requested for the mini-bar to be cleared at $25 fee - took 2 days, 3 phone calls and 2 visits to the lobby to sort out. (The day after check-in, they even restocked it as the instructions had not been clear to the mini-bar team). - Safe locked upon arrival - took 3 days to resolve, numerous calls, waiting on security to show up. They even sent 2 maintenance guys 10 mins apart from each other and both said security had to resolve (why they couldn't figure this out, I don't know why) - Housekeeping. 1st day, no housekeeping at all, by chance there was a maid in the hall when we were going out at 6pm and we advised her that we would like our room cleaned, other than that I don't think it would have been done. There was only 1 day that the room was serviced correctly but on other days, the bathroom was not cleaned and the timing was hit and miss. I do tip each day and was disappointed with the level of care taken in cleaning the rooms. - Jacuzzi jets in our room kept turning on randomly during our stay, trying sleeping when it starts going off at 5am some mornings. - TV in room - Based on the reviews I was worried about the working the lights etc via the remote control. I'd love to comment on that but given that we had no interactive services on our TV at all and the only way to change the TV channel was to input each number it was just such a pain. (Another visit from the tech team, who were able to advise us that the interactive function did not work at all on floors 41-45 in the West Tower and we should have been told at check-in - again, frustrating lack of info from reception). - Pool area and food. We only used the Bamboo Pool as we had heard that the Boulevard Pool was more lively which did not realy suit our holiday. The Bamboo Pool was nice, relaxed but on 2 occasions when we did order food it was undercooked. When my husband raised this with the waitress she was none too pleased. Normally I wouldn't make a big deal of this but with being 6 months pregnant, raw food just isn't gonna work. After the second incident we did not chance the food again. Also on 2 occasions the pool actually shut at 4pm because of a private function - it would be interesting to see if they try that one out in July when people need to be at the pool because it is so hot. - Restaurants - very expensive, only ate at the Wicked Spoon buffet as our breakfast was comped but would not have eaten there otherwise especially given that our first days breakfast cost $104, (Easter brunch price and no other alternative) for 2 coffees and some toast. Check-out. Given that the first fee that was on the bill was the $25 for 'Mini-bar Clear', it was amazing to see page after page of mini-bar charges below. The woman at check-in looked blankly at us when we said that we had the mini-bar cleared and that the charges were impossible. She did clear them off the bill after a look of disgust at us for questioning her. Not a very nice way to end the experience. Overall, the terrace onto the rooms at the Cosmo is the only differentiating factor here but this would not be enough to sway me to stay again given the poor customer service.

We had never been to Vegas before but found the location of the hotel perfect for getting around and visiting some of the other hotels. In line with some other contributors the only negative aspect to our stay centered around the disappointing service provided at the front desk. We had requested a room suitable for a guest with disabilities and this could not be provided - despite the fact we had booked over 3 months prior. Neither did we get all our 3 rooms on the same floor which meant quite a lot of switching between floors to ensure we could provide assist to one member of our party. The apology was a food and beverage credit to our rooms which whilst nice to have we would have preferred the rooms we'd booked. It also took 5 calls/trips to reception over 2 days before someone actually came to our room to unlock the safe that had been left locked by the previous guests.

I was directed to a line by a very pleasant employee and was appreciative that she was helping me find a short line. No sooner did I get in line that everyone behind the counter but one person disappeared and I waited longer than I would have if I had stayed where I was. It was obvious this woman was not told to bring people to this area that was not going to be staffed. I inquired about a special check-in line for Marriott Rewards members. She made a face and said that they might have that in the future. Someone else in my line heard my Marriott question and commented as well that he was a rewards member and she changed the subject. It was obvious they want to downplay that connection so people don't make judgements about the hotel based on the other properties in the brand. I was told my room wasn't ready (it was one hour before check-in) but they did have a room with two queens. I decided to take it and wished I hadn't. I got to the room and started to unpack and wondered what all the excitement was about. Nothing spectacular regarding the size, amenities, view, etc. I was told I had a great view of the Bellagio watershow and I think they tell most people that. I had a view of about 1/5 of the show and a wall of another part of the hotel. Hardly a great view. Realized that I didn't have a balcony so I called down and spoke to Alex at the front desk. To say he is obnoxious is an understatement. I told him that I was not given the room that I booked and paid for and he told me they are all the same. When I told him that I don't have a balcony, fridge, and my room was about 150 sq ft smaller he then said they are the same price. I questioned that someone would pay the same price for a room that was smaller, with less amenities, and no balcony and he said that I could change rooms but would have to wait until 6PM. When I questioned that check-in was 3PM he advised that is when it starts and because they are \"the hottest hotel on the strip\" people have to wait for their rooms. Anyone who visits Vegas regularly as I do for business and pleasure knows that doesn't last long and soon there will be another \"hottest hotel on the strip\" and they will regret their attitude and their poor customer service. I decided to shrug this poor service off and go to my spa appointment. When no one came to collect me at the waiting room I went to the spa check-in desk and found that they had the wrong time for my appointment. They were not able to change it to the time I had confirmed the day prior and because I needed to be somewhere that evening had to cancel. Will never return to this hotel again not because of the problems that I experienced as it is a new hotel and these things happen but instead because of the attitude of the staff who think that people should accept poor customer service because they are staying at the \"hottest hotel on the strip\".", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, very impressed.\u201d", "Author": "rickyjc88", "ReviewID": "UR106379065", "Content": "Stayed at the Cosmopolitan for 3 nights March 31st \u2013 April 3rd with the gf in a terrace studio (premium view).

Here, my wife and I felt like we were on top of each other when we were getting ready. At the Venetian we felt like we each had our own bathroom because it was so big. All the food and especially coffee in the morning is down on the East tower. There is one coffee place in the whole resort which is in the 2nd floor of the East Tower. It is always very busy with a long line. They mess your order up and you have to wait longer for it. They need a Starbucks in each tower or at least get something in the west tower so we don\u2019t have to walk so far.

Not sure what was growing in the bottom. 2) Twice we were dangerously low on toilet paper and they didn\u2019t leave us an extra roll after cleaning the room. 3) Next day we were out of Kleenexes and we put the box at the front of the sink so it was real obvious and they didn\u2019t replace it. 4) They took my wife\u2019s shower cap and didn\u2019t leave her another one. 5) They took the cups out of the bath room and didn\u2019t replace them. They did this twice. 6) They restocked the amenities like conditioner and mouth wash that we didn\u2019t use and then took all the shampoo and bath wash that we did use! What\u2019s up with that? Don\u2019t even think about extra towels or a towel refresh at night. Left a $5 maid tip per day for a while and didn\u2019t notice anything better service. Stopped tipping after I got tired of the repeated bad service. I will say that when I called down each day for what they did not replace, they quickly brought up plenty of whatever was needed. It would just be nice to not have to call for basics in the first place. With this and all the other reviews it seems like there is a pattern of bad service to me. And there is certainly nothing extra going on in the service department. If they want the image of a \u201chigh end\u201d hotel, the need to up they service in the rooms. Absolutely the most complicated coffee maker I have ever seen in a hotel room. (And I travel for business ALL the time.) I tried for over 45 minutes to get a cup. I looked for any documentation on how to run it. I even called housekeeping and they had me \u201creset\u201d it. There was some secret to it but I couldn\u2019t figure it out. This thing is just not easy to use. Go down to Va Bene or order room service if it isn\u2019t too long to get something. And to think I paid $5 for the damn coffee setup \u2013 and NO coffee. The next day they left a brewing guide next to the coffee maker. Would have been nice to have that when I was trying to get my gosh darn coffee. They did easily refund my $5 for coffee setup when we checked out. The ash tray on the balcony was full when we got there and it wasn\u2019t emptied once while we were there. The bed is not comfortable. Sags in the middle. Had to double up on the pillows because they were so thin. They just seem to be understaffed at times. Housekeeping seems to be lazy, rushing, or over worked. Almost two hours (1:45) for just coffee room service on Sunday morning. That is too much. They don\u2019t have a dedicated taxi line. It takes forever to get a cab if there is a crowd like when the pool is letting out from a concert. Beware, it took us 30 minutes to get a cab that night. Most other nights it was 5-10 minutes at most. No mention or recognition of my Marriott Platinum status. Didn\u2019t expect much there as it is not a Marriott proper hotel. All in all, very disappointed with the hotel and room. Only saving grace is the beautiful balcony and good food. I can only think how I would have felt if we didn\u2019t have the Bellagio view and we were getting beat with the sun each afternoon. The poor service at this hotel would have just been too much\u2026 Only stay here if you get a deal and the good balcony view.

But, I was glad I didn't cancel. Arrived on a Monday Night at 11:30PM and was checked in about 15 minutes. I originally booked a Terrace Studio however, when I arrived there were none available so they Upgraded me FREE to a Terrace One Bedroom Suite on the 66th Floor of the Eastside Tower. You need to swipe your room key in the elevator before it will let you select a floor, which is a nice extra form of security. ROOMS: Absolutely the BEST on the Strip, HANDS DOWN. Everything is new, clean and well appointed. The bed was probably the best hotel bed I've ever slept in. Only issue I did have with the room was with the Balcony sliding door it tended to get stuck quite a bit. I called maitanence and they were up at the room within 15 minutes, they claimed it was because the place was so new and they haven't been used that much. But, once I got the balcony door open the VIEW!!!!! Again, the BEST in Vegas HANDS DOWN. One strong negative if your on the EASTSIDE Tower is the noise level from the clubs late at night. This would go on every night until at least 3AM. So if you're there for work and need shut eye don't stay on the EastSide! SERVICE: In general, everyone I dealt with personally was VERY friendly and helpful. The dealers in the casino are amongst the nicest. They don't wear name tags, so it's a way to get a conversation going. I will say something about the Housekeeping though: My Room WAS cleaned WONDERFULLY EVERY day BUT, I was out of my room at 7AM everyday back at 4PM and the Room still wasn't cleaned. They do a good job but I wish they would clean a little earlier in the day especially considering how early I was out of the room each day. Other than that, NO Service Issues at ALL.

Well 36 floors above the nightclub, you would have thought a very limited amount of sound could be heard but no not at all. This is no exaggeration - it sounded like there was a party in the living room and that is with both the master bedroom and bathroom doors closed. Not wanting to make a fuss I let it go - at around 1am I called the front desk and she said the nightclub goes until 4am and that I am not the first to complain. This is an ongoing complaint they have. Other hotel workers also said this is an ongoing problem and I was the 7th person that day to tell this story to my attendant.

We decided to try ,The Cosmopolitan, because it was the newest hotel on the strip and featured outdoor terraces. Check in was efficient and we received a gorgeous terrace suite with an awesome view of the strip as well as the Bellagio fountains. We had concerns about the lack of dresser drawers in the hotel but the large closets, huge storage chest and other drawers in the kitchenette compensated for this. Our room was also totally noise free and facing the Bellagio Fountains. We ate at \"The Wicked Spoon\", restaurant for dinners and breakfast and the food quality was outstanding! We loved the concept of having sides prepared in mini skillets. We also dined at The Henry Restaurant and the secret pizza place. Both were also good and the pizza place was convenient for a quick snack at any time of day or night. We did not use the outdoor pool but we took a tour of the main pool, spa and fitness facilities. The pool area covered the entire length of the Hotel facing Las Vegas Boulevard on the upper floor. It simulated a tropical Oasis. The fitness center featured the latest fitness equipment, including a regulation sized Boxing ring and boxing bags. The Spa was tranquill and serene. The aroma of the spa and the entire hotel is very refreshing without being overpowering. There was a small mix-up with our pre-paid bill but we were able to review it the night before on the hotel's flatscreen. The matter was resolved courteously at check out. The only slight dissapointment was the Signature Gift shop. They did not have a good selection of Cosmopolitan souveniers. We like to collect refrigerator magnets and other memos from our travels and the selection was quite limited.

When we arrived about 6:00 pm, and the premium view room that we paid for was not available, the girl was a little slow checking us in but it was worth the wait because she upgraded us to a one bedroom suite with the Bellagio fountain view. It was in the west tower which is what I had asked for when we got there as I did not want to hear the night club as per previous posts. Our view was of the Jockey Club roof but the fountains made up for that. We could still see the lights of the street north, beautiful view no matter what! It was also very quiet at that end of the resort. The room was beautiful. bathtub with a window which we sat in one night in a mass of bubbles watching the fountains! It could have been cleaned better. The bedding was clean but I did notice cup rings on the desk in living room which wiped off and little things that were dusty but all in all, it was comfortable. The bed and linens are to die for, we slept like babies but as other posts, it got a little hot because of the bedding. The room was actually cool in the living area we were just a little hot because we were curled up in the bed under the blankets because it was so comfortable. We ate at the Wicked Spoon Buffet for breakfast and it was excellent. We wanted to eat there again but just ran out of time! The hotel itself is huge and can be confusing but by the 2nd day we knew where we were and where we were going without going in circles for 10 minutes! The Chandelier Bar is amazing and the casino is fairly large, I did not think it was small like some posts! The only major complaint for us was only one coffee shop and being in the west tower it was a 5 minute walk to get a coffee in the morning, did not care for the coffee in the room, too weak for me, but the Va Benne Coffee Shop had the best cappacino (cant spell it!) We spent a morning at the Bamboo Pool, it was relaxing, we did not go to any of the other pools, I believe there was a charge for both and we wanted to relax not listen to loud music that day. The technology in the rooms that I have read so many complaints about was no problem for us, we could not figure out why people had so many problems! Easy to use and was very handy. There really were so many neat things about the room and hotel to name. The couch in the living room had a sofa bed which we thought great if you were sharing a room. The terrace furniture was comfortable but not placed right to view the fountain and when my husband tried to move it, it was heavy, weighted down with cinder blocks we thought. There were a few jerks that weekend, someone threw one of the pillow cushions from the patio furniture out on the roof along with a few slices of pizza but they were removed fairly quickly, too bad some had to act like that! The only thing we did not care for about the terrace was the fact that if you are out there and the neighbours are smoking, you could really smell it so we went in when they were out there and could not leave our door open for that reason. The other thing is that the railings are clear plastic with dots all over them and if you sit down and try to look out the dots are in your view and hard to focus on fountains, better view from the bathtub!

Both my husband and I have been to Vegas many times but this was our first trip in 2 years and we wanted to stay at one of the new hotels in the City Center area of the Strip. We were initially slightly concerned after reading some of the reviews prior to travel however we need not have worried. The first thing to mention about this hotel is the location. We were in the Eastside Tower on the 51st floor and to get from the room to the Strip took less than 5 minutes. CHECK IN We arrived on a Sunday at about 5pm and there was no queue at all at the check in desks. We were able to check in straight away and found the desk clerk to be friendly and helpful. We decided to upgrade to a premium view room and this was sorted with no fuss and we can find no fault at all with the service. THE ROOM We had a one bedroom suite with a premium view as mentioned. The view was spectacular and is a real selling point of the hotel. Being able to sit on the Balcony and watch the Bellagio fountains and gaze down the strip takes some beating and makes staying here a different experience from most Vegas hotels. The technology in the room, as others have mentioned, had a few glitches but on the whole worked ok. There is always the option to manually operate the lights etc so it was not a problem. We did have to call an engineer on one occasion as the TV in the bedroom was not working but this was sorted within 10minutes of placing the call. When we checked into the room we noticed a stain on the bedding and also that the slippers were missing. We called the Beck and Call service and both these issues were sorted within the hour. The telephone operative and the housekeeping staff were all polite and helpful \u2013 again no complaints about the service received. A minor complaint with the room would be the lack of coat hangers and storage space for clothes. If staying for a long weekend this would be ok but for a week it was not really sufficient but we managed. Also, the lack of a fridge was not ideal however we filled the kitchen sink with ice which kept our drinks cool so again this was not a big deal. We were careful not to move items in the fridge having read the previous reviews about charges to the bill! We did experience noise from the club and the fountains even with the door shut. However, we are both heavy sleepers and it did not bother us. If you are a light sleeper either you may want to take ear plugs or choose a room in the West tower as this may be quieter. THE SPA We both used the spa and our only slight disappointment was that the sauna, steam room area are not co-ed and we would have liked to enjoy this together. However, the treatments were first class. We are regular spa goers and the treatments here were some of the best we have had. In particular the massage from Kara deserves a mention. The spa receptionist was extremely friendly and helpful too. THE POOL We only used the Bamboo pool which is the quieter one. Plenty of shady spots for those who want to escape the blazing sun and a good waitress service for drinks and food (although we only sampled the drinks). The Boulevard pool area seemed much livelier if that is your thing you may prefer it. RESTAURANTS We sampled the breakfast buffet at the Wicked Spoon one morning and this was good although not a huge choice of items compared to some of the other buffets. The buffet at Bellagio we found to be much better value. We also had pizza from the \u2018hidden\u2019 pizza place one evening which was really tasty. We didn\u2019t try any of the other restaurants in the hotel as with the whole of Vegas to choose from we preferred to wander out and try other places. Overall we had an excellent stay and would not hesitate to come back.

Even with the snafu, I wouldn't hesitate to give this hotel 5-stars across the board. We've stayed at several properties on the strip- Wynn, Mandalay Bay and Paris, to name just a few, and we've really enjoyed our stay at each. But Cosmo- holy cow. Awesome to a whole new level. I LOVE Vegas, and hubby can take it or leave it, but we both agree, it will be really hard to stay anywhere else in Vegas after experiencing Cosmo. For reference, our stay was during the week- I mention it because I know weekends can get crazy. To get the bad out of the way first- we stayed 2 nights, and our room was never cleaned. We were really only expecting housekeeping for the first morning, and I blame it on just a lack of communication. Housekeeping knocked at about 11:30, but we weren't ready. They said they would come back. Throughout the day, a \"do not disturb\" sign appeared on our door, and no matter how many times we switched it to \"service please,\" when we returned it was turned back to \"do not disturb.\" So, blame it on kids or drunks in the hallway switching it? Possibly. I did call housekeeping and the front desk a couple of times and they told us we had been moved to the night shift, but by about 9:30 I finally just called and asked for fresh towels, which were delivered within 15 minutes. Since that was our only full day and we checked out right away the next morning, it wasn't a big deal, but if we had stayed longer I most certainly would have pressed the issue more. That being said, the stay was outstanding. Rooms were unbelievable- I'm spoiled now for sure. There is no way you can beat a balcony with a fountain view. Large, condo-like room, and a bathtub with a strip view! Just wonderful, roomy and very clean. We felt like high-rollers. Dining was fantastic- we ordered room service the first morning, and it was delivered within a half hour. Wonderful food, excellent service. The buffet is the best I've had in Vegas. The food really seemed to focus on quality, which is tough when having to push out quantity, too, but it was delicious. We also dined at China Poblano one evening and The Henry for breakfast, and each were very good- China Poblano was especially fun and different! We also had a small snack at Holstein's, which was great as well. The lounges were fabulous- Chandelier is beautiful, and Bond is very fun at night, when they get the music pumping and the go-go girls dancing. Specialty cocktails were wonderful- very different and interesting. Also loved the cocktails from the waitresses while gambling- not many places will happily bring you a cosmopolitan or chocolate martini while you're shoving $5 into a penny slot machine, but Cosmo will. Nice to have options for different pools- we hung out at the Marquee pool, which made us feel like rock stars. Lounged out on a big roomy chaise surrounded by pillows and listened to chill music while hubby swam in the pool. Waitresses were very friendly. Usually a place like that would make me feel a little uncomfortable for being a size 10 instead of a size 0, but I totally felt comfortable here. It had a very exclusive feel, without being pretentious. Service was excellent and friendly- I didn't talk to anyone who wasn't completely personable and helpful. Also loved that this hotel had an art focus- stacks of books about creativity in the room, interesting modern art throughout the hotel, and even a converted cigarette vending machine upstairs that vended art!

Massive room with two flat screen tvs, fantastic shower & tub bath overlooking the strip & what amazing sights & sounds of the strip from the outside balcony.

Fantastic pool areas, casino, bars restaurants, night/day clubs this place just excelled at everything but its definately a place for 21's upwards.

I confirmed everything I had booked by email before we left explaining being an international guest I would appreciate the room being ready as close to 3pm due to the long travel and they obliged. Noise - This Vegas its going to be loud just take time in choosing your room West Tower is I understand over the clubs so we stayed in the East on the 36th floor overlooking fountains and had no problem sleeping. Parking - Enter on Harmen which is off Vegas blvd drive past fountains ignore next right take the slip near lights as you enter its quite a tight turn. No need to Self Park use the Valet service very easy and none of this taking cases through casino the bell hop will bring the bags to your room just take anything for your immediate needs with you as we waited for about 30 mins from check in which considering the size of hotel was not a problem. Dont use the mini bar unless you are willing to pay high prices ( If you lift any item incl things from the top tray over 45 secs they get recorded on your folio !!) we found an ABC shop selling booze just over the bridge near Hard Rock take ID though. very cheap also sell snacks & things for light lunches. Ice is readily available on each floor so just fill the sink in suite with ice everything stayed cool all day. We checked daily the room charges just in case anything unusal showed up but in our case everything was fine. I was also advised to avoid arriving in Vegas on a Fri/Sat as its hetic all over so we arrived instead on Sunday and left Fri morning making the stay easy and drive out of Vegas without any hold ups.

The hotel ownership has obviously spent a good deal of time and money trying to make this a trendy spot. To that end I think they've succeeded. The hotel and Marquee (day and night) Club are drawing in a pretty hip crowd in droves. But like many pretty things, they can be lacking if you look too closely.... We had a Wraparound Suite which was everything (in the end) that I had read about and expected. Upon check in we were given our suite in the East Tower. The suite was on the 20th floor and looked out upon the roof tops of the Marquee complex. No fountain views...no real strip views... just buildings, roof tops and a sliver of the Marquee pool area. Upon my friends urging I called to the front desk and asked if we could move to the West Tower (where reception is), which they were able to oblige. This turned out to be WAY better in view. There are some cool aspects to the Wraparound Suite : kitchen, washer/dryer, two full bathrooms, HUGE terrace, comfy bed. There are no dishes in the kitchen, and bring your own washer/dryer supplies if you plan on using them. Now there are things that one could knit-pick: stains on the carpet, a few random leftover guest hairs here and there, NO WI-FI signal in our suite (despite the mandatory resort fee), a lightbulb in the bathroom that blew up and scattered broken glass across the floor when the switch was first turned on etc. BUT the #1 biggest negative for us was Marquee. As the Day Club starts in the morning and takes only a brief break in the later afternoon/evening to set up for the nighttime version it got to be old very quickly. We are relatively young (early thirties) and came to party, but there is no \"off\" switch for the booming base, loud music and drunk party people. Even with the doors shut the Marquee effect permeates into the suite day and night (winding down about 3:30am ish). This alone will likely prevent us from staying here again. Even in the non-summer months the nightclub rages on. I'm not really sure where you can go to escape this. Perhaps the opposite sides of both towers that do not face Marquee. The #2 biggest negative was the air conditioning. It was only in the mid 80's outside (April), but the inside air temp never got lower than 76 (despite being set on 65 and having the curtains shut). I must say it felt even warmer than that. We slept under just a sheet and were still waking up throughout the night due to the air temp. At night we opened the sliding doors to cool down the room. I can't imagine when the summer temp starts topping 100. Finally the pools.... Marquee Day Club charges for everything. You and a guest (if staying at the hotel) can get in for free without a cover, but if you want a lounge chair get out your credit card. The hotel pools : the Boulevard Pool and the Bamboo Pool are very small, so get there by 9 on the weekend for a chair. We got there about 10:30am on Saturday and it was packed! We were offered an oversized lounger that sits partly in the pool, for $300 with $200 going towards \"food and beverage\".. Sounded like a good deal, but the bill was brought out asap with $300+tax and 20% gratuity. Assuming the F&B credit would be applied as we ordered, we proceeded to order about $200 in food, then another bill came. We explained what we were offered, and the hostess said the girl who had told us was mistaken. Protests went nowhere.. Translation : about $570 total. (and note this was NOT a cabana). Bittersweet. In conclusion... I suggest this hotel only for during the week, away from the Marquee, or for dinner and drinks. The terraces are a very nice feature for Vegas, but unless you smoke, not really worth the downsides (in my humble opinion). Blue Ribbon Sushi is very good (and of course expensive). The hidden pizza joint is best for late night hangover prevention (to the right of Blue Ribbon sushi fyi). I do not know how this hotel will recoup the money spent on it. The Casino itself is quite sparse and sad compared to other casinos in the area, thus I don't think they are drawing the big gamblers. Marquee alone isn't gonna cut it. One other irk .... I checked in using my AMEX to cover the room. However, Cosmo used my debit card which I had used to pay the original deposit with two months ago. Result was $2000 \"pending\" (thus unusable) on my account for the entire stay (and three days after).", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago il", "Title": "\u201cstunning hotel\u201d", "Author": "lily v", "ReviewID": "UR105655206", "Content": "Loved this hotel.It is very different from the other hotels on the strip but in a good way.Best location in the middle of the strip,accross from the bellagio Checking in was smooth.The employee was friendly and upgraded us to a suite with wrap around balcony.The room was simply gorgeous,tastefully decorated and super clean.It had 2 large bathrooms,2 tvs,a kitchen,living room,a washer and dryer.One of the bathrooms had a big shower,the other one was even bigger with a shower and separate sinking tub.

I read all the reviews and I can tell you that the Hotel is nice but there are a few things that need work. Check In- The process was a little slow and what made it worse was the person checking me in was in training. I booked a room with a view and the front desk told me \"we do not block off rooms\"??? what in the world does that mean? Moving on, I did get a room with a view, but it wasn't the Bellagio fountain view from what I saw on the internet. Whatever! Room- The view was decent, clean and it lived up to my expectations. ONE issue. I did come to Vegas to party HOWEVER at some point I have to get some sleep. We were on the 68th floor and I could still hear, people screaming and music (drums beating) coming from a club. I believe the hotel has this issue with noise because of the fact that they have a sliding glass door versus a sealed glass window like the other hotels. I read about it and can tell you if your room faces the strip, YOU will hear noise from the street. More on the room..the toilet is separate from the bathroom, which could come in handy when everyone is getting ready in the bathroom. The 2 TV's in the room came in handy since my husband wanted to watch sports and I wanted to watch the travel channel. The bed was very comfy and pillows were top quality down and feather. Casino/Clubs- The Marque club was ALWAYS packed and there was ALWAYS a line to get into that place. We never made it in because we just did not have the patients to wait, we did inquire about VIP and it was $10,000!!! WHOA! I never heard of such a thing. The casino had lots of penny and 10 cent slot machines and the black jack table attendees were great. Food - The Wicked Spoon was OK at best. I did not expect much from a buffet however some of the food was cold and too salty for my taste. We went twice and the second time was for breakfast...I do not recommend you go for brunch or breakfast. The selection was mediocre and the pancakes were small and dry. The omelette station burned our omelettes and they add too much oil to the pans since they are making back to back omelettes for diners. Pool- It's small and it felt like a motel pool. It totally sucked. Don't waste your time. Check-Out - The process was very easy. They give you several ways to check out. Phone, tv or front desk. I chose the phone and I was completely aware of my folio balance since you can check it on the TV at any moment. Valet/Taxi- Just a warning, The valet service attendees are kind of brass. I often hailed my own cab and opened my own taxi door. A few times the attendees did open the doors for us but it was done with an attitude and a hustle in their step. Don't expect first class service here. Over all the hotel was nice, I had some friends staying at the ARIA and I highly recommend that hotel.

We arrived at the hotel and got in line for check in around 2:30pm on a Friday. Took us about 15-20 minutes to check in. As other travelers have noted it was disorganized as there were 3 lines and no one around directing people and as always we ended up picking the line that took the longest. Once we got to the desk the check in process was very quick. We booked this trip using our Marriott reward points and the clerk acknowledged our Marriott Platinum status and upgraded our room from a terrace studio to a one bedroom terrace \u2013 premium view on the 61st floor. Room 6179. Our room faced Planet Hollywood and we had an entire view of the strip. The room was remarkable. Clean, big and the balcony was great. The bathroom was amazing with the huge shower and the huge tub. There were windows in the bedroom that allowed you to see in the shower and bath tub. There were blinds that could be closed if you needed privacy which we did not use. The only downside was as other people have mentioned was the technology in the room. The lights could not be controlled from the TV. The option was there but it did not work. Also the one TV in the desk area would not work either, no picture would appear. The TV in the bedroom had problems as well. The guide would say something was on one channel but it was actually a different channel. I did not bother calling to have this fixed since I knew we would not be watching a lot of TV. Probably should have done so for the next person staying in that room. The bed was also very comfortable. My fianc\u00e9 also did not bring her trusty hair dryer and decided to chance it and use the hotel hair dryer which she loved. This allowed her to pack more shoes in her suitcase. Room was cleaned daily and timely and you were given plenty of towels and extras. The only downside was the storage space for clothes. Closet was huge but not a lot of shelf space but we managed. The rest of the resort was beautiful as well. The Chandelier bar is amazing and the casino is small but very nice. Seemed to be busy all the time. The only restaurant we ate at in the casino was the buffet for brunch and Holstein\u2019s. The buffet was amazing; all the food was fresh and a very big selection. Holstein\u2019s was ok but kind of expensive as does not compare to StripBurger. We also found the secret pizza place which really was not a secret. We went at 2am one morning and there were at least 50 people in line. Plus the map they give you when checking in has the pizza placed marked but still a little bit of a challenge to find it. Overall the pizza was good and made a good late night snack.

We had 11 in our group 5 rooms and no one had a complaint.We checked in early on Sunday morning at 10:30 and we checked our bags the rooms were not ready as we had expected. We gave our cell numbers and requested to be as close together as possible. We all received our calls by 2:30. Our rooms were altogether except for one which was one floor up but no big deal. We had 3 fountain view the other 2 were across the hall. We could hear the club 2 nights but were not right over it so it was not disturbing.The other rooms that face the fountain you could hear the water cannons but they were done by 12. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Our rooms were always cleaned no issues with that, there were no minibar charges as previously reported. I came back to my room for something and the maid was in there the previous day I had left a note with my tip this day I hadn't she asked if it was meant for her she wasn't going to take it unless she was sure. The one thing was replacing of the amenities in the bathroom but when we asked for things we did get them. I didn't get to the pool but many in our group did and enjoyed them.

We had 4 people per room and paid extra to reserve citirooms with 2 queen beds in them through hotelplanner.com. When we arrived, we were told that they did not have any citirooms available and we had been \"up-graded\" to a terrace suite. This room only had 1 bed and was above the marquee club. The front desk clerk told us he would have 2 cots sent up to our room (this was about 5:30 PM.) We got to the room and waited and waited for the cots. Finally we called housekeeping and discovered the front desk had never requested the cots. We waited some more. At 11:00 PM we were told it would be another hour for the cots. We finally got the cots at 2:00 AM and they had no blankets on them. I ended up using a bathrobe to try and keep warm through the night. Add to that, the music from the club (we could hear the DJ clear enough to make out the words) and we had a terrible night's sleep. This was really bad for us because we had to be at the soccer fields at 8:00 AM for a 9:00 AM game the next morning (which we lost due to fatigue.) The next day we were moved to a citiroom with 2 queen beds, but the smart TVs and half of the lights did not work. Also, we kept knocking over items in the mini-bar trying to put our water bottles in the fridge. Becasue the mini-bar items are on pressure sensors, we kept having to call the front desk and explain that we had not used any items and ask to have to charges removed from our bill. This hotel is too expensive to have these kinds of problems. Finally the cost of drinks was completely outrageous. I got a premixed pina-colada (tasted like what you get at the grocery store) at the pool for $14. I ordered an apple-jack on the middle floor of the chandelier bar and was told I would have to go to the top floor to order that particular drink.

We were a little hesitant since it is a newer resort and Vegas has so many wonderful options. I can say we thoroughly enjoyed the hotel and would stay there again. Some thoughts and opinions: ROOM ON EAST SIDE We had a room on the East Tower with a nice balcony on the 18th floor. I was pleasantly surprised. The decor of the hotel is beautiful and very South Beachy, which is a good thing in my opinion. There was a nice chaise lounge on the balcony of the room where you could chill out and have a drink that comfortably seats 2. One drawback is if there is a concert (and there was Friday and Saturday) the music plays until about midnight. No way to sleep until then, so if you are going for business and sleep is important to you I would make sure you don't get a room on that side near the pool. If you enjoy the music you can actually lean over your balcony and pretty much see the whole concert at the pool. The rooms were very large with comfy robes provided and C.O. Bigelow bath products. Mine even had a dishwasher (odd since the only items in the room were a pair of wineglasses) and a microwave. Maid service was good. I also had a sitting room with a large l shaped couch. There was a separate tub and shower which was nice. Small drawback is they charge for coffee. There was pod coffee machine in the room. For $5 I think you got you got sugar, 2 creamers, some sweet and low, a couple of regular cofee pods (good for one cup each), a decaf pod and a green tea pod. I was slightly disappointed as I drink a lot of coffee, but overall the price was not bad for it. The bed was great-very comfy. PARKING One thing I very much enjoyed was there was self parkign that was free so you could easily obtain your car and not have to wait for the valet (which is incidentally also free). The only time I had an issue finding a parking space was on Saturday night at about 9:00. I think the whole town must know they don't charge for parking and park there. They don't check if you are a guest or not (at the time of writing this) when you park so anyone can park there. MARQUEE If you are a hotel guest you and a guest get in free to to the Marquee club at Cosmopolitan. I must warn you the crowd to get in on a Saturday night was outrageous. You don't get special treatment if you are a hotel guest and have to wait in line with everyone else , if you are lucky enough to get in. If you are serious about going I would get there early. The crowd at 9:30 on a Saturday waiting to get in was waaaay too long. The bouncer told me they were almost at capacity at that time anyway. CROWD I would defintely say it was a younger, hip crowd. The average age was under 30. I wouldn't dress schlumpy. Bring some hot clothes if you are going to stay here. OVERALL Overall, the staff was very nice and helpful. Watch out for the mini bar. It is one of those that automatically charges after 45 seconds of the item being lifted. There was a charge on my account when I briefly picked up and looked at a pair of biniculors they were selling. The charge was taken off by very helpful staff memeber when I called. I can absolutely recommend this hotel. It's not as huge as some of the others which makes it easier to get around, but it is super nice.

As in some other reviews we had a problem with the housekeeping too. By 3:30 in the afternoon our room hadn't been cleaned and there were no housekeeping staff in the halls. I called housekeeping on the phone and asked if the room could please be cleaned ( we had been out of the room for more than 6 hours) The lady said she would have someone take care of it. When I returned at 5:30 to shower and dress for dinner the room had been cleaned, but none of the little bottles of shampoo etc had been replaced. I went down the hall to the housekeeping area and knocked on the door to ask for the shampoo etc. I was greeted very well and given more bottles than I could have used if I was staying for another week. Why couldn't they just replace them at the time they clean the rooom? I think at the rates they are charging for a stay at this hotel it is very cheap not to replace items. Alittle nickel and diming from the management. NOT GOOD! Another thing that bothered me was they charged for every little thing that you might need. Example--the coffe/tea box included in the very expensive mni bar was $5.00. I have stayed and some very nice and expensive hotels in my years of traveling and have Never had a coffee pot provided and then be asked to buy the coffee. Again another example of the nickel and diming that is going on. On the positive side; the room was very nice with a great view of the Belligio fountains. Enjoyed the Blvd pool. It over looked the Las Vegas Blvd. In general if you like the young 20/30 something life style with all there noise and aggressive behavior then this is the hotel for you.

My boyfriend told me to be calm and ask to talk with the manager, and I am glad I listened to him. They upgraded us to the wrap around terrace and all my anger was instantly washed away. Can't guarantee everyone will get this lucky, but if you tell them it's a special occasion you might. There were issues with the TV's, they didn't work at all, but placing a call to \"beck and call\" an IT guy was there within the half hour and fixed the TV's, but could not get the room features working since they had just started to open up the floor we were staying on two weeks prior. This didn't bother us, we just turned the lights on/off the old fashioned way, and if we wanted to check our bill we just called the front desk and they happily gave us an update on our room charges. Customer service was very good throughout the hotel, front desk at check in were a little stuffy, but they were very swamped the night we checked in. We stayed in the West Tower which was quiet, but I can see how the people in the East Tower would complain of the noise...It was noisey over there, just bring earplugs in case you end up in the East. There was someone that posted earlier about bringing Senseo coffee pods instead of paying for thier coffee pods, this did work, BUT there is NO sugar or creamer either so unless you like your coffee black bring all the fixin's! We even brought plastic spoons, knives and forks, just in case. If you need stuff you could always walk to the CVS (not to far, but you have to wind through city center to get to it) it is located to the right of the hotel on the strip, There is also places to buy cheaper beer and wine that direction. You can have the fridge emptied for $25, but be careful what you wish for, you might decide you wanted a snack or a juice later and if you happen to be in the West Tower it is a very long walk to the main hotel for these things. Oh yeah, make sure you bring your ID to the pools you might need it especially at the Day Club Pool. We actually did very well at the tables (roulette) in the Cosmo, paid for our dinners and drinks the rest of the week :) Ladies bring you own soap/shampoo the one's they have in the room really dry you out, and moisterizer IS A MUST it is sooo dry out there. I'm from the east coast so I wasn't prepared for this. For the people that didn't get a good room cleaning maybe you should've tip the housekeeper like we did.

I gave this 5 stars because even though there were problems, the hotel remedied the problems right away, and ended up having a great time there. Would definately go back.

I went to give a 30 minute talk, but extended my stay a bit. It was in the Cosmopolitain, so I stayed there out of convenience. I ALWAYS stay in the Wynn....and I can tell you we love the Wynn- the Cosmo is WAY, WAY, FAR AWAY FROM THE WYNN IN TERMS OF QUALITY-- MUCH WORSE, MUCH LOWER CLASS. The good: rooms are actually pretty big, but weird- have little kitchens, laundry, obvoiusly because it was condos originally that went under, so it retained the condo feel. The lobby is modern, faily clean. There's a choice of several nice restaurants on the 3d floor plus shopping and coffee shops, and they're 4 star (not 5...no way). In all fairness, not terrible. THE BAD: service SUCKS!. Check-in takes 30-4 minutes! The elevators to go up or go down, during many hours of the day, take 30 minutes to just get to your room!!! THIS IS RIDICULOUS, UNACCEPTABE, AND A CONSTANT SOURCE OF FIGHTING, SHOVING, MOBBING INTO WHAT SEEMS LIKE THE ONE WORKING ELEVATOR OUT OF 6, MAKING US ALMOST REFUSE TO GO UP OR DOWN-- ELEVATORS ARE INSANELY BAD! Next- the pool scene is cheap and basically sucks. Cheesey music, bad service, pool is sub-par. Not as ridiculous as 45 minute waits for elevators, but still pretty bad. The massage/Hammam is bad: not nice for a spa. No where EVEN CLOSE to the Wynn. Also: LOUD, club music audible in all rooms of the hotel lasting until 6am. everyone in my group of 50 guys said that they heard techno beats all night. Overall: not awful...but honestly SUCKED.

This is definitely a younger crowd of people who like the newness and very luxurious setting. You can tell the staff has been told to get into the theme of the hotel, which what I would consider is a modern day \"rat-pack\", party-all-night-but-always-look-sexy theme. This may be a Marriott Autograph Collection hotel, but it definitely does not feel like an Marriott property. This can be good or bad to any Marriott Rewards member like myself. If anything, it adds to the diversity of Marriott properties. I don't know how the Marriott network works in these situations, but if Marriott tries to educate the staff on Marriott Hospitality, I contend it will be a very popular hotel and casino in the future. Maybe it's the rat-pack atmosphere that makes some of the staff somewhat cocky - but some of the staff could still be more hospitable and, in general, more friendly. Particularly unfriendly was some of those of what Marriott considers/considered \"Loss Prevention\" - essentially hotel security. I concede it's difficult to determine who is a guest and who is just a passer-by - but to treat everyone like they're just thugs off the street is just plain wrong. From just exploring the hotel and being told the pool was closed, or trying to get a closer look at their recent cold water pipe burst - it seems it's never their fault, it's yours. The unfriendliness or impatience could be human resource related. The property seems understaffed in a lot of different locations - and one of my breakfasts in the Wicked Spoon seemed like the host staff was running around like chickens with their heads cut off. So glaringly apparent was the lack of staff, we didn't even worry that no one brought our drink order and threw down a second bottle of water on the table instead. As for the room itself, it was very modern and chic. Very roomy and comfortable. The remote and TV (as a \"monitor\") can control the lights, room temperature, and even help you look up menus of where to eat that day on the property. It was probably the most wired/technologically advanced room I've ever stayed in. To be picky, the on-TV interactivity was very, very slow and buggy but it worked eventually. It probably would not be user-friendly to your older parents or grandparents. It was nice to have free WiFi. Given that it is a Marriott location, I know I will stay here again. I'll be more prepared next time for the staff and I can only hope it's only growing pains. I urge Marriott to be more closely involved in human resource training if they want to continue listing this as a Marriott property on their website.", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hillsborough, NJ", "Title": "\u201cGreat to have a \"Marriott\" hotel on the strip in Vegas\u201d", "Author": "HeyMan76", "ReviewID": "UR104316857", "Content": "I have a new favorite hotel in Vegas. The Cosmopolitan has it all. Great rooms, unbelievable views (from huge balconies no less), top notch restaurants, bars , casino and one of the best locations on the strip. The Cosmopolitan is nothing less than first class all the way. It's great to have a hotel in Vegas that wasn't designed around a \"theme\". It's not trying to make you feel like your in Paris, Venice, Rome or anywhere else. The Cosmopolitan takes on a Manhattan or South Beach \"boutique\" feel even though it has 3,000 rooms, three pools and more than twenty restaurants and bars. The icing on the cake is that it's part of Marriott's Autograph Collection so as a Marriott Gold or Platinum Elite member, you get all the perks you would normally receive at a branded Marriott property. Room upgrades, free breakfast, etc. And here's something refreshing even if you're not a Marriott Elite member, The Cosmopolitan has no resort fees and there is no fee to access the internet. Unlike some of the previous reviews, we experienced only great service and a room that technologically worked perfectly. The only glitch we experienced was that housekeeping didn't show one day. After contacting the front desk in the early evening, fresh towels were promptly delivered to our room and our spa charge for that day was taken off our bill. The rooms are spacious and have a modern decor. I had booked the least expensive City Room with the hope that my Elite status would get me upgraded. At check-in, the front desk recognized my status and upgraded me to a Terrace One Bedroom Premium View on the 35 floor of the west tower with a view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains. The Terrace One Bedroom Suites have a nice size living room with a circular sofa, chairs, desk and a large flat screen TV. There is a small kitchen area with a microwave, dishwasher and refrigerator. Down side with the fridge is that it's stocked with pressure sensitive mini-bar items. If you try to put anything else in it or move anything, you'll see a charge on your bill. Between the living room and the bedroom (which is separated by pocket doors), there is a nice size dressing area. The bathroom has a separate water closet, dual sinks and large walk-in shower and Japanese tub area. The only thing missing in the bathroom (especially for a hotel as modern as the Cosmopolitan), was a built in TV. The bedroom has floor to ceiling windows and a walk-out onto a large balcony with oversize chairs and table. The entire room can be controlled by your TV remote with menus displayed on the TV. You can control each light in the room individually, in groups by room or you can even set \"moods\". For the technologically challenged, you can always just control each light from the switch on the wall. You can also control the room temperature, take virtual tours, make reservations and a lot more. There are three pools. The Bamboo pool, The Marquee Day Club pool (adults only and make sure you bring your I.D. regardless of your age or you'll be turned away), and the Boulevard pool. The largest of the three is the Boulevard pool. It's made up of two pools, a large hot tub and multiple levels of comfortable chaise lounges, day beds and cabanas. Since there is a charge for the day beds and cabanas, you'll need to get to the pool early to get a prime chaise lounge location. There is also a unique sporting area at the pool that includes multiple pool tables, ping pong tables and Foosball tables along with a bank of 9 large flat screen TV's. The gym and spa at the Cosmopolitan are nice but not among the best in Vegas. The decor in the spa is dramatic with its two story tall sandstone walls but beyond that, the rest of the spa was pretty standard and actually on the small side for a property this big. If you want to go a few rounds in the gym, there is a boxing ring, heavy bags and gloves. The buffet is called The Wicked Spoon and while we only had breakfast there (at no charge if your a Marriott Gold or Platinum member ), it was excellent and among the best in Vegas.

Nice view and yes I did bring my ear plugs because of the night club on that side of the hotel. (Thanks to all who gave me the earplug advice!) The room was spacious and clean. Nice balcony also. There was never a problem with maid service and never used room service. The pizzeria place was really good. The first night there I ate at the DOCG restaurant and that was the best meal I had at the hotel. Also ate at Comme Ca and was not impressed but I am not a regular eater of french food so to someone else it might have been great. I did eat lunch one day at the China Poblano in the hotel. In my opinion that was just fair also. The casino was great and the staff was friendly. The Chandelier bars are really cool. The Marquee night club brings the young crowd in. Right now it is the hot spot of Vegas. I did not venture in but from the line outside I would advise ladies to bring your little black dress and high heels and you will fit right in! I did use the convention meeting rooms as I was there for business and the only item that could be a problem for a big convention could be bathrooms. The continental breakfast each day was very good.

To cut a long story short, our room wasn't ready and after we came back 2 hours later, we accept an angle suite (larger than average suite with 2 bathrooms) for the night and a food and beverage credit to apologise for the inconvenience. Moving the next day was smooth and easy with one of the check in managers overseeing the move for us. The room was great with a good view overlooking Bellagio and the strip. We arrive back in the evening on Day 2 to a bottle of bubbly and chocolate dipped strawberries to wish us a Happy Anniversary and a hand written note from the manager who looked after us. A really nice touch. The staff throughout the rest of our stay were all friendly and accommodating. We ate at Scarpetta, China Poblano, the Wicked Spoon buffet and the pizza place. Scrapetta was wonderful and for my husband, it was as good as Prime at Bellagio. China Poblano was just ok, but I think this is simply down to our tastes. The buffet and pizza place were great, and the pizza place is a real bargain at $3-$4 a slice. The casino limits were a little higher than we'd like, so we played nearby and only played slots at Cosmo. I ordered a chocolate martini with a cocktail waitress one evening and ended up with baileys in a fancy glass. I should have asked for my tip back..... Hopefully, this was a one-off occurrence. I also used 'beck and call' service to request a larger bathrobe, as they were both medium. It appears they only have the one size. A shame really...... The radio channels via the tv are all mixed up, so you may select pop and end up with blues etc. I think the hotel has had some trouble in resolving this. The suites also have full kitchen but no plates, silverware etc. I believe you can request this, but we didn't request this. The free wireless worked great from our anywhere in our suite and also anywhere else in the hotel. We loved the hotel, the location and the service.

The lift was weird at first it is hard to find the key clot and you have to get it just right to be able to choose the floor. The 3 rooms were all different but great. Room 1 for 3- two queen beds, very big room, not a great view. Second room for 2- similar but smaller floor space but view of Bellagio fountains/ Paris.

The negatives- no little coffee shops -the direct you to Va Benne but it isnt like other hotels were you have Starbucks typ cofee shops. The music in the hotel bars is excruciatingly loud (but then we were all between 48 & 55) it is impossible to sit and chat in a bar in the evening due to this. The location of the hotel is great. There is a door right next to the Bellagio fountains and botht he Deuce and the Express bus stops there. A short walk to Paris on the other side of the road gets the same for the opposite direction.

The bell desk is a bit eager to take your luggage, and it takes about 15-20 minutes for them to get it to you, so hold on to it if you need it immediately when you get to your room.

My husband and I planned our first trip to Las Vegas back in January when the Cosmopolitan had literally just opened. We booked it primarily because of the location and also the balconies in each of the units. We also thought that it'd be great to stay in the newest place on the Strip. After choosing the Cosmo, we kept reading the reviews here on Tripadvisor. And we'll admit that the reviews made us very nervous! In fact, at one point, we called our travel agent to see if we could change hotels (we thought maybe we should stay at one of our other initial choices -- the Bellagio or the Venetian), but were told that a change wasn't possible. And so the Cosmo it was! We just crossed our fingers that we had a positive experience... Just as background, my husband and I are 35 and 34 respectively. We've done a ton of traveling during our relationship, but haven't done nearly as much traveling in the past four years (having kids does get in the way :)). We love staying at a wide variety of accommodations (depending on where we are in the world), but of course, when planning our first trip to Vegas -- our first trip just the two of us in 4 years! - we wanted to stay top-of-the-line. Let me begin this review by saying that not only did we find all of the reviews that we'd read to be untrue in our case, but the Cosmo exceeded our expectations in every single way. We absolutely loved it! So here's as thorough a review as I can possibly give: CHECK-IN: We arrived from Toronto at 3:00p.m. Normally, the stated check-in time is 3:00, but we'd read so many negative reviews about rooms not being ready until hours later, that we really didn't expect our room to be ready. And yet it was! We stood in line for about 5 minutes. Yes, it's true that they have a bit of a weird set-up (there are about 5 different lines that make their way to 10 different check-out counters), but they do have staff trying to direct people. And hey, the lobby/registration area is beautiful -- and so it gives you time to take it all in :) We had a lovely girl at the check-in counter and she was fantastic (thank you Abby!). We were our regular, pleasant Canadian selves and we got along with her fabulously. Next thing you knew, she was upgrading us (free of charge)! We had booked a terrace studio, but not a premium view (we had wanted to book a premium view, but our carrier (Sunwing) doesn't provide those rooms yet -- hopefully they will soon). When we got to the desk, we didn't start demanding an upgrade (something that our check-in girl told us really bothers all of the staff), but instead were just friendly. And we got upgraded to a 1-bedroom suite! She told us that the only 1-bedroom suites were not a premium view (of the Bellagio fountains, etc.), but that it would be a good view nonetheless. We traipsed out of the West Tower (which is where the registration desk is) to the East Tower towards our room -- with our bags. And yes (as other reviews have mentioned), it meant that we were walking all the way through the hotel's casinos with our luggage. This wouldn't have been necessary if we had stayed in the west tower, but needed to be done to get to the East Tower. It didn't bother us in the least. And then we arrived at our room... THE ROOM: We got placed on the 56th floor of the East Tower (room 5685 to be exact). We walked in... and almost couldn't help ourselves from jumping with joy! The room was SPECTACULAR. It was a one-bedroom suite which meant that we had a living room (with a kidney-shaped blue velvet couch, big 50\" plasma, little kitchenette (yes, useless.... but we'd learned from the reviews and just didn't touch the fridge or mini-bar for fear of charges). The living room led into a dressing area with big closets and a sitting bench... Every details was spectacular ... the wallpaper was amazing, leather wainscotting... Further on in the room came the bathroom. There was a big sink area and a separate toilet room, but the coup-de-grat was the shower/bath area. It was an open-concept shower leading to a lovely Japanese soaking tub overlooking a window with a view of the strip. It was unbelievable. The windows from the shower and the bath opened to the bedroom area (although you could close the blinds completely for privacy). The bedroom area had a big huge bed, another 50\" plasma, side tables with lamps and night lights and led to the amazing balcony. The balcony was huge and the view from the balcony was amazing. No - we didn't have the view of the beautiful Bellagio fountains (and after seeing the fountains and falling in love with them, we probably would have tried harder for this view next time), but we had a lovely view of City Center, and toward the airport. We could see the mountains and a plane took off every 30 seconds... it was awesome to watch. We happened to hit a very cold streak of weather while we were there and so didn't make great use of the balcony, but loved having it nonetheless. The bedroom had pocket doors that we closed when we were ready for sleep and once we closed all of the various curtains and blinds, the room was so dark that it was heavenly. The bed was extremely comfortable... And I should mention that because the hotel only opened in December, the rooms are almost brand new. In fact, I almost felt like we were the first guests to stay in our room! A great feeling (especially compared to the reports of dilapidated rooms at other hotels). HOUSEKEEPING/MAINTENANCE: We had two issues here. First, the drain in our soaker tub wasn't working. We stopped by the front desk and told them. They sent someone up within about 15 minutes. Granted, the front desk people had relayed the wrong message (that our shower was clogged and so he had brought the wrong tools), but he was extremely pleasant and the problem fixed within about 5 minutes. The second issue. We had our room cleaned each day. We didn't have any issues with the job that they did (except that there was an empty pack of cigarettes from the previous guests on our balcony and it lasted there the entire time). But the second day, my husband left a tip for the housekeeper and when we got back from our morning's outing (at 1:00p.m.), the tip was gone, but the room hadn't been cleaned or made up at all! My hubbie made a quick call to the concierge desk and explained. By the time we'd left and got back about 2 hours later, the room had completely cleaned (and the concierge apologied profusely). Not sure what happened, but it was rectified quickly. THE LOCATION: Honestly, the Cosmopolitan has the absolute best location of all of the hotels. If you haven't been to Vegas before, you'll fail to realize in advance how big the strip actually is! If you're staying at one end of the strip, it can be over an hour's walk to the other end! Well, the Cosmopolitan was built in the absolute centre of the strip. It was squeezed in between the Bellagio and the new City Center. It's in the middle of the strip, which means that it's about half an hour to get to either end of the strip. Being directly beside the Bellagio also means that one whole half of the hotel provides views of the Bellagio and it's spectacular fountains. And the other upside to the Cosmo's location is that it's situated directly off the street. Most of the \"resorts\" on the strip are so large that they are built almost a quarter mile back off the main strip. By the time you get back to your resort after a day's walking, you do not feel like walking all the way back to the entrance to these hotels, trust me. But the Cosmo (the East Tower) is built literally one step off of the main sidewalk. And the elevators up to the rooms are only about 20 steps from there. It's awesome. That was a HUGE plus. THE CASINO & THE \"VIBE\": As with other Vegas hotels, the casino takes up the entire main floor of the hotel. But of course, this casino is brand new and it is spectacular. It is surrounded by beautiful bars, it is crowned with jewels and decorated beautifully. It doesn't have that same \"basement\" feel that many of the hotel casinos have... In fact, it's got a great vibe. The music is great and the clientele is great too. The casino was never overly busy, but packed in nicely at popular times. The hotel is definitely the \"it\" place to be right now and so the clientele is beautiful and fun. We're not huge gamblers and so I can't really comment on the machines/tables/odds/dealers of this casino over others, but all seemed comparable. Another plus to this hotel is that it's new and so the smoke hasn't permeated the entire place yet. Yes, there is still smoking permitted in all of the casinos and in some of them, the smell of stale smoke and new smoke is overwhelming. But in the Cosmo, the newness of the hotel means that this isn't yet a problem, which was great! THE DECOR: This hotel is amazing. The designers were geniuses -- every detail was gorgeous. The black/white/pink/silver colour motif was awesome. The furniture was cool and modern. No details were overlooked (the artwork was incredible, the hotel makes great use of technology, etc.). It's a gorgeous hotel. THE NOISE FACTOR: For the most part, the hotel was not noisy. The casino didn't have that same \"noise factor\" that same of the other casinos had (e.g. no \"dinging\" of machines). My hubbie and I noted on many, many occasions that the room hallways were extremely quiet. In fact, in the 4 days that we were there, we never saw another soul on our floor (not even coming in or out of their room). It was weird! It was so quiet that it actually had a calming effect as you walked to your room :) And for the most part, our room was quiet. As I say, we were in the East Tower and on the 56th floor. That said, evenings got noisy. On Thursday and Friday nights, it got a bit noisy from the bars/clubs, but by the time we returned to our room at 3:00a.m., it was quiet and we slept beautifully. On the Saturday night, it was a bit of a different story. When we were in our room at about 12:00 midnight, it was so loud that we didn't know how we'd ever sleep. As you've probably heard in the other reviews, the club is on the 7th floor of the East Tower. If you really want to avoid the club, request the West Tower (although the location of the West Tower just isn't nearly as good). On the Saturday night, it was loud. Very loud. Even with the doors and curtains closed, you could hear the music pounding. If you were trying to sleep and aren't used to music, it would be impossible. We headed out again, and by the time we got back to the room at 3:00a.m., the music had been turned down slightly. You could still hear it, but we didn't have a problem falling asleep. THE STAFF: Honestly, we found the staff to be fantastic. Over the top great. In fact, there was part of us that thought that the hotel had read all of the negative reviews about the service and told the staff to turn it completely around. Every single staff member we came into contact with (checkin, identity membership, conciege, check-out, casino staff, maintenance, servers)... each and every one of them was amazing. We actually started to joke (in reference to the negative reviews)... \"What horrible people work here...\" :). Honestly, they were great. Upbeat, fun, nice and helpful. THE RESTAURANTS: We ended up eating at a few of the hotel's restaurants. First, we ate at Holstein's. We both liked our burgers, but didn't find them anything special. Then we ate at China Poblano. It was a last-minute decision and we ended up loving it! We ate some of the tacos (carnitas, fish, beef) and also ate their signature chinese \"Street Sandwich\". It was incredible. On our last day, we had breakfast at Le Henry and it was fantastic. I ate the french toast and my hubbie had the corned beef hash and we loved both (oh, and the lovely squeezed orange juice). THE CLUBS: My husband still loves to go clubbing when he gets the chance and I embraced the chance to get out to the nightclubs while away from the kids. On Thursday, after we first arrived, we went to the bouncers outside of the Marquee. We had heard that the Marquee was THE place to be and wanted to find out about strategies for getting in (we're in our mid-thirties and now simply refuse to stand in line for 3 hours!). The bouncer was nice and told us to come on Thursday night. Because Thursdays are a big night at Tao (at the Venetian), it's much more reasonable at the Marquee. They only open one room (the \"Boombox room\") but it was a lot of fun. Our hotel key got us in for free and past any line and we had a great time. The dj was great (a wide range of music) and everyone was having a good time. Friday and Saturday night were a different story. We actually met up with some extended family and headed to the clubs at The Palms on Friday night, but saw the Marquee when we got back. Even at 2:00a.m., the line was still going strong. Young people everywhere (very young, completely decked out, etc.). It was a bit of a zoo. It was nothing that bothered us at all -- but if you're one that doesn't like to be surrounded by a super-young crowd, it's something to be aware of. And Saturday night was even worse! The line-up was still extremely wrong and a bit crazy at 3:30a.m. (the start of a couple of fights, drunken young people, etc.). What was good was that the \"overflow\" of people meant the casino and bars were full of young people all decked out, ready to have a great time. THE POOLS/DAYCLUB: As I say, we hit some very bad (cold) weather and so didn't spend a lot of time at the pools. But on Sunday, before we left in the late-afternoon, we had a chance to hang out at some of the pools. First of all, it was the Grand Opening (ever) of the Marquee Dayclub. We got in free with our hotel key and it was great. It was sunny and beautiful, the dj was great and it was cool to see. It wasn't packed by the time we had to leave, but we had a fun time. They did a beautiful job -- nice pools, palm trees, private cabanas (with private jacuzzis)... it's a great looking place. We also hung out for an hour at the pool on the 4th floor. It's a great area. The loungers are comfortable, the pools are warm, the jacuzzi is great, they have ping pong and pool outside, which was awesome. They have tv's right there... the music/vibe was great. We ate lunch there and it was fine (nothing too special, but still good). All in all, if we'd hit warmer weather, we would have been happy to spend some time there! ALL IN ALL: Well, this has turned into a \"novel\" of a review (I can't believe how long it is!). :) But honestly, we really loved this hotel and felt that it deserved our good review. The Cosmopolitan was fantastic in every way and played a big part in us having such a wonderful trip. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel and in fact, I've already told friends that the Cosmo is THE place to stay in Vegas. I truly believe that when we return to Vegas over the years, we will stay at the Cosmo each and every time.", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAwful, worst hotel experience in 20 years\u201d", "Author": "speedtraplondon", "ReviewID": "UR103885551", "Content": "Arrived looking forward to a really stylish new hotel and found a hotel with little or no management process and little internal communication.

I had read all the reviews and decided that this is where we wanted to be. We picked a Terrace Suite to insure that we had a fountain view. Overall, I loved this hotel. We went in with an open mind and, if not for a few areas, this review would have a 4* or even a 5* rating. Maybe, next year things will change. I will break down our experience into the following categories: the outstanding, the very good, the good and the bad. THE OUTSTANDING Location, location, location. We were in the middle of everything. Absolutely, the best location on the strip. The view. I had not told my husband any of the specifics of where we were staying. (He just goes along with the flow). When we walked in the room, at about 10:30pm and he saw the view, he was blown away. It was that good. We both spent many hours out on the balcony just looking, day and night. The view of the Bellagio fountains and the strip were amazing. The bedding. Just great, comfortable, crisp and new. It doesn't get better than this. The pillows and mattress were great and so comfy. THE VERY GOOD: The front desk. We were brought in to the front desk by a person, I think he was a bellman. He waited and brought us to a very nice woman behind the desk. Since we had a terrace suite, I knew that our view was of the fountains and didn't want to mess with that, so didn't ask for an upgrade. We got what we paid for and were very happy. She accomodated us well. We were on the 46th floor of the West Tower. At checkout I, again, encountered another front desk person who was equally or better that the check in person. I will explain this later in the housekeeping section. The restaurants. We sampled many of the restaurants and found them all to be of above average to very good quality. We went to the buffet, the Wicked Spoon twice, once for breakfast and once for lunch. Both experiences were very good. The food was tasty and hot and the service was what you would expect at a buffet. We went to the Henry twice, once for breakfast and once for a late night dinner. Both times the service was good and the food was tasty. It was what we expected and we were happy with it. Room Service. Only had this once for a late night dinner. It was okay. The food was good and the server was fine. STK. We always try to go to one steak house where ever we go. STK did not disappoint. My filet was tasty and cooked to order and my husbands rib-eye was very good. Service was friendly, but a little off. At one point, our waiter poured water into my gin and tonic. He quickly replaced it, so no problem there. Estiatorio Milos. Greek seafood. We really love it. We picked our own seabass and they brought it to the table and deboned and served it to us. Healthy and tasty. Very nice. Service was very good. VaBene Caffe. Decent coffee, not the best if you are a starbucks fan, but it did the job. The pastries were out of this world. I had one, my husband had a few and we were not disappointed. Holsteins. Very good burgers. Tasty and good quality. Service was slow and distracted. Our server lost another patrons credit card and until he found it, we felt as if we were a burden to him.. After he found it(half way through our meal), he lightened up a little, but still the poorest restaurant service we experienced. Continuing with the very good. The dealers at the tables. They were friendly and knew their games. Really enjoyed playing at the casino. Cocktail waitresses. Were usually there withing 5 minutes and came back often. Very nice and helpful. Great service. The Good: The stores. They had what we needed and were friendly. Wine prices were not too expensive and there were some snacks. The blow dryer in the room was a full size dryer, no need to take one from home. In fact, since we had two bathrooms, we had two blow dryers. The concierge. She was helpful, but obviously new at her job. We wanted to rent a car and although she was helpful, we were the first car rental customers she had ever served. That being said, she did a great job and she got us what we wanted. The pools were beautiful, yet small as compared to some others. There was plenty of space, probably because it was early April. My husband had a hot stone massage and said it was very good, so I guess the spa was okay also. Since, I didn't experience it myself, I can only go on what he said. Now, the BAD: The room was very hot. We had to keep the doors open at night before we went to bed to cool it off. We had the temperature set at the lowest temp possible, but it was still very warm. Not at all a deal breaker, but comfort is important. And the most disappointing part of our stay; the housekeeping. I really tried to keep an open mind after reading all of the reviews. However, I have to concur. The housekeeping department really needs to get their act together. On our first day, the housekeeper knocked on our door at 3 pm asking if we wanted service. We said yes and vacated the room. The rest of the time, if we wanted housekeeping we had to call (except for our last day). On the last day a young woman knocked on the door at about 11am and asked if we needed housekeeping. I said yes, but could they please come back in an hour. She said, no problem. We came back to our room at 6 pm and it had not been cleaned. Everything needed to be replaced. I felt that I had been pretty understanding during the week, calling Beck and Call when I needed things that weren't replaced. However, at this point I was kind of glad we were leaving the next day. Ok, what led me to this. Two days before, I had called for housekeeping and when we returned, the room was very clean. However, there was a note from the housekeeper, stating that he saw that there were $20 of chips on the desk, with other items and assumed that they were his. If we had not meant them for him, we were to call him at his cell # to get them back. Never, never, in many trips to Vegas and AC, has this happened to us. No, the chips were not meant for him. When I brought this up to the front desk, the woman totally agreed with me. She offered that we could file a complaint. We turned this down. She stated that she had never heard of this happening and that she would bring it up with her supervisors. She was gracious and comped our room service fee as a way to compensate for this behavior. Believe me, this did help. It wasn't the money, just the idea of it. The lesson I learned, was not to leave anything around the room that you don't want taken. Overall, I loved the vibe and the energy of this hotel. We are not young at 52 and 53, but enjoy a good time. I did not feel that the room was too loud (and noise usually bothers me when I sleep). The decor is beautiful and they will have a great product, when they get it all together. INC magazine was there when we were and it would have been a great opportunity for the hotel to be at it's best. But, the INC people we spoke with (who were spending their money at the hotel) could not help but compare the Cosmo to other hotels. I will give the Cosmo another try. I think that in a few months, they will get their act together. There are so many positives, I want them to succeed!", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cWONDERFUL WRAP-AROUND SUITE!\u201d", "Author": "Check9", "ReviewID": "UR103817606", "Content": "My daughter and I spent two days at the Cosmo starting on Monday April 4th to the 6th. We were in line at 2:00 and probably waited less than 15 minutes and received a room right away. We were lucky enough to stay in a wrap-around suite on the 65th floor facing the fountains of Bellagio. It was wonderful. The room is huge. The view was unbelieveable although I felt it was a little too high for me but my daughter thought it was great. I didn't enjoy the balcony as much as I had anticipated. We had a friend staying on the 31st floor facing the fountains and I found that balcony a little easier to stand on and enjoy. You could not hear the music very well from the 65th floor but could hear it just fine on the 31st. Make sure you try and get a floor above 30 as otherwise you may have the Bellagio sign right in the way of the view of the fountains. I was concerned about noise while trying to sleep. The first night we could hear some music from a club, not sure where. I turned my noise machine on and used ear plugs and that did the trick, didn't hear anymore. With the doors closed to the balcony you could not hear the fountain from the 65th floor. We loved the room decor and especially enjoyed the washer and dryer and used it many times. Having two bathrooms was great and the showers in both are huge. We've stayed at Encore and most of the five star hotels on the strip and it is giving Encore some good competition. We had a $50.00 food credit so used it for the breakfast buffet at The Wicked Spoon and it was the best we've ever had and we've done the Wynn and Bellagio. They have red velvet pancakes with a special cream-cheese topping which was really good. They had other items we had never tried before and everything was super. The rest of the credit we used for coffee in the hotel and a few treats from the frig in our room. We ate at Holstein's and it was terrific. Had the mac and cheese with lobster and a malt. Just wonderful! We had the pizza everyone has mentioned and it was very good too. Hard to find, we had to ask someone. The casino is beautiful and we had fun just strolling around looking at everything. The chandelier bar that everyone has mentioned is really something to see. Lots of younger people there, all dressed well. But, you find a few older ones too, also dressed very nice. All in all I think it does probably cater to the younger crowd. Didn't have any luck on the slots but had fun trying. One more thing to mention is the parking lot. It has the best parking garage in Vegas. You enter on Harmon Street and you have to see it to believe it. You can see down every row exactly where there is a spot open. There is a light bulb over head of each parking space, red lights for full spaces and green for an empty space, plus they show how many spaces are available for each floor as you enter the floor. The only bad part was there are a couple floors for Jockey Hotel parking only. Seems weird but a couple times we had to go down quite a few floors to park because of that. We stayed at Aria last year shortly after it opened. We walked over there to play and it was very quiet.

I called the front desk to complain and Ryan informed me that (a) they try to accommodate all guest (except I guess any of us not at the party and are paying for a place to sleep) and (b) He indicated they have a permit to play music until 4am. Which is a subtext to say the hotel has no regard for the guests over the people in the club. And that's just the salt on the wound. After 7 hours of travel I arrived at 10:30PM and was informed my room wasn't ready yet. 10:30PM, really? They appear to subscribe to the taking of the reservation, but not keeping the reservation. So they gave me a $100 credit to go eat somewhere. I wasn't hungry and I was tired, it 1:30am my time back home. I inquired when my room might be available and was told \"when house cleaning releases the rooms\", but they had no clue when that would be. I indicated to the front desk this was shaping up to be not a good Trip Advisor review. Surprising within a minute a room suddenly was available. But alas it was not the room type I requested and paid extra for. The front desk didn't tell me I wasn't getting the room type I reserved. So when I got to the room and found this out I called down to the front desk and they said they would \"try\" to find the room I reserved 3 months ago.

I had to call down and have engineering re-boot the TVs. And even then they are on an IP based TV system and the image is deinterlaced and averages about 15 frames per second, not 30 frames of any normal TV. The engineer sent to reboot the TVs indicated the IPTV provider had a lot of problems.

The staff at this hotel went out of their way to make my experience a great one! I will definitely be back! This hotel is great if you are younger (or older) and appreciate new technology. (I am Platinum Elite with Marriott if that matters to you--I like to look for reviews from other Marriott elite members, as they tend to look for the same things in a Marriott hotel as I do.) Check In: There was a line at check in, which had me a bit concerned. However, the line moved quickly, and my room was ready right away. The front desk recognized my Marriott status and recommended getting a basket of fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies that was delicious. They also made sure that I had a very nice room, and they helped me navigate the various offerings at the hotel. I also got a rollaway bed, which was very helpful. (Short rant: During check in, there was someone at the desk next to me trying to negotiate an upgrade and getting all worked up about not getting a jacuzzi room. If you don't bring significant business to Marriott or to the Cosmopolitan, why should you expect the best room in the place? These people need to either put in their 75 nights/year with Marriott or be a high roller with Cosmo or pay up! End rant.) Room: My room had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains. Everything was very clean, and you can pretty much control everything through your TV. If you are technologically challenged, there are manual light/temperature controls as well. I liked that I was able to play Sirius/XM music through my TV. Bath products were 3.4 ounce bottles, which is unheard of at most hotels. Also includes a dental kit, mouthwash, and lip balm The only downside to the bath products is that they aren't really safety sealed (just a little tape strip). Shower and soaking tub were huge. Slippers and robes are standard. I read some reviews that the rooms are loud. I'm not quite sure what someone staying right in the heart of the strip expects on a weekend night, but it will probably be a bit noisy! If you need silence/tranquility, the JW Marriott would be a better option for you (much older crowd at the JW Marriott). However, I had no problems sleeping late on a Friday night. Food: The Wicked Spoon buffet was great, and I typically dislike buffets. If you are Platinum Elite you get two free buffets/day. The hidden pizza place (3rd floor) is delicious--try the sausage/pepperoni/meatball pizza! Soda is $3+, so get your drinks in the casino if you want to save money. Holsteins looked great, but I didn't get to eat there. Pools: The pools are very nice. In addition to tanning with beautiful people, the pool I went to had a game area outside, along with a wall of TVs showing various sporting events. I felt like i was in heaven. There are multiple pools, including one at the Marquee Dayclub. Club: Marquee is an awesome club. Being a hotel guest will help you to get in. Note that your hotel room only allows you to admit two people total...unless you have a room full of beautiful women, in which case you will probably all get in free. Everyone at the club was really friendly and created a safe, fun atmosphere to dance and have a good time. The bouncers really got people excited to be there! Other: Note: The crowd at the Cosmopolitan is young and well-dressed. I've never seen so many women (and men) dressed up in the middle of the week for no reason. The casino was fun. The game I played has the best odds in the casino, but people were so into the usual games that I pretty much had the table to myself. Worked for me! I watched a guy win $15,000 playing craps--that was fun to watch. I would stay away from the slots--there's a reason they were empty while I was there. Wireless internet is free. Valet parking is free. To get to the hotel, turn from Las Vegas Blvd. onto Harmon. This isn't very well-marked, so make sure to turn here to avoid having to u-turn.

Check in is ultra cool with ipads mounted to the front desk and giant ipad directories on various walls throughout the property. The room was the best we've ever had in Vegas-it was huge! The bonus of having a terrace was great for both fresh air and additional space. We appreciated the mini kitchen, not to meniton the living area and multiple desks. The actual sq footage is probably similar the Encore, but we preferred the layout of the room much better at The Cosmo. Bathroom was nice and roomy and I loved the deep tub! It was nice to have an additional full length mirror outside of the bathroom when getting ready (women traveling together will love this!) and the 2 flat screen tvs were a plus. I vistied the spa twice for different massages and both times my treatments were excellent.

I booked the Terrace Suite ($345/night), and was charged in advance. My first concerns were the fact that the hotel could not send me a receipt for the advance charges. It took 4 or 5 calls, and three weeks, before I found an agent who agreed to type up a receipt and send it via e-mail through her private account. Bravo to her, but what accounting system are they using there (SAP?). So I checked in Friday night. No room for me (at least not the room I reserved). Sounded like a Seinfeld episode (why take a reservation if you can't hold it?). They had the smallest room available. When I complained that I was not going to pay $345/night for a closet, the attendant agreed to lower the rate (what service!). He was kind enough to give me a $100 credit. However, I'm still at the hotel, and I'm going to bet that somehow the credit is filed in the same system that my reservation was in. I've never actually been moved down in a room and had to ask for my rate to reflect that (but Vincent was apologetic and helpful). The room itself is nice by awkward in layout. If someone wants to watch the TV while I work at the desk, the TV is six inches from my head (one reason for wanting a room to work in). And I must say, the internet connection is actually terrible. I'm going to have to hike out of the hotel and find a Starbucks or something to try and make a VPN connection. I'd probably stay here again at one of the larger rooms, but not for the adverstised price. The hotel is very trendy. Very modern. And the staff were as helpful as could be. I was trying to think of an analogy and came up with this. Imagine a very nice place, with good people, but managed by Lockheed Martin (not exactly known for customer service). That might give you an idea. Don't be confused though, it is not a part of City Center, that's a different property. I'd suggest that the hotel scrap whatever accounting IT system they have, walk over to the Marriott, and see how a good hotel is run. That's probably a great training excersize for them. Breakfast at The Henry was excellent, but the staples/nails on the underside of the chair (holding the fabric liner in place) almost cut me hand when I tried to move the chair. They did bring me another chair, but I'm pretty sure somebody else will get sliced. Two more days to go--I'm waiting to see if they can multiply 5 times 179 and subtract 345. minus the 100 credit.

The check-in process wasn't nearly as bad as the other reviews say. We arrived around 10 am since we had such an early flight, but we were able to pre-register and leave our baggage with the bell desk so that we could go and get our marriage license and then eat some lunch and peruse the rest of the hotel. The desk stated that they would call us when our room was ready. I've heard normal check-in was at 3pm, but after lunch we decided to pay the front desk a visit and check the progress. Our room was clean, but had not been inspected but they gave us a choice to check-in right away, or wait for the inspection. We were tired from the flight and decided to take the chance. The room was perfect, very clean and still new. We were on the 35th floor of the East Tower and we had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains from our balcony. I can't say enought great things about the balcony. My wife and I are both smokers but we don't like to smoke indoors, even at home. A balcony is a must have for us and, in Vegas, they are almost non-existent. Everybody employee at the hotel was very nice and eager to please. We thought housekeeping was slightly unresponsive when it came to needing things replaced. For instance, my wife had come down with a cold toward the end of our stay and we needed more Kleenex. It took two calls and about 6 hours but they were finally delivered. I believe part of the problem is that everything is handled through the \"beck and call\" line. You talk to one person who will send your request to the appropriate staff. I wonder if either housekeeping is either understaffed, or just a bit lazy. The soaking tub was a small disappointment. I am 6 feet tall and had a hard time sitting in the tub. I expected it to be deeper. The water only came up to just under my chest. The minibar took up all of the space in the fridge. I've seen other reviews with same complaint. It would have been nice to keep our own soda cold and avoid the 4 dollar per can charge of the minibar soda. The casino was pretty unforgiving. We didn't expect to win money playing the slots, but we also wanted to make the money we knew we were going to lose last longer. We had much better luck across the street at Planet Hollywood. We didn't visit the stores. They were very high end and extremely pricey. We ate at The Henry, The Wicked Spoon, STK, the pizza shop, and Holsteins. Most of the restaurants in the Hotel are extremely expensive and most of them had menu items we were afraid to try (we are simple meat and potato people). Holsteins was a very good burger and hot dog place but I was disappointed that most of the hot dogs on their menu weren't even available. The Henry was the most practical restaurant in the hotel. STK was the most expensive meal we have ever eaten. However it was fantastic and it was the dinner we had for our wedding night (expensive dinners are easy to justify if it's on your wedding night). The pizza place was very good and open late. The Wicked Spoon was probably one of the best buffets I have ever had. All in all, we enjoyed our stay at the Cosmopolitan.

The Marquee club which is part of the hotel is truly an experience and adds to the Cosmopolitan as being the place to be in Vegas. I found everyone at the hotel from check in, to management and the waitresses in the bars absolutely first rate. I would hesitate to come here again and recommend it to friends.

Thanks to these reviews, we came as prepared as we could for the potential pitfalls. Turned out to be one of our best Vegas trips yet, and there have been quite a few! I've said it in prior reviews and it bears repeating, expectations need to be lowered a notch on the Vegas strip. Especially on weekends. Even the Bellagio, Wynn/Encore and Cosmo. They're all noisy 24 hours, check in lines can be outrageously long, infrastructure (e.g. water, IT systems etc.) are glitchy, and once you've made the 10 minute trip to your room just try to get someone to help you out way up there. Oh - and food is usually expensive for what you get. To avoid disappointment, preparation is key. With the background out of the way, here's a list of common comments about the Cosmopolitan, and what we did to deal with them. Use what you find helpful: - Location - is perfect, situated in easy walking distance from Bellagio, Planet Hollywood/Paris and City Center. If you have a car, leave it with the free valet. Cosmo's valet was the quickest we've ever seen on the Strip for retrieving cars. Less than 5 minutes, and you get to comfortably sit in air conditioned comfort while waiting. Careful in their driveway, though, because it's very tight and tricky to navigate. - Check in - We came armed with a copy of the confirmations they emailed to us, and a printout of their website page that shows the 3pm check in time. I was prepared to hold them to the 3pm deadline to have our room ready or move over to Planet Hollywood at 1/3 the rate. We needn't have worried, though. After waiting for the one person ahead of us in line (not even 5 minutes), we were swiftly checked into our (ready!) room by a very friendly and professional Front Desk gentleman. This was about noon on a Sunday. - Room cleanliness - thank goodness the room was thoroughly cleaned every day, because I don't know how one can prepare for a dirty room. - Noise - Yes, it is. I can't place all the fault for the noise on Cosmo's shoulders, as all our noise came from the Bellagio fountains and a nightclub across the street at Paris. The room's soundproofing seemed great, but it's hard to block out noise of that caliber. Earplugs took care of it and we slept like babies. They do like their music a little on the loud side in the common areas, especially late at night. I overheard other guests complaining to each other about it, but we thought it added to the atmosphere. - Amenities - We brought extra hangers to compensate for no drawer space. There was a shelving unit in our closet, though, that held socks, etc. just fine. To avoid mini bar charges, we just brought in our own coffee pods and pastries from the bakeries at Bellagio, Caesar's or Venetian. Cosmo's towels are the best I've seen yet on the strip. Housekeeping never did replenish some of our toiletries, so we hunted down a housekeeping cart and asked for several extras. - Restaurants - This place has by far the best selection of non-stratospherically priced restaurants of any strip hotel. We tried Scarpetta, the hidden pizza parlor (great, cheap eats!) and Comme Ca - all excellent. Also tried the Wicked Spoon Buffet and the Chandelier Bar, which were both good too, but I thought not such a good value. - Atmosphere - was a disappointment. I was expecting the artsy spaces of the Cosmo to attract stylish people. Wynn/Encore do. Bellagio does. What's up, Cosmo? It was noticeable. The contrast between the spaces and the people in them countered all the hard work done by the Cosmo's designer, and nixed our thought to spend an afternoon at the pool once we got a look at it. The creepy guy that kept peeking in our room around the barrier between our two balconies was really getting on my nerves. - Check out - line was horrendous, and we had previously given up on checking out using our room's TV which was an exasperating experience. Luckily there were automated check in/out kiosks by the bell desk that worked like a charm and even printed out a detailed receipt for us. Sweet. We loved our stay at the Cosmopolitan. The staff went the extra mile, the rooms are spectacular and the food was way above average. Would we stay again? Yes, if we could get a rate comparable to Wynn/Encore or Venetian.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAn excellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "JMcPartlandDoran", "ReviewID": "UR102158443", "Content": "Spent six nights for my partner's 40th in mid March and can honestly say that this is the best hotel I've stayed in.

It seems to be trying to carve a niche for itself by aiming at a more laid-back experience and that's what we appreciated especially since it came with the high standards you'd expect. We had a terrace studio overlooking the Bellagio & Paris which was great, the suite was spacious and well appointed, and from start to finish all our dealings with hotel personnel were both friendly and efficient.

It's in fact a bit \"much\" on first impressions even by Vegas standards. The terrace room we had, overlooking Caesars and the Bellagio fountains, was brand new, looked like it had never been used before. Nothing to fault except one of the 2 TVs wasn't working. It took a good hour for a technician to come and fix it. Housekeeping is so-so. During our brief 2-night stay they managed to forget replacing hand towels and washcloths, as well as left behind a used washcloth in the shower. Not good enough really. The towels were brand new, never washed, so bits of white fluff end up sticking to your body when you dry yourself. One of the 2 pools was inexplicably closed. Worst aspect was probably the room service breakfast served by an impossibly overbearing, intrusive, fake-friendly waiter who on morning 1 showed up late and on morning 2 showed up 10 mins early. He wouldn't stop talking, inquiring about my wellbeing, explaining the obvious: \"this is your cereal, this is an egg, this is a glass of juice\" etc. Please! Just serve the food and go! This sort of intrusive, in-your-face \"service\" is what makes America such a frustrating place to visit sometimes. They probably think it assures them of a good tip. Au contraire! Good service is practically invisible, it's quiet, it's unassuming and discreet. Americans probably love it if their server addresses them by their name 2 dozen times in 5 minutes. I don't. To cap it off, we were charged for the room service breakfasts despite them being included in our room price. It took a visit to the front desk at check-out to get the charges removed. Food options in the numerous restaurants downstairs seem varied but Holstein's is a good choice for quality/value relation unlike some of the more overpriced options on offer. The Chandelier bar serves a lovely Cosmo (of course) and not too expensive either. Smoking still allowed in the casino is a huge massive turn-off and precluded us using the casino.

Free toothbrush, mouthwash, and lip balm in the bathroom did not come in a sealed container so there was no way of knowing if they had been used by the previoius guest. No plastic laundry bags in the room. They have a cloth bag to have your laundry sent out but I had to get a plastic trash bag from the gift shop to put my dirty laundry in my suitcase. 2nd day here, they changed my room key on me without telling me so I have to make the long trek from the east tower to the front desk. When I got back to my room, the key still didn't work!! They gave me a $50 food and beverage credit for my troubles but I didn't use it since I already had free breakfast. Music in the restaurants was very loud. Wanted to try out the burger place but the music was just too loud. Their workers will probably end up with long term hearing loss after working here.

Upon arriving, we waited nearly 30 mins just to get our room.

None of their routers reached our room (I have the new MacBook Air so there is no Ethernet outlet); (4) the rooms are supposedly smoke free, but our room stunk of marijuana; (5) I called the Operator to discuss my internet connection and was on hold for about 10 mins before anyone answered my call.

I got in line, and waited, and waited, and waited... three different times somebody would come up and ignore me when I was first in line and help the person behind me. I finally had to raise my voice to one of the girls, because I was getting fed up with this.

Check-in proved tricky though as we'd requested adjoining rooms to share babysitting but were told they couldnt do this in the suite ctegory we were in and offered us rooms in a lower price category or 4 doors away - we said we couldnt do this and asked how much to upgrade into a categopry where this was possible. Eventually we were accomodated with no extra charge to a wraparound suite with a connecting room in the category we had purchased and this was nothing short of exceptional! If returning (quite likely) i think we would book this room in advance and it catered to our needs perfectly as it had a massive lounge / kitchen area where we could all hang about and made looking after the babies in the evenings perfect as they could sleep in the connecting rooms enabling us to feel pretty much 'at home' and their sleep undisturbed which it would have been Im sure if we were in the same room as them. Perfect! The view was of the Bellagio fountains which the babies loved as much as us and at night the view was phenomenal. Room service was great - we were told an hour and the food arrived in 20 mins. ''Beck and Call'' on the phone was great - whatever you needed they would sort out for you. We had a bit of trouble getting a 2nd cot sent to the room but it eventually arrived. The door lock on out door got stuck but we reported it and returned later that night to finsd it fixed. Had no problems with the remote control / television which crops up in a lot of reviews. The staff weren't always sure on the answers to questions but with such a huge hotel i didnt think this was a problem and they would always check and come back to us. We did request 2 high chairs for the babies but never heard back on this request - wasnt a problem. We had a knock at the door upon arrival and were given a happy anniversary card and chocolates which was nice - if not a bit weird as it wasnt our anniversary - it was my wifes birthday so maybe there was a mix-up lol! We had the 'hidden pizza restaurat' takeaway twice and really enjoyed this - about $4 a slice and late at night its perfect. We ate in 'The Henry' right by the casino and had a great meal in there too. We had takeaway from the Mexican/Chinese too which was also very good. Shops were really good - they had a place to buy wine which was handy too and $20 a bottle probably about right for a 5* hotel Basic bits and pieces - water / milk etc all availabvle on-site but obviously at 5* prices which is to be expected i suppose Casino was great and the cocktail waitresses were always around - some hotel casinos you seem to wait forever for a drink but not here - in fact many times we were turning down drinks as we already had 1 or 2 on the go - a crime when they're free!

They included a bedroom, separate living area (which had room for a full size cot/bed brought in), full beautiful master bath (huge soaking tub and separate shower), separate guest bathroom, washer and dryer, full kitchen (dishwasher included), and balcony. WARNING: Do not allow them to give you a room above the Marquee Club. It is an outdoor club that stays open until 4 or 5 AM. Our first night we were on the 18th floor (two floors above the pool and club) and we did not sleep...AT ALL. The corner room had glass doors all around. Even with earplugs, it sounded like the party was just out side the door...into the wee hours of the morning. It was beyond horrible. They should have insulated the rooms better to sound proof for bar noise and/or they should have warned us. It would have been fine for people who were out all night and came in to sleep at 5 AM.

They were missing towels and it took them forever to service their room.", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel but very poor service\u201d", "Author": "redrocklove", "ReviewID": "UR101323812", "Content": "I stayed there for one night with my daughter. We got a special rate of only $110 for a beautiful room with a balcony. I believe this rate was 1/2 price through Book It. However, the service was very poor. I got there early since that was when my flight arrived. I stood in a very long line only to be told when I got to the counter, I was at the check out desk. There were no signs to indicate that and the person who was supposed to be there telling people what line to stand in was not there. They did help me anyway but said no room was available. I understood I could not get a room because I was early. They said they would call my cell when the room was ready. I went to the coffee shop in the hotel for a cup of coffee, standing a long time waiting for someone to take my order. The staff just ignored me. I finally had to interrupt them and ask for my coffee. We left the hotel to go sight seeing and didn't get a call until about 3:30 - 4:00. That night we filled out our requests for breakfast and put them on the door handle as instructed. We planned to eat quickly in our room then leave for the next part of our trip, as we had a long day ahead of us. I couldn't sleep all night because the hotel had music playing in speakers along the outside walkways, which were below our room. In the morning no breakfast showed up. When I called room service to ask where it was, they had no record of our orders. I asked where I could grab something quick, they said there was a coffee shop in the hotel. I sprinted to it only to discover the only food they had was extremely large pastries and cookies. Since I don't consider consuming a pound of sugar breakfast, we had to go without . Also I stood there looking in the case and everyone working there just ignored me again! I ran back to my room to try to check out on the fancy flat screen hotel that had controls on it for everything in the room and supposedly a check out selection. It didn't work. I got our things and found a very long check out line that wasn't moving. After waiting a long time, I checked with a hotel staff member to make sure I was in the right line and told her I was in a hurry. She told me about their check out machine, so I was able to use that instead.", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Red Deer, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel but a little disorganized\u201d", "Author": "abnewf", "ReviewID": "UR101297890", "Content": "Positives: Location: Centrally located on the strip the hotel is perfect if you are going to other resorts for shows etc. as you can walk to either end of the strip within 30 minutes. Hotel appearance: Amazing!! The changing screens in the lobby are only the beginning. You can spend hours walking throughout the hotel looking at all the very unique artwork adorning the walls, and in every crook and corner of the property. The Chandelier Bar is incredible! Room: We stayed in a Premium View One Bedroom with Terrace. We checked in early and opted for the south facing room rather than waiting 4 hours for the Bellagio fountain view, which our package stated. Being on the 63rd floor our view was spectacular! The room furnishings are beautiful, the bed and couch are comfortable, and there is lots of space for suitcases/clothes in the closets. The bathroom is amazing, with Japanese soaker tub overlooking the strip, double vanity, and large sized toiletries. Room Service/ Housekeeping: In our 5 day trip, we only opted to have our room cleaned once, but they did a thorough job and left new toiletries. We had room service once for dinner and once for brunch, both were great. The staff were friendly, the service quick (40 minutes) and the food delicious. Restaurants: We ate at Comme Ca, D.O.C.G., and the hidden pizza place. All three were great with D.O.C.G being our favorite. Fitness Centre: The fitness centre in the East Tower is very nice with the treadmills overlooking the Bellagio fountains. They have a good amount of equipment, and was never busy. The treadmills, bikes, and ellipticals all have built in tv/radio units which was neat. Negatives: Twice on our first day we got locked out of our room as the door key would not work, both times we had to walk all the way back to the lobby from the East Tower 63rd floor and through the casino as nobody was at the concierge desks by the elevator. We discovered on the second day that the hotel had put a $1500 hold on our credit card instead of $600 that it should have been. We went to the front desk once again, and I explained the inconvenience of this as visiting from Canada it is our best and sometimes only method of payment. They apologized and gave us $100 in food credit, which was great. Our package included a 4pm checkout, but once again we got locked out of our room that afternoon. The concierge that gave us yet another set of room keycards did not even offer an apology. At checkout our room charges were incorrect, but quickly reversed when I asked to speak to a manager about our issues during out stay. One thing that I read in other reviews and had to agree with was the noise level at night, you can hear quite clearly the music, etc. from the pool/bar area. This is to be expected in Vegas I suppose, however have never noticed it at other hotels. Just something to keep in mind if you have kids, or are a light sleeper. Overall I would stay there again as the hotel is beautiful, fun, and the rooms are amazing. I just hope they get some of their organization issues corrected soon as it adds unnecessary frustration to your vacation.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Knoxville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel in Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR101282399", "Content": "I have worked in the industry for 12 years and lived in Vegas for 4, and this hotel is the best.

Some mixed feelings, but overall the rooms are so superb (plus some unusual features for Vegas) and the design so interesting that I'll go with four stars. The lobby has lots of columns with digital images on them. It's definitely a distinctive feel compared to other Strip joints. Check-in did seem a little slow--thankfully there weren't many people ahead of me. I would not want to be here at a busy check-in time. When I got into the room (not until 4pm on a Wednesday, so don't plan on early check-in), it was literally stunning. It's really like a mini-condo more than a hotel room. All open with the living area at the door anchored by a huge curved sofa against the wall. The flat-screen is ginormous even by fancy hotel standards. There's a large closet and dressing area, then the bedroom beyond with a very comfortable bed and two cool circular bedside tables. Adjacent to that is... well, I hesitate to call it a bathroom. It's more a bathing area. You've got your sinks and WC, then through a glass door, a huge open shower area with opalescent tiles and beyond a step-up-and-in tub with a window overlooking the Strip. And where else in Vegas can you play with your rubber ducky and peruse the changing light on Paris and the Aladdin at the same time, I ask you? The tub is a terrific feature, though it's not a Jacuzzi and the levels of the two benches were not great for me. One too high (cold nipples), one too low (hard to hold a book out of the water). And getting in and out could be a production if you've had a cocktail or six. There's also a terrace with the same view and a rounded-back lounger. The terrace is generously-sized. NOTE: The room described is the Terrace Studio Suite. If you're gonna stay here, spring for a room with a terrace. There's just nothing else with outdoor space on the Strip for mere mortals except the Imperial Palace and well... Poked around the restaurant area (mostly on the third level) and had a late lunch at Comme Ca. Typical French bistro fare, well-prepared but nothing really distinctive. None of the restaurants really seemed to have a distinctive feel to me, but that was just from poking my head in. Most are open to the central area so you can survey them all. There is a distinctive bar set-up, with the chandelier that rises through several levels. It's hard to describe this feature except that it is beautiful and elegant and lends a continuity to the different levels of the hotel. Nearby, Julian Serrano at the Aria is still a fantastic spot to nibble your way through a tapas lunch--anything seafood I've ever had there is fantastic. The white sangria is heaven, and if you sit at the bar, the staff is a font of local inside scoop.

I travel to Vegas yearly for business and every couple of years for vacation. I travel weekly for business and stay in a variety of lodging establishments from moderate rated hotels to high end resorts. I feel I have a good basis for comparing hotel properties across the U.S. Even with my extensive travel schedule, this is the first review I have submitted on a hotel facility. The Cosmopolitan has very nicely appointed rooms and the decor of the entire facility is nice. Although, some of the surrounding properties are more glamorous. My reason for submitting is the lack of attention to detail throughout the facility as well as a poor layout. My frustrations began when we arrived at the hotel. We rented a vehicle for this trip as we planned on doing some sightseeing outside of Vegas. We pulled into the Eastside parking deck. There were no bellman to help with luggage so we loaded our luggage on a cart. Not a big deal. We took the elevator to the main floor expecting the hotel lobby to be close by. Wrong. We entered into the middle of the casino we no visible signs indicating the way to the registration desk. After touring the casino with our cart of luggage we finally see a sign pointing the way to the hotel lobby. We crossed through the entire casino to reach the hotel lobby. This was a big deal. I was displeased to say the least by the time we reached the registration desk. The check-in process went better mostly because there were only 8 groups checking in and 4 stations open. My observation at the registration desk was that there were no queue lines. People were free to walk up to a registration desk in front of people waiting for an open position. It was not a problem while we were there due to the few people checking in, but I could see it being a huge problem during a busy time. The gentleman that checked us in was very pleasant, maintained eye contact, and answered all questions. One of my very few compliments to the staff. As it turned out, our room was in the East tower, so we pushed our cart full of luggage back through the casino to the elevators. The layout would not have been too bad if we would have had a bellman. As in most hotels in Las Vegas you have to scan the room key to reach the lodging floors of the facility. The card reader in the hotels is not easily found on the elevator control panel. There were three groups on our elevator and all were frustrated before the slot was located. One reason we stayed at The Cosmopolitan was because they advertise having a kitchenette and they do. There is a microwave, a sink, a dishwasher, cabinets, but the refrigerator is crammed full of beverages. There is no room for any milk, juice, sodas, or anything else. I called to ask about having the beverages removed and was told that they would be glad to do so for $25. I was not happy. The $25 was not the issue. I was paying for 5 nights lodging and they want to charge me to remove items from the refrigerator that they advertise I will have use of. Something is wrong with that scenario. We had a king suite with a fold out couch. There was no linen for the fold-out. It took room service 2 1/2 hours to deliver. By the time they arrived we had given up and made do for the night. Those were my biggest complaints and they all happened the first night we arrived. My wife's complaints are that there was one very small trash can for the room, no drawers or shelves to place clothing, and that they charged $12 each time you use your room key to access the fitness areas. This bothered me as well since it was not disclosed until check-out. I do not usually get to worked up at hotels, but this facility is clearly lacking management with an understanding of customer service. Great facility, great location, clearly lacking in attention to detail and an understanidng of customer needs.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cTerrible experience\u201d", "Author": "Scout008", "ReviewID": "UR100923535", "Content": "My husband and I decided to try The Cosmopolitan but we had a terrible experience. We checked in before 3 so our room wasn't ready.

We were given directions to one of the three restaurants (out of 13!) that were open for lunch. However one of the restaurants wasn't open for lunch so we found one that they hadn't mentioned. At 3:30 we returned to the front desk. There was a long line waiting but, since we had already checked in, I went to the counter to find out whether our room was ready. I was told that I had to stand in line. After the 15 minute wait in line I was told that the room wasn't yet ready and that it could be anytime up to 6pm before we would get a call. At this point we were quite upset since we don't like standing in line and we couldn't wait until 6pm for our room because we had a business meeting we had to change for at 5:30. I waited another 30 minutes, stood in line again, only to be told that the room still wasn't ready. I started calling other hotels and we secured a reservation at the Four Seasons. As we were about to leave we received the call that our room was ready. And I had to stand in line again so it was another 10 minutes before we received our keys. The room was spacious and clean. However, there wasn't any water in the mini bar, only alcohol. I called to ask for water and was told it would be right up. It never arrived. At the end of the evening I called the \"beck and call\" line to ask for a 7am wake up call. I was assured that we would receive it. We never received the call.

I'm sure the Cosmo will be great for some people, but doubt I'll be back. The constant music just too much. Even on the 65th floor (East Tower, Bellagio view), I could hear night-club music in my room at night. Though not for me, I'm sure this place will be great for the young and hip who want the music, THE GOOD - Staff was universally wonderful.. friendly and helpful. Everyone from check-in to concierge, from the buffet staff to security all were fantastic. - Loved the design/theme of the room. At the artful touches made it feel not only special, but unique. - Balcony is to die for. Loved sitting on there (when there wasn't pulsating music drifting up from below) THE BAD - While the Spa was very nice, it lacked the \"wow\" of many other high-end Vegas properties. It was your basic spa, compatible to many mid / mid-high properties. Seemed odd, when everything else at the Cosmo seems to be \"turned up to 11.\" - Computer glitches. While I had no real problems, there is clearly something very wrong. My spa charges all had to be entered by hand, as the computers in the spa showed that somebody else was booked into my room. However, I shouldn't worry about it, as \"this kind of thing happens all the time\". Whaaaaat??? I did frequently check my bill, and everything was fine. THE UGLY - As mentioned, the music. I understand the loud music in the casino. I don't understand the loud music in the restaurants, especially \"find dining.\" But I can just avoid those if I want a quiet or romantic meal. What I can't avoid is the nightclub music drifting up into my room. I need my room to be a serene retreat at night, and it just wasn't. I'm guess I'm officially a cranky old man at 43.

This is the second year we've brought our wives and my wife and I started looking at places to stay back in December. We are both Marriott people and travel a lot for work, so the reward points rack up quick. We were super excited to see that Marriott had partnered with a new place on the strip and we decided to cash in points for the March trip. We started checking out reviews of the property and were a little nervous as we saw quite a few negative reviews mixed in with the positive. Well, let me set the record straight - we could not have asked for a better stay. First of all, THE SERVICE IS TOP NOTCH! Let me give you several examples: - They have employees and security walking throughout the property and it seemed like anytime we needed to be pointed in the right direction or had a question, there was someone there approaching us to help. - At dinner one night we struck up a conversation with a couple next to us and the lady happened to be the banquet director at the facility. I mentioned to her that I was trying to find a Port wine to enjoy with a cigar and was told the night before at one of the property bars that they didn't have any port. The banquet director said that wasn't good enough, picks up her cell phone, and calls the F&B director on the spot and asks him which hotel bars have a port. She lets me know where to go, hands me a card, and tells me to call her if I have any issues finding it. Now that is how take care of your customers! - When we were leaving for the airport at 4 AM (had an early flight) the night club was just letting out. There were literally, hundreds of people in the cab line waiting to catch a ride out of the hotel. One of the bellmen sees us with our bags, call us over and says \"hotel guests don't wait in line here\" and hails us a cab in front of the line. - My wife was checking out the mini bar in our room the first night and picked up a bottle of grey goose (didn't open it, just showed me how giant the bottle was for a mini bar). Well, we didn't realize that the fridge was sensored, so we got hit with a $50 charge to the room. We went downstairs to tell them what happened, and they took the charge off, no questions asked. A manager even walked over to tell us it was no big deal and made sure we were enjoying our stay thus far. - I know everyone was complaining about the check in time....we waited for 5 minutes and everything was perfect with our reservation. That's just the service side of things....the hotel itself is incredibly impressive! My wife and I both travel a ton for work and we haven't seen anything like this. It is hip without being cheesy. It is fancy without being pretentious. Every time we walked in to the place we had to comment on how cool it was. Our room was a Studio Terrace suite (east tower floor 37) and surprise, surprise, it was great. Tons of room, a balcony overlooking the bellagio fountain, beautiful decor and spacious bathroom. Housekeeping came everyday we were gone and did an excellent job. Our friends, who were staying elsewhere, came over for a drink in the room and were incredibly jealous :) ! The restaurants and bars we visited were all exceptional. We ate at Holsteins (low key burger, fries and shakes) and Blue Ribbon Sushi. Both had excellent food (service was a little shaky at Holsteins and fantastic at Blue Ribbon). The Chandelier bar will be the coolest place you've ever had a drink.

We did experience a few problems but nothing that would put me off. Check In: Seemed a little disorganised as several queues that weren't clear, they need specific queues for check in/out and should also prevent other ppl walking to desks directly missing the queue as we saw this a few times, but on other occasions the check in clerk told the customer to go to the queue. The main problem was that they couldnt find our reservation, thank god for iphones and wifi in the hotel as i got my confirmation out and they discovered it was booked for May instead of March from my reservation. Im not sure if this was the booking agent or the hotels fault, but the check in clerk sorted it eventually (took an hour), needless to say i'll be complaining to my booking agent (British airways). Room wasn't ready but we were there at 11am so didnt expect it to be and we got the room about 130pm. Room: Fab room, probably best i have stayed in Vegas and that includes suites at TI, GN and Mandalay. Best view ever overlooking fountains and eiffel tower from the 60th floor. Glad we had a terrace as it gave the room a different feel, my wife loved it altho i didnt venture too close to the edge coz of vertigo :) Service: Was good at all times, very friendly staff who seemed to love working at the Cosmo, room service messed up on breakfast 1 morning, forgot 1 OJ and milk for tea and took over 30 mins to bring it back up by which point we had finished. However the other time we had room service it was spot on. Casino: Very buzzy, very friendly dealers, lots of tables however i think they could do with a few more choices of slots. Bars: Bond was very good as was Chandelier, pricey but what you'd expect to pay these days. Pools: Great they have 3 pools, boulevard is place to be seen, sat round the pool a few times for drinks and was cool ppl watching. Bamboo pool looks nice and quiet but was a bit annoyed it was closed as it got a lot of sun, we were allowed on the pool deck but not in the pool and the bar was shut, no reason given as to why. Buffet: Very good, we were lucky to have breakfast included for the trip which we used, didnt try lunch or dinner STK: Good but not the best steak i've had in vegas, music was loud too so not great for a romantic meal, with friends it might be better. Was a little miffed they made us get a drink at the bar to wait for table yet it was ready in minutes and i couldnt transfer drinks to meal tab (obviously so i tip the barman) Va Bene: Got a great toasted italian sandwich from here, very nice indeed. Pizzeria: Slice was ok, not great but handy if you want to get a snack. Holsteins: Again nice burger, not the best i have had but was ok, beware the side of onion rings is huge. Overall, loved staying here, probably the room/view made it special but i like the vibe in the place too, and great to people watch.

I then called a day ahead the concierge to make sure to bring it on time i wanted it to be delivered, well guess what they brought the flowers too early and the ballons were late. I then complained to the concierge manager and gave us $100 dining credit. I would have prefer to have the floral and ballons on time than the $100 dining credit. The housekeeping was horrible, they for got to empty the trash in the living room, they left thier gloves in the bath tub wit trash in it, we put the towels on the floor so it can be change but the towels where not change we can tell because it was damp and had the same stains from my girl's make up, and they just hunged it back up sooo nasty. Same as the bed sheets and pillow cases wasn't changed. First time we checked in there was some trash on the garbage can we called the housekeeping and took them hours to clean it. The Cosmopolitan is beautiful, modern, and lots of art work. The room is also nice, the view and the shower is awesome. The wicked spoon buffet was very good. Overall, it was bad and i could have gone to a better 5 star hotel to celebrate our anniversary.

We stayed at Aria in November in a sky suite and this was our first visit to Cosmo. The check-in experience was not a good way to start our 3-night stay. Because of a previously bad check-in experience at Aria we were sure to be certain of the 3pm check-in time from the hotel's web site. We arrived at 1:30 and expected we might have to wait for a room. As expected, our room wasn't ready, and when we asked when we could expext the room to be ready, we were told that their check-in time was 3 to 6 o'clock and we may have to wait until 6. We told them that was inconsistent with their published policy, however, they still insisted they were correct and if we cancelled to go to another hotel, we would be charged for the first night because of their 72 hour cancellation policy. We showed them the published policy on their web site and told them they had until 3:30 to have a room available after which we would be going to another hotel and contesting the cancellation charge with our credit card company. When we went back to check-in at 3:30, housekeeping had just finished cleaning the room and we were checked-in. The one bedroom terrace premium view suite is spacious, comfortable and does have a spectacular view of the strip and Bellagio fountains. One of the negatives is that the hotel obviously didn't invest in soundproof glass because even with the terrace doors closed, you still hear the noise from the strip, the music and roar of the Bellagio fountains (from the 30th floor), construction noise during the day, etc. This can be overcome with a sleep sound machine which we luckily had. We did not encounter any problems with noise from within the hotel between the walls or from above, except for plumbing noted below. After several calls to \"Beck and Call\" to find out why we couldn't access movies on the TV, someone from tech support came up to determine that we were not properly checked-in (he didn't see our name displayed on the TV.) He called the front desk and within 30 seconds the problem was solved. The end to this less than perfect first day was a return to our room for the night to find that our room keys no longer worked. Rather than go back downstairs for the rather long walk from the east tower to the front desk located in the west tower, we used a cell phone to call the hotel (no house phones available in the hallway) and waited about 15 minutes for new keys to arrive. Another few other issues of note - for the first two days, housekeeping ran out of the supply of coffee for the room. So, the coffee maker was yet another aspect of the kitchenette that was pointless. There was no cabinetry with drawers in the room in which to unpack and we presume the two open shelves in the closet are supposed to serve that purpose, and the plumbing is rather noisy from above.

It was a 7 night stay and I expected it to be about that much. But nonetheless it was fun trying to explain this. I was on the 56th floor in the East Tower and had a great view of the strip and Planet Hollywood. The room was Large with a king bed. I also had a microwave. There is a mini fridge. But this is also the mini bar. I placed a 2L Coke in the bottom section. IMPORTANT: The bottom is a freezer. To my luck the housekeeping staff discovered this and remover the frozen bottle before it exploded. It was nice to know they had my back. The layout of the hotel is great for a conference. It's just a short walk from the East Tower to the conference areas. The West Tower is just an elevator ride to get to the conference areas. But I think the views are better in the East Tower. My room was maintained well by housekeeping. I was in and out of my room a lot but never did see them. They must be magic. The in room coffee is a bit discouraging. $5.00 from the mini bar. I did not open the package since others told me that the contents were not worth the effort. My wife was coming to join me later in the trip and she brought some coffee pods from home and they worked out well. The heat/air and lighting can all be controlled by the TV remote and bedside phone/radio. It was a bit confusing at first.

A word of caution if you have roommates that may want to mess with you things could get interesting. I'm sure we will see some YouTube clips to prove this. I loved the pool areas. I was only able to check them out at night. All this because I was shooting an event. I bet this will be the place to be this summer. I had a rental car and parking was real easy. You can self park for free. The parking area is quite easy to navigate with good signage. Be sure to park near the elevators for your tower. The red and green lights over the spaces to indicate an open spot the best I have ever seen. The Valet guys are great also. You can pick up at either tower location. The conference areas were great.

Had a very good experience and will stay here again the next time I go to Vegas. First off, the check in and service were top notch. These seem to be recurring problems with other reviews, but I had zero problems. I had 2 different reservation during my stay (I used miles for 2 of my stay) and didn't have any problems. I was checked in by Amanda and she was excellent. Got me lined up with a One Bedroom premium view overlooking the Bellagio Fountains. It was amazing! THE ROOM (5/5) was my favorite room I have ever stayed in. We were on the 26th floor in the East Tower. That includes the Encore, Venetian, and Four Seasons in Vegas. The room itself was clean and didn't have any tech issues. Had a small issue getting the blinds open which was corrected after I called the \"Beck and Call\" extension from my room. They came up within 20 minutes and had the issue resolved. The TV's worked great and there were no problems with the lights. I don't get why others complain about the lights being controlled through the TV. I always used the individual light switches and had no problems. Bathroom was beautiful and had a huge shower that connected to the soaking tub which had a large window with a view. Rooms had some neat art, wallpaper, and some interesting books. Lastly, the noise problem is also overstated. Yes, the Bellagio fountains are loud until midnight. We did not here any thumping bass from the nightclub and had no problems sleeping. Had zero problems with housekeeping and room service. THE CASINO (5/5) was the spot to be. If you like fun, this is where it's at in Vegas right now. At night (from about 11pm) the place feels more like a nightclub with the masses of people, music, and short dresses. I did not gamble at the tables, but I did place a bet at the Sports Book. The book just opened a week or so ago. THE FOOD (3/5) was good for the most part. I normally do not like buffett's, but the wicked spoon was delicious as long as you stay away from the chinese food part of the buffett. Everything else was great. Also ate at Holsteins and the secret Pizzeria which were both good. The only downside was going to STK. I like nightclubs and fun, but the music is way too loud here. I had to hunch across the table to talk to my wife. I think it gets louder throughout the night. By the time 9:30 came around, we couldn't wait to get out of there! The meat was also poor for a high end steakhouse. I got a filet and it was tough. Avoid this place. THE SPA & WORKOUT (5/5) facilities were outstading. My wife got a massage and said it was the best she has ever had. I used the workout facilities and they were nice and had a view overlooking the strip. I used the east tower facility, there is also one in the west tower with a boxing ring. THE POOL (4/5) was good. Disappointed that only one pool (the east tower) was open. It had a view of the strip and lost of chairs and cabanas. Good, but not on the level of somewhere like Mandalay Bay. NIGHTLIFE (5/5) was outstanding. Like I said before, this is THE PLACE TO BE. The place is very active with a ton of energy at night. Also got a table at the nightclub (Marquee) and it was nice. Had a cabana in the outside area and it made for a fun night. The next night, we snagged a table at the Chandalier Bar and watched all the characters around the casino and tried some funky drinks. SERVICE (5/5) was the best I have experienced in Vegas. Yes, even better than Encore. There is nothing wrong with Encore, but the staff at the Cosmopolitan seem genuinely happy to be there and genuinely concerned at making sure you have a good time. Maybe it is because we are a little younger (30's), but I feel like we were treated better here than other \"high end\" properties on the strip. Overall, I gave the Cosmopolitan 4 stars because not everything is going yet. Only one pool was open and I am not sold on the restaurants. I will stay here again.

I promptly went downstairs and cussed the front desk and invited the manager up to the room to explain WTF was premium about the view I had. He declined the invitation, but after fifteen minutes he got me a room on the East side with decent views of the Strip.

No kind of notification posted anywhere, just when you show up they tell you the pool is closed. Awesome. Glad I planned my day around being there at 3:00.

Its fair to point out that this hotel has been open for less than 3 months so there are certaintly some wrinkles that they need to iron out. Check in: I arrived at 12PM and stood in line for almost 35 minutes waiting to be checked in. This was the case for everyone standing in line. When I found out my room was not available, I was informed they would call me when ready. When the room was ready, I waited in line for another 35 minutes to get my room. I have not seen such a slow check-in process. When I checked out I was told a receipt would be emailed to me. That never happened and I had to contact the hotel a few days later to receive it. Rooms: I originally booked a Terrace Studio- Premium View. The room was obviously clean since it\u2019s so new. The view looked out over the Bellagio fountains. From about 9PM to Midnight, the music from the Bellagio fountain show felt like it was in my room up on the 28th floor. Sleep was not possible. I called downstairs to see if I could get another room but they were sold out but were able to accommodate me the next morning. I was informed that the music may have also been coming from the hotels night club. Do not stay in a Terrace Studio overlooking the Bellagio fountains if you anticipate going to sleep before midnight. The view is amazing but the sleep quality is horrible. I moved over to a King Suite facing the backside of the hotel on the 36th floor and liked this much better. However, at 4AM I awoke to loud music which was probably coming from the Marquee night club at the hotel. The King Suite has a door that closes in the bedroom which the King Studio does not. The shower in the King Suite is also much better. The beds are very comfortable. Wireless internet in the rooms is very reliable and fast. The TV sets have a governor on them. You cannot make them very loud. It\u2019s strange but it probably was designed so they didn\u2019t receive complaints about another guests TV too loud. The fridge in the room is stocked with mini-bar stuff and if you want to put your own drinks in, forget it. The only usable portion of the fridge is actually a freezer. Hotel Service- Besides the extremely slow check-in process, the hotel has very good service. There are concierge people everywhere guiding you around the hotel. Everywhere you turned it seemed that someone was there to help you. This included all aspects of the service including bellmen, valets and housekeeping. Casino- Obviously the casinos are new and modern and the dealers and pit-bosses were much more friendly and personal than many of the other Las Vegas hotels I have visited. The table minimum limits were slightly higher than some other casinos. I also found it very easy to get a drink. They do push hard to get you to join their casino program. I must have been asked if I wanted to join at every table I sat down at. My feelings are really mixed about the Cosmopolitan. They have spent ALOT of money building this place and the technology inside is overwhelming. The rooms are very high tech although I heard some ramblings from a few people that their TV's didn't work well as well as the phones I don't think I prefer the whole cosmopolitan feel of the hotel. I find everything to be too be overwhelming. Reminder: Before staying here, beware of the rooms that overlook the Bellagio fountains. They are LOUD.

I will def say the worse experience of the entire stay was the check in. The person who checked us in was the worse person to have as your first point of contact. He didn't even greet us and I should have walked away right then and there but I didn't. Since he just stared at us and stood there waiting I finally told him our last name and that we'd like to check in please. He clicked away on the computer, read some notes in the file, clicked some more, and just looked frustrated, when I inquired if there was a problem he shook his head and clicked some more screens, finally he printed off a paper for us to initial and sign (that is the first thing he said to us the entire time). I asked him if it was Terrace One Bedroom Premium View, he ignored us. I asked him if my info showed on my reservation that I had pre-signed up for their players card (Identity) and I wanted to make sure it linked to our reservations because unlike other properties, all your spending (including hotel and food charges go towards your tier level). ... he ignored me again. At this point I was annoyed so I asked again. He said no that's not the way it works and just asked me to initial and sign again. I did even tho I knew from preplanning he was full of it. ha ha. He writes our room number on a small envelope puts our keys in it and tells us to use the East elevators. That was it. By this point I'm like ok let's just get to the room and get a shower and go have some fun. We get to our room and everything was awesome until I see the view. It's the Bellagio parking lot! Yeah, not what I would call a Premium View, so I call their beck and call service and he was amazing. Found me a room w/ a great view of the Bellagio fountains and Paris' tower and even made the change in reservation so we didn't have to go back down thru the casino to the lobby. He even called a few minutes later to make sure we were able to get in and that we were happy with our view. Great customer service! Also, when I had him on the phone I asked him about the Identity card, and he said that he should have told us that we could get our cards and use them for our room keys and it would link all of our charges to the reservation for our points. We went down to the Identity counter and a very helpful and friendly staff member took care of getting us our cards and then with a quick stop back at the front desk (our boorish checkin person was no where to be found)... we got out accounts linked with our members card. I will say that with the exception of the front desk clerk at check in... everyone was beyond helpful and happy to answer questions or just check and make sure we were having a good time. We had to have security come and replace a battery in the safe for us to be able to use it, they were there in less then ten minutes and fixed it with apologies and didn't even take the tip we offered, refused it twice! does that sound like Vegas? LOL the buffet was amazing and I highly recommend it to everyone. we went right at opening for dinner 5pm on a Thurs and stood in line for less then ten minutes and were seated up close and taken care of by a very friendly server. The prime rib melted in your mouth and the desserts were awesome! I can't even do them justice trying to explain, and def try the gelatto. We also went to the buger shake joint, their food was amazing and I highly recommend it also. The food was quick, fresh and good. There was a slight problem with my burger (it came out rare when it was supposed to be medium) but they had it fixed in no time). I would also suggest their steak spring rolls as an app, very good and very different. all in all I would love to come back and stay, just a word of warning tho, make sure that you secure your front door (it'll tell you on the tv if it's open), the doors don't close all the way if you're not careful. I would also like to say that the drink servers in the casino couldn't have been more helpful and were quick to circle back around and make sure you weren't thirsty :) we had a few bumps (the safe, check in, the burger) but I will say they were taken care of prompt and quickly! very good service, you can tell that the majority of the people working at Cosmo were happy to be there and to make sure you were having a good time!", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cWorking out the kinks, but when they are done...the BEST on the strip!\u201d", "Author": "dvdmerwe", "ReviewID": "UR98900973", "Content": "Our first time to Las Vegas and we WILL be back and staying at the Cosmopolitan again!

My favorites are the Encore / Wynn Hotels and Bellagio and Four Seasons. I wanted to try the hip new Cosmopolitan due to the Center Strip location and suites offering a full kitchen and washer / dryer for my 14 night stay in February of this year. First of all this property has two towers. Request the tower closest to the strip for the best views - the East Tower. I spent two weeks in a Wraparound Suite category and they are amazing rooms. This property originally was marketed for sale as condos prior to the economic crash. So the Wraparound Suites are not hotel rooms at all - they are really very large and comfortable L shaped corner residential style condos with a full kitchen and washer / dryer which is perfect for a long stay in Vegas. Also they have huge balconies with excellent views. Request a view of the Bellagio fountains and a high floor. This is the best view I've experienced in Vegas. Amazing! Now the bad news - this hotel is really not ready to deliver 5 star service. Not even 4 star service. It was a disasterous stay in terms of service. Engineering was in my suite more than 15 times during a 14 night stay fixing smoke detectors, adjusting hot water valves in the shower, fixing the bath tub drain, repairing balcony doors that wouldn't properly close, repairing the airconditioning because the sensor thought the balcony door was open when it was closed (thus shutting off the entire a/c and heat in the room), repairing the dishwasher, fixing the stove top range because it was child locked, installing kitchen lights that were never properly installed, fixing the entry door plate because you couldn't deadbolt the room, etc etc ad infinitum. The condo had so many engineering defects that it became comical. Housekeeping was simply deplorable. Not even approaching 3 star levels of houskeeping. We complained to a houskeeping supervisor three times during our stay. The kitchen didn't even have a waste basket!! Can you imagine! Totally thoughtless and no advance planning on the behalf of management. Did they think people wouldn't use a full kitchen? These residential style wraparound suites are going to attract long stay guests such as myself and we are going to cook! The houskeeping staff were completely unprepared for guests who were actually using the full kitchen. Floors and countertops were left greasy and untouched. The kitchen usage is a huge issue for houskeeping and they are going to have to get their act together regarding guests who want to utilize the full kitchen. No plates, cutlery nor flatware nor cookware were provided. We had to call for a \"kitchen box\" to be delivered. This took three calls before anyone could figure it out. As well documented in previous reviews the internet / television issues were numerous. This hotel has huge IT problems which need to be ironed out. After all of this negativity let me say that this property has the POTENTIAL with proper management and staffing to become one of the top 5 star hotels in Vegas giving Wynn/Encore a run for their money in terms of service and facilities. Spa was amazing - try the Hamman Experience! Dining venues are numerous and world class. Casino is small and a non-event for me in any case. Pool areas are terrific - I can't wait for hot weather to try them! There are three distint pool areas all very well designed. They are going to have a hot pool scene at the Cosmo.

First, the room was phenomenal. We were on the 60th floor and it was not only one of the most well decorated and designed suites that I have ever stayed in, but the view over the strip at night is absolutely breath taking. My wife and I loved it and it was difficult to even get ourselves to leave the room because it was so nice. Maybe I had a good experience but the service was above average throughout my stay. As others have mentioned, the check-in area is a bit disorganized but I found everyone to be tremendously helpful. All of the restaurants were great that we tried but our favorite was China Poblano. I would recommend reservations if you are going to the more \"foo foo\" restaurants as space is fairly limited and the restaurants were full when we went. Overall the waiters/waitresses were pretty average in terms of the level of service but nothing that disappointed us. We also tried room service a couple of times and had no issues - everything came quickly and tasted good. The one area where the service was below average for me was in the casino. A lot of the time the dealers for the table games didn't understand the rules and paid out incorrectly. A LOT of the dealers were extremely chatty and that slowed down the gaming experience quite a bit. The cocktail waitresses were great - they all knew us by name and I could hardly finish one drink before another one would be in my hand. They were more than happy with $1 tips for drinks and were extremely friendly. Check out was a breeze. They emailed me a copy of my bill right on the spot which was nice since I hate getting paper bills anyways. I think this is a great hotel if you want to be in the heart of the strip, have a modern and sleek room and enjoy a tremendous view.

Clueless staff. Irritating stay.\u201d", "Author": "tdogg5184", "ReviewID": "UR98296581", "Content": "The good: The entire property is gorgeous, the casino, the bars, the reasturants and especially the rooms with their balconys. The views facing north and east from the rooms are simply amazing. The location is prime, right on the middle of the strip with none of the standard 1/4 mil hike from the casino to the strip that all other properties seem to have. We ate at a few of the reasturants and checked out the nightclub all of which were awesome. The bad: Check in to the hotel was the slowest I have ever had at a Las Vegas hotel, I come to town every couple months and have stayed at most of the higher end hotels on the strip and it has never been that bad. It took us roughly 25 minutes to be helped by someone, when we did get up there it seemed like nobody knew what they were doing and it took over 10 minutes to get me checked into my room. I asked on numerous occasions if there were any paid upgrades available and was ignored and just given my room. The front desk staff was nice but very unprofesional. I had to visit the front desk on two other occasions during my stay, once to retrieve a gift card a family member purchased for me and inquire about a resort credit i was supposed to get. Basically they said it was my travel agent's fault and there its my problem to take up with them. I would have expected for a 1k hotel stay along with 500 in incidentals they would give me the resort credit out of good will. My third trip was to close out my folio as I had to apply the giftcard and ensure no more bad mini bar charges were on the bill. I purposely went the night before check out to avoid the morning craziness and still waited over 20 minutes and it took roughly 10 minutes. While in the casino I always saw a line at the check in desk with just a couple of employees standing around. When we originally arrived to our room we noticed the door was slightly ajar and could be pushed open, we realized the door did not close tightly and had to be shoved close. I asked an employee in the hall and he stated thats how they all were and left it at that and walked away. We had issues with our door the entire stay, each time after our room was cleaned we only had to push the door to open it as housekeeping didnt close it properly. This made us very uncomfortable. It also took nearly 45 minutes to have our luggage brought up. The room was advertised to have a kitchenette with a refrigerator. There was a mini bar, some empty cabinets and a microwave. Not a kitchenette, a kitchenette should include some dishes and a refrigerator. Furthermore the bottom of the mini bar was the only open area to place items, I soon discovered that it was a freezer after everything I had put in there was ruined. Least they could do is put a warning on it. Its obvious this was originally planned to be a condo as there are several things in the rooms that just dont make sense. The tray on the bar was missing items which I later found out I was charged for when I was browsing my charges on the TV, I called and they said they would remove the charges from my folio. After I called I was no longer able to view my room charges on my TV, I just received an error. The phone and the TV worked intermittently throughout our stay, I actually had to call the front desk from my cell phone to order room service. All in all, the issues I experienced with the hotel were unacceptable for a property aiming to be 5 star. To be honest I don't see myself giving the Cosmopolitan another chance, I will be heading back to Wynn. Its just not worth it to have to deal with inconveniences like this while on vacation. It almost seemed like I cared about things more than the staff, I tipped nearly everyone I encountered and it didnt see to matter.

The cleaning crew did a great job with the room, the baby crib was AWESOME (full sized with bumpers and they delivered baby bath items with it which was a nice touch), the maintenance crew responded to our needs quickly (sub zero fridge broke but was fixed about an hour after I placed the call). We ate at several of the restaurants and enjoyed them all. The view and balcony were amazing. Some reviewers said the hotel was loud but we did not experience any unwelcome noise (25th floor). They are in startup mode and still have some flaws (long waits on the phone and front desk had long lines during peak check in hours, but I never had to wait as I avoided those times) but I think they will have them resolved quickly. The location of the hotel is PERFECT. I\u2019ll definitely return.", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cbeautiful room\u201d", "Author": "theberardis", "ReviewID": "UR97730137", "Content": "I very much enjoyed my stay at the Cosmopolitan in terms of the room and the service.

Having read some reviews with negative experiences of the service, I will admit that I was a little concerned about what we could expect. However, I can honestly say that almost everything was first class. I'll get the negatives out of the way first: Firstly, the wi-fi in the rooms is bad - it works late at night and early in the morning, but other than that it was impossible to connect to. Secondly, we paid extra to get the Terrace One Bedroom with Premium View and would hardly call our view premium at all - we were overlooking the side of the Aria and the monorail going through the City Centre shopping centre. Having read of these rooms having views of the Bellagio fountains etc, I have a feeling that we may well have been put in one of the non-premium rooms. Finally the pillows supplied, while large and numerous, were incredibly soft and offered no neck support at all. The hotel offers a 'Pillow Butler' service with extra types of pillows, but you have to pay for them, which I felt was quite poor But on to the good stuff. In short, the hotel is absolutely amazing. It's beautifully designed, spacious and just that little bit different, in a good way, that makes it stand out. We had no problems with check-in at all (although we didn't arrive until around 7.30pm) and once we arrived at the hotel we were on our way to our room within five minutes, and found the check-in staff friendly and helpful. In fact, that was a theme through everyone we spoke to there, everyone was polite and would do whatever they can to help - sure, there were some minor issues where occaisionally some staff didn't know how to answer a basic question and would refer you to someone else, but it was a brand new hotel and these problems will be ironed out through experience. Our room was superb - as mentioned, we took the One Bedroom Terrace option and it was absolutely perfect for a couple. The bedroom featured a large and comfortable bed (apart from the previously mentioned pillows) and opened out on to the terrace, while elsewhere there was plenty of space for clothes and a great sized seating area if needed. But the absolute highlight was the amazing bathroom with walk-in shower and Japanese soaking tub - both of which can be seen into from the bedroom if you do so desire. Food wise The Cosmopolitan was also excellent. On our first morning we had a room service breakfast as we were leaving for a trip very early and din't have time for the buffet breakfast, and the food was excellent and beautifully presented. It was also very reasonably priced. We also had an evening meal at the tapas restaurant, Jaleo. The food and service here was also excellent, with some knowledgable staff, and they served the best gin and tonic I've ever had. We also had breakfast twice at the Wicked Spoon buffet as we were given complimentary breakfasts for our stay - this was a seriously impressive buffet, serving almost anything you could ever expect to see at a brunch! One of the centre pieces of the hotel is the chandelier bar - a three storey bar built inside a chandalier. It really has to be seen to be believed, and was just one of many things things that would make us stop and say \"wow!\" - you could easily spend a few hours walking round the place finding new things. Some other stand outs were the giant shoes dotted around the place, and the art vending machines - retired cigarette machines that have been renovated to vend little pieces of modern art. Finally, the casino and surrounding bars were well spaced, modern (as you would expect) and, again, filled with friendly staff - and the drinks were strong! I didn't win anything in the casino, but I'm not sure I can blame that on the hotel... We thouroughly enjoyed our stay, the hotel is full of the 'wow' factor, and would highly recommend it to anyone looking to stay there", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cThey really need to get their act together.\u201d", "Author": "Jackeemd", "ReviewID": "UR97582131", "Content": "I stayed here during Valentine's Day weekend for business and pleasure.

I told them it was impossible because it's locked, we called housekeeping and she explained that they would have to come down and unlock it for you.

After reading the reviews about poor service and long check-in waits, we arrived prepared to gruel through the idiosyncrasies of staying at a popular new hotel. When we arrived, the check-in line was fairly long, however it went very fast. We probably did not wait more than five minutes. Our front desk host, Nick, apologized for the wait and proceeded to swiftly and professionally check us in to our room. Although we arrived prior to the 3PM check-in time, we were able to immediately access our room. Our Terrace Studio room was breathtaking and impressive down to the smallest attention to detail that you don't normally see in the nicest hotels (i.e., new toothbrush, pencil holder on the desk filled with perfectly sharpened color pencils, unique and interesting books, etc.). We enjoyed being able to open the slider to our outdoor balcony overlooking the Bellagio water show, and although we were concerned that the noise might be annoying, the slider, when closed, completely sealed the room. Saving the best for last, words cannot express how impressed we were with the design and function of the bathroom! The bathroom was literally a \"wet room\" with glass walls on three sides. One faced the balcony with a view of the Bellagio fountain from the Japanese soaking tub, one faced the bedroom but had drapes for the modest guest, and the last wall was the glass entry into the \"wet room.\" Because it was winter, the pool in our (East) building was closed, however the pool in the West building was open. Both are hip, modern, well designed areas with creative touches such as gigantic shower heads that spout out water to cool overheated guests or kids that just want to have fun. The hotel is located in one of the BEST locations on the strip, sandwiched between the Bellagio and the new City Center. It is connected to City Center via walking bridges so it is easy to visit the Aria, Vdara, and Mandarin Oriental hotels.

Check in was smooth, the desk attendant was friendly and efficient. He gave a detailed overview of the hotel and amenities, definitely a plus.

I was promised a call, which I got, at 2:00 p.m. Our room was ready. My son's was not. No problem. But when I called much later to check on his room, the woman on the phone literally argued with me telling me that he had already checked into his room. He had not. He was with us waiting for the call that we never received. She finally realized that she had made a mistake when she looked at her computer and I got an apology. I'm not talking slightly rude here. She was obnoxiously rude. The only other problem that we had was when a hotel employee used a key to walk into our room (without knocking) our first night to see if we wanted turn-down service. She almost walked in on us changing clothes. The hotel is amazing. We didn't come close to seeing everything in the 3 days we were there.

We checked in only to be told that the room we reserved was no longer available to us anymore and instead we got downgraded to a WORSE room that did not have a kitchen but were still being charged for the better room that did have one. Hmmm. We get to our room, insert the keycard, turn the knob and *THUD!* The door has been dead-bolted. The woman behind the door and I exchange stunned glances. She opens the door and reveals that she was inspecting the room to ensure that it was cleaned to the correct standards, in this case, she felt that it was not up to par. There were cigarette butts and ashes all over the balcony. Glasses with last night's unfinished whiskey on the sink. The microwave wasn't clean. There were items in the safe. And according to her, the toilet was not cleaned enough. Yuck. She asked if she could return with a cleaning staff member and that she would supervise them to make sure the room is cleaned properly. Since we had a dinner reservation that was coming up soon so we said \"sure.\" Dinner ends. It's midnight now and we're tired from day's work, the flight and the night's festivities. We're walking back and looking forward to showering and relaxing in what is (despite it's uncleanliness) still a luxurious room. However, we return to our room to find a dirty broom left leaning on the sink counter and that we have no toiletries what-so-ever. I call and ask for toiletries and to tell them they forgot their broom, lady says she'll send someone up right away. \"Right away\" turns into an hour and still no sign of toiletries. My girlfriend calls to ask again and 10 minutes later, I open the door to an angry man who says nothing, storms into the bathroom, drops off a handful of toiletries and on the way out, he asks in an irritated tone \"is there's anything else you need?\" my girlfriend comes out and tells him he forgot his broom. Since we were only staying for one night, we requested a later check-out time when we were checking in. They allowed us to check out at 2PM instead of the standard 11AM. Great. Around 12PM the next day, the phone rings and the most rude woman tells me what time standard check-out is and has the nerve to condescendingly ask me if I know what time it currently is. Whatever happened to manners? I know most people don't have them but this is the field of hospitality...anyway, I tell her about our late check-out and she doesn't apologize, just says she'll enter it in the system (why didn't the check-in guy do this?). It's a shame because the hotel really is nice and we were really looking forward to staying here. This was a Wednesday night, the hotel wasn't even busy and there weren't even that many people there. There was no excuse for the terrible service and rude staff who couldn't even do basic things. I'd hate to wonder how our experience would have been if it had been on the weekend. Perhaps it's because the hotel's still new or we just came on a bad night, who knows, but we've stayed at other hotels on the strip and never had any issues like the ones at The Cosmopolitan.

Arrived at the hotel at 11:00am and walked up to the desk. Checkin took about 10 minutes. We had a 1 bedroom Terrace with Premium View. We were given room 6095 on the East Tower. All I can say about the view was amazing. We were directly infront of the Bellagio Fountains and had a great view of the Strip. Our room was very spacious and exceptionaaly clean. We asked for additional hangers and they were brought to us in about 5 minutes. We also informed the front desk that we needed to use the fridge to store some medication and they said no problem. We did this so that there would be no issues to reverse the charges on the mini-bar. The coffee maker uses a pod system. The hotel charges $5.00 for the coffee in the room but if you go to Walmart before you leave you can buy a bag of Senseo Pods for ablut $5.00 and that gets you 18 coffee's. They are the correct ones to use. The pizzeria hidden on the 3rd was wonderful and the price was not that bad. We know someone that ate at Scarpetta and they said the portions were very small and extremely expensive. We tried the buffet on saturday night no bad but it could have been a little better. Not up to par with Bellagio or Wynn. The staff was extremely kind and were very approachable. The casino got very smokey on Friday and Saturday night. The Chandelier Bar again is something that has to be seen. It cost $8 mill for the cRystals and another 18 million for the rest of the 3 storey bar. Parking was very easy but beware to park closer to your tower elevators. Also the Valet is free they just work on tips. Our room was cleaned every morning with no issues and if we used the soap or shampoo they replenished it right away.

BUT...the technology is miserable\u201d", "Author": "Wally3433", "ReviewID": "UR96606060", "Content": "Just spent the weekend at the Cosmo. I booked a Friday and Saturday night stay back in November for $325 per night, with a $260 dining credit. So, on a net basis, our room was $200 per night. The room category we booked was \"Premium View Terrace Studio.\" however, when we checked in the hotel at like 10 pm they said that our room category was sold out. After some foot stomping, they put us in a \"Premium View One Bedroom Terrace\" AND added another $100 credit to our bill, which brought our total down to $150 per night. The staff was friendly at check in, but very SLOW because thier systems are just too cumbersome. It took us about 40 minutes to check in. It also seemed like everyone else that was checking in was working on room situations. There was no way that the hotel was booked for the weekend, so I can't comment on what the issue was. Our room had a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains and the strip - we loved the view from the nice big outdoor terrace. The rooms are definitely quirky, with lots of headscratchers, but overall the quality of the building materials and furniture was outstanding. Some examples of things that left your head scratching: The kitchenette has a dishwasher but no utensils, plates, etc? There is no fridge, except the minibar, which you can't touch (unless you want to pay an extra $25 to have them remove all the items). There is space down below in the fridge that we used for beer, but they exploded because we found out that this was the freezer section. The TV's are awesome, but they have a \"governor\" on the volume - you can only turn them up halfway. If you have the balcony door open or if someone is taking a shower, you can't hear the TV. There was no dresser or anywhere to put clothes into a drawer. The bathroom lights were not bright enough. All small things that are really no big deal.... Many people have commented on the TV/phone system. I agree that it sucks. It's just way too slow, and sometimes the TV or phone will flat out stop working. It's like the software is too much for the hardware. The Dish Network guide couldn't even pull up the name of shows that were on the TV most of the time. We did not let it bother us, but this is clearly an issue for the hotel that needs to be addressed. Alot of people are saying that the TV runs the lights - and while this is true, all of our lights also had switches on them as well, so I'm not sure what they were experiencing. We loved the lobby, casino, mall area and restaurants. We went to one of the pools as well and it was awesome - there was a huge outdoor spa that was set at 103 - very nice. Wife loved her spa treatments - everything in the spa was first class. They do not take Spa Finder gift certificates, which was a bummer. There's a ton of really neat art on display throughout the hotel - some of which is on digital displays and is everchanging - very nice addition. Everytime you go into the lobby - it seems like you are in a different hotel because they change the art themes that are being displayed around you. The casino table limits were high, but that's expected when a new hotel opens on the strip. They will even out over time. We asked the pit boss regularly if we could bet $10 a hand at blackjack, etc. and they obliged each time - which was very nice. The casino is kind of a meandering stream, wrapping itself around clubs and restaurants and bars - a very tasteful layout. The other thing that's nice - they always have cool music playing, and they turn the slots way down - you can't even hear the slot machines - which was a refreshing change of pace. Lastly, a comment on location. This hotel is ON the strip - I can't imagine a hotel with better access to the strip. You can see the strip from the casino. You can cross the street at each side of the hotel - so basically you are a 5 - 10 minute walk to every surrounding hotel. Overall - we were very happy with our deal and the hotel. Yes - it has some quirks, but they were not enough to bother us.

Once I called the front desk and they put me in touch with security, the security representative explained that it happens frequently and told me how to push the door toward the hallway in order to release the deadbolt. It seems to me that if it happens so frequently (which I confirmed with another guest who experienced the same problem) the hotel needs to post instructions on the door so you could get out in an emergency. Also, my telephone did not work (apparently that also happens frequently and you need to reboot the phone, as I was told by the front desk). Again, another significant issue if there was any kind of emergency. My room was boiling hot and the temperature control on the television didn't seem do have any affect, so I woke up sweating several times during the night. Housekeeping also needs to do a better job of inspecting the rooms as one of the lights was out in my bathroom and there was no toilet paper.

Really good location in the middle of the strip so if you want to be in the middle of things then can't fault this place at all! Another good point is that the Cosmo doesn't charge a resort fee which nearly all of the other hotels in Vegas do. Not sure if this is just a promotional incentive to get people in because the hotel is new or whether it is a permanent policy but considering when I stayed at the Aria it was something like $20 a day for the resort fee, it's a good thing in my opinion!

The Cosmopolitan exceeded all my expectations, so that's saying a lot. Our taxi driver urgently insisted we request an East Tower room, but upon check-in, it was full, so we were upgraded to a suite in the West Tower. I can't imagine what the East Tower has going for it that the West Tower does not: We had a superb view from the 22nd floor overlooking the Bellagio fountains and looking north toward the Strip. The room was gorgeous, with ultra-modern decor and luxe touches like shimmering glass tiles in the oversized bathroom. It's ideal for someone who likes the energy of Vegas but appreciates good design and thinks that the ostentatious \"old Vegas\" of gold leaf, brocade and theme casinos is the height of tacky. Service was phenomenal - hotel staff were stationed everywhere, it seemed, for directions, questions, whatever. Everyone was warm, friendly and eager to help. We did not meet a restaurant or bar we didn't like. The line for Marquee - apparently the hottest club in town - was too long, though, so we didn't go in. We started at the 3-story Chandelier Bar, which is over the top, but they're tongue-in-cheek about it, and the drinks were delicious and service was spot-on. I loved that one of the bartenders sported a blonde mohawk. We then checked out Bond and it was cool, but a bit loud for us old fogies on Friday night, due a live DJ. We opted for Vesper, where I had a wonderful hand-crafted cocktail. For dining, China Poblano served some of the best tacos I have ever eaten, and I review restaurants professionally (as in paid, not just a blogger). Jaleo was off the charts for tapas. A must-do. We also toured through the Wicked Spoon Buffet and I can't wait to go back to try it - and this is coming from someone who is solidly anti-buffet. They honestly had marrow bones. At a buffet. Sigh. It was a tad chilly last weekend so we lounged by the pool in our jeans and jackets, but want return when it's warm. It was by far the best pool area on the Strip - multi-level, 2 bars, great design. But it's the little things here that really made it for me: The jaw-droppingly beautiful and hip coffee table books. The giant high-heeled shoes in the hallway. The incredible-smelling shower gel. The unbelievably helpful bellmen and super-sweet room service staff. I used to never care where I stayed in Vegas because I was always out walking the Strip or checking out other hotels anyway and rarely in the room or the hotel where I stayed.

Room had both wired and wireless internet. I was sharing a room, and the wireless would fail if we both tried to connect, so one of us had to use the LAN. One day the internet down for about 10 minutes. The room doesn't have a landline phone, instead has an IP phone - so the IP phone was also out, and couldn't call to inform the front desk. Some channels (ABC, CBS) just never worked. Sometimes the TV wouldn't work at all. Room lighting is controlled on the TV, which is nice, but sometimes that menu option just wouldn't be there at all. I had an issue with the bathroom, the toilet only has a partial door made of glass. Not soundproof...could hear EVERYTHING the other person was doing. What were they thinking with that! The bed was comfortable but nothing special. The bedding itself isn't anything high-end Some housekeeping issues. The coffee machine had a leftover pod from the previous guest - gross (I just wanted hot water for tea, and it came out light brown coffee). I asked the housekeeper to just refresh the bathroom one day instead of the full service, and all she did was leave a pile of towels. Left the trash cans full, no actual cleaning in the bathroom. The hotel lobby & elevators have really cool changing art digital displays. I loved the Chandelier bar, it spans several floors and is apparently all real crystals...it's very sparkly, like being in a chandelier. The casino is smaller than the neighbor casinos, a rather narrow strip, and pretty crowded. The restaurant selection is very good. China Poblano is half mexican half chinese. Loved being able to get steamed pork buns and tacos at the same time! Jaleo was awesome tapas, with a fun selection of things I haven't seen before...sea urchin with pomegranite foam? It worked! Holsteins had great alcoholic milkshakes and very good burgers, although I had one with foie gras that was not worth it, dry, disappointing. Scarpetta is always booked, the concierge couldn't get me in, so that's probably the best if it's that hard to get into.

Two years ago, my wife and I stayed at the Encore a few weeks after it opened. Last year, we stayed at the Aria, a fee weeks after it opened. This year, we stayed at The Cosmopolitan for four nights from Thursday, January 20th through Monday, January 24th. Each year, the experience seems to get better and better. Don't get me wrong, I loved the quietness of the Encore, and the fantastic Corber Suite views and ammenities at Aria. The Cosmopolitan really took the technological vibe of the Aria and the colors and unique look and feel of the Encore and have created a one of a kind Las Vegas hotel. We stayed in the Wraparound Suite facing the Bellagio and the Strip which was just an absolutely amazing room in the East Tower. The Wraparound suite itself is 450 square feet, and the rest of the suite was well appointed and spacious. The layout and look and feel of the Cosmopolitan was it's greatest selling point. The Pool Deck is so unique. From the pink pong and pool tables to the cabanas with tv's overlooking the Strip, it will be the place to hang out when the weather is warmer. All of the restauarants are close together around the Chandelier bar which is really the focul point of the hotel. The Chandelier bar is really that good! The second floor is NON SMOKING which was an awesome decision by management. Great vibe, for sure. The restaurants were all really good. We ate at China Poblano, Holsteins, and STK. The servive was timely and the food was very good. The Self Parking The only bad points were: The Wifi service was down on Friday and Monday and these were the days that I needed to get work done!

First I booked the room in December and received an email confirming the wrong type of room. I emailed the hotel and received a reply telling me to call them to fix this.If I wanted to spend time calling I wouldn't have emailed so I left it and figured I would have it fixed at check in. To their credit the front desk was aware of my email and upgraded us to a suite. Suite was very nice with a private terrace with a view of pools and strip. Furniture was a bit too modern (read ugly as in bright orange odd shaped table paired with purple velvet couch) for me but it was ok. Bed looked and felt like it was older than the month the hotel had been opened. Suite had wet bar ,mini bar, microwave, dishwasher and coffee maker.No plates or utensils.Could not find any coffee for special maker. Asked bell man about coffee and after lifting up everything on the mini bar he said he was on it and would have room service bring it up. Said we wouldn't be charged for mini bar items he lifted up. (Still don't know if I was charged because a copy of bill was not emailed to me yet and forget the TV check out. ) 5 hours later no coffee was brought so I tried to call the front desk and was instead routed to their annoying service, Beck and Call. Called 4 times for coffee and never got it. Had to go to another casino across the street to buy coffee each day. Both TV s froze every 30 seconds. Called and again got beck and call and then finally a repair man came. He spent at least 20 minutes fixing ? TVs. He never mentioned that this was a hotel wide problem with no hope of being fixed. As soon as he left TVs froze again. Safe didn't work. Again had to call beck and call who then had to route us to security and we then had to wait for them to come and fix safe.All doors stick and bang in room and in others nearby . Very loud. Needed to get back in room while housekeeping was there. Not a problem getting in but while I was there cleaning woman coughed nonstop all over everything she was supposed to be cleaning without even attempting to cover her face. Ate at 2 restaurants there. The SCARPETTA which was absolutely horrible!!!! 40 % pretension 40% bad service and 20% cardboard textured food. The Henry was a little better but it appears the Cosmopolitan owns or controls all the restaurants. All waitstaff appears to be trained and dressed the same. Efficiency in service was obviously not focused on in their training. Pools save this place. Very modern decor but the pools are beautiful. Another big plus -they were heated and open in January, two things I have not found in the 10 or more other hotels I have stayed at in Vegas.Overall casino is nice, still new so not too smoke filled. Beck and Call has to be the worst aspect of this hotel. Very annoying. First, I don't want to have to call anyone. The hotel had been open maybe 33 days. Why are things broken or not there? Second, I don't need to waste my time talking to someone who is only going to route my call. Let me connect directly to who I need or give me an operator. I don't need the annoying beck and call spiel every time. Finally I don't appreciate calling for something 4 times after being told someone is bringing it to my room and having the person who is supposed to be at my \"beck and call\" get an attitude with me. If your idea of a vacation is to lounge by the pool this is the place for you.It is probably worth the other problems to get to the pools.Otherwise if you are going to Vegas to gamble, don't plan on eating in restaurants in your hotel and don't expect everything in your room to work you will like the Cosmopolitan.", "Date": "January 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palma de Mallorca, Spain", "Title": "\u201cState of the art\u201d", "Author": "spainweb", "ReviewID": "UR93986412", "Content": "Just stayed there.

Left our cell phone number and headed over to Bellagio to the buffet, half way through dinner I realised they wouldnt be able to contact us as our phone was on 'roaming' from Australia and they wouldnt realise to add +61 to our phone number. Anyway after enjoying dinner we headed back to the check in area and enquiried if our room was ready. Indeed it was, and we had been upgraded (without asking) from a Terrace Suite to a Wraparound Suite on the 36th floor of the East tower. The staff member checking us in was very helpful and explained how the $260 credit worked etc. The 'wow' factor started as soon as we opened the door to a huge entrance hallway with multiple mirrored doors and closets, the size of the suite was incredible and the high ceilings added to the feeling of spaciousness. The kitchen contained a fridge with spare room for our own items, although we put most of our drinks into the small wine fridge as this was totally empty. There were some glasses to use but no knives and forks etc. However, we kept some utensils in our room from when we ordered room service. The Lounge and Dining area was extremely comfortable with a round dining table with four chairs, an L shaped lounge suite and a leather reclining chair near the door to the balcony. The computer desk was also functional with the TV above it and we connected easily to the internet (free of charge) via our netbook and ipad. The bedroom contained an extremely comfortable King sized bed, large chest of drawer and 2 bedside cabinets. The main bathroom was huge with a separate toilet, his and her's sinks separated by a large shower and also contained a very deep spa bath. The wraparound terrace was amazing and so was the view over the Bellagio fountains and the strip and Rio to the left. There were three big outdoor chairs to sit on and these balconies are extremely private, you could not see anyone at either side. We did have a technical issue with the tv/phone/internet one night and when we returned to our room the next day the whole telephone system had been replaced with new equipment.

I selected it because it was the closest Marriott-affiliated property to Caesar\u2019s Palace. After it opened and I read the reviews, I arrived prepared not to like the Cosmo. I expected it to cater to 20-somethings and 30-somethings which we clearly are not. Maybe it does, but it does so much more. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, this facility impressed me. I can\u2019t imagine ever wanting to stay anywhere else when we return to Vegas. We had online directions to reach the parking garage which does not front on LV Blvd. It was not confusing at all as other reviewers have complained. We found a space quickly with the aid of the red light/green light system, noted our parking level and general relationship to the elevators and rode up to the lobby in the west tower There were multiple reception desk employees with a few people lined up in front of each. We had less than a one minute wait before we were at the desk being checked into our room in the west tower \u2013 a Terrace Studio on the 20th floor. Elevators to the west tower rooms were conveniently located near the reception area. A note about the elevators: In all the times we rode them up and down, we never had more than a 30 second wait for an elevator to arrive. The elevators were never crowded \u2013 usually we were the only ones riding \u2013 and they arrived at our floor quickly. We have stayed in properties where we had to always allow 15 minutes for an elevator ride up or down. Not the case here. This property is so different from anything else on the strip that we saw. Other casinos have themes and are beautiful in their own way, but, to me, none could hold a candle to the Cosmopolitan. The Cosmopolitan is classy. The d\u00e9cor is classy. Of particular note is the fact that there are so many seating areas throughout the bottom 4 floors. I didn\u2019t realize the importance of this until we visited other casinos and found absolutely no place to sit unless you go to a bar, a gaming table or a restaurant. While understanding the business rationale for forcing people toward the income-producing aspects of the property, as a customer, I appreciate just being able to sit for a few minutes and enjoy the ambiance or simply people-watch. You can do this in the Cosmo. While some consider the predominately black, white, silver, crystal, metal, glass combination to be cold, I consider it to be elegant. The Cosmo is elegant with touches of whimsy. Art work is plentiful and often unexpected or unusual, yet it works! The grouping of larger than life size canine statues in the middle of the floor is an example. And the music fits the d\u00e9cor perfectly. I found myself continually wanting to meet the design team for the property as they were right on in terms of coming up with a visual/auditory/spatial coordination that transcends age in its appeal. Our terrace studio room with its balcony overlooked the Bellagio fountains \u2013 meaning we had a great view of the strip, too. The room exceeded all expectations for roominess, comfort, convenience and visual appeal. I especially liked the one-touch light control for all the lights in the room (the hello/goodbye buttons by the door) and in the sleeping area and the total control of everything via the TV remote. Everything is automated \u2013 even the minibar. A note of caution here\u2026.as tempting as it may be to pick up a mini bar item and look at it, unless you intend to buy it\u2026don\u2019t touch! Apparently there is a motion detector on the bottom of each compartment in the minibar tray (and doubtless some sort of sensor in the refrigerator). If you move an item, you are charged for it. It doesn\u2019t matter that you set it back into the tray. This was the one small hiccup in our stay: 2 minibar charges on our bill when we checked it the night before our departure. We had not used any minibar item. A call to the front desk resulted in being transferred to another person where I was placed on hold for 10 minutes. I gave up on the hold and went in person to Reception where the charge was removed from our bill. Though a bit more cumbersome than I would have liked, I was satisfied with the staff\u2019s resolution of the problem. For purposes of our visit to LV, The Cosmopolitan was within easy walking distance of Caesar\u2019s Palace where we had tickets for a performance. While we took taxis to further points along the strip to explore, taking a taxi to/from Caesar\u2019s would have taken much longer than the walk did given the traffic on the strip at night. The Cosmopolitan captured my heart and soul. I am a huge fan and will be back!

The large shower was nice; too bad the water only got above tepid on one day of my five day stay.

I realize that Vegas is Sin City, but after visiting other hotels on the strip, there are better alternatives when you want to get away from the night life for a break from the options than The Cosmopolitan. When I booked the room in November for my January trip, I was assured a view of the Bellagio fountains. When I checked in however, I had a view of the pool behind the hotel, and part of Harmon street - NOT what I had paid for. The good news is, when I called the front desk they changed my room so that I had a full on view of the Bellagio and Caesar's. Sitting on the private terrace and watching the fountains at night was quite breath taking! I had a Terrace Studio, and it was quite spacious. Nice linens on the bed, goose down everything and high thread count. Large bathroom with an enormous shower and a deep soaking tub. Overall, the room was clean, but the mini bar area was so dusty you could write your name in the dust. For what the room cost, it was reasonably appointed. I searched several sites, and ended up getting the best deal directly through the hotel. My package included a $260.00 food and beverage allowance during my stay, and that was not offered on any other sites. We ate at Holstein's our first night there - the food was amazing!! If you don't eat anything else, you must have the lobster and truffle macaroni and cheese. They also boast 100 varieties of beer, and a fantastic selection of milkshakes. The second night, we had dinner reservations at Milos. I requested a window seat when making the reservation three weeks in advance - again, we were not originally granted our request. The restaurant was not very busy, and I had to ask the hostess to move us to the window. She did so after a conversation with her manager. Despite this small glitch, I would happily go back to Milos. The food was fresh, flavorful, and worth every single cent. The staff is stellar, and our meal was delightly planned with their direction. I also highly recommend breakfast at the Wicked Spoon. Absolutely anything that you would want for breakfast, including the most flaky cinnamon rolls I've ever encountered. The chef studied for 7 years in Europe, and you can readily see that influence in the delectable food and beautiful presentation. Again, the staff was on point - especially for a buffet! Long story short - if you appreciate and understand gourmet food, go here to eat. Hands down some of the best food I've ever eaten, and a huge variety of flavors at that. If you appreciate a night club atmosphere, stay here. The next trip I take to Vegas, I'll visit The Cosmopolitan for dinner and the artwork that adorns the walls, but I will absolutely stay somewhere different!", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cI wish I stayed longer- fantastic!\u201d", "Author": "sparklesque", "ReviewID": "UR93659747", "Content": "Although I fortunate enough to experience the Cosmpolitan, it was for one night, but I would definitely go back if I had the chance. First off, the decor was absoluted beautiful. It was modern, comfortable, whimsical, and elegant with a theme of blues and purples. We had a \"normal\" room with a premium view, and premium it truly was. Our room was on the 21st floor overlooking the the Bellagio fountains and the Paris hotel. Because our room had an outside terrace, I could listen to the fountain music and have a perfect view of the water show. Our room had a huge bathroom, glass doors on the shower, a big separate tub, and although it was open to the living/sitting area, it also had a shade that could be drawn if you wanted privacy in the tub or shower. I hate it when showers or tubs don't have the option of being private, so this was a nice touch. The toilet was in a separate room in it's own space. The sitting area had an L-shaped couch, flat screen TV, kitchenette, dishwasher(!), and mini-bar. The bed, next to the doorwall to the terrace was so comfortable and plush. I could lay in the bed and look at the lights of the strip. There was another flat screen TV in the bed area. The room service menu was excellent, tons of choices and at reasonable prices. The pancakes were about $13, and this is how I guage how outrageous room service prices are. $13 isn't that bad at all for hotcakes, as I've seen them for $25+ elsewhere which is ridiculous. I visited the spa, which was heaven. I had a facial and massage. The spa was first rate, with friendly and helpful staff, with all of the amenities you'd ever need. They had a steam room, a cold steam refreshing room, sauna, hot tub with rain drop area, and an outdoor quiet pool area which was separate from the party pools found elsewhere in the hotel. The casino portion of the hotel was gorgeous, with tons of hanging crystals, many interesting shops and restaurants.", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tacoma, WA", "Title": "\u201cStellar views, amazing rooms, weak service\u201d", "Author": "RulesLawyer", "ReviewID": "UR93651482", "Content": "This is the only hotel I've ever checked into which didn't generate a single scrap of paper. My online reservation failed at the final screen, but a call to the hotel confirmed that it was made. My confirmation number wouldn't bring up the reservation. Check-in was fast, but all electronic. Check-out was electronic as well. I splurged and reserved a wraparound terrace suite, and was very pleased with room 3793. The room's furnishings met my high expectations, and the 270\u00b0 view of PH towers, Bally's, Paris, the north strip, Caesars, Bellagio, the mountains, and Aria were astounding. The kitchen supplies, however... With a kitchen that large, I expected some kind of cookware. Yes, there was a barware set, and a set of six stemmed glasses, but otherwise the only kitchenware looked like someone went to Safeway: a bag of plastic keg cups, a bag of paper plates, a bag of paper bowls, and a handful of plastic forks. The previous occupants of the room had left several items in the minibar, including a half-drank bottle of Coke, a half used bottle of salsa, and an unused vegetable tray. An empty bottle of Dos Equis, was left on the terrace. Come to thiunk about it, they may have left the paper picnic-ware, too. We asked the front desk to remove the leftover food (so that we wouldn't be charged when it set off the weight sensors), but they never did. I'd think that a room with a dishwasher, a stove, and an oven would have some kind of cookware... a cookie sheet, a pot, some way to boil water, perhaps? No luck there. We called down to ask if they could send up some coffee for the coffee pot, but they never did. We didn't get a price list for the minibar until we went downstairs to ask for it. (Remember? No paper at check in.) We grabbed coffee while we were down there, but it took forever -- coffee is apparently housekeeping's responsibility, and -- true quote -- it's not something the front desk does. There was no room service menu and no binder describing the hotel's amenities. Perhaps it's all in the TV, but making reservations for dinner through the TV failed (\"no phone number on file\"). Like a lot of people, we didn't realize the drawers under the minibar were freezer drawers, so we had to thaw out several drinks. The TV was unwatchable, running at about 15 frames per second. Weak satellite signal? No idea. One phone didn't work at all, the other said we had voice mail when we didn't. At around 3:45, we called the hotel from my cell phone to make reservations at China Poblano. They said nothing was available at 5:00, but the earliest they had was 6:45. I told them never mind, and we decided to wander the hotel to see what other restaurant choices were available. At China Poblano, at about 5:00, we approached the nearly empty restaurant and on a whim, asked for a table for the four of us. We were seated immediately. Despite all the service snafus, I'd stay there again in a heartbeat. I paid a relative pittance for the room on a Sunday night (offset by a free $100 food credit) and really felt like a high roller.

However it is possible to peep your head off the ledge and strain your neck to get a quick peek + a small bathroom-stall-size gap in the wall, between the bedroom/balcony, enables you to barely see into the next balcony. The bottom line is there is nothing to worry about. You will fall over the ledge if you try to do this to look at the people next door, due to the amount of leaning, so again, no need to worry about privacy. The Hotel amenities/rooms/location/decor/casino/everything will put MGM/Caesars on their heels, which will provide better experiences for all tourists/locals involved.

I called to front desk and they remotely rebooted the phone later in the day to fix it. 3) A very cute sounding staffer left me a voice mail saying my phone should be fixed, at the end you could hear her whisper something to the person next to her, almost like \"hang up now?\" \" I made a few special requests' which they were happy to help me out with; 1) expedite a bottle of champaign to my room 2) my breakfast order room service packed to-go on my last day.

Overall the hotel is GREAT. We normally stay at THE, Bellagio, or Wynn. I will try to do my best to outline each area see below. CHECKIN: We used car service(recommend presidential limo they are great), upon arrival a doorman opened the door and asked if we needed assistance with luggage. The doorman escorted us to the front door opening both doors and directed us to the check in area. We were greeted by fine dressed man who escorted us to an awaiting person at the front desk. Check in was smooth and the gentleman who checked us also escorted us through the hotel giving us brief overview and to the elevators. That was nice. Real smooth no long lines etc as some other reviews had noted. NOTE: they were sold out the first 2 days with CES and AEE in town and we still were checked in 2 hours early.. ROOM: located in east tower that is the one closest to the boulevard. Really nice rooms ALOT of room in 1 bedroom terrace suites. Everything was new as it has just opened. Alot of weird books on art, not my thing but nice room over all. We were on the 29th floor of I believe 36 floor building,. NO issues with water pressure or hot water.. Lights can be controlled from tv or from switches. Technology in the room is fun to play around with as you control everything temp, lights for example I shut the lights off on my wife while she was in the tub lol... Good size closet, not walk in but plenty of room good thing as there are NO drawers. The door to the toilet is heavy and closes hard so be careful. Bathroom and shower/tub area is well lite. My wife did note that there was no makeup mirror. The bedroom is nice, bed is comfortable, no alarm clock though (it is built into the tv, I could not get it to work though)and the phone has an annoying lite screen, my wife just put a wash cloth over it and that took care of that. Only had one day of problems with the tv and phone the last day was resolved though. refrigerator has no room except underneath all the purchaseable items be careful as it is a freezer so water will be frozen or juice etc. Watching my wife try to eat the frozen yogurt i put down there was funny. terrace is nice, but it was so cold we spent no time on it,. Turn down service each night, each night they left a artsy book on the bed, nice touch , but I would rather have had a chocolate. There is floor to ceiling window between bedroom and the shower with wooden blind and just a wooden blind between the soaking tub and bedroom. There are alot of goodies in the fridge and on the counter all on motion sensitive plates so unless you want to pay, LOOK BUT DONT TOUCH, Do not look for any reference guides to the room or hotel it is all on the tv, HOTEL: Take the time to explore the hotel which is huge and has many nooks and crannys and quiet places to sit and talk and relax. Pizza place is on 3rd floor, down a long hallway it was busy when we stopped we got one pie it was good and quick. 3rd floor also has pool table fuzz ball table and a number of nice sitting areas to socialize etc. Crowds were middle aged to older. Not alot of kids seen, definately not a hotel for kids. We ate at Wicked Spoon, food selection was very good. Be prepared though the buffet serves most of food in tiny dishes, which are fun, and save you from eating like a horse. WickedSpoon also had gellatio which Bellagio and Wynn do not have on their buffets, also is cheaper. Food was great and once open for awhile this buffet will be on par with two mentioned above. We did not eat in any other eateries. Word of mouth was the mexican and burger place were good. Hotel has good access to strip as well as city center. The pools were actually open and heated. Once nice weather rolls around I can see their not being enough pools space for all the hotel guests, so just keep that in mind. Everywhere you go there are large touch screen monitors which will allow you to see map of the building give restaraunt info etc. They also provide flight info on these screens as well. One item to note is there are 4 or 5 concierge desks through out the first floor which is nice. They assisted in printing out boarding pass for our departure. Overall hotel was great we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would not think twice about returning. Obviously the hotel is still working out the bugs but overall it is a really nice boutique hotel atmosphere hopefully it stays that way, Got tickets to Le Reve at Wynn, show was great, with a bit of humor. CASINO: Well laid out with a numbe of bars throughout. Variety of slots and table games to meet everyones liking. OVERALL: No real complaints, if they keep working it will be one of the best hotels on the strip. Oh ya there is small kitchenette microwave, sink, empty cupboards fridge and a dishwasher (not sure why). We would definately stay again in warmer time of year to enjoy the terraces.

Since I had to come to visit Las Vegas for CES, and I saw that The Cosmopolitan was featured on the Ritz Carlton website, I thought I would try this new hotel. What a colossal disappointment! Instead of finding the quiet, elegant, refined luxury that I have come to expect from Ritz Carlton, I instead discovered a noisy, tacky, gaudy property teeming with wannabe hipsters seeking a wall-to-wall ultralounge experience. I can only echo comments that others have provided: check-in took an eternity; waiting for my bags to get to my room took even longer; the staff is clueless and poorly-trained. Once in my room, the room was large (which I suppose should be expected as the rooms were intended to be condos, before the current owner foreclosed on the property) and the view was nice, but the water pressure was so low that it was almost impossible to take a decent shower. Before going to bed the first night, I stepped out onto the balcony to take in the view, and when I returned to my room the door wouldn\u2019t latch! I wanted to call downstairs to report this, but as others have commented, the phone didn\u2019t work! Just dead air!

I'll try to cover as much as possible. Before arriving I was hesitant as the reviews on here are very mixed.... (1st Floor) - The casino. State of the art and very eye appealing. Sports book had great odds and free drinks for every $10 bet. (2nd Floor) - Restaurants/Buffet. The Chinese/Mexican to go was expensive. Food was good for late night food, but wouldn't go out of my way to eat there. Buffet - Absolutely incredible. Great attention to detail and every dish we had was amazing. This trip we ate at the Wynn (subpar for the $ this trip), Bellagio (decent for the $ but felt it lacked Bellagio's normal quality), Cosmopolitan (would visit again in a heartbeat). Let me say this though... I don't know if the first two lacked because of the CES crowd but I was disappointed with quality, however my last trip the Wynn & Bellagio were both great. (The room) Terrace one bedroom. 1st impressions - Wow! Every guest we had brought all had the same first impression. * The couch was comfy and spacious, the tv in the living room pulled out and swiveled and was a good viewing distance. * The desk under the TV had a light that DID reflect into the mirror, however if you took a second to inspect it, it turned towards the desk and no longer glared. * The closets were spacious, however lacked any drawers for clothing, there were some shelfs in there but it wasn't enough room for two. * The safe was spacious, had enough room for two 13\" computers, wallets, etc... * The bathroom was layed out perfect in our opinion. There was a sliding door that closed off the entire bathroom. There is a lack of privacy if you are staying with family or friends however. The shower has a glass door, there is a glass wall that looks into the bedroom and the japanese soaking tub does open up into the bedroom. However there are some very thick blinds that close the soaking tub & shower wall if you don't want anyone seeing in. I wouldn't say this is great as a shared room, but it is manageable, for a couple there shouldn't be any problems. * The bedroom - Comfortable and we slept great each night. I would say it is just as comfortable as the Encore's bed. * Electronics - The TV controlled everything. Lighting, climate, music, etc... It was user friendly and worked fine each time we used it. You can even set alarms to wake at a certain time by doing different functions... I.E: Turning on lights, going to a certain channel (volume), turning on music, etc... at a certain time. You can even set a wake up call. We got to try the new phones and they were alot better than the old ones (we had the old one the first night) * Terrace - Incredible! Who has a terrace in vegas... It was great to be able to stand outside on the balcony and take it all in... * Service - Great. Very helpful staff and everyone went out of their way to make things right. Cons or potential cons: Sometimes calling downstairs to the front desk would just ring, no one would answer. Twice it took two calls to get someone to pick up. Hopefully they resolve this soon. The phone was also bright at night. The technology manager said they are working on this, hopefully a dim option comes out. Either find a dim option or move the phone to the living room, I am not sure it is necessary in the bedroom. We put a towel over the screen at night... Error on our room service charges. There was a mixup on our room charges and we had been charged extra. However a call to the front desk and it was taken care of. (service was great) Internet was spotty. It didn't work every time. I think they need to only allow hotel guests access to wifi, instead of the public. It was fine at odd times, but when the hotel was busy it was very slow. The electronics did have some bugs... The phone time was wrong, sometimes the VOIP calls were spotty, the tv does let you hook up hdmi or video in, but if you switch it on the tv there wasn't a way to go back to the default input. Noise, we found if the terrace door wasn't closed all the way you could hear some of the music from the outdoor bar. We have a few sound apps on our Ipods so this wasn't a problem. (note to others) you can actually hook up an MP3 to the new phones but you do need a 3.5mm plug. I am not sure if the hotel had any to borrow because I didn't ask... I would stay there again without a doubt.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cAvoid at all costs\u201d", "Author": "Jumper9071", "ReviewID": "UR92023921", "Content": "My wife and I made the mistake of getting a room here for a three day get-away.

The staff (although pleasant) had no idea where anything was, how anything worked, who was in charge of what, etc. The physical hotel itself is fairly drab. Other than the \"chandelier\" which serves as a hotel focal point there is very little Vegas pizazz. The building feels rather corporate and under decorated. The predominate color in the public areas is brown. The walls in the rooms are grey. The pools are fairly small for a hotel of this size.

Full of eye candy from the decor to modern art to room details. The only thing we didn't care for was the in-room coffee.

Everything mentioned in both December 29th reviews by Patty B54 and Kingman 26 is true!

The Cosmopolitan just opened on December 15th. You should expect one or two glitches. We had difficulty with our phones and were moved to a different room. Our first room had some left over desert in the fridge. Its a first class 5 star hotel which means there are SO many details that it will take a while for everything to flow perfectly. Everyone WANTS to help you and follows up to see that issues are resolved. They have a CAN DO attitude and a warm wonderful front desk manager (Gary Abbs ~thank you for taking care of us, the coffee was great and my husband enjoyed the orange juice. Good luck and Happy New Year). As a guest, if you have problems take the time to call down. They WANT you to have a perfect stay. We were more than pleased with everyone who we dealt with. Room service makes you feel like royalty. We used it multiple times (VERY good coffee, a bit too expensive, $13.00 large pot including service charge) including the best wings i have ever had twice, a crab cake and a simple burger. We ate at Holsteins, Wicked Spoon buffet, Comme Ca (wonderful server and I forget her name!!) and The Henry (Heather you were such a sweet lovely server!!). Both had there own somaliers who helped this Canadian gal choose amazing California whites! You really never need to leave The Cosmopolitan as it is a huge state of the art, interior designed, pleasure palace. (don't worry, we did! Its Vegas!!) The concierge was very helpful to us. And, finally the fact that you have a line on your phone for \"Beck and Call\" simply, really says it all. (They know that they are having issues with their mini bar because it charges you after you have picked up an item to look at it for more than about 60 seconds! Just make sure both your fridge and snacks have been completely replenished and then keep track of what you use!!!! Personally, I think they should have a locking cover or something so the guest can lock it as it would be a nightmare if you have a few children or a cocktail party with curious guests!!) Lastly, comment to hotel manager: We would have appreciated more personal fridge space and less mini bar along with a few pieces of cutlery, extra glasses, wine glasses and dishes... we, like many guests, often bring a few snacks of our own. Many people have dietary restrictions, allergies, etc. Why would there be a dishwasher and wine fridge if you did not expect guest to do so? Why would you promote the kitchens and fridges?

Yes, it has only been open for just over one week, but the service standard is terrible and inexcusable for a five-star hotel. First, upon checking-in, I was assigned to the East Tower, which is on the other end from the lobby. You will have to walk through the casino in order to reach the East Tower, which is by the Las Vegas Boulevard entrance and contains all the restaurants. I walked into my room and found that it was not cleaned, as remnants of the previous guests' room service dinner were on full display. I called down to request for a new room, but the person who took my call said that he will arrange for housekeeping; I pointed out that the norm would have been to assign me a new room, and was told that he could phone the front desk to find out. There was no apologies offered nor did the person on the phone offer to have someone from the front desk phone me right away to arrange for room change. After going back downstairs to get a new room assigned to me (with no offers from the Concierge or the front desk to make my stay better), I found out that my luggage has gone missing with the bell boy. Apparently, half of their elevators were down. I finally got my luggage 40 minutes later after spotting the bell boy pounding on the door of the soiled room originally provided to me. I finally had the chance to unpack and assess the room. The terrace was a nice touch and I could watch the Bellagio fountains throughout the day. The bathroom was well-lit and clean, with a shower and soaker tub by the window. Overall, the room was well-decorated and spacious. Unfortunately, the shower had weak pressure, while the fan/air conditioning in the room was inconsistent throughout the night. Housekeeping was dreadful and each seem to have a different standard of cleanliness, of what needs to be replenished and when they would service the room. I came back one day at 3:30 p.m. and found that my room was still not cleaned. After requesting for room service 3 times, they finally came around at 5 p.m. Another time, I came back to find that they left the dirty bed sheets by the bed. You will find that service is badly lacking. When the sliding doors to the terrace became stuck, I requested that maintenance come by to fix it. Between 2:00 p.m. and 5:30 p.m., I requested that they come by four times and was assured that they would attend to my request immediately each time. To have to follow-up with the staff in order to get your requests fulfilled is just counterintuitive. This is not to mention that one of the TV was not working, the phone in my room was not in service for over a day, the fridge had brown residue in it and housekeeping never once cleaned it up. The atmosphere of the hotel is similar to that of a W. At night, the music in the common space is loud and it becomes a huge party environment. Those seeking peace and quiet can forget about it. Decoration on floors one and two verges on decadent and tacky. While it wasn't a bad stay, this is not the level of service I expect from a five-star property.

I usually go to vegas 5-7 times a year for the past 10 years so I know my hotels well there. The novelty of the Cosmopolitan is great being brand new. The facilities are grandiose and rooms pristinely clean. Having patios especially overlooking the Bellagio water shows is awesome! But that is where the novelty ends. Check-in was very slow but friendly. We ate at 3 of the restaurants, and the service for each of them was VERY ERRATIC to say the least. China Poblano is a chinese-mexican fusion that never should have taken place. The chinese and mexican were bad, but the fusion foods were terrible! I am open-minded to anything but this restaurant was a disaster. Not to mention that the service was like pulling teeth. STK had good food, but the service was so bad that I cannot recommend this place to anyone. There are so many great steak houses in Vegas, this one is one of the worst. Why would a steak house have only wine of each type available by the glass? Why would you bring a dish with gluten when we requested gluten-free? Why would a salad not be divided in two when we requested it? WHy would side dishes come half hour after you served the entrees? Why would a server just be an overall arrogant snob? You get the my meaning, don't go to STK. Blue ribbon sushi is very good, but very expensive. Sushi piece prices are per single piece, so the tab will be double what you are used to. The quality was great, but my wife and I prefer Social HOuse or Koi over Blue RIbbon. The lone star of service in any of the Cosmopolitan's restaurants was MAC, our server at Blue Ribbon. Simply request him, he could work at any place in Vegas! Now to the games, great looking casino with stellar dealers. I really enjoyed them. However, the drink selections at the tables was very limited. You will like this casino if you like intimate atmospheres. If you like massive, wide-open casinos then go to the Venetian, MGM, Mandalay Bay, or New York New York. The room, we got a Terrace Suite which was a great size with a stellar view of the Bellagio fountain. It was high-tech with an interactive TV. OUtside of that the room was awful. A HUGH shower with NO PRESSURE! It was like taking a shower under a sink. The safe was inoperable and no-one seemed to care about fixing it even when asked on two occasions. If at the Venetian, Wynn, or Bellagio the service would have been immediate. The twin sinks also had no pressure. Moreover, the bed was the least comfortable my wife and I ever had in Vegas. We had 2 restless nights of sleep. The room has a kitchenette, but no table. Who is the genius who thought of this? It was obvious that the rooms were condos and mid-construction they decided to make it a hotel. It would have been nice to have drawers instead of a useless kitchen sink (except to brush our teeth, it had pressure). The greatest asset this hotel had is the spa! The facilities were world class and the cool mist room after the steam room was the bomb! My wife and I thought that our massages were among the best ever! Only our experiences at Maroma, Rosewood Mayakoba, Four Seasons Costa Rica, and Mandarin Oriental in Miami were better. Cleo and Jen are worth asking for. Overall, this hotel has a lot of kinks to work out. If you like attention to detail when you travel, avoid this place and go to Palazzo, Wynn, or Bellagio. If you like new experiences, you probably should check this place out in a couple of months when the kinks get worked out.", "Date": "December 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cAwesome!\u201d", "Author": "mhisme1", "ReviewID": "UR90634710", "Content": "Ok, we have been to Vegas about 40 times in the past 5 years and have stayed at literally everywhere on the Strip including the Encore and Wynn Suites. We stayed in a One Bedroom Terrace Suite in the East Towers on the weekend before Christmas and only 3 days after the opening of the Hotel. Make no mistake, it was FABULOUS. The EAST rooms are the place to stay as our room looked directly over the Bellagio fountains with a large balcony and a view down the strip. It was so awesome! The only downside I would say would be some of the service in the restaurants which they will get figured out in time. Everyone was friendly including all service people and even walking by the empty crap tables in the morning the dealers went out of their way to say hello. Given our experiences, I can not agree with any negative review of the place other than a few new wrinkles that will be worked out. Upon leaving, we were even given a complimentary (though we tipped well) private car back to the airport. Marriott is booking the hotel through its point system and on the Ritz website. We have done many of both and I would put this hotel definitely towards the top of either. Though it has 3000 rooms, it feels kinda boutique. And for your Vegas lovers, get this, they track your hotel, restaurant, AND gambling play, what a concept for LV! Questions, feel free to write as I have no negatives on this one. Id choose it again. On Par with Wynn and Encore and Palazzo for sure, if not better.", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "las vegas", "Title": "\u201cAmong newer hotels in LV COSMO is above the rest\u201d", "Author": "lulum6437", "ReviewID": "UR90624854", "Content": "From the time you enter the lobby you are greeted by numerous associates that direct you in the right direction.

It took 3 phone calls and an email on my part to get anyone to respond. Finally, I got somebody to correspond with me and set rates for my group of 25-30. I mentioned that we needed a private room in the restaurant for our Saturday night dinner, and they told me they had the perfect spot. When I got the email, there was a $5,000 minimum to have the private room in the steak restaurant. I let them know that I had been booking this trip for 30 years, in the finest hotels in Vegas, and that nobody had been nervy enough to assess me a \"minimum\" to bring 30 guests to dinner, plus the 4 nights we would have stayed and played. And in this economy? Are you kidding me??? I asked them to take it to the manager and waive the fee, but they politely refused, even for hotel guests. A new hotel, not even open yet, turning away business over a room minimum for dinner? We typically spend $100 per person or more for Saturday dinner, so I know I would have been close, but there is no way I was going to be on the line for late cancellations or not hitting the \"minimum\". I told them thanks, but no thanks and we are now moving our group to the Aria, where they not only gave us great rates, but gave us a concierge to assist with making sure Saturday night's dinner is perfect, and without a minimum!
