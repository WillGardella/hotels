Arrived late and parked in the basement car park before checking in. First impressions of the car park were poor, it is full of leaves and windblown debris and feels rather unused, but the hotel reception and common areas were both contemporary and attractive. Check in was quick although the Friday night music in the adjoining bar was so loud that the receptionist had trouble making herself heard. Our room was on the first floor facing the High Road and well insulated from both traffic and the noisy music in the bar, it was very attractive with two wardrobes and a large bathroom. Unfortunately the bathroom lighting foxed us for a while and we spent our first 24 hours washing in very low light. Eventually we figured out that the lightswitch also acted as a dimmer and you increase the brightness by holding it down. We did not have breakfast or use the restaurant during our stay so cannot comment on the food. We would have used the bar but the music was too loud for conversation so we headed up the High Road instead. Gunnersbury tube is very close although note that services to this station are more limited than on other parts of the tube system. Bit of a mix up at checkout as we had not got a parking ticket when we drove in. Parking is \u00a312.50 per 24 hours so allow for this when you are looking at the room rates.

It's very close to the tube station and an easy half hour journey in, enabling us to see the sights but stay in a far more comfortable hotel than we'd have got for the price in central London itself. It's also close to the London Science and Natural History museums, and Kew Gardens is just a nice stroll down the river path. We'd booked 3 standard rooms but were upgraded to deluxe, which was an unexpected bonus. The bath is to die for, simply huge and so luxurious. There was also a big shower cubicle. The chaise longue in our rooms was a nice extra touch. Customer service was great- we had a few minor requests re heating controls and bathroom fans which were swiftly and courteously attended to. Take your own bottle of water - the ones in the room are \u00a33.50 each! We liked the fact that the day tube travel cards are valid on buses too. There is a very frequent bus service down the High Street and the bus stops just outside the hotel. Rather than eat out in the centre, we caught the bus down the high street where there is a great choice of restaurants- we went to Pizza Express but there is also Cafe Rouge and lots others. The bus also goes to White City/ Shepherd's Bush where there is an excellent Westfield Shopping Centre, which our teenage girls simply loved. Just a short bus journey away! The only slight disappointment was that the hotel website said it was possible to buy day passes to Esporta Health Club at reduced rates, so we all took our costumes as we planned to fit in a swim. The deal no longer applies and we felt that the website should have been amended to say so, as that was one of the reasons we chose the hotel.

I asked for somewhere near Heathrow, with good access to the centre of London. Chiswick Moran hotel is in Zone 3, so people who need to get there by train as I did would need to buy the more expensive travel card. The hotel is very close to the station (less than a 2 minute walk) but the station itself has no lifts so it can be a pain with luggage. It's on the District Line, with trains coming normally every 10 minutes or so, though when I was there they were much less frequent. In order to get to Heathrow, you would need to go back to Hammersmith then go back on yourself. I wouldn't say it was convenient. My room was lovely, clean and fresh. The gossip and fashion magazines put out for me were a nice touch. The bathroom was a little weird with its triangular toilet and sink, but overall the room was excellent. I also ordered room service, which came quickly, was good value for money and tasty. The area around the hotel seemed pretty safe, and it was quite quiet too. When I booked, I was told that there was free internet, which was great because I had a bit of work to do during my stay. When I turned on my laptop I was told that the internet in my room costs 15 pounds a day. I needed to use it, so paid out. When I when to the main desk, I asked the girl there about the advertised free internet. She told me it referred to the one public computer in the corner. I replied that they might want to re-word their description on the website, to which she gave me a somewhat sassy reply and said that since the public computer was free, it's ok. As I left the hotel on my last day (after 2 nights), I decided to use the public computer as it had a printer. I was told to insert coins into the machine in order to use the computer. I don't mind paying for internet - though 15 pounds a day for wireless and 1 pound for 10 minutes on a public computer is extremely expensive - but the false advertising and the sass from the girl at the desk really made me mad.

Most could not manage a smile or a greeting, even when I approached them, I always had to initiate the conversation. The attention to detail is poor and there are many examples of this throughout the hotel. The hotel looks tired and most of the public areas are grubby.

A complimentary continental is no problem, but having to get your own tea and coffee when there are staff hanging around is quite irritating, even more so when the hot water runs out and isn't replenished despite being asked!

If you are planning to stay here during vacations to make some tourism you will be out of Central London. However, the location is excellent for Business Travelers to the area of Brentford. You are her in walking distance to Worsley-Parsons Office, as well as other several business in the area. The hotel can be reached easily by the tube from Gunnersbury station, which is excellent to go to Central London. But from Heathrow is not an easy connection to reach the hotel by tube, and is much faster to get there by cab. There are not many options of restaurants in walking distance from the Hotel, which might be a limitation. There is one small minimarket across the street and a gas station nearby. - Reception Reception staff is always friendly . - Rooms The rooms have a look and design of the 70's . They are comfortable, with very good size ( for being in London ) , and very quite. There is internet in the room available also, as well as a flat screen TV with local channels. - Restaurant The breakfast is Irish style, which is very similar to a full English breakfast. The quality and service is good. In the evening, the bar of the hotel offers a good selection for dinner.

One tip: if you don't want to eat in the hotel restaurant (bit pricey) walk up Chiswick High Street (out the entrance, turn left) and keep walking for around 10 minutes, you'll come across a vast array of different restaurants - Lebanese, Thai, Italian etc. I can completely and wholeheartedly recommend the Thai Kitchen and Carluccio's (reviews to come shortly).

Our room was right near the lifts so very noisy in the morning, I didn't sleep well at all. I am a vegetarian and the continental breakfast selection looked rather slim for my dietry requirements so I asked our waiter if it would be possible to have an omelette. Yes, he said and stopped there. I asked him what it might be possible to have in it. He looked at me blankly, so I prompted - tomato? cheese? Yes, he said, and walked away. I called him back, might we be able to order drinks? He took my drink order and walked away, we called him back as he hadn't asked my friend what she had wanted at all. It is a pretty basic part of the role of a waiter to take an order from both guests and ask both parties if they would like a drink. Needless to say we cancelled our order and went elsewhere for breakfast. That nights room service was equally bad, and it took a ten minute discussion for my friend to get them to add cheese to her ham and cheese sandwich as according to room service they could not put cheese in the ham sandwich as this was not how the sandwich appeared on the menu. I would not think in a four star hotel it would be too much trouble to put a bit of cheese in between two slices of bread. When it finally arrived, accompanied with corn chips and ketchup (?) my cheese sandwich had a frozen lump of grated cheese-mass in the middle. A little outrageous for \u00a37. For a Four Star hotel I found the service to be pretty appalling, it's clear the staff really couldn't care less about their guests at all. The final nail in the coffin was when we received a call at 11am on the 29th from reception to say \"When you leave?\" Even giving the benefit of the doubt that the member of staff may be new to the English language I'm sure as a receptionist they must know the term 'check out.'

The staff member he spoke to was very rude and unapologetic. I consider this completely unacceptable. Not only did a staff member fail to carry out the request, but then to be spoken to so rudely is beyond unacceptable. Moreover, if my boyfriend hadn't rung to check- there is no way he would've known that there were no roses waiting in our room. This was deeply dissapointing for me and I hope the staff members know how much they have dissapointed both me and my boyfriend.

I was also very pleased with the standard of food in the Globe Bar.

The hotel is situated about 3 mins away away from Gunnersbury station and ideally positioned just a few hundred yards outside of the Congestion charging zone! The train into central London takes about 15/20mins- we found it quickest to change trains at Hammersmith to join the underground lines. The hotel itself is bright and modern and easily accessible. Check in is advertised as beginning from 2pm although we were able to obtain a room at approx 12:30pm having arrived earlier than intended. We were allocated a room on the second floor and were amazed by spacious layout. The room was brightly decorated in keeping the the modern feel of the hotel. The bathroom was a fantastic size with a separate bath and shower unit. Our room was equipped with LCD tv (on a swivel platform allowing you to move it closer to the bed), wireless internet access and for the ladies, a decent hairdryer that actually dries hair! The bed was huge and extremely comfortable! Whilst there is very little noise from the road opposite or other guests next door, we were aware of the music being played very loudly in the bar below until about 12:30am-not something that caused concern for us but may affect those with an early start. Breakfast ran between 07:00 and 10:30 and charged at \u00a310 for a Full Irish breakfast (cooked to order) and \u00a38.95 for a Continental breakfast. The hotel offers onsite car parking which is detailed in the welcome pack as \u00a320 for 24 hours. As mentioned in other reviews, this is reduced to \u00a310 for hotel residents if the ticket is validated on checking out. All in all a very pleasant stay and very difficult to find fault!

The following morning ( Sunday) we made our way into the restaurant and were politely greeted by a very curteous and kind young man with an Eastern European accent, who explained to us how the restaurant buffet worked and showed us to a vacant table. The breakfast buffet was of very good quality and replenished continuously. We thouroughly enjoyed our breakfast and the atmosphere in the breakfast room was friendly and welcoming, even though it was busy. I was very impressed with the hotel and the amount of wonderful courteous staff who attended and helped us. Unfortunately this wonderful experience came to an abrupt end the minute we made the aquaintance of the assistant restaurant manager Mark This man greeted us on the Monday morning ( 3rd Nov) by asking our room number and when given stated : You don\u00b4t have breakfast included do you? When I told him that indeed we did and offered to go upstairs to look for our email confirmation, he very charmingly said GOOD GRIEF, where I AM SORRY, would have been more appropriate and then started fiddling with what looked like a printed out list of room numbers and said GOOD GRIEF yet again, before waiving us through to the breakfast room. Then we sat down and shortly after the same man returned to our table with menus, telling us that indeed we only had continental breakfast included and had to pay for warm in case we wanted any. I just said OK fine, we just have continental to the waitress, when MARK returned yet again, saying we could after all have the warm breakfast included. Now I was a little confused.What is going on? I told him, that we already had breakfast here the previous morning and no one had stopped us telling us we couldn\u00b4t eat, so he just said : Don\u00b4t worry, I am not going to charge you for yesterdays\u00b4breakfast!!!!!! This was entirely unnecessary and left me feeling irritated. Then MARK told us again that we were only entitled to contintnental due to a new rule. Now I was just a little puzzled and MARK proceeded to explain to me that once supplier had a new rule and bookings made through them only had continental breakfast from now on. This is all very nice, but WE DIDN`T book through this particular supplier, we booked through Alpharooms, which I pointed out to him. He wasted a few minutes asking me numerous times if I was sure that I booked through Alpharooms and not ( somehting TRAVEL) and GOOD GRIEF was uttered a few times as well.this was accomanied by him rifling through his list of room numbers and rolling his eyes dramatically. By now I felt far from welcome and a little annoyed to be made such a show of in front of all the other guests, looking like I wanted to steal something which I am not entitled to, so I went upstairs and returned with my email confirmation, which I showed to Mark. He read it and then said Good Grief, rifling through the list once more, letting me stand there whilst he went to make a phone call and then returned with another look into the list of room numbers and another Good GRIEF, before he said ok we could now go ahead and order the warm breakfast. We did and when we were about half done eating, MARK returned to the table stood there looming over us and said: OK I just checked and you only were supposed to have had the continental! With that said I was now furious....Can this man not leave things alone!? What did he want me to do now I am half done eating my eggs??? Does he want them back!? Everyone around us was now sniggering and enjoying the scene. I felt like an extra in FAWLTY TOWERS and half expected Basil Fawlty to make an appearance. I felt anger creeping up me, but I am not going to make a scene, so I chose to get up,leaving my half eaten breakfast and walked out, I travel a lot ( business as well as pleasure) and I have to say that in the whole 15 years of frequent travel, I have never felt less welcome by this one individual. This gentleman should be redistributed to another department, where customer contact is not one of his duties. When I travel in my spare time I expect to be able to relax and be treated with respect not having my blood pressure raised. Once again I would like to stress, that EVERYONE else working there has been absolutely delightful and curteous and that the hotel is modern, beautifully furnished in a modern 70\u00b4s twist style and spotlessly clean. Would I recommend this hotel to my best friend ?

Got a great rate through alpharooms. The hotel is really nice, both decor and comfort. We really loved the big walk-in rain shower in the bathroom as well as the big 2 person tub. The bed is possibly one of the comfiest ive ever slept in. The Gunnersby tube is about 5 mins walk away, with a journey of approx 30 mins to Central London. This we found took the good out of our day, especially if the tube was running slow. The Bar is very nice but the selection of draught beer available would need to be looked at, as no Heineken or Carlsberg on tap. It is the first place in London where i have failed to get either on tap. The Aircon controls in room are a bit fiddly but once you get the hang of it, is really nice to have it during the night if the room gets too muggy. We stayed on the top floor and were woken each night by pigoens on the roof, and outside the window, so request a room lower down. The Breakfast was ok but nothing worth writing home about. On the Sunday Morning it was Buffet and the Monday Table Service. We had booked a full breakfast as part of our booking by alpharooms, but when we went down for breakfast first morning we were told that we could only have continental. On explaining that we had booked with a Hot breakfast, the head waiter said no problem go and enjoy your hot breakfast. However we had to go through the whole process again the second morning with another waiter, but once again he did not make a big deal about it. Just a tip for the Hotel Cooks / Chefs - lads rashers should be soft and tender not hard and chewy, obviously they had been in a holding cabinet or something. Housekeeping made up our room, replinished our sugar, coffee and milk on our tray but left our dirty cups, i ask why? All considered it is still a nice hotel, in a nice area, but a bit too far out of London for my liking. However the comfy bed and large bath made up for that.

Air conditioning a tad noisy but when turned off was fine room did not get too hot. After we returned from our night out we were taken aback by how load the hotel bar was.. On a Friday night they blasted really tacky early 90's music, you could even hear it when in the restaurant. The restaurant staff were very helpful and professional. The food was faultless infact a very enjoyable meal, apart from the resounding pounding of the bar tunes. However, when back in the room we could not hear the music - luckily! We breakfasted the next day, the waiter advised our breakfast was not included in the price we were happy to pay extra deal done! We opted for the hot buffet which was perfect just what was required. The hot buffet was \u00a310 per head with the cold buffet \u00a39! We got down to eat fairly early and had no problems although I did have to search for milk! Again the staff very pleasant and helpful when asked. Checked out at 9am but requested that we leave our car there as we were popping into London. No problems with us being allowed to leave it there.

The worst thing was that the cool-looking bar downstairs created an unbelievable amount of noise. The management allows them to keep their base music pumping until 1am on Friday and Saturday nights.

It's refreshing to stay in a hotel that has deliberately veered away from the bland, standard hotel norm of beige, coffee and cream as it is boldly decorated in monochromes accentuated with splashes of bright jewel colours. The carpet is really unusual - it's like hay, quite long and tufty but nice under bare feet! The hotel is well situated for those not wanting to venture by car too far into London, just off the M4 and easy to find. You can park your car at the hotel and the Gunnersbury tube is a minutes walk down the road. Have to say that I've not used the tube in London for years and it is vastly improved from what I remember. It used to be like going into the bowels of the earth and always smelt like a public toilet with filthy trains, but every train we caught was new and clean as were the stations. Anyway, back to the hotel - room was clean, bright , quiet and spacious with a great double shower and good quality beds and linen. Only slight disappointment (and this is being picky) is that there weren't any complimentary biscuits to go with your cup of tea! Breakfast was also good, plenty of choice with attentive staff, and you could settle down and read your complimentary Irish newspaper (Owner is Irish!) at a leisurely pace. We were late back one evening and used room service for our dinner - again no complaints. It was promply served, prices were competitive and food was tasty.

It is small but very nice, with a pretty big bathroom - we had a bath and a walk in shower. The climate was set to 25C and it was too hot to sleep. There were no windows and the air-conditioining is blowing directly to your face while in bed. That was a big minus for me. We had a walk in closed but with no shelves, so it kind of hard to unpack your staff, but it wasn't a problem for us. We had a safe and a tee making machine. The personle was really nice and help with everything we ask for. The breakfast is not that rich. There are just 2 kinds of salami and one day they ran out of yogurt?!? But also included in the price was a irish breakfast with mushrooms, eggs, bacon, sausages - very tasty and very large :). The location is pretty conveniece. The distric line is a couple of minutes from the hotel and it takes you directly to Westminster or Tower of London. If you're going to oxford street you must chage but it's not a problem. Also I would like to advise you not to change at Acton town as stated on the hotel web site if you're going from heathrow, becouse you'll need to change your train again.

To me, it is a perfect retreat in London. It is a couple of minutes walk from the nearest Underground station, and a few minutes from where I used to live in London, in Gunnersbury. It is a four star hotel without relaxation facilities though with a fitness room. I had a four night stay in London, with two nights first in the Crowne Plaza, Docklands, and two nights in this Moran Hotel. I much preferred The Chiswick Moran Hotel to The Crowne Plaza Hotel, Docklands. Even though I had one complimentary night at the The Crowne Plaza Docklands, I still paid over \u00a320 more for the two night Crowne Plaza Hotel stay than for the two nights here, booked through ABA hotels (abahotels.com). Although The Crowne Plaza, Docklands has full leisure facilities, I found I would much rather stay at The Chiswick Moran. I fully recommend The Chiswick Moran. TRY ABAHOTELS.COM. I paid \u00a368 per night for a room for one person which had one area with double bed and comfortable seating and a further, separate area with a single bed and desk and chair. This is one hotel, of only a few, I would pay the hotel's usual rate, which I think is \u00a399 online (more otherwise I believe) for a room for one person. It is good value. As expected, there was a hot drinks tray in the room, a stylish one actually, with safety kettle design. The bathroom was lovely with a large, walk in shower (large round 'monsoon' shower head) and separately, a bath. The restaurant is nice, unpretentious, relaxing and a good place to unwind. The bar I must say is one of the nicer places I have experienced in London. THIS BAR IS WORTH TRAVELLING TO if you are not staying at the hotel. It may seem kind of 'retro' in a seventies style but seems, more than that, very modern and of this decade as much as any. Visit to see. There is free Wi-fi Web network access for guests, also free for visitors to the restaurant aand bar. The bar prices are very good. Also 4 to 7 O' Clock afternoons, excluding Sundays, cocktails are only around \u00a33.50 (I can't remember the exact price.) This was refreshing coming from The Crowne Plaza where, away out near furthest South East London, beyond Canary Wharf, cocktails were \u00a38 a time. Room Web network access is by cable and is not free, though you can pay by half hour or hour rather than by day if you like, which is good, and not so common for four star hotels who often charge only a 24 hour rate. Looking at the photos of rooms taken by other guests on Trip Advisor , I think the room I had was best for me, in subtle dark and light greens and white and mauve, and thick, dangle pile carpets. I thought it was the nicest design room I'd had for ages. I really relaxed. (I actually had gotten sick in The Crowne Plaza, then when I needed to go out, I spent all night in a Central London dance club on my second night, though the garish red and brown decor at that hotel had gradually made me ill anyway.) Staying at The Chiswick Moran really was a tonic. It is a lovely area to stay in, though in the immediate vicinity, not offering attractions beyond a shop and take-aways. It is an extra 15 to 20 minutes on the underground to Victoria than if you were staying in Chelsea or Kensington. For me it is very worth this. The hotel is in relatively quiet Gunnersbury which is at the end of Chiswick, and excellently placed for the huge Gunnersbury Park (lovely, really recommended for any time in London). There is a very small nature reserve, The Gunnersbury Triangle also, worth walking through and sitting in, not far from the hotel, entrance by Chiswick Park underground station. What's more, Richmond is a quite short train journey from Gunnersbury station, also Richmond Park. Kingston is a bus ride from there. I happened to have some special views on suburban London with lovely greenery in the back gardens on the road the window looked onto. Shopping, eating and drinking is good in and around Chiswick High Road, one to two stops on the train, or get on a bus from a stop near the hotel, no extra if you have a one day London Travelcard for your underground train journeys. For me, I would very often prefer to go drinking, and eating, in some of the stylish places in Chiswick, than bother trying to find two or three places in the evening in more Central London. And at least one day of any two day stay, I would be very happy to stay in this lovely hotel for refreshment, sustenance, and pleasure. There is further relaxing lobby seating on the first floor, looking down onto the entrance. For excellently priced car rental near the hotel, there is Aim (aimrentacar.com). They offer very nearly the best rates in London, perhaps Easycar aside, and you can pick up from their branch near the hotel at Chiswick Park station, at Gatwick or Heathrow airports, or delivery to any London location (I don't think to Stansted or Luton airports, though you can check).", "Date": "December 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Hague, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in West London\u201d", "Author": "Polarbjorn", "ReviewID": "UR11227626", "Content": "Due to bad weather I ended up staying an extra night in London.
