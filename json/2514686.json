I had some concerns about the location but in all honesty it wasn't that bad. If you want the touristy feel to where you are staying then this is not the hotel for you. But if you want a decent hotel at an ok price this is a good home base for seeing NYC. We go to NYC multiple times a year and we love to walk everywhere. This was perfect for walking to the world trade center area and we spent the rest of our time in the meatpacking/soho area. If you have the chance definitely try to get to the end of the high line down in the meatpacking district. It was beautiful. So back to the hotel...it was very clean...the room not a bad size considering we were in NYC...the staff was so nice. We didn't try the hotel restaurant b/c we prefer to find something while we are out and about. Take a walk down 6th street (Avenue of the Americas) and try the French Roast for breakfast, it's probably 10-15+ blocks from the hotel. We also didn't realize how many restaurants there were in the meatpacking district which we will try the next time. I would defintely not worry about the area at night. On a Friday night it was pretty quiet around the hotel. Yes it is on a busy street but we walked from the train station on 34th so it didn't matter to us. There were several parking garages in the area and the subway was very close.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cA REALLY GREAT PLACE\u201d", "Author": "Joel R", "ReviewID": "UR127255115", "Content": "This is a really great place to stay.

Upon arrival, we requested a twin room (I'd also made the request by email prior to arrival) only to be told that they didn't have any available. Athough my friend and I are good friends - we aren't * that * close and had no desire to share a bed. However after a couple of minutes the receptionist managed to find a suitable room for us and at no extra charge. The room we were given was on the second floor of the hotel and came with a suprisingly large balcony - alas with it being February it wasn't exactly the sort of weather to sit outside although the weather was nice during the stay. The room itself was fairly small, with limited space for 2 people to hang clothes. The beds themselves were very comfortable and ensured a good nights sleep. Limited amount of complimentary coffee provided but not tea which was a shame. Bathroom was a decent size with a very powerful shower and a deep bath. Left a tip for the chambermaid each day and got a nice note in return each evening when we returned which I thought was a nice touch. Wi-Fi in the hotel is not free except in the lobby and quite expensive compared to what I'm used to in the US.

I went back to Brooklyn and got him so he could stay with my mom for a night or two (he is small - 7 pounds). When I brought him, I let the hotel know and they provided a bed and bowl. The first night, no incident. The second night, my mom and I went to dinner and when we came back to the hotel room, my dog was GONE. There was a note on the bed saying he was at the front desk. Turns out, someone complained that he barked so they removed him. This was pretty disturbing. Again, the hotel staff was SUPER friendly - my dog seemed fine and in good hands. But to remove my dog from the room without my consent? They said we had signed a waiver allowing them to do so, but we were never given a waiver (of course they had us sign one right then). I had my husband come pick up the dog then as I didn't want our pup to be a nuisance nor to be put in a situation like this again, however people traveling with pets from out of town wouldn't have this luxury.

Customer service does not exist. My husband had a business trip in New York and I tagged along for several days. He left very early Monday morning for work and I was in the hotel room by myself when I realized that the linens on the bed had a stain of poop! Grossed that I had slept on it, I called the front desk. They were neither apologetic nor sensed the grossness of the situation. The front desk notified me that they would be sending someone. They sent one male janitor who came into the room to change the sheets. Again, no apology or anything. About 30 minutes later, still in my PJ's and about to get into the shower, the same male janitor knocked on my door. There had been no call from the front desk so I was wary of opening my door. I opened it and stood at the front door asking what he wanted. He claimed he left his master key inside my room. I told him I had not seen any key but he barged in the room and started searching for it himself. At this point, I was really uncomfortable. Our room was in the corner, I was by myself, and this strange man was basically looking through my stuff. Of course, he didn't find anything and left. I was late for an appointment and didn't stop by the front desk to tell what happened. I came back into the hotel in the late afternoon and asked to see the manager. When I told her of what happened, again, she wasn't very concerned, was condescending, and kept asking me what the big deal the situation was. She referred me to the housekeeping manager who sent me a small box of chocolates to ease the situation. We left the next day. Their valet policy is to call the front desk 30 minutes in advance and they will have the car waiting in the front. (I think the place where they park is actually pretty far and that's how long it takes to walk and drive back). We called it in the next morning at 6am. My flight was leaving at 8:30 so we were cutting it close. We came downstairs after the allotted time to find the wrong car sitting in the front. We informed the front desk that it was the wrong car and they had to call over to the valet deck. Instead of hurrying and trying to get our car back to the hotel, the front desk was more concerned with whose fault they got the number wrong. We didn't care as long as the car got to the hotel ASAP. It took them another 30 minutes to do so. The charge was $49 per night for valet, so my husband wanted to see if they could waiver the last night's valet charge for their mistakes. It has been horrible trying to talk to anyone. No manger has called back.

LOCATION The Sheraton's location is just ok - on Canal Street which is on the edge to Chinatown (we thought not so nice unfortunately!) but also quite close to the more \"in\" area of Tribeca and when you walk up Broadway you have nice, though expensive shops to look at and a very nice, clean and safe area when walking further uptown. We walked Broadway (uptown) as well as West Broadway (uptown) even at night and felt safe. However, we did not like walking in the other direction towards Chinatown, as we felt unsafe there - just our impression. But location was the only not so great thing about this hotel. ROOMS When we were checked in, we were given two rooms on the executive floor. The rooms were good in size, clean and not too loud - you did hear sirens and a car alarm every now and then but that happens everywhere in NYC! The Sheraton also has wonderful beds! Our rooms had a (for our standards) huge double bed with great clean sheets & more than enough fluffy pillows! This was great for us, since we had to stay in bed more than we had wanted to due to an illness. On our 3rd day I had to contact the front office re a doctor and was told by staff they have a doctor who makes house calls. They contacted him for us and he called us at our room later. He arrived in the early afternoon and was very nice and competent.

The lounge even has a wonderful terrace - too bad it was winter! There's also a computer in the lounge which you can use for free for a certain period of time each day (I think it was around an hour or less?), but there were also a couple of computers for free use in the lobby.

On our second visit to the hotel in January, we were promised, as now Platinum members, a Suite upgrade. Excited we went to check our room on the 5th floor and were immediately disappointed. The rooms was not much larger than their standard and the view was terrible. The small windows looked out at a brick wall. We then called the front desk, She told us there were no suites available, however we could have a room on the 17th floor with a better view. Of course we took it and it was a beauitiful view, directly across from the Empire State Bldg., but the room was standard, not an upgrade. Upon departure, we did not convey our displeasure due to the fact that they did change our room. However, when I returned home, I immediately contacted Sheraton. I received an apology from them as well as an email contact from the hotel itself with an apology and a promise to do better next time. I am not saying that I would not stay at this property again. It is convenient to visit the above-,mentioned areas for a short trip. We had reservations at Patricia's in Brooklyn which was a short taxi ride away.

Not exactly a major problem, but more of an oversight by the management. The hot water went out one morning. I called guest services and was advised that it was being repaired and would be back on in 20 minutes. sure enough it was on in 20 minutes and again more of an inconvenience than a disaster, but not what I'd expect from a Sheraton. The coffee shop was always empty which meant ordering was quick. The bar area seemed quite adequete for a quick drink and nothing more.

After cursing out the manager, he gave me points for the headache, but I swore I would never be returning again. Checking out took us almost 30 minutes. We almost missed our train to go home because of their \"computer\" delay. Around the holidays I had a friend from out of the country in town. I booked this hotel again because the rooms were only $99 per night and were in the area we needed to be in. A year had passed and I was hoping the hotel had got their $h*t together. Well, I was wrong. I am a SPG Platinum member and have been for years, but this hotel doesn't care. My card didn't go through because there was other hotel holds still on it from stays I had from earlier in the week. I told them I would pay cash (which I and my friend had a lot of) and I would leave cash or card deposit. Well, well, well they told me they can't do that. Excuse me? I have cash to give you as a deposit for incidentals. Remind you that I have over 50 stays a year, the rooms have mini bars and the front desk has the power to lock my movie rentals and phone. Still a no go. The manager said we have people who trash the room a lot. Really? I don't walk around thinking I deserve special treatment, but the entire point of being a elite member to something is for the \"special treatment\". I show my loyalty to a brand then I want the same loyalty back. Especially when your standing there with your bags during the holidays and just want to get into your room to relax and enjoy the little time your in town. My friend swiped his European card which it was denied as well and he didn't know why. I asked the hotel if it was their computer and they said no. Well, after an hour of what I like to call a big ol mess we ended up at the Le Meridan (which was only $60 more) and the manager said \"because I'm a platinum member and stayed here before\" he would take a cash deposit. My friend said could you try my card first, and they did.......which of course it went right through!!!! So there was no need for the cash deposit, but its nice to know that we could of used if we needed to. My friend loved the hotel so much that he booked the hotel for his conference in the spring time. This hotel isn't worth the headache. I never thought I would give a hotel one star especially a SPG hotel.

After two requests,I gave up.I never heard anything back not even a sorry we have no more.Nada.So I moved a shelf from under the desk to set my luggage on that.The bathroom you have to turn on a light because it's pitch black.Well with the light comes this horrible fan noise.There is another light that is not connected to the fan and it is in the shower.This light however does not give you enough light to put makeup on.So here I go moving furniture and now a lamp from the dark room into the dark bathroom so I can get ready in the morning.Sounds relaxing doesn't it? You can hear the people next to you so if you watch T.V. at night the sound has to be practically mute.Also the T.V. is fixed to the wall and it will not move at all so you cannot turn it in your direction.The thing that really was the most irritating is that you have an elevator key that you have to have each time you get in if you want your floor and if you forget your key well it's back down to the lobby to get a new one.When you check in they ask if you want your family members name on the record ,so,if your family member forgets the key your family member gets another.Well, so much for that. My family member was grilled when they went to get another key and they left the phone in the room and could not call me when I was in the club lounge to explain to me what happened. If there are alot of people in the elevator,each person has to pull out there key for there floor and it was hair-raising to try to get all the keys in and your button pressed before it passed your floor!This shows me that this is a sketchy neighborhood or they would not have this crazy key system.The Club Lounge is quite nice but this is extra $$.They have no heat lamps or anything cheery(even a fake flower would have been an improvement) out on the terrace.If you go outside on the terrace Club Lounge and take in the only reason to really stay here (the view of the Empire State building)You have to stand literally because the way they designed it if you sit down you stare at the wall.Not relaxing.At least there is a good pizza place around the corner Saluggi(sp?) I think. I suppose if you are on a higher floor and have a view of the Empire State Building and they did not make you pay for wi-fi per day, I might have enjoyed my two nights here.At least you could open your drapes and see your clothes to get dressed without having anyone look at you in your birthday suit from the building next door.On a positive note,great bedding one more negative beds are like xtra large twins.they do not seem to be even full/dble beds.The housecleaning lady left me a welcoming note in hopes of a gratuity I guess? When I went to check out I found that there was a charge of 2 five dollar waters.I think housecleaning must be responsible for telling the front desk this?I would have gladly given her the price of water before I would have drunk a bottle of water that was 5 bucks!The water was sitting there the whole time with the 5 dollar price on it.Then I had to spend time on reversing the charges.This was the nail in the coffin to a disappointing stay", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cDissapointing experience, not good value for money\u201d", "Author": "Harry833", "ReviewID": "UR123311029", "Content": "Only the service at the hotel met our expectations.

OK, so walking out onto Canal St can jolt anyone out of even the worst jet lag but all the fun streets like Mercer and Green St's in Tribeca and local cafe's, restaurants, wine bars, boutiques and people watching more than compensate for being hustled to buy some cheesy T Shirt on Canal St. Definitely worth checking out.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cbeat expectations\u201d", "Author": "mom2rk", "ReviewID": "UR123205052", "Content": "We booked this hotel thru priceline with the biddng process.

They happily stored our luggage for us and gave us an estimated time that a room would be ready. We went in search of lunch in the meantime and had a great meal in Chinatown. We wandered around, returning to the hotel at the estimated time. A room still wasn\u2019t available, but the front desk clerk quickly made some calls and found a room that would be ready in 10-15 minutes. Enough time to grab a beer at the hotel bar! They had a special going on some bottles, so it was reasonably priced for us (I think $3 or $4?). The lobby was very nice - computers to use, a full bar, Starbucks, and you can use their Wi-Fi for free in the lobby (for 45 min at a time). They let us know when the room was ready and got our bags for us. The room was small, but not too small. We had a king-bed room on the 10th floor. As others have noted, there\u2019s not a real closet, but they do have a wardrobe with some shelves to put your clothes and there are more shelves under the desk area. Only a shower, no tub, but that didn\u2019t bother us as we don\u2019t usually use hotel tubs anyway. The bed was extremely comfortable and the a/c worked great.

The last couple of days we didn\u2019t get any notes and the extra towels were gone w/o replacements. Oh well. Not a big deal, but the personal communications and accommodations were a nice touch.

Irene, the hurricane, was not invited but she came anyway. We drove our car to the hotel and were a little surprised that there wasn't a better entrance for guests arriving. You're lucky to get a spot on Canal Street to unload your car. Valet parking was $60/day. Upon arrival, I thought we'd be bombarded by bellmen who'd help us get unloaded, etc. but not so much. My husband ended up taking our car to a local garage that was INDOORS and ABOVE GROUND to make sure we'd be okay if the hurricane hit. It ended up taking him about 20 minutes to go around the block and I attribute this to the mad rush of commuters getting out of the city before the storm him. Still, kind of a pain to deal with. Otherwise, check in was smooth. We were in the club level as our reservation was booked with my Starwood points. The bellman who took us our to our room, was extremely knowledgable, full of information, and eager to give us a great experience. We were taken to our room on the 17th floor. Our room was beautiful and roomy for NYC standards. One wall was all windows looking right towards the the Empire State building. Fantastic views and the rooms are brand new and well designed. Because of the impending hurricane, many of the guests were basically stuck at the hotel since all of Tribeca shut down. So the bars was full, the computers were being used and there was a lot of activity in the lobby and restaurant. I have to give the staff a ton of credit. No one seemed annoyed by the questions, the stress or the influx of guests. They kept a bulletin board with storm updates in the lobby and a flyer on each floor. Overall, the hotel was fantastic at providing news on the storm, what roads were open, what their plan was, and what we could expect if we got hit hard. Fortunately, we only lost cable for a an hour or two. Power never went out. And I have to mention how comfortable the beds were. We slept so well during the height of the storm and the linens kept us warm and cozy. Upon checkout, right after the storm, we decided to hit the breakfast buffet to get some food in us before our drive home. If we could actually drive anywhere. The buffet left a lot to be desired. The eggs were old and cold, there was no more toast left and none of the staff seemed concerned that they were busier than usual and guests were in line waiting to eat. However, I have to say that the Sheraton staff managed the storm and its inconveniences really well. I loved that there was a Starbucks in the lobby to get some morning coffee. And the lobby was bustling with travelers who made it a communal meeting space. The staff accomodated.

As a devoted Starwood Preferred Guest, I'm pretty picky about my hotels. And this one definitely hit the mark. First off, it's just around the corner from the subway station that serves the A, C and E lines. That means if you flew into JFK, it drops you off almost at the front door for a whopping $7.25 with both the Air Train and Subway fares. Other subway lines are within a few blocks, so you can literally get anywhere in Manhattan very easily and for $2.25 a ride. Add to that, you're right across the street from SoHo, which has shopping and restaurants a-plenty - all very walkable. This is a busy hotel with a fairly small lobby area that made it feel even busier. But that was never an issue for me. I was still able to get an elevator rather easily. The lobby is modern and clean with lots of amenities - a grab-and-go food/drink counter, a small bar with seating area, a restaurant, and an area with several computers . I was lucky to get into a room on an upper floor, so the view was great. Furnishings are comfortable, including the bed. The bathroom isn't huge, but it's well-equipped with a nice stand-up shower and well-lit mirror. The one thing I thought was odd was there were no drawers for unpacking my suitcase. The closet had hangers, but nowhere to really put things that don't hang. Not a huge inconvenience. Staff was very friendly, efficient and helpful. The rooftop deck (which I believe is only accessible to Club floors - Splurge! It's worth it!) has INCREDIBLE 180 degree views of the city, as well as breakfast and evening snacks. This is highly unique for a New York hotel. Yes, so this hotel is directly on Canal Street, which is totally nasty and crowded. But as you walk out the front door, just head left and go around the corner to the parallel street behind Canal. It's quiet, safe, and no one is going to try to sell you a fake Rolex. That's what I did to get to the N, Q, R subway stop. And once you get off of Canal in any direction, your'e right back to charming, movie set-like, downtown New York. Comparing to what NYC hotels are charging these days for a nice, modern, new-ish room, I thought this hotel was a bargain - and I compare all Starwood properties before I make my decision (always check AAA rates and \"hotel offers\" on the SPG site before you book).

This is a very nice property but if the hotel can get away with charging you for something, they will. I stayed here in April for a college visit to NYU with my daughter and booked another reservation on August 29 for her move in at NYU. Unfortunately, I had to cancel the reservation because NYU shifted move-in schedules due to Hurricane Irene and it would no longer be feasible for me to check in to the hotel on the same day as the rescheduled move-in day. I called the hotel directly to cancel the reservation. For some reason, the hotel staff member did not provide a cancellation number--perhaps distracted due to--I don't know--maybe a myriad of guest cancellations due to the hurricane? Moreover, for some very strange reason--perhaps with so much on my mind between rearranging all of my travel schedules, being emotional over my first-born going away to college, and feverishly shopping for dorm items online while the city was shut down--I did not ask for a cancellation number for the first time in my life. Not only did the hotel charge me for the room and not retain a record of the room cancellation (don't they record conversations in the event of disputes like this?), they also insist that if I did not receive a cancellation number, then 1) the responsibility is mine to ask for one, and 2) if they don't have a record of it, it did not happen. Really?! Is it not possible that perhaps one of the hotel staff members got distracted and neglected to give me a cancellation number and record this important information? I have the phone record to prove that I called the hotel in advance of my stay and\u2013believe me, it was to cancel the room, not a request to fluff up my pillows! I had four phone conversations with the hotel to try to resolve this--first with Steven at the front desk, who promised I would receive a phone call from the general manager--a phone call I never received. When I called back, I spoke with Priscilla, she insisted she was \"the manager\" and insisted on resolving my problem, and then when I asked for the general manager, she instead referred me to Cornelio Encarnacio, the reservations manager. Fast-forward several days later, and a conversation with Cornelio that went nowhere. When I again asked to speak with the general manager, I was referred instead to the revenue manager. Um \u2013 me thinks the revenue manager would not be inclined to reverse charges if he is responsible for increasing revenue. Just a guess. Why were guarding the GM? It was not until I looked up the general manager's name online and asked for him by name that I finally spoke with GM Lowell Beebe-Center. Apparently, he had been spoon-feeding his staff the responses to me because he held the same position -- no record at the hotel means it did not happen. He refused to reverse the charge and assume any responsibility for the mistake his staff made. Lessons learned: 1) always ask for and record a cancellation number and, 2) apparently, the customer never wins at the Sheraton Tribeca. I have never encountered such unfriendly and unbending management and staff\u2014especially in light of the circumstances.

Every time I spoke to the customer service reps, they said if I cancelled the second night, I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep the discounted rate and it would result in a rate change of $100 more since it was less than 24 hours from the first check-in day. They weren\u2019t very sympathetic to the upcoming hurricane threat and weren\u2019t even willing to match the current online rate, which was about halfway between the 2 rates.

The hotel bar closed at about 1:30 AM, so that didn\u2019t really help our cause. I had to walk about 10 blocks just to find a convenience store that was open. The subway entrances for the 1 and A/C/E lines were both a couple minutes away, so that made it cheap and easy to navigate to various parts of the city. A final note about the Hurricane - The hotel had flyers at the front desk and elevator areas providing guests with an update of the hurricane on Friday. Even though the hotel wasn\u2019t in the mandatory evacuation zone, they took the time to give another update to every room late Friday night asking people to leave for their safety early Saturday morning if possible, but that they\u2019d remain open with limited services if they had nowhere else to go. This is evidence of the hotel\u2019s genuine care for their guests and quality management during an event that\u2019s very unusual for NYC.", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWe Loved It\u201d", "Author": "mandmshow", "ReviewID": "UR117255276", "Content": "What makes this hotel is the staff and the location.

Canal street gets very empty and walking from 2 of the train lines doesn't feel safe. The location is more like Chinatown/Tribeca/Soho. Canal street is a mess. However, Tribeca and Soho can be fun for shopping and restaurants. For site seeing (museums, UN, Theater, Rockefeller Center, Central Park etc) we spent a lot of time on trains and taxis. The hotel itself is just okay. The staff vary from the bellhops which were wonderful to the front desk which was rude and hopeless. We booked a suite and asked that they have the queen sofa bed made when we arrived. When we arrived I double checked and was told it was fine. It wasn't. On the 3rd night it was finally made. The suite is actually not a suite so much as a sizeable room with a king bed and queen sofabed. If I were to do it again, I would go back to the Lucerne or one of the hotels that has true suites. I should say the air conditioning here was great for a NYC summer, the room amenities were very good and that Sheraton bed is great (the sofabed was not). We are loyal SPG fans, but sometimes it pays to look elsewhere and this hotel is not worth the cost. Also the large groups staying there meant the noise from halls was a pain if you are trying to sleep. The lobby is packed all of the time. My one serious recommendation if you stay here.

We were in NYC to search for an apartment and so were pretty busy and stressed out. We wanted a place that was central to lower Manhattan while also an oasis from the city stress. As longtime SPG members we decided to try this new hotel. I reserved a club level king via SPG and was able to easily contact the hotel. We were having a few items shipped to us at the hotel and needed to coordinate with the desk. Everything arrived and was held for us! Check In: Check in could have been better. This property has been slammed with business since its opening with a host of difficulties that I hoped would have been smoothed out by the time we arrived. But when I walked in at 6pm to be told \"hang on while we find a room for you\" when I had a reservation booked for several weeks did not make me feel secure. It all worked out quickly and we were on our way up. Please note that the bellman didn't even offer to help us take our bags upstairs. Room: The room was small but quite well appointed. The bed was extremely comfortable, and even though we were near the elevators I had no problems with hallway noise or sleeping. Immediately upon check in engineering came up with our refrigerator (free, you just have to ask) and a \"Gym in a Bag\", which was a fabulous idea - mat, foam roller, exercise tubing, and a massager. The only thing we really missed in the room was a safe. There is only a safe at the front desk, not in the rooms. Club Lounge: The Club Lounge is lovely and the view from the deck is stunning. The concierges on duty were always pleasant and attentive. The Food & Beverage service, however, was lacking. Every afternoon we had the same food - samosas, some kind of sausage in pastry, fried artichokes, and various crudite. Breakfast was a bit better. The printer and fax didn't work in the Club Lounge, so anytime I needed to print or fax it was a trip down to the lobby. Room Service: We ordered room service on 3 nights, and it was consistently good food and service. Portions were HUGE! WIFI: Wifi sucked for the first day or two, but them smoothed out. Be aware that even if you have a \"Free Wifi\" Club Room you will need to check your bill for wifi charges. Checkout: Check out was pretty smooth, except for the previously mentioned wifi charges. We have 2 laptops, 2 blackberries, 2 kindles, and an ipad. Every single day we were charged for each device connected at $9.95 per device - that's $70 a day! Plus we had been charged for a phone call we didn't make (I never use hotel room phones; it's cheaper to pay roaming!).

The first time we got such a small room, that there was no space to move, unpack, or anything. Literally, this was the smallest room I have ever had in NY, including Four Point by Sheraton Chelsea... The reason we got such a small room as Starwood Platinum was that we checked in early, requested a quiet room and there were no better rooms, and to do room change in the afternoon the front desk made it soo complicated, that it did not work out. So if you do need to check in early, make sure you are getting the room you like, rather that bother with the room change later. It is better to drop your bags, and check in later when usually better selection of rooms is available. To be fair the agent who checked us in, did try to arrange to move us to a better room, but the new shift was less than forthcoming with the move. The following morning the agent confided she could not sleep for putting us in such a small room. Two subsequent times we were allocated a much larger room, and the experience was much much better. Those rooms had Canal St orientation, and window insulation was good, the noise did not bother the sleep, and a bonus was a fabulous view of midtown as well as over Soho. The hotel gives a complimentary access to Club lounge for Starwood Platinums. They do have some cheeses, appetizers in the evening and some not very impressive breakfast spread. Please see a picture of available drinks in the lounge. I find it strange that having invested in the lounge, nicely furnished it, hotel does not bother to take drinks out of their cartons before stocking the fridge... It is also worth mentioning that the lounge is connected to an open-air terrace with amazing views as well.

We decided to go with it as it seemed the Sheraton was endorsing it. We also made sure the driver knew ahead of time we were going to two different terminals. When we arrived at the first terminal and my friend was getting her baggage out the driver told us we owed him $65 for the ride to the airport and another $15 to go to another terminal. We told him we weren't paying him anything extra as we had already negotiated the price with the bellman. He told us he didn't care what the bellman said, we owed him more.

She then connected me to the front desk where I explained again what was happening and this woman got the bellman on the phone who requested to speak to the driver. I handed my cell phone to the driver and after a few minutes the driver hands me my phone back and tells me fine, I'll drive you to the next terminal and he was not happy about it. I didn't feel comfortable getting in his car so I said no thank you and took the airbus to my terminal. Again, I wouldn't NEVER have taken the car if the bellman hadn't reassured me over and over that it was a trustworthy service. If I didn't have the nerve to call the hotel or had been in a big hurry I would have had to pay the driver more.

The club level observation deck has a beautiful view and the continental breakfast exceeded our expectations. The room was clean, and while not exceptionally big, it was modern and had a great view. The shower was great and the water pressure was perfect. The Sheraton Tribeca is located on the border of Tribeca and Soho. There is lots of shopping to be had on Broadway, which is only 4 or so blocks away. Walking distance to Chinatown and Little Italy make for a nice visit as well. If you are a vegetarian, there is a place called 'Dojo' at 14 W 4th St(Btwn Bway & Mercer St). They have an excellent Soy Burger dinner with a soy burger patty, salad and brown rice for 5.25.. Thats right, only 5 bucks, unheard of for a dinner/lunch in Manhatten. Its a casual sit down place that also serves beer/ liquor. If you are looking to save money on your stay at the Sheraton Tribeca, there are some great options. If you need a quick snack, there is a cheap deli next door with everything from pizza, to sandwiches, subs and more. On the corner of W. Broadway and Canal there is a Bodega where you can buy beer to bring to your room if you dont want to spend crazy money on booze at the bars or club. If you have club-level access you can bring your drinks up to the 21st floor observation deck and enjoy the sights and sound of the city in style. If I had one complaint, it would be this. I booked my trip on Priceline.com and was supposed to get a Deluxe King room, with Club Level access. On check in there was no mention of the club access and when I tried to access the 21st floor for the club lounge I was denied entry and had to call down and explain to them my situation. They were happy to help, and looked up my reservation, and confirmed that I was indeed supposed to have that access, so Im not sure why it was missed in the first place. It caused some embarrassment, as I booked the room as a surprise for my girlfriends birthday and when the key card didnt work to the club lounge, the surprise was cut short and spoiled as we had to back to the room to call the front desk. Thats a small thing I guess overall, and my suggestion would be to make sure inadvance that they know you have club level access if you book through an outside source.

I go out to a show and dinner, and my credit card is rejected (with plenty available). They keep my license and tell me to go to the show...straighten it out later.

Call my parents to get a card number to pay the bill after the show...embarrassing! Of course the night was a disaster. Called my credit union the next AM, and they tell me the Sheraton charged...CHARGED my card an extra $400.00 IN CASE I ordered anything else. Now, if there are any attorneys out there, isn't charging my account without my authorization (and without telling me) a felony or at least fraud.

I had booked this hotel via our local travel agent (requesting a treble room, all endored on travel documents). On arrival we found that we had been booked a double! (Not the hotels fault, but Gold Medal). Rather than engage in the usual shoulder shrugging and 'it aint our fault' attitude that you get in some places, the duty staff, Zakiya McFayden and the day manager Steve Lamour made every effort to get us accomodated. Although they dont do trebles, Steve took us to several rooms that he felt may be suitable, eventually sorting us a very pleasant room that included a comfortable fold out couch. Not satisfied that we were getting the best from our accomodation and expectations Steve also gave us complimentary access to facilites that we hadnt booked. The hotel itself is set on Canal Street, a busy road near the Holland Tunnel which on occasion can get hectic with commuter traffic. We didnt find any issue with the traffic noise. After all, you ARE in one of the busiest cities in the World. You just have to turn on the air con if its too hot, and close the window! Our room was comfortable, well maintained, and had that clean smell you'd expect with daily visits by the cleaning staff. The usual room facilties (TV/tea & coffee, etc) were availble. The fold out couch was more than enough for me, and the hotel arranged extra bed linen/quilt. The hotel itself is well decorated and maintained. The staff are pleasant, accomodating, and refreshingly knowledgable about both Tribeca and New York in general. The food and drink prices are on a par with what you would get at any tourist city hotel anywhere in the world so I dont have any issues. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton Tribeca. As a base for exploring NYC we found it completely suitable for our needs. Set in quieter surrounds than any hotel near the mayhem that is Times Square. We had easy access to the subway/buses, or indeed a very pleasant walk up to Midtown along either Avenue of the Americas or 5th Avenue. The staff again need mentioning because they prevented this holiday turning into a disaster. They DIDNT need to provide complimentaries as it wasnt the hotels fault, but the fact that they did can only exemplify the very high standard od customer care & service......

There was only one other person in the restaurant, so I could not have anticipated what was about to occur. I was seated straight away, and the server took my order immediately which was great. He also brought my beverage to me without delay. I ordered an egg white omelet listed on the menu, so no special order. I was then asked if I wanted fruit or potatoes and I opted for the fruit. However, I then sat for over 15 minutes without my food arriving. I did not get told by the server that there was any particular issue or delay in the kitchen. As I was getting increasingly frustrated, given that the restaurant was dead and no one except myself had ordered any food during this entire time (the 1 other person's food arrived a few minutes after I sat down ... I have no idea how long he waited for his!), I got up from my seat and walked over to the host area and asked if he was the manager. He said yes, I told him what had happened, and he then said he would go back to the kitchen to inquire. Meanwhile, a few minutes after I returned to my seat, another server brought my omelette and it had potatoes instead of fruit on the plate. I then asked for an explanation regarding why the order took so long AND why I was being given potatoes when I ordered fruit instead. This server was not the one who had taken my order, so she looked surprised and said she would return with it fixed. I then waited several more minutes, and it arrived. The manager then returned to the table to give me the most lame explanation, he said that the kitchen supports several areas of the hotel (room service, some club, etc.) as if that was supposed to make me feel better. I then said that it was shocking that it took 20 minutes to get an omelette when there was only me and one other person in the restaurant, he then repeated his previous explanation that the kitchen supports more than just the main restaurant. I then suggested that maybe there is not enough staff to which he responded by saying there are 2 chefs and this is the right amount and lack of staff is not the explanation. He then said he would comp the meal (would have been shocked at this point if he had not done so). The further upset was that although the omelette and fruit were ok -- nothing to write home about! -- the toast was burned! As I left the restaurant, I told him that I left the burnt toast and that I would be going to write this up on Tripadvisor. This was very unfortunate because although the hotel is on a very busy street -- Canal -- it is priced relatively well and is new which makes for a reasonably comfortable and good value hotel in New York.

As far as customer service...during my stay I had no major problems with Sheraton Tribeca, but not following through with complete customer service for guests after their stay means no returning clients! After staying almost a week at Sheraton Tribeca I realized I left behind my trench coat in the closet of my hotel room. I called the next day and found out that it was missing, but no other guests were assigned to that room. And no one but the cleaning lady was in it (the other woman that cleaned the room earlier during my stay remembers seeing my trench coat). The only solution they would provide for me was to claim it on MY insurance. After refusing I spoke with the manager of housekeeping who had to report this situation to the front office manager. It has been over a month since my theft and I have yet to hear back from this manager, Steven LaMoore. Whenever I call to speak to him, I only get that he's in a meeting or he's not available and emails and messages are supposedly sent to him to contact me back. I am told that he is busy but not even a courtesy call to let me know that he is aware of my situation or even an email in response would be polite. Maybe if I take legal action and file for litigation I will be taken seriously. I feel disrespected to not even get any sort of response back from the ONLY manager that seems in charge of matters of this nature.

The shower fixture was designed in such a way as to require one to blast oneself with cold water before arriving at the required temp, and the bath towels were rough and nearly as skimpy as the hand towels. Also, the toiletries provided are sub par. To have your linens replaced you have to have read one of the many in-room memos posted about the room, which state that this is only done upon special request. Finally, as we were leaving we were asked by the bellhop when we wished to depart (we checked out several hours later and were storing our bags at the hotel), and offered car service. Inquiring as to how much this would be, we were told $54, which is ridiculous, considering that we were able to catch our own cab for $20. Also, the way in which we were asked seemed to imply that it was somehow standard procedure. To a visitor unfamiliar with the ease with which one might secure a cab to LGA, I can see where they might prey on their guests.For the price, and considering the amenities offered by comparable hotels (terry cloth robes, newspapers, free wireless) I would look elsewhere for a hotel with more character.

This is unfortunate, since the decor -- a kind of heavy modernist/wood retro thing -- would benefit from a bit softer atmosphere. The current low room rates ($250 is the least expensive rate offered on the hotel's web site) are tempting, but as I discovered, that rate will only get you an extremely small room that's barely big enough to accommodate the king-size bed, too small for two people to do anything other than sleep and jostle to get by each other while en route to the bathroom or the tiny armoire which is the hotel's version of a closet in that size of room. So I opted to upgrade to their \"studio suite\", which was nothing more than a normal sized room -- and for that was forced to pay over $500, a rate that could have gotten us into a dozen other far more comfortable and appealing hotels in Manhattan which don't feel like a chain hotel. Oddly Sheraton has put the \"studio suite\" on each floor not in a corner but in the middle of the main hallway right next to the Coke machine + ice machine, enabling one to hear hallway conversations through the relatively thin door. Once in the \"studio suite\", I discovered that the bathroom fan was so noisy, and triggered by the bathroom light, that it might awaken your companion if you visited the bathroom while he/she was sleeping, and that using the internet cost another $25 per day. The windows were double-glazed, but traffic noise was still noticeable. The overly active HVAC unit was too efficient, streaming out cool air if you wanted only to lower the temperature a degree or two, or hot air if you wanted just to slightly warm it up. But somehow that went along with the clunky room furniture, which was upholstered to look like it was designed to withstand annual conventions of professional wrestlers. This isn't a hotel with any subtlety. Its use of space and choice of decor is tolerable only for short stays by those who don't plan to do anything in their room except sleep.

As in previous reports we noticed the gap @ the bottom of the door allowing noise from the corridor. In all other respect the room was adequate. On the day of our departure we were annoyed when the Room Attendant woke us by knocking on the door @ 8.30 am Centrally located hotel, helpful staff especially those front of house, clean & brand new so well maintained at the moment.", "Date": "November 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Williamsport, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cIF YOU WANT TO GET CHARGED 3 TIMES FOR THE SAME NIGHT--STAY HERE.\u201d", "Author": "snapperb69", "ReviewID": "UR87504628", "Content": "I stayed ONE NIGHT at this hotel and had to make 28 phone calls to finalize my trip and for them to give me a confirmation number.

The hotel is new built but doesn't feel quite finished. The rooms are drafty, there is a big gap under all the doors which lets in all the noise from the corridors, and there is also lot of noise from Canal Street (windows not sound proof). We had to move rooms twice - the first room we stayed in had an extremely small window and felt more like a prison cell, the second one was so noisy that you couldn't sleep or think - the one we finally ended up in was quite but very small.
