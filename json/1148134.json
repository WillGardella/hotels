{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Fantastic villas with great staff. The Ranadi villas were absolutely fantastic. We stayed in the 2 bedroom villa over Christmas and New Year period. The villas were beautiful and clean. Breakfast was great and the staff were amazing. Even when my friend slipped in the bathroom and broke her leg the staff could not have been more helpful taking her to hospital/doctor appointments, making arrangements, sending her flowers. Thank you Ranadi Villas for making our stay so enjoyable. Would definitely stay again and would highly recommend to others.", "Date": "Jan 4, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR303982608", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "PebblesPerth"}, {"Content": "Such a pity Beautiful villa mainly because it was spanking brand new however such a pity that the level of service was so horrendous that it left me a bad taste in the mouth. Arrived at 10 a.m. in the morning and was glad to find out that the villa wasn't fully booked the previous night hence able to get a room immediately. Got the customary welcome drink but not the wet towel. Booked the villa 2 weeks in advance and was e-mailing with the staff to set up a in-villa dinner for me to propose to my GF.1st sign of trouble that I should had picked up was upon checked in, when I asked on the progress of the all important dinner the next night, the receptionist had no clue. She had to go back and checked with the office and only then, knew about the dinner arrangement. Naively thought that it was just an administrative oversight, I ran through the itinerary of the dinner plan to confirm and thinking that it would go without a hitch. Communicated clearly with the receptionist through English and Indonesian (my driver also translated for me), I thought everything would have gone according to what was agreed and discussed. She understood clearly the plan and told me everything will be taken care off.Asked her about the menu for the all-important dinner and she gave me their set dinner (trust me, there's only 2 choices - Indonesian or Western). Was dissappointed with the lack of selection and told her I will confirm with her in a couple of hours. Went to our villa via a golf buggy (quite a walk from the reception area). Villa was as shown on the website although smaller than what I'd expected but nevertheless, quite happy.When I'd flicked through the room service menu, I found out they had so much more choices that what was offered in the restaurant menu. Also available was an in-villa BBQ. Happy that they had the BBQ option, went to the reception to inform that I would like to have the BBQ option. Surprising, the receptionist didn't even know that it was an option available to guest. After showing them the room service menu, she had to go back to the office to confirm if it was available. By now, I should have known that trouble was brewing however decided to ignore it and naively though it was again an administrative oversight.When the big day came (the day I was going to propose to the GF), upon arriving at the villa after a full day's out, found out they screwed up on the surprise dinner when the villa was half set up (when I told them to only do it AFTER we left the villa for a sunset drink). A consolation would have been if it was fully set up (even if not according to schedule) so that my GF would have been surprised. Unfortunately, the surprised party was me since because it was only half set up, it was neither here nor there.So the surprise dinner was ruined and the proposal didn't really carry as much wow factor as I'd planned. When I spoke to the same receptionist about the screw up, she was more concern about laying the blame at her colleague (she said that she had communicated with them before) than to fix the problem. Her indifferent attitude really turned me off.Spoke to the GM the next day and all he did was apologise and didn't try to make it up.On another note, we stayed there for 2 days and on both days they screwed up our breakfast order i.e. what we ordered wasn't what we'd gotten. Wasn't really gonna harp on the issue but because of the monumental screw up at dinner, decided to post it here.Conclusion - beautiful villa (although lots of mosquitoes and bugs at night [that's why they had mosquito repellant in the villa although it was a futile solution] and [-] hot during the day), it was totally spoilt by the poorly trained staff. Granted, the other staffs were very gracious and polite. Will never ever come back nor will I recommend it to anyone else (unless you're only interested in the room and not the service).Be warned!!!", "Date": "Oct 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR606917495", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Blaquesmith"}, {"Content": "Wonderful villas       swimming pool", "Date": "Oct 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR228674489", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "soakota"}, {"Content": "nuovo e perfetto   showReview(19403327, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR118162476", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "fra24"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469404-d1148134-r23238550-Ranadi_Villa-Seminyak_Bali.html", "HotelID": "1148134", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
