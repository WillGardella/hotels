Not sure but If you bring your own computer maybe the Wii is free. Just FYI: It was no problem but fyi the rooms have very large old fashioned keys and have to be left at the front desk when you go out. Also each guest gets a box located in the office area which is secured with a key that you hold to act as a safe and all my stuff including excess Euros remained safe and sound. The Le Lavoisler is quaint in that it has been refurbished so that you feel that you are in a hotel from the period in which it was built. I love this type of atmosphere and enjoyed the common areas and rooms. Pros: Prior to our trip they answered any emailed questions promptly considering time difference. I had booked through the hotel a car service to pick us up when we arrived but we missed our connection and the hotel was the go between to get us picked up. Breakfast is lovely and was included with our room. It is continental meaning a basket of very fresh and tasty French bread and pastries, orange juice (my granddaughter swore it tasted fresh squeezed) , coffee, tea, yogurt, cereal, jams & jellies. We loved it and the man who does breakfast each morning is a sweetheart. It can be delivered to the room in 5 min. time or you can go to the little restaurant area on the bottom floor before 10:30 am. You also may order eggs & bacon for I think it was 2 Euros. All of the people covering the front desk were very helpful in telling us how to get to our planned destinations by subway and rail. They also helped us book tours. We had never been to Paris, it was my granddaughter and myself and the people manning the front desk were wonderful help to me. I really do appreciate their help!!!!!! We had a great time!!!! Hope we do get to come back for a stay. The area has plenty of restaurants close by - the Chinese restaurant next door is very good. Also there is a large full service market 1/2 block from hotel. The area is located close to the shopping area on Hausmann Boulevard. The shopping is wonderful - designers, boutiques, high-end chains. We are from the NYC area and we thought we had died and went to shoppers heaven. The hotel is close to the Metro #9 which is the St. Augustine stop. We were going to Note Dame and they advised us what Metro line to take because there was construction on the normal line. This is the kind of help you need from a hotel when you are a tourist. It was just great!!! Thank you for a wonderful time Le Lavoisler!!!!! Also we only spoke hello and goodbye, thank you, etc. but each person spoke English and in fact each French person we met went out of their way to help us understand them (almost all spoke English but we also used laughable sign language) and to get around in wonderful Paris.

I arrived at the hotel which was simple to find just around the corner from the metro and a few minutes walk from Madelaine/St Lazarre. It seemed small and quaint. I was given the juniour suite (room 100) off the main reception. It was large, with an odd extra room which at one time was an outdoor balcony now closed off and containing a small chaisse lounge chair-bed, table and scary portrait. No view...a wall but it was sound proofed. Large bathroom w/ marble floors and great towels/bathrobes w/ R&G soaps. Large comfy King Bed...two plasma tv's and ample closet space. It was dark (no natural light) but clean and surprisingly quiet at midnight. I slept well..in part because I knew I was lucky to have a room!

HOWEVER, the best thing about the hotel...Fabienne. The receptionist during the day. She was a pleasure to know. Very helpful...friendly and efficient. A wonderful smile for a weary and frustrated traveller. The hotel was flexible and efficient in helping with bookings, information and local knowledge. The room cleaning was prompt and efficient. The breakfast service too. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in the 8th but who is not looking for a boutique or impersonal stay. The rooms do not have minibars...and, the decor is not modern. But - it is clean and comfortable.

One possible suggestion to the staff would be to do a late afternoon fluffing of the room for your return. We later returned to the Lavoisier after the house rental in Bergerac. This time our room was a Deluxe Double room. For only 149 Euros per night (possibly a promotion) including the breakfast, you couldn't beat it! Another comfortable room choice at the hotel. I believe room #26...any in that \"tier\" going up would be nice Really , the only thing missing for us was some fresh fruit at breakfast. The buffet offered fresh breads and pastries, freshly squeezed juice, fruit cup (packaged), yogurt and cereal. They will happily scramble eggs for you. A little fresh fruit would be a welcome addition for the fitness conscious who have a long day of touring ahead. As always, try to remember to tip at the table even though the breakfast is included. Over all, this hotel is one that we would easily recommend to friends and family . If you want a super busy area with tons of cafes within a step or two,...head for the Latin Quarter. If nice strolls with pleasant walks to beautiful shops is a on your \"to do\" list ..this is your place. We're already planning our next trip and will stay at Le Lavoisier as we pass through Paris. Many thanks to the staff.

I would have liked to have an opportunity to review the hotel itself, but we will not get that chance. I booked a room via access from the hotel\u2019s own web site (later I found out that even though you access the hotel\u2019s official site, the booking process is transacted through a 3rd party). During the process I specified 3 adults, and they were listed by name. The summary of the booking indicates the following: 1 Superior Room, and 3 breakfasts included each day. The Superior Room specification says \u201c (1 double bed) \u2013 3 people maximum \u201d In the narrative it says, regarding the rooms, \u201c Some of them can accommodate three person adding and extra bed. \u201d In the comments section of the booking I noted that there were three people in our party and that we would need an additional bed. After executing the booking I sent a follow-up email to the hotel to note the need for a third bed. The response I received said \u201cwe do not have anymore extra beds available for this period as mentioned on our system reservation\u201d. Actually, the reservation confirmation says NOTHING about a 3rd bed not being available. The hotel\u2019s suggestion was for a Junior Suite Veranda room. It was offered at a rate reduced slightly from the public rate, but it was still 125 Euros more than the rate we had booked. Not quite a bait and switch situation, but it sure felt like it. I booked a room for my party of 3 at what we thought was a great rate of 145 Euros, only to find that the appropriate accommodation for us would actually cost 270 Euros. After some research this is what seems to be the case. IF a 3rd bed is available, the site will have a box to check indicating your preference for that option. If it is NOT available ( which apparently was the case in my booking ) there is no option box displayed on the page indicating that that option is unavailable, nor on the confirmation statement. Despite the fact that I specifically indicated 3 people in my party, and listed us by name, there is no mechanism in place to indicate that the customer\u2019s request cannot be accommodated. I was told the following in an email from the hotel, \u201cThe fact is that when you do a booking online, the page suggests the extra bed directly if it is available (see below the example), if it doesn't appear that means we do not have anymore extra beds available.\u201d This probably should be explained on the booking site. There is no indication on the booking site or in the confirmation statement that indicates that a 3rd bed is not available, despite listing 3 adults in the reservation request. How is one to know if they are not getting what they requested? Given our budget for the trip we were forced to cancel the reservation. I emailed the hotel and told them that we would have to cancel. There is a booking fee of 5.60 Euro listed on the site. It is charged to your credit card immediately following execution of the booking. Since the site was not clear on our accommodation, and the hotel could not provide the desired accommodation, I requested a waiver or refund of this fee. In another email I was told, \u201c the system you booked with doesn't belong to the hotel and we are unable to refund the booking fees. Their system is programmed this way and we are unable to change it as it doesn't belong to us. The extra beds are online only if they are available, and this is before entering the number of persons.\u201d Though not a large sum, it appears I am out 5.60 Euro. I accessed the booking via the hotel\u2019s web site. But, since the site is a 3rd party arrangement, the hotel has no responsibility to remedy my situation. The process stated above is very vague for the customer. How is one to know if a particular amenity is not available, in this case the 3rd bed? If I list 3 guests in the booking I would expect some indication that all three guests can or cannot be accommodated as requested. Had I not sent the hotel a follow-up email we would have arrived there to find an unsuitable situation. 3 adults cannot share one double bed. And having to buy a much more expensive room would have squeezed our budget dramatically. We would have been forced to look elsewhere for a hotel, wasting our vacation time rather than seeing the beautiful city. We were disappointed that we could not stay at the Hotel le Lavoisier Opera. Luckily this situation was found before stepping in to their lobby after a long day of traveling.", "Date": "May 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cNice little hotel\u201d", "Author": "PUO", "ReviewID": "UR24353400", "Content": "Been to Paris a number of times for business.

We ended up staying here because Hotel Mayfair my first choice was fully booked. Due to Paris Fashion Week and another motorshow, Lavoisier bumped their prices up even more than Hotel Mayfair but booked here anyway due to proximity to Tuileres and thought the price would be justified by the 4 star rating. It was a typical small Parisian establishment with a informal, relaxed feel in a good quiet location, round the corner from Madeleine church. Our check in was quick and efficient. The room itself was small for a 4 star, we were expecting an above average room size like Hotel Mayfair or Hotel Brighton (a 3 star). It was reasonably clean and decorated in a classic style with muted colours. (No danger of garish rooms here unless thats your cup of tea) but was starting to look a bit tatty with wear and tear. LCD TV with Sky news and CNN. Bathroom was compact, rubbish toiletries, no shower curtain. Our wardrobe doors didn't close and carpet was not replaced in the last refurb and starting to look a bit dirty, so lucky we bought slippers as they did not provide any, unlike other 4* hotels. Overall, room was disappointing for the price and 4 star rating. Service was ok and very low key, which suited us. Our main problem was with their wireless internet connection which we paid for a 24 hours pay as you connect card. The connection was very weak on the 4th floor and in the end we only got 2 hours and it went out of action for three days. Didn\u2019t get fixed so we asked for a refund for the connection card, but Lavoisier refused saying we could come back next time and use the card again....(!?). Anyway, if you are staying at the Lavoisier, drop me an email and I would be happy to send you the internet connection card as we will not be returning to Lavoisier.

The room on the 6th floor was tastfully decorated but rather small but as it a small boutique hotel i wasn't expecting a travel Inn size room. The next morning we went to breakfast and was looked after wonderfully by Nisha. Breakfast is a simple affair of Bread, pasties, yogurt, fresh squeezed organe and coffee. For and additional 4 Euro you could have eggs and bacon but the breakfast was substansial to fill us both up until well after lunch. During breakfast on the first day we mentioned to Nisha that we were on honeymoon (not with a view to get anything out of it!) We returned that evening to find a bottle of Champagne waiting for us from Nisha and the Hotel. After breakfast we approached the Receptionist to see if we could change room, as it was our honeymoon, she was more than accomodating and asked us to bring our bags to reception on our way out and she would have them transfered to the new room once it was prepared. The new room was lovely, still small but we expected this. During the rest of our stay we spoke alot to Fabienne the receptionist and found her to extremely helpful and pleasant. She recommended a lovely resturant nearby called Taste La Mode (i think) which was amazing. We had one of the best meals i have ever had!

There are 3 common areas in the lobby to sit and read the multi language newspapers they provide for free or have a drink at the honor bar and meet other guests. It is quite lovely. The staff from the concierge to Nishan who serves breakfast to the maids are incredibly friendly and helpful. We were here for 7 nights and had a junior suite facing the back of the hotel. There were two large French windows overlooking a quaint church steeple and a rather ugly modern building. However we chose this room for the extra room and because we wanted a quiet room. That it was\u2026..exceptionally quiet. One of the quietest hotel rooms I have ever had and I truly appreciated the quiet. We slept each night with the windows wide open and were not disturbed. The maid did show us other rooms as we spoke a great deal to her in French. By the way everyone at the hotel with the possible exception of the maids spoke exceptional English. The other rooms were much more charming than the junior suites which another reviewer pointed out although the suites had the larger bed (actually two beds pushed together with a barely perceptible crack between them). Breakfast was quite good and in relation to the cafes in the area I found it to be worth the money\u2026.14 euros for a baker\u2019s basket, fresh orange juice, unlimited coffee and tea, yogurt and cereals and 3 euros more for bacon and eggs. They will also give you extra croissants and pastries at no additional cost. The cafes nearby charged anywhere from about 6 euros and up for one cup of coffee (extra cups at about 3 euros a piece) one croissant and a cup of juice. So if you eat a large breakfast the hotel breakfast is worth it. We only went elsewhere because we wanted a change of pace since we were at the hotel for 7 nights. Most days we didn\u2019t eat again until dinner because we were so full. You are quite close to the Place St Augustin metro station and the metro in Paris is very comprehensive and easy to use. However we walked quite a bit\u2026..to the Arc,, Tour Eifel, Louvre, D\u2019orsay and left bank. These are far walks but great exercise and very interesting walks. The hotel is quite close to the Opera Garnier and Gallerie Lafayette. There are also several cafes nearby most of which we found to be relatively pricey and so so. The best of the lot was caf\u00e9 St Augustin which was pretty good, great French fries and we thought worth the money for what you got. We also had Won Ton Soup at the Asian restaurant next door and it was very good soup. Most other meals we ate out of the area using the Zagat guide as our source which was dead on.....[--]. As many other reviewers noted there is a Monoprix in the next block where you can buy water and sodas and other things at normal prices. There is no refrigerator in the room but you can get ice downstairs at no charge. The only criticism I have of this hotel is as other reviewers pointed out we found the mattress to be lumpy and not as comfortable as they should have been. The pillows were also fairly hard foam like pillows and when we asked there were no other pillows\u2026.ie feather or down. I would not say the bed was incredibly uncomfortable and we did get used to it and slept very well. We are relatively young however and I am not sure others who might be older of have bad backs, etc would be as adaptable to the beds as we were. We were scheduled to only stay here for 5 nights and then check into the Grand Hotel for 2 nights but rather than repack and move hotels we cancelled the Grand and stayed at Lavoisier for an additional 2 nights so obviously the beds were livable. However it would have been nice to look forward to a very comfy bed and pillows to sink into at night. I would most likely stay at this hotel again if I want to be in the 8th Androissment. After checking things out and walking around I think quiet parts of the 7th might be very appealing as well. Overall this is a very nice hotel for the money with a very friendly and helpful staff and perhaps they will improve on the bed situation in the future.", "Date": "December 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coastal South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cEverything We Expected and More\u201d", "Author": "carolinians", "ReviewID": "UR6031319", "Content": "Our first visit to Paris was made even better than we imagined by our decision to stay at Hotel Le Lavoisier. We have traveled extensively at quite luxurious levels to many other parts of Europe and elsewhere in the world, even eastern France, but somehow had not been able to get to to this historic and beautiful city before. We have very high standards and expectations, but decided on this trip to avoid the luxury hotels and seek a more intimate and hopefully still attractive, friendly, and comfortable BOUTIQUE STYLE LODGING for this trip. This rennovated and updated townhome once owned by the French scientist Lavoisier was a WONDERFUL FIND. On our arrival and every day thereafter we were greeted warmly by the gracioius staff who made us (and every other guest that we observed arrive or depart during our stay) feel that we were who they had been waiting for. As a couple who hates (in spite of our preparatory research) to have every minute scheduled before they arrive and who like to make it up as we go along, the hotel's CONCIERGE SERVICES, especially Fabienne and Ludovic, were really the proverbial\" icing on our cake,\" providing us with EXCELLENT advice and service in every category you can imagine. They enjoyed my attempts to communicate in rusty basic French, and warmly responded in perfect English (& for other nationalities in a mutually understood language). They arranged for all our delightful dining experiences, willingly reviewed and culled our well researched list with us and even added some wonderful ideas of their own, which turned out to be excellent. They helped us to find the most convenient and (where requested) cost effective ways to see and experience as much of their fabulous city as possible in the week we had there. Whatever level of service we requested, they found a source for us and the quality was always excellent and did not disappoint. We especially enjoyed our outing to Versailles arranged by the hotel. We traveled by minivan in the company of three other English speaking couples from Canada and Australia with a young Frenchman as our driver and professional guide. His knowledge and ability to share it were \"incroyable!\" Every morning NIsha greeted us in Lavoisier's cheerful, cozy lower level cafe with his freshly brewed coffee in our own little pot and our own baker's basket of many fresh breads. The hotel offered this and more daily at the CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST buffet (INCLUDED in the price of the room) with more selections than one would expect in a small boutique hotel. (For those who choose to go elsewhere and want a full breakfast, numerous cafes are just steps away in any direction.) One evening we sat and enjoyed cocktails in the relaxing and elegant self-serve, HONOR BAR tucked just off the lobby with another couple staying at the hotel. It was then we planned our cocktail hour outing with them to the Ritz Bar toward the end of our stay. The LOCATION of this CHIC hotel is terrific, too, just a few minutes walk north of the Place de La Concorde, with the Champs Elysee in one direction and the Tuileries and Louvre in the other, just a few minutes from one of the \"hop on/hop off\" tour bus companies main stops, and just south of Hausmann and a taxi stand, the metro, Rue Faubourg, the Opera Garnier and the French department stores. Each day after roaming the streets, museums, historic sights, gardens,shops and restaurants, we returned to the comfort of our spotlessly CLEAN room with its SOPHISTICATED DECOR, COMFORTABLE BED with plump, soft pillows and lovely, up to date MARBLE BATH. We had asked when making reservations to be on the quieter side of the building away from the street and our request was honored without hesitation. The hotel is located just off Malsherbe and a bit north of the Madeleine Church in an area that is fairly quiet in the evenings anyway. It was nice to have the choice to enjoy the two grand French door style windows open or closed, when we needed the air conditioning system on a couple of warm September nights. No doubt, Hotel Le Lavoisier for $199 Euros per night was a major reason we enjoyed our wonderful visit to Paris. Since you cannot do Paris in one week, we must return to explore some more.

The bathrooms were excellent, all white marble and tiles, and again, very clean.

In short, Hotel le Lavoisier and its staff contributed towards an outstanding and memorable holiday.", "Date": "June 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, but skip breakfast!\u201d", "Author": "survivorfan", "ReviewID": "UR5226120", "Content": "We stayed at the Le Lavoisier in May 2006 and thought it was extraordinarily clean and had a unique contemporary, sophisticated style. We thought the front desk staff was helpful in making suggestions, giving directions, etc. However, the way that the menu in the breakfast room is written, it looks like the breakfast is included and that just eggs and bacon are extra. The reason why I say this is because there are no prices anywhere for the normal breakfast...but there are prices to add eggs and bacon. So...we ended up paying 14 euros EACH for two adults for each of two days, plus a fee each day for the child when she took two bites. In other words, we thought that the crossiants and coffee were included but about 72 euros showed up on our bill for crossiants that we thought were included. What an assumption on my part! I assumed that since there were no prices listed for anything except eggs and bacon, that everything else was complimentary. The room was extremely crowded with the cot for a triple room. You'd think a triple room would be bigger than a double, but hey...that's Europe. I also had espected a shower curtain, but this was not the case either. We sat in the tub and sprayed ourselves (and the rest of the small bathroom). I probably should have asked for one, but I didn't want to typify the preconceived notions of Americans. I, however, was impressed with the cleanliness and front desk service. The hotel was located in a convenient location to get to all the sights and right around the corner from a metro station. As far as cost, it was high at 204 euros per night, but we went in the peak season when rates in Europe are usually double, so most everything else in the vicinity was high priced also. The beds were the best part because they were actually quite comfortable! Overall, a good deal (with the exception of the breakfast) and very clean.", "Date": "May 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prague, Czech Republic", "Title": "\u201cexcellent\u201d", "Author": "jur", "ReviewID": "UR5008965", "Content": "I would definitely recommend Le Lavoisier.

The suites were perfect for families with small children because you can put the kids in an adjoining room. The regular room was a little small especially with the extra bed. The staff was really great. The best experience I have had in Paris (and we have stayed in a dozen hotels or more). They managed to find great restaurants for our very mixed group of 11 (Bouef sur le Toit particularly) and they were terrific with the kids.
