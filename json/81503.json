The rooms were comfortable, we had two double beds, alarm clock, a bathroom with a tub, a mini kitchen area which consisted of a sink, coffee maker + coffee packets, microwave, and a mini bar fridge.You can book transportation to the airport at the front desk with a couple days notice. The front desk clerks with very friendly and willing to provide you with any information you needed to know. Jay was a really friendly guy. This motel was in walking distance to the piers, it wasn't a short 5 minute walk but it wasn't too extreme. Probably a 20 minute walk. There are buses close by that will take you to the downtown area and the piers as well. A taxi to pier 39 was between $10 and $15.It's located close to a little restaurant called Marina's pizza which is worth checking out.It was probably a 15 minute walk up to the crookedest street. It was a difficult walk as the last two or three blocks was straight uphill. The front desk told us that there were no buses that could take you there but once we got to the bottom of the street we noticed that there was public transportation. I would recommed finding your way to the bottom and taking the staircase to the top of the street.", "Date": "Jan 8, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR874115378", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "sweetdreams0703"}, {"Content": "Wonderful experience!! Good location and good price. We stayed at the Travelodge Golden Gate Dec. 3-8th, 2008. I was traveling with my two grown kids and my son's girlfriend. The location was safe and close to many things. We hopped the Muni around the corner to go anywhere in the city. (Get a MUNI pass and schedule and you can go anywhere). Chestnut street around the corner is full of shops, good eating places, coffee shops, donuts, Johnny Rockets, Italian Deli, Walgreen for anything you need. We ate at Mel's Diner on Lombard (wonderful homemade chicken soup and sandwiches) and the Homeplate serves dinomite breakfast! The hotel served our needs as a comfortable convenient, clean and safe place to stay. The linens were clean and the service was great. We even had free parking for the one day we rented a car. The room near the street is a bit noisy but we had the fan on as the temperature was warm and we slept very well. We were not bothered by any other sounds and the hotel was full on Saturday night. I would stay here again for the price, cleanliness, location. We were very satisfied! Recommended!!!

Initially, I was mildly optimistic that we would have a good stay here. However, I left feeling disappointed and a bit cranky after three nights of broken sleep.The Good:1.) Good location. Easy to find, within walking distance of an IHOP, near some nice shops, pubs, and eateries (just walk one block north to Chestnut St.), near the Palace of Fine Arts/the Exploratorium. 2.) Fairly up-to-date decor with some amenities (TV, microwave).3.) Includes parking. (Parking can be hard to find/expensive in San Francisco.)4.) Friendly staff.5.) Reasonable price, when taking into account the going rate for accommodations in San Francisco. The Bad:1.) The noise. The walls are thin. You will hear traffic from Lombard Street all night long, which earplugs may help block out. However, my earplugs were not able to block out the loud men in a room next to ours who shouted and guffawed from midnight to 2:30 am one night, nor the people who decided it would be fun to repeatedly pound on the walls of their room at midnight another night. Being a courtyard-style motel, and within walking distance of pubs, you will hear people coming and going into the early hours of the night, banging the heavy outside doors to their rooms. I am usually a sound sleeper, but all this noise was enough to break up my sleep and keep me awake for long stretches. 2.) Uncomfortable beds and pillows. I found the beds too soft and lacking in support, which is typical of motels, and which might not have bothered me so much if I wasn't lying awake because of the noise. 3.) Even though this is a non-smoking property, someone in a room near ours lit up a few times, and the smoke quickly infiltrated our room each time. 4.) The parking seemed to be on a first-come, first-served basis. Although we always had a spot, there didn't seem to be enough spots to go around for everybody. Also, the stalls are narrow, so you will have to jockey your vehicle back and forth to fit. 5.) While the room seemed to be clean, for the most part, the shower curtain needed replacing as it was mildewy. The exterior of the building definitely needs sprucing up. 6.) Even though the staff is friendly, they were not willing to compensate us in any way for the three nights of broken sleep. They also do not seem to project an authoritative enough demeanor, hence I think many of their clients realize they can get away with disrespectful behaviour (noise late at night, smoking in rooms, etc.). Despite this motel's good points, I wouldn't stay here again. When you only have a few days to explore the city, you need a good night's sleep to make the most of your days.

My girlfriend and I have just got back from a month in the States, 9 days of which were spent in San Fran. We stayed at the Golden Gate Travelodge for this entire time. Although it does not look much from the outside, the rooms are clean and of an ample size. However, during our stay the tragic bombings in London took place. My girlfriend and i wanted to know everyone at home were safe, so we rang around from the hotel phone. The next morning we were phoned in our room by the owners of the hotel to say we had a telephone bill for $150, and could we settle up immediately. It is not necessarily the amount of the bill that annoyed us, it was the fact the owners clearly did not trust us. There were a few more incidents where the owners (namely the wife) were not very helpful which slightly marred our trip. Having said all of this, it was clean and is in a good location, I just do not think I will be staying there again.", "Date": "Jul 17, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR508436985", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Great location/price I just finished spending 4 great days in San Francisco and the Golden Gate Travelodge was just what I was looking for in terms of lodging.
