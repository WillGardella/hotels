Since it was the winter, the idea of a cold shower was not appealing. The front desk guy was inconsiderate and would not help. I didn't mind the small room, narrow flight of steps getting to the room, etc. What really mattered was that there was no hot water. Due to this fact and the front desk's lack of support, I would not recommend anyone else staying here. I know for sure I will never stay here again.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Biel, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cTrip to London\u201d", "Author": "RiccoS4", "ReviewID": "UR115588449", "Content": "Staff was Frendly top position cleanliness inadequate breakfast modest the toilet in the hallway deficient", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cStaff is friendly but toilets could be better\u201d", "Author": "Chris123Melbourne", "ReviewID": "UR93805665", "Content": "We had two rooms right at the top floor. It was a climb with bags and all. The rooms were acceptably clean and we had clean towers everyday. The shared bathroom/toilet arrangement is not good, some guests are less considerate than others, which means sometimes you have the entire bathroom floor wet and blocked toilets. The walls are thin, which means you can hear your neighbours. Breakfast was the worse we had in any B&B in the UK, terrible croissont and no hot breakfast at all, just plain cereals and toast. They ran out of hot choc on our second day there and was never back on the menu for the rest of our stay. Not worth the price we had to pay, but the staff were friendly.", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "wigan", "Title": "\u201cdo not stay here its for your own health\u201d", "Author": "audramayjune2010", "ReviewID": "UR66254464", "Content": "i have not got a good thing to say about this place,i arrived with my friend at 8;30 saturday 29th may ,when we got there our room was unavailable so we had to go in a single room.there wasnt enough room for one let alone two however we were given a refund of ten pound between us ,should have spent that on bleach to clean the room especially the toilet i,it was disgusting .we were told we would get a new room in the morning .as we werent ready when the cleaner came reception had the cheek to complain to us about still being in the room,although our new room wouldnt be ready for three hours and a half hours.we were pleasantly surprise with the size of the new room but that soon turned into horror as i awoke with bite marks .luckily i had only one night left there .when i returned that evening my friend made a cup of tea the first cup was chipped and had a ,big crack in it,so we decided to to take it in turns .it was full of scum .the very next day i awoke with more bite marks(must have only liked me my friend didnt get bitten).we got ready quicky as i couldnt spend anymore time there, we took our suitcases to the train station so we didnt have to go back to the hotel .it didnt matter how much it cost for the luggage i couldnt go back there .since returning home i cant stop feeling sick or dirty .here is a list of things we found wrong with it (hope you have a strong stomach) dirty toilet ,cold shower,dirty sheets and blankets,broken shower attachment,pubic hair on bathroom floor and i urge you not to go there i would sleep on a park bench first audra from wigan.ps never tried breakfast wasnt brave enough.", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgium", "Title": "\u201cBED BUGS!!!!

Myself and a friend had booked to stay with them for 2 nights but after one night of complete hell we left. We booked a double ensuite room, when we arrived we were shown to a family room with shared facilities. The room was a disgrace, there was a double bed and 2 singles squashed into the room with hardly any room to move. We couldn't even fit a small suitcase on the floor. It had dirty thin curtains that were stapled to the window with a gap big enough for people to see in our room. The sink was falling off the wall and there was no storage space. The shower and toilet facilities were dirty and in need of repair. The rooms are within close promximity of one another and we had noisy neighbours (not the hotels fault we understand). We woke the next morning got our belongings together and went to reception at 7.00am to complain and request a refund in order for us to move to another hotel. We were met at reception with rude comments from the staff and told to wait an hour and half for the manager to arrive to deal with the problem. We went to breakfast and didn't get anything better. Mouldy bread and smelly milk!! We left without eating or drinking anything and waited in reception. When the manager arrived at 8.30 he did not wish to listen to our explainations and barked that we would be moved to another room but would have to wait until 2 o'clock. We were going to the theatre on the other side of London and the show started at 3. We said this was unfair and asked if the cleaner would clean a room that was vacated so we could sort ourselves out. After basically being told to get lost we demanded a refund and expressed how unhappy we were and wanted to leave. The manager after shouting at us and calling us liars eventually gave us a refund. Please don't book with this hotel. I can't express enough how much it could have ruined our visit to London. We managed to find a hotel just around the corner and were able to check in at 9.30. The Edward House Hotel is a 5 minute walk from Victoria Coach and Train stations. We checked in and were offered breakfast even though the kitchen was due to close. The manager was super friendly and very accomodating. The rooms although basic were very spacious and comfortable. One of the best beds i've ever slept on in a budget hotel. Tea and coffee making facilities within the room and a fantastic ensuite shower room with wc and sink. I would recommend if your not fussy on a fancy hotel and want something affordable, basic and with a brilliant location go with Edward House Hotel.", "Date": "October 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cOlympic Hotel Disqualified\u201d", "Author": "sergi17", "ReviewID": "UR21991624", "Content": "I believe there are two Olympic hotels in London. Whatever you do, don't book this hotel. It was one of the most disqusting hotels that I have ever stayed at. After spending a great weekend at the Jurys Inn hotel in Ireland, we came back to this dump. The room was \"NOT\" clean, and that was only the beginning. Outside our window was debris from some construcion project that was taking place from one of three building. The first night I didn't sleep as I felt that I had bugs crawling all over myself. I didn't, but that's how dirty the room felt. Now for the real dirt. The bathrooms(not in your room, but of the community nature) were down right disqusting. There is no way that these bathrooms would be open in the United States. To make it quick and painful, the bathroom was very small, with a shower curtain that had been placed in the bathroom in the early 40's. The shower ceiling was totally covered in dark Black mold. And I do mean totally covered with Mold. We never ate the breakfast for fear of food posioning. In closing I would strongly suggest no one stay at this hotel. totally disappointed from Upstate New York.", "Date": "November 19, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Olympic Hotel Victoria", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d1176871-Reviews-Olympic_Hotel_Victoria-London_England.html", "Price": "$97 - $681*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">115 Warwick Way</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">SW1V 4HT</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514276", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/20/75/e8/reception.jpg"}}
