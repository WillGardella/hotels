My only complaint about the room is that the bed wasn\u2019t as comfortable as some other Best Westerns that I have stayed at. The mattress seemed a little bit old. The service at the front desk is excellent. I would recommend reservations because this seems to be a popular hotel. It was sold out when I stayed here. This is a very nice hotel.

I had to fly into Vegas for a quick business trip. I wasn't going to be in town long and didn't want to be on the strip so I looked for something close to the airport and found a great rate for this location. The reservation person informed me that the hotel offered a courtesy shuttle from the airport and to just give the hotel a call when my flight arrived. I had planned on renting a car but decided that if there was a shuttle service i could save some cash using that instead. When I arrived at the airport I called the hotel for the shuttle and was directed to the pickup location. After a short wait the hotel shuttle arrived and I was on my way. When I arrived i was greeted warmly and found fresh made cookies available in the lobby. I checked in and was directed to my room. My room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. Being so close to the airport you had some noise but after a while I didn't even notice the airport noise. I noticed there were earplugs in the room for those sensitive to the noise but I didn't need them and still slept well. Breakfast was more then decent in the morning and soon after I was on the shuttle heading back to the airport. I would definitely stay again if i had the chance. The hotel was perfect for my needs and the staff were all wonderful. If you can handle being near the airport this is a great place to stay.", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anaheim, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "jander07", "ReviewID": "UR128468222", "Content": "Adequate room, Fresh, crisp linen, Pillows were lovely, Location was right on the spot, Free shuttle to and from the airport including the strip although not available 24 hours.

We really liked the hotel. They had a free shuttle to the airport and (I think) to the strip. This is a three story hotel with an elevator. Be sure to ask for a quiet room far from the breakfast area if you are not an early riser!! Breakfast starts at 6. There are about 7 tables, so it can be noisy. There are rooms right beside the breakfast area. In all the rooms they give you earplugs to use, which is a really nice touch, even though we certainly did not need them. We were as far as we could be from the noise. The room was a good size with a king bed, an executive style desk and chair and it had the wash basin outside the tub/toilet room. The bed was very comfortable. Our only problem was with the pillows. There were lots of them, but they were all super thick!! We had sore necks by morning. Yes, we no doubt could have exchanged them for thinner ones at the front desk. By the time we noticed, it was late and we just couldn't be bothered. So I won't be holding it against the hotel. The breakfast was really good! There were three types of cereal, yogurt, make your own waffles, hard boiled eggs, bagels, English muffins, toast, muffins, danishes, donuts, hot chocolate, tea, coffee, instant oatmeal and even sliced almonds and raisins for you to add to your food!! Nice touch!! There was an outdoor pool, but unfortunately no exercise room. Had they had a gym, I would have rated this place as excellent!! They had fresh fruit (apples and oranges) available all day long in the reception area, which we really appreciated. We would gladly stay here again if we needed a place before/after a flight. It even would be a good spot to stay if you had a rental car and you were able to get a good rate at the hotel. We would definitely recommend this place.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cAdequate for one night's stay\u201d", "Author": "hhkiwi", "ReviewID": "UR128300480", "Content": "I booked a room at the hotel for one night because I needed to be near the airport to pick up my husband the next morning and I was arriving late that evening from Bryce Canyon. I was expecting the place to be similar to the BW in Bryce Canyon (what a great BW!), but I was disappointed. The staff just did a perfunctory job of checking me in (no smile or additional info about hotel's facilities) and the female staff directed me to the wrong part of the hotel to find my room. My room was right next to the breakfast area, and though the halls were quiet in the afternoon/evening, I heard lots of noise the next morning during breakfast time. The room was a mix of old and new. The beds and TV looked modern, but the bathroom and the surrounding area looked tired. The sink was actually right next to the room door and it was a bit inconvenient. I wanted to swim too but once I got outside and looked at the pool, I decided against it. The pool had a layer of film on it and there were leaves and other very visible particles I didn't want to wade through. The breakfast next morning was adequate.

Pros: The location is close to the strip (about a mile), so it's relatively close to things, and there is a free shuttle to the strip. The breakfast in the morning is continential, but the make it yourself waffles are really good. Cons: The shuttle only goes to the Tropicana on the South end of the strip. It was good for the first day, but then after you walk to the strip all day, you are not close to this pick up point anymore, so you will probably wind up getting a taxi back. Then if you walk to strip the next day, you most probably want to start where you left off the day before, which means you won't take the free shuttle. There is a monorail on the strip that we didtn't wind up taking, but I heard it's only around $7 for 24 hours after you buy the ticket. Maybe this would have made things easier if we used it, but we just got a taxi. Just to say you may need to add some travel cost if you stay here. Also you may read many review about the airplanes. It's both true that you can definetly hear them, and also that they are not a problem. By the time you get back from being out all day, it's no big deal, and the AC drowns them out anyway. Just think if you heard a plane pass where you are right now in the distance. Would it stop you from sleeping...probably not.

However, the airport shuttle apparently stops running at 11pm, so we had to get a cab (only about $10, so no big deal).

If your looking for basic hotel accomodations, away from the strip this hotel is perfect Rooms are very comnfortable, rates are great. and the hotel offers a complimentary breakfast, The front desk staff is very courteous and caring. I recall two front desk agents, that were very nice and caring during my stay. The morning agent, I don't recall her name, and the PM Agent, Candice, were very nice and accomodating. I would return, for caring people like them, who represent the company well, with their hardwork, and dedication to their guests. On the other hand, during my stay, I experienced several delayed shuttles, which made this stay somewhat difficult. Upon arriving to the airport, it took, several calls, before the shuttle driver came. In total I waited over 40 minutes, for a courtesy shuttle, that comes every 30 minutes. I was told by the driver, trafffic was bad, however the airport is 5 minutes away from the hotel. That same, night, I had to go back to the airport, and experienced the same senario, with a extremely delayed shuttle, despite calling the hotel several times. On my last day, I requested the shuttle from the Tropicana hotel, which again, came late, by about 30 minutes after the schduled pickup time. I'm sure traffic and weather delays affect arrivial time with the shuttle, however, to wait this long several times, for a courtey shuttle, thats operates close to the airport and strip, sounds odd. I definitly think, work needs to be done to correct arrival time for the shutte. As the saying goes, once is a experience, twice is a problem, three times is a trend.

Then at 5:00 to approximately 5:45 am a garbage truck was emptying the dumpsters out back and there was a bus parked in the way which meant the truck driver had to do some fancy manuvering to get to the dumpsters. Each time he backed up, the reverse \"beep-beep-beep\" was engaged so needless to say I was awake very early that day. I should have know there would be noise problems when we entered the room and there were earplugs provided on the nightstand. It is very close to the airport so you do hear plane/jet noise as well. The breakfast area is very, very small and the quality of food/coffee provided was not very good. I would recommend this place only if you have to.

Let me tell you, when you are at your lowest, you find out who is there for you and who is not. The guy I was going to see, completely stood me up too, didn't find that out till I got there. When I got to the hotel, I realized that I forgot to put my money on my bank card and so the hotel wanted the entire money for the stay and $100 on top of that in cash, in which I didn't have because my money at home. After back and forth with the receptionist, the Manager stepped in and had an attitude at first but I firmly let him know that I'm stuck and was trying to get touch with someone. He worked something out that night so that I had somewhere to sleep, and said that if I had a certain amount by check out tommorrow morning I could keep my room for the next night and to see if I could get in contact with someone. Well I thought I had help but by noon that next day, I found out I was lied to by a friend. I had to check out and the same Manager allowed me to hang out in the lobby and go view Vegas while I was trying to change my flight to go home that day or get the money. They also allowed me to keep my luggage in their office to help me. The flights were all booked and I still had no help, it was 4pm and I had no where to stay or sleep. A random person who I cannot name heard my circumstance and gave me $20. Then one friend back at home said she could pay with her credit card, so the Manager figured out a way to get her information to pay for my room that 2nd night so I could go home the next day. I know this review is long but the Manager or stand in Manager at this hotel was amazing at really trying to help me with my circumstance. The rooms were great and comfortable and clean. The shuttle only goes till 11pm that picks u up to and from the Vegas Strip, it also takes you to and from the airport.

The website of the hotel represents the hotel more accurately than most; it is a clean, good value place with a free airport shuttle. The site is close to the runway, but we heard no aircraft noise whilst inside the hotel, even though you can see a line of inbound planes as you stand in the car park. Check in was easy enough, there were two receptionists behind the desk. One of them was a little too chauvinistic to other employees and some of the other guests, but it didn\u2019t stop him from checking us in efficiently. The rooms have no safes and so I asked to use the safe deposit box at reception. This was not as easy as checking in, but we got there after going through the long list of conditions and penalties associated with the safe deposit box. There were a number of vending machines around the place, but all of the ones on the ground floor had \u2018out of order\u2019 signs on them. We asked for the nearest restaurants for dinner and were directed a mile up the road towards the German Beer cellar. We walked there, but decided to get a cab back; the hotel is not surrounded by roads which are frequented by pedestrians. The bathroom was really clean and had the usual Best Western toiletries. The bed allowed us to sleep for several hours undisturbed ready for a six hour drive the following morning. One surprising observation was the state of the sheets. They were spotlessly clean, but were not pressed, and so looked as though the previous guest had only just left the room. It wasn\u2019t so, but they looked odd. The included breakfast was a bit of a scrum both to get the food and then to get a table, but no one was too aggressive and the lady looking after the buffet worked very hard to keep on top of things, most commonly sorting out the waffle machine after unsupervised kids had not followed the instructions. Check out and the return of our safe deposit box contents were really easy and we got a lift in the shuttle bus to the car hire place. Overall as an airport hotel, it\u2019s a good economical choice, but it is never an alternative for a Strip hotel.", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cpleasurable stay\u201d", "Author": "rhenders", "ReviewID": "UR77847521", "Content": "I stay at this hotel everyday monday-friday..Always works out for me staff in very kind.", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monte-Carlo, Monaco", "Title": "\u201cunless you have to be at the las vegas airport and use their shuttle, take a \"real\" las vegas hotel\u201d", "Author": "Kortenbergtraveler", "ReviewID": "UR77727682", "Content": "well yes this best western is close to the airport in las vegas, and has a shuttle to it, and has the typical buffet breakfast with plastic tableware, and the rooms are big and clean and with comfortable beds, but that's it ... why would you stay here unless you need to be early or late at the airport ? why did i book here i still wonder .... yes, there is a kind of swimming pool, the size of two parking spaces; why do i compare with parking spaces ? well, the swimming pool is on the parking lot ... my advice, take a hotel in \"new\" vegas, or better, downtown", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Staff and Great Value!\u201d", "Author": "JulieK34", "ReviewID": "UR77582719", "Content": "I have to say I am pleasantly surprised by my stay at this hotel.

So this year we needed again a hotel near the Las Vegas airport for 1 night and so we booked 2 rooms at the bestwestern.com website. We could book the senior rate for the 2 rooms and I must say, it was very, very cheap. Prices were going down in Las Vegas (crisis??) and it was a bargain. I received my reservation confirmation and everything was OK untill 2 months later. I took a look at my reservations at the bestwestern.com website and I saw that my whole reservation was cancelled. I had not asked for that! I send a mail to the bestwestern.com and they answered me to contact the free phonenumber in Belgium. So I did. The person I spoke to, was very very helpfull. He looked in the computer to see what has happened and just said \"What a mess\"! All I could do was making a new booking. So I did, the price was a little higher than the original booking and so he adviced me to ask at BestWestern to have the original price, because it was not my fault. I send a mail and they mailed back that it was OK. I looked to my reservation confirmation at their website and yes, they adjusted the higher price to the original price for the 2 rooms. Everything OK again. When we arrived at the McCarran, we had to sign 2 papers, one for each room. We looked at the first paper, and the price was correct. We signed it and signed the second paper too, without taking a good look at it, because we thought that the second room had the same rate. Back home, we saw that the second room had a higher price, it was 13 USD more than the original price. I took again a look at my reservation confirmation at the bestwestern.com and I saw that the price for the second room had been changed after my booking to the higher price. Can this be done???? I was lucky that I took a copy from the original confirmation with the original prices. So I mailed to the McCarran and send them the copy, but I received no answer. Then I mailed to bestwestern.com and they answered me after a week, that they would pay the difference of 13 USD back to me, but without any explination of what happened. Very strange. About the hotel I must say that we were again very pleased with it. For our bargain price, it was very very good, quiet, good breakfast, nice renovated room , no fridge but all the rest is there, good shuttle service.

They run a shuttle service to and from the hotel/aiport, which we didn't use, but it's easy to get to the rental car place from this location, so it was well worth it.

That said, it probably only took 10 minutes after my call from the airport, which wasn't too bad. The hotel is a good 10-15 minute walk off the strip, along a busy highway, so the hourly free shuttle is the best way of getting to the action. It drops off outside the MGM Grand, which is also the pick-up point for the return trip. On a busy night like Saturday, it did seem a bit unnecessary to have to call for a pick-up to and from the Strip, as I'm sure that there were people waiting every hour (and phones are few and far between for us overseas visitors without a local mobile/cell phone). The room was a good size and clean, and check-in was efficient and cheerful. I'm glad that I had booked in advance, as 'Sold Out' signs were plastered over the entrance. Given the proximity to the airport, double glazing would have further minimised any exterior noise, but it was not too bad. The self-serve continental breakfast (free) was good, with several choices of cereals, juices, pastries etc. Unlike some chain motels, there was also a good sized area in which to eat. On my departure, I caught the shuttle to the airport, and the driver kindly dropped me very close to the hire car shuttle bus, which saved lugging my bags across busy traffic.

And then the next morning, when we needed a ride to the airport, we were told the shuttle only ran on the 1/2 hour and even though the van was there at a quarter-past the hour, we still had to wait another 15 minutes for them to take us to the airport. Maybe that is their \"policy\" but it wasn't made clear as to what those policies were before booking the room and honestly, as far as customer service is concerned, I think that is a poor decision not to run your shuttle in a \"city that never sleeps.\" On top of the shuttle disappointment, when we checked in to the room, the lady at the front desk, was rude and just in a \"general bad mood.\" Again, not the face and attitude one wants to see when already disappointed in a service error and then have to deal with rudeness too. She started out rude to my husband and I, but we are good at making people treat us better by just adding a little kindness. That worked, but when additional customers arrived and asked about room availability or customers who called and asked questions about why the shuttle service wasn't running, she was rude to them....which also was annoying. From my perspective of overhearing several inquiries about the shuttle service ending at 7pm, it was something many of their customers did not know and was disappointed to find out. The room itself was clean and comfortable. The lack of \"black-out\" shades was missed since we arrived so late and wanted to sleep in the next morning.

We were here for 5 nights, a friend of ours who was travelling with us got us a room for 29.00 / night as she is a Best Western employee. The rooms were always clean, it was quiet, there were coffee pots in the rooms, and the continental breakfast was always nice. Not a large resort on the strip, but we had our own vehicle with us, and so driving to the strip or the Fremont area was not a problem. We didn't spend much time in the rooms at all, and so only used them to sleep and shower. It was more than adequate for our needs, the staff were friendly and we enjoyed our stay immensely.", "Date": "October 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mass", "Title": "\u201cOne armed bandit\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3933837", "Content": "Rooms ok but high priced for location.
