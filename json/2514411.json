The staff were very polite to our girls telling them stories of the hotel, pointing out the artwork and engaging them in dialogue much as they did with we adults. The staff was professional, prompt and made our stay special - far to contrary of some other poor reviews. The Algonquin's suites are spacious by NYC hotel standards and comfortably accomodated my wife and I and our children. The lobby lounge is first class with its dark wood panels, comfort and class. Our Saturday night stay (during the October snowstorm) found the hotel quite a happening spot at the lounge, Blue Bar and restaurants.

The fittings in the bathroom are especially nice. The lobby is rather lovely as are the cocktails although expensive we spent $60 on a sparkling water and 2 martinis.

The coffee station of the second floor was handy, on one occasion we happened to be grabbing a cup when one of the staff was incredibly sweet to us, he was clearing up from a meeting and insisted on getting us larger cups from the kitchen than the ones provided pouring us Starbucks coffee and giving us free range to the big trays of cookies that were left. We were really touched that he went the extra mile to make us feel at home, and in a city that is supposed to be full of attitude he was one of the many lovely people we met. We didn't use the gym, walking Manhatten was enough exercise for us. I would defnitely go back and I would also recommend the hotel as it is a little oasis of calm in Midtown.

They finally were, after having to make a phone call to the front desk to ask where they were, and then receiving a phone call 5 minutes later, asking what our bags looked like. This was after having left our claim check with the front desk - the bags person said he never received it. We finally received our bags soon thereafter, and they were delivered by a very friendly man - one of the few we encountered. The room itself was ok - supposedly it had just been redone, but apparently the only 're-do' was adding pretty colors - nothing practical about it. We were in a suite because we had met our adult son there and we wanted to stay together. The bathroom was located inside the bedroom, so if our son (who slept on the pull-out sofa in the living room) had to use the bathroom during the night, he would have disturbed us sleeping in the bedroom. The bathroom was very small with virtually no vanity space to put our things, and the bathtub was so high I had trouble stepping into it to take a shower (I am 5'). Anyone with even slight mobility issues would not be able to use the tub/shower. The lighting was horrible and I was unable to put on any makeup because of that, but also because the mirror over the very high sink (again a problem for me because of my height) was also very high and I could not see into it. When we arrived back at our room after an evening out, we were greeted by a very strong smell of marijuana from the room next door. The walls are very thin, and the music and conversation from this same room next door was very loud - we could have joined their conversation if we were so inclined. Our suite was in a corner at the end of a hall, so this one room was the only adjacent room. I am guessing that if you are in a regular room, you would be treated to the voices and conversations on both sides. More surprises in the morning - the new drapes covering the windows were decorative only - the morning light poured in as soon as the sun came up in both the living room and in the bedroom. No black-out curtains here! Upon check-out, we asked where my son could print his boarding pass. He was told by a woman at the front desk (a clone of the woman the day before, personality-wise) that IF the printer was working, we would have to pay for it, and the point was moot anyway, because she told us we needed a room key to be able to use the computer, and we had already checked out. Absolutely no interest in helping us out - none of the friendliness and 'go the extra mile' we have seen in other Marriott hotels. Needless to say, it was one of the worst hotels we have ever stayed in.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "aurorio", "Title": "\u201cNew York History, at a price\u201d", "Author": "aurorio", "ReviewID": "UR118328862", "Content": "Here's the thing about the Algonquin: it is a beautiful, historic hotel, but unless you can get a cheap rate, it's almost not worth it.

Adjusting the setting did not do anything. So I fire up the window AC - which I would bet is inconsistent with the definition of a 4-star room, and although it worked - it was noisy. I was really to tired to deal with a service call, so I put in my earplugs and went to bed. The window unit was load enough to keep me awake with earplugs, so I bit the bullet and turned it off - only to find - that wasnt the noise! The noise was the back alley and a mult-thousand ton rooftop evaporative cooling tower for some other building - humming away at a racket pace throughout the night - oh joy.

A 4-star hotel - nope - 3-star. I'd say it is one step higher than the rooms at the Union League - and no more. I stayed in both an Algonquin suite and a discounted room and both came up short for their price class. The discounted room had a small toilet stuck in a very narrow corner and lots of stained grout. The door knob to the room was only 2 arm lengths from inside the elevator - no elevator banks here. As for the suite, the couch in the living area was stained, the bathroom was huge but the AC was so SO LOUD that you could not hear the TV when it cycled on every few minutes. The AC vent was also situated near the ceiling and blew towards my head, giving me an earache from the cold. In addition, the standard Marriott bedding is used here and is as skimpy as usual - you can never get warm enough. I can say, however, that the Algonquin does not skimp on the AC like some other Marriotts.

Other than those (ugly) sunburst mirrors, the rooms really have no character, the beds are just ok, the TV was lo-def, the heat was a noisy unit by the window, the view was mediocre, and the bathroom was ridiculously small, with a toilet nearly set flush into the corner that requires some kind of side saddle approach by any average sized adult. A friend that stopped up entered the room, immediately pointed at the toilet, and laughed as a first impression. I also stay in a ton of NYC hotel rooms, so it grates a bit when people complain about the size of 4 star rooms (it's Manhattan, get over it) and these were some of the smallest, but what they've done with the space (or failed to) is disappointing. It's not awful, it's just not appealing, and part of my review is against the expectation of a 4 star hotel. If I had the expectation of a 3 star hotel (and the cost) I'd have been relatively happy with it. There's no real lobby except for the restaurant/bar. The bar has some great history and atmosphere (though a decidedly silver haired crowd) but I enjoyed a few very well made $20 cocktails before returning to my generic room.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ipanema, Rio de Janeiro", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, charming hotel, comfortable rooms!\u201d", "Author": "marciopsiq", "ReviewID": "UR115976496", "Content": "Stayed here in the 2nd part of trip to always fabulous NYC.

After a half hour I realized that the room wasn't getting cooler, despite the (in window) AC unit turned up for max cooling. Went downstairs to ask if they could look at it. They assured me that they would, and my wife & I went out for a late lunch. When we arrived 2 hours I asked at the desk if the AC was fixed, the clerk told me that maintenance didn't put in for a service call, so the AC should be working fine. The room was uncomfortably warm at this point. I went back down to demand that we be switched in to a room with a working AC. And they made the switch. Then, quite mysteriously, a man around showed up around 8:30pm to \"fix the closet\". He spackled something in the closet wall and told us not to use it. Couldn't this have waited? Other than that our stay was fine. Of course they only served us half the breakfast we ordered despite repeated requests for our toast and side of fruit, but since it was \"free\" we didn't get upset.

Within moments of my arrival to the hotel, it dawned on me that the Priceline hotel rating was nothing short of a farce. I don't know if the 'old-worlde' look of the property is intentional, and thus, merely trying to recapture its once historical presence, or just a consequence of the owner(s) being too stingy to sink some money into renovations. In any event, with the small, dark lobby, tiny spiral creeky steps down to the outdated bathrooms, and ancient, worn-out mosiac tiling at the entrance to the hotel, I felt utter disappointment at my '4 star' accomodations which only climaxed upon entering my room which was probably less than 100 square feet (not including bathroom) in area. To the hotels credit, the entire room had been recently renovated and was, in and of itself, charming, but nonetheless, difficult to appreciate considering its size. It then became apparent why the hotel clerk that checked me in had indicated that no standard rooms offered two beds--they would not fit. She was, however, able to find me a room with a Queen size bed, rather then Full size, which is what most Standard rooms offer. There is also no pool. The service in the hotel was average at best. While most intereactions I had were positive, on one occasion, I was given attitiude when I could not find something in the hotel. I explcitily asked the hotel staff member, \"can you please walk me over to the...I really can't find it\". She basically said no, until I begged.

So this review might not be applicable for travellers booking standard rooms. Also, I am fully aware that the Algonquin is a very old hotel, so this is also considered in the overall rating. Room: The suite we had was really nice. Small bedroom whith walk-in closet. Nice living room with sofa, two armchairs and desk, two flatscreen TVs. Bathroom is old and small, but OK. The room being at the end of the hallway was quiet. Doors are hardly soundproofed, so everything happening outside can & will be heard. Not a problem in the suite as the sleeping room has a separate door. I would not want to stay in a standard room directly facing the elevators. Overall I was very satisfied with the accomodation. Facilities: Business center (for a fee) and small, but sufficient fitness center (new, free) is available. Free Internet (Wifi and cable) with acceptable speed. Small reception desk, lovely lounge and a separate coctail bar and restaurant. Had breakfast everyday (approx. 25 USD per person). Not cheap, but good. Did only try food at the bar which was good and filling. Service: Alomst all employees I was in contact with were very friendly and helpful, above average. Some extra requests have been fulfilled quickly. Overall: I was staying for Leisure. I doubt that I would choose the hotel on a business trip, as I expect things like quiet rooms, quick check-in/out etc on such trips. Being on vacation, I enjoyed that the overall atmosphere was very calm and did not have issues that things like restaurant service, elevators (2 available) were a little bit slower as elsewhere. In fact, I really appreciated the relaxed atmosphere as this is a nice contrast to the hectic life outside in Midtown. Although being very close to Times Sq, some nice restaurants are in vicinity. Summary: Would I stay again? Absolutely, but not on a business trip and probably not in a standard room.

FYI the hotel did not reopen and this place is very old and Marriott needs to take this out of their Autograph Collection immediately!!! (People that stay in Marriotts frequently have certain expectations. This hotel clearly does not meet those of a distiguished traveler) Ok, so despite the efftort to make our reservations in advance, our friends room was not ready until 4:30pm and no consolation was offered to them. Not even a drink at the bar while they waited. Not acceptable when check in is at 3pm. Furthermore, the front desk was rude and unfriendly (typical NYC I guess?). My husband and I had a king suitte. The room was spacious but odd. Two other doors were in our sitting area that led to other guest rooms. I could hear every word that other guests said and I am sure they had to listen to me and my friends until 3am when we got back to our hotel and retired to my sitting area. However, no complaints were lodged. The room was spacious but the bathroom was a closet. The toilets were like subway toilets and were so hard to flush!!!! Everytime we went to the bathroom we spent 5+ minutes trying to get the darn thing to flush. Ridiculous!! And then there was the shower/tub. It was the original from 108 years ago when the hotel opened. Need I say more....GROSS!!!! And only one person could stand in the bathroom at a time bc it was so small. Luckily there was a mirror on the door so my husband could swing it open and get dressed. Finally, when we went to check out and we called down for our car there was a 45 minute wait for the valet.

Then a rollaway jammed into our room so my 84-year-old mother had to practically climb over beds to get to the bathroom. To make up for the trouble we were given a complimentary breakfast that made highway rest stop food seem gourmet. How could this be the Algonquin we've come to love? This had to be a fluke. So, we reserved a room for July 21, one of the hottest days on record. The door staff was unresponsive to my old Mom exiting our cab with a carry-on bag in her hand. The front desk staff was no more competent than our last visit and certainly surly. When we learned our early check in room was not ready, we were admonished that they were \"very busy.\" Finding a little table in the lobby we could do nothing but wait. Mom wanted a drink. The lobby wait staff fell over each other, yet our order of a cheese plate took nearly an hour to arrive. Finally making it to the room we discovered an amusing little card on our nightstand that read in part \"In the city that never sleeps, Matilda (the resident cat) thinks these may help you\" and were directed to the ear plugs in the drawer. We enjoy city noise and have never had a problem sleeping with it humming in the background. But we soon learned that the room's AC system was so loud it justified Matilda's gift! Turn it off and you can't breathe. Turn it on and you can't sleep. What has happened to our beloved Algonquin? No greetings made, no assistance offered, no goodbyes, no more will we stay at the Algonquin.

I had attended cabaret performances at the Oak Room several times and was always curious to discover the experience of going upstairs to a room in the legendary hotel. I finally had my chance and booked a room. Dorothy Parker said that there is no cure for curiosity...Yes, there is....Disappointment. To begin with, the room was small...no, not just small, but TINY. I know it is New York, but I have stayed at many hotels in the city and have never seen a room so small. It was not even nicely decorated and the amenities were from a rather common retail store. Really? That's the best they can do? No disrepect to the chain store of grooming products, but I expected more. We had some troubles with the room and the front desk seemed bothered that we brought the issue to their attention. The night manager was rude and hostile. Not once did he apologize for the inconvenience. He just shrugged his shoulders and said there was no other option. Yes, there was. We left and went to another hotel that was better by a \"Millenium\". The front desk clerk at the other property said he was sorry that we had such a bad experience and upgraded us to a room on a high floor that had amazing views and which gave us the chance to actually sit in a chair and open our suitcases on the floor and still have room to walk around the bed. The Algonquin may have been a grand hotel in its time, but its time has passed. Does anybody still really care that Dorothy Parker stayed there? It is small, dimly lit and not nicely decorated. To compensate, I suppose, they offer a staff that is incompetent, unfriendly and most unhelpful. Sadly, the experience has so soured me that I am not even sure I want to go back to the Oak Room, despite the fact that some of my favorite performers appear there. I think I would be sickened by my memories if I had to walk back through the front door again. It was an awful, simply awful visit. Such a horrible way to live out a long standing dream.

I laughingly said \u201cno the round table wouldn\u2019t haunt the place. They weren\u2019t exactly a happy bunch here\u2013 why would they hang around?\u201d Then I remembered in a previous stay I was on the elevator and I heard the song in my head \u201cI\u2019m In The Mood For Love\u201d and I jokingly asked aloud who was singing it?

We are in the lobby again waiting for the elevator, the doors open to a woman who has luggage and is exasperated. I ask \u201care you getting off?\u201d She responds with a little whimper in her voice \u201cno I\u2019m trying to get to my floor, the 9th floor but it won\u2019t stop there!\u201d I laughed and confidently entered the elevator, making a joke about it really being haunted but since we are regulars here we\u2019ll ride to her floor and see her off safely! Meanwhile, it stops at every other floor \u2013 opens to no one and closes\u2013 very creepy, we finally got her to the 9th floor and return to our 5th floor safely. That night while sleeping in the comfy hotel bed I am awakened as I hear a noise similar to moving furniture (a dragging as if on a wooden floor only the hotel rooms are carpeted). It is coming from above our suite which is 506. Dorothy lived and as someone wrote attempted to die many times in 1106.

The lobby has art deco character with big-apple charm and was invariably lively, with all-comers revelling in the history and ambience of the hotel. Staff are friendly and attentive, but their availability was rather erratic with sometimes as many as 5 or more staff around the reception/concierge, down to occasionally just one (very busy) clerk! If you need to ask anything, catch them while you can - don't leave it until another time as their may be no-one free to help you then! Don't read too much into 'small/slow lifts' comments. There are 2 available, each holding 8 people. They'll get you to your floor smoothly and more quietly than most, so those opinions are relative. Same goes for the bathrooms. Plenty of photos have been posted which show the rooms with a bath, a shower, etc... and easily enough floor space for more than 1 person. I guess some people need more 'space' than others. When it comes to the rooms themselves though, comments universally confirm that they are definitely small. The hotel's own site photos show only the larger rooms and suites, which don't form the majority of accomodation. Having said that, we had a large suitcase each, which were adequately stowed and their contents stored in the wardrobe and chest of drawers. There was still space and hangers to spare and with 2 armchairs, a desk and bedside tables too, there's a lot of furniture. So if you plan to spend time strolling in your room and want lots of floorspace, you'll probably need a suite here. Otherwise, if like the majority of us, you want a haven that is very comfortable, clean and provides superbly located accomodation that is just perfect for a respite from the day's strolling around New York sights, then you should find it here. Want a quiet room? Ask for one at the back of the hotel AND away from the lifts. (In New York, a 12 storey hotel is not going to offer you 'views' of anything worth seeing and all rooms that front onto the street will be noisy 24/7.) To help you explore the sights and get around in general, consider buying a Metrocard - a top up card for travel on New York buses and subways. Being so central though, there are many places to eat and drink nearby but I would suggest avoiding any of the restaurants alongside the hotel (although they are, perhaps inevitably, recommended by hotel staff) particularly the Greek restaurant, which is overrated, pretty expensive and the service slow PLUS there's not a Greek person in site, which whiffs of pretention. The exception is the coffee shop/diner almost next door (called the Red Flame I think?) which is always frequented by New Yorkers and it's easy to understand why. Highly recommended. Take note too that although hotel's own bar and restaurant are fine, their drinks are so expensive, it's hard to really enjoy more than 1 (eg. $17 for a glass of wine) If they're important to you, you may also want to take the following into consideration too: Pros: Housekeeping left a daily complementary bottle of water and the safe in the room was free of charge. Cons: There are no tea/coffee making facilities and housekeeping never did a turn down service in our room. Minibar was available on request only. Top Tip: Shop around for prices to this hotel.

The same two drinks in a bar would be $11, so its worth shopping around the bars for the best price. We also met Matilda the cat, she is gorgeous, although she was not in the mood for guests when we met her. The location of the hotel is fantastic, close to everything you need, we only used taxi's on our last day as our legs could physically do no more walking....

Between the hours of 7am to 9am it could take you 20 minutes wait to get on one. Most of the staff uses the stairs unless they have a cart (and if they do enter you have no more space).

The two elevators fit a maximum of 3 people and take 5-10 minutes to summon to your floor so this was a lengthy process. Once I was finally able to get a working key after multiple and time consuming trips to reception, I discovered the room was just large enough to fit the bed and provide a walkway around the edge of the bed. I\u2019ve been to NYC a number of times but this was truly incredible. I asked to be moved to a larger room; that was not possible until the next day. Day 2 I was finally able to move to a slightly larger room and a member of the hotel staff arrived at the room to personally let me know. I was told to go down to reception and get a new key. I was about to pick up my bags and move them to the new room however, the staff member said my bags would be moved and taken care of and not to worry. I moved to my new room and waited for over an hour for my bags. They did not appear and I decided to head out to my next meeting without changing my shoes which had been soaked through by an afternoon rainstorm. I also had to call for a TV repair person for this new room; fortunately that service was turned around quickly. I returned to the hotel after my meeting and while in the lobby bar, thought I would pick up some ice for cold water in my room. There are no ice machines on individual floors\u2019 a call to room service for delivered ice is the only way to get ice. I thought since I was already in the lobby bar where there should be ice this would be much easier than going up to the room and waiting for room service. I asked a waiter and was told I had to go to my room and call for room service and wait. There were a handful of people in the bar and this waiter wasn't helping anyone, I believe he was arranging the fake candles that go on the tables. Fortunately, I found another waiter who was willing to provide me with a glass of ice. I returned to the new room; by this time I had been moved to the new room for over 3 hours. Still no bags. I spoke to reception and was told that my bags had been moved. Clearly this was not the case and at this point reception said they had no idea where my bags were. Edwin at the front desk left his post and looked for my bags himself. He was able to locate them, in the old room, and moved them himself. He went out of his way to make sure I finally had my bags. Day 3 After a day of meetings and late dinner, I returned to my room to find that a shirt which had been left on the bed was no longer there. I called down and spoke to Nelson the night manager who explained that it likely was wrapped up in the bed linens when they were changed but unfortunately housekeeping was closed for the night. He offered to look in lost & found and would call back. I did not receive a call back that night. The next morning I called reception who knew nothing about this. I spoke to housekeeping, who also had not been informed, and they could not locate the shirt. Day 4 Upon check out, I asked again about my missing shirt and nothing. There seemed to be very little concern about this, just an offer for a free breakfast which incidentally my room rate already came with this free breakfast.

The doorman ran down 44th to rescue it ... and my entire trip! I was able to get into my room before 11a.m. so I could get settled early. The desk staff was helpful at check-in, check-out, and in-between. The bellman was friendly and full of information, and we often chatted about my theater experiences. The concierge went out of his way to help me satisfy my curiosity about the long line at Bryant Park -- it was for the skating rink! The location could not be beat ... a super-easy walk to Broadway shows, shopping (esp. the dozens of Bryant Park's holiday kiosks), banks (I needed these after my Bryant Park shopping spree!), restaurants, Fifth Avenue for the holiday lights, Grand Central Station for its light show, etc. My room was small but comfortable.

I will start with the positives, it was a very clean hotel, with good service and the rooms have all be updated quite recently to a high standard. However, the rooms are VERY small, and it can be very noisy overnight. Now I know that being pretty central, you have to expect some noise, however, the windows in the rooms, combined with a large a/c unit meant that allot of street noise got in, so much in fact, that it was just as noisy with the windows open. I don't ask much from a hotel except that I have to be able to sleep in it, which I found very hard. The noise is particularly bad at the moment, as there is allot of building work going on next to the hotel, which does start very early. A coffee maker is also absent, which is pretty poor for any hotel, let alone on as expensive as this. This would have not been too bad, except the hotel menu was particularly expensive, even for a cup of coffee. Having stayed in a wide range of hotels, of many different stars, I cant say that the Algonquin deserves the 4 stars is has, 3 would be more appropriate and it would still need a coffee maker.

I came in a day early to rest up before the intense training I would be attending. Unfortunately at 11:30 pm on that Saturday night, I was awakened by the staff person who had checked me in. He had two workmen with him who he said needed to come in and repair my air conditioner (which seemed to be working okay to me). I had fallen asleep watching TV so was fuzzy-headed and stupidly let them in. After a few minutes though I realized it was almost midnight! The workmen were very nice and apologetic, but the rest of the staff at the hotel seemed unable to explain to me WHY they would be doing maintenance in an occupied room at midnight. The new air conditioner worked better, but I wouldn\u2019t have known the difference if they\u2019d waited until the next morning. When I talked to the manager, she apologized and said I would be compensated. This turned out to come in the form of a free breakfast. Whoopee. Especially insulting given that the company I was working for already had paid for me to have breakfast at the hotel. The amount of the tip came to more than breakfast next door at the diner would have cost altogether. Other than that\u2026the room was small but perfectly comfortable as was the bed.

The Red Flame diner next door and the DBistro on the other side are both great (although opposite ends of the dining experience spectrum). Street noise in my room (on the 9th floor) was horrible. It was compounded by an idiot in a Lamborghini who parked on the curb outside and revved his engine every three hours ALL NIGHT LONG. My colleagues who had rooms on the other side of the building heard that, but said that otherwise the rooms were quieter than mine. I thought the building was beautiful and I was very happy to stay at such a historic icon.

We stayed at the Algonquin for 3 nights over the Memorial Day weekend. We were greeted by an average bellman who did not say hello or welcome or anything. He just opened to door. While waiting to check in, we were greeted by a very cold staff at the front desk. The concierge, whom I had made eye contact with when I went up to the desk, could not be bothered to let the other staff know that there were people waiting in line so we actually had to ring the bell. The room was small, but very nice. It was exactly what I would expect from a Vintage Hotel. The bed was amazing. The bathroom was again tiny, but enough room for 1 person. The location was great! You can not ask for a better location. It's right in the heart of the Theater District. I was very disappointed that there was not a coffee maker in the room. It was one thing that I really need when I get up. While the coffee in those services is not the best, it\u2019s at least a hot cup of coffee to start your day. I opted for ordering room service at a total charge of $18.00 for a 20oz carafe of coffee. We also ran into trouble with the Housekeeping staff. The Algonquin site boasts the worlds class housekeeping. I would beg to differ. On returning to our room after a long day of shopping we came into the room to find a shopping bag filled with rubbish from other rooms. I quickly called down to the front desk and advised them of the issue. Twenty minutes later they sent a housekeeper who had very little knowledge of the English Language to remove bag from the room. I did receive a very timid \"I'm Sorry\" from the woman. The Next morning was much the same, I needed my coffee and was forced to either walk down the street to get a coffee or pay $18.00 for room service. It was far too easy to dial the phone! I have to admit the coffee from room service was VERY GOOD. We left the room around 10 A.M. and planned on spending the entire day out and about. We returned to the Hotel very late at about 11 P.M. for a quick freshen up and then out for a night out on the town. We walked in to the faint smell of spoiled milk. The cleaning staff never removed the tray that contained the coffee service from that morning. I went down stairs to speak to a manager. He stated that he would have the tray removed at once and when asked what would be done to resolve the issue, I was told that the Manager would discuss it with me the next morning. He totally passed the issue off to the staff the following morning. We went out and when we returned to our floor we were greeted by the coffee tray in front of the 'service closet' with the spoiled milk still there. I guess they were waiting for the Algonquin House Cat to come and have a sip of milk before going to bed! The next morning was check out! We were again greeted by a very cold staff. When I asked the women if they had been made aware of the issue with my room, the woman acknowledged that she was in fact made aware and that the Housekeeping Manager was aware of the problems.

I realized that I needed to speak to the General Manager as I was becoming more frustrated as time went on. My request was met with the extremely negative body language. Upon her return, she stated that the manager would be right out to speak to me momentarily. Ten Minutes later the manager never showed up to speak with me. I was so angry that I just walked out.

The guest rooms are as small as I remembered but nicely remodeled and very clean. The mattress was comfortable and the linens were top notch.

The hotel certainly has it's charm, the renovation of all the common areas is well done; nice, inviting and it stayes true to the hotels great history and ambiance. My room on the seventh floor and was very quiet other than a few rude neighbors that like to slam doors, the hotel has no control over them. The very best asset of The Algonguin are the support staff, the doormen, the bellman, the housekeepers and the maintenance crew are polite, friendly and always with a smile. Like all the reviews reveal, the elevators ARE a nightmare so here is your opportunity to meet them all while you wait and wait to decide whether to just take the stairs or not. The worst asset hands down is the front desk staff. The check in reception was cold and not at all welcoming. I approached the desk a few other times during my five night stay and got the cold shoulder again and again. At check out she never once looked up. All I got was \"room number?..... and your paid up\" She turned around and never looked back. No thank you, hope you enjoyed your stay....no nothing. You can't beat the location and if your a single business traveler or tourist it's a good choice If you need help rely on the doorman on duty. They were all great.

It's a lovely boutique hotel but with horrendous construction noise! Our first night was in Room 1205. It was a cute, sunny room with a big bow window and window seat. It wasn't a large room but we're used to that in the city. When shown to my room, I noticed the construction site down below but thought, hey, we'll only be in the room to sleep so it shouldn't be a problem. At 1 AM I cursed myself for that thought as the construction was just stopping for the night. It resumed again around 6 AM with jack hammering, loud \"backing up\" beeps, and an air horn going off every 15 -20 minutes. Needless to say we were exhausted and it was ruining my birthday. On the way past the front desk, we expressed our complaints and were cheerfully moved to another room, 507, in the inner court.. This was even an upgrade to a larger room with a king size bed at no extra charge. It was much quieter but there is no escaping the air horns from the construction site. We both slept soundly for our second night. Try to get a room numbered 9-12 on each floor (ex 509 for the fith floor) as these rooms are on the front side of the hotel furthest from the construction site in the back. We thought the hotel staff was great. They were all very friendly and greeted you as you went in and out of the hotel. We got a kick out of Matilda, the hotel cat , who lounged around like the Queen of Sheba. We ate our breakfast a few doors down at the Red Flame diner. We had very expensive drinks ($16 each) in the Blue Bar to celebrate the end of my birthday. The drinks were wonderful. We also went to see the musical Curtains starring David Hyde Pierce from the Frazier show. It was a fun, entertaining show! We can't understand why it wasn't packed. We purchased our tickets online thru www.tdf.org for $36 each. In spite of the construction, we would stay at the Algonquin again.

We booked through Expedia and got a great rate (under $300.00 a night), so we weren't expecting a premier suite by any means. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We have stayed at two other hotels on that same block and the Algonquin certainly measured up. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful, from the front desk to the doormen. Matilda the resident feline is a very nice touch! Our room was rather small, but in New York that is to be expected. It was still bigger than many hotel rooms I've stayed in when in Europe, and even in New York.The bed was a King and it was exceptionally comfortable, the room was very clean and tidy. The bathroom was also very functional, no bathtub but the shower was fine, in size and water pressure. Housekeeping was very thorough and accommodating, I like to lounge around the room when on vacation and they were always very good about not disturbing me - magically the room was always cleaned when I returned, no matter how late I left. It's true the elevators are small (and slow). We were on the 10th floor so the stairs were not really an option. Having travelled throughout Europe where small elevators are the norm, it didn't bother us at all. The location is superb, close to everything, and there's a most excellent diner right next door, the Red Flame - didn't even need to put on a coat to run over there.

The noise is certainly not the hotel's fault, and it stopped after those first two days. I certainly don't hold the Algonquin responsible for New York's construction industry! I think the reviews here that complain about the style of the hotel fail to keep in mind the very essence of the Algonquin. It is a landmark and a historical building, the oldest hotel in NYC. It's not meant to be a trendy spot - it is a classic in the European tradition. I find it very telling that the negative reviews are mostly from North Americans, while visitors from Europe love it.

Unfortunately, our woes began immediately. We arrived shortly after 3 p.m. I parked the car and my wife went inside to check in. At the desk, a female guest cut in front of my wife. This guest complained loudly about the overpowering smell of paint in her suite. The desk moved her to a new suite. My wife then stepped up to check in to our suite. She was told that our suite was not ready and there would be a delay. We then waited until about 4:30, cooling our heels in the lobby, with our 2 kids who were itching to get over to Times Square. I went to the desk several times. On the 2d visit I was given 2 free breakfast passes, although there were four of us. Finally, we were brought upstairs to a suite on the 10th floor - - - which was gorgeous but reeked of fresh paint and did not include the pull out couch which was promised and necessary for our kids. No big mystery how and why we ended up in the \"paint suite\". I advised the desk the paint suite was unacceptable because, aside from the obvious, our kids would have no place to sleep. After a short wait we then had to move our luggage to a new suite - - an old, dark, non-updated, back of the building space with dirty windows on the 5th floor - - and right on top of an active construction site which was so loud we could not hear each other speak inside the room. The coup de grace was yet to come. Thinking it was a closet, my wife opened our half of the pass-through door into the next room. Our neighbor then opened her side door and screamed at my wife \"this is another room\" and slammed her door. My wife then had some words through the walls. Things then got surreal, when the phone rang. The front desk had called to warn us that our neighbor had complained. My wife then began to cry and told the front desk the full story. The front desk could not have cared less, and advised my wife that the complainant had been moved to another room. The attitude was \"that's the way it is\". My wife was then inconsolable. We are not complainers but we have never had such a negative experience at any other hotel. The unpleasant lady next door was certainly not the hotel's fault, but the hotel's insensitivity to my wife's side of it, as well as to her recounting of the other problems we had experienced, certainly was.

Overall, the experience was really uneven \u2013 all of the previous reviews are basically accurate. While nothing rose to the level of being truly disastrous, the whole experience left me a bit frustrated and disappointed. It wasn\u2019t all bad, however: The Good 1. Great Location. For sure the best thing about the hotel is its stellar location on 44th between 5th and 6th, within walking distance of the Theater District and Grand Central. 2. Historical ambiance. The Algonquin is a charming old hotel. The lobby has an unmistakable ambiance \u2013 it\u2019s not that big and a tad dumpy, but throughout my stay there were people hanging out enjoying themselves and there was actually something of a scene there, if you could call it that. The cabaret was busy at night. There were quirky quotes on the fronts of each of the doors. 3. Clean rooms and comfortable bed. I thought the bed was exceptionally comfortable. The room was small but no worse than plenty of other NY hotels. I thought the bathroom was fine \u2013 not great but fine. My colleague even had a renovated room with new furniture. The flat screen TV was also a nice touch. 4. Decent food. I had one dinner and one breakfast at the hotel. Although the prices were unmistakably NY high, the food wasn\u2019t bad. We ate another night next door at Caf\u00e9 DB, home of the $75 hamburger (in which I didn\u2019t partake). 5. Good prices. I paid in the low $300\u2019s for my room. Had I stayed at the swanky Royalton across the street it would\u2019ve cost me more than twice what I paid and for a room which was much smaller. 6. Great door men. I thought the door men did an exceptional job, particularly given the cold, wet, snowy weather. They were friendly, they helped out with the luggage in the cab, they made a great first impression. 7. The Algonquin cat. I guess there\u2019s a legend about a cat that lives at the Algonquin. Sure enough, the cat was there at the front desk. I thought it was a nice touch. 8. Lots of papers to choose from. I liked coming down the elevator and having my choice of the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, USA Today or NY Post in addition to the USA Today at my door. The Not as Good 1. There is construction going on next door. I was out by 7 and not back until after dinner each day so I missed the noise, but if you want a quiet night\u2019s sleep or to sleep in, this isn\u2019t the place for you. My colleague got chocolates in their room each night. I got ear plugs. Seriously. I will say that the hotel told me upfront when I checked in about the construction and they indicated that they moved me to the back of the building so it would be quieter and they warned me of the hours of construction, so they made the best of it in my opinion. 2. Rooms don\u2019t have all the fixins. No coffee maker. No mini-bar. Plugs aren\u2019t well located. Wi-fi didn\u2019t work all the time \u2013 first night it was free and the second night they tried to charge me. No business center. 3. Not a lot of style. There is a fuddy duddy-ness to the lobby and the rooms. Perhaps this will be corrected in their renovation. The wallpaper on the upper floors was positively garish (not to mention peeling in a few places). 4. Slow elevators. I ended up taking the stairs from the third floor. 5. Funky front desk policies. At one point I asked for an Advil. They said that they wouldn\u2019t give me one, and no hotel would do that because of the liability. I\u2019ve had lots of hotels give me lots of over the counter drugs. Also, I had to sign something on my registration form in which I acknowledged that I would have to pay half if I checked out early. I\u2019ve never had to do that before. The bottom line, you get what you pay for. In a City where everything costs an arm and leg, even a hotel room for under $400 can be considered cheap. Fortunately, I slept great and didn\u2019t have a bad experience.

The dark atmosphere in the lobby is not our taste, but we also have not to work there. We had a room in the 3rd floor so we could take the stairs which was a great advantage as wating for the elevators sometimes seemed to be an endless task.

The a/c is certainly one problem, but if you have a room towards the back, you can live experience how the hard rock of Manhattan island is drilled for a new construction. If you the ask to get a different room and get a room facing the street, you find out when exactly the trash is picked up and all other truck activities for the ongoing construction next door is happening....and this starting at 3am, when for us the night was over. We only stayed there 3 nights, so there was no point in fighting it an switch rooms again. The main problem is the old single glass windows, that do not absorb any noise and the window a/c, where a lot of noise also can pass through. It usually takes a lot to wake me in the middle of the nigth (we have 3 small children, so we are used to sleep with a lot of background noise), but the 3 nights in the Algonquin were certainly not worth the money.

She knows I visit NYC frequently and wanted me along to show her the town. Her company had booked her in the Algonquin because it was directly across the street from the offices where she was scheduled to teach seminars. We changed the reservation from a single to a twin and asked for an early check-in, 1 PM versus the 3 PM official check-in, and were assured they'd do their best to accommodate that. We arrived shortly after 1 PM and our room was not ready, and the front desk would only tell us that they would \"try\" to get it done earlier, but that we should not expect it before 3 PM, and that they could not even estimate when the room might be ready. Hmmm.... So we checked our bags and went out to kill two hours. We returned after 3 PM and were shown to our room. The bell staff were, by the way, excellent. The front desk staff were usually chatting with each other and acted annoyed when they were interrupted to deal with a guest. I stay in NYC, midtown, frequently. I have never seen such a tiny room for that price. There were two beds (way too soft for both our preferences, and I like a soft bed), a small night table which was already completely covered with a lamp and a phone, a very small desk, mostly occupied with promotional material and another lamp, and a tiny closet, made even tinier by the safe, telephone book, ironing board, and iron already crammed in there. Not a drawer anywhere to put anything except the one in the tiny night table, which already contained the requisite Gideon bible. There was hardly enough space around the beds to navigate without hitting a wall or furniture. And because we had to live out of our suitcases (since there was nowhere to put our things except the tiny closet), and the suitcases had to sit on luggage stands, that meant even less space. We were on the 4th floor, directly across from an office building, and the street noise (especially when they pick up the garbage late at night, every night, from the hotel's restaurants) was pretty loud. The bathroom was similarly tiny (sensing a theme here?), with a narrow shelf over the toilet already covered with the kleenex and the complementary toiletries (from some Australian company I've never heard of). Another narrow, short shelf was over the sink. That completed the bathroom storage. We've got two women here for three days. You can imagine we were thrilled there was nowhere to put any toiletries at all. Additionally, there was a dark brown, nasty something in the toilet. When we complained, politely, to the front desk, a very nice maintenance man came right up, worked on the toilet a few minutes, asked for our phone, and contacted the front desk to ask them to give us another room. Sadly, they had no other twins available, or so they said. The maintenance guy did the best he could, but the toilet was disgusting the entire stay and never flushed properly. We were never offered any discount or even an apology by the front desk for the problem. The A/C (it was extremely hot and humid in NY during our stay) was very loud. The free WiFi in the room was spotty and s-l-o-o-o-w. There was no coffee maker (besides, where would you put it?), and the free coffee in the lobby was only available up to 7 AM, at which time it promptly disappears. No coincidence that 7 AM is when their restaurant opens. Room service only provides liquor and breakfast, and that's it. The good news is the gym on the 3rd floor, which is reasonably well equipped and FREE. We used it every day. Also, Matilda, the resident kitty, is a nice touch. And housekeeping was unobtrusive and thorough. Sheets on the bed were high quality. We never ate at the restaurants, but were not very impressed by the menu choices and felt the prices were inordinately high. You can do much better with so many restaurants not far from the hotel. Red Flame is great for breakfast or other diner-type choices. Monster Sushi is a couple of blocks north, DB Moderne is two doors down (if you want to spend more), etc. Frankly, we would never stay here again.

The hotel has a great location - 44th St between 5th and 6th Avenues, which was convenient to Times Square, the Theatre District, and Grand Central Terminal. The hotel itself is very distinguished looking...the bellmen and concierge were great, although the front desk people really didn't seem very friendly. Our room had a king size bed - which was great! Problem was, there is only about 12\" clearance around the bed, which makes it very cramped. The bathroom is postage-stamp sized, and the closet is small. You have to call room service for ice, as there are no ice or soda machines available to guests. Some other things you should be aware of: 1. When you get the confirmation from the hotel and it indicates a total price of $xxx.xx, don't believe it; they add $60/day for \"incidentals\" to the amount they guarantee your card for. While it's customary for hotels to swipe cards for slightly more than the actual room costs for things like long distance, etc, I thought $60/day was excessive. 2. Wi-fi is free, but connectivity is nearly impossible. If you can actually GET connected, it'll cost you $9.95/day for broadband access. 3. Skip the ridiculously overpriced meals and go out. Breakfast was especially very overpriced; go to the diner next door. Food was good, service was lightning quick, and very reasonable. If you're going to the theatre, Carmine's is very close by and the food is amazing. Bring a HUGE appetite, though. There are several restaurants on the same block as the hotel. 4.

We stayed for 8 nights in a 2 rooms premier suite, which was rather expensive (560USD av. per night with tax), but also nice and comfortable; the only cons was the bed sofa where our 20yrs old daughter slept: it was quite tough and bumpy, so, even if her room was elegant and spacious, well equipped with fridge, huge plasma tv set and other amenities, my daughter kept complaining. My sleeping room was a bit smaller, but the queen bed was really soft, so my husband and I enjoyed it. The bathroom was a bit small too, with a small bathtub, that looked old fashioned, with a strange draining system, and of course no bidet...but you must be really lucky to find one out of Italy...LOL For our clothes there was only a small cabinet and a medium sized piece of furniture which was nice but couldn't be defined a wardrobe, anyhow we managed to put all our things in order. The staff were really nice and kind: the doorman and the bellboys were always ready to be useful to us, so was the concierge, the receptionists were a bit hasty, but efficient. The maids kept the room well clean but they didn't refresh it in the afternoon as it happens in most luxury hotels. They even have complimentary laptops, which was great for my daughter to keep in touch with her friends in Italy, but if you really need a pc, better bring yours cause they have only one or two and they are often taken. Breakfast wasn't included in the price and it was expensive, specially since there was no buffet and anyhing you order extra the standard Continental or American breakfast they serve is added to the already high price ( 15/21 USD plus tax and tip). Nevertheless it is worth while because that Round Table room of theirs is very elegant and full of historical reminiscences, besides the waiters are fun: most of them are small and a bit fussy, strangely alike the Humpa Lumpas in the movie \"The chocolate factory\" with Johnny Depp. We didn't have dinner here because in the menu there was nothing appealing to our delicate Italian palates and couldn't have tea in the lobby in the afternoon cause they explained us that it wasn't tea time, so they didn't serve any, We were obviously struck by the beauty and charm of the wonderful Matilda, The famous Algonquin cat.

I chose the Algonquin because of its rich literary history, the lovely ambiance, and the wonderful experiences I had previously enjoyed in the bar/restaurant of the hotel. I checked in the evening before the exam, and was shown to a decrepit room with peeling wallpaper and stained carpeting - the room was also very noisy, despite my request for a room in the back of the hotel. I saw another queen deluxe room across the hall being cleaned, and when I called the front desk to ask if I could be moved into that room, the woman condescendingly replied that it was not in \"my price range\" since I had booked through Priceline - despite the fact that it was an identical Queen deluxe room - and that New York is a noisy city (I should know I've lived here for 8 years). She also stated that the hotel was booked up & I would have to stay in the room. Eventually, several phone calls later, and after requesting to speak to her supervisor, I was moved to a more acceptable room - obviously, the hotel was not in fact booked up. I had planned on staying an extra evening after the Bar exam to relax and recuperate, but based on my unpleasant experience, I chose to check out immediately after the bar exam. Upon approaching the valet to request my luggage (which I had left on the final morning of the exam), I was ignored while he chit-chatted with another worker. Another woman who had just taken the Bar was also with me, waiting for her luggage. The valet told us something along the lines of \"you girls will just have to wait.\" Girls? Unbelievable. The worst part was that I wrote a letter to the manager of the hotel, detailing my experience, and never received a response.

There was an awful noise and vibrating as there was construction work on a building behind the hotel. The receptionist assured us that it would stop at 6pm (but then confessed it started at 7am). The following day was my birthday so it was disheartening to think I would be woken up in such an unpleasant way! The noise was not the fault of the hotel, so we decided to try and make the best of it. Our room was small and very noisy. We went down to the bar around 5pm to have some tea (it was way too noisy to have room service). The bar manager was sniffy and said \"we aren't serving tea\". We actually brought our own tea bags, so all we wanted was hot water and milk. I explained we were guests and that it was impossible to relax upstairs in the room. He begrudgingly let us sit in the dining area (but said \"I have to charge you for tea even if you use your own tea bags...\" GEE THANKS..) The noise stopped at 6pm which was bliss. The next morning, it started up again at 7am so we ordered tea and toast from room service. This ended up costing nearly $40 which is outrageous.

I switched to another hotel that charges over twice nightly what I paid for one night at the Algonquin, and was glad I did. All that the Algonquin has going for it comes from the hotel's historical legacies -- the renovated architecture, the legends of the Round Table and the wonderful gentlemen who run their bell service. This is a unique and special hotel offering unmatched by other hotels in NYC and indeed the U.S. Unfortunately, the current owners have packaged this incredible American historical venue with a theme park mentality instead of with the subtlety and taste that their previous literary clientele enjoyed at the hotel in its earlier years. Thanks to the historical sensitivity of new owners in the 1980's who did the hotel\u2019s first major renovations, much of the hotel's architecture and style has been restored to period and remains intact and beautiful. However the current owners have reduced the cosmetic decor to a caricature of the history by putting up wallpaper with \"New Yorker\" cartoons. Also the white paint in the rooms, instead of the former richly colored Edwardian wallpaper, mars any sense of the period of the hotel's glory days. The rooms are so small and dated that their charm and appeal only comes from their history, so this aspect has been damaged -- although it could be reversed with new wallpaper. The life of the hotel emanates from the legendary bellstaff, some who have been with the hotel for decades. They are the best in NYC because of their personalities. Outside of the friendly and wonderful doorman (wonderful, authentic smile), the accomodating bellstaff, the courteous front desk, and excellent housekeeping, the rest of the service is dicey. The hostesses and waitstaff in the lobby area were inattentive and patronizing. As other reviewers have noted, there's age discrimination at play in this hotel. The restaurant staff seemed to focus on the late middle-aged men. I don't know if the management is intentionally marketing this hotel to an ultraconservative 55/60+crowd who like to drink a lot of alcohol. ANYC friend who came by to see the lobby for nolstagic reasons (his last visit had been when his father brought him to the Algonquin 20 years ago when he was 16) confirmed this sense I had about the odd political atmosphere of the hotel. We're both traditional and politically moderate ourselves. A mainstream media executive very familiar with the NYC media scene, my friend confirmed that the free neo-conservative, rightist newspaper offered in the Algonquin lobby \"The Sun\" indeed takes a well-known adversarial stance to the paper that he used to work for, \"The New York Times.\" We thought the discrepancy between touting the hotel's legacy of its association with the liberal \"New Yorker,' which the hotel provides, but hides in a drawer in the room, was rather creepy. Also, if you're in your thirties or even forties,health-conscious, and family-values oriented, you might feel out-of-place. Much of the lobby crowd were later middle-aged people who were intoxicated. A man and woman at the table next to us made very loud and drunken in off-color remarks that were not witty like those of the Round Table Literary group, but instead vulgar and offensive. We concluded that this is not a place to have dinner with children or teenagers, or for those who prefer proper decorum. The concierge I encountered in March 2007 was rude, incompetent, and coarse. She represented the opposite of the legendary Algonquin service and manners. She obviously did not want to help with directions. The rooms and bathrooms are miniscule compared to other hotels of comparable price in NYC. All that this hotel has to offer on a competitive basis is its history and aspirations to the legendary service it touts. The management really needs to rethink its full utilization of the hotel's history -- changing its approach from exploitation to respect. And they need to retrain the hotel's waitstaff and find a new concierge. This is a three-star hotel that is best suited to an older neo-con crowd that likes to drink; writers who are drawn to the history and don't mind the chasm between the hotel's past liberal literary glory days and its present; and people who don't mind the well-worn rooms and problems because they got a promotional \"bargain.\" The rooms are not worth the full price -- there's much better in the vicinity. Although I was drawn to the hotel's literary history, in the end the cons outweighed the pros. I switched to a hotel in the area that was in the same (non-promotional) price range but was truly luxurious (4-diamond), with a staff with consistent good manners. There's a reason for the wildly varying opinions at Trip Advisor. Recommend reading them carefully to see if you fall into the kind of category that fits with this hotel. It's NOT for everyone. At the same time, I hope the management gets their act together, removes \"The Sun\" from their lobby, and revives some of the past consistent greatness of the Algonquin, which is still alive there, in the friendly and wonderful personalities of the gentlemen at the door and bellservice. I wish them the best because they deserve it. They make the hotel along with the architecture and history.

The first thing the venerable Algonquin has is: Location. And then there's location. Really. We were able to speedwalk after running late to make it to our chosen play (Spamalot - see it, it's great). At the end of each sight seeing day, there were great restaurants, more to do, things to see, Times Square - and the ever-welcoming bellman and front desk staff. They really did recognize us, coming and going, our cab was waiting almost before we were out the door. I think we waited, once, for about 40 seconds for a cab. There's even an actual breakfast cafe very close to the hotel. There are excellent carryout deli-style places on 5th and 6th, a little further of a walk than we Californians are used to, but the entire area is so safe, and you catch glimpses of the Empire State Building as you proceed - it's perfect. So many things are truly within walking distance. We were checked in quickly, the staff was friendly but not intrusive. We loved Mathilda, the cat, really helped make us feel at home. The lobby attracts tourists, business people, and people in town to meet friends - all of them well dressed but not trendy, a mix of sophistication and hominess there, too. Our room was small, as we expected, but not as small as some in New York. It lacked the window seat that you see in their stock photo - and that extra 10 sf or so that is in that picture. It didn't matter. We looked out onto the backside of some office building - we could watch these fellows dealing on the phones all day long - or not. Our air conditioning worked great, was quiet. We were on the backside of the hotel, obviously - but it was very quiet and I'm a very light sleeper. The closet was adequate, I was surprised. The desk was very close to the bed, but that was okay - and it was ample to use as a dressing table. There were a couple of extra electrical outlets, we didn't have to struggle over that. Internet worked greated. I loved the little bathroom - shiny Art Deco style porcelain fixture (brand new Kohler), great faucets, beautiful shelving, great shower, soaking tub was spotless and filled quickly with really hot water. Subway tile, a tiny window - but good light. TV was in an armoire inset into the wall, perfectly sized from our point of view (who watches TV in NYC anyway?) The halls are papered with New Yorker cartoons, I'm a great fan of Dorothy Parker and the New Yorker, so if I was bored or having insomnia, I wandered around and read the cartoons. The suites looked fab., wished we could have had one. Room service was fine - one time they forgot our morning coffee and we had to call a couple of times (it was expensive to get a small pot, but there's no Starbucks or coffee stand close by - and no coffee service in the rooms, which I totally understand - I don't really like making my own in-room coffee anyway). The coffee was great and we splurged on lox several times too (not too expensive, compared to the coffee). The time they brought the coffee late they were very apologetic. All recommendations about dining made by the staff were great - although we soon discovered that over on 46th Street there were a series of great Brazilian (and some Cuban) restaurants - with such varied menus and great service that we kept going back. We walked to the guitar stores, we walked through the jewelry mart, we bought rare (to us) sheet music, all on the way to dinner. Ah, it was fun. We never worried about whether we'd get to the airport on time - we knew they'd have a cab for us, and somehow, having the doorman check out the cabby and tell him our destination each time made me feel secure. Not that I ever felt really insecure in that neighborhood, day or night. It's three short blocks from Grand Central (and a couple short blocks more to the Waldorf, if you want true grandiosity). We smiled (laughed) at the people ensconced in the relative sterility of the Harvard Club, just down the block, wondered why so many people stayed at the Royalton across the street (bigger, more modern), and thought the Iroquois was very similar in looks, but perhaps not in service, to our Algonquin. We're planning another trip and we'd of course like to have variety in our life - but the Algonquin was so cool, we are having a hard time thinking about staying anywhere else. We loved walking to Bryant Park, and we never even made it through the doors of the NY Public Library - one block away. We went to the Bryant Park Hotel for cocktails - if you want clubbing and hiphoppers (P Diddy was there in the private room - with layers of bouncers too) that's just two blocks away. The furnishings throughout the hotel are of a type that appeals to me - warm colors, cozy, and you don't feel afraid to touch or move around. We visited several other hotels, just for fun (or to get a break from some unseasonable heat) - but none of them felt like home, like the Algonquin did, from the minute we got there. Are there downsides? Well, we thought next time we'd take an extra piece of luggage to hold bottled water, a couple of bottles of wine, some snacks - there's no place really close by to buy those things. There's no in-room fridge, and we can't now remember if there was an ice machine at all - there must have been, but not on our floor. The hotel-provided shampoos etc. are great.", "Date": "February 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "Title": "\u201cSmall Treasure, The Algonquin\u201d", "Author": "CarolCPhiladelphia", "ReviewID": "UR6778124", "Content": "Found this hotel on Expedia.

Firstly, they claimed on their website that they had done renovations to the hotel, which from what I could tell only including slapping up plasma TVs on the walls and calling it a day. The rooms are abominable-dirty furniture, 19th century plumbing and ancient, broken climate controls. Secondly, the charm of this \"luxury\" hotel lies with the \"Algonquin round table\" where legendary authors gathered and talked literature. This \"round table\" room has possibly the most dreadful food I have experienced in New York. The french onion soup was burnt and the hamburger raw. Thirdly, the mystic of the hotel lies with it's purported impeccable service. Well apparently, service involves a collection of untrained pseudoadolescents who apparently have been mistaken for hotel management/workers. The young girl who greeted me on arrival couldn't find my reservation and then proceeded to ask me if I was actually at the right hotel. Considering I had arrived late-(don't make that mistake-you will end up in one their unsued rooms that they keep for emergencies-translate \"unused\" as dirty and in poor repair) and had called ahead to let the hotel know, I was very concerned that this smarmy prepubescent couldn't find my reservation. Fourthly, when I called repeatedly (three times in one night) to report the complete disrepair of the air conditioning/climate control, I was told that this was my fault-apparently allowing guests to control their own climate control is unacceptable-and that the unit was frozen up and could not be repaired. Yet, this brought no rectification of the matter. I then attempted to open the windows in the room and was reprimanded by staff that this was not allowed. I left as soon as I could and booked another hotel on the same street. Interestingly, after I submitted a dispute for the charges from the Algonquin to my credit card, the Algonquin Hotel offered me two free nights in one of their suites.

I stay here whenever I'm in New York and I'm always happy that I did, although it is NOT CHEAP. The staff is friendly and helpful and it's small and intimate rather than huge and corporate. (There's even a lovely hotel cat...) The location is ideal --an easy walk to the theatres and to MOMA. The decor is self-consciously historical, with endless references to its 1920s Round Table heyday -- including the New Yorker cartoon-themed wall paper in the hallways and the large portrait of Benchly, Parker, Wolcott& crew in the dining room. Overall, the tone is classic rather than contemporary (plenty of wood and very little plastic) although there are the modern amenities you expect at this price range -- internet access and flat screen televisions. The rooms are lovely (high ceilings with moldings) and immaculate and the beds are INCREDIBLY COMFORTABLE. There's a lovely knitted wool blanket at the foot of each.. (The views aren't much to speak of, but the window treatments are lovely.) Actually the rooms are so pleasant it's tempting to spend a lot of time loafing around the room. Each room has character and good art on the walls, a wood desk and lamps with good reading light. And very comfy plush terry cloth robes are provided for your loafing pleasure. The water is always hot enough and the water pressure is always terrific. What the Algonquin lacks is coffee and ice. There is NO ICE in the room and none available unless you phone the desk and ask for it to be brought to the room. This is silly and inconvenient. Even worse, for me, there is NO MORNING COFFEE AVAILABLE unless, again, you want to pay a fortune to get a small (for me) pot brought up to your room. There should be either in-the-room coffee makers or complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning. Or both! (There are two Starbucks within a few blocks. and the restaurant next door, The Red Flame, is a good place to get a reasonably priced and more than adequate breakfast.) Other observations: Check in is always a breeze. I always request early check in and so far a room has always been available when I get there at mid day. Some rooms are quieter than others and some rooms are smaller than others. There are NO KING SIZE BEDS. Only twins and queens. The lobby/bar is TO DIE FOR. A great atmospheric place for a nightcap. (although often noisy with the babble of many happy drinkers socializing.) Very pricey but delicious drinks and the on-the-table munchies are addictively delicious.. On my last stay, the room -- Room 416 -- was lovely but TINY (and noisy -- there was a constant blowing sound from what I guess was a neighboring building's exhaust system, as well as the occasional whistle of the doorman summoning a taxi) (my advice: ask for a higher floor) and the bathroom was even smaller (If I weren't slim, I wouldn't have been able to fit into the shower.) The room was chilly and the heater didn't work. The front desk was very responsive -- they sent up two different engineers within moments to try to fix the problem and then, when they couldn't fix it, offered me another room or the use of a space heater. Because I needed two beds, and no other two bed room was available, I went with the space heater.) Making a two minute long distance call from the room cost me $10!

I loved the historic but yet very tidy nature of the hotel. Most everything was in great condition and very clean. The lobby and lounge area are just beautiful. The compact nature of the hotel makes it easy to come and go very efficiently. The rooms are small by midwest standards but that was not a problem for me. I wasn't spending much time in the room and I was by myself. Two small or moderate sized people could share a room without feeling too cramped. The bathrooms are quite small but again that was not a problem for me. There was no tub, just a stand up shower. The bathroom had the old honeycomb style floor and was updated in historic style. The shower floor appears to be the only thing that has not been updated, it was quite worn but that did not detract from my stay. The furniture and decor in the room were very nice. If you a light sleeper,in terms of needing complete darkness, the room I stayed in and perhaps others may not be right for you. The window treatments were white fabric blinds that were pretty sheer in terms of letting light in and there were no curtains that you could close. The curtains were only decorative to cover the outline of the window. At night the streetlights showed through the blinds and lit up the very small room to the point I had trouble getting to sleep. It would be better if they had a curtain you could unhook and pull over to cover the blinds. The hotel staff were very cordial. Breakfast is expensive at the hotel. For a bowl of cream of wheat, a glass of milk, and two pieces of thick frend toast, the cost was about $30 with tip. There is a nice diner next door where you can grab breakfast for much less. Au Bon Pain is a few blocks away toward Grand Central Station, that is a very reasonable place to get breakfast or lunch. The hotel is convenient to nearly everything in midtown and very convenient to the subways and Grand Central Station. I highly recommend it for folks that want easy access to their hotel room throughout the day to take a nap or just rest a while. I also highly recommend it for the elderly. The fact the rooms are so compact makes it less tiring to get from place to place in the room. It's also a short cab ride to the theatres for those that can't walk several blocks.

They don't rush you along and the atmosphere is completely relaxing. I love their speciality napkins. On special occasions I even stop for a drink there after the theatre even if I'm not staying the night. The Oak Room is a wonderful experience, although i have never eaten there only attended the cabaret. Once when we were running late for the show they held the closing of the door for our party. The rooms are a little on the small side for American hotel rooms but they are beautifully appointed and it's New York City how much time are spending in your room. The bathrooms are elegant and I love the New Yorker shower curtains. I also like how the hotel embraces its historical signifigance with the New Yorker wallpaper and the round table quotes on all the room doors. The suites are wonderful options as are the twin rooms especially for a family with grown siblings. Together with the location the Algonguin is an incredible oasis in the city that still allows you to be a part of the energy of New York but stepping out of its doors.

Having travelled a fair amount for both work and pleasure, I have very high standards as far as hotels go. This was an exceptionally busy time of year for tourism in NYC, so I searched for a long time to find a good deal for a hotel in the midtown Manhattan area. I was thrilled to find a room at the Algonquin on Quikbook for well below the rates available on Orbitz, Expedia, and other discount sites. The location is terrific--on 44th Street between 5th Avenue and Avenue of the Americas. Other hotels on the block are the Iroquois and Sofitel. It's within easy walking distance of Times Square and the theaters, plus Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, and Central Park. Check-in was very prompt and pleasant. I was shown to my room, which was quite small--no exaggeration here. Nevertheless, it felt classy. I had no view, but my room was exceptionally quiet and serene. I found it totally insulated me from the pace and heat of the city outside. The bathroom is a reasonable size, with marble countertops and nice Gilchrist and Soames bath products. The bath towels were nice and very large (although not terribly soft). Robes were provided, as was an ironing board and safe. The hotel provides both free wireless internet plus wired high-speed internet for $9.95/day. The bed was exceptionally comfortable--It was soft and luxurious, and I slept exceptionally well. Both feather and firmer pillows were provided. The TV was small but functional. There was no minibar in my room, nor do I recall there being a soda or ice machine on the floor, but I didn't look. The major drawbacks during my stay were (1) the size of the room--it was fine for me travelling alone, but it would have felt cramped had my wife been there as well; (2) lukewarm showers on several occasions. This was my biggest issue. I like a hot shower--I mean a REALLY hot shower. I really only had one shower during my stay that came close to meeting that criterion. While my showers weren't cold by any means, a hotel of this caliber needs to provide hot water for its guests on demand. These drawbacks were overcome by (1) location; (2) comfort and serenity; (3) price; and (4) service--the bell staff in particular were exceptionally friendly and helpful in all regards. I sent dry cleaning out twice, and they handled that flawlessly. They also provided excellent restaurant recommendations and made sure that all of my needs were met. They made up for the front desk staff who were professional but not as solicitous. The hotel provided me with a late checkout, which helped me time my trip to the airport on my way out of town. I think you will find the Algonquin to provide a very nice experience on your trip to NYC. It is a classy, historic hotel that has been nicely updated. You'll be especially happy if you can get a rate well below that of nearby 4-star hotels.

The location is perfect for the typical NYC tourist, particularly if you are attending theater; very central, in a safe area, and on a relatively quiet yet central block. The lobby is small and elegant, with original dark wood panelling. Many people stop by for afternoon and evening drinks at the Algonquin even if they aren't staying there or are local--it is a lovely spot. (While most people were dressed well while having a drink, it fine to sit for tea in your jeans after touristing around. We did.) The food in the restaurant is good (we ate breakfasts and pizza there ), though not inexpensive....but not royally outrageous either. A full breakfast (many choices) of eggs, french toast, or pastries, rolls, etc,, with fruit and juice and coffee, etc is $17 I think.

The hallways are like they were originally--fairly narrow, with panelling. All of us noted that if you need to take the stairs down to the restroom in the lobby, you had better not be obese--it is extremely narrow. These things, to us, all added to the charm of the hotel. It is more like a nice European small hotel, with character and individuality. My kids liked it. True, they have travelled to Europe a few times and stayed in small hotels or country houses, so they find charm in originality, but I think many would.

However, I don't go to a hotel to hang out with the other hotel guests and the nightcap we had Saturday night in the lounge area was perfect nice as we could actually hear each other talk! * Location is perfect - just a couple blocks or so from Times Square. * The one detraction from all this excellent was the lack of coffee in the room or the lobby area. I can understand not having it in the room as space is somewhat at a premium, but nothing in the lobby that you can take back to your room either? That's just unacceptable. Your options were to sit down in the restaurant and have a cup there (not something I want to do when I've just woken up), order room service ($$$$) or walk a couple of blocks to Starbucks and bring it back. I ended up going to Starbucks but was not very happy about it. Hopefully they will change this practice and set up a morning coffee/tea bar in the lobby. When you're paying this much for a room, I think that's the least they can do. * Overall, I absolutely loved this hotel and would return in a heartbeat...I'd just be prepared for the morning coffee hike!", "Date": "October 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cClassy, central and a bit stuffy\u201d", "Author": "Paul67", "ReviewID": "UR3995033", "Content": "Stayed at the Algonquin for 3 nights in September for my first time in NYC.

We both live here in New York so we are well aware of the \"average\" Manhattan hotel room. It was nice because I didn't have to do any of the planning or review reading or anything. The Algonquin is a historic hotel with a great look and a perfect location for tourists. We wre in room 407. (Remember this if you want to avoid a view that will make you keep the blinds closed tightly.) Upon entering the hotel, attentive doormen opended the doors, the desk staff greeted us each time we came and went and the resident feline, Matilda, was usually somewhere nearby. (Beautiful cat but not very social lol) There are 2 elevators, a large lounge with dark wood furnishings and dim lighting. There is also a library that you can borrow books from and they place a couple books and magzines in the rooms as well. The Room I really liked our room. By Manhattan standards, it was not cramped and was a square room rather than rectangular like many are. The original architecture really adds a cozy charm and the walls are cream with white moulding. The textiles are shades of deep reds, golds and greens with traditional dark wood furnishings. I'm not a big fan of the \"traditional\" look, but here it was balanced nicely and the room didn't feel old at all. The bed---ahhhhh, the bed. So comfortable. Pillowtop Queen size mattress complete with Egyptian Cotton linen, a lightweight down-type topper, a mixed batch of pillows including down and synthetic, and a throw at the bottom of the bed that nicely coordinated with the carpeting, drapes and bedskirt. There are 2 chairs in the room, both nicely upholstered. An arm chair and a desk chair at the writing desk. In the desk drawer is a nice selection of stationery including post cards, all neatly arranged in a folder. There is a nice closet with a safe, iron and ironing board and plush bath robe behind a solid wood door.(There was only one though. We didn't ask for a second but I would think there should have been two.) The TV was only 20\" I think, but I didn't mind. It's housed in a wood armoire on top of which is your tray with ice bucket, glasses and a dish of candies. Beneath are drawers and there are also drawers in each nightstand and the desk. The bathroom is spacious but the bathtub is of the smaller hotel-size variety. The toilet is taller than the standard household toilet. There are nice bathroom amenities including shower gel, lotion, shampoo and conditoner, a shoe shine, shower cap and mini shower cap and hair dryer. There is a full-length mirror on the bathroom door. The shower has a nice handheld, highly polished shower wand. I saw no signs of aging or wear in the room. Everything was very clean..except the top of the armoire, which was in need of dusting. The hotel does have room service, but we did not order anything. Expect higher than usual pricing. You have to get ice from room service, which I found odd. We got ice at the front desk instead. The room is very cozy, it feels like a bedroom. The ceiling fan adds a nice touch and the A/C is very adequate. The carpet and bathroom floor was clean and we never heard any noises inside our room from other guests/staff. The reasons I did not give The Algonquin 5 stars are: No pool No continental breakfast Terrible view from our room All very minor details since these are very common problems with Manhattan hotels.", "Date": "August 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cPleasant (but not perfect) stay ...

The elevators are tiny and have funky buttons. There is an open staircase from top to bottom of the building. The halls have New Yorker cartoon wallpaper. The room doors are original, solid, heavy wood. The bedrooms are small, but so very solid and well-designed, and now clean and light, that our room ranks among my favorite of all hotel rooms. Our window was on an airshaft, which gave me entertaining views of about 20 office workers across the way in the daytime. Our room was quieter than any other city hotel room I've had, and certainly quieter than any new construction hotel. A room fronting on 44th Street would doubtless be louder. I had the impression that the hotel staff is making a big effort. The place is much cleaner than I remember.

Because it is most decidedly not a chain hotel, not a formula, and it's not for you if your prefer that. It is a gem of a friendly place chock full of history, and the recent renovation is more than enough to make it fastidiously clean and comfortable. The fast Internet connection should be free, but like most Manhattan hotels it's about $10 a day. The water pressure is very good, the bathrooms excellent, the towels first rate. The beds, pillows and sheets are the equal or better of the Heavenly Bed at the W -- very high thread count. Flat, thin-panel televisions in every room. Sure, the two elevators could use some help, but how many hotels have a resident feline that works the front desk? Room service is very good. New York Times, Observer and USA Today are free every day. The location is very convenient, and when you can get a good rate here it's worth a stay for the high value it provides by comparison with some high-priced competition in the neighborhood: Royalton, Iroquois, City Club, Millenium, W, Marriott, Hilton, Renaissance, etc.", "Date": "February 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cStay here only in a pinch\u201d", "Author": "Canadianknowitall", "ReviewID": "UR3045867", "Content": "I have stayed at the Algonquin on and off for the last thirty years and can honestly say that it really IS coasting on a long and very past reputation. Whatever vestiges of the original charm,such as the tiny little bar to the right as one entered, have long gone in previous \"refurbishments\" and into history. She is like the old matron that has had one facelift too many.No matter how much you do to her, she's never going to fool anyone about the fact that she's had a lot of work done to her and in turn make her eventually look even older and more pathetic. This trip we were given room 611 overlooking 44th Street. Physically the room was beautifully re-decorated but so small (as all the rooms have always been) you needed to leave it to change your mind. Somehow they managed to squish in twin beds in it however and these beds were exquisitely comfortable... if one were able to get any sleep in them. We woke up to single digit freezing temperatures as we had shut off the very noisy heater before going to sleep. Problem was it wouldn't heat when started up again. We called front desk and within minutes a maintenance man came in to fix it. All fine and dandy however forget about getting anymore sleep with it on. Also the noise from the street is very intrusive even with all the windows tightly shut. I'm amazed at the poor soundproofing seeing the hotel was recently refurbished. The bathroom configuration was awkward with virtually no space for one's own toiletries. Some call it old world charming, I call it tiresome and badly planned . The staff were blandly pleasant and neither aided or abetted our stay. Having learnt long ago to avoid the ridiculous prices of the drinks and so-so food at the Algonquin, (The Red Flame diner is right next door to the hotel and is where EVERYONE goes for an excellent breakfast at more than half the price of a hotel one) we nevertheless were happy that we had only paid a very low Internet rate.It certainly is not worth more.", "Date": "January 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDorothy Parker Would Expect No Less\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2975584", "Content": "Okay, if you're going to be near Times Square which is good because of your proximity to both sides of town and both train stations, why not be in one of the most famous hotels in the world? It's worth it and you won't find many rooms like this in NYC. The beds are extremely warm and cozy, the art on the walls all tell tales of the history of the hotel from illustrations depicting the originators of The Atlantic Monthly to hand-written poetry of Dorothy Parker to letters to his editor by Truman Capote. The bathrooms are deep, the water warm, it really has everything you need including vintage old NYC furniture that is comfortable and in unbelievably good condition. And to think you are only a few floors above The Round Table... to be so close to a round surface with simple wooden legs that at one time hosted the liveliest, most important and humorous ongoing literary dialogues in the world. If you have a large enough group, you can actually reserve that table! Positively remarkable considering this piece of furniture should be stored in The Smithsonian. One drawback: some of the help. There are the nice men and women who are the waiters and the maids. We decided some of the waiters were straight out of New Yorker cartoons. And you can't help but get the feeling most of the help has been there since 1934 and still get a kick out of each other and their job. They're not the problem. It's some of the unpleasant and/or inefficient characters at the Front Desk. Though one or two were friendly and helpful, most were snobby and seemed put upon -- as though they had better things to do. And while the day concierge was sweet as all get out, he did not, as promised, provide me with a special store he and I had a lengthy conversation about. A slightly less inocuous example of poor behavior occured when I explained to the current Front Desk man that the man from the previous evening promised me a great rate for the following night *which he truly had. The man at the Front Desk smirked, barely looked me in the eye, and said he didn't know why that happened, that gentleman shouldn't have promised me that and he couldn't help me. Then he went about his business as I stood there. At the moment, if I hadn't liked others in the hotel as much and the room, I would have asked he move my stuff out and I get my money back. His manner was postively rude and discourteous. Perhaps he was correct, his colleague should have made no such promises, and perhaps I should have taken up his colleague's offer when he put it out there, but this charming man could have handled it without being so disgustingly unpleasant. I was further underwhelmed when I discovered I had lost a piece of jewelry. Once having discovered the loss on my way to another location, I phoned the Front Desk to explain what I had missing. But after that call, no one got back to me, and it was a family heirloom. I phoned the hotel to find out about the follow up and had many short conversations that seemed perfunctory with the front desk pleading they check again with Security. But neither they nor their Security Officer has bothered to phone me to this day. Honestly, even if it were to simply say, \"Miss, we've interviewed everyone, there's nothing we can do. We are so sorry,\" I would have been disappointed but felt the proper attention had been paid. Instead I am left angry and disenchanted. Granted I was there during the holidays and no one wants to work during that time, but as long as they're there and I'm there and we are all there together, I think they could have bent over backwards or sideways or bent their bodies upwards to look me in the eyes, so as to make my stay more pleasant and prevent such a complex review. These to me though are luxurious problems. It's not like I would call downstairs, ask for tea and it wouldn't arrive within ten minutes (although everything cost a buttload -- watch out for the costs. One one minute phone call to LA cost me ten dollars). There were many moments of excellent hospitality. And regardless of my specific disparaging remarks, The Algonquin is a charming, beautiful, comfortable hotel in a good location. Just bring a little attitude in your bag so when necessary, you can throw it back to Mr. Charming Pants at the Front Desk. Dorothy Parker would expect no less. p.s. If you make ressies on line, be careful you are not quoted one rate for one evening and another rate for another evening. I got stung that way and insisted, prior to checking in, it be changed at once. They did so, which was helpful, but keep your eye on the ball. I'm positive this is common practice amongst many hotels but it's an odd practice and the ethics of which I question.", "Date": "January 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Tx", "Title": "\u201cLiving on past reputation\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2974490", "Content": "My group occupied three rooms for four nights over the New Year's Eve weekend. The location of the the hotel is wonderful. There is easy access to Times Square, the theater district, Rockefeller Center and shopping on 5th Ave. The staff was quite pleasant and helpful. I was very disappointed in the size of the rooms and the bathrooms. They say on other websites that they offer rollaway beds, but even they will tell you if you call that there is not room for one in the room. Even though they just finished an extensive renovation, things still seem, well, cramped and dated. Our rooms were on three different floors and none had a view of anything but rooftop and ventilation units. The beds are quite comfortable and our rooms were quiet. I think this hotel is trying to live on the reputation of being a gathering place for long-dead famous writers many years ago. I'm all for historical significance, but it doesn't make for comfortable accomodations.

Since we enjoyed reading these reviews prior to our trip, I thought I would reciprocate. We were in NYC the week prior to Christmas, a great time to be in the City. First and foremost, the Algonquin is the antithesis of the big-chain, homogenous hotel. It is a relatively small, cozy inn where the traveler is made to feel welcome and at home. All of the staff were very friendly and outgoing. We engaged several of them in lengthy conversations, especially Raul (I'm certain I have misspelled his name), the food and beverage manager. As others before me have noted, it was a pleasure to duck into the relaxing lobby of the Algonquin a long day. The hotel is conveniently located and is within easy walking distance of several well-known attractions - Times Square, Empire State Building, 5th Avenue, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Radio City, etc. There are also two subway stations within a few blocks which made other destinations within the city accessible. Our room (708) was fairly small but was clean and very comfortable. Since the room itself was somewhat tight, the lobby bar became our hangout - plenty of tables and chairs, good food and beverages, newspapers, and high-speed wireless internet service. My only critical observation would be the price of food and beverages in the lobby bar. I may have paid more for bottled beer ($7) or a simple coctail ($14) but I don't remember when. All in all, the Algonquin was a very enjoyable stay.
