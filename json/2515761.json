The first thing I noticed after checking in was that their room keys were old motel-like keys (believe it or not this has a lot to say about this hotel because a MOTEL is exactly what it ended up being). The walk to our room was amazing (tons of flowers, palm trees, and plants, it almost felt like a secret garden maze). However, once in the room, it set in that this place was like a cheap motel with good landscaping. The room itself was pretty big for two adults and one child and was also pretty clean for the most part. The equipment however (ac unit, shower head, t.v., etc...) were very old. The worst part though was how filthy the carpets were (black feet immediately). Overall it was not a bad room if you need to stay a night or 2 max but any longer than that I would definitely suggest an actual hotel. This place is definitely NOT family friendly. Although no one bothered us during our stay and we got luck enough to have a room away from all of the noise, the vast majority of people who were staying at this location were lower class. Also, their breakfast is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING compared to what their picture shows. I have been on vacation in the midwest part of the United States for about 1 month now and this hotel had the worst breakfast I have encountered during my travels. Please do not stay here especially if you have children. Oh and one more thing. I noticed a review about a year or so ago said that during their stay, this hotel said free internet coming soon so I need to add that their prices are still the same for internet today, such an inconveinience for such a crappy place. I don't know San Diego at all but it seems like this hotel is in a bad part of town. I hope this review helps any one to not make the same mistake we made (we have now switched hotels and are soooo much more comfortable).", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cGood place to stay if your on a budget but...\u201d", "Author": "Claire M", "ReviewID": "UR123679737", "Content": "With this motel you get what you pay for but I wouldn't suggest it for anyone travelling alone although the entrances are gated and they have a secruity person on duty after 11pm.

My wife found a moth in the middle of the night right next to her head. 3. The first night we stayed, loud neighbors woke us up around 1:00 am.

The breakfast room was closed on the second day since there was some problem with the water supply / wash basin in the kitchen. 5.

California Suites was by far the only place in the area that met both criteria. Although there were also some critical comments about unkempt rooms, they only made up a small handful of the reviews. The most common complaint I read in the reviews were about the \u201clong-term\u201d guests who lived in many of the units. Not wasting any time I made the reservation and felt comfortable with my chances. Pulling into the motel, one will notice that it is right off a major street (parking lot back right into the street) and it is surrounded by strip malls, an apartment complex and a gas station/convenient store. The surrounding area is not at all inviting, but was conveniently located and did provide for some good dining options nearby. The establishment itself was presentable\u2014though it looked a little tired, (think late 1960\u2019s apartment complex)\u2014however the pleasant front desk service put me at ease. Before I got to the room I started thinking about the reviews regarding the \u201clong-term\u201d guests and soon thereafter I started to notice many patrons who fit the mold. As I walked past the pool I did notice a group of young adults in the Jacuzzi conversing loudly while blaring 90s rock music from a radio played in the background (fortunately my room was on the opposite side of the pool). However despite those characters I did not feel threatened\u2014just a little uncomfortable (as if I was a stranger stepping into someone else\u2019s home). But of course the real testament is the condition of the room, which I found to be in great condition: extremely clean, spacious and enough toiletries to last me during my stay. It appears that this motel was once an apartment complex\u2014one thing that made me think so is the larger than average kitchenette with many pantries and drawers. The only drawback to the room (though it didn\u2019t matter to me) is the outdate furnishings. Despite all the flaws I still would stay here again for that same price. However if the rate ever goes beyond $75/night I am not so sure it would be worth it.

A few things to be aware of if you will be checking in late at night: The cancellation policy says that if you cancel your reservation within 24 hours, you'll be charged for the first night. If you don't arrive until after 9-10pm on the first day of your reservation (or, say, 1am that night, like we did), you will automatically be charged for the first night (on the card you reserved the room with, regardless of what you pay with). Upon your (late night) arrival, you will also pay for the full hotel stay (including the first night again). The fee that was charged to your account for failing to arrive before 9pm will then be refunded, but (depending on your bank) it might not make it back into your account immediately, so if you were counting on that money being in your account, it's something to take into consideration. Also, that late, the parking lot fills up quickly and good luck getting anything larger than a compact into the carport areas. The pros: The landscaping is extremely pretty. Flowers and benches and walkways everywhere. The pool was clean, lighted, and warm. We didn't test out the hot tub, but there were several people in it. There is a microwave, stovetop, and mini-fridge (that was very cold) in the room, as well as two closets (one large and one small), an iron and ironing board, and several shelves in the large closet. We didn't hear any noise at night, but our room was near the stairs (of which there are several; no elevator that I saw), and people were extremely noisy starting around 7:30am. The girl at the night desk was very friendly and efficient, and the woman at check-out was the same. The cons: The hotel room is tiny. We are a family of five and while I expected it to be small, the room was exceedingly cramped. We brought a pot to boil water and it took over half an hour for the water to get up to a boil. That was somewhat annoying. The second night we found that if we started out with hot water, it took about half the time. The air conditioning was pretty ineffectual unless you let it run all day while you were gone, and our first night was unbearable as the room was too hot to sleep and didn't cool down until it was time to get up. The pillows were awful - bring your own (unless you enjoy lumpy bits of disjointed stuffing thrown into a pillow case!). There's no fan in the bathroom (there is a window), so it gets extremely hot and wet in the room while showering. The shower has amazing water pressure - it's really strong - but it nearly takes your face off and there's no way to change that (I listed this as a con because while my husband loved it, it wasn't great for washing the kids). The carpet was disgusting; prepare to wear shoes at all times while in the room or leave gross, black footprints on the bath mat when you go in to take a shower (ew!). And $6.95/night or $19.95/week for wired internet (\"wireless internet coming soon!\") - not a huge fan. Neutral: As stated in several other reviews (which I read before going), there are long term residents living in the hotel, but other than encountering a few doing their laundry on the way to the pool, we didn't really notice them. There is a continental breakfast that I didn't bother to wake up for. Husband says it was fruit, coffee, toast, and mini-muffins. He brought me back a banana. Other than the carpet, the room was clean but worn; the counters, closets, and bathroom were clean. The bedspread was a bit stained when I pulled it down, so we just took them off completely and used the blankets underneath. The bed was bouncy and not the most comfortable, but not awful (husband hated it, too). You're only given three towels (again, family of five; that was fun), but we didn't try to ask for more, so maybe that would've worked. The tv is tiny, but we were on vacation and didn't spend much time in the room, so that wasn't terribly important to us. There is a locked gate you have to go through to get to the rooms (you're given a key to the room and a key to the gate/pool). The back parking lot is locked until 5am and there appeared to be a security guard patrolling the grounds when we arrived the first night. Overall: I probably would not stay here again. The convenience of having a stovetop and fridge in the room was excellent, but it wasn't worth the headache of cramming so many people into such a small, confined space with inadequate air conditioning and no ventilation. If you need a quick, overnight stop, it's not bad, but I wouldn't try staying with more than two people for an extended period of time.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cExtraordinary, caring service\u201d", "Author": "Interjerry", "ReviewID": "UR115402827", "Content": "My brother and I stayed at the California Suites, primarily because of its good reviews, very reasonable prices and proximity to the University of California San Diego Hospital, where my brother had a scheduled and very serious operation.

Customer Service: When we checked in we were met by two young adult staff members who were clearly more interested in continuing their conversation about their \u2018arduous\u2019 working conditions than actually greeting and checking in guests. After listening to their conversation for 3 to 5 minutes, I had to interject \u201ccould we just focus on checking my family into the hotel\u201d. Of course my request was met with rolled eyes and contempt. But at least they started to focus.

No: Have a nice day, thanks for staying with us, please come again etc. wow. Continental almost breakfast: You have 3 bulk cereal choices \u2013 flakes, raisin bran thing and \u2018cheerios\u2019. Drinks Choices: Milk, Orange Juice, Cranberry Juice, Coffee/Decaf, 2 flavored coffees are all available Sometimes! Usually, except for milk, at least 3 of the above were out of stock so you really only have 2 to 3 choices. Pastries: None Mini muffins were available when the staff member decided to restock the basket. Breads: Just bagels sometimes but we had white bread available everyday. The staff member just stands behind her tip jar watching people not really stocking or cleaning. In fact, a mini muffin was left on a dining table over night and was still there the next morning when we returned. Fruit: 1st day Bananas, 2nd day Oranges 3rd day Oranges. We had to ask the staff to fill the fruit basket 2 out of three days. Accommodations: Think OLD None Branded Hotel. Not disgusting but dingy. AC Unit had the direction fins completely broken out and removed \u2013 yes just a large Gapping hole blowing air. Light and electrical (AC) work like some weird combination of light switches and knobs. 1st to turn on kitchen light, flip light near TV 10 feet away then walk into kitchen and flip that knob etc. Rooms are suppose to be no smoking \u2013 we had to sign stuff and pink swear not to smoke in the rooms but are room reeked of when we first entered.

We found all of this and more in the California Suites Hotel! Our exceptional service started the day before our stay. I called in advance and asked for an upstairs room because I am a light sleeper. The woman who took my call (I believe she was the manager), said \"oh, I'll make sure I find you a very quiet room. I'm going to re-read your request to myself today and again tomorrow so I don't forget.\" She did not disappoint. We did not arrive until midnight, and I was concerned that maybe we'd be assigned some crummy, leftover room, but she had reserved one specifically for us, in an out-of-the-way corner of the hotel, away from stairways and parking, and with little foot traffic. Our room was PERFECTLY quiet. We slept completely undisturbed and were so grateful for her consideration. I called the front desk the next day to ask a question and the same woman answered. She remembered me and asked if our room was quiet enough for us. Her attention to detail was impressive. The room itself was just darling. It was quite literally, one of the cleanest hotel rooms I've ever stayed in. The bathroom fixtures were SPARKLING. The linens were clean. The grout on the floor in the bathroom was clean. We didn't see dust or cobwebs, even in the out-of-the-way nooks and crannies. The fridge and microwave were both clean. The carpet was clean. I even felt comfortable enough to walk bare-footed in the room, which I never do in a hotel. I noticed the same cleanliness around the hotel grounds. Every day I observed maintenance personnel cleaning the pool furniture, the pool deck, the trashcans, the railings, spills on the sidewalk, and various other high-traffic and/or high-dirt areas. The pool and jacuzzi were both sparkling clean and maintained at pleasant temperatures. The room was very comfortable. The beds were comfortable, the carpet was plush, the water pressure in the shower was nice, the walls were thick (we only heard our neighbors when our window was open), there was ample lighting, ample closet space, and room to move around. The decor and fixtures were definitely outdated, but were clean and in good repair. The television worked and offered a nice selection of channels. Internet is not free, but can be purchased. We chose not to purchase it so we cannot comment on its performance. Parking is free and relatively easy to come by, and our vehicle was safe. The staff is just wonderful. Several times we had a question about how to get somewhere or where to eat, and they were always helpful and friendly, and when they didn't know the answer to our question, they were honest in telling us they did not know, instead of sending us on a wild goose chase. The surrounding area is older, but safe and clean. To the west of the hotel lies a gas station and lower-end apartments. Across the street is a small shopping center with little restaurants and shops. A similar shopping center lies to the east of the property. Behind the property is a high school and a residential neighborhood. The hotel is located very close to the 805 freeway, but not so close that your stay is impacted by traffic and freeway noise. A couple of times we walked to neighboring businesses, and never felt unsafe, including after dark. We had a few complaints, but they were minor. Two of our four days, we did not have hot water in the shower. Apparently, they developed some sort of problem with the boiler while we were there. But both days, when we called maintenance, the problem was addressed immediately, to the best of their ability, and cheerfully. The breakfast is really pretty poor. It's nothing like the photo on their website. It consists of a juice machine with a few choices of juice, milk and 4 kinds of cereal, coffee and tea, white bread for toast, white bread bagels, peanut butter, jam and cream cheese for spreads, and a tiny amount of fruit. I think it could be rounded out nutritionally for about the same cost they spend on ingredients now. My biggest complaint is that the common areas are smoking areas. It was difficult at times to enjoy being in the pool area or even to have our windows open because there were so many smokers on site and they are permitted to smoke anywhere except in the actual rooms. It would be nice if there were designated smoking areas, and the main common-entertainment areas were kept smoke-free. We can't imagine ever staying in another San Diego hotel again.

No signage but fortunately I heard outdoor noises and followed till we came out onto a pathway...still no idea where I'm going. We were given a map of the property but at night you can't necessarily see where the paths are going. Our room was right behind the pond and as soon as I looked at the door I wanted to run back and catch the shuttle. No modern lock....it was a lock in the doorhandle with a regular domestic deadbolt above. Opening the door, you see a huge tv (nice) and some shabby indoor/outdoor carpeting. Also, a window AC unit mounted into the wall--which never cooled the room, just blew around stale warm air all night. The bathroom could do with modernizing and the stovetop that's in the room looks like it just woke up in the 70s. Preparing for bed, crawling under the sheets, I just felt like the sheets weren't as clean as they should be. Also, there were only 2 pillows which was a downfall since my boyfriend likes to sleep with 2 pillows under his head. Also, a thing to note is that they offer weekly rates....which, in my experience tells you a lot about the caliber of hotel. All in all, if you just need somewhere to hang your hat for the night, and you've got a car, and want to spend less than 65 bucks it's great.

Yes, the 2 bedroom room is 2 double, not queen beds. They matched the online prices (~$60) no problem. The entryway is very cute, but the main lobby is uninteresting. Don't be discouraged. The rest of the outside interior areas of this hotel are very nicely landscaped. Very attractive and well-maintained. The room had lots of storage for our stuff, and a decent sized kitchenette (we only had a microwave, but some rooms had a couple of burners. No coffee maker in the rooms but the continental breakfast was pretty good and starts at 6:30. The beds we had in our room were not too comfortable, but I confirmed that they are in the process of updating mattresses in the guest rooms (pillow top!). Our pillows were really flimsy - so ask for a couple extra. Heat and air both worked fine. Didn't try the internet, because I had good cell phone/3G coverage within the hotel. There are quite a few people essentially living here, but everyone we ran into was very friendly. We were here over the New-Years holiday and there was a bunch of noise from the room next door from 3-4pm, and I called the lobby, and they took care of it very quickly. The hotel is very conveniently located close to the freeway. - 15 minutes to Sea World or the San Diego Zoo. - 35 minutes to the Wild Animal Park. - 15 minutes to the coast. - 25 minutes to the airport. Although it is close to the I-805 freeway, and we were on the outside closest to the freeway, freeway noise didn't bother us from within our room. The outdoor heated pool, hot-tub, and patio furniture are attended too every morning. The shallow end of the pool has a wide stairs and the pool itself goes from 3 feet to 8 feet deep.

Lounging in the pool doing an elementary backstroke, you'd get the same viewpoint . Notice I've mentioned \"basic accomodations\". Indeed the website and your pool view show part of the story. Jarringly, as you drive up on Clairemont Mesa Blvd, in the middle of commercial plazaa and surrounded by a type of faded suburb so common near California urban centers, you do see a nondescript parking lot, below apartment car ports which does not seem consistent with your expectations. You'll notice security cameras everywhere, old fashioned lock barriers to all entrances, and finally a diminutive lobby. Though our rooms are immacuately maintained, signs of deferred maintenance such as tools/cleaning materials situated round the property, plastic bins to catch room A/C condensate, and even the old fashioned keys with the room # prominently ID'd (only missing the medallion \"place in any mailbox return postage guaranteed\") were a bit, as I say, offputting. So get the idea that this hotel gives basic accomodations, has a rather disorienting entrance and initial impression. The sounds of traffic hurtling down Clairemont Mesa Blvd is filtered over by bubbling fountain pools and room A/C units. Rooms themselves have been made over with our two bed units including newly installed well cleaned rugs, a small kitchenette with microwave, coffee maker and refrigerator, plus a sink doubling as a bathroom washbasin. There is a significant charge for Internet access (we didn't try) plus substantial penalty fees for smoking in the rooms and for taking the rather standard style of hotel towels. i would say that this addresses the cllientele of the hotel rather than being any distinctive management policy. Long term stays are encouraged as this would be a reasonable place to stay while enjoying the San Diego lifestyle, though not on the beach it is but 20 minutes from the San Diego/Del Mar beaches.

There were a lot of parking spots available, I parked in the back, but the entire car park was fenced in, so it was safe to park there. It's pretty far from the beach or the city centre, but with a car, I found it didn't take too long to find a nice place to sightsee or have a nice meal. Room The rooms are simple and clean enough. This is modest standard, but given the price, the room was decent. The bed was comfortable and big. The walls are thin, so if you are a light sleeper, and especially if you need to sleep late, have some earplugs handy. Bathroom The bathroom was small, with a toilet and a tub. It was clean, which is the most important to me. Service I didn't really ask for anything from the staff, so I can't say too much about the service. They cleaned the room when I was out, which is most important to me. The persons I met at the reception desk were friendly and smiling when I checked in and out.

For those who want to know why I say this, here's the details of my experience with this hotel and it's staff: I booked a couple non-smoking rooms for 2 nights at this hotel. I get to my room and it stinks to high heaven of cigarette smoke. I call the desk and a very unfriendly woman answers and tells me there's no guarantees for room preferences when you book on-line. I say ok, are there any non-smoking rooms available? With quite the attitude she tells me there's no other rooms available at all. A moment later the man who checked us in called me back with my internet password - internet access costs an additional $7 per room. I tell him that I reserved a non-smoking room and ask him if there are any non-smoking rooms. He checks quickly and says yea no problem, we can put you in another room. By this time it's almost midnight when I get to the other room and the people in the next room are having a little party. I can hear them very clearly talking and laughing. I lay down in the bed - which was very uncomfortable - and close my eyes to see if I might be able to sleep through it but it only takes a moment to realize I'm not going to get any sleep with that racket so I go back to the front desk to ask them if they have any other non-smoking rooms available. The woman says she'll send security to tell the people in the other room to quiet down. Meanwhile, I go across the street to the Best Western to see if they have any rooms just in case. I get back, go to my room and of course I can still hear the people talking and laughing and by now, they've turned the radio on. I go to the front desk and ask her if security spoke with them and again with the attitude, she tells me they were just talking normally and there was no party going on. I say well if that's the case the walls in the rooms are paper thin and I want to cancel my reservations for the next night - the written policy I received from Hotels.com when I made this reservation said at this hotel, if you cancel less than 24 hours before your reservation you have to pay for one night - so I knew I would have to pay for 1 night for each of the two rooms. This rude woman tells me she can't do anything about canceling my reservation for the next night and says I have to call Hotels.com about it and she walks away from me. I call Hotels.com and they say they have to call the hotel to get the approval to cancel the next night. I tell the Hotels.com rep that they're not going to cancel the reservation because they want the money. Sure enough, the rep gets back to me and tells me that the hotel doesn't want to cancel the reservation. No kidding? What a surprise! I remind the rep of the cancellation policy they sent me, and fortunately the Hotels.com rep canceled my reservation for the 2nd night and said my I'd be getting the refund. I go back to the night window check-in desk at the hotel to give the room key back and to get the refund for the internet access that I pre-paid - 2 rooms for 2 nights, @ $7 per room, a total of $28 - but she would only refund $14 to me for my room not for the other room. I pre-paid my friend's internet access for his room for 2 nights. He was already in his room and I knew he wanted to use it that night, but she wouldn't refund the $7 for the next night even though I told her he wouldn't be staying there for the 2nd night. She said if he checks out the next day, my credit card will be refunded the $7 bucks - I just checked the card I used and as of now, all that's showing up is the $28 in charges and no refunds!! Oh and by the way, she was very happy to tell me that she would not be giving the refund to Hotels.com for my cancelation. I said well if that's how you want to do business with Hotels.com that's your right but at least you're not getting my money. After all this I felt like a mark who got suckered by a con artist. So in an attempt to get one small victory out of the situation, when a young guy walked up to the night window to get a room, I tried to dissuade him from staying there that night by telling him my story. When I got to the part about the people partying in the next room making all the noise he said \"that's what I came here for, to party, so it sounds good to me\". Then he checked in and got a room and I went to the Best Western across the street. So I guess that's this hotel's market - college aged kids who want to party and don't care about getting any sleep, let alone sleeping on a comfortable bed.

It is somewhat of a misnomer to call the rooms suites, they are standard size hotel rooms with a separate kitchen/bath area (no, the bathroom is not in the kitchen, but the sink is) with a divider, The bed was a little too firm and did not compare to upscale hotels, however it was acceptable and comparable to low to mid-range motel chains. The pool is very large and nice. The breakfast room is also large and there is a decent continental breakfast (selection of cereals, fruit, juice, bagels, bread, danish, coffee, tea, milk) and a toaster. Nothing outstanding, but certainly satisfying. The grounds are very nice for a motel and there is good security with the requirement that you use a key to open the gates. Parking was sufficient.

All in all, I consider this to be a good value and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.", "Date": "August 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa", "Title": "\u201cNot worth the trouble\u201d", "Author": "stephanieloner", "ReviewID": "UR7789668", "Content": "This is a true motel!

No, it's not the Hilton. However, it only cost us $70/night. For the price it was a great place to use as a base for visiting Sea World and the San Diego Zoo. I think the name is misleading as our room was not a suite, but it did have a separate kitchen area. Still, the room was clean, appeared to be well kept, and clean. There were several reasonably priced, idependently owned (ie non-franchised) restaurants within walking distance. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Breakfast (cereal, oatmeal, bagels, donuts, toast, and fruit) was included. Our 6 year old loved the garden and fountain, the heated pool, and the hot tub. If you're ultra picky then go somewhere else. If you know a good value when you see it then this may be your place. If I were returning to San Diego I'd book another room here without hesitation.", "Date": "March 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas NV", "Title": "\u201cDon't Get Sucked in\u201d", "Author": "vlc2dlc", "ReviewID": "UR6007887", "Content": "Don't get sucked in by the pictures, this is NOT A HOTEL! The rooms are very small. Motel 6 has bigger rooms. I booked 2 months in advance, ( 1 bed, smoking, suite) but was told when we got there they did not have ANY smoking rooms available. So they gave us a Non-smoking, Non-suite room. When I reminded them I had booked 2 months in advance they replyed \"sorry, nothing we can do about that, rooms are not guaranteed\" I thought that was the point of booking in advance, right?? The room did have a small frig. and a smaller microwave and the TV was a 19\", the bathroom was barely big enough for two people to stand in and the shower head is set at just over 5 ft. My husband is 6 ft. It was my husband and I's 20th anniversary and it started off terrible because of this place. Thank God the rest of our trip was wonderful.

The staff was pleasant and accomodating. We arrived two days early and they extended my reservation without an issue. Room was smaller than I expected, and the air conditioner was not on, and the windows were open. Usually not an issue, but San Diego was having a heat wave and it was in the 90's-and not much cooler in the room :-) We begged them daily to leave the a/c on, as it was stifling in the room when we came in, and it would take hours to cool off, making sleep difficult. Sheets were too small for the bed. As soon as we got into the bed, the fitted sheet snapped off and hit us in the face :-) Pillows were very small. We had no hot water for 2 days, making showering non-existent. We complained and got one night taken off. Breakfast was ridiculous. We got up early the first moring, to find no milk left for coffee, not fruit, 90% of the cereal was gone, few breads and fewer rolls-and it was only 8AM. We decided it wasn't worth waking up early on vacation for orange juice and nothing else. The pool was nice, but only 4 lounge chairs for the entire pool. If you didn't stake out a chair as soon as the pool opened, you were out of luck. No bathroom facillities at the pool-parents were forced to take their children back to the room, or let them go in the pool-which they did :-( Towels were very small, and they don't give you more than 2 in your room. I took some extra from the cart, after asking, and someone came along and basically accused me of stealing the towels. You'd think they were gold. On the plus side, the grounds are beautiful. The gardens were pleasant to wake up to. Location was great, I don't think it took more than 10 minutes to get to anywhere, other than Wild Animal Park, which is far to start with :-) All in all, not great, expected better, never had so many complaints, but I didn't let it screw up my vacation.
