The location is safe and excellent to walk around, to the museums (Cluny, Patheon, Notre Dame, Louvre, Orsay), to the shopping areas (affordable for ordinary people) and the interesting old narrow streets with lot of small galleries, bookshops, small boutiques, restaurants, jazz clubs etc. You can easily take the RER-train, metro or bus, the stations and bus lines are just around the corner.
