A comfy bed, useful desk, coffee maker (with Wolfgang Puck coffee), iron and board rounded out with special treats including a \"Gem stone\" to indicate if you would like fresh linens (and later to keep as a souvenir) and even a vial of sleep/relax inducing lavender oil were all part of the deal. The restroom was spotless and included thick white towels and a host of Gilchrist and Soames products for the beauty in you. The neighborhood is hip and you'll find restaurants and bars galore--an indie movie theater and Whole Foods are right next door. This morning I was cheerfully greeted by Luis as well as the Manager who were also genuinely interested in the comfort of my stay.

In the end we were given another room which was acceptable, but it was free only for one night. And given that fact that two rooms offered were not tolerable, we decided to move to antoher hotel after the first night. We did not want to take any risk. The location is nice and the staff was indeed trying to help. But I did get the feeling that they knew all too well that the room (602) had the problems before offering us the \"upgrade\". It is not a bad hotel, and if you are used to East European standards you will not have a problem. The bathroom was clean and nice. The beds were comfortable.

More like Sham Hotel. They claim to offer \"stunning boutique accommodations,\" which I suppose is quite true in the literal sense. Upon arrival, we were certainly \"stunned\" (i.e., shocked and temporarily unable to react) when we learned that room 701 was not on the 7th floor, but was in fact underground. By using seven as a euphemism for negative one, the Sham Hotel demonstrates just how \"boutique\" it is: in the most literal sense of the word, they \"appeal to a sophisticated and specialized clientele\" that can afford a dark cell at $300/night and happens to be a subterranean creature. This group is so specialized that only two of them exist: Sonic the Hedgehog and Bilbo Baggins. When we opened the door, we expected it to lead directly into a subway station. After realizing that we would be deprived of that convenience, we explored the \"park view,\" which was actually a worm's eye view of a thuggish basketball court where some tweaked out spectators were packing god knows what into their little glass pipes.

Unfortunately, when I tried to turn on the shower, the handle popped right out of the socket and sat listlessly in my palm.

The rooms are quite small, but they use the space very efficiently and the beds are really comfy (like Hilton comfy). The only other issue with the hotel is that it IS right on Houston and there is quite a bit of street noise (horns mostly). For that reason, I may try to find a place in a quieter location, but I imagine beating the Gem's price would be hard to do. Bring earplugs and spend the money you save on food and shopping!

First off, let me say that I travel to New York frequently so I know what to expect when it comes to prices/rooms/etc. I normally stay at the W up near Times Square, but my daughter really wanted to stay in the SoHo area and not a \"chain\" hotel. Since this was my daughter's first time experiencing New York, I thought I'd let her have her way for a night... NEVER again! Let me say, this area is not as hip/fun as this hotel prices it out to be. I paid almost $300 to stay here on a Friday night. Typical NY price so that was not a big deal to me until I saw the room. We were placed in the basement, which we were not told until we got there. The room had one itty bitty window. A window that nobody, not even my very skinny daughter, would be able to get through if a fire broke out in the building. The room itself was also a closet (but most NY rooms are). I immediately went to the desk to complain about the fire hazard, closet room, and price. We waited almost 20 minutes while the desk clerk was on the phone with another VERY unhappy customer. After he was done taking the call, the desk worker said there rooms are first come first serve. I reserved the room WAY in advance so I had a hard time believing that story. What also bothered me is that he offered no solutions whatsoever. The next day we asked for the desk to call us a cab to take us to the Park Central Hotel (way better hotel for the money- we got a room on Sat. night for $200 with a view of Times Square). The desk said he'd call the hotel's driver. This guy was in a car that was unmarked, had no cab meter, and had a huge coke nail. On top of that he drove like a maniac. And I'm not an anti-texter while driving, but when you're going as fast as this guy was driving and texting... it does not make a customer feel safe, but then again neither does the huge coke nail. I know that some people rated this hotel good- they must not have been in the basement (but isn't that a scary risk to take)? Listen to my review when I say it's not worth it. Every time I entered or left this hotel I saw other people complaining at the desk. I would NEVER recommend this hotel/robbery/scam to anyone. Take your money elsewhere.

The \"closet\" space was just a few hangers behind a panel. The worst problem was that both my husband and I ended up with multiple bruises and scrapes on our legs and feet from tripping over the bedframe--because of the smallness of the room and the hard wooden frame all around the bed. We expect the rooms to be small, but not to be consistently writhing in pain over bumping into the bed. The city was noisy at night--which kept my husband up a bit, but I slept really well. Beds were very comfy. The other small annoyance was that, even though we would put the dirty towels on the floor, the supply would not be replenished by housekeeping.

Great lighting- good range from well-lit to subtle. The bad: I stayed in the worst room in the hotel, room 701-- other reviewers also wrote about the basement (rooms labeled in the 700s). Room 701 is a queen-bed with a window that is at low-street-level (you can see feet walking by) placed directly next to the front door facing Houston St. It feels/sounds like the window is not sealed, or maybe it's the a/c unit, because the street noise is unbelievable loud. The curtains were old and inadequate-- you can see into the room from the street! I had to jerry-rig some towels for privacy. Wifi reception in my room was extremely low to none, but was high-speed with the network cable. Cordless phone didn't work- but who uses that anyway? No fridge.

My biggest likes: Friendly and attentive reception staff, impeccably clean rooms every day, comfortable bed (if a bit short for my 6'3\"), ipod dock with radio, modern design without being overly pretentious, big flat-screen tv, and free Wifi!!! Small dislikes: windows are fixed and therefore the only way to get air into the room is to turn the AC on...which i dont favour as it gives me a dry throat every time! The second drawback with this is that the AC is very noisy and rattly. My cousin staying in a separate room to ours had a more modern unit, but same noise issue. Rooms are very small, but i knew this when booking and know that space in Manhattan comes at a premium so got used to it and wasn't too bothered!

The GEM SoHo was a pleasant place to come back to after busy days and nights discovering New York City.

We liked the beds a lot and the rooms interior and surfaces seemed to have been refurbished in recent years. But some basic things seemed to us to be older.

There were plungers standing ready in the staircase, so I am guessing we weren't the only ones having this problem. The hairdryer would only work for a couple of minutes before turning itself off.

Returning at 3pm to check in I was very pleased with my room on the 5th floor (which was quite a good size) close to the junction of Forsyth & East Houston overlooking Sara D Roosevelt Park. I had a few issues in that the bed was bigger than the mattress, so I caught my leg on the corner of the wooden base a couple of times - but quickly learnt my lesson. The bed however, was extremely comfortable and I found that the pillow mist that appeared three days in greatly aided me to get to sleep as the white blinds did little to block out the sunlight when you come in at 4am and are getting to sleep as the sun comes up - the curtains are just for show. The TV didn't pick up a lot of the channels, but you don't come to New York to stay in watching the television - it was just background noise whilst I was getting ready to go out. Other than that, I was very happy - I was only really in the room from 4am to 10am, popping in to get changed in the early evening before going out again - it was comfortable, in a great location and I felt safe, plus I felt my belongings were safe. The staff were extremely helpful - I had some issues with my room card, but was told it was likely because I'd kept them in the same pocket as my mobile phone - moving them solved the issue. I wasn't told what the pebble was for, but I'd read about it on Trip Advisor - so put it on my bed halfway through my 10 night stay and returned to find that my sheets had been changed as requested. I also wasn't made aware of the charges for the safe, they appeared on my credit card statement afterwards, having to contact the hotel to query what they were for - but the rate was very reasonable and I was happy to pay for the service given the peace of mind it gave me. Maybe 'A guide to your stay' card should be added to each room explaining about these. Overall The Gem is a great hotel, the free WiFi was a big plus - it always worked and the speed was excellent, the staff were friendly & helpful and the location made it easy to get to wherever I wanted to go - the subway station is a block down for F & V trains. Perhaps it's a little expensive for what it is, but all hotels in the LES seem to be which I find surprising in comparison to some of the more touristy locations. I'd definitely stay here again though as the nightlife is great - I'd recommend that anyone staying at the Gem also visits the National Underground, it's a great place to be at night and is within easy walking distance to & from the hotel - handy if you've indulged in a few drinks!", "Date": "May 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bend, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly Adequate\u201d", "Author": "Horseymama", "ReviewID": "UR60917381", "Content": "I stayed here over Spring break with my 9 yr. old son.

Don't miss Russ & Daughters just down Houston for an amazing bagel, lox and cream cheese breakfast.

Hotel is located right on the edge of Soho in a lively part of town, directly above the NY institution, Yonah Schimmel's Knishes, and convenient walking distance to the East Village, Little Italy, and Chinatown. The rooms, hallways and lobby are all quite COMPACT but nicely appointed, and as accommodating as they can be given the tight quarters. Staff were very friendly & helpful, including holding our bags for several hours in the small office. We reserved one room with 2 beds but were reassigned to 2 rooms on the same floor (not adjacent) which worked out fine and ended up being a big bargain (we were charged the single room rate, as is appropriate). Room appointments were lovely & I wish I could have enjoyed the room more - we were out at our event for the bulk of the time. Nice shower, toiletries, coffee, fridge/microwave, and very comfy beds, linens, and bathrobes. Poor sleepers should note that Houston Street is ALWAYS noisy. Bring earplugs. Also, for those traveling by car - and good luck traveling by car in lower Manhattan - there is no parking, but many commercial parking garages around. The staff recommended one east of the hotel, but we found parking on Elizabeth St. just north of Houston and it worked out great. I would happily give 5 stars except for a few modest issues: one room's door did NOT want to latch shut, so we had to use the deadbolt simply to close the door; the same room had a sketchy bathroom light switch; and - worst - we were at first assigned to a room that was already occupied. Big no-no, mitigated by the fact it was occupied by other people attending the same event (but not known to us). No one likes to be getting changed & have a stranger walk into their hotel room!!
