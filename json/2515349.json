Pros: Pet friendly (no pet fee, an awesome bonus!), great location just blocks from downtown shopping and Pike Market Cons: The particular room we stayed in #503 has a weird water pipe flowing in the super thin walls (it basically sounded like someone was taking a shower next door but ALL THE TIME). I have to say I was a little worried that there were earplugs at the bedside when we checked in. The room was hot and stuffy especially after a shower (there was no vent fan), we tried to turn off the heat but it was still continually pumping out warm air, then when we tried to open the window, it only allowed a small slit.

Let's go to the cons: Elevator was working intermittently, it happened that we sometimes had to wait for 20 min before we could use it, and once we used the stairs instead (bear in mind that we were on 7th floor). All the other guests had same problems, and complained with staff at the reception, but no one ever bothered neither sympathized about the situation. They were undergoing major repairs on the elevator, and they clearly should not have kept the hotel open meanwhile, especially considering the number of storeys. Going to the rooms: our was small, not so clean, and the bathroom was microscopic, too. We could barely fit our suitcases on the floor. We could hear noise coming both from the corridor, and from the neighboring room, which was pretty annoying especially late at night.

We reserved through Hotels.com and got a great rate ($119.00)...the phrase \"you get what you pay for\" was never so true. I've paid less than that at a Holiday Inn Express and felt like I was in the lap of luxury. First, at check in, the desk clerk spoke so fast about check out times, parking restrictions, etc., I felt like I was at a cattle auction. Our friends also reserved a room in the hotel; when I made the reservation, I requested that we have rooms on the same floor--we ended up on the 7th floor, and our friends on the 4th floor. We went to our room and they to theirs, only to meet about 5 minutes later in the elevator because our keys would not unlock either room. Back to the lobby--keys activated, and back up we went. Our friends were given someone else's room--they walked in and it was evident someone else was staying there (the rest of the night, we were all concerned someone would be given our rooms and we would return to find all of our belongings gone!). Our room was like an oven--the air conditioner wouldn't work and the window wouldn't open. We were in a hurry so we decided to deal with that when we returned from the concert. Our friends finally got an unoccupied room, and we went out for the night. We returned around 1:00 a.m., and our room was still an oven. My husband tried to open the window, and it nearly fell out of the frame. We called the front desk for help--they sent a bellboy who spent all of 20 seconds looking at the air conditioner and window. Ten minutes later, the front desk called and said they'd be happy to move us to another room on the third floor. So, we packed up our belongings and went to the third floor room...or \"closet\" is more like it. Had a lovely view of brick wall. The air conditioner worked only marginally better, but we could open the window (which allowed us to hear every siren in the city [being from Seattle, that was not unexpected] and the dumping of glass into a recycling truck at 5:00 a.m. the next morning). Room was marginally clean (I should have brought a black light!)--wear shoes or at least socks on the carpet! Bathroom was SUPER small. We were aware this this is an old hotel that has probably been made over several times, so the rooms are small. Paint chipping off the walls, dirt smudges on the walls, cracked tile floor in the bathroom, broken window....the list goes on. It was sufficient enough to fall asleep after an eventful night--then get up and leave the next morning. That's the best thing I can say.

I reserved their \"deluxe suite\" which was quite small (I'd hate to see what the standard room looks like, probably a closet). It was only manageable for a single traveler. The bed was comfortable and the TV had a nice array of channels. The bathroom was quite small as well and not built for someone over 5ft6. You cannot close the door without lifting up your knees if you are on the commode. The tub appeared to be stained which wasn't very nice to look at but the shower was nice. I found the heat/ac unit to be rather old and clunky. You cannot do much to control either. There is just a fan option. When I arrived the room was super hot and stuffy. The window only opens 6 inches (to prevent people from jumping since the room is so hot I assume) so it took a while for the room to air out and cool down. The front desk staff seemed rather aloof and disinterested in their customers as well. Do not use the vending machines in the hotel, they charge $2.00 for a can of soda!! Instead, take a walk to the Bartels drugstore just a few blocks south of the hotel and purchase beverages and snacks. On the bright side, the fabulous Seattle Public Library is right next door and there is decent WiFi in the room. This hotel is best for those who do not plan on driving since parking is expensive and minimal. One guest was given the incorrect parking instructions and was told he had to pay $87 for parking since the staff told him the wrong complex so beware if you are parking there, make sure you are given directions to the absolute correct complex. Also, Spring Street is a pretty vertical hill so if you are walking there from a Light Rail terminal, stay on 4th or 5th Ave to avoid having to walk up that crazy hill with your luggage. Other than that, it was an okay stay.

I'd made the reservation for two people a few months before, and when he asked to bring my nephew, I called the 1-800 number to see if cots were available. \"Yes,\" said the operator, \"but let me connect you to the local hotel so you can have it ready for you.\" The local hotel contradicted this: \"We don't have any cots, but we can give you extra blankets.\" Fine. He brought his own cot. We arrived early and checked our bags; check-in was uneventful and the bellhop was friendly and eager to help. I returned to the hotel to get keys several hours later; no problem. The room was small, as I expected, but in several places had paint chips coming off the walls. The hot and cold water on the sink was reversed. The window overlooking the library across the street was dusty and had gunk in the tracks. The frosted glass bathroom door had liquid marks at various heights. I don't want to wonder what the waist-level liquid marks came from. When my brother arrived, he called down for the blankets for the cot. \"We don't have any,\" said the desk. A hotel without blankets? Really? Fine. We pulled the comforter off the bed and let my nephew use it on his cot. I was fine with just a sheet until about 2 AM. The air conditioning works really, really well. The next morning, I was the first one in the shower. The water was up to my shins when I finished -- it wouldn't drain a drop. I messed with the drain plug in the murky water, but couldn't get it to a point where I could hear any water draining out. My brother messed with it, using the drain plug as a plunger, and got it to drain slowly. Ewww for him. We called maintenance, who fixed it while we were out, but seriously, isn't that something that housekeeping would have noticed the last time they cleaned the tub? Unless they don't clean the tub... On the way out that morning, my brother stopped housekeeping and asked them for an extra blanket. They were happy to provide one. If the hotel has no extra blankets, as the front desk said, I wonder who in the hotel had to sleep without one that night. We ate breakfast at the Seattle's Best Coffee downstairs. They were as good as expected. The rest of the stay was uneventful. The front desk was happy to split charges across my brother's and my credit cards, and the bell desk was efficient at checking our bags again. It's really got the feel of a two-star place that might have been a three-star place many years ago. Knowing what I know now, I'd shell out a few extra bucks for somewhere else.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Washington", "Title": "\u201cBest deal in downtown Seattle.\u201d", "Author": "Gisele30", "ReviewID": "UR117346636", "Content": "My friend and I went to Seattle to see the sights for a couple days and after reading lots of reviews I had chosen to stay here. Based on the reviews I had read my biggest concern was the hotel being noisy and being able to hear through the walls. We didn't have a problem with this at all, although we did stay on a Wednesday night so it could be a different story on the weekend. I did hear a couple voices in the hallway in the morning, so I could see how if there were people around being loud you would be able to hear them. Now I will start from the beginning. They have a loading zone right in front of the hotel so that you can check in and unload your stuff before parking, which was very nice. We had a quick and easy check in and the guy even asked which floor we would like to stay on which I thought was nice, we ended up on 4. We used the self park parking which ended up being $23 cause there was tax since it was charged with your room, but that covered us from 4:30 when we checked in till 9pm the next day, amazing! Also some of the reviews made it sound like the parking garage was blocks away, there is an alley separating the hotel and the garage, they're right next to each other. I don't know what people were complaining about. The rooms are a bit on the small side but they look nice and we had all the room we needed. There is A/C in the room that seemed to work just great, we turned it off cause we got too cold. The beds were comfortable, I slept like a baby. Our only complaints were that there aren't fans in the bathrooms which makes it really difficult to clear the steam after a shower, and the bathroom door was rather loud to open and close because the doors are very old. The shower heads are fabulous though.

When I asked about it, they told me that wasn't available yet. I asked why they put it in my confirmation and was met with another \"sorry\". I politely replied that wasn't fair and that they should be offering something else if they cannot provide a perk that was promised. It was not until my 3rd insistence that they finally comped us a continental breakfast in lieu of the missed wine hour. I don't understand why they could not take it off their confirmation email or have enough customer service to say they were sorry and immediately offer the customer another perk instead of making the customer insist. We did like the hotel enough that after our week in Vancouver, we booked it again for our return night before our flight. Again, \"hosted wine hour\" appeared on our confirmation one week later.

The Hotel's location, it's nightly stay price point and it's website photos of the hotel were major factors for our choice of this property. We reserved two rooms online and got superb rates by navigating to the Manager's special section of their website. Our nightly room rate was $110.00 + tax and was a very good find for the location in the downtown of Seattle. The rooms were smartly decorated and took advantage of some of the historical features of the property like the vintage inset tiles in the floors of the bathrooms.

My reservation was confirmed and there was no notification that the status of my reservation had changed at all, but when I attempted to check in the front desk informed me that the hotel was overbooked and there was no longer a room available for me. This is where the adventure started. The girls at the desk, without asking me first, made reservations for me at a different hotel and *informed me* that my only option was to spend the night at this different hotel. When I asked for more information about the new hotel, The 6th Avenue Inn, they proceeded to lie to every question I asked. I asked if it was of a comparable quality to their hotel, they said yes, of course. It's absolutely not - it's a budget hotel with peeling, paint, dirty carpets, and smells like urine. I asked if it was still in a downtown location, they said yes, it was only a few min away from the Executive Pacific. It is not, it's at least a 20 min walk away and in a completely different, run-down part of the city on the fringe of down town. I asked if it was still in a nice area with a nice view and restaurants and shops nearby - they said yes, it's a lovely hotel that's right in the heart of a bustling shopping area. It is not - my room overlooks a parking lot and a highway, and the only things next to this hotel are a police station and a McDonalds. They proceeded to whisk me into a cab, they women from the front desk said \"Don't worry, we'll tell the cab driver where to drop you off\" - the cab then dropped me off at the Pan Pacific hotel, who, when I tried to check in there, informed me they had no idea what I was talking about. The *very nice* staff at the Pan Pacific then called the Hotel Executive to figure out what the hell was going on, and then informed me that the cab took me to the completely wrong hotel.

The Pan Pacific was booked solid, which is too bad, because they were absolutely lovely and I would have just stayed there! Once I arrived at the 6th Ave Inn and discovered it was COMPLETELY NOT what had been described to me by the Pacific staff, nor was it in any way worth the price I was paying per night at the Pacific, I called the Pacific and said that at this point I was exhausted and very upset, and they really needed to do something to rectify the situation - I did not want to spend the night in a room that smelled like urine. (No offense, 6th AVE - I will say that the people at your front desk were also lovely and kind to me - It seems every hotel in Seattle has professional staff EXCEPT for the Hotel Pacific.... Hm.) The woman who answered the phone informed me that there were no supervisors at the hotel in the evenings (Excuse me??? Are you kidding me??). After some back and forth, she agreed to call her manager's cell phone, but he or she did not pick up so now I am stuck at the 6th Ave Inn, it's already 8:30pm (and my body thinks it's 11:30pm EST), and apparently I'm having dinner tonight at McDonalds.

It's literally a block or two away from the station (I took the Link Rail from Sea/Tac to Downtown in 30 minutes for only $2.50). It's a short 5 to 8 minute walk to Pike Place, a MUST SEE if you're going to be in Seattle for any reason. The location is also perfect if you're wanting to go to nice restaurants and close to several interesting bars. It is also a 8 to 10 minute walk to the two malls: Westlake Center and Pacific Place. As I spent most of the time in Seattle wandering around and taking in the sites, I was only in my hotel room late at night and in the early morning. The hotel was fairly nice, it wasn't dirty or gross, but it wasn't like I was expecting anything too luxurious and I wasn't disappointed. The only real complaint I have about the place is that the rooms get a bit too hot and stuffy. The weather outside was nice and cool and the temperature in the room was the opposite. The first night, I turned on the a/c thinking it would cool some while I slept, but I woke up several times because it was hot and had to sleep without a blanket. I was able to open the window a few inches, and even left it open the entire day while I was out, but the room's temperature was still a little uncomfortable. Other than that, the staff was really friendly. I asked someone at the front desk about good bars and restaurants to go to and he provided me with a map and circled all his favorite places.

Don\u2019t go expecting anything fancy but the location is wonderful and the rooms are fine. However there are a few things about this hotel that are not mentioned when you book a room that are important to know. First of all the hotel parking lot is almost 30 dollars a night. Second they do NOT have any sort of AC until May. Thirdly, and in my opinion, most importantly do not stay in room 801. The 8th floor is hot, stuffy, and gets very little ventilation. The 8th floor is very hot and and with no AC it is kind of an uncomfortable stay. Also you have to keep the window open, which happens to overlook the parking lot, which means it is also very noisy. However the one thing that was just ridiculous was the room, 801. We were booked in this stuffy and warm room with no AC, but that was bearable. However, 801 is also adjacent to the elevator motor. If you stay in this room I guarantee you will hear the grind of the motor starting every time someone uses it. Therefore we had the window open, the motor of the elevator, and drunks in the hallway (not the hotels fault), all night. Was my worst hotel night stay ever (and that includes sketchy hostels in Europe). However when I called the front desk at 4 am crying because I couldn\u2019t sleep they moved me promptly. Therefore my biggest advice to people staying here is to request any floor but the 8th and DO NOT stay in room 801 unless you like constant noise.

The staff is kind and quick with checking guests in but when I got up to my room there were a few issues that I wouldnt have expected - the pillow covers and duvet were dingy and looked stained; like they could have used a good bleaching or perhaps the hotel should invest in a new set. One of the lamps in the room did not turn on at all, and the window facing the main street wouldnt open. There was a small window in the bathroom that when opened did not have a screen and was close to a floor of the parking gagarge. It wouldnt have been difficult for someone to climb from the garage to the window and in - being a solo female traveler this is not something I would want to worry about. The mattress was lumpy and worn, with deep indends on the left and right that had been worn in over time with a high stiff ridge in the middle. The hotel could have if not purchsed newer mattress', flipped the ones they have to ensure a more comfortable nights sleep. Parking is in the Olimpic Garage, a short walk around the corner, but you have to take a short flight of stairs up to the elevators that take you to the parking levels - not comvieniet with luggage. The rental car I had for the trip was also broken into in the parking garage which has no cameras and is not well patroled. There was broken window glass in other parking spaces and all the staff of the garage did was sweep it up.

The location was great, right near Pioneer Square and a short free bus ride away from Pikes Place. We also chose the location because it was far enough away from the Seattle Center that we wouldn't be interrupted when we needed to sleep and was on the cheapest end of the hotel spectrum. We arrived at the hotel around 4 p.m. just in time to see the hotel next to us have a fire put out. After searching for our parking lot we eventually found it and a spot. We checked into our hotel quickly and were given a discount voucher for the garage we parked in. The hotel is the perfect size for why we were there; to get in and out and just a place to sleep at the end of the night. The bathrooms were just the size they needed to be, as Americans I think we've come to expect unrealistic sizes for hotels and this is exactly what I had paid for. The room was VERY well kept and extremely up to date, but the elevators were a bit on the scary side. The hotel had a really awesome vintage feel and the staff was very helpful and extremely sweet on such a stressful night in Seattle. Our only complaints were that we were placed in a room by the ice machine which, of course, is going to be loud at any hotel but it also didn't help that the walls were paper thin. I was surprised by how accurate these reviews were about the thin-ness of the walls. The person behind us was a snorer and I couldn't go to bed for at least half an hour because it felt like I was in the room with him. But hey, for $100 I can't really complain. The only other issue I had was that I was charged $20 extra on my final bill than I had previously signed for but they immediately fixed the issue and we were out of the hotel 30 minutes later.

There was a retro bathroom, high quality bathroom products, very chic accents throughout the room and it was well lit! There was a huge desk and comfy chair, flat screen TV, and the king bed was gigantic and extremely comfortable. I would always call the front desk with my questions and they would always ask me.

We stayed with our dog, a large greyhound, and a number of features made the place convenient: good potty spot across the street, a living room type area just above the lobby. We were able to take turns popping into the Seattle's Best coffee shop next to the lobby to get our coffee/breakfast sandwiches and relax in the living area with hotel-provided newspapers, breakfast, and a relaxed doggy on the floor. There wasn't enough room in our hotel room to spread out like this, and without the nice living room area, we would have had to take the dog out to car so that we could go eat. The self-park is very convenient for people want to keep their dog in the car while they go out to eat, etc. Some places only offer valet parking, which can be inconvenient if you are using your car as a dog kennel. It's nice, safe, clean, friendly, and cheap. I like the Monaco Hotel across the street, but at a hundred dollars less a night, the Executive Hotel is a better deal. Oh, one odd thing: the counter/shelf was about 1/4 inch too low... the toilet seat hit it when in the lifted position. Inconvenient for a man to have to hold it up the whole time.

I really didn't enjoy my stay, but I was trying to find a reasonable rate in a prime location, during a peak season. It's true what they say... you get what you pay for. So I will start with the positive... The hotel's location is price. Nestled on the corner of 4th and Spring, this property is conveniently located to almost everything. This is what I wanted, and this is what I got. The price was right for the location and peak season. I don't think I could have found anything cheaper in the area. I paid about $170.00 including self parking. I love old, historical-ish buildings with character. This is for sure an old building and there is character. Too bad things aren't kept up a little better. The bed was very comfortable, but I'm not giving too much credit here because most hotels have comfy beds these days. The connecting restaurant, Jasmin was nice. Although I didn't eat here, I did enjoy the bar. And that's about all I can say positive. Now for the not-so-great. When I arrived it was obvious the parking was terrible. I was pleased to have prepaid for parking. I pulled up in front of the hotel, as I usually do when valet parking is offered, and there were not curb-side spots. I double parked and turned on my flashers, waiting for the attendant. The sign says to ask the attendant for parking instructions, but there was no attendant to be found. I waited for nearly 15 minutes before I called the front desk, only to be put on hold for another 5 minutes before I hung up. I called back and asked if they could send out a parking attendant. I was advised he was parking cars... it should be noted that not a single car was moved during the 20+ minutes I sat out front, double parked. When the parking attendant came out, he got my name and took my car away; that's all that was said, He didn't even offer to help with my bags. I'm not a fan of tipping parking attendants when the price of parking in the city is so high anyway, but he for sure wasn't getting a tip. When I went in to the desk, there was one young man and he was incredible busy. There didn't seem to be anyone else in the lobby, but the phones were crazy. It took another 15 minutes for me to get checked in because he had to keep putting me on hold to answer the phone. And while he was nice, he was in a lose-lose situation. Not to mention, he had a visible arm tattoo. I have tattoos and I love them, but I felt it was inappropriate for a front desk clerk to have one visible. On an up note, I wasn't aware my rate included SELF-park and not valet. If there had been a parking attendant out front when I arrived, maybe I could have realized this. But the attendant just came to my car, asked my name, and drove away. I was used to this and he didn't ask me if I had valet or self park. When I was checking in, it was discovered that I had used valet services but only paid for self park. The tattooed desk clerk was nice enough to upgrade me at no additional charge for the misunderstanding. When I got in to the elevator, the walls were fabric that was worn and looked very dirty. I'm sure it was clean, but it didn't look like it. On my way to my room, there was a painter in the hall painting the baseboards. He didn't make any effort to move aside, and the hallways are pretty narrow. So I went around. When I arrived in my room, the first thing I noticed was how small the bathroom was. I have a thing for bathrooms, and this was small, cute, and charming. And again, while I'm sure it was clean, there were areas I questioned. The grout in between the little tiles on the floor was dingy and appeared to be dirty. I think this is from lack of maintenance. Also, there was a vertical pipe along the wall; at the base of the pipe there appeared to be something that looked like insulation or something, only it was tattered and painted over; it looked really gross. The wood baseboards were sort of torn up (again, lack of maintenance), but they had been painted over. Newsflash... painting over tattered wood doesn't clean up the look of the wood; it only becomes painted tattered wood. Like the fabric in the elevator, the carpet looked dingy and dirty. The room was small, but sufficient for one person, sorta crowded for two. What really upset me were the window shears. One window was above the air conditioner (which was loud) and when I went over to turn the air on, I noticed black spots at the bottom of the shears. I can only assume this was mold, give the look and the location. Also, the headboard was a padded feaux leather-type material that was all worn and scratched up. Not attractive at all. And while I don't frequent the honor bar items, I had forgotten my tooth brush and craved some saltiness in the middle of the night. Things were expensive, as they go with honor bars, but the products still weren't great quality. It seemed like the entire honor bar was stocked from bulk items from Costco. The noise in the hallway and neighboring rooms was loud for a weeknight; I would imagine a weekend night would be worse. And when I checked out, it took the valet another 15 minutes to bring my car around; there were no other people waiting. When he finally got there with my car, I loaded my luggage, again... he didn't offer to help, and he had the nerve to \"linger\" as if he was expecting a tip. Sorry, buddy, but I just paid nearly 30 bucks for parking one night; if you wanna tip, you're gonna have to take care of my bags. This was one night; I had a second night scheduled here a few days later. Let's just say, this hotel left an impression on me... one that caused me to call and cancel my second night and rebook at another in the same area. I paid more at my new place, but it was worth it.

Beautiful weather (surprisingly), and a fabulous location for the work I was doing, but the hotel lurched between quirky and decrepit (and occasionally sullenly incompetent) depending on my mood... The entrance area is split across three levels, which require either a downstairs drag or an upstairs hike with your luggage (the porter can be seen running away into the left luggage room as you approach). The reception is polite but unhelpful as they don't really cater for the sort of needs travellers may have (Power adapter? No. Stamps? Of course not). They issue two room cards despite there being only me, and they had actually booked out four rooms for a total of 16 nights for us (though this may not be their fault). The rooms are definitely small, especially by American standards, but would it really have hurt to provide a suitcase stand to help out with the squeeze? The bathroom was a very tight fit (and I am tall and felt I had to concertina up to sit down), but more or less functional. The 'robe' provided would barely have covered my modesty if I could have got it around my shoulders (more like a souvenir tea towel), and I wonder if this is a favourite trick of hotels to save themselves doing a bit of laundry. Did they not notice they had put a size 0 robe in a big man's room? Had a great view of the Koolhuis Library next door, and was across the hall from the very small 'Cardio Room' that has one running machine, one cross trainer and one stationary bike, as well as the ubiquitous television set that Americans can't seem to operate without. Free WiFi didn't function for most of my stay. Had a couple of drinks in the downstairs bar, but having to call the lift and struggle with its doors (both opening and closing) is a bit ridiculous when you are only on the second floor. The internal decor of Jasmine's bar is for seventies glam nostalgics only, and if you were there then, it is likely that if you left anything tucked under the sofas it is probably still there. American service always amuses me because they promise so much (and so cheerfully) and delivers so little (with serious expressions that suggest the end of the world could not be put off quite long enough to do you the service they said they would). In general, despite an apparently recent multi-milllion pound refit, this place gives the impression of a run down flop house, with a blind interior decorator getting the gig.

There were so many disappointing things about our weekend at the Executuve Hotel Pacific........ 1.We were placed in a room directly opposite the elevators on the 5th floor. The noise from the elevators and other guests returning home until the early hours of the morning was very loud (and i am usually a heavy sleeper, and i could still hear it clearly , on and off, throughout the night). Also the cleaning staff made such a racket in the morning it was difficult to sleep past 7am. 2.We made a specific online request to have a small fridge in the room for medications. This was obviously ignored online, as were our pleas to have something done about it when we checked in. Previously, in other similar hotels, we were offered a small portable fridge/cooler for the exact same purpose. 3. The air conditioning did \"work\" (ie turn on) but produced a worrying, burning smell when it was turned on (as if it had not been used for weeks). So we tried to open the window which was stuck down, so we could only open in a few cm to try and let some cool, fresh air into the now stuffy room. 4. The bathroom was small, but the size itself wasn't the main issue. The shower head had virtually no pressure and the toilet was VERY, VERY noisy every time we flushed (and we could hear the toilets of adjacent rooms quite clearly too). Very old, poor plumbing. 5. When we suggested to the front desk staff that they should move us because of all of the above reasons, they said they were fully booked for our first night but could change our rooms for the second night. We agreed. When we presented to the front desk for our new room the next day, the new staff member stated nothing had been documented in their book about a room change, and again they were booked out so they could not help us. In fact, they freely admitted that they had just used up the last room for the guest who checked in minutes before, and they had overbooked...so they still had to find rooms for 4 guests who had yet to check-in.

I talked to a hotel representative letting her know my disappointment since I had arranged this ahead of time but also my understanding of other guests since the hotel did not plan well and asked it we could be moved, etc. She responded very annoyed and was not open to any resolution besides us going to sleep....it was around 9:50pm on a Saturday night and we had about an hour left of our shower. To make matters worse both rooms that we stayed in were prank called. From 1am-3am the phones would ring and when we would answer it was just hold music. These calls could not have come from guest rooms (we tried calling each other) as the guest room phones did not have a hold button. It got so bad that we had to unplug the phones but needless to say that we did not get any sleep. When I asked at checkout if they had been having any troubles with their phones they said they were working just fine. Granted I have no proof that the hotel made these calls, but it seems very unlikely that both our rooms would have this problem and that hold music would be in the back ground. Also, the next morning at 9:15am a maid banged on our door asking when we were leaving....check out wasn't until 11am. Overall if you want to pay $250 for a place to sleep where there is no customer service what so ever, then this is the hotel for you.

My first impression when we arrived from the airport at 1am was that the decor was dull and dreary, and our mood wasn't helped by the necessity to drag our cases down a small flight of steps to reach the elevator. The overall decor of the hotel and the room reminded me of the build up to the \"Tower of Terror\" ride at Disney -- dark, less than welcoming, with an old fashioned lift. The room on the 8th floor was ok, but there were black marks on the lower part of the walls where items, or feet, had inadvertently connected. Our room was also too close to the lift, and we could hear the lift mechanism. Like some other reviewers, we could hear people in the next room without much difficulty. In hindsight, maybe we should have asked for a better room, but we figured that we weren't going to be in the room much, so we'd persevere. You can't fault the location. It's right next to the city centre and the public market, and the tour buses pick you up from the hotel.

My second room was a little cleaner, but still not up to normal standards for a moderately priced hotel. (And this place isn't moderately priced.) I had to be moved to a third room due to the second room not being a 2-queen room (I had husband and kids arriving).

I had my young daughter with me and we ended up walking a gauntlet of single, homeless or illegal, men sitting on the pier near the marketplace. It was uncomfortable for both of us, especially pulling our luggage along. It wasn't the highest vibration for sure. In addition, we ate a great Thanksgiving buffet dinner across the street at the Sazerac Restaurant located in the Hotel Monaco. Delicious! It was a lovely way to spend the holiday, for certain.

Great shopping, pike market, good restaurants, and the waterfront. Also the area was very safe! We walked around at night with no worries!The hotel is also in the free transit zone, so you can take a bus around downtown for free! We got the queen superior room, and although it wasn't huge it comfortably fit two people and two large suitcases. The rooms were clean and the beds were VERY comfy! The only complaints are that the walls were thin and the elevator was loud. We could hear the people in the room next to us in the morning, but that was manageable. Our room was right across the hall from the elevator, but once we fell asleep you didn't hear it, and the hotel didn't attract a crowd of young partiers who came in really late at night. The staff at check-in (9:00pm) at the front desk, weren't that pleasant, and kind of rude, but the rest of the staff for the remainder of our trip was very cheerful and helpful. A big plus of the hotel is that they held our luggage for the day after we checked out, until we left for the airport, for free! Seattle's Best Coffee in the hotel was great! It made the whole hotel smell wonderful in the morning, and was a great way to get the morning started! The restaurant in the hotel was very good. The sushi was amazing! other great restaurants were steamers which is right on the waterfront, and shuckers which is in the Fairmont Olympic next door. Both of these restaurants had 2-for-1 coupons in the entertainment book, which was an added bonus on top of the amazing food! Although the hotel isn't a stop on any of the airport shuttles, Grayline Shuttle stops at the Fairmont Olympic Hotel, which is not even half a block away! you can pay an extra $5 to get dropped off at the door of the hotel, but you can easily walk from the Fairmont. Also Grayline was alot cheaper than a taxi, and came every 15 minutes which was very convient! All in all the hotel was excellent for the amount that we paid!

Flat screen panel TV of good size. We had to call the maintenence man to fix the toilet, but other than that no complications. The hotel is charming, a cute little coffee hosue down stairs, but very thin walls. You can hear a lot, so try to get a room away from the elevators, and we brough a portable DVD player and some movies for at night to help drown out the noise. PERFECT location. 6 blocks away from the mall where you can catch the monorail for 2 bucks and get to the City center/space needle/EMP museum in NO time at all. Only a short, downhill hike to Pike's and the waterfront. For it's location, price, and comfort, it is a steal. I would recommend this hotel if you are easy going and not expecting a 5 star spa.

We chose this hotel because it was affordable and in a prime location. For travelers who are only going to be using thier hotel room to sleep and shower, this is a great choice. It is not a luxury hotel, but a practical choice for active tavelers. Here's what we thought of the hotel: PROS: -Location, location, location. The hotel is across the street from the stunning Seattle Library, and within walking distance of Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, and the waterfront. -Affordable. Of all the downtown hotels we looked at this was the least expensive. -Friendly staff. The front desk attendants helped us make the most of our stay by recommending restaurants and calling taxis. Also, they offer complimentary maps, and will loan you an umbrella to use for the day. -Newly renovated. The hotel is certainly old, but they have made an effort to update the look with new modern furnishings. The down comforters on the bed were wonderful! -Clean. Although there was a faint smell of old smoke in the hall, our room and bath was neat and clean. I saw no signs of mold or dirt. CONS: -It's Small. The lobby, the rooms, the bathrooms--they're all small. My sister and I were able walk around comfortably, but there's certainly no extra space. I think it would feel cramped if there were more than two guests in a room. -It's a Buget Hotel. Travelers who are used to the luxury of larger resort hotels will be dissapointed. However, as I've said before, if you're only using the hotel room to sleep and shower, it's more than adequate. -It's Old. While they have made an effort to revamp the hotel, there's no hiding the fact that the building itself is old. There was a faint smell of old smoke in the halls and the doors have obviously been painted many times. Carpet, furniture, and bathroom fixtures, however, are new. -Street noise. While street noise will be a problem in any downtown hotel, this hotel doesn't have the thicker windows that many of the newer hotels are installing. The noise wasn't enough to keep us from sleeping. Overall, a great pick if you're looking for a clean, affordable place to crash before hitting the town again.

It wasn't something that could easily be fixed, because there was a ledge built in over it that was obviously not measured correctly. When the window was open, the bathroom door did not stay closed (painted over too many times), so we had to wedge a washcloth in the door. The bedspread was very old and cheap-looking, like something out of a cheap motel. The carpets were in bad shape, too. My pillow was lumpy - and only one per person.

No view, but we didn't pick the hotel for that. A friendly, relaxed atmosphere. Not as formal as other hotels we stayed in on our holiday, but perfect for this hotel. And absolute top marks to the Concierge, Zach. A welcoming and helpful presence at the front of the hotel. Always ready to ask what our plans were as we headed out sightseeing (and to make suggestions of things to see) and to ask how the day had been as we returned, tired and footsore. But he went further than that. We flew from New Zealand to San Francisco, then on to Seattle, and United managed to leave one bag behind in San Fran. We sorted it out at the airport and were assured it would be sent on the next available flight and delivered to the hotel. That was at 2pm. By about 8pm my wife realised that her insulin was in the missing bag. I went down to reception to ask if there was a way of ringing United at the airline's expense. The receptionist was rather vague, but Zach came over to ask what was wrong, then took over. By then United's normal offices were closed and weren't answering their phone at the airport either. But Zach somehow tracked down a United supervisor and stressed the urgency of the matter. He followed this up twice more before his shift ended at 10pm. The bag was finally delivered to our room at 2am, but Zach's efforts went way beyond what we expected. Since returning home we have contacted the hotel manager and expressed our great appreciation of Zach's assistance. Back to the hotel. A handy location - easy walking to downtown, waterfront, Pioneer Square. The return trip, up some of those steep streets can be tiring though. And having a Seattle's Best attached to the hotel is wonderful as well - those hot caramel apple ciders!!! Who needs Starbucks? Seattle's a lovely city and we want to return to spend longer.
