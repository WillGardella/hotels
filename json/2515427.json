I liked the look of the room, its layout being a little different from most hotel rooms. I was there for the \"Magic\" show at the Convention center which is pretty much just across the street although its about a block to the main entrance. It was nice to be able to leave the show and go right to my room rather than to have a cab ride first. The room was clean & quiet as was the area outside. The decor is current and comfortable. The only thing I didn't care for was the coffee maker as it uses little disks to make individual cups of coffee and since I like strong coffee I tend to double up most hotel's coffee but it wouldn't work in this case. Not that big of a deal as there was free coffee to go on the breakfast buffet - not bad coffee at that. One hotel (not Springhill) I stayed at charged extra if you tried to take a coffee to go off the \"free\" breakfast buffet. The Springhill breakfast buffet was pretty good - the first morning of the show was quite hectic and the staff was having a hard time keeping up but if you waited a few moments you could get what you wanted. I also thought it closed rather early - I think it was supposed to be finished at 9:00 am but seemed to be open for a while after. I did have a couple of issues while I was there - the tv stopped working and the toilet developed a tiny leak . The staff said the tv was probably just the power cord as they commonly work loose when the tv is swiveled from the living room to the bed area. Unfortunately the toilet was a bigger job and I opted to change rooms which was cheerfully facilitated by the staff. I did not partake of the pool or other facilities. Of course this hotel has no casino but the LVH is across the street and the Riviera and the rest of the strip is just across a parking lot.

And even if it was, the fire pit area is separate from the pool.

Wifi is free (thank God!) and personnel friendly. Can't ask for much more. The first night I ordered delivery from KungFu. It was awesome! I got the green papaya salad and a bowl of shrimp Tom yum. Great food, 45 minute delivery. A little pricey, but in Vegas just about all decent food is pricey. Here's the funny thing about this trip... For the first time, I took the city bus to a hotel. The 208 picks up from the 0 level at the airport. Simple, simple. 2.00 and it dropped off across the street from the hotel. The driver was nice and friendly. It's not so common that tourists take this bus and he chatted with me most of the way. There is some riff raff on the bus, but not dangerous or anything. There's a gas station next door and you can get drinks and stuff for pretty cheap. I felt pretty vulnerable walking in the area and the lady working in the gas station said that I should not walk alone at night in the area... Which felt pretty obvious in the daytime.

Breakfast is included in room rate - very convenient - but certainly not a lot to write home about. Especially when I was there for a week - packaged baked goods were terrible, dry - old; just give us some bread and let us toast it..

The \"make your own waffles\" are great, but I really can't eat those for 6 days in a row. A mix of cereals and hot oatmeal (overcooked and sitting in the pot for hours, can you say gelatinous?) Coffee, apple and orange juices (certainly from a cheap concentrate). The rooms are very nice. Well appointed, modern - well layed out - beds are very comfortable. nice desk area for working - the internet access should be easy, but service was spotty - they need to bring someone in to work on it. small fridge and microwave - one cup coffee maker but for heavens sake get rid of those 'service packs' that provide 1 pack of horrific powdered cream, 2 sugars and a napkin. Go downstairs and grab some half and half and sugar from the breakfast area and keep it in your fridge. Bar/restaurant only open 5-11, makes sense in this environment. Good service though- good pours on the wines by the glass. Pool and exercise room on top floor - very nice - and a fire pit - which was awesome - very nice touch.

Getting to the strip is easy - either drive get a cab or do as we did and walk over to either the Convention Centre or the Hilton and board the monorail which is modern gives some nice views and will drop you near Caesars Palace and Bellagio in just a few minutes.

There were 3 of us and my friend and I slept on the bed and our other friend slept on the sofa bed. She grabbed the extra bedding and pillow from the closet to use. We checked out super early on Sunday like by 7am to avoid traffic back to LA. My friend who slept on the sofa noticed she had a few bites on her stomach and back which looked like mosquito bites. We didn't think anything of it and we were rushing to drive back home. The next morning my friend calls me and tells me she found more bites and that the ones on the back of her thigh were in a line which is very weird. We have heard stories of bed bug bites and as we goggled more info. the bites my friend had were indeed bed bug bites. She contacted the hotel the next day to see if they had other reports and for them to inspect the room. The assistant gm she spoke with was very rude and didn't believe her. The hotel conducted their own investigation of the bed bugs and told my friend they didn't find any and asked if she went to see a doctor yet. She did see a doctor who verified they were bug bites and not spider or mosquito bites. The hotel denies bed bugs but I honestly know that my friend got them from sleeping on that sofa bed or even from the bedding from the closet. It is sad that the hotel is not being sympathetic and more defensive in a really bad way. I guess the hotel also had their pest control expertise check the room and had sent my friend the actual report. It was negative for pest activity but it didn't show specifically the areas that were thoroughly checked. It is just really weird and crazy at what lengths the hotel would do to avoid any bed bug drama. Their first concern should be the safety of the guests. After reading info on bed bugs they really are no joke and can spread. My friend had to sanitize everything and wash everything. Those things can travel with you in your luggage and one single bed bug can lay 300-500 eggs. I would highly recommend not staying at this hotel.

I stayed for 3 nights. My room was very clean and I loved the set up. The bathroom is separated with the toilet and sink behind one door and the shower and a sink behind another. While I was staying alone, this is really ideal when staying together as a couple in the room because no one has to wait to get ready while the other person showers. I also liked the fact that the hotel isn't attached to a casino and all of the smoke and drunk people wandering around. The breakfast was decent, but definitely need to get down there EARLY or all the good stuff is gone. If walking to the convention center, there is an indoor walkway that crosses over the main road and exits in the visitor center which is on the same side of the road as the hotel. There is a gas station right next to the hotel which was great for small snacks, water, etc. Easy to board the tram that travels along the strip by getting on at the station across the street at the Hilton. My only disappointments with the hotel - ate in the restaurant one night and the attendant obviously wanted to be elsewhere, but the food was good and hot. Also, called ahead to see if I could check in early and was told no, wish someone would have mentioned I could drop off my luggage so I didn't have to haul it around at the convention for several hours the first day. I took the grey (gray?) line bus from the airport. It's really a shuttle bus and was only like $13 round trip - super easy. Easy to walk over to the strip by cutting through the parking lot and entering the Riviera Hotel and Casino. I would recommend this hotel for anyone attending a conference in Vegas or visiting for fun but not wanting the noise and chaos 24/7 of the strip. I was also surprised at being off the strip and still finding the sidewalk littered with pornographic cards promoting different strip clubs.

Upon arrival I was told that my room request could not be met because the carpets were being cleaned on the higher floors. The next morning, a knock on my door at 7:30 by the rug cleaner person asking if he can come into my room to clean the carpets. The room itself is average. The lighting is terrible: for example, over the bed is a fluorescent strip light. Not the best lighitng to read by. The entire room is lit by fluorescent lighting. There is virtually no furniture to store you clothes so you will be living out of your suitcase. Cabs are not availalbe and you will have to walk across the street to the Hilton. The monorail is also at the Hilton which is convenient but in 108 degree heat, the walk can be oppressive. The complimentary breakfast is OK - should really run for another hour. It's interesting that they have a bowl of fresh fruit available at breakfast but after the breakfast is over, they charge you for the fruit. No complimentary coffee, decaf or tea throughout the day. The cafe is small but the food quality is good. Pricing is not that bad considering there aren't any restaurants in the area except for the aging Hilton across the street. The rooms come with a small fridge and microwave oven. Overall, if you are attending a convention, this hotel is a good deal. Otherwise, look around elswhere.

Staff at front desk was personable and helpful and wanted us to check after 2 days to see if a King bed room with a tub would come available but instead moved across the street for the last 3 nights as a tub was important to soak in for arthritis. Here is the not so good news. Breakfast great but no trays to take breakfast up to one's room so forced to sit downstairs other than a cup of coffee in a to go cup. Room - well, here are the problems. There are two tiny lingerie drawers in the entire room - no bedside tables with a drawer. No drawers in the miniature closet. For a one week stay or even 3 nights, you'll have to live out of your suitcase and there isn't much room for that. Microwave could fall off the shelf if you happen to lean on the open door. Fridge and microwave great for warming up one person frozen meals and keeping drinks cold. Air conditioner great but it is inside the room under the luggage shelf and you cannot put things on the shelf or air is blocked. Also they could use some thicker towels for their showers. Rating it as a Marriott 5 is amazing since I have stayed in other Marriott, 4's, 5's, and 6' hotels and this was more like a stackable motel type room and cheaply made and furnished. Everything felt cheap and not like any other Marriott I have ever stayed in the past 20 years. How can any hotel have only two tiny drawers for a double Queen room. There is a difference between simple and uncluttered vs. cheap and flimsy. Won't stay here again due to no place for my clothes.

This is first and foremost a well planned and executed business hotel. It is located just a block from the convention center.

The SpringHill reminds me a little of the the Hyatt Place concept but the SpringHill suites blows Hyatt Place out of the water. Front desk personnel are a significant notch above most you find at most hotels. They are friendly, courteous, professional, informative, and helpful. All personnel I encountered at the hotel displayed these same traits. You can tell these people were not flipping burger before working there. I noticed a guy on the phone who needed to check his bags. The front desk clerk carried out the operation without interrupting the guys conversation or displaying an attitude since the guy was on the phone. Check-in was a breeze. I had a room on the 20th floor with a view of the Wynn Golf course and that side of the strip. The room is not a\"suite\" in the The Hotel sense but was spacious nonetheless. The airconditioner cooled the room very quickly. A refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker is in the room. The work area is well designed and excuted for the business traveller. There are plenty of power outlets, more than adequate lighting and a hassle-free internet connection. The bed is very comfortable, includes a down duvet, and has numerous pillows of various firmness (a nice touch). The unexpected includes true high definition TV picture quality, a 24th floor roof top pool, seating area, fire pit, and gym with fabulous views of the strip. The free breakfast includes items for the business traveller to grab and go (whole fruits, pastries & coffee to go) but it also includes eggs, turkey sausage, Juices, oatmeal with various toppings, various cereals, bagels, English muffins and a Belgium waffle maker. The seating area was overly large for the size of the hotel which allowed guests to spread out their morning paper and not be jammed up to the next person. Security as others have mentioned includes keys required to access the rooftop pool area, gym, parking lot, and elevator access to you floor. The elevator from the parking area opens just before the registration area forcing guests to go past the always manned front desk. This place definitely makes the business traveller fell at home and saves money as well. Food is very expensive in Vegas and the free breakfast is a big plus.

Turns out the SpringHill is even closer to the Convention Center that I thought from the maps. A very short walk across the street and down the sidewalk. Also - easy access to the monorail through the Hilton which is across the street. The gals at the reception were warm and friendly. No wait at all to check in. There is a great little \"market\" instead of the typical vending machines with just about anything I could think of. I ended up buying ice cream, bottled water, sunscreen and Dramamine there. Not cheap, but really nice to have available on the spot. They had a great breakfast buffet that we took advantage of one of our two mornings. Steel cut oatmeal with self serve toppings of almonds, brown sugar or raisins, fresh cut fruit, eggs (which were good), turkey sausage patties, a few different juices, cereal, toast, bagels, waffles, really good muffins.... there was such a nice selection I can't remember it all. Lots of places to sit down to eat too in their really nicely designed lobby area. My only wish would have been for breakfast to run longer than 9:00am. Our room was on the 18th floor overlooking the Crazy Girls Passion Pit sign from a neighboring business... so not the best view, but the room itself was great. I'm not sure why they call them suites, but I still really liked the layout. We had two queen beds and a nice office/work area. Fridge, microwave, free wireless internet, outlets by the bed to charge our phones, iPod ready clock radio. The bathroom layout was really nice too. Two separate spaces with sliding doors so they didn't take any floor space. One had a sink and shower and the other had a sink and toilet. Made it really easy to get ready in the morning. I really liked the finishes too. Nice back-lit mirrors, frosted glass in the sliding doors, nice faucets. Duvet style comforters instead of sheets and scary, scratchy bedspreads. Sofa with a chaise lounge and throw pillows. There were just so many little things that were well designed it really made what could have been a pretty basic room feel really nice and very comfortable. Things like the built in luggage rack over the heater/air conditioner at the window. What a great way to make the space functional. Flat screen TV that we could swing from the lounging/desk area to the bed area. Adjustable shower head...simple feature but makes a big difference in how nice my shower feels to me. It look me a while to figure out how to get the lights over the beds to turn on/off until I discovered the switch at the door had to be on first. It would have been nice to have a little table on both sides of the beds. The 24th floor roof top pool is really nice too. There is a fountain wall on one side and nice music playing up there that really help create a relaxing escape from the noise of the city. The water was warm and we were fortunate the wind was low the day we were able to relax in the pool. The following day it was pretty windy and wouldn't have been as nice. Once you are wet it ends up being warmer in the pool than out due to the breeze. There is also a fire pit on the roof, but I didn't see anyone using it. There isn't a hot tub though. Not sure why. Nice fitness center on the roof too, but we didn't use it... just peeked in. Great security. Needed our room key to access any of the floors with rooms or the pool - up or down in the elevator. Also needed it to get into the building when we returned late one night. It worked every time.. first try everywhere we used it. It really made us feel more secure. I think the 2 - 7th floors are just parking which seems like a great design... making all the rooms up fairly high. There were lunch and dinner dining options (room service at night) as well, but I'm not sure if those were available because of the big trade show (NAB) or if they are always available. I had a really good roasted vegetable wrap for lunch down in the lounge area that I would highly recommend. It was so big I took the last 1/3 up to our room and put it in our fridge and was able to finish it for a snack the next day. Everyone we crossed paths with that worked there was really nice and friendly. Our gal who did housekeeping for our room was super sweet and went back to take care of our room when we met her waiting to get on the elevator. Check out was super simple. They left a printout with all of our charges outside our door in the middle of the night the night before our check out. Best part was check out at 12:00 noon. Nice. Slept in and missed the yummy breakfast... it was just another nice touch that made me feel compelled to write my first hotel review ever. I was just continually happy here and really could have stayed much, much longer. It is that nice and relaxing. One of the fun things about the SpringHill is it is VERY unassuming from the outside... especially compared to everywhere else in Las Vegas. It almost felt like we were entering through some side door or something. Makes it feel all the more special. I feel like we've discovered a hidden gem away from the casinos where we can just relax while we are on a working 'vacation'.... but with super easy access to the monorail so we can easily get around the strip without a car.

It's a must for every hotel to be clean, and certainly not that rare. If you have only stayed in dirty hotels before, then you are rightly impressed with Springhill Suites Las Vegas Convention Center. If not, you must have noticed something else that I have noticed, too. 1. The breakfast ENDS at 9:00 AM, even on the day after Thanksgiving! This is too early for Las Vegas, where many shows end after midnight. Then it's your choice to miss: either some sleep, or the breakfast you have already paid for. On 11/26/2010 at about 8:00 AM, there was a huge line of guests for breakfast. Yes, the lobby where the line stood, was CLEAN!!! 2. The king bed has only one night stand - not good for a couple. 3. The alarm clock is fancy, but the display is pale and hardly readable at night. 4. The toilet room has a glass door in a metal frame right across from the bed. When one person uses the toilet at night, the light shines right onto the bed. The door slams with a loud bang, no matter how careful you are, because the frame has no padding. 5. There is not a single hook, or a bar, or a rail to hang towels or clothes in the shower room. 6. For two people, there was one tiny bottle of shampoo, and a conditioner of the same size. 7. For storage, there are two tiny drawers. Even the cheapest motels normally have a chest of six!

While this property doesn't have the glamor of a Bellagio or Wynn, it also doesn't have the crowds or noise. Check-in is quick, rooms are comfortable and large. The rooftop pool is small and quiet with about 24 lounge chairs. Bring your own food and drink to the pool cause there aren't any wait staff walking around to take orders. You get a different crowd in a non-smoking, non-gaming property. In my opinion, a much better crowd. There is a gas station and convenience store next door to purchase snacks, drinks, beer, etc. Breakfast is the typical free buffet breakfast. Nothing spectacular but it will do. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The fitness center was more than expected. There is a business center with 3 computers next to the check in desk. The Downside: It is next to impossible to get a cab at this hotel. You have to cross the street to the Hilton for a cab. There is a serious lack of restaurnants in this area. You can go across the street to the Hilton or head to the strip. If you decide to head out to the strip (meaning the area of the Wynn down to Mandalay Bay) you can take the monorail or a cab which are both located - you guessed it - across the street at the Hilton. I love to walk but walking to the strip from here is not worth it. It can be done, but there isn't any scenery until you hit the Wynn. If you don't mind a few inconveniences, this property is beautiful, well kept and quiet.", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City, Utah", "Title": "\u201cExcellent off strip property next to convention center\u201d", "Author": "Drizz1129", "ReviewID": "UR63987531", "Content": "Just got back from a 2 night stay at this great new property and can't wait to go back! The new springhill suites rooms are wonderful... fresh, modern, comfortable, and they seem so much larger!! The location is perfect if you are going to the convention center... it's right across the street! If you are looking to be right on the strip, this place probably isnt for you. It is behind the Riviera and kinda far from the action on the strip. But its easy to get in and out if you have a car. The hotel is directly accros from that GIANT hilton sign on Paradise. The free breakfast was great, and they even have a bar and restaurant in the lobby, something I have never seen before at a springhill suites property. The roof top salt water pool is AMAZING. It is quite small so if there are a lot of people there you may be annoyed, but it is a great escape from the normal overcroweded mega pools of most resorts. They have a cozy firepit on the roof as well which is perfect to relax at after a long day walking the strip. We spent every evening there! They have a 24 hour gym too with great equipment and big TVs. Perfect for a quick workout. There was a business center in the lobby as well with really cool touch screen computers! And they were free to use and to print from. Amazing!! Our room was very comfortable and quiet. It also took 20 seconds to walk from the elevator to your room, unlike the mazes found at some strip hotels. The rooms had a fridge and microwave and giant flat screen tvs. My only complaint is the parking garage. And really it was not a big deal. The garage is the first 8 floors of the hotel, so you park, then have to take an elevator down to the lobby, walk through the lobby, then take another set of elevators to your room. Like I said, no big deal, but it was annoying if you were in a hurry or forgot something in your room. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. The staff was friendly, the place is brand new and looks great, and the location was fine for our needs. Check out their website to see the rooms, they all look that good!!!", "Date": "May 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!

The building just recently opened, is well appointed, room are spacious with separate sleeping area and sitting area, separate bathroom/shower and toilet. Room are well furnished, modern and very comfortable (as in all Marriotts, their beds are great) Staff and check in were very uneventfull and very friendly. There is a small heated pool in the roofdeck, as well as a fire pit. Breakfast is included with the room rates and, unlike some reports of other travellers, it was always stocked and replenished - everything from eggs, wafles, fresh fruite, bagels, pastries, juices, yoghurt, etc - an excellent breakfast buffet. Breakfast is served in the very spacious and airy lobby. We had a rental car - there is a parking garage on the lower floors of the building (parking is free). Drive from the hotel to the Strip is a few minutes (parking at hotels on the Strip such as Bellagio, Venetian is free). Walking from Springhill Suites is also an option - we walked several times, but are avid walkers (so this wasn't a problem) - a leisurely walk is about 10 - 15 min to the Strip. The metro train station is across the street by the Hilton - we never used it. Hotel has computers in the lobby to access your email and print boarding passes. Apart from eating breakfast there, we did not sample the food or the bar. It is not an upscale luxury hotel - we knew that - but an incredibly good value, since we did not want to stay right on the strip. Would definitely stay there again and can recommend in best conscience.", "Date": "March 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kissimmee FL", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for convention stay, not so convenient for leisure.\u201d", "Author": "GottaLuvCruising", "ReviewID": "UR57378661", "Content": "We stayed one night at the Springhill Suites Las Vegas (by the convention center) after our vacation on the strip. We were looking for a nice room to relax before our flight home and this fit the bill. The new hotel is lovely. Our king bed room was very comfortable and well designed. The cool blue / greens and Asian-influenced decor came together nicely with a very fresh appearance. The pocket doors to the split bath suited the decor perfectly and were a great space-saving design. We found the parking garage inconvenient as you have to exit the hotel lobby to enter a separate elevator to the garage. It was also annoying to need the room key with every use of the elevator and to enter the parking garage, pool, fitness center and guest laundry. I understand the security aspect, but felt this was a bit much. For its intended purpose (convention center business) the location is perfect and the hotel is awesome. For our restful night, it was fine. But for a Las Vegas tourist, I'd rather be closer to the action. The heated roof top pool was small, but very nice. And I would love to have had time to sit by the fire pit. The free internet access was great (after paying $20 per day for it at Treasure Island all week). Breakfast was pretty good. Scrambled eggs and turkey sausage were the only protein options. There was a nice variety of other items (breads, cereals, waffles, yogurt, apples, juices) and everything was presented well.

The hotel is fairly new, so I thought it would be a good choice. However, I was a bit disappointed. Their on-site \"restaurant\" was more of a lounge, and focused more on drinks than food. I did eat their twice during my stay, and one of those times I did not receive what I ordered. The room was never quite as clean as I like, and the front desk staff didn't seem very knowledgable about the area. Compared to other hotels, it was a bit overpriced. Breakfast options were many, thought they repeated their hot foods every other day. Also, although the hotel is across the street from the tram which takes you to the Strip, it is a 5-minute walk through the Hilton to get to the tram, and then a 5-minute walk through other hotels at the other end to get to the Strip. The alternatives are taxi (I paid various prices depending on the honesty of the drivers), or walking (quite a hike and not recommended).", "Date": "February 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ridgecrest, California", "Title": "\u201cLas Vegas stay\u201d", "Author": "toiyabe", "ReviewID": "UR56720326", "Content": "Hotel had just opened, so the facility and staff was going through growing pains.
