We stayed in a room just besides the laundry and there was no noise.

My husband and I usually try to stay at these hotels and we enjoy the use of the large suites, the access of full kitchens, great full breakfasts and options of also dinnertime meals if we happen to around at that time. It is our 4th time for the Homewood Inns whenever we travel and our first choice. I'm sure my brother and his family were quite impressed and will also use these hotels when travelling in the states as well. We fully enjoyed the vast choice of big belgian waffles, fresh cut grapefruits, scrambled eggs, sausage patties, bacon, yogurt, grits & biscuites, fresh coffee, juices, oatmeal, etc Even though the IHOP Pancake House was just a stones throw, we were very happy to make our own fresh waffles with whip cream & strawberries for ourselves in the mornings. The mornings that were quite busy, people often enjoyed their breakfast just out the doors on the patio by the pool. My niece and I love the sweet fresh Florida Grapefruits every morning too. We found the service was excellent , not only at the front desk but from those that also worked hard to keep the eating areas clean and the kitchen staff were prompt and did an excellent job ! I made sure on our last day - to especially thank those hard workers and that we really appreciated the hard work they put in to ensure hotel patrons were take care of. That is why I always come back to this hotel on our travels. The cleaners and hotel staff always had a smile and cheerful greeting when we acknowledged them in passing. We rented a mini van for our week and the free parking here was great and we always felt safe in the area. The free internet was handy, especially in looking up data or printing off our boarding passes at the end of our stay. Our families were also able to soak in the hot tub and have a swim in the pool at the end of the day when our feet were tired and we needed to relax. We had fun chatting with other travellers at the pool. The hotel is also close to the main strip of International Drive where there were lots of excellent shopping (outlet malls at the end), mini golf places, wet and wild water park, stores, restaurants, etc . We dined at Boston Lobster Feast, Sweet Tomatoes, IHOP, etc. We visited Epcot, Universal Studios, WonderWorks and the Biggest McDonalds in the World which was on the strip. We also had Sunday service at Mary, Queen of the Universe Church. It was a very beautiful church and grounds and peaceful stroll in the Rosary Gardens. The Outlet malls were great shopping and we got some great deals. The weather was great and the crowds are now great since kids are back to school from Easter. Our thanks to Homewood Suites for another great holiday stay and for your hospitality !", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "rockville, md", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for family gatherings\u201d", "Author": "bunnybunch", "ReviewID": "UR128444450", "Content": "Stayed here from April 2-8 with multiple extended family members for nieces wedding/vacation.

Called front desk and they looked into it and told us everything was ok in room above us and would send maintenance in am. Called back after breakfast as was still dripping and told toilet had overflowed upstairs but was fixed. Was a bit upset that we weren't told it was toilet water after we had allowed overselves to be dripped on to use the toilet. But they credited us one nights stay for the inconvenience.

Would defninately recommend it to others with the same activities in mind. Food - we got up early every morning to catch the parks before they got busy and took advantage of the American Breakfast. We also tried to return to the hotel by five on week days to eat the 'welcome home' food. Different food every day, but not much choice. We saved a lot of money by doing this and therefore splashed out on good restaurants during the day and on weekend evenings. The suite was spacious - two rooms, a kitchen and a bathroom. TV in both rooms. The kids especially enjoyed the pool after a hard day's enjoyment in the parks while we took advantage of the complimentary drinks by the pool side during the 'welcome home' buffet. Red and white wine and lager was offered. What a treat! The hotel offer free shuttle survice to Universal parks, Seaworld and Aquatica. (One of the reasons we booked here) They are within short travelling distance on International Drive. Disney Parks are not included in the shuttle service. They are slightly further. We therefore hired a vehicle for seven days and visited all the Disney Parks. I would also recommend this, because it gives you freedom to come and go as you please rather than tie yourself to bus times. We managed to arrive parks by opening times on some days, and stayed late on other nights to see the displays and fireworks by the evenings. Dennys and Ihop restaurants and 7 Eleven mini supermarket are within five minutes walking distance from the hotel. Very convenient. We really enjoyed our stay. What a holiday.

There was enough parking although the hotel seemed pretty full. We did not use the pool so can\u2019t comment on that but we also saw a basketball court which was a first. We chose this hotel to be close to Universal and it certainly was. Easy walking distance even for a 9 year old. The only issue we had was that the shower wasn\u2019t as clean as we would have liked. There was some black around the handle bar and some hair but other than that the rest of the room was very clean. They also did not empty the trash in the kitchen after the first day but we just made sure to keep the cupboard open the next day. It was nice to have the kitchenette to reheat food and store snacks and drinks to take with us to Universal. The front desk person was very nice and he recommended a pizza place which was really good. So much so that we ate there three times during out four day stay. The Pizza place was Flippers and not too far from the hotel. They also deliver. The free internet was nice to have and enough was on the TV for my son to be able to amuse himself the little bit of time we were in the room. The breakfast was what can only be expected from Homewood Suites, a nice spread. They had different choices each morning to include eggs, bacon, sausage, fruits, cereal, waffles, yogurt, coffee, tea, milk, juice and other items. The only real issue was finding a place to sit as it was very busy, a few days we just took it up to our room as it was easier.

I chose Homewood Suites mainly because our trip was somewhat last minute and it was the best rate I could find that could accommodate a family of our size (2 adults, 4 small children, 1 infant). I was a little apprehensive at booking because the last few times we've stayed in the Disney resorts or at the Marriott time share resorts in the area and were just overwhelmed each time with how awesome they were. This year we were on a tighter budget so our options were limited. Also, I know the area well and was a little concerned about the area as I-Drive isn't what it used to be and having a Motel 6 and Super 8 so close by can never be a good sign. But I have to say, I could not have been more pleased with this hotel and I would come back again. It far exceeded my expectations. We had a suite with 2 queen beds and the living room had a sofa bed. The suite was clean, spacious and the bedroom had plenty of space for the pack & play the hotel provided for our infant son. Kitchen area was small but it was great having access to a full kitchen to keep milk cold, prepare bottles, etc. Living room also wasn't huge but honestly, we didn't do anything more than sleep in the room so never actually had to use the living room 'AS' a living room. It was just extra sleeping space. It was nice to be able to spread out a little. Breakfast was always busy and depending on what time you went down there, tables were at a premium. We always got one, but it wasn't easy. They have a few high chairs available for little ones. There was a nice patio near the pool that had a few more tables if the inside got too crazy. The food selection was good. Eggs everyday, a waffle station, fruit, cereal, breads, coffee, juice, and varying selection from day to day of breakfast meats, or biscuits & gravy, or potato pancakes. Each day was different. Staff was overwhelmed from time to time just keeping up with it all and ensuring all stations were stocked, but they were friendly and hard working. An added hand wouldn't hurt them. They offer a light dinner on weeknights, but we did not take advantage of it as we were never back from the parks in time. They post a dinner menu on your refrigerator in the suite. Housekeeping did a good job keeping the suite clean and we didn't have any issues. The staff was very friendly and all the staff members we encountered said hello and were friendly. At check-in it was a breeze (late at night) I was advised of all the hotel had to offer, breakfast times, etc. Never had an issue finding parking during our stay but it was apparent that Homewood and their sister property HGI next door were close to capacity. If you stay on an upper floor the elevator closest to the lobby was a little slow so if your room is in the middle of the hallway, recommend the rear elevator. It was a little faster - and you can get good parking right near the door. Lobby isn't huge but its welcoming and they have a nice little waterfall/water wall that separates the check in area from the breakfast area. There is also a Universal ticket office in the lobby to buy tix to the parks. Laundry rooms had 2 washers and 1 dryer; found that a little odd. I ended up having to dry clothes on separate floors just to get the 2 loads dried with out draining $$'s on the single dryer. Used the Business Center to print our discounted tix to Legoland (buy online and save and don't wait in line). Biz center was small but had 2 computers and 2 printers available. Hotel also has a game room for the kids and nice fitness center. Not huge but has all the necessary equipment. Wi-fi in the room worked well and never had any problems with it. Hotel location is good That was one of my apprehensions prior to coming, but it really is a super quiet area and I felt safe. Back entrances required a key swipe to get in and there was an evening security guard (only saw the night I arrived but apparently they are there all the time). Hotel is walking distance to Wet & Wild and plenty of restaurants nearby. But to be practical, you need to rent a car if you stay here. Universal is close and they offer a shuttle but times seemed inconvenient. Disney is about a 15 minute drive, Universal about 2 mins, Airport about 15 mins. Stay away from I-Drive/Sand Lake intersection. That light has always been a disaster and 20 years later, it still is. Use the roads near Universal to get on/off I-4. WAY easier. There is a 24 hour Walgreens around the corner. Beware, its very understaffed and overwhelmed with late night foreign customers who slow the one line down trying to figure out American currency. It has all you need and is convenient but try to avoid the 11pm - Midnight hour. There is a Super Walmart about 5 mins away as well. The last day we enjoyed the pool and jacuzzi (pretty much had it to ourselves). The water temperature was comfortable, it was clean, and kids had a blast. Plenty of towels and chairs, as well as some 'cabanas' - they are not really cabanas, more like stylish tents, but they do provide shade if that is your thing. There is also a basketball court which is a nice addition if you have older children. Each night there were teens playing, but it never got too loud (occasional sound of ball bouncing heard from the 4th floor but court lights go out by 10pm I think so it isn't a big deal). Our room faced towards I-Drive. Other reviews say these are a little quieter than the ones facing I-4, but I don't know that for sure. We never had a problem with noise. Also the patio I mentioned above has 2 fairly new Weber grills so if BBQing your own meal is your thing, this is a nice amenity. When making your hotel selection, if you are looking for great value, good location, and clean, spacious rooms this place will fit your needs, especially if you are looking to accommodate a larger size family without breaking the bank. For $125/nt where else are you going to get that rate inclusive of free hot breakfast, free parking, free wi-fi, and all the amenities described above (WITHOUT a resort fee)? Hard to find a value like that during peak travel weeks, especially when booking somewhat last minute. This place exceeded our expectations and I recommend you give it a shot. The proximity to Universal is a big win for this hotel. We didn't do Universal this trip due to the younger ages of our children, but being so close to the park is definitely a perk of this hotel.

We chose this hotel for its proximity to Universal Studios, the free breakfast (every day) and manager's reception (Monday - Thursday), and price. We are a family of 5 with three boys ages 9-11 and usually stay at Homewood Suites or Residence Inns. The hotel was fine for its price. It is not the best Homewood Suites but given the traffic and the range of clientele the hotel experiences more wear and tear. The breakfast staff, especially Maria, are very hard working and we appeciated their efforts. I was embarrassed for some of the guests who left garbage and plates on their tables instead of cleaning up after themselves. My only complaints concern maintenance, laundry, business center, and housekeeping in general. It just seemed like someone wasn't monitoring basic amenities or common areas. (1) Our room was missing a light bulb in the bedroom. This doesn't seem like a big deal but my son almost reached his hand in the socket when trying to turn on the light (he thought maybe there was a switch closer to the bulb). The maintenance guy was friendly but this should have been caught/known before. (2) The laundry rooms are unkept. It is clear that they are rarely cleaned given the dirt/dust on the machines and in the rooms themselves. The 5th floor facility had garbage bags, garbage, etc. all over so I used the 3rd floor laundry. That had lint and old clothes on the floor. I commented about their condition to the front desk and they said someone would be there to clean them. In the 2 hours that I did laundry no one came to clean. (3) The phone was pulled off the wall in the business center and one of the printers was out of ink. The light was blinking when I arrived and my guess is that it had been out for a while. We reported it and had to start all over on the computer (boarding passes). No one came to replace the toner while we were there. (4) The room was clean when we arrived but not really cleaned during our stay (the bathroom floor had a shoe print all week). That didn't bother us too much but housekeeping threw out shampoo, conditioner, and soap every day. This meant we had to ensure that we had all these things before getting into the shower. It just seemed like a waste and I've never had a hotel do this every day. The room itself has the bathroom off of the bedroom. While the sink is outside of the toilet/shower, there are no doors or curtains separating the sink area from the bedroom. That was a little tough. The bathroom also does not have a fan. Depending on your family, this means all your clothes changing, etc. is done in a hot, steamy bathroom. In all, you can't beat the price and location. We walked to Universal (10-15 minutes) and also took the shuttle (usually back to the hotel -- its the first stop back). Its a quick drive to restaurants, the mall, etc. If we didn't stay here again it would be because of the room configuration and the lack of attention to areas like the laundry room.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moriah", "Title": "\u201cNice base for Universal or to chill.\u201d", "Author": "family4Moriah", "ReviewID": "UR125152760", "Content": "We liked how this property wasn't right in the middle of everything, but near things we were interested in.

We were here for two nights- February 5th and 6th. We chose this hotel based on the distance to Universal Studios. When we first arrived, we were there much earlier than the check-in time of 3pm. They had a room for us anyway and even gave us a few choices of which floor we wanted to be on. We chose the first floor and stayed in room 106. They were very friendly at the counter and answered a few of my questions including how far Universal Studios was from the hotel. He told me less than a mile so we decided to walk there. :-) Before we left for the park, we brought our bags to our room. I was amazed that this room had a kitchen, living room and huge bedroom. I also liked that it had the sink area in the bathroom separate from the toilet and tub. The room was extremely clean and fresh looking. I felt like I was home. We then headed to the park which was indeed, a short walk and not a bad one considering the temps for February were just around 76 degrees. (nice) Once we returned from the park, we decided to go for a swim. We were also told that we could use the hotel next door (I think it was a Hilton) as they are the same company owners. That hotel also had a nice tiki bar outside so keep that in mind if you go. In addition to the pool at at Homewood Suites, they have a large dining area and were setup to serve a free breakfast and I also hear they have a dinner set up on week nights but we were not around to check this out. I do not know the cost for the dinner. The hotel also has a computer area (2 computers that I saw) and a nice gym. We returned to our room after being out at the City Walk all night (Universal Studios.. I highly recommend Emerils) and retired to a very comfortable bed. There was no outside noise to bother us at all. Perfect. The next day we headed to Disney (Hollywood Studios) which is also not a far drive. It took us about 15-20 minutes. Once we returned and went to our room, I was amazed at how much they clean up. All of my toiletry items were neatly placed on the sink area with my jewelry (cheap stuff) placed in a glass. My ONLY complaint is that they moved some items such as my hair brushes to a drawer. I went crazy ripping my suitcase apart then the room looking for my brush. I finally found it in a drawer along with some other items I had. I don't think they should move items to drawers but that is my personal opinion. Overall, we had a very nice stay and I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is there for the parks. It's a great environment for a family especially on a budget because of the room and the full kitchen.

All the amenities were up to Hilton standards. Only a couple of complaints. There was an odor (not necessarily unpleasant, although noticeable) throughout the hotel. It probably was the typical Florida/salty air smell and generally only in the common areas. It certainly would NOT deter me from staying there again. My bigger complaint was the food. I was not impressed. They served \"sesame chicken\" with rice and some \"egg rolls,\" which I felt was a bit like school-lunch. Maybe I was spoiled at my first stay at a Homewood Suites (Mt. Pleasant, SC), but the food at other locations since haven't met that standard. Unfortunately, I didn't get an opportunity to eat breakfast as I was in a hurry out.

On arrival we were greeted by lovely, friendly staff who welcomed us like old friends as they did for the rest of our stay with them. I really want to commend the hotel on this. Room: Four adults shared a room. The hotel room consisted of a separate sitting room with a kitchen area and table and chairs which was well stocked with a microwave, cutlery, crockery, large fridge, sink area and cooker. The only small negative I would have is that there were only 2 chairs at the dining table instead of 4. For us this wouldn't be a problem but it could be for a family who would plan to eat in the room. The sitting room consisted of a tv, coffee table and plenty of seating. The bedroom consisted of two large beds (king size, I think) and drawers. There was only one locker shared between the two beds, another one wouldn't go astray. The room is a huge room so all guests are not squashed. The bathroom consists of a bath with a shower head in it. The toilet blocked during the week but we informed reception and it was sorted out by the time we returned to the room. Breakfast: The breakfast each morning consisted of hot food like scrambled egg, sausages, porridge, bacon. There was pastries like muffins and danish. Yoghurts, fruit, cereal and juices was also available. There was a waffle machine where you could make waffles yourself, however this was not available everyday which was unfortunate. We only ate at the welcome home dinner one evening and the food was perfect. It was chicken florentine and rice. There are free beer, wine and minerals available at the welcome home reception. Shuttles to Park: There was a free shuttle available from the hotel to the following parks: Wet n Wild, Universal, Seaworld and Aquatica. Wet n Wild is within walking distance of the hotel. Universal is only about 4 minutes away from the hotel. Overall, this hotel was very good with friendly staff. Enjoyed this hotel and would definitely stay here again.

When comparing all of the hotels, motels and villas that I have stayed at, there is one property that stands out from the rest and that place is the Homewood Suites by Hilton Orlando, Nearest-Universal Studios. After selling Orlando and the United States in general for many years, I know how difficult it can be to find the right balance between location, amenities and value for money. The Homewood Suites easily achieves this. The location is hard to beat if you are looking to be close enough to the action of the theme parks and yet far enough away not to be bothered by the hustle and bustle of the \u2018tourist Mecca of the World'. Located on American Way, just off the northern end of International Drive means that pretty much everything you could want is either within walking distance or a short drive away. Within 300 metres you'll find shops, restaurants, mini golf and even a British pub! Wet \u2018N\u2019 Wild Water Park is less than a 5 minute walk and Universal Studios is around a 20 minute walk. Having said that The Homewood Suites do provide a shuttle service to Universal if you want to save your legs for the theme parks! Sea World, Discovery Cove & Aquatica are just a short 10 minute drive and Walt Disney World, a simple 20 minute drive via the I-4 interstate. The atmosphere of the Homewood Suites is as the name suggests, \u2018homely\u2019. The moment you walk through the doors into the clean and cool lobby you will be greeted with smiles from the front desk staff. The whole team here are professional and helpful. Nothing seems too much trouble for them, especially Inna who is quite possibly the most efficient of all. There is always complimentary fresh coffee available in the lobby area as well as a small but well stocked shop where you can purchase food and drink items along with other day to day items like hair brushes, toothpaste and shampoos etc. There is also a fitness room, games room, computer room with internet access (which is free of charge for hotel guests) and even an excursion desk for buying those all important theme park tickets! Once you\u2019re checked in, you\u2019ll notice that the design of the hotel means that your room is easily found and never too far from a vending machine or a laundry room (Ideal for longer stays). They feature smoking as well as non smoking rooms which makes a big difference if you choose to smoke like I do. I usually prefer a non smoking room in hotels as the smell can be off putting; however at the Homewood suites the smell of cigarettes in the smoking rooms is barely noticeable at all. This must be owing to the fact that the maid service is second to none. WIFI is available in all suites and public areas of the hotel free of charge and has a good download and fair upload speed. The suites themselves feature a kitchen with a large fridge/freezer, microwave, toaster, dishwasher, stove, coffee maker and even a table and chairs. Complimentary tea and coffee are re stocked daily. One of the advantages of a suite is the space and privacy offered, especially for families or friends staying together. The lounge area that is open plan and runs off the kitchen is a great place to relax. They feature recently installed large flat screen LCD TV\u2019s (which have the usual US cable stations) and even a DVD player which makes these suites feel even more like home! The DVD players are set to play region 1 DVD\u2019s and not European region 2\u2019s, but DVD titles are available to rent from reception at a low price and can be purchased very cheaply at supermarkets like Wal-Mart. The sofa bed can accommodate 2 and is comfortable for sleeping on, but is also surprisingly comfortable for everyday lounging. There is also an arm chair as well as a desk and office chair, ideal for working (if you have to) or writing those postcards to family and friends back home of course. The separate bedroom features a large window and is where the bathroom is located. The sink unit is located outside of the main bathroom to maximise convenience, which is a bonus if someone is using the shower and you need to brush your teeth. There is ample wardrobe space and yet another flat screen TV in the bedroom which again features most US cable stations. The beds are extremely comfortable and provide a prefect night\u2019s sleep after a long day exploring what Central Florida has to offer. The grounds around the hotel feature a swimming pool and hot tub. The Sun shines directly over the pool and patio area for most of the day and features plenty of wide, very comfortable loungers and chairs. There are also gazebos if you prefer some shade and pool towels are provided. The pool area can get a little crowded during high season (June-August) as well as at weekends, but guests at the Homewood Suites are also permitted to use the swimming pool area at the Hilton Garden Inn, next door. This provides a quieter, more tranquil environment. One of the best things about the Homewood Suites is the complimentary food service. It\u2019s amazing how much money you can save with these little extras and should not be overlooked. Breakfast is served daily with a varied selection of hot and cold options. The waffle making machine is fast and easy to use and the bacon and eggs are pretty good too! From Monday through Thursday evenings, a welcome home reception is also presented. This includes a light meal (served buffet style) along with locally produced beer, wine and soft drinks. Again this \u2018perk\u2019 is compliments of the hotel and features different options on different nights. There will be a monthly meal plan printed and displayed on your refrigerator in your suite when you arrive, advising of the theme on each day. In summary the Homewood Suites by Hilton Orlando \u2013 Nearest Universal Studios has it all. The prices are reasonable, the staff are fantastic, the rooms are clean and the location unbeatable. You may pay slightly more to book a stay here but by the time you have taken the complimentary \u2018perks\u2019 into account, you will spend a lot less overall! Thank you to the team at the Homewood Suites for a great holiday, it\u2019s always a shame to leave, but I know I\u2019ll be back next year!

It was our first time visiting the USA from Ireland. From our arrival to our departure we found all the staff extremely helpful and friendly,from the front desk to the catering and maintainence guys, they could not have been more helpful. There was a problem with one of the TVs and it was fixed very promply with a little note to let us know. The Hotel is a great location for Universal, (5mins by car, 15mins walk, local lynx bus 37 10 mins) it is across the road from Wet N Wild,( best water park in Orlando) this was great for quick visits to cool down in the hot weather. Disney is a little bit further away, ok if you have a rental car, but about 90 mins by Lynx Bus 8 and a 50. Hotel would have been 100 % perfect if they had a shuttle to Disney, however there was free shuttles to Universal, and the other parks. Also all the shopping malls are just a bus ride away, Premium Nth or South take Bus 8, Florida Mall take Bus 42. The buffet breakfast was great, with lots of choice and variety and the complimentry evening food (mon- thurs) was an added pleasant bonus. There are lots of dining choices close to the Hotel for the other nights, ( Dennys is where we mostly went!) Our rooms were great very spacious and comfortable, lots of space to relax, 2 large TVs helped to keep the peace. Our suite had large fridge, kitchen and dining area, and a sofa/ lounge area to chill out. Air Con and ceiling fan was appreciated. The house keeping staff did an excellent job and there was always lots of clean fluffy towels and everything kept spotless. Nice pool outside with a hot tub, great for relaxing after chasing around the theme parks!

We loved this hotel from the moment we walked in the front door. Check-in was quick & easy, and the clerk was friendly and helpful. The lobby had several couches and armchairs, where people could sit & wait for taxis & shuttles. The hotel also had a small convenience store with snacks & essential items, a gym, arcade, and outdoor pool. We were either too busy, or tired to use any of these amenities, so we don't have any positive/negative comments about them. Our suite: When we opened the door to our room, we were thrilled to find a very spacious, modern, clean suite! It had a small kitchenette, spacious living room, large bedroom & bathroom. There were french doors that closed the bedroom off from the rest of the suite, so my husband could stay up and watch TV while I got my beauty sleep. Side note: the week we visited, all of the carpets were being replaced on the 4th & 5th floors. This did not affect our stay whatsoever, and the carpenters were very accommodating if you needed to get by to access your suite or the elevators. Bedroom: Large bedroom with a king size bed and very comfortable mattress. Even the pillows and comforter were of good quality and very clean. This made me feel very comfortable and content when getting into bed at night. (There's nothing worse than questioning the cleanliness of the sheets & bedding!). There was a large flatscreen TV, complete with modern bedroom furniture and a big ceiling fan to keep the air circulating. Bathroom: The bathroom was right next to the bedroom, and had a separate vanity & sink area. This was perfect, as I could do my hair & makeup while my husband showered in the morning. The shower & toilets had good water pressure and there was always hot water whenever either of us showered at night, or in the morning. Kitchenette: We didn't use the kitchen at all, but it was very clean and well stocked with the basics (fridge, stove, dishwasher, microwave, coffee maker, kettle). Living room: The living room was very comfortable with a large sofa, 2 arm chairs, flat screen TV, and a big office desk. The hotel has complimentary high-speed wireless (consistently 3 full bars) which was a nice bonus. Breakfast: We ate breakfast at the hotel every morning, and it was great, especially considering it was free. On Saturday & Sunday it was DIY waffles with eggs and bacon. There was also a good selection of fruit, yogurt, cereal, bread & pasteries if you didn't like the hot breakfast option. Coffee, tea, juice & milk were self serve, and availble in \"to go\" cups if you were in a rush. Theme parks: For those of you visiting the theme parks, there is a kiosk in the hotel. The agent sells park tickets every morning, and is very helpful if you have any questions about the parks. We originally planned on walking to Univeral Studios each morning, but it was very hot and we wanted to save our energy for the park. So, the front desk called us a cab (it may actually be a car service?), which cost approx. $12 one way, including tip. We did the same thing on the way home because our feet were sore from walking around Universal for 8 hours! Overall, this hotel was perfect for us, and I would highly recommend it to anybody planning a trip to Universal Studios Orlando. We plan on returning next year, and will definitely be booking a room at Homewood Suites-Nearest to Universal Studios.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lima, Peru", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful stay!!!\u201d", "Author": "zlbenites", "ReviewID": "UR120249341", "Content": "I loved this hotel.

Of note: - Staff dealt with any problems quickly and were very approachable and friendly. - The selection at breakfast of hot and cold food was very good to stock up to start the day. Mon-Thurs 5-7pm there is also a hot buffet with wine and beer. Made it a little difficult to make these owing to the being in the parks, but when we were around at that time, on the whole chose these over going out to save some money as the food was good. In all, you could say it was some way to being an all inclusive half board. - The rooms looked good on the website and lived up to expectations and were comfortable and a good size. Nice to relax in with any spare time we had which was minimal. Having two TV\u2019s was good and stopped any arguments what to watch with a family of 4. Only problem I had, and this probably would have gone for any hotel, being from the UK and not used to having AC. I\u2019m a light sleeper and do have a sleep problem so the noise from these going on and off all night was a problem for me, but couldn\u2019t think of a way round this. The room had a lounge with a bedroom that was separated by doors. My daughter slept on the pull out sofa in the lounge which was comfortable, but was woken by noise from the hallway from time to time by other residents as the doors slammed shut. Did find a way round this in the end by putting a blanket and two pillows by the bottom of the entrance door which kept out most of the noise. Whether the hotel can do something to the main room door to make things a little quieter at night. We used the pool one evening around 9pm in a cooler period of weather. Water was a bit nippy for us and didn\u2019t stay in long but the spa hot bath next to was very warm, in fact probably too warm and didn\u2019t stay too long in there either and could of done with some of the heat from there in the main pool. Pool looked inviting but didn\u2019t appear to be used as much as it should have been and was wasted, maybe because it was on the cold side which was a shame, and we would have used a few times if warmer. The hotel is a few minutes walk from I-drive and for eating out the nearest place was Denny\u2019s which was convenient, although you just have to try a number of different places around I -drive and the parks. Close by and part of the Congo golf complex was a section to feed small alligators which will interest the smaller ones. Part of a cut up hot dog is dangled by rod and string into their pit and gives you a good look at these, fairly close up. Tips For the Universal parks, the hotel is close by but did still look a good 20 min/half hour walk over I-4. With the amount of walking you need for the parks, paid around $10 with tip for a taxi. It seemed to be a small price to pay in relation to everything else and you could choose to go and leave without worrying about timetables. Used I-Trolley and got the 14 day unlimited passes for $17 each. Used this for Seaworld, Aquatica, Point Orlando, shopping mall at the bottom of I-drive. Found you may have to wait a while up to 15-20 mins at worst, but on other occasions timed it right and got straight on the bus. Suggest is you are new to I-drive, use the service along the whole route to see what\u2019s around and to get your bearings. Also once you have your bearings but just want to get from A to B, use the green route where possible which misses most of I-drive and has a lot less stops. I would definitely consider this hotel again if staying in this part of Orlando.

Too long a walk for little kids but fine for adults or teens. The hotel is the morning shuttle's first stop, so you get a seat before it gets packed. Close to outlet malls and restaurants. Breakfast was pretty good--eggs, meat, a few cereals, juices, waffles, yogurt, etc. They had grapefruit halves each morning but only provided plastic knives to section them--very messy.

The hotel grounds are really well kept, and the pool looked nice, though we didn't use it. The complimentary breakfast was much better than most that we've seen at hotels offering free morning meals, and there's usually eggs, a meat (bacon or sausage), pancakes/waffles/french toast sticks offered as hot items, in addition to the usual continental affair, such as fruit, breads, cereals, coffee, etc. Staff was always very friendly. The hotel seems to be finishing up some major renovations, none of which were obvious because the work seemed to be done during off hours. They were replacing all of the carpets, and all of the sleeper sofas from the looks of things. The room we were in featured two flat panel TV, with your typical kid channels available, like Nick, Cartoon Network, and Disney. We did have an issue with our room on the second day, and we called down to the front desk about it.

So you can't avoid walking through a cloud of smoke in the hallways that has drifted from rooms (such as the cloud that was drifting out of room 505 on 6/19/11). Another issue was the lack of health code controls over the guests serving themselves food the complimentary food in the dining area.

We had difficulty finding the hotel. (We arrived in town at night, which made it hard to read the street signs, and our MapQuest directions were wrong.) I suggest calling the hotel directly for directions since the street sign for American Way is hard to spot. We requested a room on the Universal theme-park-view side of the hotel. Apparently, there are no fireworks this time of the year at Universal, but we could see part of one of the roller coasters (I think it was Dragon Challenge) from our 2nd floor room. If you were on a higher floor, you might be able to see more of Universal. There is a little noise on this side from I-4. Wasn't enough to keep us awake, but if you are an extremely light sleeper you may want to request a room on the other side of the hotel. The room was clean and plenty of towels were always supplied -- no need to ask for extra ones. Since bed bugs are a concern for many right now I should say that we checked for bed bugs before unpacking anything. We saw no trace of any and had no bites the next morning. The size of the suite was excellent for the three of us -- all adults. There is a living room/kitchen area separate from the bedroom. I think the living room had a sleeper sofa, but we did not use this. The kitchen has a full fridge and a two-burner stove but no oven. However, there is a microwave. For those who need two rooms that provide privacy, be aware that you must enter the bedroom to get to the bathroom. The bathroom is a tight fit between the door and toilet, but it was clean and adequate with all plumbing working properly and quietly. If you have balance problems, be aware that the tub is not really flat on the bottom. It curves in in such a way that it makes you feel a bit wobbly. If you have balance problems, you may want to ask the hotel about a handicapped room -- perhaps those have walk-in showers that would eliminate this problem. The rooms and hotel lobby are decorated with bright colors and tropical fish/shells/seahorse decor. Was very pleasant with a nice fountain in the lobby. The breakfast was good, with a few hot items each morning as well as the typical dry cereal, juices, coffee, and yogurt. The dinner at night (which I think is served M-Th, 5-7) was more than enough for our dinner and was at just the right time to make it convenient to eat at the hotel after returning from Universal (which closed at 6 both days we were there). They served a main entree, salad, a vegetable, and a choice of drinks on the two nights we ate there. The hotel is just a short drive to Universal's parking area. Just exit the hotel, turn right on International Drive, turn right at the first light onto Universal Blvd., and follow the signs to Universal.

We chose this hotel after reading the wonderful reviews and needing a suite since we were traveling with our two yr old, seven mo. old, and our preteen nephews. Second, I'll admit that we were looking to do this trip on a budget considering we just came back from Hawaii a few months ago. Third, we wanted something very close to Universal with easy access to Sea World, Aquatica and Wet n Wild. I guess you need to take just a tidbit of info from every review because my husband and I came back from our trip wondering where in the world did all the great reviews come from; even our nephews (11 and 10) were shocked at the lack of quality. I'll start with the small things and build to the big issues: (1) yes, there was breakfast and it was the sorriest breakfast ever. I think they offered bacon two days out of our 9 day stay and everything else was pitiful. I think the instant grits and oatmeal were the best part of breakfast; (2) The pool area was mediocre. (3) Service was standard - nothing extra special, just the usual decency. (4) The room is standard jr. suite sized - and honestly, having the bathroom in the master bedroom doesn't really work for people who are looking for a suite for teens and children. The full size refrigerator was nice and so was having a dishwasher (great for bottles). (5) Men's bathroom on main floor absolutely gross per the hubby and nephews. I also noticed that someone threw away a Popeyes chicken box and other garbage in the hallway can outside our room and it remained there for our entire trip. (6) Security doesn't exist. Every night we received coupons from various pizza restaurants, yet when we called the front desk to inquire, they told us they don't recommend any of the places because they have been known for questionable behavior with credit cards, etc. Also, when we did order pizza, the delivery person came directly to our room with no call from front desk to inquire if we indeed ordered pizza. What??!! (7) I was assaulted or violated in some way by a security guard on duty. I was using the hotel computer and a security guard came in the room to offer my nephew and I some kind of assistance by trying to grab my seven mo. old baby out of my hand and when I told her no, I have him, she leaned across me (very close for any stranger), reached between my legs to grab a piece of paper I dropped on the floor. VERY STRANGE. My nephew even noticed the oddness. I immediately told this guard that I could get the paper and she left the room but not entirely because she listened at the door, as I tried to downplay the situation for my nephews sake by telling him, \"Hey, what's her prob, trying to grab my baby?\" The guard came back in and told me that she tried to grab him because he was so cute. WEIRD. I went to my room and told my husband about the incident and was glad to know that he thought the situation was bizarre too and that I was not overreacting. My nephew told me he thought she was \"hitting on me\"! Yikes! So, you see where my not fully being able to decide if I was assaulted or violated comes from in this situation. (8) There were some shady people hanging in and around hotel. One night it looked like there was a pimp in the game room, and another night, there were teenage young men just hanging around an empty lot by the hotel. Now, we are not prudes... we are from a big city with crime and all kinds of activity, so we recognize when people are up to no good and these teens were waiting for prey. SO, if you are looking for a good location, very mediocre and quesitonable living arrangements for a regular value, this is the place for you.

With Homewood, we got everything - big room, good breakfast, no awkward bell boy service, an arcade that actually had games that weren't broken (most hotels they are some broken), nice pool and although I didn't use it on this trip, a decent looking fitness center (they APPEARED to be functional) and all for what we usually pay for a double bed without a suite.

Smack bang in the middle of everything important with the same distance to everything, with extremely easy access to the highways that take you to the things you want to visit in Orlando. And the price for staying here is unbeatable. You get a full two room-suite with breakfast for about half the price it would have cost at an equal luxury hotel elsewhere in Orlando. The only thing that I can say is that if you are a beginner-tourist in Orlando, This is the absolutely best hotel you can get for this price.

The pool is clean and a good temperature, not too cold to make you shiver but cool enough to be refreshing, plenty of towels, sun loungers and cabanas. The hotel is well positioned for Universal Studios, you can see it out of the windows across the I4, for this reason we had a room overlooking the pool rather than the noisy road, the rooms do seem to be well sound proofed tho.

There are plenty of restaurants close by and only a short drive to the new Prime Outlet for some fantastic shopping.

The pool was a little cold this time of year but the hot tub was very pleasant and there was always an adequate amount of pool towels - again, this attention to service is appreciated. During our stay, workers were having to tear into hallway walls to locate interior pipes to find a water leak. However, this work did not affect our sleep or our stay whatsoever. How these guys got their work done in such a quiet and non-intrusive way was absolutely amazing. The hotel location makes it ideal for Universal. One hotel guest commented that he drove his family to Universal, dropped them off, and then returned to the hotel and walked the 1 mile to the park and saved the parking cost and hassle - not a bad idea if you're up for some exercise to save some $. As far as getting to Disney, I-4 is within easy access from the hotel. If you're getting in late from the parks, the IHOP just down from the hotel is a great place to finish off the night. Although we got there a bit late to take advantage, they currently have a special in which a child eats free for a paid adult. I don't recall the start time but the special ends at 10 pm so you can likely make it if you end your day before fireworks.

One small tip- the rear of the hotel overlooks Universal and the evening light show can be seen from every room, however, there is a road between the hotel and universal and it can get just a little noisy.

Hilton gladly opened a dialogue with me, but stopped after they handed it off to the hotel to resolve. Unfortunately, this hotel did not even try to contact me, even at the request of Hilton, to discuss this issue. I never once asked for ANY restitution. I just wanted to ensure that no one else has to go through what we did. ** Let me begin by saying Homewood Suites is a great brand. I enjoy the cozy atmosphere and generally hassle-free experience that is inherent with the Homewood Suites image. The staff are extremely friendly and outgoing, and work hard to make your stay memorable. Unfortunately, my recent stay at the Homewood Suites Orlando (Universal Studios) was off the mark. My (pregnant) wife and I had a business trip in Gainesville via Orlando. We began our day at 4AM and caught an early flight. Through connections, we arrived in Orlando in the afternoon quite exhausted. We arrived at the Homewood Suites at appx 2:30 and were informed that the room we had booked, a king suite non-smoking, was not available. We were given the option of a double queen suite or a smoking king. Given my wife's pregnancy, and my use of a CPAP machine to sleep (would never be able to get the smoking smell out!), we could not consider a smoking room. We had no choice but to settle for the queen suite (no big deal: just one night). Not having the class of room that we booked available was disappointing, but I quickly learned that it was the least of our problems. We were quickly checked in, and given our key cards. We made our way across the hotel and brought all our luggage to the room on the 4th floor. Much to my chagrin, we discovered that both key cards did not work. I returned to the front desk to have the cards fixed and then returned to the suite. When I got back up to the room and tried the cards again, we discovered they still were not working. A friendly housekeeper swiped her card and let us into the room. When we entered, we were greeted by the stench of stale cigarette smoke. A maintenance worker came to the room to investigate the card problem and I commented on the smell of smoke. He agreed that it was \"pretty bad\" and that there was a definite stench in the non-smoking room. He contacted a supervisor on his phone, who told him to just run an ozone machine in the room. Thankfully, the worker reminded the supervisor that we were right there in the room and that it was unsafe to run the ozone machine. The gentleman offered us the choice of either spraying some 'chemicals' in the room to eliminate the smell or finding us a new room. Again, given my wife's pregnancy, the use of gases and chemicals were absolutely out of the question. We requested another room. We returned to the front desk. Apparently, today was \"inspection day\" and for whatever reason, there were now no rooms available until after 3. We said we would wait until 3 for the new rooms. We drove around for a while and when we came back, a room was ready for us. By this point, the front desk was busy and I had to personally go right behind the counter myself to retrieve my luggage that they were holding for me. We came to the new room and everything seemed fine: key cards worked and it didn't smell like cigarette smoke. There was, however, a tangible odor in the room. It wasn't until my wife went to throw something out in the kitchen that we discovered the source: the garbage was OVERFLOWING with trash from the previous occupants. (see attached photo) By now, the front desk and I were fast friends. I sat down in the desk chair, which was broken in a semi-recline position, and called the front desk. They were obviously tired of hearing from me, and I was tired of calling them. They sent Harold, the housekeeping manager, who profusely apologized and said the garbage was his fault as he had personally prepared our room for us. He further explained that the inspection had completely messed things up, and that they were trying to catch up. He said that this room's previous occupants had basically trashed it and they had been replacing fixtures and fixing things all day. Hearing how filthy the room was before we got there was a little too much information. He promptly changed the garbage for us, along with the broken desk chair in the room, and said to contact him personally if there were any other problems. While I appreciate that Harold took responsibility, to be brutally honest, we would have packed up everything and left for another property upon finding the garbage if we weren't so tired. The front desk called later in the evening to make sure everything was alright, but the damage had been done. In isolation, most of the problems we experienced were not major issues. Combined, they compounded to make our stay extremely unsatisfactory. All I wanted was to check into the room we had booked and to relax and unwind after a long day of travel. Within half an hour of arriving, I shouldn't have been on a first-name basis with the front desk, the maintenance staff and the housekeeping supervisor. Instead, we had the absolute opposite experience.. I hate complaining, but I think it is important to share our experience. We emailed our concerns on July 22nd and despite several emails from Hilton itself (who have asked us to allow the hotel to personally resolve the issue), we have yet to hear from anyone. The date of this review is Sept 1, well over a month past our stay. I would have liked to give this hotel a higher rating for service, but their unwillingness to offer a simple response to an email is terrible. Disappointing, indeed. After this stay, we stayed at the Homewood Suites Gainesville and had an EXCELLENT stay.

In the second unit, the tub faucet would not close all the way and there was a steady stream of water running all night. In the third unit, the bathroom toilet was DIRTY. There was urine residue around the base of the toilet. The shower curtain also smelled musty. For some, the trade-off might be worth it.

I tried another room with the same results so we just settled in and decided to make the best of it for a short stay as we wouldn't be in the room that much.The furnishings were also very drab with a view of the highway. The pool is very small so we used the much nicer one across the street at the Hilton Garden Inn.The buffet food was very unappealing to us so we didn't partake in it and it looked rough . Interestingly across the street at the Hilton Garden Inn the breakfast was made to order and served in a much nicer environment in the restaurant .The final negative was that the morning we went to check out we found dirty towels and somebody elses bathing suit under other towels on our towel rack. Housekeeping left a little to be desired. The positives are that the front desk employees were very nice and the Manager did take off one nights stay for the laundry incident. I used to manage hotels so I understand that sometimes these things happen even at the top flight properties. My question is how is it that the Garden Inn across the street is rated in the 70s on Trip Advisor and this hotel is top 20?It is clear that the other property is a much better hotel. Bottom line is if you are very budget conscious you may get a great rate at this hotel but bottom line is you get what you pay for!!!

The pool and hot tub were good sizes and never got very crowded, despite the hotel being full. The rooms were pleasant and had good kitchen facilities. The staff were pleasant and helpful, and the morning shuttle bus to Universal, Sea World etc was very convenient and swift. The worst thing about the hotel was the lift. Although there were two lifts only one was convenient for 80% of the rooms and was busy and usually frustratingly slow in arriving. Despite being on the 5th floor (the top floor) we chose to walk down the 64 steps rather than wait for the lift after the first couple of days \u2013 and frequently walked up too. This would not be an option for some people. We were put on a smoking floor although we\u2019d asked for non-smoking but the staff were very good and fumigated the room twice for us to ensure it was acceptable. We were dismayed on arrival to find a huge and unexpected building site next door to the hotel. However this gave us no problems (very liitle work was carried out during our stay) and it meant that there was a very open view from our rooms. The internet room in the foyer was very useful. Coffee was available from a machine in the foyer 24/7. The managers evening \u201cwelcome\u201d from 5 \u2013 7 pm Mon \u2013 Thurs was useful when we returned tired and hungry from theme parks.

Taking the shuttle bus to Universal / Islands of Adventure (10 minutes in the bus) and then getting a taxi back ($6) was very successful for us. The shuttle bus to Sea World / Aquatica / Discovery Cove was equally successful (only around 20 mins maximum) but we then took the I-trolley back to the hotel (rather than wait for the shuttle at around 6pm) which took us over an hour \u2013 a long ride when you\u2019re tired!

The hotel is nice for a family vacation, as it has two seperate rooms (the more space the better, when with the family)! I must say that I have stayed at other Homewood Suites, and all of them have had larger suites than this hotel. Tips that I have to offer are as follows: Eat a big free breakfast to hold you over before heading out (I think this is worth about 30 bucks for a family of 4). Treat the family to a nice, healthy lunch during the day, and use the \"managers reception\" food from 5-7 Monday-Thursday as a hold over before bedtime. I travel a lot for my job, and do not like eating out every meal. It was nice to have the option of cooking a healthy meal for my family, and did so a couple of nights. Another tip that I have to offer is that in the same parking lot, Hilton owns another property, a Hilton Garden Inn. The pool and hot tub are much nicer there, and they have bar service and food service at the pool (unlike the Homewood).

We went downstairs to put our valuables in the front desk safes only to be told that there was none available until someone checked out and to ask every day, which we did. Ten days later and still no safe, the receptionist suggested that we could use the Hilton Garden deposit safe next door. It was a bit of hassle each morning crossing the car park before going out but hey ! Swimming pool- Bad luck for us as we couldn't relax by the pool and cool off as the pool was closed for a week for maintainance. We were told that we could use the Hilton Garden's pool anytime. Hilton Garden pool was nice and spacious but crossing that car park all the time from the Homewood Suites to the HG made us feel we had booked the wrong hotel ! Towards the middle of the three weeks, we began to spend most of our time at the Hilton Garden [when we weren't at the parks etc!] We loved the tikki bar and oversized jaccuzzi! Oh yes, back to Homewood Suites! The suite itself was rather nice- large bedroom and seperate living-room-kitchenette. It was clean. The 'free' breakfast was rather basic and 'cooked' breakfast really meant for non-vegetarians-sausage, bacon etc and was not cooked on the premesise but warmed up there as I seen it arriving on a trolley early one morning !. After making a snack one evening,I cut myself quite badly on the door of the dishwasher. And to be fair maintainence repaired it quickly. Because the Hilton Garden also served evening meal, we tended to stay there after getting back from the parks etc. So in effect we have little to say about the Homewood Suites really. The beds were comfortable but the shiny cover kept slipping of the bed during the night. The staff were not as helpful as the homewood Suites I.Drive.

We went there once because I liked their pool a little better and it had a Tiki Bar with mixed drinks, beer and soft drinks. A little pricey, but heck it's vacation. The location of this Homewood Suite was ideal for our trip to Universal. It took maybe 3 minutes by car to get there. We could also see the fireworks from Universal outside our window. The girl at check-in told us. We were right off International Blvd and as other posters a said has everything you could want. It was bumper-to-bumper traffic most times. Kinda reminded me of Pigeon Forge in the busy season.

The bus has three times in the morning for departure and several times for returning. To get tickets for the bus you must walk across the drive to the Hilton. If you don't like the bus there are cabs everywhere when leaving. Just make sure you go to the front cab. We tried to get a cab or two back in the line and they would not take us. The rooms were very nice, clean and spacious. Had one dead TV remote and it was promptly replaced at the front desk. Our room faced the highway on ramp and a couple times we were bothered by loud motorcycles but generally we were very happy with it. They serve a very nice breakfast in the mornings with choices usually eggs, sausage and waffles. I also had bacon and pancakes one day. Cereal, fruit, muffins, breads, juices, coffee, tea, soft drinks, etc. You will not leave hungry. I believe they also have some food during the evening on Monday thru Thursday. There was a calendar on the refrigerator in our room showing what they had each day. I think I saw tacos one day, chili another, soup another. Also a drink with the manager. I stayed during the weekend so I missed out on these. They have a small bar outside at the Hilton just across the drive if you want an adult beverage. There are many restaurant choices on International Drive in short driving or walking distance if you choose. We tried the Black Angus Steakhouse and loved the steaks. Another night we tried a pizza place called Sal's that had the menu stuck under our door. We ordered a pizza a wing special and a second pizza. Said it would be delivered in less than 1 hour. 1 1/2 hours later it finally showed up. Price was much higher. Delivery boy padded the bill big time and the food not too good. I heard later that many pizza places sneak in the hotels and stuff there menu under doors. These are not reputable companies and the hotel staff is always running them off.

However, many of the early reviews commented that they had given it very high scores because of the service and friendliness of the staff. We didn't find anything to support this. They weren't particularly friendly or supportive. I had to carry my own luggage from the car to the room. When leaving, I phoned to ask for a trolley to be brought to the room but was told I would have to come down and get one myself, which I found odd. All in all, we found the staff distant and unhelpful. We arrived after 3pm and there was a queue at reception, but only one staff member on duty. We were initially told our room would not be ready for half an hour (despite us getting there at 3pm which is check in time). After a while waiting in reception, we asked another staff member how much longer it would be and were told that there were plenty of rooms and we could choose whichever one we wanted! Having wasted 20 minutes waiting, this annoyed us. The rooms themselves are ok. They are spacious for the money, they are clean and they had good facilities. However, as with all hotels, the walls were thin and we could hear our neighbours TV clearly and whenever they went to the toilet(!) and flushed! The pool area was small - you'd be better off just walking the short distance to Wet 'n Wild. The breakfast was ok, not great but then it is free so I can't complain too much. The location is good also. We were only there for one night so it wasn't too bad, but I can't help but feel that we would not have enjoyed it had we been there for a week or two.

I think not!\u201d", "Author": "Busy-retired", "ReviewID": "UR7260247", "Content": "Homewood Suites are our all time favorite chain so we are familiar with the general structure and amenities of this hotel chain. I did not realize I had booked us at TA's Number One pick in Orlando until after I made my reservation. Perhaps that high rating created some unrealistic expectations in my mind. I certainly expected an experience at least as good as what I normally have in a Homewood Suites. Unfortunately I did not have it. To begin our experience I was not able to book directly with the hotel property unless I wanted to pay an additional $50/night. I had to reserve on-line with the Hilton website to obtain a rate of $170, which is still expensive for our budget. Registration was painless if performed by an employee who was clearly indifferent to her assigned task. I had specifically requested a room on the inside of the building so that we did not hear traffic noise from I-4 outside our window. I even called earlier in the day to confirm that room assignment, and was assured there would be no problem. We were placed on the I-4 side of the building. We were also informed that the swimming pool was closed due to some non-specified issue, but were invited to use the pool across the parking lot at the Hilton Garden Inn. Given that both properties were filled with parents with smaller children, the absence of one swimming pool put a huge strain on the one remaining, if one could ignore the inconvenience of traipsing across the parking lot. When we entered our room several things became instantly obvious. The first was that the room was certainly the smallest we have ever seen in a Homewood Suites. One glance told us that we would have to engage in significant furniture moving in order to use the hide-a-bed. In fact, once the bed was extended it was impossible to reach anything between the bed and the window, and pretty much impossible to use the desk or the arm chair. The second obvious issue was the condition of the room. The furniture was flithy, and clearly in need of replacement. Not only were there huge streaks of grease and dirt on the furniture, but it was not comfortable. Something had happened to the bed mechanism in the couch and it was not, or could not be closed completely. In addition, the bed in the couch was totally worn-out and truly uncomfortable. One also wonders why the bed in the couch cannot be made up with sheets and blanket like the other beds in the room. Clearly someone is going to use it as a bed at some point, and It is obnoxious and, in the case of this room, difficult to make-up a bed particularly when one is tired and desires to retire for the evening. The third issue was the decor. Who knows what had happened it the room. The walls were fairly tasteful in jewels tones, but the curtains inthe living room were truly strange. The hard valanece over the windows was a floral print, which matched the fabrics in the bedroom. Unlike the bedroom draperies; however, the living room drapes were bright stripes, which clashed horribly with the flowered valance. My husband hated to touch them because he claimed they felt like rubber. Underneath the draperies there were, for some unfathonable reason, polka-dot sheers. Perhaps the room was being transitioned into a circus theme. Who knows? Whatever the concept was, it did not work for us. We can clearly acknowledge that the decor of the room did not reflect a $150/night room, nor did it reflect what standards I thought would exist for TA's Number One hotel. I would also note that all of the pillows are horrid. I believe they are cheap K-Mart pillows that have seriously out lived there life expectancy. If possible, it would be best to bring our own. In terms of room amenities, there were almost no choices on TV unless you wanted to do pay-for-view movies. The wireless internet, however, did work effectively. Overall we would give the room and its furnishings a C- Breakfast on the first morning was standard fare. We headed for the waffle irons because it is always possible to get a fresh waffle when you make it yourself. Everything else on the buffet had been prepared well in advance. The bacon was so thin and burned black that it virtually dissoved into the puddle of grease in the chafining dish.....same story with the sausage. There were about two tablespoons of scrambled eggs remaining on the buffet and the dish was not replenished during our breakfast. Nonetheless, the waffle irons worked well, and there was the additional perk of hot maple syrup or bluberry or strawberry topping. Overall, out first breakfast was a good thing......probably a B+. The second day was another story all together. There were no wafles. In place of the waffle station was a dish with about eight \"somethings\" that might have been, in some previous incarnation, bisquits. Next to these things was a bowl of glutinous substance that one of the food service workers identified at gravy We opted to leave and find actual food somewhere else. That breakfast would get an F. We did not participate in the little supper and free wine/beer hosted in the evening as we were doing our own entertainment activities. I have never understood why this particularly amenity is not offered on Friday, Saturday or Sunday but the room rates for those three days are just as high, if not higher than the rates during the week. I also found it strange that guests were pressured into giving the Hilton sponsored surverys \"all 10s\". We were advised upon check-in that we would receive a survey in the mail, and were requested to give \"all 10s\". In addition, we were called on the last night of our stay and reminded again about giving \"all 10s\". If the verbal warnings were not sufficient, there was a notice on the refrigerator stressing, once more, to give \"all 10s\" when we received the Hilton survey. I can confirm that it is truly a popular property. At breakfast there were dozens and dozens of families with young children. Every time I passed the business center it was filled with pre-teens playing games or using the internet on the computer provided, for what one assumes is, business use. The children also seemed to enjoy playing on the elevator next door to our room. One understands that when in Orlando coping with children is inevitable, and one does not expect the hotel to act as babysitters for exhausted parents who have given up on the job. Still, a visitor to this property should be aware that it is highly family oriented and be prepared for behaviors that come with family-oriented properties. In other words, do not plan on using the hotel business center, swimming pool or common areas. Be prepared for the patter of little feet overhead, and squeals of frustration among sibilings. Know that looking in the direction of a parent will be pointless. By the time they arrive at the hotel their eyes are already glazed over in some type of trance that clearly prevents what would other wise be direct child abuse. You are free, however, to mutter quietly to yourself that your children would have never been allowed such liberities in a nice and very expensive hotel. If I had paid $75/night for this experience I would still have been bothered by the decor, and the wornout furniture, but would chalk it up to on-going rennovations and a comparable room rate. At $170/night I expect my room to look unblemished and appropriately decorated with matching fabrics. I expect food that falls into the eatable category. I expect an on-property swimming pool. I expect some TV choices, including several premium channels.

When we arrived, there was a sign right inside the lobby that said \"Please welcome the Guest of the Day\" which had my name under it and I wasn't quite sure what that meant. While checking in, I didn't say anything about it but just as I was given the rooms keys, he also handed me a bag with lots of little goodies, like snacks and lotions, etc, and explained that I was selected as the Guest of the day and was receiving a welcome bag. That was definitely a nice little surprise. The hotel itself is spotless, the staff is very friendly and attentive, and the suites are great sizes and comfortable. The ONLY negative thing I would say is that we had a problem with the extra blanket and sheets they store in the closet for the pull-out sofa. It was late the first night before we pulled it out and noticed the blanket was clearly not cleaned. It wasn't a huge deal so we rolled it up in a ball and assumed they'd replace it was a clean one in the morning. After coming back after they cleaned the next day, the room was cleaned but unfortunately the blanket and sheets were still rolled up in the ball next to the sofa. We considered that pretty minor compared to the overall cleanliness and convenience of the hotel. Also, just to note, I'd consider the hotel on the very limits of \"walking\" distance to Universal.", "Date": "March 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat place, loved the stay!\u201d", "Author": "Mike463502", "ReviewID": "UR7218351", "Content": "My family and I recently stayed at Homewood Suites and were very pleased with our visit.

The only issue we had is that there were ants in the bathroom of our room. But that was not too bothersome. The breakfast was pretty good. It wasn't the best I've had, but I've had much worse in other places. Either way it was still worth it. Plus I recieved a very good deal on the room because they offer a military discount. The hotel is also in a very good location. Less than a two minute walk from busy International Drive and within arms reach of any kind of restuarant to can imagine.

You actually don't need the kitchen....They give you a complete Full hot breakfast buffet every morning...Bacon.sausage,eggs,potatoes,fruit,yogart,waffles and much more. It may vary a bit each day. BIG PLUS...they even have a light meal in the evenings Mon.-Thurs. including wine and beer. One night they had shepards pie,pineapple and ceaser salad. The next night they had cheese burgers,fruit and regular salad. Not bad for an evening meal. It's all included in the price of your room. Meals change nightly. They even put a meanu in your room. Last year we paid $154 a night and this year it was $124. You can't beat it. Clean, well located place. We wouldn't stay anywhere else when at Unniversal and you can always drive to Disney from there too. Next door a couple paid more than we did,not a suite and no food. Stay here instead.

The person we spoke to was clear and helpful and the reservations were made smoothly. We had a CAA discount rate of $125US/night. We were going to check in very early (9am) and they were so flexible that we were able to get into our room PLUS help ourselves to the breakfast buffet before we caught the free shuttle to Universal Studios. (as well as do some laundry!) Shuttles were very not that frequent, so we took the later morning one. Check-In was a breeze- took 5 minutes, maybe less. We had a first floor room and it was lovely and large. Terrific kitchen with full size fridge and whatever supplies you could think of although we didn't get a chance to use any of it. As well- they left bottles of water and cookies as a snack on the kitchen table- a nice touch. There was a large living room area with a couch+tv+desk. We didn't take advantage of their free wireless internet. A separate (spacious) room contained the 2 queen beds. They were very comfortable. The adjacent area contained a closet + vanity/sink area. Lots of storage space and brightly lit. Toilet+bath/shower was very clean with fluffy white towels and good water pressure. We didn't have a chance to use their outdoor pool as the weather was too cool. They also had a outdoor basketball court and an indoor fitness room that we didn't have a chance to use. I have to mentioned that the free food aspect of our stay was a very pleasant surprise- even though I had read about this hotel in previous reviews. It far exceeded my expectations. The breakfast buffet was quite bountiful- above average for sure as it contained several beverage options, fruits, yogurt, pastries, eggs, sausage, bagels/toast and waffles. It also ran till 10am? which is nice- when you're on vacation it's nice to be able to sleep in and still get breakfast. PLUS they offer a light supper Mon-Thurs I think. After coming back from the theme park- we were still able to catch the tail end of the meal-- this is really nice since we were tired and didn't really want to venture outside the hotel again for food (although there were many options nearby-maybe not walking distance but definitely by car). The light meal was substantial enough that we were quite satisfied. (meatball subs+salad+fruit) We also used their business facilities- they only had 2 public terminals so we had to make the rounds several times in order to get some time on them. I also want to mention the VERY pleasant staff in the entire establishment. Everybody greeted you pleasantly, and the staff managing the food were very accomodating when asked for additional buns etcetc. The hotel was about a $40 (incl. tip) cab ride away to the airport. (it was 6am when we had the cab ride) And roughly a 15 minute shuttle ride to Universal studios. (the shuttle stops at several other hotels, so the time would probably vary according to how many people were going) As well, you have to go across to the hotel across the parking lot to get 'tickets' because they have a special counter detailing which shuttles go where. In summary- this was a terrific hotel - For extended stays of large groups- this hotel would be an excellent deal. Like a home away from home. Highly recommended. One little tip-- we had a semi-incompetent cabdriver drive us to the hotel-- even though we said we wanted to go to the Homewood Suites closest to Universal Studios on AMERICAN WAY- he still drove us to the wrong location. Make sure you emphasize which location you are going to!

This was honored no problem. A credit card is necessary to stay there. A hold will be put on your card even if you pay cash (something I didn't realize until it was time to go on the cruiseship).

Frankly, we chose it because it was #1 in popularity in Orlando and we wanted to see why. We were almost entirely pleased with our experience, with only minor detractions. It is a little hard to find if you don\u2019t know the neighborhood, being on a loop side street and not too easy to locate from the thoroughfare. Check-in was very pleasant. The front-desk staff is well trained, polite, friendly, and professional. We had requested a suite on the side away from the major highway and got what we asked for. A small convenience shop next to the front desk offers most amenities travelers might need. The all-suite hotel was apparently nearly full, with businesspeople and internationals very obvious. Families were well represented also. Hallways are nicely finished and well lit. The layout is simple and easy to find your way around. There is a game room for kids, a well-equipped exercise room, and a business office with two computers for guest use. Most rooms get wireless, high-speed Internet reception, but not all. We talked to guests who couldn\u2019t connect in their room. Connectivity in our suite was not entirely reliable. But Internet is free, so we can\u2019t complain. We were very pleasantly surprised when we opened the door to our suite. The table was very attractively set for two! One enters next to a very well-equipped kitchenette where one could easily prepare full meals. Just beyond is the living area with a two-cushion sofabed and chair, table, and entertainment center. The TV had a keyboard and game control device. Through a closeable door one moves into the good-sized bedroom and bath area. We were assigned two queen beds. Good drapes almost completely blocked outside light, useful due to the bright area lighting at night. There was a combo chest of drawers under another TV. A very attractive, well-lit lavatory area was across from the water closet containing the toilet and tub. We had an abundance of towels for a change and didn\u2019t need to request more. Of course there were the customary iron, ironing board, hair dryer, and personal hygiene amenities. Interestingly, hot water in the sink and shower was instantaneous. The shower head was ok, but not great. Everything worked (except spotty Internet) and was clean, although the living room furniture was worn and needed replacing. Pool and Jacuzzi: Clean, well-equipped, and neat. Plenty of towels and chaise lounges. Breakfast: Served in a large eating area off the lobby, breakfast was more than the usual cello-wrapped muffins and drinks. There was a juice bar, milk, and several other beverage choices. Waffle iron, chafing dishes containing scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, and hash browns. (Why can\u2019t hotels serve good coffee? It always tastes like it was made by someone who is mad at coffee drinkers! Ptui!) But everyone seemed to find plenty to eat and chomped happily. Evening stuff: From 5 to 7 p.m. there were complimentary beverages and finger food. But people were carrying away plates of Wonder Bread and cold cuts, obviously making a cheap dinner for themselves. All-in-all, a good value especially considering the proximity to everything hedonistic in Orlando. Surrounded by restaurants of every sort and close to a Walgreens store.

I chose this hotel after reading the rave reviews on this website. We were so glad that we did and the reviewer from the 3rd August must have stayed at the wrong hotel. All the staff were friendly and helpful. I read the reviews about pool side rooms being better than rooms facing the highway and asked to be changed upon our arrival as we had been allocated a highway view. Mark, the receptionist did this instantly. The rooms are spacious with a room set apart from the bedroom. This is execellent for those with children who have gone to bed and can watch tv and relax without disturbing the children sleeping. This is what persuaded to stay here rather than other hotels who have the bedrooms and bathrooms and that's it. Our room was cleaned every day without fail and we had no complaints. The free breakfast, again an added bonus over other hotels, was very good and we had the managers special, the free evening buffet on one occasion, which was spaghetti. The catering staff were also very helpful. It is the little extras that make the stay pleasant. There are free pool towels to use. 2 computers with internet access, again free. One dollar to use the washing machine and one dollar to use the dryer. Free car parking. Compare that to other hotels. The hotel is graded three and half stars and it is easily worthy of that. I would easily recommend this to anyone. Our only gripe, as highlighted by another reviewer was when we stayed at the hotel there were 80 Venezualan students aged 15 staying. At times it felt like you were staying at a youth hostel as they made a lot of noise..The hotel is ideally situated off International Drive.

We were extremely disappointed, and had to look at four different rooms before finally finding one we could halfway bare to stay in for the duration of our stay. Here's why: - The rooms facing the freeway were very noisy (and that's at least half the rooms, remember that the freeway is right outside the window). - All the rooms were dirty. The bathrooms were not properly cleaned, one room had sheets with brown stains on them, the carpets were not vacuumed around the edges (meaning the foot closest to the wall, and keep in mind, these are wall-to-wall carpets). In addition, housekeeping sprayed the rooms with a deodorizer so grosse that we had to air out the rooms for hours before being able to spend any time there. - The rooms with two queen beds in them (which includes most rooms) only have one nightstand and one night lamp, which both beds have to share. Very inconvenient. - The dinner food was unhealthy (they serve dinner Monday through Thursday). Saturated fat and refined carbs, and that was it. - The area is not safe. - And the absolutely worst part: The service was the worst we have ever experienced. We are very well travelled, and we were shocked!! When we, in a very polite manner, complained, the staff didn't listen, cut us off by answering all incoming phone calls, were rude, unhelpful and arrogant. I considered calling their head office to tell them about this, as it was so horrible. When asking them for advice on restaurants in the area, they gave us wrong directions. So they were unknowledgeable as well. What's good about this place: - The rooms are large, and they have a kitchenette including a refridgerator. There's a separate sitting area. - The parking was free and ample. - The rate included breakfast. - The hotel is close to International Drive, Wet n' Wild and Universal Studios (walking distance).

We had a clean room when we arrived (minus the silverware that was set out on the table - but we didn't care because we weren't going to use it, anyway - and, there was a dishwasher if we had wanted to use it - so, no big deal). We had a large refrigerator which came in very handy for our food and drinks. The staff was very accomodating and friendly at all times!!! It was also nice that (at night) we always had a security guard walking around in the lobby and the pool area - that made us feel very safe. We had complimentary breakfasts that were very yummy and were what really made the hotel worth it's price! We were able to make our own fresh, hot waffles (other things were also offered - fruit, scrambled eggs, yogurt, rolls, cereal, juice, etc). I really don't have any complaints about anything except on our last day we called for a 4:30 am wakeup call so we wouldn't miss our airplane and we never received it ... yes, we did have the alarm clock in the room set, but I wanted to make sure that if the electricity went off, we'd still make it to the plane on time. I'm sure it was just an oversight because we did receive our other wake-up calls throughout the week ... just make sure that you also set your alarm clock if you need to get up early for anything. The complimentary dinner served in the evening was what you would expect for a free dinner - they had spaghetti and garlic bread (we only ate the dinner at the hotel once during our stay because we were busy seeing the sights). I don't like spaghetti so I wasn't impressed but my children and my mom seemed to like it. It was also very nice that the hotel had a washing machine and clothes dryer on the 3rd floor (very helpful since we only had room in our suitcases to pack in 3 days worth of clothing for the 8 days we would be away from home). We also had complimentary hotel shuttles to Universal Studios and Sea World. There was also a shuttle bus that cost $6.00 per person to Disney (much cheaper than the taxi's that we had taken to much closer places). We also used the I-Ride Trolley for $1.00 per person - this was convenient (the trolley stops every 15-20 minutes at each international drive stop) and my kids thought it was cool to ride. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Florida and I would rate it a 4.5 out of 5. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 out of 5 is because I think the housekeeping didn't clean the room quite so well as other hotels during our stay (when we arrived back at the hotel from our day of sight-seeing we still had our used, open bottled water sitting where we left it and a dirty spoon left where we left it on the counter until we finally moved it on the 3rd day). Not a big problem though, because (like I said), when we got there, the room was clean ... and, it was our mess so we just cleaned it up. I'm just used to having full maid service at the hotels I normally stay at ... but, for $134+ tax per night (including free breakfast, free dinner and the free shuttles), I don't think there's room to complain.

I selected it largely due to the favourable reviews on this site. I travel a lot for business and usually find myself in some very nice hotels. That said, I would classify this hotel as one of the best I've stayed in, as it understood its purpose and played it to perfection. In bullet form: The Hotel - the hotel is very clean and nicely painted. No Matisse in the lobby, but friendly staff who actually seem concerned about your enjoyment, without being obsequious. - the hotel offers a complementary hot breakfast buffet each morning. Those hoping for smoked salmon and custom omlettes need to look elsewhere. However, if you have hungry kids there is nothing better than to come out of your room and have immediate scrambled eggs, bacon, cereal, bagels and toast, a selection of juices and wait for it... actually good coffee! Try the make-it-yourself waffles with whipped cream and syrup. Yum! - between 4 and 7 (approx) on Mon-Thurs they have a managers welcome. This is a VERY simple snack/meal, but it is provided with wine or beer... again complementary. After a day of Seaworld we decided to take them up on it. It was pasta with beef stew. It was passable and the kids liked it. The red wine was decent compared to most wine given away. - be aware that other than the above, there is no restaurant in the hotel. This is one nextdoor at the Hilton Garden Inn. - the pool is heated. I mean it.. it is HEATED. It must be about 88F. There is no shock going into it and my littlest son loved his first introduction to a pool. The Rooms - the rooms have a decent kitchen... 2 element stove, dishwasher, full fridge, garborator, microwave, sink, coffee maker, cutlery and dishes for 4, and they include paper towels and dishwasher detergent. Extra garbage bags are left too. - each room has a seperate bedroom with a door between the living room and the bedroom. Closing the door muffles quite well any noise from either TV in both rooms. - beds are very good, firm, but good. Even nicer is they have a choice of pillows on each bed: a down pillow, a puffy foam pillow, and a flatter foam pillow. - noise from other units is very minimal. Despite a reasonably full hotel there was little noise from other rooms. - there is no mini-bar so you'll have to buy your own. I like a beer in the evening, so I was very pleased to see the hotel sold beer by the lobby desk (those non-Quebec Canadians can appreciate this). What really shows the decency of the hotel is that while I've had pay $6 for a beer in ritzy hotel minibars, they sold a beer for $3, or pick 6 for $10. Very reasonable. - by the way the hotel also sells a variety of things consistant with serving people who may be staying there for a while. Any Negatives? - the hotel is faultless, although I must point out you are by International Drive. Having never stayed on this particular piece of road, I was surprised (and kinda revolted) by the crowds, traffic, and overall tackiness of the area. If your diet is only McD, BK, KFC, and IHOP, you'll be very happy. - beware of the pizza offers slipped under your hotel door. We ordered from one and they simply never showed despite 2 hours and repeated calls and promises that \"the guy just left with your order\".

While this may hot be a big thing or perk for some, as someone who has to pay for every minute dialled, it was a nice surprise for me! Overall, the rooms were clean and well kept and we enjoyed use of the kitchen. The hotel is situated close to Universal and was within a 15 minute drive to the Disney Theme parks (we visited during a slower time I think so traffic may pick up during peak times).

The hotel is not very easy to find late at night, as it is rather \"tucked away\" off International Drive. The location of International Drive is very, very touristy and gets very, very crowded on the weekends (especially during Spring Break!). While the hotel itself is rather secluded from the madness that is International Drive, actually maneuvering to the hotel can be tricky. Our room was absolutely fine - the standard \"suite\" with a separate set of doors to close the bedroom area from the sitting area / kitchen. We had 2 double beds which worked perfectly for us -- our kids in 1 bed, the parents in the other. The bathroom was standard size with the toilet and tub in one room and the sink outside of it. Kitchen area was perfect - fullsize refrigerator, dishwasher, stove, oven, microwave (and cooking utensils, plates, etc). The pool area was fine - plenty of clean towels available poolside and a small jaccuzi (6 person, max). I booked my stay online directly through the parent company (Hilton); be sure to keep this information with you as the rate that I had procured was not what they were going to charge me (quoting me more expensive rates) at check-in. Thankfully, I had the hotel confirmation printed out and with me when I checked in and I was able to get the rate I had confirmed. (pamela at the front desk was lovely) The buffet breakfast really exceeded our expectations. Each morning featured different foods, with staples of eggs, waffles, bagels, fruit, cereal and yogurts. As a previous reviewer mentioned, trays were available to bring food back to your room. Saved much $$ on this! We only did one night of the managers reception and it was fantastic. There is a monthly menu available in your room - we had a pasta night and each night will have either caesar or garden salad + pb&j for the kids if they don't like what is being served. (it's buffet style as well). I did laundry quite a few times - the laundry rooms do not have any products for sale - you'll need to bring your own or buy some detergent whilst in FL. Cost is $1 per load to wash and dry (each). 5th floor only had 1 washer, but I never had a problem. In summary, the Homewood Suites is a very nice hotel. However, if you are trying to decide between staying in a Disney hotel or even in the Lake Buena Vista area, this hotel is not for you. There is nothing \"magical\" about this hotel - it's a Homewood Suites in a very crowded, touristy part of Orlando. The hotel itself is lovely, but it's a distance to any Disney attraction. Of course, Universal is right there as is Wet n wild, if that's what you're interested in. If you're purely doing Disney, I'd choose something closer.", "Date": "April 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Braunfels, Texas, United States", "Title": "\u201cGreat Choice for the Orlando Area\u201d", "Author": "VinylSlider", "ReviewID": "UR4995188", "Content": "Our family (two adults, two kids ages 13 and 9) stayed at the Homewood Suites Orlando Universal from March 18-23, 2006.

So we decided to give this hotel a try - we are glad we did. This hotel has so much more to offer. The rooms are split into two (bedroom and sitting room/kitchen) which means more space to spread out your belongings (and gifts!)and gives it more of a homely feel than your typical cheap hotel. The hotel has a very safe feel about it as well as all doors open into an internal corridor and not out onto a walkway outside. The security is very good and mean that no-one can just walk in off the street easily. The breakfast is great and you are spoilt for choice between healthy fruit or pastries or a good old fry-up. The staff are really welcoming and the rooms are very clean. The internet room is free to use for all residents and we found it to be reasonably easy to get onto a terminal to catch up on emails or check the weather (we visited just after Wilma so it was really convenient to see what roads and national parks were closed, the fuel situation, etc). Location is great - 10 minutes walk to Wet n Wild and International Drive. We had a car and found this useful to drive down I-Drive to one of the many restaurants or crazy golf courses along the way. Hotel is less than 5 minutes drive to Universal (although could be walked in about 20 minutes) and is within easy reach of SeaWorld (at the other end of I-Drive) or Interstate 4 to get to DisneyWorld (several miles away).
