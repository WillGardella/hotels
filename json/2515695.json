I asked for a room with a view for our wedding anniversary and was given the last one at the end of a very long hallway, looking towards the highway. Far from the elevator and with a baby in our hands, it made it extra difficult to get to our room! I found long strands of hair in bath tub, so had to cancel baby bath. The next day, for our housekeeping service, we had our bed made, but floor wasn't vacuumed. The Front office supervisor Teresa (the ONLY helpfull person) called later and send houskeeping to re-vacuum the carpet, unfortunately pieces of food were left behind (again) and I had to pick them up myself. Housekeepers at this hotel are somewhat rude and speak very limited English, if any..I asked one (older woman with grey, curly hair) for extra shampoo and towel. She refused to give me any and chased me down to my room to check if I had any bath items already. I didn't let her in, because baby was napping. Also, at breakfast , the server (male) made some inapropriate remarks..Our baby didn't eat much of his plate and my husband appologized for wasting some of the food ...The server's respond: WELCOME TO AMERICA! We felt as though we had been spoken to as if we were children looking for a handout! Very unprofessional! The lack of customer care and disrespect at this hotel will keep guests away.

Everything was nice, clean, and the beds were awesome. I (and my wife) would prefer a normal door to the bathroom as opposed to the sliding door since its hard to keep smells out of the main room with a sliding door, but thats small. However we had more problems. My friends and I came to this hotel for a wedding we were in and we were promised shuttle service to the venue starting at 2pm (wedding starts at 3:30) for our wives since we only had one vehicle. When the girls came down to catch the shuttle, the front desk employee told them that the service wasn't going to start until 4pm. My wife asked for the manager and told them our situation and the manager was rude and not helpful. It got to the point that my wife called me and told me the situation and I felt like it was necessary to call them and let them know that I am a platinum member and this was unacceptable service for what I have come to know from Marriott's, etc... The manager had a change of heart and was very helpful to my wife, but it should not have come to this.

We didn't know Courtyards had suite accommodations, but the kind Teresa wanted us to be extra comfortable. This is an older hotel that was originally built as a Doubletree in the 80's, but has been maintained flawlessly since Marriott's takeover. Everything was absolutely spotless. I guess the only feature that dates the hotel slightly is the use of \"pocket\" doors to enter the bathroom. We enjoyed both dinner (room service) and a knock-your-socks-off buffet breakfast which was complimentary, although I'm not certain whether it was free for us as elite members or is offered to all guests. The cooked-to-order omelet was outstanding and my waffle with the works couldn't have been better. Paying guests were charged $11.95. The breakfast room is beautiful and one could eat al fresco weather permitting.

Check in was very easy and the clerk that checked us in was very nice. Though the property seems like it is a bit older, our room is extremely clean and well kept. We are on the 3rd floor and overlook the pool/hot tub area and just beyond that is a beautifully landscaped man made lake. The hotel is very nice and kind of off the beaten path. Our room has a mini fridge and microwave in it. The bathroom has a pocket door instead of a regular door. The beds are a bit firm for my taste, but that's a personal opinion. I still sleep very good. The hotel has been very quiet except for one night (a Saturday), there was a group of young people coming in from what looked like a wedding party. They were a bit loud for about 5-10 minutes, but I never heard them after that. We have not eaten at the restaurant in the hotel so I can't comment on that. We have used the outdoor hot tub and it was wonderfully relaxing. It was about 58-60 degrees outside but once we got in the hot tub, we were nice and cozy. Both the hot tub and pool are very clean, but it was a bit too cold for the pool even though it is heated. I only have two complaints about this hotel. The first is that I rarely see anyone at the front desk. During peak times, like early morning before 10am, I have seen an employee, but later in the day and even at night, I don't see anyone. They may be in the office just off to the side of the main desk, but I'm not sure. The second is that the water pressure in the shower is great, however, it comes out so hard that it actually can be painful. Plus, I'm about 5'3\" and my husband is about 5'8\" and the shower head is very low, as is the ceiling. Not a big deal to me, but if you're taller than my husband, this could be an issue. We have been to SeaWorld and the San Diego Zoo and it took us about 20-25 minutes depending on traffic. This area is beautiful and it is in a business park. There are several restaurants in the area (Coco's, Denny's, etc.) There is also a post office and several banks and gas stations in the area.

RB is about a half hour north of San Diego, a very easy freeway drive to La Jolla, or Mission Bay, or downtown. I figured it was better to stay at a nice reasonable place than a cheap dump. Rancho Bernardo is a beautiful upscale suburb. The hotel has FREE PARKING (a big plus), and isn't too big (another plus). The staff was uniformly nice--everyone from the front desk to housekeeping. They offer you a $5 a day discount if you choose not to have housekeeping clean your room, and I took that offer and used the money to pay for the EXCELLENT BUFFET BREAKFAST ($11). I don't change my sheets at home every day, and I don't need at a hotel either. It's also greener--and more private. When I wanted clean towels, I could get them from the housekeeping carts or the front desk. The room's design was fresh and modern, with built-in furniture, walls in gold and green, and a VERY COMFORTABLE BED AND LOTS OF PILLOWS. Everything was SPOTLESS. The room was VERY QUIET despite facing the freeway (but far enough away from it). I never heard noise from another room. The POOL AND JACUZZI ARE CLEAN and supply their own towels. At $109 a night, this is an EXCELLENT VALUE. There were a wide variety of people staying there, from families to people all dressed up for weddings--so anybody should feel comfortable here. So, you have a nice room, good bed, good restaurant, good pool, pleasant staff, free parking--and it's also close to a variety of restaurants as well as a 24-hour supermarket/pharmacy.

The room was a very nice size, it was extremely clean and the bed was the best out of three hotels we stayed at on the trip, and that's coming from a pregnant woman!

The pool and jacuzzi are clean and just right. Lots of laying out space. Great looking lounge, although I didn't find much time to do any of that. The sheets really smelled like Bleach. But very comfy. There is a fridge and safe and good drawer and closet space. HBO and good WiFi. The Bathroom had great Shower pressure (very important!). I found an extra pillow in the second drawer. The San Bernardo Winery is up the road a very short drive and a Must Do! Wine tasting (Riesling...YUM!) and a glass blowing shop and a GREAT restaurant. Oh, and a Winery too!

Was not disappointed! Very friendly staff at the front desk greeted us, parking was plentiful (though the spots were traditional 'hotel small', so many large cars and SUVs end up taking 2 spots), and most importantly, the room smelled clean - not overpowering sanitizer or carpet deodorizer 'clean', just a genuine non-musty, nothing bad has been laying around non-scent. The dried up pizza crumbs underneath the TV stand/desk area can be forgiven as the rest of the room was in good order. Other positives were the supportive mattresses, abundance of different pillows, the very powerful shower pressure (so strong my spouse complained she couldn't modify it lower but I loved it) and the cleaning staff 'tucking in' my kids stuffed animals. Also, the kids liked the ducks by the 'lake' but they were too domesticated for me as they expect to be fed by every human they see and come way too close for their own safety. The pool and hot tub were standard, nice and clean but (I assume it was) the sprinklers soak all the chairs at some point in the evening. There are many things relatively close - Vons, cafes, gas stations and a Denny's up the street. Also a small shopping center called Mercado with a new Vietnamese restaurant that had one of the best bowls of Pho I've ever tasted - if you're into that sort if thing. The main attractions are mostly a decent drive away but the hotel is right next to the highway so easy navigation.
