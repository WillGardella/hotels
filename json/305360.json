{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good Value - But don't expect too much! We've stayed at the Bishop a number of times this year the latest being December this year. Located on Robinson road near to the escalator and just above Soho  LKF, the Bishop is very conveniently located to Central Hong Kong. It's currently under a well deserved renovation but if your out during the day, this shouldn't affect you too much. Like all Hong Kong hotels, the rooms are pretty small. We usually booked a suite which for the extra money was well worth it as we ended up with a separate lounge room and bedroom.

We had to cancel our last night (due to airport problems in Bangkok we had to change flights and plans), but trying tospeak to the staff about this was very difficult. We had to insist on talking to a manager as we kept being told no to getting our money back for our cancelled night (minus deposit). We were told a manager did not work on Mondays so my husband had to raise his voice to ask for a manager, then one suddenly appeared and helped us sort out the problem.On our second night we came back to our two rooms (on same floor but different sides of building) to discover that our soft comfortable beds had been replaced with hard smaller beds. Once again we had problems getting a manager to sort out the problem and to get an explanation. They told us that one of the beds had a stain so they changed all the beds?????? Not sure why really.

The hotel is situated in a very accessible location from the airport (subway and quick taxi ride) and to all the shopping/food/nightlife. However, I thought this hotel could use a little better customer service, especially at the front desk. I know it may be a budget hotel, but it doesn't excuse poor service (see below for specifics).PROS1. Great location2. Good price, relative to other hotels in Hong Kong3. CleanCONS1. Front desk customer service - The front desk folks in the evening hardly looked up from their computers when we checked in and asked questions. The front desk folks in the daytime actually cared to look up at us, but were quite rude and gave us an unnecessarily hard time when we tried to confirm our previously requested late check-out. In the end, the front desk people from the evening and day shifts miscommunicated our request. However, we received no apology. Just a reluctant agreement to let us check out an hour later. Kind of left a sour taste in our mouth. 2. Construction - Don't know how long they're working on the hotel, but they didn't seem to care that they had guests in the rooms adjacent to the construction site. We heard drilling all day, starting bright and early in the morn. 3. Tiny rooms - But it's Hong Kong and you get what you pay for right? At least it's clean. Aside from these 3 cons, 2 of which might be isolated incidents, the hotel is a good bang for your buck. I may look into coming here again if I want to stay around this location.", "Date": "Dec 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR487510563", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "avocadogreen"}, {"Content": "your best bet for civilized budget accommodation in HK I'm in HK 6-7 times a year on business, and always stay at the BL (and have done for more than 4 years now, as have most of my work colleagues). The hotel is renovating their rooms which prompted this review. The rooms are small, Tokyo-sized, but clean and fairly well-maintained. The staff are professional and polite. The location is in the mid-levels, a residential neighbourhood, but only a 5 minute cab ride (or free shuttle) from the business area, or a 15 minute walk up or down the mid-levels escalator (a string of connected escalators that take you from office-land to sort-of-suburbia). The room rate is a fraction of the big-name hotels in town - not quite hostel-cheap, but very affordable. The internet is free and fast, and the beds are comfortable with good duvets. There's a kettle and cups in the room (a must-have as far as I'm concerned).If you get a harbour-view room (you'll have to pay a bit more, BL's not that generous on upgrades 'cos they're usually full) the view over Central towards Kowloon is stunning. The renovated rooms, apart from having a fresh makeover, have bigger showerheads, shaving mirrors, small flat-screen TVs, and bigger beds (not much of an advantage as the rooms are no bigger, obviously, so there's less space for your luggage!)What do you give up for the price? Breakfast is average and you're better off grabbing something on the go outside the hotel. The pool is a dipping pond, no point actually trying to swim, and the gym is token. There are no bathrooms, only shower rooms. And you occasionally find the modest-sized lobby crammed full of mainland Chinese tour groups.But given that, in HK, you're likely to be out and about 18 hours a day, and all you really need is a smile, a room, and a bed, BL scores very highly for value for money.", "Date": "Jul 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR189502634", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "hoboesque"}, {"Content": "Very Nice Stay       View from Bishop Lei Room", "Date": "Jul 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR143236572", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "jma-adc"}, {"Content": "just so-so I was looking for an affordable base of operations in central/western Hong Kong island.

On both occasions the hotel represented fantastic value for money, especially as I obtained a breakfast inclusive rate with Expedia. Note that however you book, an extra 10% service charge will be added to the bill.Rooms 1710 (standard double peak view) and 305 (standard single city view) were both clean and adequately furnished. Room sizes are similar to other Hong Kong hotels and are fine for me (but there again there is only me to fit in the room). Good desk with bright light for working if necessary. One minor draw back \u9225?the mini-safe is too small to fit even the smallest laptop into, however the free wireless broadband works well with speeds of around 500 kbit/sec. TV has good selection of English language tv channels including BBC World  CNN.There is a reasonable breakfast buffet 07:00 to 10:00 with eggs cooked fresh to order, but is a little pricey if not on a BB rate.As others have commented, the location near the top of the mid-levels escalator makes for a more peaceful location than say Kowloon, and the mid-levels plus adjacent soho district contain the majority of Hong Kong\u9225\u6a9a western restaurants if Chinese food isn\u9225\u6a9b to your taste.

The Harbor View Suite sounds great from other reviews, however after booking online and paying a premium rate, I was offered a room on the 3rd Floor with no harbor view (i.e. no water visible only the backs of the buildings in front of the Hotel). I finally got a room on the 9th floor after a lot of discussion. I could at least see a tiny part of the harbor. My advice is to make sure to secure a room higher up in advance, otherwise its not worth the time and effort of coming up the hill if you don't have a room with a view.The location is a long way back up the hill even by bus or escalator if you need to pop back to the hotel for anything during the day.The location also has its advantages with easy access to Soho, via the mid-level escalators. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel door which links with the MTR. Its not too far to walk to the Peak from here - however none of the staff knew the path to the peak - so we found it ourselves!

Large TV, quiet airconditioning, floor to ceiling windows, crisp white duvets, down pillows and shuttle to take us almost anywhere. We are using the mid level escalators, but I can imagine that in August, it would get tiresome. We used the hotel organized limousine service to get here. Very simple, nice and reasonable. The breakfast buffet this morning was passable for the price ($260 for 3 ) . Hotel has nice exercise facilities, but the pool is closed for maintenance. It is so nice walking along Robinson street, and easy to get to just about anywhere. Very close to the Zoo and Botanical gardens (we can see the animal enclosures below) We booked a non-smoking room, but arrived at 7 a.m. and were offered a smoking room.

Yes, you have to step outside to change your mind in the small rooms. Yes, they're basic. But they're clean, comfortable, and for $500HKD/night ($65US) you cannot touch it anywhere else in Hong Kong.
