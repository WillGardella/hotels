My trip was to attend a funeral at Pere Lachaise Cemetery and I would recommend anyone who is walking to attend a service there note that the Le crematorium building is closer to Metro Gambetta than Charonne station. If you start your walk at the Charonne end then its cobble stones, so you might like to consider your footwear. I had dinner at Noy Noy, a Thai restaurant just around the corner from the hotel. The meal was exceptional, but I would recommend if you are a party of more than 1, to book as it was packed.

We had a really brilliant time here but I have rated it as average as I believe that is what it is. The two biggest \"issues\" I had with the place, 1) No tea or coffee making facilities in the room. If you think that a coffee is between 3 - 5 Euros a pop this would have been a god send each morning. You can get as many coffees as you like for breakfast for 10 Euros but it's not the same as being able to have one any time without feeling ripped off! The breakfast is ok, you can eat as much as you like but it is nothing special, however when you factor in the cost of drinks in Paris it is much more cost effective to have it in the hotel than out. Even if you got a coffee & a pastry at a bar you won't get such good value. The other isssue I had was the fact there was no air con. For us this was fine as it was March but one night it was quite hot & you just can't open the patio doors or windows as the traffic noise is immense. However, on the street you are opposite a lovely little Italian Deli, there is a fromagerie, two brilliant patiesseries. (The one up the street is the best for bread but the one nearest the Boulevard Voltaire made the most amazing pastries I've ever had in my life) There is a Halal butcher that cooks rotisserie chickens which were also superb. You can get most anything you need food/drink/pharmacy wise in the Rue De Charonne! The room was small, the bed comfy & the bathroom beyond tiny, but the staff were lovely, very friendly & helpful & being so close to the Metro was great after a long day out pounding the streets. Can't say I'll be back for sure but if we want something cheap in the Winter we'd probably go back.

I had already paid for the Eurostar and hotel package, but he wouldn't believe me, saying '99% of the time guests pay on checkout'.

We had the voucher from the travel agency but no reservation was found. The hotel was full, we were told. The woman at the desk tried to call the local branch of the travel agency but it was closed on the weekend. She called around and found a room for us at a nearby hotel, the Grand Hotel Dore. The woman took our voucher & copied it, said they would follow up since it appeared to have been booked and we had paid for it. She said they would pay the Hotel Dore for our stay since they would be paid by the agency. I have posted a review for the Hotel Dore separately. Once we got checked into the other hotel, I was able to use my cell phone to call the travel agency back in the states once they opened. They spoked to the Classics Hotel and confirmed with them our move. Our agency was quick to ask if we were satisfied with the new hotel (as it was not one of their hotels). We were very satisfied but our agency said if we wanted, to let them know if we wished to be moved & they would find us another hotel. (As a side note the day after we moved to the new hotel, the Classic called us and said they had a cancellation and could take us back. We thanked them for their offer but since we had already unpacked and gotten settled in, we said we would stay where we were.) We had stayed in the area of the Classics hotel before & had been looking forward to returning to Blvd Voltaire but found the new neighborhood very nice.

Whilst no major 'icons' or 'landmarks' are nearby to the hotel (you'll pay through the nose to be anywhere near something famous), it is only a 3 minute walk from the Charonne metro station on the 9 line, which we found to be extremely convenient to pretty much anywhere we wanted to go to. Unless you're rich and take taxis everywhere no matter where you stay in Paris you'll be using the metro constantly, so it doesn't really matter if you are a little bit out of the 'heart' of the tourist attractions. Nearby are plenty of cafes, supermarkets and convenience stores so you'll always have things handy within a few minutes walk. The room was a reasonable size without being particularly big, and also had a balcony facing the street. It was however a bit noisy outside, and it didn't have air conditioning so we always slept with the fan on even though it we only had (disappointingly) mild weather despite being summer. If you stay there during a really hot summer I think the room would become quite uncomfortably warm, with no choice but to open the balcony doors for cool air and the accompanying noise. There was no fridge in the room, however there was a safe. Internet was provided free of charge which is always handy, and so was a decent continental breakfast which included corn flakes, yoghurt, juice, fruit and pastries. All reception staff were very friendly and always willing to answer questions.

The little place next door wasn't bad either if you just want some basic cheap food and you're too lazy to walk anywhere else.", "Date": "May 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shrewsbury, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBetter Hotels in Paris\u201d", "Author": "SamandGus", "ReviewID": "UR16507479", "Content": "We booked this hotel after reading the Reviews here but were disappointed. I have visited Paris several times in the last ten years and know there are better alternatives. There was nothing wrong with the Hotel as such but would i recommend it to a friend - No, would i book it again - No. We had a delux room which i think differed from the standard rooms in that it was at the back of the hotel so wasn't overlooking the street, also we had tea making facilities although there was no coffee, no milk and only three teabags [one of which was earl grey tea] and noticed for one morning the maid had not replaced them so there was no tea that day. I wanted a hotel in Bastille because i love the area [fab for restautants/bars/cafes etc] but this hotel is definitely situated in the shabbier part of Bastille. The front of the Hotel is also shabbier than the pictures you can view online. We did not have the breakfast, preferring to grab a pain au chocolat and coffee en route so cannot comment on that but viewing it in the morning as we left there didn't seem anything terribly special about it. The bathroom had recently been renovated i think but had no bath, also there were no towel rails so you were forced to have them replaced on a daily basis. As from previous reviews here the staff were polite but unenthusiastic, also there were daily papers, sometimes out of date, but who wants to read an english paper whilst on holiday in a foreign country, so would not consider this a selling point? The room was very clean which does count for a lot, but the beds, whilst comfortable had rubber undersheets which seemed insulting and didn't aid a restful nights sleep. Overall Paris was as fantastic as always, a real find is a restaurant just around the corner on Cite de Phalsbourg called les pissenlits par la racine; it is a real local restaurant [wine came out of a box in a cupboard and the music was provided by an iPod plugged into speakers], the bowls of salad are a MUST [and thats from someone who doesn't usually eat rabbit food!] and the waiter is brilliant - he stood and did Goat impressions in the middle of the place when we asked what Chevre was, who says french waiters are bad tempered?! My advice, book another hotel! PS. if anyone knows what happened to Jim Morrison's grave pease put it in a Review!", "Date": "May 30, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Classics Hotel Bastille", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d296375-Reviews-Classics_Hotel_Bastille-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$127 - $320*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">131, rue de Charonne</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">11th Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75011</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "296375", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/dd/57/bf/jardin-classics-hotel.jpg"}}
