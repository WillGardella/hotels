We booked the accommodation at Kings Inn on the same web site where we purchased the Balboa Park Stay-for-the-Day Passes. We prepaid the accommodation and Passes and received a confirmation email showing nothing was due at check in at the hotel (the email clearly showed $0 due at check-in in black and white). We arrived at approximately 4:45 p.m. after spending a very relaxing day at the museums and attempted to book in for our stay. The staff informed us that they would need to place a charge against our credit card for $25 as a security deposit. We told them that this particular card was \u201cmaxed out\u201d and that we would prefer to pay the deposit in cash. They refused and said that they did not handle cash at all and that their policy is to charge a card. My wife pointed out to them that they had a sign up that said they accepted cash upon check out, presumably for outstanding balances. The assistant, Ana, said that they could not complete the check in without charging the card regardless of this fact. I asked to see the manager but was told that she was not available. When I asked why they then had a sign on the counter that said \"Manager on Duty\", they again just said she was unavailable; no explanation, no reasonable \u201cshe had to step out to deal with a family emergency\u201d or something like that, just No. When we showed them that our confirmation e-mail showed that nothing was due at check in at the hotel, she just said it is wrong and started reading through the fine print to find a loophole. When she could not find anything, she said that the booking agent was wrong and simply went back to her \u201cI won\u2019t budge on this\u201d position. I entirely understand that they wanted to charge a security deposit to ensure that they can cover minor, accidental damages to a room or property if something happened. I have stayed in a *lot* of hotels, both domestically and internationally and I have never, not once, had damage to a room or hotel property. Yet, I do not have a problem with them wanting to cover their bases just in case and we were entirely willing to pay the deposit, just in cold, hard cash not a charge to the card. Instead, because of their inflexibility and refusal to see reason on something this absurd, we decided to have them reverse the room charge back to our card and drive the hour and a bit back home and go out for dinner to our favorite sushi restaurant instead. It amazes me how customer service has deteriorated to the point where someone would turn good business away because of a policy that nobody would dare to think logically about with sense and reason. Because of this, they lost a night's room revenue, as well as whatever we would have paid for dinner, for no good reason. To make it worse there was no manager that we could talk to and we were simply turned away point blank. No discussion, no reasonableness, no customer service, period. Even the travel agent we booked the hotel and purchased the Balboa Passes through was shocked when we phoned them to confirm that the hotel reversed the room charges; the agent said she has never heard of something like this and would be taking it up with her manager as well because it may reflect badly on their services. Other reviewers have posted similar reviews at a different review site about being turned away last year, I cannot help but think this is something that has been happening for a while and they have not seen the need to change it. We come to San Diego relatively frequently because we live about a 90 minutes' drive north and find it is a great place to go for impulsive, short notice breakaways for romantic or de-stressing weekend getaways. It is a downright shame how bad customers are treated these days because nobody is allowed to think anymore, especially in this economy. I wonder what their policy would have been had we been international travelers using just traveler\u2019s checks. My advice to all travelers would be to look elsewhere and stay far away from bad customer service like this. I am sure that Kings Inn might possibly have lived up to the good reviews on several web sites that we saw, but we definitely did not see it or have the chance to experience it. Stay away and take your business elsewhere.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Value & Fantastic Staff\u201d", "Author": "Jenmccann72", "ReviewID": "UR127762897", "Content": "Stayed here with my 7 year old twins over spring break.

Best of all, the pool is actually heated to a comfy temperature.....I get really tired of hotel pools reminiscent of the film \"Ice Station Zebra\" but this one is wonderfully warm at least most of the year. The beds are not \"lumpy\" but are very comfy, though the pillows are tired, to be polite. One big caution is that the bathroom is verrrrry cramped, with tight access--the property cant change this, as even most mid-century houses had smaller bathrooms than one finds now--just be prepared, as there is no way to accomodate a wheelchair, at least in the rooms I have had, for example. Parking runs through the complex, so one is usually parked close to the room. Yes, there is a computer in the Lobby for Guest use......kinda chintzy as most properties have a computer that is free for guests, but this one costs and it's cash only. The big \"BUT\" is that the rooms do not have refrigerators, and so many competitors now do supply an in-room refrig.

As you can tell by the name, it is an inn not a hotel. I wasn't expecting it to be any better than 3 stars but surprisingly, it was better than the last motel I stayed at. Please read my prior review for more details. What attracted me was the manager's special during the weekdays. A king size bed with pool view was 50% off plus you you get coupons to their own restaurants. Like most other hotels, this inn is pretty close to the freeway but I did not hear any noise from my room. The pool and jacuzzi are heated. Even though I didn't go in, I did put my hand into the pool to make sure the the water is heated as advertised on their website. The room was fair with heating and ac by the window. However, air unit is automatic once you set your temperature on the digital thermostat. There is a small coffee table with two lounge chairs and a ceiling light hanging right above it. It simulates a bistro or a lounge. There is a fair size flat panel TV, most likely LCD, with basic cable. The bathroom is not so spacious. Tub shower and toilet is in its separate room while the sink is outside. Other amenities such as hair dryer, ice, vending machines, basic cable, and wifi is present. When I come down to San Diego, I don't plan to spend much time in the hotel. I spend most of the time doing things and going places, and the hotel is just a place for me to put my luggage and rest through the night. That's why I don't need an expensive place to sleep. I would recommend this place for people who just need a night rest with little noise, fairly inexpensive, and close proximity to many popular sites. With the special, I paid less than $60 per night and that includes all taxes. I hope you see this review helpful.

Don't get me wrong, the staff upon check-in was nice. I know others have stated how friendly the staff is. No problems there. However, there is no way this hotel should be listed as 3 star. They try to pass their antiquated furniture of as \"Vintage Classic Style\". It just means the owner is too cheap to upgrade his furniture from the 70's. The TV is a small 25\" that was also purchased decades ago. They don't even provide the standard amenities that ANY quality hotel should provide. There was no iron and ironing board in the room (and it took them an hour to bring me one), there is no in-room coffee service, and there wasn't even a remote control for the Television (apparently there was supposed to be, but when I asked for one to be brought up to my room I was told they didn't have one to bring me).

We needed a budget hotel that was close to Sea World and the San Diego Zoo. Based on price, location and others' reviews, I chose King's Inn. I was perfectly satisfied with the choice. First off, if you are looking for a luxury room, this is not it. Like other posters have said, the bathroom is small. In fact, if you are a person of size, you might have trouble shutting the door while you are sitting on the toilet. The showerhead is curiously low (I'm only 5'5\" and it was short for me) and the water pressure leaves something to be desired. That being said, what was more important to me is cleanliness, and the bathroom was clean. The rooms are dated and the TV is small, but we were not there to hang around in the room all day. The rooms are clean (no sign of bed bugs---I checked!) and I found the beds to be firm but comfy. The front desk staff as well as the restaurant staff (we dined at both in-hotel restaurants: the Amigo Spot and the Waffle Spot) were very friendly and accomodating. We didn't really get a chance to use the pool (too cold at night when we were around), but the hot tub was nice.

One night there was a noisy person outside yelling a bunch, but other than that, the other guests were respectful. There was a mix of both younger folks and older couples as well as few families like ours.

But, this hotel is definitely a cut above other 2 and 3-star facilities. This hotel is the third or fourth oldest in Mission Valley, according to the manager. Built around 1960, its decor is dated, but that is also what gives this venue its charm. More importantly, the rooms are very clean and the staff is exceptionally dedicated to providing its customers with friendly service. We were initially assigned a room in one of the attached buildings. However, the room had a musty odor (possibly due to recent flooding following unusually heavy rains) and was cramped for our family of three. For an additional $10/night we were able to have a room in the main building, which one enters from the inside. (Rooms in the attached buildings are entered directly from outdoors.) This made a huge difference, particularly since it was cool and rainy during much of our stay. Due to special dietary needs, we did not eat in the restaurants, but, for an extra $5/day, we were able to have a refrigerator in the room, which was larger than the usual cube-sized models. The beds were comfortably firm (no significant sagging) and the shower was outstanding. However, this is not a fancy hotel: there are few electrical outlets in the rooms; there is no counter in the bathrooms in the main building on which to place toiletries, and there is no elevator to the second floor. The toilet is an old-style, slow-flush, which often requires two or three flushes to remove paper. Still, for the price paid, these are minor inconveniences. Staff at the reservation desk offered to carry luggage up the steps for me (not needed) and were as knowledgeable as any concierge about how to get to local venues. If you are intent on finding a plush hotel you should look elsewhere; but if you would like to save your money for sightseeing and dining, a clean, comfortable hotel, with a friendly staff, without having to pay high rates, this hotel is the place to go. There is also free Wi-Fi in all of the rooms.

I wish that I would have spent more money. First thing to consider is that there is no free breakfast, which I knew, but paying for breakfast every morning adds up and breakfast at the hotel is not cheap. There have been rave reviews about the breakfast on property, but I found it average and overpriced. We went to the local Denny's which was better and less expensive. Bottom line is factor in the price of breakfast when making your decision on which hotel to stay at if you are on a budget. So, check-in went well. We checked in at about 1030pm and were the only ones in there and were treated nicely. Went to the room and found that it had a wired smell. Probably because it was old and outdated. The chairs were so stained and filthy that if they were in my house they would have been placed in the trash years ago. The television was small and old, the and the bathroom had no ventilation. The linens seemed to be clean and the housekeeping service was good. Something that was hard to get past was the filthy carpets! We have two little kids who like to roll around and play on the floor and it was gross. No joke if you walked around barefoot and stood in the bathtub there would be black...I mean black footprints. I also saw the biggest bug on the floor and it crawled beneath the bed before I could get it. It seriously looked like something in an alien movie. It was 4 inches long and fast, didn't tell my wife or she would have freaked out. Kids love the pool, but this pool was cold and tasted like salt water. We went once and I could not handle a second try. There were some sketchy patrons at the hotel. Hate to say it but I would not be surprised if more than a few drug deals occurred there during our stay. The location was not bad. It was right off of the highway and seemed to be a safe location near many other hotels. There is a general store about a mile away to buy some food if you want, but there is no place in the room to keep the food cold. So, in closing if all I said would not bother you then stay there. I do plan on going to San Diego again, but I promise you that I will not stay there again. I will gladly pay the extra money to stay at a nicer and cleaner place.

To get an iron & hairdryer I had to go to the front desk - Looked like these items have been through a couple wars. We really didn't feel comfortable staying in those beds after looking over the rest of the room -- but it was late so we got some sleep, on top of the covers. The next morning I immediately went online and found a different hotel, I drove down to the Ramada Plaza (only 1/4 mile down the road) and they let me view the rooms before making the reservation. We checked out of the Kings Inn and called Orbitz for a refund. The rest of the stay @ Ramada Plaza was very nice, and very affordable.

I should also say, I was thankful for the room being non-smoking!

Of course, it also says in small writing \"we'll forward your requests to the property, but there's no guarantee the request will be honored.\" Nice.

Here was another odd thing, when I was checking in, I went outside to get the license plate number for our car and I couldn't get back into the office because they had locked the door since it was after 11 PM. The chick who was helping me wasn't really paying attention, so there I stood, knocking on the door, trying to get back in to complete the check-in process. It just seemed to me that they could have either waited until everyone who was checking in were done or have the person who locked the door stand at the door until everyone was done. Plus, the chick who was checking me in was all pissy because whoever was supposed to be coming on shift was somewhere else taking a personal call on her cell phone.

The restaurants, Waffle Spot and Amigo Spot, good standard of food but a little bit pricey, but that seems standard in San Diego is pricey food.

The trolley is quick and efficient and with the bus and trolley you can be at Old Town transit station in as little as 15 minutes (for more buses and other trolley lines as well as Old Town State park) Old Town state park is great, loads of cool little shops for mexican style souveniers and good food to be found there as well.

It was a total dump! I stay in San Diego a lot (I mean A LOT) and have stayed at a lot of mediocre hotels and a few nice ones... but this was neither. This place is like some Tijuana nightmare. What do I mean by that? Read more below... First, the staff were unfriendly and almost resented having to work. That was the first tip off that something was wrong. The second tip off was the strange smell in the lobby. A super disgusting and cheap room deodorizer that smelled like it came from the 99cent store (in some flavor like LILAC or something very old smelling and too floral). Awful. Okay, I was tired and needed a place to stay and couldn't get on the internet. So I was a walk in. The outside of the place is deceptively retro and tropical. The inside is nothing like that! MAJOR mistake going here. I paid almost a hundred dollars for a room (using AAA -- who by the way should NOT be recommending this dump to anyone!). I was totally ripped off. After I changed rooms from a room that was next to the noisy freeway and which had a window that opened up to a blank wall (nice architecture! .... NOT !)... I was then given a room that was worse. I was told it would be a King and it was a double queen. I was tired and didn't feel like changing rooms again. Started to unpack, went to the bathroom. Saw massive peeling paint and mice feces! (took a photo) There were also strange stains on the carpet that splashed up onto the closet mirrors (and which seemed like it had been there for a while). Unbelievable! No, I am NOT kidding! I tried to ignore it and NOT walk around barefoot for obvious reasons. The room smelt horrible too. Like somebody had died in there. But housekeeping had obviously sprayed OVER the smell with that same gag-inducing air freshner from the lobby! I woke up at 2 am and was choking on the smell and physically got ill from it -- so I had to open a window to air the room out. I KNOW somebody had to have died in this room. It was THAT smell. Horrible. I went down to the soda machine area by the pool to get a soda to calm my stomach and was ripped off by BOTH soda machines which stole my quarters! I finally got one soda after paying for TWO. Obviously someone has rigged the machine to drop coins down into the machine and not into the proper coin area (I noticed this only after I had put in the coins). I know! This is unbelievable. But this is what kind of place this is!I feel COMPELLED to warn people to say away from here! Absolute nightmare in every respect. This is a hotel room that is going for around a hundred bucks too (but should be about $10 for what you get). Total dive. Terrible decor. No coffee maker. No iron even! Dinky little towels that are more like bath cloths and just absolutely unclean and smelly. DO NOT STAY HERE! Unless you are a transient, homeless person or someone who has absolutely no standards. It isn't even the bare bones no nonsense kind of hotel for a tired person for one night. Go to the Vagabond down the street for that (at least that one is CLEAN and the people are friendly). If you have any sense at all and want to enjoy a NICE San Diego hotel, you are going to have to spend a bit more money and go to a different part of town. This place is pure Tijuana standards. Fine for Mexico maybe, but not for San Diego. Oh and this is good. I overheard a girl say that someone's car was carjacked in the lot the same night I was there! Yes! Believe it. Not a safe area.

The hotel is easy to find, just off highway 8 interstate 163. On hotel circle which is signposted on the highway. The reception staff are very helpful. They were excellent when we checked in and gave us some discount vouchers for the Waffle Spot & Amigo. He also gave us a voucher for Macy's giving us 11% off for the five days we were there. We asked for directions a few times while there and each time they gave us a little card with exact directions from the hotel to the place. This was excellent and a really good touch. The room. Pros: Basic but clean. Comfy bed. Thick curtains, quiet, good size, air con. Cons: TV reception wasn't the best. Air con a little noisy. The bathroom door didn't shut properly The pool was large and during the day was really quiet. It did get a little noisy in evening, and is open until 10 so you might want to ask for a room away from it. The Waffle spot had basic food, however service is very slow. They have internet pc's that you need to pay for by the minute .25c for 5 mins. About a few min drive away there are two great shopping malls, Fashion Valley & Mission Valley. These have different styles of shops. The former having the more expensive ones but were both excellent. There is a cinema at the latter one. We went to these malls most evenings as open until 9pm.

The Hotel itself was a bit tricky to find from I8, especially if you followed the hotel circle signs, we found it easier coming off on the following Taylor St exit. If you are staying on the Hotel Circle it is definately an advantage to have a car. Taxis cost about $20 to Downtown and the beach areas although there is a bus stop right outside the hotel. On the plus side the hotel reception staff themselves were very helpful and gave us quite a few tips on activities in the area. The onsite restaurant The Waffle Spot was also a good place to have breakfast. The pool and hot tub area also looked quite nice although we never had time to use it.
