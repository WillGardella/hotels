On the not so plus side, the refrigerator wouldn't get below 50 degrees and we had to get another trucked upstairs and installed so our food wouldn't spoil. According to a staff member, this happens all the time. Also, the leather(?) on the loveseat's arms was completely worn off on one corner in our room, exposing the dirty interior. We also didn't appreciate the giant fan-fueled air freshener in the lobby hidden behind the ATM machine. It blasted our face full of overpowering fragrance every time we approached the elevators in the lobby.

My husband and I stayed here for 10 days because I had to attend a conference downtown. In a nutshell, here were our problems: 1). Broken fridge for the entire stay (was replaced eventually... with a equally broken refridgerator!! I wouldn't have been so mad if we hadn't bought a bunch of perishables for the week that we had to throw out). The second time we called, the maintenance guy told us he'd be right back... and never came back. The third time (after 4 hours), the guy told us he'd look for a new fridge... Never came back. The fourth time the desk said they'd send someone up, but they never did. 2) On our last day, we woke up to NO WATER!! We couldn't brush our teeth, shower, or use the bathroom..... When we tried to call to find out what was the problem, nobody ever answered. We'd had so many problems thus far, we decided to just forgo the shower and get the heck out. At checkout, no appologies were made, no explanations were given... and absolutely no discount offered. Really?? The hotel charges $160/night and they don't feel it necessary to provide running water? Seriously... DON'T stay here. Other issues: the staff was less than friendly the entire week. At check in, they asked for a credit card and I gave them one, asking why they needed it since the room was paid in full in advance. I specifically asked whether they intended to charge a deposit, and I was told NO. Well, the next morning I discovered $350.00 had been charged to my creditcard. The front desk admitted it was their mistake and told me.... \"Sorry about that, the girl who told you that is new. Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do to get you your money back, and if you check out early you'll lose the $ you pre-paid for the room. If you had brought a car with you, I'd offer you free parking.\" Well that helps now doesn't it. Half my spending money is now unavailable to me, but I get to park my imaginary car for free!!! I wouldn't have been upset to put a deposit down, that's pretty common. I was mad because the girl lied to my face. Furthermore, it was not mentioned anytime.... I went back through the fine print (priceline, etc) and I was never told that I would need to put a deposit down. Still would have been okay if the girl hadn't lied to me and then refused to do anything about it. As for the rest of the stuff: the cookies were cold (I've seen a lot of people ask about that... it was the least of my concern but they do boast \"warm\"); the hot tub was not hot and the pool seemed nice, but we didn't jump in because the weather was rainy/overcast. The resteraunt staff were equally as rude, and the breakfast buffet consisted of runny scrambled eggs, soggy potatoes and pancakes, cold coffee, and assorted breads and yogurt. Not exactly worth the $15.00 they'll charge you for it. We ordered pizza once (up to our room), It cost us $20 and arrived cold. I wish we would have called Domino's or something. I thought it was super gross and wouldn't recommend that, either. We tried to hit up the happy hour, and the waitress who greeted us had no idea what was on the happy hour specials... Nice. When we finally did figure it out, the food we had (chicken wings and flautas) was pretty good! cleanliness: Actually, it was decently Clean! For the most part, anyway. Wouldn't rave about it, but it wasn't scary to sleep in the beds and I never saw any bugs. Considering the rest of our trip, I'd say the cleanliness was the highlight of our stay. The cleaning crew came almost every day... They'd empty the trash, make the beds and wipe off the counters. They didn't replace our sheets ever, and didn't replace our drinking cups when they \"cleaned\". We had to call down to get extra toilet paper and soap when we ran out, which took forever because of the front desk's wonderful service. At least the water was still working at that point. Needless to say, please take heed and consider my mistake before you book! I had read a few bad reviews about this place before I booked it, and I wish I would have listened. Locatation: On a side note it was very difficult to access downtown from this hotel's location. Their is a bus system that can get you there if you're willing to take several hours and buy multiple transfer or all day passes, but it isn't at all convenient. I didn't feel safe taking it at night, although I've lived in big cities such as D.C. and Miami. Taxis will cost you $20.00 each way, unless they take the round about ways as did our first driver.

Hotel was in a good location - easy drive to downtown and seaworld and the beaches. I loved the idea of a family suite which is the main reason I booked this hotel. There was some extra space for our toddler to run around and play, and she loved sitting at the kids table for drawing and snacks. But moving on to the cons, its not really a full 2 room suite. Cons Family Suite = Kid-used = was showing wear. We had the prior mentioned red stained carpet in our room. It looks like red markers or paints from youngsters\u2019 art attempts. The bathroom door had scratches and the frame was busted around the door. There were stains on the curtains in the kids room. There were engravings on the bunk bed. The floor in the room was slanted in the middle. Therefore, the door that separated the rooms did not reach the ground. The chest of drawers in the kids room with the flat screen tv on top was tilting because of the floor slant. It looked unsafe for the toddler. Stay away from room 401 due to these reasons.

That part was fine, but the balcony was off of that room. What poor planning on someone's part. My husband and I would want to sit on the balcony after putting the kids to bed but would have to wait till we knew they were asleep before sneaking through the room. The TV in the kids room didn't work properly. The bathtub faucet shot off the wall when my husband was in the shower. All these issues were dealt with promptly and courteously. This hotel was more than $200/night during off season. I did not think it was worth the money at this time of year much less during peak season. I would have preferred spending a little more to upgrade the accomodations. It is situated right off the freeway, I should have guessed the traffic noise would be loud but didn't think of this. All hours of day or night there was traffic noise. However, it was conveniently located to downtown, Old Town, Seaport Village, Sea World and the Zoo. Took minutes to get anywhere. There was just a kind of \"cheap\" vibe to the rooms. Nothing really in disaray yet nothing completely perfect. I felt a muggy, dirty quality. The pool was heated and nice and clean pool area. When checking in, we reciceved a \"goody\" bag with popcorn, cookies, candies and free pay per view movie and a coupon for a free pizza and Coke from the hotel restaraunt. We were told we could use this coupon \"in the restaraunt\" but when we went to use it, they gave us a hassle saying it was only for \"takeout\". They ended up giving it to us to eat there but not after debating the issue, The pizza was more like glorified frozen pizza than anything else. The restaraunt was tiny, extremely overpriced, the food was mediocre and we never ate there for the rest of our stay. The staff was very friendly, knowledgable and helpful.

Very modern and nice. (It is right off the freeway - we asked for a room at the back and we were accomodated. Our room was quiet - no complaints at all.) The room was quite clean; however, see below for one note about that. The pool area was very clean and the pool was heated. The room had a door between our room and the office/livingroom space so we could put our son to bed and still watch tv in our room. It was nice that he could be to sleep at a normal time and we could stay up later. Due to the length of our stay, the hotel waived our $16 a night parking fee. (My husband requested it prior to booking the room. They did try to charge us for it at check out, but it was an oversight - as soon as we told them that there was a note on our file that our fee was to be waived, they took it off and didn't charge us and were apologetic. They seemed genuine.) The staff were friendly. We found the bed very comfy - we like beds on the firmer side. The pillows are fluffy, but we would've liked them to be longer. At least there were plenty of them and we quickly got more pillows and blankets when we called the desk. (See note in the cons re: more...) The cons: Not too impressed with the sofa bed. The cushion on the couch had a broken zipper and the stuffing was falling out the back. The mattress on it was terrible - not good for an adult at all. As previously noted, in another person's review, we also smelled cigarette smoke during our stay. Only for one night but the smell was very bad. I did observe the cleaning staff cleaning our glasses in the bathroom sink. We used paper cups after that. In our opinion, they should be put through a dishwasher and sanitization process. Not the hotel's fault necessarily, but there were several sports teams staying for the weekend. We obviously had no access to the pool area during their stay. As well, the kids were playing some form of ball in the walk way to the door - not very safe for people trying to get by. Perhaps the hotel staff could try to curb the ball games, at the very least? The cushions on the patio furniture near the fire pit area at the pool need replacing. Some are torn and very worn. They are not up to the standard of the hotel. Some of the spare blankets we received were VERY worn, even with holes. They need to check them before providing to guests. Our biggest disappointment was that we read on their website that laundry facilities were onsite so we packed light. There were not facilities onsite - major disappointment when we were there for 8 nights. We were told we could perhaps go to a sister hotel, but they didn't make arrangements for us, nor could they tell us if we could use their pool or anything while we waited for the laundry to be done. Ultimately, we had to make our own arrangements. There is no microwave and the fridge was quite small. Overall, though we found many pluses to the hotel, we most likely won't stay again due to the smoking, lack of laundry facilities and their cleaning of glasses in our bathroom.", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport News, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely nice Hotel with superb rooms\u201d", "Author": "Chemicalx81", "ReviewID": "UR97816251", "Content": "The Hotel is within 15mins from the Airport and in a nice spot.

I can not wait to read the management response to this. Let me guess\u2026 \u201cWe are sorry you were inconvenienced.\u201d I can\u2019t expect anything else, more about that later. After checking in, driving up the steep hill and navigating the tight $16/night parking garage we hauled our luggage through the garage, down the sidewalk, down the ramp, past the pool and pulled the doors open to actually get inside. Please tell me why the doors to & from the walkway to the parking garage are not automatic at all? I'd even go for the push button for handicap accessibility on one of the doors or something. It would also help if there were luggage carts in the garage, or bell staff that could help with bags or get the door. So we get up to our room and my husband instantly clicks the TV on to catch some March Madness basketball. I look around and start to notice that the room is not clean. It was strange because the bed was made, dirty towels were gone, BUT towels weren't replaced, trash cans were full, there was gunk on the sheets..... What the?! My husband picked up the phone to call the front desk and is asked to hold. No big deal, I just want a new room. 10 minutes later the front desk person picks up and asks if he'll hold again, he said NO! He tells the girl what the problem is and she says that we can come down to get a new room. What's confusing me at this point is why the dirty towels were removed & the bed made, but trash wasn't taken out and towels weren't replaced. I know most hotels don't change the sheets daily, but I've never had the trash not emptied when housekeeping comes in to make the bed & tidy up. We wait at the front desk again. Finally get to the front of the line, pass the keys over while my husband says \"I'm the one that called about the dirty room.\" The response? \"Oh, OK,\" that's it. No \u201cI'm sorry about that.\u201d No \u201cSorry we weren't aware that housekeeping hadn't serviced that room.\u201d Nothing, just new room # & recoded keys. Our new room was better. Still not super clean but it had been cleaned. The bathroom was your average sized hotel bathroom, nothing thrilling but fine. The beds were the typical DT beds, nice sheets, comfy mattress. Large flat screen TV. In the cabinet under the TV is a mini fridge which was really nice for leftovers, a big plus. The desk area was fine. The couch was comfy. The sliding door lock didn\u2019t work, but on the 3rd floor I wasn\u2019t too concerned since the slide in L shaped metal \u201clock\u201d was there. Our little rounded balcony looked out over the pool area. Rather The thing was that every night we\u2019d hear all of the kids & families outside in the pool until it closed. Then for some reason after the pool was closed the area around the pool became some sort of hook-up central. There were adults with clothing coming off at least two nights during our stay. Personally, I don\u2019t care if someone was just taking off a jacket, if the pool is closed no one needs to be in that area sharing one lounge chair even cuddling. Go inside and get (into) a (your) room! The drain in our tub was so slow the tub would fill up during one shower. I\u2019m not fond of sitting around in the room in the morning for my husband or I to wait for the tub to drain after the other has showered. It was very par for the course when housekeeping left the hair & soap gunk in the bottom of the tub after they \u201ccleaned\u201d after our first night. I\u2019m sure the housekeeping person just didn\u2019t care that the tub wasn\u2019t draining; it has to be the guests\u2019 job to keep track of those things. So we stopped by the front desk the second morning to let them know that someone had to resolve the tub issue and that the light right inside of our door (the one that is controlled by the switch when you enter the room) had burnt out. I can\u2019t say that I was surprised that a bellman was manning the front desk. It of course took him a while to find something to write our request on. I was actually amazed that they did fix the tub issue and eventually the light too! I know it\u2019s not totally within the hotel\u2019s control, but the people across the hall from us were super loud and obnoxious. The walls in this place are way too thin. From what I saw there were 3 adults and at least 4 kids in that room. Every morning after about 7am they would flip the security latch out so that they could go in & out continuously. That bouncing sound is super when you\u2019re trying to sleep. I\u2019ll also mention the ridiculous rent a cops that just sit & watch TV in the lobby. Glad I can help pay for that too. I would say based on my issues and other reviews those guys probably help get rid of unhappy guests or something. Well, in the past when I\u2019ve had less than stellar hotel stays I have tried not to air all of the details online, I attempt to deal with the hotel first. Since the staff that was on duty through our stay was apathetic at best, that didn\u2019t go anywhere. Only the last day when we were checking out did we see a name for the manager on duty or any sign of the manager. But she was too busy frustrating another guest for us to bother talking to her. I did contact the hotel by submitting a complaint through Hilton\u2019s website. I was contacted by the Front Office Manager (I\u2019m not sure I can post names on here). I went as far as to send this woman photos and point out that my biggest issue with the whole situation is the lack of an apology from the hotel staff when the problems occurred. I have the past been assigned a room that wasn\u2019t cleaned, and the staff has kindly relocated me and apologized. To me, that\u2019s a job well done. Mistakes happen, the front desk might be told by the cleaning staff that a room has been cleaned; they can only go by what they\u2019re told. Unfortunately, the response from the manager was that she was going to have half of my stay refunded, and then said \u201cOnce again I am terribly sorry for the trouble this has caused you.\u201d That\u2019s it. I proceeded to respond, and copy the person from Hilton that forwarded my inquiry to the Doubletree Club. Without actually telling her what to say, I went through a whole email explaining that hotels that can apologize when a problem pops up make me as a guest happy. Sure I\u2019m not ecstatic because the problem still happened, but a simple \u201cI am sorry, your room was not acceptable, we will discuss it with our staff\u201d is very sufficient for me. Well, once again, no actual apology, just this: \u201cWhen I said I was sorry for the trouble, I meant that I was sorry for the inconvenience that we caused you. This situation was discussed with management as well as our team members and it was in no way ignored. Corrective feedback was given to the team members who did not do their job properly.\u201d Look, I don\u2019t want to know what was done to whom. I don\u2019t care what was discussed with whom. I want the hotel management to acknowledge a problem and give an apology. I didn\u2019t want a refund. Why should the company I booked through have to go through the hassle of a refund. Never did I say I was \u201ctroubled\u201d or inconvenienced, as I said the indifferent staff was my problem and it should be a problem for this hotel. After my email the manager called my home but I was at work. My husband did give her my cell phone number but I couldn\u2019t pick up. After two calls in a row from the hotel I had one long silence voicemail and one that said \u201cHello Ms \u2018my last name\u2019 this is\u201d. That\u2019s it. No way will I call you back if you can\u2019t actually leave me a message or try back later if you can\u2019t figure out how Sprint\u2019s voicemail works. Ultimately, I gave up on the series of emails. I wasn\u2019t getting anywhere by emailing the hotel directly. Apparently \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d was not in the manager\u2019s vocabulary. This place really has potential. The parking situation is bad. The driveway down onto Hotel Circle is steep and you can scrape your car. BUT, had this hotel lived up to the standards one would expect with the Doubletree name those things would have been minor details. The location in hotel circle is great. Easy access of course to the 8 & the 5, but not too bad to head up toward North County either, and really convenient to Old Town. Now they are just problems on a long list of things, most of which could be fixed by this joke of a hotel.

The hotel room was very nice and we had so much fun in San Diego. We also visited their pool which was lovely as well and I think there was only 2 other people in it at the time. The best thing about the Doubletree is the cookies! I went up to front desk 3 times and asked for cookies and every time they gave me one with a smile on their face. So delicious. Now on to the bad. We live in Los Angeles so, San Diego is about a 2 hour drive without traffic. I called the night before and spoke with a nice man in reservations about the possibility of an early check in. He told me that they had 4 family suites available that evening so checking in early the next day should be no issue at all. He advised that I call the next morning but I failed to do that. The next day we left for San Diego and arrived at the hotel around 12:00 PM. When we went to check in they said that the room was unavailable and told housekeeping to put a \"rush\" on the room. It basically means that housekeeping skips the other rooms and goes to ours ASAP because we're there waiting. The guy at front desk told us it would be about an hour. Which, was totally fine! We went to the beach and came back 1 hour and 20 minutes later and the same guy said it would be ready in about 10 minutes. We were a little irritated but still ok. He told us to stay in the lobby and he would let us know as soon as it's ready. Thirty minutes later my Husband goes back up to the same man and says \"how is our room looking\"? and the man looks at me and my Husband as if he has no idea who we are. Please keep in mind that there are NO other guests checking in and this guy told us to wait in the lobby so that he could tell US when the room was ready. It was the strangest thing! Then when my Husband reminds him and he says \"oh your room is ready\" as if he knew all along. I have an 18 month old little boy that was running around the lobby out of boredom for 30 minutes for no reason at all! We were in his line of sight the whole time and he somehow forgot about us. My biggest advice if you stay at this hotel is don't plan on getting an early check-in. Actually, don't even plan on checking in on time because more than likely it won't happen. After that everything was fine. We only stayed one night though. I saw a lot of people complaining about the parking - which is now $16.00. The parking lot is on a steep hilll so when you leave go very slow. The hotel did ask me if I'd be parking there and I was warned about the charge in advance. I read someone said that there was ample parking on the street but I didn't really see that and it's a busy road on hotel circle so, you really don't want to park there. Another thing that I'm just remembering. All of the Family Suites on the 5th floor are next to elevators. There is no escaping it! I actually didn't mind it but you could hear it throughout the night. Also, I kept hearing the people next door to us and they kept waking us up. The walls seem to be pretty thin - not much they can do about that I guess though. I also wanted to add that I love how the Manager of this hotel responds to every review and raves about the positives but kind of dismisses the negatives.

At 9 am, we discovered the cause of the fire alarm - the water boiler had blown a circuit ... so no hot water. When I called, the hotel apologized and siad they would remove the $14 charge for parking. We were told that the part would be replaced within 30 minutes, so we went to breakfast. On the way to breakfast, we noticed that pool was closed and yellow tape had appeared around it. The pool had been in use the night before. We were told that the pool was under repair and would be closed for a week. Oh? Nothing was said at check-in. The hotel gave us one night free. The buffet breakfast is $12.95 per person, but free for higher level Hilton HHonors members. Not a good deal at $12.95, but very good when it is free.

Based on previous reports and the overall rating, I was hesitant to book a stay. However, if you know some of the peculiarities, they can be mitigated. The propert exceeds the Hilton standards (Doubletree warm cookies are always great!). Others have mentioned the friendliness of the staff - I second it. Parking is definitely tight! It seems as if the parking garage was made to perfectly \"fit\" a compact car. Driving up and down the ramp, it seemed that the garage was a life sized version of a Lego garage - not much room for errors (you can see scuff marks and dings through out the garage.) If driving a full sized truck/SUV or even a car, be careful driving up and down the garage and when parking. Rooms are a bit small, but comfortable - beds and pillows very COMFORTABLE. An unusual, but nice amenity is a small (very small, not even able to put a chair) balcony. Highway noise is noticeable, but not too bad. As countless others will tell you, three words are important in property management (as well as realty), \"location, location, location.\" The property is centrally located in a convenient location. Important points: * Gym - okay, a bit small, but workable. PRECOR cardio equipment (2x treadmills, 1x elliptical, 1x recumbant bike), dumbells, one flat bench that can be inclined up, big ball, and two kettleballs. If you want to be able to watch and more importantly listen to the built in television, BRING YOUR OWN EAR PHONES. * Bar - has Chimay Brew (Belgian Trappist bier on tap!) Outstanding - two others, but why imbide when you have Chimay? * Restaurant/Bar - one and the same - also where you enjoy the breakfast. The front area is a bit on the small side. Depending on what time you go to breakfast, it may be busy. I stayed in the hotel during a Realtor Seminar was occurring on site, so it was a bit busy during 0730-0900.

Parking is tight, and the ramps can be difficult to navigate if you have a large vehicle. Ramp parking is limited to vehicles less than 6 feet high. Spaces are smallish. It is a shame to charge $14 bucks for this lot, especially since they allow people who utilize the hotel for meeting space free access.

We ended up choosing Hotel Circle because we wanted to be on the outskirts of the city with easy access - big mistake. In most US cities the hotel area situated close to a major highway is set away from the highway with a selection of chain hotels and eateries all easily accessible. Hotel Circle isn't like that - it is set parallel to the highway, some hotels have quite a good sized plot but others are squeezed into a space which really isn't big enough. This hotel was one of those in too tight a spot. The reviews for this hotel were very mixed with only 50% of people being satisfied. It didn't help that some reviews for Doubletree Mission Valley had been posted on this site so references to walking to the Hazzard Centre, free parking outside the hotel and special floors for Hilton Honors cardholders did not apply. First impressions of the hotel are the very steep incline from the highway to the front of the hotel - quite scary and very easy to scrape the underside of your car going up. The parking is every bit as bad as everyone described and then they have the cheek to charge for it!!! Our room wasn't ready and we were told to come back in 2 hours - not what you want to hear after a 200 mile drive. The problem was there was nowhere to go, nothing within walking distance, no outside space except the noisy pool area and a very unwelcoming noisy reception area. When we did get into our room we were pleased, it was quite a decent size, very light and airy and it was nice to have a couch and the balcony. What we didn't like was the lack of toiletries and coffee. The hotel makes a great fuss over the selection of Neutrogena toiletries they give you. Well, all we had was one shampoo, one conditioner and one body lotion for 2 of us to last for a 3 night stay. Also we only had one coffee sachet and one creamer each per day. I know that in this economic climate economies have to be made but when I'm paying the going rate for a full service hotel I don't expect to have to economise on their behalf. The manager will probably say we could have asked for more, but we shouldn't have to ask. The restaurant was just okay and there was nowhere else to eat close by that didn't need transport. The final straw was on our second day when workmen took over our floor, the noise and the toxic fumes were terrible but we had no warning about this nor an apology when we complained. In summary this is not a 'full service' hotel, we've had better for half the price in a chain motel.

They said \"No Problem\" and told me that a room on the 7th floor overlooking the pool would be ready for me upon our arrival. We arrive at about 4 pm to wait in line for about 20 mins. due to the fact that the young lady was alone behind the counter. I noticed that she wasn\u2019t being the regular NICE type of person that are typically at Doubletree or any Hilton property. Well when we finally got to her I gave her my information when she tells me my room is still dirty and that it would be about an hour before it would be ready. After being at the beach all day I was ready to take anything. She said there would be a $14 for parking I made the comment that it should be free since my room wasn\u2019t ready, keep in mind never a smile, apology or anything of the sort. I asked for a manager and she responded that there wasn\u2019t one at the property till the next day. I asked who was in charge, she said ME! I can go on and on, but I think you get an idea of what I\u2019m talking about here. There is a reason I stay at Hilton properties, this isnt it.NO way its not a 3 star, and I would never stay here again. Be careful if you choose a 3 star in the Mission Valley are of San Diego on priceline, you might get stuck here. Oh and by the way she didnt even give us the DOUBLETREE COOKIES!!!!

I am sorry I am writing a long review (as I hate it when people do) but I strongly feel I have to tell the whole story, cause it is nothing less than shocking! So here it is: We decided to go to San Diego to take our daughter to Sea World. The double tree hotel was close to Sea World and they had junior suites which was exactly what we were looking for as we wanted to put our daughter down in the bedroom and be able to hang out and watch TV for a couple of hours in the other room. We paid for a junior suite though Expedia. I called the hotel the afternoon of our arrival and asked for them to put a crib in our room so that we can put our daughter down as soon as we got there. We were told over the phone that there is no need and that they can bring the crib up in 10 minutes when we get there. After a long day at Sea World with our 2 year old, we got to the hotel at 10 pm. There was no bell boy, no one to greet us at the hotel, and no one to even guide us in the right direction. My husband went in and was told he would have to park the car and just come in. We self parked and unpacked the car. Once we got in, we were told by the rude check in person, Jennifer Aparicio, that they did not have our room and that they over booked and we have to go to a different hotel! She said they will give us a refund and will not charge us at the other hotel. We asked her if we are going to get a comparable room at the other hotel and she said NO, you are JUST going to get a regular room! At this point I was started to get frustrated and upset at her level of condescension and non-sympathy\u2026 after all, we were there with an extremely tired 2-year old. The least we expected after our PAID FOR room was given away, was an apologetic reception. We did not only get that, we got an overbearing, condescending and rude Jennifer. I said: what do you mean? where is the manager?\" and she told us there is no manager and she is the ONLY person there. We insisted we get a room similar to the one we had booked and she told us \"you are getting a free room out of this, what are you complaning about?\" We were so shocked! not once did she say \"I am so sorry for the inconviniance, I understand, I will try my best to accomodate you\" But the story doesn\u2019t end there. She then started helping other customers, while we are standing there to the side. I had to leave to take our 2-year old to the bathroom, and I turned around to tell my husband to make sure that we are taken care of. Jennifer loudly demanded that I \u201cCALM DOWN\u201d. At this point my husband lost his temper, but not his control. He proclaimed that he believed he may be in a twilight zone episode, and that he has never met anyone so rude, in all of his years of travel. And now the story gets even better. Jennifer, called for the security guard David Veja, and told him to escort us out of the hotel. This was becoming too much. I still can not believe my husband didn\u2019t resort to violence or profanity. The security guard then said \u201cI have to escort you out\u201d, to which my husband's reply was \u201cplease try\u201d. Meanwhile, there are dozens of people at the hotel lobby watching this whole thing. And mind you, this is all happening in front of our 2 year old! The security guard then told us \"you are getting a free room, stop whinig, this is my final offer, take it or leave it!!!!\" to which my husband replied \"who are you to give us an offer? you are a security guard here!\" So we left and went to another hotel, exhausted and SHOCKED!!! I think, the worst Motel would have more qualified and professional people working there. This hotel shoud have 0 stars at best! It is now 10 days past our travel date and I just called Expedia to file a complaint just to find out they have not even called Expedia for the refund!

So I have a good pool to compare from. We booked ours through Get Away Today Vacations. (highly recommend it too) I was a bit worried reading the reviews. But to our wonderful surprise our room was brand new! Check in was seamless thanks to GATV. At the front desk they told us that there was a $7 a day parking charge...which I expected $14 from reading the reviews. However I reminded them that I booked with GATV and the lady gave us a free parking pass. Upon entering the lobby was above average for Hotel Circle. Nice, clean and modern. We were assigned a room on the third floor. (This is an 8 story building and from what I understand only levels 8 and 3 were open. The rest were still under construction.) We didnt notice the construction too much. Our room was pretty quite 99% of the time. However we didn't sleep in past 8am and we were gone most of the time between 10am till around 4pm. One guest that we talked to said her room was a very noisy during the day when she tried to put her daughter down for a nap. She too wish that they would of disclosed the construction when booking. Room was clean, we had a suite that slept 2 adults and 4 kids 13 yrs and under. The beds and pillows and linens were THE BEST! EXTREMELY Comfortable and clean. The carpet was new which is always a plus in any hotel. Missing the mini fridge they use to have. Flat screen tv, wireless keyboard for internet access if you don't have a laptop. Video game controllers. Bathroom needed better lights. Hard to really tell how your makeup looks. Better venation for moisture would be recommended too, but don't know many hotels that don't have that problem. Water pressure was a bit weak but the shower heads were great enough to compensate. All the \"bath samples\" items were Neutrogena not some no-name brand. Came with a full size blow dryer and LOTS of towels! The pool and jacuzzi was clean and comfortably heated with a plentiful supply of pool towels. Housekeeping was very good. They were very very quiet when in the halls unlike some places Ive been to. Check out was seamless again. Just turned in keys and that was it. Do becareful when entering and exiting their STEEP drive way. We saw a Corvette bottom out just creeping down.
