We recommend the hotel consider a non-smoking policy at the pool. We dined at the B-Line and Napa. The B-Line is a diner style restaurant which is a nice change of pace for a hotel of this caliber. Open 24 hours and really good food. Breakfast staff amazing. Lunch and evening staff a little slow. Napa was great. Had a fantastic server, Nathan and the menu items can be a bit quirky but the food tastes great. Our daughter got to be the Honorary Duck Master of the day! Donald the Duck Master is amazing with kids. Highly recommend asking the concierge if you have small children if there is an opportunity for them to be Duck Master for the day!

Hence, I started to pile wet towels together in the sink before we left so they would pick them up and give us new ones after our second day of our trip . They will do your beds and do the turn down and leave a nice thoughtful note w/ choc if you are on the concierge level and lay out the robe for u (caution we only had one mmmmmm). Though as far as a thorough cleaning and dusting seems to be held off to protect the environment. Its not a big deal but if your not into keeping things green and more like keeping things clean this can get on your nerves. About Concierge Level Floor 25 and up Wonderful staff+++++ Can't say enough about them they are so helpful and kind- We gave them tips much deserved Great Views of Orlando Fireworks++++ Great Place to unwind after a long day at the parks with some desserts served between 8- 10:30pm choc cookies/ pastries/ chocolates with a variety of drinks and or wines/ liquor (though the alcohol is extra). Also around 5:30-7:00 they give u hors d'oeuvres which included prosciutto, ham, salami, etc, different cheeses, breads along with two specialty item for the day with all the drinks and or liquors (alcohol is extra). Bad: Concierge level Breakfast Morning continental breakfast at the lounge was ok. M-F they only serve it from 7-9am which was crazy and cheap. Guess a way for them to save on some money at the Peabody. Saturday and Sunday the hours are extended 10am . The breakfast can be better not much to chose from not sure if it was because they were so crowded due to the plastic convention or what but slim pickings . Though again the girls in the lounge worked diligently, were kind and always aiming to please so by no means nothing they did or could do though they tried to get whatever they could from the back to please everyone. Another Negative about the concierge level our keys to our rooms and or to elevator never seemed to work one or the other always so we always had to go to reception to get this adjusted. Nightmare!!!!! Its a big hotel so a lot of walking. Food Room service is the worst you'll ever have.Don't waste your money this coming from an 11 yr old who does not have a very distinctive palate. Not to mention how ripped off you get for pasta, coke and some cookies $60+tip. I recommend it better to go downstairs and eat at there Beline Diner. The deserts at the Beline Diner are amazing. So if u have a sweet tooth the Beline Diner is the place to go and there breakfast is pretty good too. Open late and good prices. Rock lounge has very loud music and has something going on every night though they do not have babysitting here and this place does not allow anyone younger than 18. Also be aware if traveling with little ones and coming through lobby doors with sleepy little ones this would definitely wake them up. Music starts rocking at 8:00pm and stops around 1:00 am . We did not dine at there Napa Rest for break, lunch or dinner. They also have an early breakfast buffet here every morning which we seemed to miss. Also there menu was a little to distinctive for our 11 yr old. Though one great component of this hotel by far is the Capriccio Grill not to mention if u are ever in the vicinity here for Easter please book there Easter brunch it is amazing and a must do!!!!! The best food and best time . The decor was beautiful, the service is impeccable, the bunnies are adorable not to mention the ducks in the middle of the fountain truly a distinctive touch. JUST WISH THEY RAN THE HOTEL THIS WAY!!!! Pool Was nice with its slides and kids little splash area and its pretty big. Though I've seen better. Also while we were there it was very busy so u could not find sitting and it seemed people reserved early morn by placing a white towel. Also I found it messy. Everyone left there dirty towels on chairs, drinks and plastic containers flying everywhere not to mention food. Did not give it the ambiance one is looking for that for sure mostly not for a 5 star certainly can find someone to go around and clean things up. Beware of this hotels room chrges. This hotel can go chrg crazy so check your bill. I would recommend not to chrg anything to your room . They become chrg happy here ours was 689 which we can't figure how they got this figure. Our cards have a fraud alert on them hence put a hold on the account until we noticed it and called our credit card. This can be pretty scary stuff when u are on vac. Not to mention all the time and aggravation spent on all this to get attitudes and denials from mgmt repeatedly. . We finally paid with another card closed out bill and started fresh making sure nothing else was chrged. Thus to make a long story short when we got home it took another two more weeks out of our lives to get this off our card and to reaffirm it was them. Not to mention all the time and aggravation. To be honest if it weren't for the girls up in the concierge lounge, spa (which my daughter and I enjoye mani n pedi, hair, massage, and facial they were wonderful and so was the staff there too) the ducks ,Donald the duck master and Easter brunch I would of given this hotel an F. Though the ducks are a beautiful touch along with Donald there duck master and it is what makes this hotel distinctive. Though if u have children I would recommend the Hyatt or the Ritz Carlton.", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverview, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Room, Great Pool!!\u201d", "Author": "Tinkerbell1391", "ReviewID": "UR128623155", "Content": "This was a family trip. We decided last minute to hop in the car and take a ride to Orlando for a couple of days. We got a last minute deal so the hotel price was amazing for The Peabody. We have been to the Memphis Hotel but never actually stayed in the hotel. When we arrived it was a little confusing on where the entrance to the hotel and main lobby was but a hotel employee noticed we were lost and showed us our way! Check in was quick and easy. The Bell Hop helped with our bags and the Valet guys helped with the car parking. You can do self parking but apparently it is a long walk . . . long enough that they have a shuttle (long golf cart) to take you to and from the hotel. We chose Valet but it was $20 a day!!!! A Little pricey if you ask me but its The Peabody so I guess it is what it is. When we arrived in our room it was perfect. The room was spacious and clean with big Queen beds :) The bathroom was nice especially with the TV in the Bathroom Mirror! We quickly changed in to our swim suits and headed to the pool for some relaxation. The pool was amazing. There were two. We chose the one with the huge waterfall, bar, kids pool, slide and gigantic pool! Our son absolutely LOVED the pool. It is a beach like set up where you can just walk in, no stairs so that was super nice. The pool bar was also pretty good. We had an appetizer and some Adult beverages :) The next morning we got up and my husband was completely lost . . . there was NO COFFEE POT in the room!!!! I dont think that I have ever been to a hotel without an in room coffee pot! So once we were all dressed we headed to the \"coffee bar\" place in the middle of the hotel. Of course, EVERYONE was there because they wanted their Mojo! There were only 2 girls working and it TOOK FOREVER! People were ordering breakfasts and frappiccino's. . . .it was forever. We skipped this the next morning due to the insane wait time. The shops in the hotel were reasonable on somethings and insane for others. Everything in the Peabody is duck related. Even the ash trays in the waiting area of the Valet has duck prints. The March of Ducks we did the second morning and it was cool. The ducks have to walk much further than the Ducks in Memphis! These ducks RUN too, so if you want to get a picture make sure you have a camera that doesn't pause or take its time to take because you will miss it!

It is extremely convenient for that! We like the physical hotel and the accommodations. In many ways, it is definitely high end, but there are a few things that make it not feel high-end, and thus, not worth the room rate. One of our party did not have a shower curtain in his room when he checked in. That was fixed in a reasonable amount of time. On our first full day, the maid did not clean our room. We called at 5pm, just before dinner, and let them know. The hotel employee asked if we still wanted the room cleaned, and we of course did. They did come to clean after that. The check-in experience, as well as any visit to the front desk feels a lot like the corrals in the lobby of Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. The wait is entirely too long for anything, and it seems there are never enough people working behind huge front desk. We stopped in the lounge after dinner on our last night to meet some business associates for drinks. It took at least 15 minutes to get our first round. It took so long that we decided to forego a second round and packed it in for the night. Our dinner experience at Napa was pretty good, but also pricey for the experience.

I'd actually never even heard of this hotel but booked it because of the steep discount provided through Expedia that weekend and beacause of the reviews. The Peabody is in an excellent location, close to International Drive and a convention center. It's also not too far from outlet shopping which is popular in Orlando. Everything was modern and well kept even though we were in the \"older\" tower. Self parking is pricey at $17 per day but it goes with the territory I suppose. There is also a $10 daily resort fee. The duck parade is a cute idea, but was hard to even see since everyone bum rushes the red carpet and fountain area. I didn't try out the pool since it was rainy the weekend I stayed, but it looked fantastic. One negative was that I wished the self parking was a little more accessible to the hotel but there is an attendant on a golf cart who will pick you up if necessary. Another con: service was fine except the morning we were checking out room service tried to enter our room around 7am! She then asked when we would be leaving (check out is not until noon), which I thought was rude. We also had a slightly rude cashier while we tried to purchase our coffee; she just handed me the receipt and didn't so much as glance my way or utter a word when I told her thank you. She was already servicing the next person before I even took the receipt from her hand. Nothing drastic, but still hospitality is hospitality - especially when you claim to be a 4+ star hotel. Lastly, the bathroom door was awkward to close because the plush mat kept jamming it and there's no room to move it. All in all, the rooms were clean and spacious. The beds were VERY comfortable with great linens and pillows. The tub was nice to soak in and TV in the bathroom mirror is kind of cool. I even loved the complimentary robes which I normally think feel rough and unpleasant. I'd stay again for the highly discounted price I paid, but not for it's retail cost mainly due to service (some of the service staff was amazing, while others were disappointing).

First of all this hotel is now totally different with the extra tower. When we stayed last time it was a wonderful, calm and sophisticated hotel with more of an adult atmosphere than most of the Orlando hotels and with great service. The hotel is still gorgeous but its now just like another family resort as they have added a large pool complete with water slides etc. We missed the old Peabody! Rooms were gorgeous, we were in the new tower and the room obviously had expensive furniture, lighting etc. My daughter was impressed with the TV built into the bathroom mirror! No complaints there at all. Only issue was the lack of a coffee machine, they had free coffee in the lobby but it was miles away and only available 5.30 to 8.30 in the morning - we missed it everday! Surely it wouldnt hurt to put a machine in the room??? We didnt eat at the restaurants or the bars as the prices were really expensive and lacking in atmosphere, better ones 5 mins walk away. We spend a lot of time at the pool and used the old Terrace pool as it was much quieter. They obviously aren't too interested in it even though a manager wonders about doing nothing, there was all sorts of stuff left there from the day before, there were old towels hanging about for days and often none available in the mornings. The first day we asked the concierge if anyone could bring towels but were told to take them from our room - obviously thats not correct so we went to the newer pool to pick some up and they had hundreds! Also the bar at The Terrace doesn,t open till 5pm - not much use if you're after drinks and food during the day. Maids weren't happy when we asked them to clean our room a little earlier one day but they did do a great job and left the room spotless with loads of towels etc. Car parking was expensive, self parking was $17 plus tax per day and the car park was a 5 min walk away. As we didnt intend to use our car much we parking at Pointe Orlando which is another 5 mins further walk but only cost $6 per day - we saved loads doing that.

I was there for a conference, not vacation, so keep that in mind. My nits: there was no in-room coffee. I just hate having to deal with room service when I wake, and worse is having to drag on clothes to go downstairs to buy it. Second, there are lots of little lights in the room that cannot be turned off (like the clock and faint backlights on the LED reading lamps). Light sleepers like me have to unplug things. The pillows were all feather type, and compressed to the point that they offered little support (I sleep on my side). Something in the shampoo stung my eyes so severely that I starting using soap to wash my hair. The shower head was difficult to move into a good position. There is a mandatory resort fee that covers fitness and internet access, so why not just include that in the room rate? On the plus side, there are nice touches. The bathroom mirror has a built in TV (tower 2 only, I think), and motion activated night lights that are quick to shut off and very effective. The curtains seal out light effectively, and there are plenty of lamps and plugs. The rooms are large and have enough storage even for long stays. The Internet is the fastest that I have experienced in any hotel. The primary restaurant is good, but costly. However, the location on International Drive is convenient to many, many alternatives.

The entire hotel is beautifully designed, but a few amenities are really worth note: The fitness center is an actual fitness center! It has more machines and weight equipment than most health clubs. A great change from the usual hotel \"fitness center\" which is two treadmills and a blaring television. The pool! Wow. There is a main pool area that is very kid and family friendly, with zero-depth entry and waterfalls, etc. It's welcoming and fun but also sophisticated somehow and not to disney-fied like many Orlando places. Then, there's a separate lap pool on another level that is more adult and fitness centered, and it is incredible. I swam a mile there in the lap pool and it was the best time of my entire business trip. The restaurants (Napa and something like Capriccio) were perfect. Convenient, quality food, great atmosphere.

My husband and I wanted to get away for a few days with our 14 month old son. We booked 2 adjoining rooms (because our son is a very light sleeper.) One room smelled like cigarette smoke, but only after the first day. It was very odd -- I didn't notice the odor when we first checked-in. It was only after the first morning (and each day after that) that I noticed the smell. Usually I would ask for another room, but we had already un-packed everything, and we didn't spend much time in the room anyway, so we left it. Anyway, the hotel itself is nice and well laid out. We were in the new tower. All guest rooms come with coolers -- not refridgerators, it turns out. It never got very cold, so I called down to the front desk to ask about the settings for the fridge, and was quickly corrected that it was a cooler, not a fridge, so it will not be as cold as a fridge. (Even though the slogan on the cooler door reads: Feed the Fridge.) The pool area is great, although they don't have umbrellas. (At least not in March.) I can't imagine hanging out by the pool in the summer without some relief of shade, but they do have cabanas you can rent. Pool bar is over-priced, as all pool-bars are. Service from waiters in the pool area is spotty. This is a large convention hotel, but we did see a lot of other families traveling with kids of all ages. Self parking is $16, plus tax. Be sure to tell the front desk at check in if you want to self park -- they have to activate your room key so you get in/out priviledges. We didn't eat onsite, so can't comment on the food, but they do have lots of choices. Pointe Orlando is an entertainment complex next door, and is walkable, but The Peabody is a large property, so it is a bit of a walk. Definitely doable, but not just a \"block\" away. (Think \"walkable\" in Vegas, only not that spread-out.) Lots of dining options there, but everything on or around I-Drive is a chain restaurant, so manage expectations. Ale House has a great, big Cobb salad for a reasonable price (not in Pointe Orlando, but just up I Drive a bit.) IHOP and Dennys are on I-Drive for a nice, cheap breakfast. (Don't go to the IHOP attached to the Days Inn Hotel on I-Drive. It's tiny and has bad service.) Overall the Peabody is perfectly situated on I-Drive, a short drive to all the attractions.

I'll start with the good things - the property itself is GORGEOUS. The hotel is beautiful, well-decorated and feels incredibly luxurious from the moment you walk in. The rooms are great, ours was a little on the small side (my mom was staying in the room next door and hers was SIGNIFICANTLY larger even though we paid the same price for the rooms.) The bed is super comfortable, the bathroom is perfect (loved the TV in the bathroom mirror and the duck soap!) Housekeeping came twice a day and did a wonderful job (although one night they woke us up at 10PM for turn down service, which I thought was a really odd hour to come, especially since they knew we were a family with a small child.) And, of course, the duck march was adorable! We ate in two restaurants (the B-line Diner and the Mallard Bar) and both were great - no complaints there! Now, on to the bad: First, the pool. It is a BEAUTIFUL pool, well designed and we loved the water slide and the kids area but there were a couple of major problems. First, there are only 3 trash cans in the whole GIANT pool area and the staff did a TERRIBLE job bussing tables. Every table around us was full of empty cups, trash and ashtrays EVERY TIME we went to the pool. I never saw a staff member pick up even one dirty cup wile we were there. What a shame! Also, the pool does not get sunny until noon and so it's very chilly and windy there in the morning. Next, the rooms are oddly lacking in basic amenities. There are no microwaves. You can request one for $20 a day (but you can also BUY one for $40) so that seems incredibly wasteful if you are staying there for a week to pay $140 (which we were.) I called the concierge to see if we could borrow one to heat up my son's lunch and the concierge was stumped as to how to help us. They finally said they would send a microwave up to our room for us to heat up his lunch and then take it back, but they never sent one. The shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom are terrible. Most nice hotels have a company sponsor their bathroom products and I am wondering why they don't do the same to get higher quality bath products? There is no coffee or coffee makers in the rooms. They do have a coffee service downstairs from 5:30-8:30 in the Mallard Tower but when my husband went down one morning to find it, the Concierge told him it ended at 7AM and so he came back up empty0handed. If you want to buy coffee, it's $4.50. Seems pricey for something that is generally included at a nice hotel. The concierges we spoke to were all very pleasant but very untrained. Maybe there's a barrage of new staff members or something right now? One concierge I spoke with about Disney discounts told me she couldn't tell me what the Disney discounts were, it was all very secret and varied depending on what conference you were with. The woman at the ticket center in the hotel was VERY helpful and gave us the exact breakdown of ticket costs (it was a standard discount and DID NOT vary.) I called one morning to get advice on finding a local orange grove and was transferred to the concierge and promptly hung up on...THREE TIMES IN A ROW. So I gave up and found the information elsewhere. Also, their wifi is spotty and tends to just bounce you back to the Peabody home page. I actually had to turn it off to get my iphone to work properly. So, overall, I would give this hotel 5 stars for the actual property and 2 stars for the terrible service and lack of amenities. I have stayed at several true five star hotels and this one has a LONG way to go. We stayed at the Hilton Orlando last year and LOVED that one (but it was all booked up this year.)

Arrived around 830pm on a Thursday night and waited in line for 30 minutes before being helped.... they only had 2 girls working the desk, and a third arrived, but with the convention traffic coming in it didn't help much. They were courteous and polite, I was upgraded to a mini-suite at no cost because they had overbooked their king rooms. Okay I thought this is good. They did book me in the tower close to the convention center since I was attending a conference there.. this is a must.. I had colleagues that was in the opposite tower and they were really in for a work out getting to the convention hall. The room was nice, a TV in the bathroom mirror was both creepy and useful!! The bed however was a bed that pulls out of the wall and about 14 inches off the ground, not great for getting up in the morning with stiff hips! Overall the room was clean, fresh, and very nice. The kid pool area is huge and perfect for families. There is a quieter pool on the recreation floor that is almost olympic length and I took advantage of the atmosphere and swam there often. Service there however only starts after 5pm. There is no food or drinks at the rec floor pool during the day. This was disappointing. Getting into any of the nicer restaurants was near impossible.. as they opened at 6pm and closed at 10pm and with the size of the hotel they were booked solid. Another disappointment. The diner was open 24x7 and had good food just slightly overpriced, but when you went there to eat, there was a line going out the door, because of the limited seating capacity.. there was no place else to grab breakfast... unless you count the grab and go which had old looking bagels and coffee... not my idea of breakfast. Service was great in the bar areas, spent 2 nights in the piano bar area, and the food was good and the service exceptional.

Once we got down stairs and spoke to someone we were told to wait a few minutes more because the manager wanted to speak to us.... Well, another 15 and we are still ready to leave the hotel but just as we get up to leave, the manager finally decided to make an appearance. We were told they made a mistake and were sorry for the wrong room so then gave us the right one. Our luggage was then brought up to our new room, which was okay, but not worth the price. We had a nice time that day at the pool but need better service down there because there are not enough chairs and when we did get a place we were stuck with our empty drink glasses and food trays for the rest of the day. Anyways, later that night around 11 pm, we returned back to the room from Howl at the Moon with some friends, who were also staying at the hotel. From then on we had 3 different meets with the \"Security Officer\" who kept saying we were being too \"loud\"! I called down to the desk to speak with a manager but of course no one was available, about 10 minutes later we got a call back from one but did nothing to recitify the situation. Once again I informed then we will be more than happy to check out and never come back because I didnt know it was against the rules to have people in our sitting room that late at night just talking.

The location is superb, you can easily walk out of the hotel to many restaraunts, cinema, mini golf, shopping etc and no matter what time of day or night you always feel completely safe. To any one thinking of booking to go to Florida I would say do it NOW! We certainly will be as soon as we can afford it.

We booked a couple of rooms and the occupany of the other room arrived around 10PM from her flight only to be told there was no room available. After two hours of back and forth and arguing, she finally got a room. That's really unecessary. We waited a long time for the car to be brought around using valet as well... Use the self-park, it's a quick walk from the front door area. Our room was nice, but the bathroom was way too small. We were in the older tower this time and the room was nicely refurbished to make it match the newer rooms, but the bathroom door opens right into the toilet. There is no clearance under the door to allow for the floormat that they have in the bathroom, as it bunches up under the door when you open it. We also had to call to get our room made around 5PM on our first day since it was never made, after we had been out all day. This was a sold out convention that we were there for. Also, we hosted a bar meet & greet in the Mallard bar area and got horrible service from a younger bar tender who wouldn't serve us without having to go through the lady who was serving the area we were standing. The problem with that was she was too busy to keep up with everyone we had and so we went directly to him to get better service for our business guests, only to be told to order through her. It was embarassing to have this transaction occur in front of our clients. We ended up only spending a few hundred dollars in the bar, but would've spent more had we had better service! Anyway...

Probably the biggest hotel I've seen or had the pleasure of staying in. I had an awesome stay here while on vacation with my wife. So here are a few tips that will help all of you who are planning on taking a vacation here. I'm a little bit of a \"cheapo\" and the rooms here are not cheap so here is how I justified it. The hotel gave me free wi-fi which is a $13/day savings. The pool area looks like a water park so that could take a day of vacation in itself free of charge. Pools is complete with spa, jacuzzi's, water fountains and a slide. Walking distance from the hotel are some cheap eats like Denny's, Ihop, McDonalds, Ben & Jerrys and a Walgreens for anything els. The hotel offers free unlimited trolly tickets that will take you to many different places around the area. Sea World is a 4 minute drive, Disney World is a 7 minute drive, and Universal Studios is a 8 minute drive. All three locations are reachable by trolly which was free for Peabody guests! With all of this offered by the hotel, I was able to save a lot of money. Inside the Peabody they have a few bars that are always packed with people having a good time and live music. You know the bar is good when non guests come to a hotel for the bar scene. Restaurants are very good as well but a little pricey. I would recommend eating off site.The Gym is really spacious and clean, which is a big plus in my book. It is separated into 4 different rooms and has a luxury locker room complete with showers. Located next to the convention center ($35 cab from Orlando airport), the Peabody actually has it's own mini convention center. They were holding some sort of conference while we were staying here and there must have been 700-800 people. The meeting rooms here are huge. I was amazed to see how many people were attending the conference, yet the hotel still did not seem crowded due to its massive size and space. Rooms are very nice and have a lot of special features that you don't see very often in hotels. Underneath the nightstands are motion censured lights that work as night lights when it detects motion in the dark. Perfect for those middle of the night runs to the restroom.

As a Meeting Planner, I am pretty picky about hotels, especially when it comes to service. I was never disappointed and actually had a great time! Rooms: I was in a Standard King room and it was really nice. The bathroom was more than enough room for me, and I tend to spread my things out when I'm getting ready. I loved the TV in the mirror - unnecessary, but cool. The bed was super comfy and I had no trouble sleeping. Service: The staff and service was great for the most part. I did have one frustrating experience while ordering food from Napa. I was over at the convention center and wanted to order the fish tacos for lunch. I called over and was transferred to Napa by the hotel Operator. I spoke with the Hostess and told her I wanted to order food to-go. She told me the bartender took to-go orders and transferred my call to the bar. Bartender never answered, but my call was picked up by the kitchen staff, who transferred me back to the bar, but somehow my call was picked up by the IT Dept. (Seriously, no joke.) Eventually I was transferred back to the bartender and he took my order. I went to pick it up without issue, but no one seemed sympathetic to my frustration of getting the run around. Anyways, by the time I got back to the CC with my food, I realized they forgot to add the salsa. Tacos were bland and sub-par. Not worth the hassle. I understand they don't usually do take out, so maybe try it out..? Food and Bev. Outlets: I ate mostly at the B-Line Diner, since it was fast and I was working. I have at least 5 meals there and everything was really tasty. The bar, Rocks, was fun and had live music. I really liked the atmosphere there and it was nice to meet up with friends and colleagues.

Went for business that took place in the adjacent/attached convention center so I'll let others comment on location and proximity to local attractions. The hotel however was quite large - almost Vegas style in dimension and presence. The public areas were very well appointed, contemporarily done, and quite comfortable. My assessments. Lobby/Check-In/Out: A- Very nice, spacious area with marble flooring. The folks at the counter were very helpful, friendly and quick to address your needs. Rooms: B- but might be an B+/A- if I were in a King. The room overall was a bit cramped but again, with double beds that's often the case. The bed itself was very comfortable, plenty of pillows. Nice flat screen TV and free wireless access. On the downside no drinks in the fridge. Typically I couldn't care less about this but in this case I came in late (midnight) and wanted to grab a beer while I was unpacking. You can order things to to room but would have been good to have something readily available. Secondly, the door to the bathroom was situated that getting around it when gaining access to the toilet wasn't a natural move. Again, not a big deal but would expect this to be a non-issue in an A rated room. The shower/tub was large but just above average - not \"excellent\". The room decor was nice, and well taken care of. Thus the overall rating. On site Dining - A-: I ate primarily at the B-Line which was quick, efficient, and the staff was very friendly. Food was good however the selection was a bit limited. That however isn't a problem since they'll make you pretty much what you ask for. Loved the traditional Lobby bar - adjacent to the light and airy lobby bar. I believe it only opens at night. Was very relaxing. Downside is again a very limited snack menu. Gym B+/A-: Great equipment (If memory serves Cybex), free weights and practically new. The cardio area was in a different room. Again near new equipment and plenty of treadmills for the times I went in. I did hear stories of a line forming in the morning. The gym opens at 6;00 a.m. and closes at 10:00 or 11:00 thus the queue in the morning. They also had a separate area to stretch and mens and women's locker/shower rooms. By most hotel standards this was well above average but the separate rooms and lack of 24 hour availability knocked down my rating a bit. Great place overall.

There was no line and we were checked in quickly. We stopped at the concierge and he was useless. Absolutely useless. We tried to book appointments at the spa, but they didn't answer the phone. The store in the hotel is well stocked, but it's sooooo overpriced. There's a Walgreens right down International drive. Go there to get your sodas or water. I felt violated. The wifi was spotty. Be prepared. GO - to Oceanaire restaurant. It was great. Good service, amazing and fresh seafood and Scallops that made me want to cry.

This is an exquisite hotel with all of the bells and whistles--gorgeous gym, lovely spa including the retail section, wonderful, helpful staff, lots of restaurants, a beautifully landscaped pool with a jacuzzi, kiddie pool and slide, and towel hut with a pool restaurant. The hotel stores are very reasonable and have beautiful merchandise. They offer a reasonably priced shuttle service that they use to go to the parks and this gorgeous hotel is well- organized, and totally professional. There is a trolley line right outside the hotel that goes up and down International Drive and for $1.25 one way (free for children with one paying adult), you can't beat the prices. The hotel parking is reasonable. This hotel offers incredible value for what you get. The beds were incredibly comfortable, with a pillow top mattress and great pillows. If you need a very firm mattress, you may not like the bed. The sheets were clean and crisp. This is a non-smoking hotel, so there were no unpleasant smells (I detest cigarette and cigar smoke) except in the outdoor pool area and when you walk outside of the hotel. I think the hotel should have a strict policy about smoking outside on the premises. The chain smokers make it smell like stinky bars and nightclubs. I had a salad at the pool restaurant and it was huge and delicious and not unreasonably priced, considering the ingredients. The bathrooms were spacious. I had a regular room with two queen beds in the newest part of the hotel, and the towels were of very good quality, but nevertheless, the exfoliating kind. Ha! Ha! The bathroom amenities were Gilchrist and Soames lotion, shampoo and conditioner and the trademark duck soap for the bathtub. The bathtub was double wide, the hot water was always available and the water pressure was perfect. The bathroom fixtures were Kholer, with granite counter tops, a lighted make up mirror and great lighting. The toilet was very quiet. We never heard any noises from other guests except through the walls of the bathroom--the guest next door was a very loud talker. The remote-controlled tv in the mirror in the bathroom was funny. It always worked and my child enjoyed watching cartoons in there. The shower curtain was great, it was clean and I really wanted to buy one to take home. The cleanliness of the room was above average but not immaculate, as others have stated. There was dust on the back of the base of the table lamp on the nightstand and behind the nightstand mainly, but the bathroom always appeared to be spotless (my main concern) as well as the counter surfaces of the room. The floor to ceiling window was spotless. The refrigerator was stocked daily with two bottles of water that were paid for with the resort fee. I really loved this hotel and won't stay anywhere else when visiting Orlando. It was convenient to the parks, quiet and luxurious without breaking the bank. Also, my husband left his prescription glasses and they have an amazing lost and found service that fed ex'd them to our house. I called the day that we left the hotel when my husband discovered them missing and the hotel worked it all out quickly and efficiently. The management is fabulous from start to finish and it trickles down to the fabulous staff who are friendly and approachable at all times! Great job Peabody Orlando!

Unfortunately, the staff is not up to the challenge of running a quality hotel. For a hotel that advertises itself as perfect for special events, meetings, and conventions, the Peabody Orlando\u2019s staff was ill-prepared to handle the Holiday crowd at the end of 2011. Upon arriving at the Peabody on December 29th, we found that the staff had allowed 500 guests to check out late that day. This created a wait for in-coming guests, and despite the fact that we arrived at after 6:00 PM, our room was not ready. We were not the only party with this problem, and dozens of travel weary guests dotted the lobby waiting for their rooms. This issue continued during the next few days and I spoke to many guests who had to wait for their rooms as they attempted to check-in. The next morning we left to visit the theme parks at 7:00 AM. When we arrived at our room at 6:00 PM that night we found that housekeeping had neglected to visit the room. Tired, and needing to hurry to make our 8:00 PM dinner reservations, I was made to wait at the front desk for twenty minutes to speak to a manger. The room was finally cleaned, and after some discussion a credit courtesy was extended, but the inconvenience was suffered. I was assured by the manager that this mistake would not be repeated. The next day we left our room at 11:00 AM. The housekeeping staff was in the room next door and we bid them good morning as we departed. Upon our return at 5:00 PM\u2026 you guessed it\u2026 no housekeeping staff had visited our room. This time I was made to wait at the front desk for twenty-five minutes as the stupefied front desk person called the housekeeping manager. As I stood there, I spoke to a poor woman who had been waiting in the lobby for her room which was not ready, in spite of the fact that it was well past check-in time. The housekeeping manger was very nice, and very apologetic, but she had no idea why the room had not been visited by her staff. After demanding a straight answer she simply advised that, \u201cWe are very busy.\u201d Again, my family had to leave the room as the staff hurried to correct their mistake. Another courtesy was extended, and another inconvenience was endured. As I mentioned at the top of the review, this hotel is beautiful. The rooms, lobby area, pools, and restaurants are very nice, and I have no issues with the property itself. If the staff ever gets it's act together and learns how to handle their establishment during peak periods the Peabody will be an exceptional destination.

Secondly, the toiletries were very basic (only shampoo/conditioner, soap and lotion offered) in the otherwise VERY IMPRESSIVE bathroom (automatic motion-detecting night lights, IN MIRROR TV and over sized soaking tub in shower). Thermostat was stuck on AC but was fixed w/in 15 min. after a maintenance call at midnight. Pool area appeared fantastic! Wished we had time to indulge :(. All in all, it was an OK experience, but nothing stood out as exceptional. Wouldn't mind staying here again, but with the competition being so fierce in a town known for Hospitality/Tourism, we would probably opt for diff. lodging next time around. Hope this helps!

Seems like a downgrade from \"luxury\" to \"business class\" and slightly dysfunctional at that. Last time, I was in the original hotel and this time in Tower 2, so that might make a difference, but last time, it seemed MUCH more luxurious than this time around. I had trouble with my in-room safe upon arrival (promptly fixed) and didn't get a WiFi signal at all the first night, then a weak one on subsequent nights (I was there for 4.. for a conference). In the renovation, they did away with in-room coffeemakers and put in empty refrigerators (except for a couple bottles of water), with \"feed the fridge\" option from room service (overpriced and not too varied). They also added \"electric mirrors\" in the bathrooms.... mirrors with TVs embedded. Big whoop. The one in my room picked up about 5 channels. The room TV was better, but not by a landslide... very limited cable options, plus overpriced movies. Although I'm not a coffee drinker, I'd have preferred a coffeemaker to the newer amenities, as I'd have had the option to brew some tea without having to get dressed and go down to the lobby to get it. Heard the same complaint (only louder) from the coffee drinkers. Very dumb idea, they said... plus there's a surcharge to get the lobby coffee anyway. Really dumb. It's a huge hotel and connected to the convention center across the street, so one can walk to that without going outside, if desired. Their conference center facilities is what my group used. Nice, but nothing special, really. They placed glasses and water urns at the back of the rooms instead of having pitchers on the tables with glasses, as most other conference centers do. Same with pens and \"paper\" (actually little note cards). For the price, it was, again, disappointing. The first glass of water I got tasted like the urn had been used for coffee in the recent past, also... blech! Apparently, not well cleaned.. blech again! All in all, it's still a very nice hotel. The ducks are fun to watch. The restaurants in it have good food and service. The staff is friendly. The rooms are nice, clean and well kept. However, as I said earlier, I'd call it overpriced business class now instead of luxury...for Tower 2, at least. Probably won't return, unless a conference is there again and the boss picks up the tab. Maybe not even then. A colleague from another company stayed a mile away, took a taxi daily and still saved her boss over $125 daily... plus had a coffeemaker. I may do likewise in the future and would've done this time, if I had known what I now know. One item there I'd rate as excellent was room service breakfast.

Lots of lounge chairs and spots to choose from. The bar staff came around for drink orders. They were super friendly and the drinks were very good. We spent one day at the spa. The staff there are just awesome! I've been to many spas througout the country and Carribbean and these folks were the nicest I've experienced. We had the couples massage with the bath ritual. The bath was so beautiful...candles and flower petals. I just wish the staff would have mentioned we should bring our camera in to take a picture...it was very romantic and the massages were great. We spent the day being lazy in the lounge area, reading books and sipping tea. The room was fabulous, very comfy bed and sheets. We asked for a high floor and they were happy to accommodate. We just had to wait a bit longer and they called us when it was ready. Gave us time to take a walk and have lunch. Yes, the ducks are a riot! People start lining up around the red carpet 30 minutes before the march. The ducks waddled alot faster to get into the fountain than leaving the fountain, we noticed. The staff take a lot of pride in this tradition. We had several corporate events during our stay and all were amazing. I was impressed with their service and quality of food when catering to over 2,000!!! Big shout out to Oseas, who was our server at brunch on Monday morning. He was the best...friendly and attentive.

In addition, the staff was fantastic. All were beautifully uniformed, courteous, and friendly. The fitness center is truly state of the art. The housekeeping was impeccable. The pool was gorgeous with waterfalls and a slide for the kids, even a kiddie pool if you have really small children. The gift shop and lobby cafe were wonderful. Restaurant food, staff and ambience all unmatched. Best of all was the Duckmaster, whose name was really Donald! The kids loved visiting the ducks in their palace and then seeing them march to the fountain. BIG TIP: call ahead to see if your child can be an Honorary Duckmaster when the march to or from the fountain.

As he squeezed between patrons and tables, he would say \"Human car wash!\" As lovely--and as large--as the Peabody is, I often felt that my journey along the main floor was indeed a human car wash. With its huge conference spaces and proximity to the Orange County Convention Center, the hotel draws busfuls of conventioneers. And they seem to all converge along the length of the main floor, stretching from Napa/Rocks restaurant/bar on one end to the B-Line Diner on the other. It made moving quickly, or even at a normal pace, very difficult. Also, the mass of taxis, limos, cars, buses, etc at the various entrances made it difficult to unload luggage. The valets acted more like traffic cops, helping cars navigate the tangle of vehicles. My visit happened to coincide with the Republican Presidential nominee debates at the convention center and the Florida Republican straw poll. At one point when I needed to discuss something with a front-desk clerk, I encountered a line of at least 75 people trying to check into the hotel for the political festivities. Granted, it was probably an aberration, but it was inconvenient nonetheless. The only other real problem was that the concierge desk was understaffed in the morning. I waited 15 minutes just to be able to ask a simple yes-or-no question. In all fairness, I did notice 3 or 4 concierges at the desk in the evenings. Now that I've dispensed with the negatives, there is much to like about this property. I won't go into detail about things that have been discussed frequently on Trip Advisor, but I agree that the rooms were very nice and comfortable, the food was good, and the temperature in the hotel was easy to control. For me, the hotel stood out in two areas: the fitness facility and the pool. The surcharge for gym/coffee/newspaper is well worth it for the health club alone. It features a room with weight machines, an attached room with free weights, and a third \"core\" room, with bosus, balls, a stretching \"cage,\" mats, and similar equipment. There is also a large cardio area with treadmills, bikes, etc. There are also a spin room and two exercise studios, though I never saw those in use. As for the pool area, it is vast, as befits this behemoth of a hotel. For kids, there is a twisting water slide that was very popular. The pool itself is large but shallow--more for wading and milling around in. There also is a separate kids' pool. In addition, I noticed out my window that there is a nice lap pool somewhere else on the property, but I never got there. Finally, if you park in the hotel's garage, take a ride back to the hotel with Carmelo in the golf cart.

Story: We were in need of a little get away, Labor Day was starting on Friday, it was Thursday night at Eleven PM and my wife and I were still working at the office. I checked our favorite haunts but none met our budget or liking. It occurred to my wife to go ninety miles to Orlando for our old and all-time favorite place were stayed many times, years before. The Peabody Hotel. We made our Reservations late at night and were on our way by noon the next day, I was a little concerned that Expedia, Oyster or Bookit (Idid not remember who we dealt with) had confirmed my reservation. I called the Peabody, Cheameil in reservations, who confirmed our stay and asked if this was our first time. I explained that it had be a while but we love the Peabody, however this was my nine month old granddaughters first trip. She asked if I could hold for a moment, came back and said that she had received authorization to upgrade our rooms and would see to it that a Baby Bed, full size Microwave and extra refrigerator were in the room. When we arrived we discovered that we also were given Valle parking and Club Level Rooms overlooking their new many acre new pool resort. The staff, from Jason at the front desk, Delores at the B-Line Diner, the Bellman who has been there for twenty four years were all exceptional at making you realize that you were important to them. Again and again they were so helpful and I would ask why they were so \"over the top\"? It was Kelly or Megan in the Club Lounge who when I asked that question; what was the Peabody difference?

Another Orlando hotel scam practised by the majority of hotels. 3) There is a $15 daily charge for rollaway bed. We were aware of all of these charges before we travelled. 4) We arranged prior to arrival for all our kids to be duckmasters for the day. The Duckmaster contacted us via Email and arranged it all. The kids had a brilliant time and loved it. Quite nerve racking for them as there are a lot of people watching. Duckmaster was superb, a lovely man, who thoroughly enjoyed his job ( Management if you read this I hope you take note!!!) Negatives Only one which didn't affact the experience.

Perhaps being August, there may not have been a big conference on, but sun loungers were plentiful, along with towels and cold towels served pool side! I had a couple of cocktails and they were magic also. Whilst leaving the hotel ( to get to my hire car), the staff seemed rather perplexed that we should choose to walk the 200 metres or so in the heat, when for the price of a tip they would talk you there in a golf buggy. Those people that were driven, looked like they could have done with the exercise! The Multi storey car park was really clean and not threatening like some back home. I did sample the internet via the business centre one night, and also had dealings with the Consierge desk - both were first class.

Our stay met and exceeded all expectations. The valets and bellhoppers greeted me and my wife with a pleasant attitude. I opted for self-parking, so our bags were securely taken to the front desk area. The lobby was exquisite; more importantly, there were plenty of agents available, and check-in was efficient. The room was finely equipped with an I-pod deck/alarm clock radio, wired/wireless internet access, telephone, mini-fridge, complimentary peabody bath robes, ironing board w/iron, and a safe. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were changed consistently. The bathroom was marbleous, with a mini-tv inside a mirror. The shower/tub was large and the toiletries and towels were replaced daily, although they ask that you conserve, if possible. I toured a good portion of the hotel, including some of the conference rooms. It's consistently neat and clean throughout the various sections. There are several dining options and we chose to eat at the B-line Diner for breakfast. The food was very good; however, as other reviews have noted, it is costly. My wife loves nature, and she insisted on seeing the ducks marching. While we missed their entrance, we did get to see them in their pond. The Duckmaster was friendly and extremely knowledgable. He angaged me and my wife for 15 minutes, while children and others were taking pictures. This definitely was the highlight of our stay. The pool, spa, and fitness centers were thoroughly equipped and had friendly staff. It was refreshing to note that the Peabody takes pool safety seriously, as there was always someone monitoring the pool slide. You could not go down until the other person cleared the immediate area. In summation, the Peabody was one of the finest hotels that I've stayed in. It's family friendly, an intimate place for couples, and ideal for business travelers. This is a hard combination to pull off, but the Peabody does it. I'm not sure how it was previously, but the renovations look incredible. The people are helpful and friendly. There are some things to know: there is a daily parking and hotel fee, dining at the hotel is expensive, the parking garage is separate from the hotel, but there are always shuttles running to accommodate guests and their luggage. Several hotels and shopping centers are within walking distance, and there are quite a few \"entrances\" into the hotel. Make sure you see valets and bellhops, otherwise you're at the convention side of the hotel, and a long way from check in. I will stay here again and throughly enjoyed my stay", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, UK", "Title": "\u201cSorry. Another 5* Review\u201d", "Author": "Khonsu", "ReviewID": "UR116180448", "Content": "Where to start with The Peabody. Location. At the south end of International Drive, across the road from Pointe Orlando, bars, restaurants, cinema, shops etc. Am I allowed to say \"the nice end\" of International Drive. The hotel oozes professionalism and class. From pulling up on our airport transfer coach - more on that later - and being met by a group of bell hops/valet chaps for our luggage. Check in was a breeze. After a 6 hour delay at Gatwick, our arrival was 11.30pm. It may as well have been 1pm in the afternoon given the welcome we were given and the smoothness of the booking in process. Yes - there is a $9 a night hotel charge payable on book in. Get over it those who complain about this. Every hotel now has some kind of charge. For this you get your daily paper, 2 bottles of water, free internet (I checked into work regularly from our room with no performance issues) and i-Trolley tickets free daily. (Free shuttling up and down International Drive - a must do even if you have a car. You see so much more.) We were also given a free upgrade - nice. We were in tower 2 on 15th Floor. The room was gorgeous. Still a hotel room but spotless, up to date (others have mention tv and bathroom mirror tv) and roomy. 6 lifts to each floor, no waiting, express lifts meant you may have been on 4th floor. Free safe in each room is nice to have. Fridge is roomy - our always had a few beers, coke, powerade type drinks and chocolate - hey, it was 95 degrees most days at the parks... you needed to have energy. Room service were great. We had no complaints on the service on any day. Even if we left the room at midday. Do not disturb was always respected. Rest of the hotel. HUGE. Few key points. The shop in-hotel is beyond ridiculous on it's pricing - geared at business people with expense accounts I think. An example, a pack of 2 AA batteries - $6.99. In the theme parks they were only $6 for a pack of 4. $4 for a bottle of water. $6 for a small bar of chocolate...it was endlessly too expensive. The steak house restaurant in house was an average of $40 for an entree. No need when the very best steak houses outside the hotel were $30 for the most expensive steaks (16oz New York Strip at Cattlemans - oh my word....died and gone to heaven). B-Line Diner has been mentioned several times. Not cheap, not expensive. A lovely experience whether breakfast or a late night meal. Staff are great - we turned up needing breakfast at 11.30am when they stopped at 11am. Not a problem - breakfast menu re-appeared in a flash. B-Line is a great option when you literally crawl back into the hotel in the evening after a park knowing you will not make it back out. It is also good for take away should you want to be by the pools some day to recover (nice link eh!). We visited two pools. The ground floor pools, the curvy/water slides kind of pool was ok. Too shallow for swimming - great for kids. Coconut Shack for food and drinks was reasonable. We only went their once, no complaints - just too manic for a relaxing day. The terrace pool is fantastic. For adults peace time. No thrills, about 5ft 6\" in the deep bit, 25m long. Great for throwing a ball, lane swimming, or just lazing around. Kind of hidden away so it was never crowded. I was in there on my own one day and a company had a \"team building\" day basically around it - very amusing to watch people suffering what I had many times. The Ducks.... well - you think \"how silly I'll not bother\". We caught it by accident and it was sweet/funny and very glad we made it. Disney Shuttles. There is a transfer/ticket desk. Not the friendliest of people but know their stuff. Cost $10 each way to any Disney park - compared to taxi's an absolute bargain. You're looking at $50 each way to Magic Kingdom. Buy your Disney tickets before you go to Orlando - tip if you know you'll only go to each park once - look for the Disney Base Tickets... you save about \u00a380 a ticket. Oh yes - the Airport shuttle. We booked through Travel Republic - no complaints there. The actual shuttle was American Coach. Rubbish. We waited an hour at the airport for their minibus to fill up - and then a further 30 mins for the driver to then move. After a 6 hour delay, you don't need that. Worse than that was the return trip. We confirmed 24 hours in advance as instructed and were waiting to be picked up 15 minutes before. 15 mins after the pickup time we phoned and were told 15mins. Then phoned again - 20 mins. Then again. 15 mins. Then 10. etc etc. It was 1 1/2 hours late - obviously they shunted people to fill the mini bus. Not to be recommended - but then you may not have a choice. Tip would be to phone the confirmation number again 15 minutes before pickup time - that way they know you'll hassle them. If you're like me and have speed read the above, then take note that to us, The Peabody was the best hotel on the \"Drive\". By a country mile. Oh - and a lot of other hotels we looked like Doubletree were nice ...but nothing around them! You'd need a car. We most definitely did not.

It is however a short 5 minute walk to Pointe Orlando which is shopping, dining and nightlife in one convenient location. The room was nice and had some nice features you expect in a luxury hotel (motion sensored night lights,tv in bathroom mirror, spa robes, 24 hour room service, comfortable beds). We did not eat at the restaurants but they all looked nice and had great sounding menus. There are multiple pools, slides, a children's \"beach\" area, pool bars and restaurant. It's nice that the pool is open until 11 pm. There is a spa in the hotel, however we did not have any services done due to our limited time. The hotel bars are open until 1:30 am. The check-in was quick and simple. As was the checkout. My only complaints were that valet is $20 per day, self parking is $15 but quite a long walk. Also, my room was obviously not dusted when cleaned, and the tv in the bathroom mirror almost never worked. There is also a resort fee of $10 per day they inform you of upon check-in. We were told this covers the Trolley passes, high-speed Internet, waters daily in your fridge and a New York Times paper every morning at your door. But at least they tell you what the fee is for, a lot of hotels just charge you and give no explanation. Overall we were happy with our stay at the Peabody. The ducks marching to the fountain on the red carpet in the morning and evenings is always entertaining. There is always somewhere to get something to eat or drink 24hours. Your car is always ready for you if you call valet before you leave your room. There are also shops, fitness center, tennis courts, etc to keep you entertained.

The ducks waddling into the pool in the lobby still attracts huge amounts of tourists at the appointd times.

While waiting on the manager, two \"young adults\" strolled through the lobby holding thier pants below their cheeks with their undergarmets showing! No one said a thing!

I then asked if the hotel had any decency standards and was told there was \"nothing he or anyone could do!\" I told him I was dumb founded that a private organization couldn't require people in their public places to \"pull up their pants!\" The Memphis Peabody is so nice; but this Peabody demonstrated no concern as to the decorum and/or decency of those walking through their lobby. The rooms are extremely nice but the \"guests\" they will gladly welcome in order \"to fill it up\" are no more than 2-star!

The coffee provided is okay. I am not an Orlando hotel pool expert, but I\u2019d have to guess that the new Peabody pool is one of the best in the area. The fitness center may be the best I\u2019ve seen at a hotel anywhere. We took the I-Ride trolley to Sea World and it was great.

Our nightly base rate is $78/night. Our room overlooks the roof of the convention area, and two men painting the side of the hotel.

However, I\u2019ve never been one to sit in my room and look out the window on vacation, especially one in this area. It is a convention hotel, and there were two going on when we arrived. The hotel is right next to the Orange County Convention Center, however there is nothing currently happening there now (holiday week). Convention goers usually don\u2019t take up space at a pool all day anyway. My only complaint is that when I originally called the hotel to check my reservation I was told that the resort fee was optional. At check-in I was told that he resort fee was a mandate. When I spoke to a concierge I was asked if I opted into the resort fee, and then when I asked a customer service rep on the phone later about this, I was told it was a mandate. That is very annoying. I would have opted out as I already have wireless Internet with me on the trip. if you are paying top dollar to stay here, then get to the bottom of this \"option\".

The hotel counts with 3 restaurants and the dinner was a very good option for a great breakfast before going to the parks. There was also a snack bar, where we could have quick bites and a store with eatable products. It is a very big hotel, with a convention center, but an impecable assistance. The bellman were very helpful and helped us with our luggage every time we came from the outlets, parks, etc. We opted for the self parking in a garage building next to the hotel, but the golf cart picked us when we wanted.

The soundproofing is poor, so you can hear people in the hallway and next door yelling/talking. We were put in the room at the end of the hall next to the Ice Machine so I could hear that noise all night long. The layout of the bathroom was cramped, but the worse part was our tub was CLOGGED when I went to take a shower. Gross. The metal cap underneath the tub faucet/spout was also broken and falling off. I would see the rusting and mildew inside. Worst of all, Housekeeping refused to change my bed linens even though I placed the \"Please Change Bed Linens\" card clearly and plainly on my pillow. The bed was re-made by housekeeping, but the linens were not changed and I could tell because my daughter had been eating crackers the day before and there were cracker crumbs on the INSIDE part of the sheets. Basically, housekeeping remade the bed and replaced the bed linen card so that I would think the sheets were changed. THEY WERE NOT. With so many families staying in Orlando---why is the smoking section outside the front doors of the hotel? Many families stand at the Valet turn around to wait for their rental cars. It is idiotic to put the smoking section near this area, where many kids sit and wait for cars. With so many hotel options in Orlando, you should look elsewhere.

Loved the built-in tv in the large round mirror in the bathroom. (which doesn't get fogged up) What a nice touch to have the sensored nightlights that come on as you step around the rooms in the dark. The bed and pillows could not possibly have been more comfortable! Speaking of comfortable, they really have thought of every need...robes, a refrigerator, a safe, even an umbrella. They have some really cool \"stock the fridge\" packages you can purchase. (which didn't appear to be as outrageously expensive as you might expect) Absolutely adored the duck theme everywhere...from the cute little duck soap in the bathroom, to the ducks on the bathmat...every time you turned around there was another cute duck to admire. And, of course, the duck parade is not to be missed!

I managed to get a fantasic rate and called reservations before actually booking to make sure I would not encounter the same issues like the previous hotel. I called reservations and was helped by two exceptional ladies call Stephanie and Diana, I can not praise these ladies enough, excellent in every way and more importantly very understanding to my needs. So off I went kids in tow for my 10 days, now this hotel is as beautiful as the website pictures show, infact I dont think the website pictures do it justice as it really is nice and modern (even the older part looks good for its age) Check in was ok, although reception need to tell guests upon check in what ammeneties are included, I booked very last minute and I forgot it was only until I got up to the room after some hours and I read the in room info that I remembered that the trolley pass, local calls, ect..are included, but if you dont read the info in room or booked way ahead so not likely to remember you will never know this due to recepion not telling you and if you booked via a 3rd party like expedia then you are really stuffed as that info is not always in the description. I am a creature of modern comforts and this hotel, especially the rooms has it all, the bathroom TV was a delight, the bed super comfy, lots of space, nice decor...however I stay in an awful lot of hotels and most of them are 4-5 star, so seeing a glitzy room can no longer cloud my judgement and I base a lot of my opinions of a hotel on service rather than style and this is where this hotel falls short. Concierge : Pretentious and snooty are the best words to describe them, the Peabody needs to figure out if they want to be a business or family hotel, I was speaking with a staff member who explained for many years they were more more a business client hotel which would explain the \"professionalisim\" to the point of frosty and cold from nearly all the concerige staff, but if they are trying to pull familes in they really need to drop the attitude. I asked \"Nathan\" on concerige if they had an ice machine, I was told \"Well of course\" with a tone that suggested I was some kind of hill-billy for even asking, now bearing in mind there is nothing I could find in the room to tell you where the ice machine was located I just assumed like some 4* deluxe and 5* hotels in the UK, they did not have a ice machine because it is usually sent up to you free of charge through room service. That was just one of many attitude issues I had with concierge,I also had an issue with being given wrong information by another lady on concerige who equally had a stinking attitude, and ended up speaking with Marlina the duty manager, who was a total delight, professional, friendly, bent over backwards to help sort things out. I think the majority of the concerige staff are straight out of college as they all seemed a bit young and inexperienced and you could see hints of attitude and diva strops coming through if things got a bit tough for them. Housekeeping: I am still unsure if I just got the short straw in the housekeeping department or if this is how the whole HK team operate. The first 4-5 days were ok, but by day 5 I realised that the room had not been hoovered (1 adult and 2 children with one being a toddler the room by the way) or if it had been it was a very bad job, lots of smear marks still left on tables, thick dust around bedside lamp, ipod stereo and TV and also on the shelves where they fold and put the towels, bathroom not being mopped (my toddler cant quite aim well so lets just say when he misses you know about it after some days if not cleaned properly) fridge not shut properly after refilling with water (they did this 3 times by the way) which caused my sons milk to go off as the cupboard the fridge is located is very warm, some days I got shower gel, some days didn't, this kind of stuff should not be occuring in this level of hotel, how can you have a guest stay for 10 days and midway through their stay not give the room a deep clean?!? Clearly they do not have many long stay guests as I had to call up housekeeping twice about this as the room was getting pretty dirty (the first time fell on deaf ears) but in fairness I blame the supervisors, they are the ones who are supposed to inspect the rooms and they are the ones who are allowing this poor standard of cleaning to go on. Bell Hop: Overall they were pretty friendly, but upon check in not one of them even bothered to try and help me (and one guy actually looked over at me) with my 2 large suitcases, pram and kids, so was left to struggle with this up to me room on my own and neither did the lady at reception ask if I needed help, but at that stage I was just happy to be out fo the other hotel. Reception: Other than chek in and check out I did not have much contact with reception, I have mentioned about check in, not the best as they lady who check me in could have been more informative but nothing could prepare me for the receptionist named \"Britney\" She has no business working front of house, and she should be kept on switchboard back of house! the most sour faced, miserable rude receptionist I have had the misfortune of encountering, she gave my son a scornful look becasue he was making some noise, she asked to see my ID as they was some credit on my account and she inspected my ID more than immigration did upon enty to the USA, I understand the need to do this, but you really had to be there to see how far she took this as if I was some kind of criminal..yes Britney, that kind of behaviour is going to really want guests to back to the Peabody!?! There was no \"how was your stay\" no \"goodbye\" nothing, just processed me out in silence...total utter disgrace of a receptionist and whoever hired her ought to be ashmed to have her there! On a postive, the pool guys were all really nice, Britney who worked in the B-line was lovely and always friendly and helpful and as I mentioned for the most part the bell hop guys were usually happy and polite, the guys who worked in the coffee shop next to the main hotel shop were all nice also so there are the odd diamonds in the rough at the Peabody, but the really good staff who truly understand customer service are all sadly back of house for the most part, but if all the staff had the attitude of the likes of Marlina, Stephanie and Diana, I see no reason why the Peabody can not be one of the top 10 hotels in Orlando. Would I stay again? I am still unsure, but one thing is for certain is if I do, it will be 7 days or less as housekeeping seem to just give up after day 5!", "Date": "April 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, NH", "Title": "\u201cA very pleasant surprise.\u201d", "Author": "RJAllard", "ReviewID": "UR105866441", "Content": "Stayed here while in the area visiting colleges with my son.

The staff including the bell hops, waiter/waitresses, housekeeping, cashiers, front desk attendance and even room service answering line were AMAZINGly cordial and compleltely professional. The food was top notch at all venues EXCEPT Napa resturant (which I will touch upon after the positives!) We are true foodies-infact we spent a few hours each day at Sea World and Aquatica and made it a point to round out our days by @Noon so we could have lunch at the Peabody. Not to be missed are the Coconut Shrimp with a peanut Thai salad, Beef Empanadas with homemade salsa, Chicken Quesadillas (which are made with fresh grilled chicken on a spinach tortilla) served with homemade mango salsa all poolside at the Coconut Grill. Room service was also terrific with a Orange infused brioche french toast. Breakfast and lunch at the B Line Diner were equally delic as well. Our dinner at the Cipriccio Grill was one of the best of my times with Kobe beef and a Filet with blue cheese that would knock your socks off. Our waiter there-Luis was fabulous and made our experience just a really special night!! Now I want to warn patrons of the Napa resturant which is seems is tauted as a \"high\" end venue at the Peabody. I only write this now, so that you do not spend $250 on a meal that is below acceptable. We do not mind spending twice as much as that on a meal that is superior-but ours was far from it. We ordered Mussels as one of the appetizers, they were not only cold but the broth they were served in was a bland red tomato sauce perhaps out of a can? One person is our party ordered \"Halibut\" and as avid fishermen, we knew that this was stripped bass at first taste. We guessed correct when our bill came it listed not Halibut but Stripped Bass-go figure. Two people in our party ordered the Ahi Tuna-terrible as well and served with I believe white minute rice??? We walked away hungry-and dissappointed. The next day upon checking out we just gave an FYI to the Front desk when we were asked about our stay-lovely except for the meal at Napa-I believe my husband is writing a letter to the manager so he/she could perhaps experience a meal at Napa \"undercover\" so that the could rectify the chefs short comings???

We had just spent a few days at Disney's Beach Club. While the Peabody is a nicer hotel with much nicer rooms, the service pales in comparison to what we received at Disney. Our first issue came right away when we tried to find the entrance. With no signs indicating that there were two entrances to the hotel, we took the first one. There were bell hops outside of this entrance so it looked valid. Stepping inside there was no check-in desk and no one around to ask (and again no signs pointing the way). After wandering around I found a concierge who was entirely unimpressed at having to answer my simple question as to the location of the check-in desk. Turns out there was a new entrance... quite a ways from where we had came in. The bell hops that we had first seen had not mentioned anything, they had not bothered to greet us and had in no way indicated that we should be going further down to check in. Check-in at 8pm took 45min. For that time of day the length of time is absolutely ridiculous! When we found the new entrance the bell hops did not offer to help us with luggage but rather were more concerned with talking among themselves and acted as if they were too good for any of the guests at the hotel. The room (in the new tower) was very spacious, very comfortable and well appointed. The bathroom was the largest that I have seen at a hotel. Overall, very, very nice rooms. Unfortunately, that's the best thing that I can say about this hotel. Maid service during the day cleaned the room around 3-4pm. I've never had maid service come that late anywhere that I have stayed before. Food at the hotel is outrageous - $8 for a large latte, it's not gold and the people making it are certainly not skilled barristas since I can make a better latte. Luckily there are plenty of restaurants on International Dr that are a short walk away. Perhaps I would not have been so disappointed if I had not just come from Disney (where my room was cheaper than at the Peabody at one of the Deluxe resorts) but I was completely underwhelmed by the service here. I found that the employees were very rude, had no concept of service and really did not want to be there.

Upon check-in I was told that the room class I had reserved, a regular king, was unavailable, but the desk clerk offered to upgrade me to an \"executive\" king at no additional cost. He told me the bed in the room was different in that it was \"low,\" which sounded OK. In reality the bed was a pull-down, Murphy-style bed, which seemed odd and not really accurately described. The bed was comfortable, though, and the room was HUGE--much larger than a typical studio apartment. It was a nice room, though somwhat soulless and boring.. One thing that displeased me was that the desk clerk \"upsold\" me into paying an extra $10/day \"service fee\" which he said included a couple of bottles of water per day, two all-day passes for the International Drive trolley, and high-speed wi-fi internet. I figured that was worth it for the wi-fi along, but actually, the internet would've been free even if I hadn't opted for the \"upgrade;\" housekeeping kept forgetting to leave me the bottles of water so I got them only one day of the three (when I spotted a maid in the hallway and asked for them); and the trolly passes are only worth $1.50 each--and for this I paid an extra $30 over the 3-day stay. This is an ENORMOUS hotel, with a property comparable in size to the large Las Vegas resorts. I didn't get to take advantage of the hotel amenities such as pool, because the weather was bad during my stay. I did eat at a couple of the restaurants, the \"B Line\" (which the desk clerk dismissively but accurately described as \"an upgraded Denny's sort of place,\" which was true because the food was completely forgettable) and Napa (which aims at a \"California Wine Country\" sort of menu but, to a Californian at least, misses that target pretty badly, though the prices are compable to or higher than what one would pay at most genuine upscale Napa Valley restaurants). There are some nice bars and lounges, though the prices are fairly absurd ($8 for a domestic beer, for example). The location is on a busy major thoroughfare with nothing nearby except the convention center, other large hotels, and some strip malls.

There is a coffee cafe and the coffee they served was really subpar. It was also lousy - basically undrinkable - in their upscale restaurant (I can't recall the name). The B-Diner's coffee was great so if they make that the standard coffee throughout the rest of the hotel (I understand they use different blends) that would be a big help.

The convention center space was very nice, and I enjoyed speaking at the conference. Unfortunately, it was nearly impossible to sleep in this hotel. The first room I started in was extremely hot and stuffy. I called the front desk and they sent a maintenance person to the room. He took a needle nose plier to the air vents wiggling each one, telling me he needed to re-direct the air. He then replaced the air filter, which did seem to increase air flow, but did nothing to cool or de-humidify the air. A few hours later, around 10pm, I called down to the front desk and asked to be moved to another room. The front desk sent up a bellman with keys to a new room. We went to the new room, and he admitted that our choices were limited because the hotel was nearly full. He conceded that the new room wasn\u2019t much cooler. I decided to gamble and make the switch. The new room was slightly cooler, but still unacceptable. I woke up the first night sweating. I was confused because during the night the room became much hotter than it was before I went to sleep. After a little internet research, at 2AM, I was able to determine this was because the thermostats are controlled by motion sensors. If there isn\u2019t enough movement, the system shuts off. Fortunately, I was able to figure out the sensor override code. If you search the interne t using the name on the control panel you should be able to find it without much effort. This at least keeps the air on, but still didn\u2019t adequately cool the room. I called the front desk the next day to complain about the room temperature again, hoping that there was something that could be done. They sent another bellman up to the room, the front desk had claimed that he could help me out. When the bellman got to the room he said this was the second room he had been to that shift which was set to 65 degrees, but was obviously much higher (I would guess at least 75 with high humidity). He started hitting the fan speed button on the thermostat, and then left it at medium. He said, there, I set it to medium, so that should cool down the room quickly. I also asked him if he knew about the over ride code, but he claimed he had never heard of it. I figured I wasn\u2019t going to get anywhere with him, both because he didn\u2019t know about the over ride and because I had long ago figured out how to adjust the fan speed. I thanked him for his time. Throughout this ordeal, I was told numerous times that this was a green hotel, so they were required to have the motion sensing thermostats. I am sure that is true, but I would imagine you can be green and still get the temperature in the room to a comfortable level.

Wonderful service and friendly people. The portions are generous, although expect to pay more than you would outside a hotel. The room makeup times varied throughout our stay. It was nice to bump into the housekeeping ladies though, they were friendly, as were the people on the concierge desk which was well staffed. The pool was a good size, and despite record low temperatures people were still swimming in it! The hotel has free passes for the i-Ride trolley bus, which is a bonus with stops a short walk from the entrance. We used the trolley to get to and from the Outlet Malls, Sea World and Universal, although we also swapped to taxis for quicker trips. For British travellers I would recommend against ordering tea. It's not what you get back home (honey and lemon). There's no coffee/tea making facilities in the room either. The fridge in the room had complimentary water (ideal for a day at the theme park), and a special menu so that you could stock the fridge with food and drink. Looking at other hotels nearby I would wonder what they could offer that you couldn't get at The Peabody. There's a pharmacy/store nearby, The Capital Grille steak restaurant is a short walk away. Rooms are comfy, staff are friendly.

There was plenty to do at the hotel, though the fitness center steam room and whirlpool were broken. \"Free\" trolly tickets (included in daily $15.98 fee) allowed us to travel to places along International Drive without having to move the car, (parked in the garage for another $12 daily fee/ $20 if you want to valet). We took the trolly to Cafe Tu-Tu Tango, a favorite, and to the Outlets. The completely remodeled 26th floor room in the \"old\" tower was lovely. Loved the bathroom and separate area for changing and luggage. You could use the fridge, but there is no coffeemaker or microwave in the room. Great TVs in bed and bath rooms. The downside, and this was an issue that may be just seasonal, was as the college bowl team hotel, the entire fan base stayed there. Never a free time to use the hot tub outside, the pool was so crowded that we had to sit on the edge of the pool deck with our feet in the water to \"relax\". Enjoying a relaxing afternoon by the pool on a warm New Year's Eve day was not an option. We ate at the B-line diner for breakfast which was decent but overpriced. They have spectacular desserts and I would highly recommend the chocolate mousse cake...heavenly. There we were able to get our $3 regular coffee. If there was free coffee, I am not sure where it was since there was nothing in our room about anything ...no in room directory aside from a magazine. The beautiful, trendy Rocks lounge had $20 sliders that were insanely good {did we really pay $20 for three sliders? oh yes we did} with great drinks. We chose to do Neew Year's Eve there and enjoyed the balloon drop and lounge band enough, though it was lacking some energy. As we were unwinding, I had to walk (in heels) down 26 flights of stairs as the fire alarm went off for a false alarm around 1 a.m.! That really was disappointing (and painful) after such a nice evening. As for the ducks, they are cute, but maybe better to see on a less crowded day.

One thing I have not seen mentioned in the reviews I read was the great location on International Drive. Coming from San Diego, CA, I wasn't familiar with this area and only choose this hotel as it was the chosen \"team\" hotel for Michigan State University, who was playing in the Capital One Bowl. While I wasn't happy with my team's performance in the bowl game, I thoroughly enjoyed this hotel and my stay, even despite a 1:30 a.m. on NYE fire/fire alarm and evacuation. The hotel is situated right next to a lovely shopping area with many bars, restaurants and shops - I think it was called the Pointe. Great and easy to walk to and lots of options. Our room's view was lacking - but the furnishings more than made up for it. The bed was so comfy I didn't want to leave it. I traveled with an injured back and was a bit anxious regarding the bed - but it more than lived up to my hopes. The room (king bed) was actually pretty large, with a sitting area, lounge chair and ottoman and a separate desk and chair. The TV was probably 42 inches, flat screen and nice. I LOVED the digital TV in the bathroom mirror - I want one at home now! The bathroom was a bit \"tight\" on space, but fine for the two of us. No separate tub and shower, they were a combo. I liked the 'feed the fridge\" program versus the usual mini bar. You order what you want from a menu and they bring it right up. Prices were reasonable. I found the pool area, which was nice, was crowded and we had trouble finding a chair. That was disappointing. The roof top pool was closed for repairs (we weren't warned about this at booking or check-in, so I deducted on the rating). Also the valet parking was OK - I found the valets a bit difficult to deal with). We ate at Napa restaurant in the hotel on NYE and it was delicious! It is new, opened about 4 months ago. The service was excellent and the pricing reasonable. The bar/lounge above Napa (I forget the name) was nice, had a band. The hotel is large, but we found it easy to get around. We booked through a consolidator web site and got a TERRIFIC rate. I liked the free Wifi in the room and the morning paper (though why the New York Times?). There is a daily resort fee of about $15 - which I believe covers the wifi and 2 free bottles of water per day and the pool usage.

The hotel is HUGE (a large part of the hotel is a convention area, and there is even an over-the-highway walkway that leads to the Orange County Convention Center next door) and beautifully decorated with paintings/sculptures/artwork throughout (the colossal chandeliers are fabulous!). The new pool area is large, the heated pool (a \"no-entry\" pool) is gorgeous, with a big slide for the kids, and an oversized hot tub, with easy access (although unfortunately it was too COLD outside for us, we're Floridians, to swim); and, there are multiple restaurant/cafe/bar facilities throughout the hotel and pool area that serve anything from a quick snack to sandwiches to a full-course meal (our favorite, with the best price for the value, was the B-Line Diner). There is also a shopping/restaurant area within a block's walking distance (includes B.B. King's, Maggiano's Italian Restaurant, Regal IMAX CInemas, WonderWorks, shops like Victoria's Secret, Chico's, Ciao!). We stayed in the \"new\" tower area (just opened in 2010). Our room was spacious, and the beds were oversized, and VERY comfortable (love the SOFT sheets/bedding!), and all the room amenities provided (including a mini-fridge, wet bar, and even a TV in the bathroom MIRROR!) were great! And, one of the best things about the Peabody is the \"DUCK MARCH\" that takes place twice a day; what a wonderful tradition to continue over the years, it's a LOT of fun (just watching the people react to the ducks coming down their \"red carpet\" from the elevator is hilarious)! In a nutshell - if you want a moderately-priced, classy, elegant, extremely comfortable hotel, with a professional staff that looks to provide you with all that you'll need during your stay, you can't beat the Peabody, and we HIGHLY recommend it! It's only drawback is that, because of its location on S.

Our room looked over the pool part of the resort. There was a lap pool & gym but we did not visit those. However, the lagoon area with palm trees and heated pools were phenomenal, there were rock formations, bridges, waterfalls (including in the pool), kiddy beach area, tunnel slide, and more. The grounds were impeccable, the service was first rate, there was PLENTY of staff which was SO good to have! I am so tired of going places that are short staffed apparently due to the economy yet the places are obviously in need of more help-Anyway, there must have been a dozen Christmas trees decorated, wonderful art decor everywhere, a large clean and well equipped business center.

The pastries and baked goods on display in the restaurant were fantastic looking and so good that you wanted to eat them all! Really the only negatives were the added costs that you will incur (resort fees and parking), which is not out of the oridnary for a hotel of its caliber, but perhaps out of the oridary for Orlando accomodations. So if you're coming here - just be aware that its generally a step above other hotels in the area - and be prepared to pay as such. Its also rather close to the Universal Studios - we took a cab ride there and it was only about $10 each way, which is another great positive. The resort fee also gets you on free to the I-drive trolley, so lots and lots of dining and shopping options are quickly available to guests.

We stayed in the new tower \"2\" which had only been open 3 weeks. When we arrived, our reservation paperwork said \" 1 king bed\" . Upon checking in, they only had two doubles available. What upscale hotel still offers two doubles? After 45 minues of arguing, we were given a room with two queens which was okay. When we entered the room, we noticed that it was dusty. My fiancee was able to write her name on the bathroom mirror in the dust. The remote control had stickcy stuff on it and was covered with dust. I went for ice and couldnt find the ice machine so I asked the room attendant. She told me that she had no idea where the ice machine was so I wandered the floor for a while until I found it. There were many other issues that should have not happened at a higher end hotel being a seasoned traveler. Hoping not to have to write a review, we met with Mr. Marshall Kelberman, the manager of rooms for the Peabody. He was very polite and assured us that he would make things right. He did take some money off of our bill. Unfortunately, immediately after that evening, when returning from several work events, we returned to our room and found that the room staff had forgotten to place the 4 glasses in our room for beverages; although they did take the dirty ones away. After calling, they did bring us glasses after some time. Upon check out, when leaving the parking garage, unfortunately our key card became demagnetised at the cross arms. We pushed the help button and no one answered. We pushed it again and again and nothing. After a while, we called the Peabody main desk and they sent a bus staff member to let us out. Why do they have help buttons in the parking structure if there is no monitoring? Overall, the hotel needs quite a bit of help. This was just a quick summary.

The hotel usually takes care of me beautifully, however, the last two trips have been borderline at best. This last trip was meant to be a nice weekend with my son and out of town family (they stayed at Disney while my son and I stayed safely far enough away at the Peabody). The room was a newly renovated room and still smelled of fresh paint. Perfectly appointed, except for the remote that worked when it sensed it was close to being launched across the room and the TV that would intermittently lose audio for 5 seconds at a time every 10 minutes. Coincidentally, right about the time the local weather was being broadcasted. Typically, the hotel leaves a kind note and chocolate covered strawberries in the room. Not that they are on my diet, but my teenage son rather enjoys them and the touch was a thoughtful gesture. By not having them in the room when we returned late from dinner and my turn down service request ignored, I see this as an indicator that the level of service is not quite being the same as in the past years. The valet was completely understaffed and even with a call ahead 10 to 15 minutes prior, they always seemd to take an additional 5 minutes to bring the car around. The final \"F\" on this experience has to do with their lack of total customer service. My son had left an important item accidentally in the room. When it was noticed (within 24 hours of our departure), I promptly called the hotel and was hung up on and transferred around until I finally was connected with someone in \"Lost and Found\". This gentleman assured me that the item would be returned, but would need a credit card to pay for the shipping. As if I hadn't paid enough all ready for \"services\", but not being one to quibble, I provided my credit card information and was told that it would be sent out by the business office, Fedex ground, that day. I live 3 hours from Orlando, it would have arrived to me in 2 days at the most if it was sent out within reason from the day I called into the hotel. Over a week later, and after going through the same rounds of calling in, being hung up on, and transferred I finally have a tracking number that shows it really takes over a week to ship something 3 hours south. I should have just gone back and picked it up myself. If you are used to or are looking for an exceptional experience, this hotel would no longer be my first choice.

Service and value, however, should have been stepped up in order to accommodate for these inconveniences, and it simply wasn't. Guests are certainly paying for convenience here--- the menu prices for drinks and food items were outrageously priced for the lack of atmosphere and just-so-so quality of food. We encountered several issues during our stay. First, although we were told to call down 15 minutes in advance of needing our car from valet, we could not do this because both of the phones in our room were broken. The two phone lines were all static, and we could place no calls, even to extensions within the hotel. We walked down to valet, requested our vehicle, then as we waited we decided to report the phone problem. We were assured that \"someone from engineering\" would enter our room while we were out and repair the phone. We were then told that if the phones were not fixed to simply dial 4-4-4-4 from our room, to which we asked, \"But if the phones have not been fixed, how can we dial this number?\" We were assured again that the phones would be replaced within the hour. We waited over 20 minutes for our car to be pulled around, then left the property for about an hour and a half. Upon our return, still no phones. When we reported the issue again in the morning to front desk upon checking out, we were told there was \"no record\" of our prior request on file. That was frustrating!! Our second and thirs issues happened on the morning of checkout. Although we had the \"Please Do Not Disturb\" sign on our door, and Check-Out is not until NOON, Housekeeping started banging on our door at 8 a.m. We were not only jarred awake from sleep, but were forced out of bed to answer the door and tell them that we were not checking out for four more hours. At this point I would have most certainly complained to the front desk about this disturbance, however since we had no phones, this was not a simple task! My husband and I attempted to fall back asleep, when less than a half-hour later, impossibly LOUD fire alarms started going off all over the property, but most directly into our ear drums from right above the bed. The loud speaker then announced that a series of drills would be performed (at 8:45 a.m. on a Friday morning?!?). The alarms continued intermittently for about 45 minutes, each time just as incredibly loud and shocking to the system. We checked out of the hotel exhausted and anxious from the many nuisances and disturbances which had taken place during our stay. Our final issue came about as we were driving home and realized we had left something in our room. We phoned the hotel and were transferred to Housekeeping. The contact there informed us that Housekeeping does not take inventory of Lost and Found until later in the evening, and that we would be called if our item was found. Because I received no phone call, the next day I called back. Housekeeping had no record of our item, so I was transferred to Lost & Found. Our item was never turned in by the staff, which most probably means that it was taken. We take responsibility for leaving this item in our room, but most 4-Star Hotels employ staff that may be trusted to turn in items that are left behind. This was very discouraging, and certainly says something about the lack of training and low quality of staff that are employed at The Peabody. A star in the midst of all the dust- the Bellhop ( I believe his name was Adolfo- cursing myself now for not writing it down!). He greeted us by name each time we would enter the hotel, was very knowledgeable, had pride in his work, and should be commended for his excellent work ethic and what he gives to his position and to the hotel. My suggestion for this hotel would be to look at other 4-Star Hotels such as the JW Marriott in order to study and learn from their systems and staff training.

When I called back the Monday before our arrival to confirm our reservation, again no one mentioned the construction. I did not learn of the construction until I went on this website, Tripadvisor.com, and read about it. On the Tuesday before our arrival, I received an e-mail with a different confirmation on it. I called to find out what had changed and was told they didn't have any adjoining rooms available but we would be upgraded to a suite at no extra charge. (This turned out not to be any great upgrade). I inquired about the construction and was told that \"it was not noisy. They were just moving in beds and putting in final fixtures.\" The person I spoke to also told me she would request a \"quiet room\" for our stay. I was also told the construction was only going on Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Upon our arrival and after a 7 hour flight, when we checked in, the front desk wanted us to sign for the $15.98 a day \"Service Fee\" for 3 rooms. The \"suite\" consisted of 2 rooms with a palor in the middle. The services were for items we weren't even going to use: Wireless Internet (we brought our own), local and long distance use of the telephone (we had our own cell phones to use), 2 bottles of Peabody water (we bought a 6 pack at Walgreens for $3.79), I-Ride tickets (we purchased 3 - 1 all day pass for $12.00 and we didn't even end up using them), use of the fitness center (we never used it), and shoe shining (we were wearing tennis shoes and didn't need shoe shining). We were told at check-in that this \"Service Fee\" was \"automatic\". After much complaining, they finally waived the \"Service Fee\". We awoke on Saturday morning to construction noise and on Sunday morning we were awaken to jackhammering and construction noise at 7:45 a.m. We complained at the front desk and were told they would change our room. I also mentioned that I was told the construction was only Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and the front desk told me that the construction was 7 days a week as they were trying to finish the hotel for the upcoming convention season. When we arrived back at the hotel later in the day, they had changed our room to one on a higher floor when we complained that we were still on the side of the hotel where the new tower was being built, we were told it didn't matter where in the hotel you were, you were going to get construction noise because they were now doing work in the main hotel. Our new room was just as bad as the previous room. Little did we know that there were some brand new rooms in the hotel but we didn't get any of them. We found out when our friends arrived to spend a few days and they had been given new updated rooms. Our rooms had old furniture that had nicks in them, old drapes and old dirty looking carpets. When we complained again, after spending a lot of money to stay at this hotel for 9 days, they refunded us 2 days for 1 of the rooms we booked. We also had to endure 2 power outages, 1 in the middle of the night and one beginning at 4:00 a.m. and going on and off until 11:00 a.m. The person I spoke with in Reservations should have been honest about the construction and the \"Service Fee' when I made my initial reservation or at least when I called to confirm my reservation.

We were welcomed by a wonderful check-in agent (Stephanie I think) and a new starter who were both welcoming and friendly. I had called in advance to check that we could leave luggage in the reception as I knew we would arrive before 3pm. However, upon our arrival at noon, our room was ready. We appreciated the I-ride vouchers although we didn't use them everyday. The hotel location was great for the restaurants and bars on International Drive and is a short walk to Pointe Orlando. Our room was a newly renovated one on the tenth floor. It was a good sized room with a really comfortable bed, good sized bathroom and a view of the pool. The location of the room meant that it was quite dark. The motion sensor lights saved me a couple of bruises walking around in the dark and my husband loved the TV in the bathroom mirror. Our room was cleaned to a very high standard every day and whenever we saw housekeeping in the corridors, they were always friendly and polite. The pool area was well maintained with plenty of space for everyone and the pool itself was lovely and warm and there were plenty of towels easily available. We used the concierge just once to ask for directions and again Candi was very friendly and as well as offering the directions we needed, she suggested different methods and prices for getting there. The only downside we experienced with the staff was one day when waiting for a taxi, we were not assisted by the doorman so proceeded to get into a waiting taxi without their help which was fine by us but made the taxi driver uncomfortable as it was not the way to do things. I cannot say that we were ignored by the doorman, I think there was a coach full of people arriving at the same time so they were busy. We followed the same steps when getting a taxi to the airport and were helped by both a doorman and a bellboy. We also ate at the Capriccio Grill on the first night. I made my reservation on the same day and the assistant who made the reservation was fabulous (I can't think of her name but she was happy and friendly even addressing me by name when we returned at 8.30 for dinner). Our server, Maryann was excellent - she talked us through the whole menu, giving her personal favourites and recommending some sides (including advising us to share!). Lastly, we had a problem when we left the hotel in that we discovered when we arrived in Washington that we had left some things behind at the hotel. I called lost and found who were very quick to offer assistance - our belongings had already been found and they were waiting for some instruction from us. We were only in Washington for a couple of days so waited until we were in New York to arrange the onward delivery to our hotel there. I called lost and found again and provided the details and was told delivery would be by the end of the week. Unfortunately, that did not happen. However, I contacted the Peabody again when we returned to Europe and Maryellen in reception and Glenda in lost and found were both very efficient and fast to solve the problem.

On the second afternoon, I called the front desk and was told a manager would call me, this never happened. The next morning, while getting ready, the alarm sounded again! My other problem was the unpredictability of the maid service. On those days that I attempted to nap, the housekeepers didn't come until around 3 (while I was trying to nap).

We had flown from the West Coast to Orlando to attend the national Elks convention and arrived three days early, staying in a one-bedroom suite hotel near the Orlando airport. Did Disney and Kennedy Space Center for three days and packed up the rental car to move to The Peabody for the convention. Returned the rental car to Payless, hopped into a cab and arrived at The Peabody to find my bag was missing. Hubby thought I had it, he thought I had it......you know how that goes. Telephoned Noel, the Town Car driver, who happened to be returning to the airport area, and asked him if we'd left the bag in his car. \"No,\" he said, but he would be happy to stop by Payless and see if they had it. Called the suites hotel and Payless no fewer than four times each that day and, of course, no luck in finding it. Totally upset and depressed, I stopped by The Peabody concierge desk and they were very sympathethic, giving me the telephone number for the Orlando Police Department so that I might file a crime report. They also directed me to the nearest mall so that I could buy makeup and other essentials. I didn't have so much as a toothbrush! Our room at The Peabody was not a remodeled one but was clean, offered a very comfortable bed and met our needs, as we were rarely in it. The woman who cleaned our room each day was especially good, friendly and we tipped her well. The pool area is nice and large and offered a respite from the busy days of the convention. Staying a week, we were able to try out the restaurants within the hotel and within walking distance, as well as room service, which was always good and arrived within a half hour of our order.

I have called Orlando \"home\" since 1986. While the military has allowed me to travel all over the world, and the ability of staying in some of the best hotels, I have always regarded the Peabody to be one of the best hotels in Orlando. After staying there the first weekend of April, I am highly unimpressed. What they do right: SERVICE, SERVICE, SERVICE! Everything from the great front desk service to Al the bellman, to Hercules the gentleman by the pool. In my opinion, these people were saving grace for the Peabody. I felt that they showed genuine concern for customer satisfaction, not that it was just a job. The only exception to this rule, and I think it's the standard with most of the hotels now in Orlando was the Valet. Whether it's the upscale, arts hotel, or the luxury, chain hotel downtown Orlando, or the Peabody, the Valet service seems very cattle rustler like. Get in, get out, no customer connection. I will say that they \"arts\" hotel probably does the best out of all that I have experienced in Orlando. The other thing that shines at this hotel, are amenities. Check out the HUGE pool or the fitness center. The equipment is a little dated, but still effective. Which leads to the bad... What could be done better: While there is ongoing construction for the new tower, the original hotel is VERY outdated and stale. When we first walked in the room, the first impression that we both had, was \"La Quinta\" until we noticed that the tv was still a glass tube vice a LCD/Plasma screen, but a lot of stations were included. The furniture and carpets are very worn and the standard rooms are very small. Self parking is about $12 and Valet about $20. I understand the prices, because of the Convention center right across the street, but I would imagine that hotel guests, should be able to get either validation or a reduction. We went with the valet, mainly for the reason that the self parking looked like it was at the other end of I-Drive the way some people looked walking. Now the AWFUL: We arrived around 4(our fault, running late). My childhood friend was getting married that evening at 530. I thought plenty of time to grab a quick shower and be there. Boy was I wrong. It took an hour and seventeen minutes to get a ready room. Which is shocking for a 4 star to have 1) such long room turnover and 2) for ANY hotel to be holding on rooms an hour after check in time. It was almost 530 by the time we got to our room. When we got there, there were clumps of hair still in the shower, and stains on the sheets on the bed. I went back down, and was given an immediate upgrade to another room, but by the time we got in that one, it was after 6. A full TWO HOURS after we checked in. UNSAT! Full disclosure: We could have immediately checked in if we wanted to be in a \"smoking\" room. Peabody, please tell your staff, to not suggest someone a SR with the caveat, \"that doesn't mean they HAVE smoked in it, just that they CAN.\" First a non-smoker will smell it and be affected by it, no matter how long ago it was, and two, if the floor is smoking, then it doesn't matter what the room is. that's why many hotels are now smokefree. While my situation may not have been typical, I feel the way that it was handled, was. Overall I would still recommend the Peabody, because there are more hits than misses, but when it misses, IT MISSES...in style. Those two hours really put a sever damper on our weekend. That had nothing to do with any individual person as much as it had to do with the organization of the hotel as a whole. I would stay at the Peabody again, but I feel that next time I will consider one of the Rosen properties first", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cGood stay, price a little high\u201d", "Author": "KrysyGT", "ReviewID": "UR60424721", "Content": "Great stay at the Peabody, not sure I would want to pay the full price rate for a stay outside of business purposes.

We also appreciated the bathrobes, daily bottles of water, and nightly turn-down service. We stayed on one of the club level floors with access to the lounge where continental breakfast, hors d\u2019oeuvres, cookies, and drinks were served throughout the day. Every time we had the opportunity to, we took advantage of and enjoyed the yummy continental breakfast. We also had access to the well-equipped fitness center which my husband enjoyed thoroughly. Also, during our stay...we had an excellent dinner at Capriccio and several good meals at the B-Line Diner. We took advantage of the complimentary I-Trolley passes and used them at least once a day to get around Orlando. And, we were able to catch the duck march a few times. Very cute! (So cute that I had to purchase a duck toy from the gift shop for our baby boy. It became his favorite toy on the airplane home!)

This was great because I could run back to the hotel for lunch since trade show food offerings are less than desirable, as well as dump things I'd picked up in the morning out of my bag to make more room for the afternoon. Also convenient was the beautiful, sunny, spacious lobby where I could meet up with friends & colleagues at day's end. I highly recommend the hummus as a snack while sipping. A fun bonus was getting to watch the famous Peabody ducks that are in the lobby fountain all day do their red carpet waddle as they returned via their own elevator to their penthouse pond suite. I dined in the restaurant Capriccio both nights of my stay. It was excellent and reasonable overall. I had breakfast in the B-Line Diner and found it to be good as well (I would, however skip the oatmeal). At the entrance to the B-Line diner there is a handy take-away counter where you can grab pre-made sandwiches, snacks & drinks. There is a good pool-side grille also. I hadn't stayed in this hotel for a few years and recalled the rooms being much nicer. Maybe it was my room (#767), maybe it was that I've stayed in some even nicer places since, but as nice as the rooms are, I felt mine was a little tired and likely in need of an update in the next year or so. The halls smelled a little old too. Here's what I liked about the room: The bed was comfy with a down comforter under the sheet for extra cushy feeling. I liked that they offer you the option to not have your linens changed every day and to reuse your towels if you wish in order to help save resources. NY Times outside the door each morning. Fairly well-stocked mini bar (just in case :-). Despite the fact that there was a dry cleaning box & chlid's ball under the TV cabinet when I checked in, the room was clean. Here's what I didn't care for so much: No magnifying mirror in the bathroom. You have to expect some noise from other rooms, but the plumbing from the other rooms was excessively loud. There was a TV on the bathroom counter taking up precious space. (I realize some may find this a plus; I'd rather have a magnifying mirror). I had received a good rate through the convention I was attending and was told that a variety of services would not be available to me with this rate unless I wanted to pay for them - I don't recall what all they were because I didn't really care about any of them, but I recall Internet Access, International Drive shuttle, gym access, morning lobby coffee being on the list with a few others. Nobody stopped me from getting a cup of coffee in the lobby :-) which was good since there is no coffee making equipment in the room. I was also charged $20+ tax per night to valet my car which I felt was a little excessive. I could have self-parked, but it was quite a hike, it was very hot, so I gave in and valeted. Service throughout the hotel staff was excellent. I discovered rather late in the evening on the first night that my TV remote did not work. It was late and I didn't want to deal with calling down to get it fixed, so I called the front desk and reported it the following morning. When I returned to the hotel later that day it was fixed and there was a message on my room phone telling me it had been done. I would stay here again if I had a convention to attend or a special event at the Peabody itself.

The carpet has stains and it is fraying against the wall. The room is in need of renovation because the wear and tear is not acceptable for what this hotel normally charges a night and defiantly not for its stature. The bathroom has a nice granite countertop with a t.v. The bathroom was clean but, I found several stray hairs. The tile around the bathtub is also starting to grow mold. The bed is very comfortable with lots of pillows. I received a rate of $87 on hotwire. Honestly the hotel is worth $87 but, not more. The hotel charges an extra $15 a night for a hotel service fee. All that is included in this fee is 800 calls, internet access, shoe shine, coffee in the lobby in the morning, two bottles of water, trolley tickets, and access to their fitness center. The average person will never use any of the above except for the bottled water. Their website states that the room was supposed to have a refrigerator and microwave in it which it does have a refrigerator however; it is only for its mini bar. Their website doesn\u2019t mention this but, to have a refrigerator and microwave for you to use it is an extra $15 a night a piece. Then you have to either pay $20 for valet parking or $12 to pay in a parking garage. After taxes along with the parking and hotel fees it is almost $150 a night. If you need a refrigerator and microwave it will be almost $200 a night. Most hotels in Orlando offer all the above for free with lower rates and also have very nice rooms.

Nothing to complain about except perhaps that the public rooms in the hotel and the restaurants were freezing = warm clothes required. Lots of people complaining about the $20 parking fee. We left our car in the car park at Pointe Orlando. Only a 10 min walk away and faster and cheaper than the valet.

We (seven co-workers and I) were there for business and were pleased that our conference was directly across the street from the hotel.

Everyone greeted us with a smile and each person was quick to offer their help. Each time I exited or entered the building, in fact, the valet people and bell hops were friendly and helpful. I was very impressed with them. I was also pleased with the services offered by the concierge. We needed their help on several occasions to get directions to attractions and advice on different modes of transportation. They were always friendly and helpful. The rooms at the Peabody are beautiful and well-appointed. The bed was the best hotel bed I can ever recall sleeping in. The room was spacious enough for the three of us ladies to get ready in the morning without crowding each other. Of course, we loved the LCD tv in the bathroom, too! We ate at the B-Line Diner twice for lunch during our stay. I highly recommend the chicken caeser salad and chicken noodle soup. Both were absolutely delicious! Everyone at my table enjoyed their food on both occasions. The service was not as good in the diner as it was in the rest of the hotel, though. But it didn't stop us from returning. My biggest complaint about my stay at the Peabody is the parking situation. I understand that they are undergoing major renovations, but that is not the fault of the traveler. I believe much better accommodations should be made for people who bring cars. Currently, you have two options. A) Allow valet to park your car and pay $20 per day or B) Park your car at an off-site parking garage and ride a shuttle bus back to the hotel for $12 per day. It seems very unreasonable to me to charge such a high amount when the hotel is inconveniencing its customers. I was not happy about this at all. However, the valet people and shuttle bus drivers were always very helpful and friendly and we never tipped. In fact, the first day I was there the bell hop told me that they do not work for tips...I'm not sure if he was being honest or just trying be nice, but I believed him! It took about 20 minutes for us to get the car back from the valet and about 15 minutes to get to the parking garage and back on the shuttle. We never had to wait for a shuttle. We did see construction going on, but never heard it. We were not disturbed by the construction other than having to deal with the frustrating parking situation.

I usually hate large hotels, but I loved this one. It was charming and classy. In fact, it made me think about movie stars who live in hotels--this would be a good candidate for a prolonged sojourn. I was able to see the duck parade on three occasions, and it was great fun. The staff were amazing--very rarely do you encounter such consistently high quality people and service. The food was exceptional at their bristo style restaurant, as was the service. It was also fun watching the chefs--I ate there three times. The diner breakfasts were delicious--they actually know how to poach an egg which is a good indicator of the quality of the chefs. The room was nice, lots of space and well organized. The bed was extremely comfortable. I liked the fact you could put a card on the bed to save them changing the linens daily. The recreation level with the pool was fun, and I had lunch out there one day. The bar around the fountain allowed for interesting people watching and meeting colleagues in a pleasant environment. So, all in all, I can't find anything negative to say about this place, and given how much I travel, that is in itself quite amazing. Regarding the additional charge, I declined it because I didn't have a car or a computer with me (I used the business center instead). I used the two bottles of water daily and was not charged. I did not think the hotel rates were bad (although the local taxes are) compared to Europe for example where you would get much less for much more. So I guess it all depends on your perspective. I went over to Winter Park one day to the Morse Museum which was a real treat and walked around that neighbourhood.

The room is a standard issue hotel room with no upgrades a 5-star would merit. The furniture, tv and armoire are average late 90s and the bathtub needs an overhaul - and that small tv in the bathroom BEHIND the toilet?? For business travel, I expected at least a small fridge and en-suite coffee maker, but neither was available. I asked that the mini-bar be emptied and they would not do that so an additional fee for a small fridge had to be paid (families should keep that in mind if you need to keep food or beverages chilled for children). I asked that a small coffee maker be brought to my room and they would not do that for 'hygienic' purposes. The DAILY additional fee of $15.00 covered my .50 newspaper, $2.00 worth of water, i-train passes (which cost $1.25 per ride) and very weak coffee that I had to trek to the lobby to get for myself. The gym is off-limits unless you pay AN ADDITIONAL $10.00 DAILY and the fridge will be delivered to your room for another DAILY charge of $10 or $15. So add about $50.00 per night to the already high per night fee to get the basics that are already offered in other hotels as part of the per night cost. The hotel staff I dealt with was nice enough and professional, and the lobby and pool areas were certainly clean enough. The location is convenient to the strip given it is not smack in the middle but only a walk away and still quiet enough. And a short drive or bus-ride away from the major attractions. So it is obvious that my main gripe are the additional fees that are not necessary when the basic room tarif is high to begin with at an establishment that is not yet upgraded but cites itself an almost 5-star.

Perhaps my expectations were too high... First, the primary complaint - the daily fee. The fee is supposed to cover internet access (Hello! This is the 21st century and even low budget hotels now offer free Wi-Fi!) and valet parking which is an unfortunate neccesity. At first it may seem posh to have to use valet services, but it quickly grows old as you have to plan your every move in advance because you really need to call for your car before you wait 10 minutes to receive it. Construction was being done on the hotel so self-parking is not really an option unless you want a LONG walk, and also note that their 24 hour diner is closed for renovations too. This hotel really seems geared more toward a business traveler who just has the company pick up the tab for all the little extra expenses, but as a vacationer, it would not be my first pick again. Don't even get me started on the Business Center and how much they wanted to charge for printing. Total rip off. To boot, we thought we were getting a really nice room for what we spent, but ther only thing that distinguished the place at all from a clean room at the La Quinta was that they had a TV behind the toilet. It would be a nice amenity if the tub was big and nice enough for a bath, but unless you are a man, it's hard to really see it - if you get what I mean. We also ordered a Pizza from room service late at night. It had just passed the time for the regular kitchen to make it, so we ended up with their different late night Pizza options. To be honest, I've had better pizzas from the freezer section at the grocer, and for the price and time it took for it all, I wouldn't do it again - not that I'll return to the hotel. To be fair, the room itself was very clean and had some cute duck details like the doorstop and duck shaped guest soap. The bed was large and comfy. You could tell it was a higher quality accomodation, it's just that my expectations were for much more considering the price. The staff - especially the valets - were always more than friendly, and it was fun to watch the ducks swim in the fountain in the lobby.

We didn't have any bad experiences, the pool was lovely and warm, the bar staff were particularly friendly, and they even offered us a late check out at no extra cost. To top it off, the Peabody ducks were an unusual attraction, definately worth viewing their arrival and departure during your stay. One thing that guests should note is the tax of $10.65 a day that is payable to the hotel upon departure, for which you get free I Trolley passes, a couple of bottles of water in your room a day and a few other things.

After paying $24 for one days internet access the previous week in the Westin Cancun, $10 seems reasonable.

Facility is very nice. Rooms are nice sized as are the bathrooms. Closets are very small, but there is an in-room safe.

This covers 2 bottles of water per day in the room, towels at the pool, and Wi-Fi. The charge is not that bad, but the Wi-Fi did not work the last couple days and calls to tech support were politely handled, but the sense of urgency in resolving the connection issue encountered was less than adequate. While not expecting 1 hour turnaround, it is not unreasonable to hear something in 3 - 5 hours. Waited almost 15 hours to hear the matter was \"resolved\". When login was attempted, the problem with access still existed. The restaurants are OK in the hotel, but are expensive. The gift shop is small and stocked at a fair level. Best bet is to go north on International Blvd and pick up what you need plus there is a nice assortment of restaurants for all budgets. Note: the hotel is under construction. The building stayed in is not affected - yet, but the immediate surrounding areas were being prepped with sewer and water lines during our stay and could be heard throughout the day. They are in the process of constructing a massive new tower scheduled for completion in the Fall of 2010. A model of the expansion is on the Recreation Level outside the Tennis Pro Shop. With the construction, their parking is gone. If you drive there or rent a car like we did, one will need to drop off their passengers and then drive about 3 blocks away to the deck in the Pointe Orlando Mall and then get shuttled back via bus. If one wishes to go to one of the many attractions in Orlando, the driver will need to reverse the process. You get the privilege of paying $6/dayfor this incovenience. You do receive a card that allows you unlimited in and out of the garage during your stay. The signage is decent to get you to where you need to go to pick up a shuttle bus. If there is any consolation, this \"fun\" is spread to all The Peabody Orlando employees as well as their guests that choose to self park. Needless to say, this process gets old fast. Valet parking is available, if you wish to pay for it and there are plenty of taxis as well. Fun note: the ducks attract sizeable crowds at 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. It's pretty interesting to watch the 4 ducks (1 drake and 4 hens) make their way from the fountain in the lobby bar to their \"palace\" on the Recreation Level. If you have young ones (5 - 10 years), you can have them act as an \"honorary duckmaster\" for one of the ceremonies. My son (9 yrs old) got to do it and pretty much \"ran the show\" (the ducks are so conditioned to the routine there is very little for the honorary duckmaster to do). You sign up at the Concierge Desk and there is no charge to you.

We were charged a $10 per night resort (service fee) for wireless and pool access, 2 bottles of water and I-trolley vouchers. To add insult to injury, we were also taxed on the $10 per day fee! 2. No shuttle service to the theme parks so we spent alot of money on Mears shuttle service. Expect to pay $10 RT per person to Disney parks and $14 RT per person to Universal Orlando/IOA. 3.

Great, I always valet anyways, so we handed the key and waited for him to give us our valet ticket. He didn't. Instead, he ran off with our key and yelled to us about finding him after we check in. Very strange and unprofessional. My husband and I were worried someone would steal the car, so he stayed by it until I checked us in. When we went up to the valet stand, they told us they didn\u2019t have our key and blew us off. It was awful. I was in tears over the messy situation. About an hour later, someone finally was able to locate our key and parked our car...for $18 dollars. That really should have been waived for our ordeal. We went inside, un-packed and changed clothes to go out to a nice dinner. We had reservations at Vito\u2019s, my husband\u2019s favorite. We asked the concierge to call us a cab, he was very rude and told us that there were too many cars out front (it was a valet disaster) and we could either walk to dinner or walk down the street to hail a cab ourselves. He also said that it was getting late and the only place probably open was Denny\u2019s or Friday\u2019s. Uh, it\u2019s like 10:00 on a Saturday night in Orlando\u2026.everything is open. A 4 star hotel concierge should know better. Needlessto say, we missed our dinner reservation because of the transportation nightmare. In the morning, it took almost 2 \u00bd hours to get our car out of the valet. Unorganized and unprofessional. Checking out, they charged us another $17.98 for some movie we didn't watch. I think we turned the weather channel on and that was it. The hotel is very pretty and clean but not worth the bad service.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cHow is this Valet service acceptable???\u201d", "Author": "JamaicaBRIDE08", "ReviewID": "UR16432474", "Content": "First of all, I want to start off by saying that this is a very beautiful hotel... My husband and I booked for priceline and got a good deal for a 4* hotel in the Orlando area. When we arrived, we were confused by the mayhem of the valet parking, as I had read ahead of time that self-parking was an option. Apparently there was construction going on, so 100% of the cars had to be valet'd for 18/day plus tax. This wasn't the end of the world, but we hate to waste money on something as simple as walking to your car. We arrived at 3:15 (checkin is at 3) and were told that there would be a slight delay and they would call our cell phone when the room was ready. No problem, we'll check the property out. The hotel was kind of a zoo because there was a big modeling \"workshop/casting\" going on and kids were all over the place. It wasn't what we had in mind, but at the end of the day, it was great people watching. We waited in the lobby area and had a few drinks, watched the ducks march, etc. Around 6pm (3 hours after check-in time), we got the call that our room was ready. Room was nice and pretty much like the pictures posted on this site. THEN, we went down about 6:25 to get our car from valet. We had previously made reservations at 7pm at a place that was literally 5minutes drive away. After waiting 1/2 hour and no sign of our car, I rescheduled our reservations for 7:30. We didn't make it until 7:45! It took about an hour to get our car, which was apparently good compared to the 2-3 hour waits described in another review. Next day, we reserved a cabana at the pool for $75/day. Good deal for shade/chairs/towels/beverages, but the wireless wasn't working and our tv didn't go to ESPN which was a disappointment for my husband. All in all, that was a great deal for a cabana. By the way, we left our sunglasses in the car the day before, so decided to buy new ones at the gift shop rather than deal with the chaos of valet...we kind of felt trapped! All in all, it was a good stay. If we had paid full price, we would have been much more irritated with valet. At the end of the day, we probably wouldn't stay there again due to parking situation, which is a shame because it's a very nice hotel in a great location.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cValet parking nightmare!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "trip46", "ReviewID": "UR16409329", "Content": "We stayed from May 23- 25, and while it is a beautiful property, the parking situation is out of control.

I can honestly say this is one of the WORST hotel stays I have ever had, The once fantastic Peabody Orlando has gone to hell. Its a shame really - because in its day it used to be one of the best. 2008 is a different story for the Peabody. The 20 something year old hotel is showing its age. The rooms are dated, my faucet leaked, the carpet was frayed and torn, the wallpaper in the bathroom was stained , the grout in the tub is dark and moldy. The place needs some major remodeling and attention to bring it back to the standards they claim. Upon check in I was checked in to room 2147. Within 1 minute of entering the room. I went to use the bathroom. When I raised the lid. There was dried urine and fecal matter all over the seat. Looked like it had been there for over a day. It was disgusting. When I called downstairs to complain. The front desk manager was very arrogant about it and did not handle the situation with any class. She was so bold as to suggest that maybe I had done it. I was appalled !!! They finally changed me over to 2145 (next door and same housekeeper). They made me wait over 20 min for the new keys. It was not a pleasant experience. I went to use there spa facility. It is dated, tired, rundown, dirty, and also in need of attention. The shared Jacuzzi looks like it was installed in 1980 and has been painted so many times there are 2 inches in layers of paint. The tiles are cracked, moldy. stained, and in now way does this resemble the spa facility of a 4 star hotel. Furthermore about 30 min before closing. The employee on duty went inside the shower area, undressed, and showered in the guest area. This looks terrible and should not be allowed. I had lunch at the dinner. While the food I have to say was excellent. The facility is crying for help. It looks like a retro space age dinner that got stuck in 1983 in a time capsule and was never let out. The place is greasy. dirty. outdated, the blinds next to the window where my booth was where dusty and greasy. It needs to be torn down and redone. Even the menu I was handed was old, battered, and greasy to the touch ! But the worst part of the stay. Is the Valet service. The hotel is building a new tower right next door. (This is probably why they are investing \"0\" dollars into making the current tower nice for guests) The parking garage is torn down and gone. The only option for parking during the construction is valet. The charge is one of the highest in all of Orlando. Furthermore the wait times are INCREDIBLE. On the evening of May 24th. I waited 2 Hours and 28 Minutes for my car to come around. I missed my dinner show and lost the non refundable tickets. I was not the only person in this situation, It was so out of control. That guests called in the Orange County Police Dept for help. Out of desperation that the hotel was not bringing them there car. Hotel management handled the situation in a horrible manner. They ruined many peoples evenings and vacation. They showed a complete lack of respect for guests and in my thousands of nights in hotel room stays. Can tell you I have never seen this situation in a hotel ever. There where hundreds of people stranded without there vehicles because the Peabody Orlando refused to bring them there cars. I am a diabetic patient. I explained them that if they could not bring my vehicle. Could I at least walk to it, or have someone go to it to get my medication. The staff and management at the Peabody Orlando REFUSED to honor my request and made me wait 2 hours and 28 minutes to gain access to my vehicle and medication. The next morning. I waited again over 45 min for my vehicle to be delivered to me. The car was delivered full of mud and grime all over the carpets and exterior of the car. The vehicles are parked in a mud swamp. The hotel provides no mats or any safeguard to keep the cars clean. I will now have to pay to get my car detailed when I leave here and shampoo the carpets. I can see the swamp where the cars are from my window and its very muddy and dirty. After endless complaining. All I got was a valet refund and false promises that this would never happen again. That for the rest of my stay the car would remain on the ramp for my convenience. The truth is that never happened and the hotel, its staff, and management not once EVER kept any of there false promises to me. Furthermore I never received an \"Im sorry\" or \"I apologize\" from anyone here. Except one of the mangers \"Ms. Tara Tate\" whom I have to say was very polite and professional. But in the spirit of the Peabody Orlando, was full of lies and false promises. The actions of this hotel are shamefull. In some cases Ilegal (denying a guest with a chronic disease access to his medication for over 2 hours), and a disgrace to the Orlando hospitality industry. All I can do is hope that other guests will read this and re consider ever staying at this hotel. Specially if you plan to use your car. Id wait till after 2010 when the new tower is supposed to be ready. Maybe then they will care about there guests and the service. But for now.

After a very enjoyable stay, we left around 10:30 on Sunday morning. As we entered the lobby, it was obvious that there were problems outside. There were in the neighborhood of 100 people standing outside trying to get their cars from valet parking. The first employee we saw told us to get in the line to the valet window. Once there, we were told to go to the \"little black girl taking the list of valet parking ticket numbers.\" The guy behind us told us he'd already been there over an hour. The employee behind the glass, looking completely exhausted apologized and told us that 'they'd been taken off guard by the rain last night and were having to wash down every car before bringing it around and that they were going as fast as they could.\" I asked simply to give me my keys and that I'd walk around to the car myself. That request was refused, saying that they couldn't do so as they needed to make sure every ones car got out safely. Once on the list, I was told by the girl that we were looking at about a 1 1/2 hour wait for our car. Surely enough, it actually took 1 hour and 45 minutes for the car to come around. While waiting, (and the mood of the crowd was getting nasty), I ran into another couple who had already been waiting almost three hours. There was a hotel employee working with them to try to figure things out but when we left, they were still there waiting. We also ran into a guy who was upset because he'd been through the same issue the previous day - taking almost 2 hours to get his car out of valet. For those who needed to get to the airport, the hotel employees were offering to pay for taxi rides and for the hotel to take responsibility for getting their rental cars back to the correct place(s). (Yeah, right, I'm going to walk away from a rental car???) The most aggravating thing - even beyond the delay - was that there were no options. There is NO self-park and the valet park is $18 (PLUS tax) per night. So, for two nights, I paid over $38 (with tax) and asked for my car once. That one time took 1 hour 40 minutes. I was so glad to see my car finally pull up that I didn't even complain about the mud that coated the front quarter panels ... it'd obviously been parked in a grass or dirt lot!!!

UNFORTUNATELY, the hotel has inexplicably not applied the same level of quality to its parking service. The hotel has no self-parking facilities (it is currently beginning a massive expansion project, so the former parking lot is now a construction zone), and it has outsourced its valet parking service to an incompetent vendor.

Overall, the hotel definitely has the four-five star feel. I am extremely picky (I mean extremely) and it met my expectations for cleanliness - no easy feat. They accomodated my initial requests - high room, away from elevator, fridge in room, facing pool. It was clear they were professionals. That being said, there were some issues which bothered me. Let me start by saying that we had a GREAT rate for the room - via Bookit.com. At 99 dollars a night I really shouldn't be complaining, however.... The room was made up very late each day. We had to ask for our bottles of water each day - there is a mandatory 10 dollar per adult guest service fee which includes several things, including two bottles of water per day (and internet among other things). Not an awful thing, but it was kind of annoying to feel petty by having to call and ask for them - not once, but every day. The worst was the parking. I wasunder the impression there would be free self parking - mostly from comments on this site about the fact that the spaces where narrow. Well, I would have been happy with narrow spaces. Instead, there was no self parking and I was faced with an 18 dollar a day valet charge, plus tips each and every time I came and went from the hotel. Which would be tolerable, except that it was simply AWFUL. We had to wait at least 30 minutes on several occassions to get our car. And when we would call ahead from the room to have the car pulled around we were told that it was too busy so we would have to come down in person (if it wasn't so busy I wouldn't have minded coming down in person - that was exactly the point). I understand they couldn't have cars just sitting there, but even after I assured her I would be down in a few minutes, knowing they were backed up by about 20 - 30, they refused to do it. Additionally, every day I was told it would get better, that it was a new process, that the hotel was unusually full, etc. yet there was only one day when I did not have to wait a ridiculous amount of time. I have two small children and it was very disruptive to have to have these waits, but to have to pay so much for it on top of the terrible service was just insulting. Other than apologies, I only received one day's 18 dollar refund upon checkout. Also, the pool was closed for 3 out of 5 of my days there. i don't know if it was scheduled maintenance or not, but a big part of our plans included just relaxing by the pool. They did have an arrangement with a nearby hotel to use their pool, but you know it's just not the same as being able to run up to your room each time. Particularly as I have two small children who wouldn't have wanted to walk to the other hotel, and so the thought of having to get the car to drive there (see above) wasn't appealing. We ended up spending time near the kids pool - which was OK, but not the same. So I hate to complain, but it really bugged me that we had to pay for such a horrible service. I mentioned it to the checkout staff when I received my bill (and parking cost me about another night's worth of stay) and they refunded me one of the days of parking. Not a huge effort in my opinion. But if you are considering the hotel, and are picky about cleanliness and like a business-like feel, this is a great place. Also - the duck march was very cute.

We have stayed at many 5 star hotels and this was definitely a 5-star experience. The marching of the ducks was an added pleasure. The duckmaster was very kind, inclusive and informative.

The B-line diner was excellent! We ate dinner and breakfast there. There is a good children's menu and my sons enjoyed their french toast every morning. It was more than just a diner, there was definitely a chef back there as well as a first rate pastry chef. The pool was a highlight. It was nearly Olympic sized and was heated! There was a huge spa that was heated very nicely at around 103 degrees. Perfect! We also loved the complementary robes. The only downside to me was that we had to pay $18.00/ night for valet. We would have liked the choice to self-park but there was not a choice. In addition, upon your arrival they inform you of a $10.00/ night charge that you must pay.

We obtained the hotel on Priceline for the bargain rate of $85. We arrived at the hotel about 10:00 a.m. and our room understandably was not ready. We checked in and went to the outdoor mall next door. About 1:00 p.m., our room was ready and it was excellent. Duck soap, duck coffee stirrers, duck shampoo, and the most comfortable bed. We watched the daily duck march where the ducks are led into the fountain for food at 11:00 a.m. daily. My only complaint is the $10 service fee for water and internet. It should be included in the room. Okay, now for some Orlando travel duck tips: 1. You will get bombarded by toll booths on the way from the airport to the hotel. Have your change and dollar bills ready. 2. Who here likes a good deli? Too Jays on Dr. Phillips Blvd is the place to be with reasonable prices - packed with locals. Ask the hotel for directions - also a great breakfast away from the tourist traps - but just minutes away. I got a free mini black and white cookie at the end of the meal while my wife was using the facilities. 3. The outdoor mall next door charges $2/hr to park and is not that great at all. Take a quick drive to the outlets for some fantastic shopping and bargains. I bought a new pair of sunglasses as my wife made me throw out the $6 pair I bought at Rite Aid. Concerge will give you good directions to this shopping mecca. 4. The pool area is fantastic - enjoy a nice swim in the morning before it gets too crowded. Watch your little ducks as it gets deep in some parts. 5. No need to leave the hotel for a nice cocktail in the evening. Both the lobby bar and Mallards inside of the hotel are a great place to have a drink. 6. Parking is free which is a nice touch - I would highly recommend renting a car in Orlando. 7. Gift shop had some amazing deals 50% off some clothing. Stop in for a set of duck cookie cutters or a stuffed duck. 8. Restaurants inside the hotel appear expensive. I did check the menus and I am pleased to report there is no duck dishes. Okay, that is all the travel duck tips for now. Enjoy your stay!

I stayed at the Peabody from July 29 - August 2nd. First of all this was my first trip so I did not know what to expect. The check in was easy, and we proceeded to our room. The first problem we encountered was that we were not given the King Bed we had requested. We didn't complain and went right out to a theme park. Upon returning we encountered what seemed to be 400- 500 teenagers in the hallways, on the elevators and basically overunning everthing. I was tired and only had 2 hours sleep because of an early flight. I looked down to the pool. We counted 218 teenagers in the pool and over 50 teenagers, unsupervised, in the hottub sitting on each other(because there was no room) and acting crazy. I was 20 floors up and could hear the screaming and yelling for over an hour and could not sleep. I went to the pool and asked the one parent I saw what she thought about the 50 + boys and girls sitting on each other in a hot tub on a religious trip. Teens were ,seriously, riding up and down the elevator and calling it a party elevator as we tried to get on the elevator. I was unbelievably upset and it was ruining my trip and my stay. The teens and some parents would just continously shove you out of the way and you could wait 1/2 and hour to get on an elevator packed- end to end- with dripping wet screaming teens- coming from the pool. I showed the manager what was going on around midnight. We were upgraded to another room as the people in the last review said. The other room was awesome. I was very impressed with this room, but I can only imagine what it would cost, had not thousands of teens kept me up all night and taken the room had had been promised(I had even paid to upgrade to a king bed. The accomadations for the second room were second to none, but my original room was basic and not what I asked for. The Superior Room is no different from the Delux except for a little T.V. set and the fact you are moved a few floors higher. On a positive note, room sevice was good, we had a blow dryer and iron and ironing board. If you stay in the fron part of the hotel you can see both the disney fireworks and the Seaworld Fireworks simultaneosly at 10 p.m. There is also a 10$ daily charge that they will bill you for at the end of your stay for water and an I trolley pass. The internet is 10 $ more a day. It is close to Seaworld, Universal and Discovery Cove. Discovery Cove is awesome, but you can skip Seaworld and Island of Adventure. Universal is cool too- but you MUST have the express pass. The marching of the ducks is cute and be sure to take a duck soap for a souvenier. Again, I would definatey call ahead and ask what conventions are here because they will ruin your stay. The last day the teens had gone and we enjoyed a pianist and the marcing ducks.

The hotel is beautifully decorated, with ample and comfortable common areas and lovely rooms. The pool was large and had plenty of loungers. However, I was with my husband and children and there were very few families staying at the hotel, so there were no other children to play with at the pool (a plus for adults looking for peace and quiet, but overall the hotel is not geared to children). My kids were invited, however, to be duckmasters and lead the duck parade one day. Duck Master Dave was terrific and so kind to us. It was the highlight of the trip. My only complaint with this hotel is that there are no coffee makers in the rooms. You have to clean up to go downstairs and wait in a very long line to buy your $3 cup of coffee.

So I ventured away from SPG and gave the Peabody a try. I was quite happy I did! Check-in was fast and easy, which was pretty fortunate given we'd pulled up just as droves of conventioneers were doing the same. The Peabody's website has a rather odd (to me, at least) room reservation process - rather than check certain selections and such, you just write to them telling them what you want and trust they'll make it happen) and so I was a bit concerned I'd not get the kind of room I wanted or would but I could actually tell they paid close attention to all that and got us exactly what we wanted. We asked for a suite, which we got. And we asked for a smoking room - which they didn't have, but they did give us one of the few rooms with a balcony and so that was taken care of! The furniture was all in good shape and the rooms were decorated nicely. The bathroom itself was rather small, but there was a large vanity with dual sinks right outside the bathroom so that more than made up for it. Plenty of closet space, and there was also a wetbar, minibar, sitting area, dining table. There are quite a bit of dining options on property, and all of the ones we tried out were pretty good - including room service. We did get up early (hey, 10am is early for some of us! hehe) to see the Duck March. It lasts all of a few seconds but was pretty cute - who doesn't love ducks? Certainly, Orlando is a very family-oriented town and a lot of the hotels in and around the city cater to large familes for extended stays.

I live in Orlando, but love to 'get away' every once in awhile to a nice hotel.

Every request I've had has been met. Parking is free, unless you valet. You might expect a bit of a walk, especially if there is a big event going on in the convention hall. I usually drop my bags off at the valet and then self park. (if I have a companion to watch my bage, of course). There are several places to eat if you looking to just stay at the hotel. The B-line diner has good food, albet expensive for what it is. The kids meals are a good price, though. (Yes, 'expensive' is so subjective... so I guess it depends on your budget.) There are more than enough places to eat on International Drive - you can get a good recommendation from the concierge, or just hop in your car and explore. If you don't have a car, then you can take the I-drive trolley. But... I digress.... The pool is so nice - very large and well maintained. The hot tub is also large - very nice! There are lots of shaded chairs if you don't want to sun. The poolside service is my favorite indulgence. The burgers are really good (I don't usually eat burgers, but for some reason they taste better poolside)... and the drinks are tasty. I usually stay in the most economical (cheapest!) room available. The beds are so comfy, and and the bathrooms are clean and very elegant. The view can be nice (if you are up high, facing sea world or disney you can expect a fireworks show every night), or kind of plain (a low level room above the pool). I like the lobby - a grand piano is surrounded by small cocktail tables. You can sit and relax or order snacks/drinks while someone plays the piano.

The Peabody is listed as a 4 star hotel and I would say that is about right. The location of the hotel is excellent if you are going to Universal or Seaworld. It is on the quite end of I drive directly across the Orlando Convention Center. I wanted to be on this side of Orlando instead of staying at near Disney. I feel there are better restaurants and shops in this area compared to Lake Buena Vista. Check In- Check was easy. Pulled up and had the bellman take our bags. Nice feature of the hotel is free self parking. Most resorts in this area charge for self parking which is just an extra change and a waste of money if you ask me. Self parking is right next to the hotel and they have another \u201cmain\u201d entrance near all the self parking area. The hotel check in line was about 10 people long but moved quickly. Lots of families checking in with kids. Which kind of surprised me for this type of hotel. Because of all the people in line the hotel staff added extra people to speed up the process. I asked for an upgrade on the room as it was a special weekend for us. The clerk said she did have a nice room on the 17th floor facing Disney so we could see the fireworks at night. Hotel Lobby & Elevators- The hotel lobby is kind of chopped up. It is not a grand entrance like some of the reports type hotels in this area. But more sectioned off in different areas. The bellman grabbed our bag cart and we headed up to the room. The ducks were just making their match out from the center pond so the center area was packed with people. How can you tell when you are staying in nice hotel, the speed of the elevators! The elevators at the Peabody FLY. Our room was on the 17th floor and they moved us up there in seconds. We never had to wait for more then a couple of seconds for elevators the whole time we were there. Nice! Room- Our room was 1760 which was facing Disney and the Orlando Convention Center. Below us was the pool. The room it self was shaped weird. It was not your standard square box but more of a U shape. The entrance of the room had the bathroom on the right side and the king bed on the other side of the U. Windows went all across the facing the pool. Lots of natural light! At first I did not like the shape of the room but after a while it was great to open your door and not see your bed. Bathroom was very nice and even had a little TV in there. Bed was great. One of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on. TV was standard TV not a flat screen. Everything worked great and was in good condition. $10 a day report fee. Yes, they charge it. You get 2 bottles of water with it, free I drive trolly tickets. We takes cabs so did not use the I drive trolly. The water was nice to have each day but I would rather not be charged the $10.00. But what are you going to do. They do give you free shoe shine service! Which I did take advantage of. Overall Comments \u2013 Hotel staff was very nice. Everyone went out of the way to make you feel welcome. Room service was quick and not as pricey as other hotels. Never went to the pool are because it was to cold. Point Orlando is a complex next door that is being fixed up. New places are going in and when it is done it will be a great place to hang out. It is walking distance from the hotel right around the corner. The hotel is a 4 star hotel. Not a resort. It lacks the big grounds most reports have and large pool areas. But the location is in the middle of everything and is very easy to get to I-4. We got a special rate at the hotel for $95.00 a night and I think it was worth it.

The first problem we encountered was checking-in: We arrived at around 4pm and were told by the valet staff there was a short line to check in. Unfortunately this turned out to be a very long line, made up mainly of delegates checking in for a conference at the nearby conference center. After 15 minutes of standing in line my husband went to the bar area & sat down so that he could keep an eye on our luggage which had just been abandoned on a trolley in the reception area. I continued to queue and it took about 45 minutes to get to the reception desk. There was a full quota of reception staff on, an apology was offered for the delay but I felt it would have been better if one receptionist could have dealt with non-conference check-ins. There was another long delay to get the bags brought up to the room. The room was adequate, quite spacious and clean, windows could have done with being cleaned. Good view over Orlando area.

Yes, I can see why people get aggravated over that mandatory $8.00/day charge for things you may not want -- a charge you don't hear about until you've pretty much checked in already -- and they really should do away with that. Otherwise, though, I didn't see the problems others have experienced. My room was clean, quiet, and very comfortable. It was adjacent to the elevator, and I heard the occasion \"ding\", but not enough to really matter. I heard one group of people being loud as they passed my room around midnight, but that's just thoughtlessness on their part, not the hotel's fault. Otherwise I never heard a peep out of anyone.

I couldn't order anything until around 1:00 a.m., but it was no problem. The bathroom is not opulent by any means, but it was clean and modern; it's not done in a Ritz-Carlton style or anything, but there was nothing about it to find fault with, either. It does have a small flat-panel TV on the counter. I didn't find much use for it, but I guess some people might enjoy it. The hotel is located on Int'l Drive, where the traffic can sometimes make you think you're in Manhattan, but if you're not driving or getting out much, it shouldn't be a big issue. If you are, just be prepared to be patient and leave extra time. The lobby area was very nice and clean and bright, with lots of people hanging out and appearing to enjoy themselves. There was one spot on the edge of the fountain where one of the ducks had left his/her ... um, 'calling card', but it didn't strike me as appearing dirty or gross, on the whole. I really noticed it only because I had read comments about that on this site. I'd call the Peabody a very solid 4-star hotel.

They have wireless everywhere which you pay as part of the resort fee. The pools and the Jacuzzi were very good. Make sure you go into the spa.

Obviously you have to pay for any beauty treatments, or massage. The only snag I had with them is that Valet parking is $14, if you don't want to pay park yourself the car park is only a few steps away.

It took the on duty manager, Elliot, 40 minutes and 2 phone calls from me to get us a new room. Extremely little apology was offered. We were moved from 1033 to 1069. We should have been given a free upgrade or discount or something for our trouble, but we just received a room in even shabbier condition than the first. This room had a dead lizard on the floor and the TV in the bathroom didn\u2019t work. We didn\u2019t bother complaining about the new room, as it was time to get ready to go out and we didn\u2019t think complaining would accomplish anything. No one seemed to care about our comfort.

Many of the folks on business were very friendly to us - a few mentioned how they wished their children were with them. I actually don't mind convention hotels as they usually have great restaurants and good service. The staff at the hotel was outstanding. My kids (as well as many adults) loved the Duck March. What a crowd. The Ring Master acknowledged my children which they enjoyed. We ate at the B-Line Diner twice for Breakfast - good food & we lucked out with an incredible Server. We dined at the Capriccio Grill and had one of the best steak dinners ever. Again, we had an amazing Server. Location was close to both Disney & Universal. There are also many things to see & do on International Drive if you have the time. Self-parking at the hotel is free (nice perk). We knew about the resort fee which we had to pay for two rooms.

The new room on the 16th floor had a smoky smell to it even though I specifically asked for a non-smoking room due to health reasons. It was also much smaller than the previous room and had a seedy feel to it. We also had to call and request that the bottles of water (which we paid a hotel fee for) be placed in our room since housekeeping forgot to do so. Luckily we were out most of the time.

We arrived with lots of stress on our backs and came back home refreshed after just one day! The Peabody had a convenient location; especially if we had wanted to go to Sea World (we passed it by in our way back from dinner). I booked the hotel the night before our arrival on priceline.com for $100 which came out to a total of $124 with taxes. The infamous service charge is true: $8 for two bottles of water, wireless internet connection, and unlimited local and 800-number calls. The problem is that when checking in they don't make a point to clarify whether this is a mandatory charge or only chargeable if you are planning to use the services mentioned. The lobby is exquisite and it gives you a glimpse of what is about to come. As soon as you enter, the attentive but unobtrusive staff makes sure you feel welcomed. We arrived at 1:00 p.m., two hours earlier than expected and requested an early check-in, which was granted without any hesitation. The ladies at the front desk were extremely helpful and professional. Our room was on the sixth floor. We were very pleasantly surprised that it was enormous! It had a round table with four chairs, a sofa, center table, end table, two chairs, a bar with three stools, a beautiful armoire (which hid the flat screen TV), and a king bed. Even though our view was pitiful (heliport), we did not mind exchanging that for the spacious, clean, and well-tended room that we received. Restroom had all the expected ammenities and was extremely clean, as well. After dinner on Saturday (which we ate outside the hotel), there was free live entertainment (a pianist, bass player, and violinist) in a very inviting area of the lobby, close to the bar. They were so good that we stayed there for three hours, until they played te last song at midnight. The drink prices are a bit high, but what you would expect at this type of venues(we paid a total of $24 for a pina colada and a chocolate martini; and then $4 for a soda). We spent Sunday in the pool which was heated to what I would say were a very comfortable 80 degrees. You could rent their cabanas and well-padded lounge chairs or just use the basic chairs without charge (plenty of choices among sunny or shaded areas).

This was my worst hotel experience EVER. My colleague brought her reservation confirmation sheet with her and was told during the check-in process that they did not have a record of her reservation and she would need to find a room elsewhere. Because there were several conferences in town, there were no nearby rooms. So, she ended up having to stay with me. Strike one. Strike two-- our room was dirty. There were cup rings and large coffee drops on the marble counter, there was lipstick on the lampshade (the side facing the room), a large piece of ribbon was pushed under the entertainment cabinet rather than actually being vacuumed up when housekeeping came in the next day. Housekeep actually entered our room (while we were in it) without knocking first! I often say at five-star hotels and the cleanliness of this room was not at all acceptable. Strike three-- the wireless never wokred after 6:00 p.m., was always slow, and cost $7.00 a day for connectivity for one laptop. You had to pay an additional fee for a second laptop. I do feel lucky to have been given a room upon my arrival. Two colleagues who arrived at the same time had to wait for over two hours to be assigned a room. And we arrived at about 5:00 p.m. Numerous others at the conference told stories about not having a room, having to vacate their room before their reservation was over. No one had success with the wireless access. Everything is a $13 cab ride, except for the airport which is about $35.00, from this hotel. The hotel is close to nothing except the convention center. I phoned the hotel to discuss my stay and spoke to the front office director. The director said all the right things, but as it turns out, talk is cheap. On a memo dated June 3rd (for my October stay!), I was told I would receive a refund of 20% of my stay-- a total of $140.63-- issued to the credit card on file. Being as this trip was being reimbursed by my employer, this was not even a close to an acceptable resolution. To his credit, I requested, and was given, a reversal of the refund (writing a $140 check to my employer was not something I was interested in doing). For a hotel selling itself on wonderful service, my experience was the opposite... from the first impression of a dirty room to an apology memo dated months BEFORE my stay.

My birthday is Oct 30, and we were married the morning of Oct 31st. We informed the front desk of these two events upon check-in, and they did EVERYTHING possible to make sure our stay was fabulous. The hotel in general is utterly gorgeous... marble floors in the lobby, in the bathrooms, beautiful artwork on every wall. The March of the Ducks brings a certain charm to the hotel... boy are they proud of those ducks! When we arrived in our King Suite, we were shocked at the size and amenities the room provided. One cannot comment enough about the comfort of the Peabody Dream Bed. The bed was absolutely the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. They even sell them on their website peabody at home. The linens were soft and luxurious. The suite has a sitting area with chair, couch, desk, and coffee table separate from the sleeping area. The television was large and hidden in a beautiful armoire. Peabody Hotel Robes were provided during the stay and more than enough towels were available in the room upon arrival. The toiletries were even coordinated to the hotel, with soaps in the shape of 3 dimensional ducks! Free newspapers and \"Architectural Digest\" magazine were in the room, along with a very handy guide listing all the local eateries. Room service was quite pricey, with the hotel charging nearly $55 for a 12 pack of beer. But, we never used room service anyway, so the high prices did not bother us. The best part was the special treats provided for us. Happy Birthday chocolates were left on the pillows, and on the day of our wedding, they provided a bottle of champagne, strawberries covered in white and dark chocolate (looked like tuxedos), and a sailboat made of chocolate. All of these \"treats\" were provided at no extra cost! This definitely made our stay much more enjoyable!!!! The pool was beautiful and not at all crowded. I especially enjoyed the hot tub, which was great for relaxing after the stress of a wedding and theme parks!!! We did not eat at the hotel, but went over to the Rosen Plaza Hotel and had an absolutely fabulous meal at Jack's Place. While the rack rates for this room are over $200/night, we only paid $95 per night from an online special. We had a car with us, so we did not need to utilize any shuttles or transports.

The Peabody is for you. I got the peabody for 75/night on priceline and I was So happy I did. Like you, I read many many reviews for the peabody and I was truly impressed with what I saw. During this review I will inform you all of the key questions I had that were never answered in ANY of the reviews. It was just me and my boyfriend there for a disney/universal studios vacation for 8 days. From the moment we stepped in, we KNEW we were going to enjoy our stay. When we checked in, I knew to ask for a high floor king bedroom with a (distant) view of disney's fireworks. (Thank you tripadvisor!!) Melanie made that dream come true checked us in early (1:00 pm), picked up our disney tickets that was delived from ticketmania from the concierge and we were off to the room. We went upstairs and everything was so Clean! It even smelled soapy. The TV is pretty big and modern for a hotel, and there are three phones, one next to the bed, on the desk and behind your toilet seat. I didn't get the famed TV in the bathroom, but I didn't notice until our last day there! Thats how much I didn't need it. The marble bathrooms were beautiful and the maid service was absolutely great, folding the toilet paper, placing the soap duck on top of the towels. Very nice touches in the bathroom. The Bed. My goodness, need I say anymore? You SINK in to that bed. I have learned to RESENT my own bed after sleeping in the Peabody's. There were nights I was full of energy when I got in, once I hit that bed I was out like a light. Its a wonderful place for naps in the middle of the day. That first day we jumped on the I-Trolley which was interesting to say the least, the drivers were nice and there are a LOT of things to do on I-drive. We went to belz (now prime) outlets and had a ball. It was about a slow 25 minute ride just to get out there. We used our free i-trolley passes that was included in the resort fee. The gave us two for everyday, we only ended up using 6. On the way back we walked to pizza hut, came back and ate and went to the pool. The pool is NICE. If never been in a heated pool before and man it does make a big difference. It was really really nice out there, i didn't get to hit the bar but that looked nice as well. The one thing that urked me was the fact that there is a separate kiddie pool that none of the parents take there kids to. I mean it IS a kiddie pool for a reason, so the adults can be in the main pool. Other than that we went in the pool twice during our stay and sure wished we could have went more often (IT WAS HOT). Side note: The pool DOES close at dusk but plenty times I looked out my window there were people swimming as late as 12am, with no lights...so I guess its at your own risk. Now here's the good stuff, the stuff I couldn't find on the site. DISNEY transportation is pretty good. On the 1st day we had ressies with Cinderella for 8:10 so we had to cab it. $35 people. Stick with MEARS! They provide a shuttle, a decent greyhound sized bus that is always on time and only $6 roundtrip per person. They have a station in the hotel, and the drivers are really nice. Thanks Raphael!! The $6 is really worth it. As for Universal Studios, I'd rather take a cab because with Mears its 14.00 per person round trip and with the cab its about $10-12 per person and a very easy ride. The Bellhop were extraordinary. Just magnificent. Their customer service is very very good. They were always there to help, Thank you. The ducks! They were cool, try to catch them on a weekday morning, on a tuesday it wasn't so crowded as people mentioned, it was quite comfortable. Shower's were nice, not just your basic showerhead you could change it to massage etc. There was a peabody robe which I did not use. B-Line was ok. We had Breakfast there and were not too impressed, the food was pretty bland to us. But it was hella convienent to have them open 24hrs a day! If you ever have a sweet tooth in the middle of the night, that is THE place to go! Lynx is right outside as well, I didn't ride it, although I did understand you could take it straight to universal studios which would be even cheaper, seems to run a LOT more frequently than the I-trolley. Restaurants withing walking distance (and for us walking distance is a mile) Sizzler, Pizza Hut,(takeout) McD's, Houlihans, Friendly's(good food, great service), Denny's (good food, great service) , IHOP(great food, great service), Johnny Rockets Diner, Red Lobster. Many Many more down the way. Did I mention there is a mall (although under construction) right across the street? Pointe Orlando, filled with shops and restaurants. I attended the gym facilities while there, not a bad selection at all. Several treadmills, ellipticals, stair masters, all top of the line brands, Lifefitness, Precor, etc. Strength machines were good also. Fee: 10 dollars, which includes locker. Check out was smooth, kinda lost my appetite when I saw the $60 resort fee bill that is mandatory. But I expected it, once again thanks to tripadvisor. I did request to checkout one hour later, which was granted, we waited and hung out with the ducks until mears came to pick us up. All in all, great hotel! You won't regret it. Really. Any questions?

My boyfriend had scheduled two massages for us that were supposed to be done side by side, but when we went for the massages we were told that they didn't do side by side and had to be done in seperate rooms that were on opposite sides of the building. that was a little disappointing. however, i had a great weekend and it was a nice hotel.", "Date": "June 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3496192", "Content": "We paid $75 per night at the Peabody via Priceline. Needless to say we weren't disappointed. The Peabody is by far the nicest hotel on I-Drive and in the best location. Our main interest during our stay was Universal, which was an easy drive. We didn't eat at any of the hotel restaurants...we made the short drive to the nearby McDonalds or Sizzler for breakfast, so that we could get to the parks sooner and tried many of the City Walk restaurants for dinner. Parking is free (except valet, of course) and the parking lot is very easily accessible to the hotel. Only downsides- they implemented a mandatory $7.00 nightly hotel fee which is \"mandatory\" for priceline users...the impression that I was left with is that it is optional for other guests, but not totally sure. But the 7.00 pays for itself...no parking fees, 2 bottled waters, internet access, free local and toll free calls are included for the 7.00. My husband was very disappointed with not having a coffee pot and having to pay a $10.00 fee to use the \"workout facilities\" On the last night there, they had a band that was playing at the House of Blues (I believe it was the band itself on our floor) they were very loud and disrespectful, however once security found out about it, they intervened....the officer actually pulled up a chair at the end of our hall to ensure peace and quiet for the rest of the night. All in all a nice hotel, I've stayed in better and worse. But then again, we feel that the hotel is not the destination...Priceline is really spoiling me", "Date": "May 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201ccomfortable stay\u201d", "Author": "MontrealVoyager", "ReviewID": "UR3477724", "Content": "Stayed on executive floor with lounge access.

They carry out the famous Peabody duck theme in fun surprising ways throughout the hotel (ex: mini duck shaped soaps, adorable b&w duck postcards). Beautiful, calming lobby and common areas. Extreme attention to details . . . Comfy robe in closet, wonderful matress & bedding, nice assortment of tolietries. . . I had them deliver a crib for my Toddler . . . in the crib was a babycare kit (lotion, powder etc . . .) as well as a miniture rubber ducky and baby blanket. The Large clean pool heated to just the right tempature. Also large whirlpool for the adults and seperate wading pool for the kids. Stayed on the 20th floor and I have to say the Peabody's elevator has to be the fastest one I've ever expirenced in a hotel. As for the Peabody's duck parade into the foutain, don't blink - it last about 2 seconds. Not overly impressive. We stayed at the Peabody after spending the first couple of days of our Orlando trip at the Disney Yatch Club. I enjoyed my stay at the Peabody as much if not more. The Peabody is not design for Children however, they were very accomdation to our toddler. I especially liked the price of the Peabody $104.00 on Hotwire. Disney's Yatch club ran $420.00 per night.
