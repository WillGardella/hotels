No swimming pool, but access to California Hotel pool a block away. No wi-fi available, even in lobby. There is a pay-for-use stand-up internet kiosk in the lobby, with prinitng. I honestly don't know any reason to stay here, unless you can't find another vacancy.

Take out or sit down. Also, Tony Roma's is here. And the ubiquitous buffet. Their cafe shares space with the buffet, so is crowded and the service suffers. Dunkin Donuts. A steak house.

An inexpensive stay in downtown Las Vegas. You definitely get what you pay for. We kind of got \"stuck\" here because we were attending a conference downtown at The Golden Nugget. Unfortunately our boss waited until the last minute to tell us we were going and the Nugget was full. Transportation back and forth from the strip was too expensive. We were told that the Fremont Hotel was our best option so we took it. First of all, don't let the name fool you. This is not a \"hotel.\" This is a \"motel.\" We stayed our first nights (pre-business) at The Pallazzo on the strip and this was good and bad. Good because it was a FABULOUS experience and kind of cushioned us for our fall when we arrived at the Fremont. Bad because it spoiled us and made the Fremont and even bigger let down. If you want luxury in any form, the Fremont is not what you want. It's basic and meager. The reviews we read before going said the room was clean. Ours not so much. You have to literally beg to get a blanket and when we got it, gross. It was like it was made of a form of melted plastic. The bathroom was so tiny even one person had to move carefully. The toilet was angled in the corner to make enough room to close the door. The shower was for a short person (but did have hot water, which is always a plus). The casino is a typical downtown experience. Super, duper smoky and packed all the time. There's a Dunkin Donuts which was kind of convenient for coffee (this was new info for me - there are not coffee pots in Vegas hotel rooms) and a morning danish, but all the food is sitting out so when you big into it (it makes me gag thinking about it) it takes like a smoked cigarette - yuck. Our room was on the Fremont Street side and until 1 a.m. or later, Fremont Street does a lights show with blaring music and fighter jet sounds. It was miserable when you had to be at 8 a.m. meetings. You can't beat the price for $50 a night - but you get what you pay for. Since we were at a conference at The Golden Nugget, we got to see some of the rooms, even in the non-remodeled Carson Tower. They were very spacious and really nice. I would never, ever stay at the Fremont again. If your'e going to Vegas on a dime, this is the place for you. But FYI, Vegas is not fun when you're going on a dime.

The decor was nice and modern and the room was clean. My big complaint is about the service. It is like they took everyone who had been fired for being rude at all of the other casinos and hired them on at the Fremont. My first run in was at the Players card booth. The lady working behind the counter acted as though she was upset that I asked a question and interrupted her conversation with another employee. Check in was not as pleasant as it could be, it was more like checking in at a public health clinic. Housekeeping was great, although I tend to tip them well. One bartender acted like it was an imposition when we asked about drink specials, but another bartender made up for that later. I knew what it was before I went. We chose to stay downtown because during our last trip we had found the big resort casino we stayed at to be a bit more flashy and showy for our tastes. We were hoping for something a little more middle of the road with the Fremont. I know that downtown is more for an older crowd, but it seemed like unless you were over 60 years of age or a bit on the trashy side, you did not get good customer service.

Vegas especially offers a very wide array of choices, so you really need to ask that all important question. Do you want glitz and glamor, pretty people and high end entertainment, spas and shopping?

Or if we were looking for just a basic, more budget minded, gamble a little play a little trip, then downtown might be our choice. This trip was a business trip, and downtown was simply more convenient, to say nothing of less costly. This was my first stay at the Fremont and it fit the bill very nicely, thank you. The room while not large was more than adequate. It was clean, as has been mentioned in some other reviews, tastefully redecorated recently. It was a nonsmoking room/floor and I didn't detect any smoke odor in the room although a little from the main floor does make it's way into the hall around the elevator. The bed, pillows and bedding were comfortable. The bath room was small, while I had no problems, it is a one person at a time proposition. Loved the water pressure, huge plus for me. Restauranting downtown offers a pretty wide choice, I opt mostly for sandwiches etc when not entertaining. People-watching under the canopy of the Fremont Experience is almost as good as any number of the shows one can see on the strip. But as I have said this was first and foremost a business trip. The staff was extremely friendly did their job well. Housekeeping missed servicing my in-room coffee, front desk handled it in a timely fashion. Check out was a little slow with only one person on station. Al in all have to give it a thumbs up. Not fancy, but the equal of any mid-range Motel chain.

We just recently got back from an 11/11/11 trip and definitely enjoyed bringing back home all the money we went up with, plus more. We enjoyed playing every single day (6 days of fun) around the clock at the Fremont and other downtown vicinity hotels. Rooms have been updated as far as the decor goes, can't change the size of the room, but it's still kept clean, no flat screen tv, but that's ok, we're not here to stare at walls 24/7 or the TV...but strictly to play, enjoy and have a lot of fun, which we always get when staying at the Fremont. Table games, slot machines, poker machines, you name it, they got it and a lot of guests to boot, which makes this one of the best old times downtown \"happening\" hotels on the Fremont street experience. Now, don't go there expecting a 4 or 5 diamond rated room, because like I mentioned earlier, its \"old time\" Vegas, and not your spa & resort style uptown atmosphere, but the years of \"old gone by,\" where the real gamblers of past preferred staying and still do. As far as food goes, we skipped the buffet this time because most of our family vacationing there were staying at either the Main Street Station or the California (all Boyd hotels), so most meals were usually at the Main Street station hotel & casino. We did pick up some last minute in-between and after gambling eats at the open cafe where you can find a variety of fast food such as chinese, American, etc. and I can't forget to mention that huge bowl of delicious oxtail soup (with rice), you'll just have to try this one out. Also, be sure to try Tony Roma's restaurant, known to make some excellent ribs and other goodies, but, be sure to make reservations in advance. The overall happy atmosphere at this hotel is due not only to the type of guests that patronize this place, but also due to a lot of friendly, courteous and professional employees who'll help to make your stay comfortable, enjoyable and memorable. As far as parking goes, I normally only do valet in Vegas, hey, just let them park your car (it's much safer), and what's a two or three dollar tip when you'll be dropping even more into that slot machine or on that favorite table game of yours, for me, I call it convenience by getting right off at the the front door. Fremont is one of the best located downtown hotels there is with a 1 minute walk (I'm not kidding either) to Binions, Golden Nugget and the Four Queens casino & hotel. Fremont is a \"Boyds\" casino, & one can venture to it's sister properties, the Main Street Station or the California hotel & casino via a 4 - 5 min. walk down the street.

One part is The Strip, with upper end properties like the Bellagio, Caesars, Treasure Island, Venetian and Wynn; the other is Fremont Street/Downtown, with properties like the Four Queens, Golden Nugget, El Cortez, Plaza and Fremont. If you are after glitz, glamour and beautiful people, try the Strip. If your taste is more pedestrian, you very well might enjoy the Fremont. At the price I paid, $40 per night for a king bed room, it was perfect. Yes, the room TV\u2019s are not flat screens, nor are there many channels, and if you need Internet, keep looking. But if you want a basic comfortable room, you could do a whole lot worse. Kudos to the sixth floor housekeeping staff, who could not have been friendlier or more accommodating. I checked in on October 24, several hours before the stated 3PM check in. Elevators were quick and the lobby had plenty of seating. My room, 631, was quiet, clean and well lit. The bed was plenty firm and while the air conditioner/heating unit under the window was older it was efficient. There was an upholstered easy chair and all of the standard bathroom toiletries. The four window shades were slat-styled and one window opened about six inches. The Fremont is in a quadrant that includes Binions, the Golden Nugget and the Four Queens. All have excellent, economical food choices, as does the Golden Gate a block away in one direction and the Fitz, a block away in the other direction. Meal comps/discounts are far easier to come by Downtown than at the Strip, and table minimums are as low as $2. I know that I am going to lose money gambling in Vegas, and the lower minimums make losing far more fun. The Fremont Hotel is a safe, reliable and economical hotel with amble dining options, under the Fremont Street Experience canopy, but if you demand The Strip type treatment you probably should book elsewhere. For travelers who want to save cab fare to and from the airport, which can be $40 or more each way, consider the new, public Westcliff Airport Express (WAX Bus) operated by the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada. It runs every hour; the trip is $2 (paid as you board) and takes 30 minutes. At the airport, follow the signs in baggage claim to Ground Zero, walk across the access road and all the way to the right. The Fremont Hotel stop is at 4th and Carson, and the drivers are helpful. It\u2019s a two block walk to the Fremont and on the way back to the airport, the bus stop is literally across the street from the Fremont. (http://www.rtcsouthernnevada.com/transit/route/westcliff/westcliff(09-18-11).pdf).

The brunch buffet was good and I have to thank Ramon for keeping the champagne flowing.

The Freemont has given us more complimentary offers over the past 2 years than any other hotel and I am not dissapointed we took a chance and stayed. Based on the recent comps I can say I will return. The Silverton Hotel although 10 minutes off the strip is also a wonderful budget minded hotel. If you are looking for upscale modern perks I would highly suggest the Signature at MGM Grande. We stayed there our last visit and it was amazing! Last I checked though they have not offered 5 complimentary days as other smaller casinos have. If you love the main strip and are not into downtown but want to stay at Freemont rent a car. Dealing with the Deuce can be somewhat of a hassle. All in all I would reccomend the Freemont Hotel as a very good option for the budget minded.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cFremont is a Great Hotel/Casino Downtown\u201d", "Author": "VegasTraveler_11", "ReviewID": "UR99177031", "Content": "I recently stayed here over the weekend.

My husband and I stayed in here just fine. We even had a couple friends in the room drinking with us for a while, and we had more than enough space.

We were on the 4th floor facing Binions and we didn't hear any of the (cab or car noise) others had complained about. The only thing that could have made our stay better was if they offered room service. Luckily there were some little places to eat right down stairs with very good prices.

We never at there for the whole week. Needed a refrigerator, wasn't enough plugs in the hotel room for phone charging, computer hookup, lights, tv, clock and refrigerator. We had to unplug a couple items. Last day leaving and I needed to use cart to carry luggage to my car. Went downstairs to front desk and asked may I use the cart. The Rep at the counter said that the Bellhop would be right back, they are understaffed today (even though it's 4th of July weekend?). I stated that I was in a hurry, the Rep stated that for insurance reasons that guests aren't allowed to use the carts without a Bellhop, they are paid for assist guests in that way. I completely understand, but I couldn't wait, so I just brought everything down myself. I had 2 luggages for each my daughter and I, our laptop bags (2), bag of food (1 big bag), gifts we bought, purses, we had a total of probably about 10 bags. Got downstairs, had everything in front of the elevator. Bellhop and Rep behind the counter watched me bring everything out of the elevator. I went to the front desk again in front of the Bellhop and asked could I use the cart again. Now, I would think that someone looking at a woman and a girl bring 10 bags out of the elevator would bring the cart over (mind you there were no customers at this time) and just assist them in loading the cart and taking it to my car. I assumed wrong. Once again, the Rep said that I cannot let you use the cart without the Bellhop, but the Bellhop just stood there and stared at me. I said, 'you see my things there.' He said again, we can't let you use it for insurance reasons. Then the Bellhop says, 'You can't use my cart without me.\" I just looked at them both and I was about to say, \"Do I need to ask?\", but then I stopped and just began picking my things up and taking them to me car myself. The Valet helped me place my bags in my car. I went back to speak to the Rep, but by then he had a customer. So I gave the Valet a $20 tip. For doing his job and the Bellhop's job (according to the insurance provision said the Rep behind the counter).

I walked the 20 steps to check-in where my room was ready even though I was there early in the morning. The tower elevators are just another 20 steps from check-in and I was in my room about 10 minutes after arrival. Of course this was a Thursday morning and I'm sure that it's not quite that quick during busy weekend times. The Fremont is an older hotel and not luxurious by any standard. However the room was clean and roomy enough even though it was a tad on the worn side. Hey it was under $ 40.00 a night when I was there. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom clean, and the TV worked! The noise level from the street at night can be a little bothersome, but it quiets down after midnight. It's in the middle of Fremont street action so that's to be expected. Ask for a floor on the upper floors and away from the street to avoid the noise. The staff in the hotel and the casino was courteous, friendly, and helpful all around. It's a much slower pace than the strip and a much older demographic during the week. The buffet is very nice and very inexpensive. There was no \u201cresort fee\u201d added to the bill.

The air conditioner in the room could not be controlled and was cold at times.

Checked in around 2pm and the process took less than a minute. Very friendly check in, almost scary that this could take such short time. Felt like everyone knew us like neighbors. Our room did not have a safe (was removed for some reason) so they moved us to another room on the same floor immediately after maintenance came and looked at the room. Bathroom is small but clean and no problem for us. It might be a problem if there were four people trying to get ready for a dressier event at the same time but we just gambled the whole trip. Everything else in the room was just fine. True, there are not many TV channels but there was local news, ESPN, national news, and weather channel. The location is close to everything. Played a lot at Golden Gate because they had $3 blackjack and always openings at the $5 tables. The California was good because the had the Let It Ride table open in the morning. The 99 cent shrimp cocktail at the Golden Gate is great and David Sommers playing the piano at the bar was super. The pickup and drop off for the duece (bus to the strip) was very close. We did not like the gambling at the Fremont because the Let it Ride did not open until about 8pm, we couldn't get on a blackjack table in the evening, and the blackjack table (dealing out of a shoe) was not open in the morning. We ate breakfast at the Fremont every morning and liked the buffet. Can not complain about the price. Two evening meals at the 4 queens was also very good. One evening meal at the California was not very good. Will definately stay here on our future trips. We go to Vegas about once a year or every 9 months.

I joined other family members there as we celebrated a landmark birthday for my Mother. I like staying downtown in \"Old\" Las Vegas--everything you need is right there and there are plenty of cheap shuttles or buses if you wish to go to the Strip or to the Mall or anywhere else. As other reviewers have said, the rooms at the Fremont are reasonably priced and adequate. I do not need a fancy hotel, but I like cleanliness and comfort. My bed and pillow were very comfortable and the sheets were crisp and clean; the lady from housekeeping, Katie, was very pleasant and accommodating and asked every day if we wanted our sheets changed. In my Mother's room there was a problem with the water not draining out of the tub, and we reported this; the plumber came right up and discovered the same problem in our neighbor's tub and snaked out the drain. . . I really did not want to know about all this. The bathrooms are small, reminding me of bathrooms in Italian hotels. The water in the shower is marvelously hot and the pressure, great. I loved the view in my room of the Sierra Nevadas and the nearby hotels. Unfortunately, the windows do not open, at all, so you can't get a breath of fresh air. There is an air conditioner/heating unit in the room which makes for some kind of air circulation; despite this, and despite the fact that we were on a no smoking floor, secondhand smoke drifted up through the elevator shaft, I guess, and sometimes came into my room under the door. I rolled up a towel and put it against the space under the door when I went to bed at night. There is also a considerable amount of cigarette smoke in the casino on the lower level which you have to walk through to get to your room. There was a small keyed safe in the room, an ironing board and iron, a hair dryer, plenty of towels, cups, ice bucket, and a TV. The usual pad of hotel paper was missing, there were just a few little pieces of white paper and a pen. Plenty of hangers. An upholstered chair and little table and also suitcase stands. The Fremont provided my Mother with some coupons for discounts in the hotel's restaurants; although they looked nice, the coupons weren't all that much of a bargain. We ate at the Paradise Buffet on a Friday night when it was seafood night, and it was a real disappointment. I guess, being a New Englander, I should know to avoid seafood out West, but this used to be a really nice buffet. I think the restaurant has been cutting corners to save money as the quality was not that high--iceberg lettuce on the salad bar and few interesting raw veggies for the salad; manufactured rolls and desserts; breaded shrimp that looked like Mrs. Paul's, etc. The restaurant space was gorgeous, but the hotel should be more careful because the quality is slipping. I liked the new Dunkin Donuts tucked away in a corner of the casino--nice for an inexpensive coffee and bagel. And we always love the 99 cent margaritas! I am not a wild gambler, but I play the slots a little. I have had one of the casino's \"Gold Cards\" that you put in the machine to tot up your credits. In all my visits through the years, I have never been able to use my credits for anything because the Fremont says you need to first reach 5,000 credits before you can cash them in for a meal, etc. Well, this is a ridiculous policy. I use my other little card at Binion's Horseshoe across the street and you can redeem your credits, no matter how few they are, towards a meal any time you wish; you don't even have to get a \"comp coupon\" ahead of time. In general, I would say that everything cost more in all the casinos and restaurants during this visit to Vegas; seems everyone has raised their prices to accommodate the current economy in the U.S. I guess. Even the slots were miserably tight, although I did see a few folks around me hitting four of a kind once in awhile.

A week later, the rate had dropped, and when I emailed, they matched the new rate. By the time I checked in, the rate was up again, but I still paid the lower price I had locked in. Check-in was friendly, painless and fast. The elevators were across from the front desk; no extra walks on narrow paths between slot machines. The room was small but adequate; so was the bathroom. It was all clean, and the bed was soft and comfortable. Adjustable wooden shutters filtered most of the morning light from the window. The old-fashioned air conditioner cooled the room just right when running at full blast. The TV channel selection was very basic, but had the local networks, the Weather Channel, TBS and ESPN. Free shampoo, conditioner and lotion. There was a wall safe too small for most laptops, an iron and ironing board, a hair drier, but no coffee maker. There were several very well-priced dining options and a 24-hour Dunkin Donuts. It was an easy walk to the entertainment of Fremont Street, or to catch the 108 city bus going to the Convention Center or the airport.

We got the two beds we requested and going to the room was a breeze - the elevator was right across from the registration desk (no long walks!) and our room was two doors down from the elevator.

Even for breakfast, the items were heavy and the selection was good. The price was $10.99, however, and not $6+, as we were there on a weekend. The hotel has a Dunkin Donuts branch, but If you want to purchase any food there, my advice woud be to get them ONLY in the morning when they're fresh. For those unfamiliar with the Fremont Street Experience or the hotel area, the hotel's official address is on Fremont St. but drivers can't use that road to locate the hotel. From south Las Vegas Blvd, go past Fremont St. and make a left on the next block (Ogden St.) and make another left after 3rd St. and look for the building's parking entrance on the left.

The room is on the small side, but plenty for two people. Bathroom is admittedly cramped, but functional. The food at the Buffet is above average in my opinion, and for the price it has real value. Dinner was $28 for me and my hubby. They had made to order steaks, a carving station, wide selection of seafood and fish, desserts, etc. We ate here twice. The Lenai Express place had some Asian dishes and quickie type food. We also ate at Tony Roma's, again great, and between 4:30 and 7:30 they have a full prime rib dinner for $8! Very good and again great value. Oh and don't miss the $1 margarita's at the casino bar! Downtown Vegas itself has pros and cons. The police are out everywhere, so as long as you stick to the main \"drag\" you will be safe. That being said, there are more \"undesirables\" hanging around the casinos than on the strip. I am not a prejudiced or snobby person, but you can tell when a homeless guy gets a buck and comes and sits next to you at a slot.

The television small with limited free stations. I would like to have a better selection of channels. An mini-refigerator and a cofee maker would also have been nice. The only area in the room that didn't seem updated was where the luggage, clothes hangers and iron/ironing board were stored (see picture). There was also a \"safebox\" that locked with a key. It was pretty flimsy by way of a safe, but at least you could lock up any valuables. I had breakfast and dinner at the Paradise Buffet which served mediocre to average fare. I feel I got a good value for the price paid -- better ambience compared to a similarly priced (overpriced) property like Best Western, Ramada Inn, Hampton Inn, Holiday Inn and others of that calibre.", "Date": "January 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clinton, Ct.", "Title": "\u201cHandy to Everything!!\u201d", "Author": "raymar63", "ReviewID": "UR12731117", "Content": "Stayed at the Fremont Jan.5-9, 2008.

We have stayed on the strip many times, but looked to save a few bucks on the room for extra gambling money by staying downtown. We are glad that we did, and would stay at the Fremont again. It is not a mega resort with glitsy shows and sights, but is more than sufficient if you want a clean cheaper priced room to sleep in down town. Give it a shot if you plan on trying a stay downtown. The casino was also decent, however there is no poker room. We enjoyed the dowtown atmosphere for gambling, and took a drive to the strip to see a show, but returned downtown for a cheaper gamble.

However, most of the hotels on the strip (and many off of the strip) were running $120-$250 for Saturday, July 21. I was traveling with my wife and we both realized that this was waaaay too much to pay for a room when that we would spend so little time in. My first thought was the Orleans, but their rooms were running around $120/night for a Saturday stay. With this in mind, I checked around and found a $60/night rate at the Fremont. We had never stayed downtown before but figured we would give it a try.... As others have stated, the room itself was clean and VERY small. Some of the furniture looked updated, but gernally speaking, the room itself was VERY old and dated looking (same for the hallways and common areas). The a/c worked ok but not great and the T.V. got very few channles. However, none of this was very important because after a long day of traveling all we did was fall asleep anyway. In summary, If you're looking for BASIC accomodations at a bargain price in downtown Vegas I think the Fremont fits the bill without a problem.

No, the casino, lobby and main areas are all the same, but the rooms have all been tastefully redone and they are very, very nice. Subtle tones, new bedding, and a shower curtain rod that keeps the curtain from flying all over the place during a shower. Sure the Fremont isn't the Wynn, nor does it try to be. The rooms are tiny and old Vegas. Back in the day players weren't expected to stay in their rooms, they were expected to be on the casino floor, so the old rooms are small.

Hubby and I had played at the Fremont the previous year and received multiple offers to come back for a comp visit. Thank goodness I put the \"rewards play\" in my name. At any rate, This was our third stop in a 5 day trip and a three night visit was the Finale in Vegas. This was my first over night at \"TF\". Arrived earlier than check-in (by about 3 hours) and much to my pleasure found valet parking, had a wonderful bellman unload our stuff, three women can pack it in. My front desk visit/check-in was quite tidy and quick, (no problem with checking in early either), I was met with warm friendly faces and professional service. The check-in area was roomy enough, and tucked away from the hubbub of the casino and any other obstruction. There is no long walk if you enter at the right spot and valet parking is right there. So are the elevators. All so convenient and easy! Once to the room, at first I was shocked at how small. But soon realized it was very clean, quaint and very Zen in design and feeling. I requested back side (away from the laser show noise). The room was nice and cool, the air conditioner provided a gentle hum and we never heard much of anything from outside, except an occasional siren and one day guys were beating on a pipe next door. Not an issue. There was a nearby outside stairwell that my cousin could smoke in. THE BEDS WERE AWESOME. I slept like a baby, when I slept. Casino was great, wish they would have a PaiGow table. I have to say my only disappointment was Tony Roma's, my steak was like leather. Other food great - I sampled most places. The Cafe, after hours in the Buffet was superb and our waiter was a dream.

Using \"caution\" we ducked under the tape and began to play the slots. We were immediately and rudely adressed by a staff member stating the area was closed for cleaning. Shortly thereafter, a security officer politely told us to leave the area. I explained that in Indiana , caution meant to proceed using care and thats what I had done. He laughed it off, but ordered us out of the area. Oh well, I saved money and they lost money that night. The comps are becomming hard to come by. Free meals used to flow freely. The Players Card staff seemed very hesitant to issue any free meals, as they have done in the past. We won nothing while gambling at the Fremont.
