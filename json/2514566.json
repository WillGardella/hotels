My boyfriend kept telling me to stop worrying about the hotel because i went off other peoples reviews and to be quite honest, he was right by telling me not to worry because it was brilliant. We stayed on the 17th floor overlooking the Times Warner buildings and lit up at night is nice to see every time you close your blinds. It was annoying with sirens going off all the time but no matter where you go you won't get away from that. The doormen were always more than helpful and telling us to have a nice day and greeting us at night time.

Once in the lobby you do get a sense that the hotel is different. You feel almost as if you are in a greenhouse. The outdoor patio areas(while I did not use on this trip due to the winter weather) are a great place to hang out as well as the library indoors. The thing that sets this hotel apart is the extremely welcoming and helpful staff. I have eaten at the restraurant in the past and it was very good. I like to walk down to whole foods when I stay here and get breakfast from the food bar or lunch from the food bar and take a walk in Central Park. One of my favorite restaurants is in this neighborhood....Guantanamera which has Cuban fusion food and great latin jazz and is quite reasonable in cost. One comment on the dim hallways, don't be put off, when we were there it looked like they were sprucing them up.

Columbus Circle is a busy, stylish, jumping off point for a lot of different adventures. Atmosphere: a trendy boutique hotel with an unusual lobby. Public spaces are very dark, including the hallways. Rooms: I've only experienced a small room with insufficient space for two carry-on suitcases. The bathroom is also uncomfortably small. If you're a large person or claustrophobic, you will probably be uncomfortable. If you're average size and flexible, you'll be fine. If you're petite and travel very light, this place was designed for you. Overall, the location makes up for a lot. Also the housekeeping staff do a great job, the place is very clean.

There are double paned windows, which we had closed and yet noise was present. After a little investigation we figured the air conditioner was the culprit, the type used requires it exhaust to the outside, meaning you have an opening in the wall for air and noise transfer. Fortunately, it was not so loud as to prevent sleep. If you're expecting a traditional beige hotel like many national chains, The Hudson is not that. Yes, the overall feel is dark but in a considered and deliberate way, not because of lack of light fixtures. The lighting adds to the style of the hotel, which is certainly Urban.

Bathroom too small to use the blowdryer with the door closed, you have to leave the door open and kind of use the hallway space as well. But, the weirdest thing is the window into the bath from the bedroom. It is covered by a sheer net curtain, and you can see in quite clearly. Also, when you take a shower, there is a curtain on both sides of you and they both kind of blow into the tub making you feel like you are wrapped up like a mummy.

One night, the heater/AC unit started banging in the middle of the night, and took quite a while to stop.

The location is excellent right next to columbus station and central park. Found some lovely restaurants close by, opposite Carnegie Hall for breakfast... beautiful. The price of drink in the bar was way too high .. very disappointing really .. but we found this to be the case all through New York. The staff were excellent and very helpful and food was very good also. We did the High Line Walk and visited the Irish Hunger Memorial - both well worth a visit as we stopped off at the Chelsea Market also - excellent. We had done alot of tourist related things on previous visits to NY so we didn't revisit them . However, we did take in another show in Radio City - this was excellent as usual. Shopping was great of course. We had another fantastic trip to NY - I woudl definitely recommend this hotel for its cleanliness, locaition and staff but please, turn on a few lights or change the paint .....", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFunky hotel, suited for younger travellers\u201d", "Author": "Brownfish28", "ReviewID": "UR124816906", "Content": "Great hotel, the decor and bars are brilliant in the hotel.

The bedroom area was literally the size of my walk-in closet, which is 9x9; I paced it out. Room for the queen-size bed, a teensy utility table and an uncomfortable chair. The shower was literally 24 inches x 46 inches (I counted the tiles). The (small) toilet left my knees about 6 inches from the wall...and I'm 4'-11\"! If I were a left-handed guy, I couldn't have shaved using the sink. My husband, who is 6'-8\" would not have fit in the space at all! It was also 90 degrees when I walked in. I promptly turned on the A.C. to 60, but kept it at 65 during the night, which worked fine for me. The closet consisted of a 2' rod with about half a dozen hangers; the ironing board did NOT hang on the wall, so it kept falling over and I had to set up the luggage rack to keep it away from my clothes, which was quite inconvenient. The luggage rack wouldn't have fit anywhere else, except maybe the miniscule hallway, but one would have tripped over it getting to the bathroom. More on the funky bathroom. The side of the shower wall consisted of clear glass with a white fabric shower curtain. On the room side, there was a filmy (inexpensive) white nylon curtain. The entrance to the shower was likewise covered by a white fabric shower curtain. On the whole, three rooms in this hotel would have made up into two decent-sized rooms, but then again, they couldn't have packed us in like lemmings...NOT that the hotel was anywhere near filled. As I said, I paid only a hundred bucks for my room...the rack rate being about $150. I don't know how packed they are on weekends, but they certainly weren't full during the weekday I was there. OK those are the negatives. On the plus side, the room was very clean and had lovely linens and a very comfy (if low-slung) bed...more on a futon-style size. A normal height bed would have made the room look even smaller. It was quiet by NYC standards. I was in town overnight for surgery the next day, and for an inexpensive room (you can bid online; I got it for $100) it was quite decent. The neighborhood is also safe, a huge plus. As a former New Yorker, I can tell you it's convenient...close to 57th St., so transportation is decent--crosstown buses, the #5 which goes down 5th Avenue passes nearby, as do 7th Ave. buses (hop one to get to Times Sq.), and uptown 8th Ave. buses. It's also near Columbus Circle (and not far from Lincoln Center) for the #1 local train (7th Ave. IRT) and the A train (8th Ave.). I was too tired to go out for dinner, but the hotel food was decent and \"tres nouvelle.\" (See my review for details.) I'd rate the room size a 1, but the quality of the room a 4, so it averages out to a 2.5-3. Now more on the hotel, which I found fascinatingly funky. I was probably the oldest patron in the hotel (I'm 64); seems to cater to a late 20's to 30-something crowd, most of whom are techno-trendies (or wannabees). The front of the hotel doesn't look like a hotel...no grand marquee...and you take a long escalator up to the lobby, which is dark, spattered by pools of light. A Grand Chandelier hangs over one of the front desk receptionists, sort of a crystal Sword of Damocles. My receptionist was a nice guy who smirked when I asked if the room was the size of a closet with an air shaft. He told me that the single rooms were smaller. I couldn't possibly .imagine. A bank of elevators off to the east side of the lobby was, likewise, dark. It has about 22 floors and a warren of rooms on each floor. The overriding decor in the hallways was institutional cell grey with white doors. Lots of doors. Lots of little cells. Oh, and the bath ameneties were nice and first-rate. An ok place, but not if you travel in pairs and definitely NOT for families. Nary a child in sight, which in some instances could be considered a blessing.

Within 100 meters (300 ft) you find such things as the Central Park, the Lincoln Center, Fordham University, and the nicest specialty shops. Even on the very same sidewalk you find a few have-it-all delis, an ultimate-taste sushi place, a pharmacy, a theater, a club, and so forth. And this is without a doubt a one-of-a-kind styled hotel; astonishingly modern and sophisticated in every single corner outside in, which does not bore you even after seeing it several days in a row. The internal patio is worth a visit more than a couple of times. Staff is really kind and willing to help in all matters. From the receptionists to the maintenance people answer to questions and request with an honest smile and a smart joke. One of the problems might be that too many people like the hotel, and the hotel like too many people. So it is basically crowded 24/7: a line for checking-in, a line for checking-out, a line for luggage picking, and an incredible never-less-than-5-full-minute wait for an elevator to come (two elevators being out of service might have been the main cause). And it gets so noisy at the super fancy lobby and bar that it is impossible to hold a normal conversation there. A curious note is that the complete darkness that decorates the common areas\u2019 ambiance forces everyone to walk or seat around carefully, for them not to bump onto people or things. The rooms do not match the cool style of the hotel. They are so small that you can\u2019t fit more than three or four suits into the hole-in-the-wall, no-door wardrobe.

It felt opulent, stylish and heavenly. We treasured every moment of our 4 nights here. The library bar is an extraordinary dream, the terrace bars (both on the mezzanine level and on the roof-top) are some of the most ambient I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying: just pay the money for an exquisite cocktail and drink it as slowly as you can, so you can soak up the public spaces for as long as possible. I cherished every crevice of this accomplished space. The dark wood pannelled walls of our room and all the mirrors created the feel of a sexy captain's master suite on a romantic and masculine ship from a story-book. I even loved the elevator interiors, the hallways and the bathrooms, the light fittings and all the over-sized sculptures and plant pots. Phillip Stark excelled himself here and even the other guests were super cool, but in a warm and smiling way. I've stayed at many hotels before and after this that have tried to pull off this style, but none have achieved it like the Hudson has. The lobby is a work of art with the vine clad atrium above, and all the red brick work is so tactile and warming. Staying here makes you feel like you have truly 'arrived'. It doesn't matter what it cost, because it was worth every hard earned cent to stay there for 4 nights of extreme urban grooviness. That said, I guess you have to know who you are to stay here and embrace it, as it might be a bit intimidating for the faint-hearted and you absolutely have to appreciate post-modern high end, experimental interior design and feel enchanted by dark spaces interspersed with carefully selective lighting. You also have to be completely comfortable with the experience of being surrounded by stunning model types, hip professional types and the occasional rap star. I loved it. The location is brilliant; just a skip down the street from Central Park and MOMA, the MET and all the posh stores, and around the corner from the character-rich Hells Kitchen, with its street markets that run for a dozen city blocks, and countless multicultural cheap eats.

My stay was below expectations. Still, I didn't think about complaining until I dealt with the bellmen. First, as our bellman led us to the curb, he yells to another Hudson bellhop standing about 10-20 ft away, \"Hey, do that funny Chinese voice, you do.\" The other bellhop doesn't respond so our bellhop continues by saying something along the lines of, \"Me have no money\" with what sounds like his version of a Chinese accent. It was particularly strange because my wife and I are both Asian. This made me uneasy, but it's what followed that drove me to write a negative review. We told the bellhop that we were going to LaGuardia. A cab pulled up and the bellhop approached the cab. Before we were able to get close to the cab, the same cab drove off and when we asked why it left, the bellhop told us the cab driver didn't want to drive to Queens. Of course this is strange since under the Driver Rule 54-20, it is against the law to refuse a person based on destination so long as it is within the five boroughs. A few seconds later, a cab came, the bellman approached the cab and then waived us and the bellman with our bags over. Once we got into the cab, we asked the driver what's wrong with Queens, is the traffic bad? He laughed instantly and said there was nothing wrong with traffic, but the bellman asked for $2 and he gave it to the bellman. Based on the driver's reaction it seemed like a common practice at Hudson and maybe even throughout the city. I would have just dismissed this explanation from the cab driver except I noticed the previous day a bellhop approaching a cab, talking to the cab driver for several seconds and then telling him to get lost and to continuing driving even though hotel guests were clearly waiting for a cab. I left a message for the Hudson manager but no reply after one work day. Why did the bellhops' scam bother me so much? 1. All employees are extensions of the hotel. If the bellhop undermines his service to you for a $2 vig from the cab driver, do you feel good about leaving your personal belongings in the hotel room? Do you feel good about changing or showering without concern that there is a peephole somewhere? Once we got to the airport, my wife and I opened our bags and had to check to make sure nothing was stolen. 2. It could have harmed an innocent party. If I reported what was probably an innocent cab driver under the Refusal Law, he still may have been on the hook for a $200-$350 fine. 3. Nobody likes to get ripped off. Even though it only cost me a few seconds of my time, it does not change the fact that Hudson subsidizes their bellhop paychecks by playing tourists for fools. SUMMARY Hudson hotel is a great place to go for drinks, but it is really a NYC budget hotel with a very very hip common area. Considering that I only paid around $350 for New Year's Eve (other hotels charged $400+), maybe I can't expect too much from the place, but the heat did not work properly and the front desk didn't answer my phone call when I tried to report the problem (first time that I've called a hotel front desk with no answer). BUT, worst of all were the bellboys on my way out. It is a shame because the front desk people were energetic and friendly. PROS: Nice location, very hip decor and cool vibe in the common areas. Front desk people were friendly and energetic. CONS: Some sketchy bellhops, tiny smelly bathroom and weathered hallway carpets. I've visited HK , Tokyo and other NYC hotels and this bathroom was the smallest I've seen. On my floor, several of the rooms' frames had pry indentations from forced entry. Maybe this was done by hotel management, but it still created some uneasiness.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cOK, BAD ATTENTION\u201d", "Author": "Lorenzo R", "ReviewID": "UR122442038", "Content": "I made a booking and when I get there nobody had any idea about my reservation.

Its one of those hotels where you have to know its there to know its there, with a bare concrete front and a fluorescent entrance with an escalator taking you up to the main foyer. Very discreet and cool. Big entrance foyer with a separate concierge area and large glass windows giving you a view out into the garden area. We stayed up on the 15th floor (the higher the better in New York as the lower floors can be really noisy due to how busy the city is). Our room was nice, well equipped but extremely small. That small in fact that we were unable to have both suitcases out at the same time. We had a regular queen room. Once you get over how small the room what is apparant is that you get a really nice bed, high quality bed linen, very effective air conditioning and a nice Sony LCD tv with full cable tv and an Ipod dock. Plug sockets are very limited so be warned if your charging phones, laptops, using hair dryers etc. Bathroom again tiny, barely big enough to get in and close the door, but good toiletries, nice towels and a powerful shower. If your holiday revolves around staying in the room then your best off looking else where. If howerver you want a crashpad to see the city then this is perfect as its only 10 minutes walk from Times Square and 5 minutes from Columbus circle. Because its on a cross street its far quieter than staying on one of the main north south routes. Staff excellent, really friendly and relaxed. Superb bar / library room with a good mixologist. In all fairness this library bar is one of the nicest areas of the hotel and it is worth a visit before heading out for the night, or a drink after a hard day seeing the city. There is also another main bar, and whilst it looks very cool its not terribly comfortable. If its a standing drink with friends you want however then it gets very busy on a friday and saturday night and plays some excellent music so definately worth checking out.

Our first room faced the road and there were road works all night (not that this was anything to do with the hotels its self). I called reception and they were great and agreed to move us to another room the next night. The next night alarms went in the middle of the night, we called reception and they assured us every thing was ok and to stay in the room. The night after that the air con stopped working and the room was like an oven, at 1.30am reception sent someone from maintenance to fix this. The night after that there was a party in the lobby which went to the wee hours in the morning. If you are a heavy sleeper then you will be fine at this hotel, not so good for light sleepers. If I was in NY again I would most likely stay upper east or west side where the accommodation is a little less costly as the subway is so easy and quick to get around in.

The average sized woman then was 4'11\" and weighed 82 pounds. That's what this dormitory was originally was built for. In 1997, Morgan Hotel company took over and added a new facade, paint, flooring, and some modern bath products and called it a \"boutique\" hotel. The rooms, bathrooms, showers, and toilets are miniature by today's standards. If you are over 5-feet tall, your knees will press into the wall in front of you when sitting on the toilet. I am attaching a photo of the toilet proximity to the wall. A coat hanger touching the wall is used for perspective. Note the tile is 4-inch tile. You have 10\" between the toilet seat and the wall. The front desk staff are friendly, but have no power to get anything done. Problems simply do not get resolved. I have always stated in previous reviews that problems happen at all levels of hotel. What sets quality hotels apart from poorly run hotels is the way hotel management deals with these issues. Unfortunately, the Hudson Morgan Hotel is apparently poorly managed because problems do not get resolved during one's stay. This is not atypical. If you read previous reviews, people who had a problem with this hotel were never satisfied with the resolution. Our problems included a thermostat that did not work and a bathroom sink that did not drain. The front desk said they would send an engineer to the room to fix \u2013 but three days later and as many calls later, nothing had been done. They also said they would relocate us to another room, but called us later in the day telling us that no other rooms were available. One common theme among approximately half of the reviews is that rooms were not ready upon check-in. We arrived at 8:30 PM. Although the hotel states that check-in time is at 3:00, our room was not ready at 8:30 PM. We waited an hour and a half before our room was ready for us to check in. (FYI - it had been booked three months prior). As you stand in the lobby and listen to the front desk staff speak to hotel guests, you'll continuously hear the words \"I'm sorry.\" This hotel is so old and in such bad need of renovation that virtually every room and every guest seems to have a problem. They are unable to react quickly enough to satisfy the guests. The renovation done in 1997 is showing its age. Additionally, it was a band-aid and not a deep bones renovation. This hotel still has the original 1927 plumbing, toilets, closets, and rooms. Remember, this was built as a dormitory for young women. When it was made into a hotel, it should have been completely redesigned. It wasn't, however. The structure/bones of the layout stayed the same. This hotel is a glorified hostel with nice bath products.

When the bellboy realised he wasn't getting a tip, he turned and stormed out of the room, slamming the door as he went. This is a place where the guys outside openly count their tips on the street and joke loudly about what they have, or haven't, been given. A bottle of wine we had requested in advance to be in the room wasn't there, there was nothing to drink - not even water. The room was small, dark, dingy and depressing, full of Ikea furniture. Large cracks in the ceiling looked like they had been plaster-filled by an child with no arms, and huge strands of dust blew in the breeze from the noisy air-conditioning unit. The bathroom turned into an ice rink within 30 seconds of the shower being turned on and paint was peeling from the radiator, which was stone-cold and full of air. But the best was still to come.

Note that another interesting feature of the hotel is the clear glass separating the shower from the bedroom. The window can be obscured by a thin curtain pulled from inside the shower. So yes - that brings up the bathroom... you can hardly move. Sitting on the toilet, your knees touch the wall. Interestingly enough, however, the amenities are pretty nice.

It is nice, clean, with trendy bars... steps away from the Time Warner center, Columbus Circle, Central Park, and lots of other sites in Midtown West. You can find nice restaurants, places to shop, and things to do. If you are looking for more of a gritty New York City feel (and maybe larger room), I might recommend going farther down into midtown (or lower) - even somewhere around Times Square or Rockefeller Plaza.

My room was paid upfront and on check in I was asked for a card, I was about to hand one over when I checked they would be ok with me settling the bill at the end in cash to avoid all the UK bank charges. At that point they admitted they we're going to put a charge on my card for $200, meaning that it would be unavailable to me whilst I was staying there. The worse this was there was nothing for me to spend it on, there's no minibar, room service and the bar was hired out for private use any time I wanted to use it. It was simply to cover any potential damage. As it was late at night I explained I would rather pay in cash to avoid the charges from my bank for their stupid poilcy and would drop it in the next day. Whe I did so I was told it was now $400, $100's deposit per night above and beyond the room rate. I explained that I had already been told $200 and wasn't prepared to give them $400. They finally gave way but it just seemed like a scam. This is an absurd policy for a hotel which charges $450 per night during the Christmas season, they should know better. My first room wasn't clean enough for a family B&B let alone a city hotel. With someone's hair throughout the bathroom (in sink/shower/shelf/soap dish etc), a bath lacking about 25% of it's enamel/paint and yellow grout on most of the tiles to name a few. As everyone has said the rooms are minuscule and this is from someone who has spent a fair amount of time in Tokyo. My first night had no WiFi but as I was there for work I explained this wasn't good enough. For my second to fourth nights I was moved to a room which was bigger, certainly a more reasonable size and seemingly cleaner. My first night in the new room the TV didn't work which was annoying. When raised with the front desk staff they were positively rude saying there was a problem with an upgrade of the service the previous day. No apology, I was simply expected to understand it didn't work, without a timeline for a resolution. Beyond the above: chuck in a rude bar staff member, bars closed for private hire most nights leaving nowhere for residents to drink despite limited other options nearby and an overall scruffy dated look to the rooms left me far from impressed. The only saving grace was the check out, some confusion about my deposit was handled competently and in a friendly manner (probably the first decent encounter with staff over my stay) a helpful bell boy/man and good door service with luggage and taxi's.

I rated the Hudson \"Very Good,\" but I would say my stay was actually \"Good.\" It was definitely better than \"Average.\" The Hudson is described as a boutique hotel and if boutique is a synonym for small than boutique it is :). Yes, my room was small and I could almost touch both walls while lying in the middle of my bed (Come to think of it, I actually may have), but saying that, the room was meticulously clean and it offered every amenity that I needed. The bathroom was fantastic, loved the shower! The maids who cleaned my room were wonderful! Other than the size of the room, my biggest complaint about the Hudson was the lobby. The lobby is nice, pretty, and spacious, but it is so disorganized! Everytime I entered the lobby and I needed to speak with the hotel staff, I never knew which queue to get in. There were queues all over the place and luggage all over the place as well. It just made for a disorganized scene and it doesn't have to be that way. But, once I spoke with the hotel staff regarding whatever question I had, they were very helpful and courteous. Location, location, location: The location of this hotel is fantastic! It is practically across the street from Central Park. I woke up and went running in Central Park every morning of my stay. The hotel is next to Columbus Circle and the Columbus Circle Subway. There is a shopping center by the Subway entrance with a Whole Foods Grocery in the basement, great place to get food. Plus, there are all kinds of cafes and restaurants within walking distance. Other: The exercise room was good offered everything that I needed: Free weights, treadmills, bikes etc. I found the elevators to be a bit slow, but it could just be due to the volume of people in the hotel. The hotel always seemed to be crowded. While in the elevator, I dug the music that was played and piped in throughout the hotel. I also like the fact the music that is played in the hotel is available online, nice touch. I liked the vibe of the hotel. There was a fun energy and it always seemed like there was something going on. Very easy hotel to access a taxi, plus the doormen were very helpful.

Before even returning, I had read the many poor reviews, and thought that people were exagerating - but it looks like people's issues have come to full fruition. Issues: 1. Television did not work the 1st evening. Had to go to front desk to have it serviced. 2. It took more than 60 minutes for my luggage to be delivered to my room upon arrival. 3. There was no hot water during the 1st day and therefore had to take a luke warm shower at 7:00 am. As you can imagine, not the most pleasant experience. Again informed front desk, and was resolved 4. The phones were erratic. The message indicator light was going on and off for no reason. 5. LAST morning, I took a bitterly cold shower at 4:30 in the morning!!! Not a sign of heat!!!! 6. Upon comparing notes, it sounds like my colleague's rooms did not have hot water as well! 7. Safe was missing in my colleague's room!?! To be frank with you, for the price point of this hotel, the amount was unjustifiable. Basic services such as hot water should not be optional. I actually accepted the small size of the room, but when it comes to basic ammenities, that's when I'm a bit perplexed. I am returning to NYC in December, and at this point I have no incentive to return to your hotel. I would live to hear the reasons behind my inconveniences. To be frank with you, I have read the poor reviews of the Hudson on tripadvisor. But unfortunately, if looks like your hotel is beginning to live up to its poor reputation. Sabrina from Customer Service contacted me, and informed me that there are a myriad of upgrades beginning in January. I have plans to return to NYC in December, and am very skeptical of the idea of returning to this hotel.

I let that go, but I've stayed at many boutique hotels and overly miniature living space is not a requirement. My main issue was the extremely poor soundproofing. From the 4th floor the street noise sounded as though the windows were wide open. The hotel is obviously aware of the issue as it leaves complimentary ear plugs in the room. However, the noise level was bad enough that these were insufficient and I managed little sleep. I would strongly recommend that any guest insist on a room on a much higher floor. Other issues were the shabbiness of the room. The built-in furniture had numerous dings and scratches that had not been re-painted or even sealed.

There is a garden bar directly behind the reception (which we didn't use) a 'Library' bar which provided a beer and a cocktail for $24 and the famous 'under floor lit' bar.

The room was small, as others have mentioned. I'm 5'6 and didn't struggle but my partner is 5'11 and had to shuffle about a bit! The bed was very comfortable and the room came with air conditioning as standard which was very handy. The room also came witha safe which was practical and easy to use (with instructions).

The manager in our NY office suggested the Hudson, so I called to make a reservation. First, I was quoted a rate that was significantly ABOVE their \"lowest rate\" on their website. Huh? What happened to this great rate? I worked with the reservation agent (who, to the company's credit, was very personable and professional) and finally found an acceptable rate for a standard room. The agent also asked if I had any requests. I specifically asked for a QUIET room. He was happy to oblige. So, I get to the hotel and there's no sign outside. I had to ask my driver several times if this was, indeed, a hotel. He chucked and said yes. I got out and was greeted by a guy in an overcoat. No uniform. I was thinking that this guy was maybe a bellman, maybe stealing my luggage. Whew. Bellman/Doorman. Okay. So up the chartreuse escalator I go. I looked at my sickly green tinted hands (bad lighting) and had a bad feeling. I arrived at the impressive lobby--huge desk, indoor foliage...it looked like a park in the lobby. However, it was as dark as a park in the middle of the night. Small spotlights lit up the front desk personnel like eerie ghost-receptionists. I walked up to the desk and was greeted warmly. I then went through the check-in process and was duly informed that they would be charging $200 on my card as \"security\" for incidentals. Um, what? I was \"assured\" that if I didn't go beyond my \"expected\" bill, that the charge would be refunded. Um, what? You're charging my card for an amount I haven't spent and may not spend? Okay... Anyway, I got my room key and went up to my room. I walked in to a very funky, tiny, wood-paneled room. I have stayed in NY hotels before, but this was small for even those standards. But okay, it was clean. Kind of tired and old, but clean. The desk? Totally Ikea, as was the rest of the decor. However, the issue was the noise. I was in a corner room on the 6th floor on a busy street. And the windows wouldn't close. This was about as far from quiet as one could get. I might as well have been sleeping on a balcony. I go down to the front desk, and they said that they would have to send engineering with a special \"key\" to close the windows. WhatHUH? Yes, people cannot shut a window by themselves at this hotel. You need an engineer. So the engineer gets there. There is NO key. He has a hammer and a screwdriver and POUNDS the window shut. It was broken. But even shut, the noise is...well, pretty darn bad. So I call down to the front desk and state that I was specifically asked if I had a special request and stated that I wanted a quiet room. \"That's not guaranteed.\" Okay, so did you check if there was a room on the inside of the hotel? No. So they check, and voila, there is! Would they send up the key? NO. We're too busy. Sorry, you have to come down and get it. So I do. And when I get down there, the front desk has NO idea what I'm talking about and I have to explain all over again. And I'm again admonished for NOT knowing that a request is not something that they really can fulfill. And even though they had a quiet room, it wasn't really something that they could fulfill??? Okay. So up to the 2nd room I go. I walk in. It's smaller than the first one, if that's possible. Yes, it is. But it's so small that there is NOWHERE to put my clothes. No bureau. NO CLOSET. NO HANGERS. NO IRON or BOARD. Now I'm angry. I call down and speak to a manager and give him HELL. WTF? No closet? In a hotel? What...do they rent this room by the hour?? I relay my disgust, dismay and total fatigue. I had been traveling all day, hadn't eaten and was about at the end of my rope. So he \"upgrades\" me to a larger room AND sends up a key. And who delivers it? The gal that was \"too busy\" before. HA. So I get to the next (and final) room. It's quite (on the garden side of the hotel). It has two double beds and a small sitting area. Apparently, this is a gargantuan suite in their minds. To me, it's about the size of a NORMAL hotel room anywhere, and smaller than most in NYC. But it's quite, it has a closet and a TV and a safe. Finally. So, I'm sure that others have had better experiences. I did not. I won't be back, Sabrina (Guest Relations Manager), so don't ask me to \"give you another chance.\" I won't. And I'll make sure that my company doesn't try to place other people in your service hell-hole and hobbit-sized rooms.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cNeeds improvement\u201d", "Author": "gnolect", "ReviewID": "UR119512352", "Content": "Super small rooms, but that is not unusual for a city.

Reception refused to do anything and basically told us to eat the cost. It was more about the principle then the extra cost. 2. No such thing as non smoking since they don't care if of other customers are smoking on a non smoking floor! Reception said they would look into it but through out the week we stayed there we can smell the smoke. 3. After arriving we had to wait 4 hours before we were able to check in to our room. We arrived at the hotel at 1pm. After waiting the 4 hours they gave our rooms away and gave us different rooms on the same floor, why we had to wait 4 hours is beyond me especially if our room was given to someone else. 4. Managers asked if we were happy and when we told them about our problem we were offered late check out by 4pm. Great our flight was for 11am so I'm not sure how that helps... So on to the good: 1. cleaning service and room service staff were wonderful! 2. Great location We booked 2 rooms with 4 adults, we've all been to NYC before and stayed at various other hotels without the horrible service received at this hotel by front desk and managers. We gave a negative feed back on the survey they sent to us but no response from management at all. So trust us when we say this hotel doesn't care about your or it's service level!

This hotel is in an ideal location, a 5 - 10 minute walk to Times Square, with many bars, diners, shops and restaurants surrounding it. Upon arrival (around 4.30pm) we were served straight away by a friendly receptionist, who gave us our room card and my request of being on the highest floor possible (23rd) had been granted. I was asked to give my card to keep on record in case of damage to the room etc. I was not aware of this and did not have the money on my card, however, I asked if I could leave a cash deposit and this was fine. The Room: Off we went to our hotel room, in preparation for it to be so tiny we couldn't move, I must of had one of the larger standard rooms and it was a comfortable fit for 2. however it is a small room, but your only there to sleep and get ready right? The beds were clean, the rooms smelt fresh and well aired and the bathroom was fully stocked with towels, toilet paper, soap, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and a small hairdryer on the back of the door (which came in useful when my hairdryer was too powerful for the voltage)The bathroom is VERY small though and I am not sure you can call the bath a bath, I don't think the Hudson do though. We used all the towels daily which were replaced everyday, along with any of the complimentary toiletries. The room is quirky but simple. One thing that did annoy me with the room is the humming from the air conditioning unit behind the bed, however, I did not notice this at all when I came back after a day of sightseeing and neither did my friend. The roof terrace: It took us three days to get here as we had been so busy experiencing NYC, however when we got to the terrace it took our breathe away. I highly recommend taking a visit here at night. The skyline of NYC is lit up. Try a cucumber cooler ($16 - But tasty), a Grolsch will set you back about $12 but this can slightly be justified because it is a large bottle. OK so the prices are Expensive, but grab your drinks look at the skyline and it is worth it. The Lobby and Garden Bar: 1st night, this was empty, glowing lights but no customers or staff. We did go back a second time however the barman was more interested in lighting candles then serving, so we went outside to the garden bar. Raining but comfortable as half is protected by shelter. Same prices apply here but the cucumber cooler was not as good :-( 13th Floor....? There is no 13th Floor? I am still confused by this. Internet cafe/business center: Fancy paying $7.95 by card only, for 15 min use on the net...I didn't either. However this allows me to mention one perfect helper at the Hudson. After walking out of the business centre, we decided to ask where a certain restaurant was at reception. We were welcomed by the most helpful guy ever called LARRY! He was able to hunt down the hotel for us, also helped us when it came to late check out. He was friendly, helpful and a true credit to the Hudson Hotel. 5*s just for him,thank you so much larry..... and also a thank you to MATTHEW at the concierge desk who called our transfer shuttle to locate them as they were late.

She gave us the rack rate, at $250/night and suggested we call Reservations or look online for a better deal. (We originally booked the rooms on hotels.com for $170/night only 1 day before checking-in) so we went upstairs to the room and began searching. Reservations quoted us $450/night, and we couldn't find any cheaper online so we returned back downstairs to book the $250/night. It's a Monday, so we were hoping for a better rate but oh well. The Front Desk agent tells us \"Sorry, the price has gone up to $450/night. There's nothing we can do about it\" Of course we requested to speak to a Manager since less than an hour ago she had suggested we call Reservations , only to lose out on the original price. Why hadn't SHE offered to call Reservations for us in the first place?! The agent called a Manager, and a quick \"no\" was the final answer. Why did no manager show-face? It's 2 am, he's on shift, I imagine not too busy...maybe eating a donut in the back?? It's in his job description to address concerns of all guests. Here's the kicker: When we asked if there was anything they could offer, the agent responded \"Well it's not like you come here often.\" !!! Are you kidding me? It's our second time at this hotel, and we've just been told that we are not \"regulars\" enough for being considered a discount, which translates to we don't deserve good customer service. Did she forget how a clientele is created?? First impressions and keeping the customers happy. That's a no-brainer. Wow. Not to appear snobby, but I've worked in 5 star hotels at the Front Desk and that is definitely not how the management or the representative would handle this situation.

To my surprise the two female clerks and one male manager hid behind the corporate curtain instead of giving true customer service (i.e. the computers are not set up for this and we've never done this type of thing before). For me customer service starts when the customer has a problem ( reasonable, not outrageous) and is taken care of in a expedient and reasonable manner. The personnel previously mentioned failed miserably and willfully, a solution was availiable, but they refused to take the time to deal with it. Finally, the second day I spoke to a female manager and she took care of my concern right away without any hesitation-- and she is to be commended. So if I am a \"guest\" with a reasonable problem, (which mine was) I feel I should be given a reasonable solution by any of the staff, after all thats what customer service is, and this is a 4 star hotel.

What stricken us was that the room was dark and ageing. the bathroom was kind of sad. the paint was clearly not white anymore, the drains did not work properly and the floor tiles seemed to be 50 years old.... another issue is the AC. we had to turn it off in order to sleep. but again, we europeans, are less used to AC in our bedrooms. the safe in our room had a dysfunction and I could never get the front desk to fix it. we received a bottle of sparkling wine when they learned we just got married and we were touched by the nice thought. the concierge was very efficient and gave very good advice about restaurants. don't buy show tickets through them as their broker will rip you off. we had breakfast once in the hotel. the restaurant is worth a visit. we did not go to the club and we were never disturbed by it (we wre on the 12th floor). there is a wonderful rooftop. in the end the best thing about the hotel is its location just 3 minutes away from central park, close to broadway, close to a tube station. i would say that i was a bit disappointed by the rooms but hey, this is NY, so basically you're never in your room!! you can stay at this hotel and be out all day and then enjoy the restaurant and bar/club or the rooftop on a sunny day. you just need not to be too demanding on the quality of the rooms.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milton Keynes, UK", "Title": "\u201cStylish but quite dim round the edges\u201d", "Author": "Dawn_MK", "ReviewID": "UR117752865", "Content": "I stayed here just before thanksgiving last year and wasn't expecting the Ritz due to reviews I read.

She cheerfully assured us that we were and began a first-class, professional check-in. She already had me on her team. I asked about the bed situation, since I knew from my Priceline.Com confirmation that we were booked in a double bed. We were promptly upgraded to a queen size bed at no extra charge.

If we had any bags, we would have been tripping over them, and there was hardly any place to have done any unpacking. Also, there is a funky setup with the bathroom, where one wall of the bathroom is glass, fronting on the bedroom.

We stayed here because it was close to our wedding venue in Central Park. On first arrival it is very hard to tell that it is the Hudson hotel with no visible markings or signs outside. Then you are greeted with huge glass doors which open the wrong way for pulling luggage through. Then the escalators and green glow of the paint and lighting which make it feel like you are entering a cinema or shopping centre. The entire hotel lobby is cloaked in fake ivy making it incredibly dark, even in the midday sun. There are lots of little nooks and crannies and comfy chairs which always seemed to contain someone asleep in them (no suprise considering the consistent darkness!) The staff were very polite and helpful although my parents had to wait 4 hours for their room the be ready. The biggest suprise and indeed dissapointment came when we got to our room. To say the room was shoe box like was an understatement. It consisted of a narrow corridor into the room with a hanging rail for clothes and then basically a bed, a small walkway around the bed with a desk at the end and then a glass wall which was the back of the shower! The bathroom was ridiculously small and it would be true to say that knees touched the wall whilst on the lavatory!. The shower consisted of a small tray and two curtains, one for the inside of the bathroom and one to cover the glass wall in the bedroom. The whole hotel continued to be cloaked in darkness and whilst the bar lounge was a little more illuminated, the price for a bottle of corona or any beer left jaws on the floor. $18 for 2 drinks and then tip meant that each time $20 lighter in the wallet! Then there was the noise from the disco on Fridays and Saturdays. To say we were on the 11th floor the music and talking was crystal clear! Seems like I am complaining about most things but it was a very dissapointing experience for our wedding and honeymoon. The place was clean and tidy and the staff were polite and helpful and if you like living like a mole person in perpetual darkness then this is the place for you!

It is a fantastic space, though the bar service is outrageously expensive. There was a wide range of people staying at the hotel, many attractive young couples, many international, some families. Not so many business guests. My first night I did not sleep well. The AC was right in back of the bed and kept cycling on and off.

I wonder how they would accommodate two twin beds in a room this size which is less then 8 by 8. We had a full size bed in our room and bumped our heads so many times to the television screen that is mounted on the wall. Yes, there is no space to place anything on the ground except for the bed and a very small table. Third, this is what got me...the wall separating the bathroom from the main room is plain transparent glass which means you can actually look right into the bathroom. There is no question of having a private moment in the bathroom or on the toilet as we can see you even if you turn off the light! That might take a bit of getting used to for people who like their privacy in the bathroom. Fourth, There is no counter space in the bathroom and the sink is a corky little deep basin which is cute to see but just not practical. There is really NO space to keep anything so you will have to leave things on the floor.

Service is satisfactory and unobtrusive. In fact you hardly see any staff. The completely unmanned business centre is a real eyeopener , especially in comparison to India where a dedicated staff would cater to the needs of the guest. The single room is too small and a solo guest is advised to take a double room. The room is extremely comfortable with modern interiors with warm wooden paneling on walls. the staff at the reception desk was extremely efficient and helpful attending to all my needs from changing the room after check in at a attractive rate, I only wish my request for an early check in was also taken care of , as spending 6 hours sitting in the lobby after a 20 hour flight was a torture.

New York has too many fantastic restaurants to eat in the hotel, so I have not rated the restaurant. Fair is fair. Also the entire hotel is as near to pitch black as possible, you literally can't see 5 feet in front because the lights are so low. The outdoor patio is lovely and a great place to chill even if you can't get the wifi to work. The bar inside is about as funky as it gets. Friday and Saturday nights are the big nights. Another word of warning, the patio club will be blasting music until 11-12 every night. So don't expect any quiet before these times. This place is great for jet set clubbers (I used to be one).

After ten hours in the airport, we were looking forward to getting back to a hotel. When we arrived at the Hudson, we weren't even sure it was a hotel. Take heed - the building that looks and sounds like a night club is actually the hotel. The lobby and elevator area is very, very dark and loud. There is a huge front desk, but it seems only to be staffed by one or two people. The lines to check in and out were very long. The concierge desk was very helpful. The room was tiny.

The air conditioner was quite loud, but it turned out to be a good thing. If it hadn't been, the noise from the music from the courtyard or the roof would probably keep you awake.

The hotel does not provide them. Each morning we were there, the door was opened by housekeeping while we were in bed. There was a brief knock, and then the door opened.

I made the reservation on Priceline, but could have booked for the same price via the Hudson website. Using the Hudson website, I emailed asking if would be possible to get a room higher up for our anniversary. I got no response, so I emailed again with the same result. I was expecting the hotel to say it was not possible, but to ignore me was impolite. I ended up getting in contact with a manager who went above and beyond expectations, setting aside room 1448 (on the 14th floor) and even sent an anniversary gift for us. Now for the room: Everything was very clean (and my wife does check EVERYTHING). The towels each had small stains on them, which I didn't even notice, but my wife did and housekeeping promptly brought 4 new, clean towels. The room wasn't large, but was definitely big enough for the two of us and the two suitcases, neither of which would be considered \"carry-on\" size for an airline. There are modern, artsy \"reading\" lights on either side of the bed and a long light behind the headboard. There were mirrors on either side of the bed, with a flat panel Sony tv on one side. There was a small desk, chair and lamp at the end of the bed. And here's the interesting part - dividing the bed area and the bathroom is a floor-to-ceiling glass panel. There are curtains on either side, but if both are open, you have a full view of the shower from the bed. There was also a small closet with hangers, an iron, and small ironing board. We had free wifi in the room. It wasn't fast, but to quickly check email or find a phone number/address, it was great. There is an option to pay to upgrade the speed. Each time you connect it lasts 24 hours, but you can just connect again for free every 24 hours if you need. The hotel: We didn't do much in the hotel other than sleep and relax during the day for a bit. Everything was very clean and the bars/restaurants looked interesting. We did have a drink on the Sky Terrace one evening with each drink being $16. The drinks were fine, the view and chairs were great. There was loud music on the Sky Terrace probably starting at 10 pm (I'm not sure, I don't think we were ever there when it started), but it did end around midnight. The one night we went to bed before midnight, we had no trouble falling asleep with the music going. Although if you are a very light sleeper, maybe you ask for a room further from the Sky Terrace. Lastly, the hallways were a bit dated and dirty feeling, but I don't sleep or relax in the hall, so I didn't care. Location: We've never stayed on the West Side, but the the hotel is very close to plenty of things. The closest \"attractions\" would be the Columbus Circle/Time Warner Center and Central Park. There's a Whole Foods in the Time Warner Center and another grocery store about 1 block east if you want to picnic. There's a Duane Reade pharmacy also about 1 block east. There are plenty of subway lines available at Columbus Circle and there's another stop at 57th and 7th (N, Q, R I think - maybe just N and R). There's a Starbucks, Pinkberry and Subway all no more than 2 blocks east, and plenty of local places just as close, including Sushi Damo and a cafe or three (Coloseum, Europan). Overall a great stay.

There are a few tips and tricks to be aware of when booking which I will detail below but here's an overview of the hotel. Hudson Hotel is a trendy modern hotel which although is a bit on the under-lit side is very atmospheric and cool. The reception staff were very friendly and efficient at both check-in and check-out. The concierge next to reception was very helpful and answered all of our questions and helped us when booking transportation to the airport. The hotel also offered complimentary bag storage when we wanted to go and do some sightseeing on our last day after we had checked out. The hotel is very close to a main subway junction (Columbus Circle) meaning it is very easy to get around the city. It is also near to Central Park which is an added bonus. There is a pool table in the library which is free for guests to use, plus there are plenty of comfy sofas and armchairs and a couple of chess sets. We didn't go to the bars or restaurant but did make use of the Sky Terrace on the 15th floor which was a great place to have breakfast in the morning or chill out in the evening after a hard days sightseeing. The hotel has a well equipped gym but no swimming pool despite what you might read elsewhere. Our superior queen room was a good size (not huge but in keeping with every other major city I've been to). It was cleaned and tidied daily and the bed was remade which was great to come back to in the evenings, plus there was a hairdryer and shower amenities which were restocked each day. There were no tea and coffee making facilities which was disappointing but the TV and stereo CD player worked well. There was also an ice dispenser on each floor which was useful. The room was fully air conditioned which kept it nice and cool despite the 30 degree heat outside. I would highly recommend this hotel but would ask people to bear a few things in mind before booking; - Don\u2019t book a standard room, but rather go for a superior or deluxe room (the cost is a little higher but you'll be glad of it when you get there!). We were in a superior queen which was a perfect size for 2 people of average height. - Request a room on the highest floor possible in the hotel (floors 19-24 are best - we were on the 23rd floor), so as to be as far away from the street noise and music from the bars downstairs. - Email the hotel in advance to request a room on the highest floor possible - DO NOT bother with the main email webform via the Morgans Hotel Group website (we got no reply), instead try the Hudson Hotel manager Fady Awad at fady.awad@morganshotelgroup.com - he was very helpful. - Book online via the Hudson Hotel website directly rather than using a third party company as these companies select the cheapest standard rooms which are very small (hence the number of negative reviews on the Trip Advisor website). We managed to get 20% off the room price online as a special deal if we paid upfront. This made the check-in and check-out much quicker too. If you follow this advice you are more likely to have a pleasant stay at the Hudson Hotel.

Even the quieter \"library\" bar has a nice atmosphere, and you can go into the outside courtyard and enjoy some drinks; it was a nice day and we sat out there for awhile. There is also a terrace on the 15h floor which is great to hang out. So as far as things to do at the hotel, you can't really beat the Hudson. Now as far as the rooms go, oh boy....we had a regular room which was the lowest according to the prices. This room is tiny...yes, I know about NYC hotels and been to dozens, but this is TINY. We could deal with that, but in the end, for a fancy hotel like the Hudson, it just seemed kind of badly put together. There was only one electrical outlet on one side of the bed, not the other. The small flat screen TV is hanged on the wall and next to the bed; if you're on the side of the bed closest to the TV you can't even see the screen. The bathroom has one of those glass walls where you can see a person taking a shower, which a lot of boutique hotels have a we always like that touch. Problem is...the toilet is right there too b/c the bathroom is so small...kind of awkward. The A/C unit is directly behind the bed, so it's either freezing or warm. The closest is tiny.

I can see how not everyone would appreciate visiting the hotel only to lose creature comforts like a plush rug or a high, cushy bed. But that is what I love about it. I love the details that make your eyes wander around the lobby, made me curious to flip over everything in the room, and made me appreciate how different this hotel was. In fact, it felt like my bizarro New York apartment that was dark and smoldery, but had key design features like a window between the bed and bathtub, or a hot silver desk with a clear plexi chair. I\u2019ve stayed here 4 times now and no two room layouts have been the same reinforcing the idea that this was an old New York building converted to a modern hotel. I really dig this contrast aesthetically, but psychologically, it also makes me feel comfortable because it feels more like a pied a terre. The location also works for me because I\u2019m a regular in NY and I didn\u2019t need a central location to the tourist spots, but its location is very convenient to public transportation making it easy for me to get around. However, while I love it, not everyone will. It is dark and minimal and some rooms are quite small even for NY standards. It also lacks the convenience of a fridge in the room and doesn\u2019t have the best temperature control. While staying there in the winter my heater wouldn\u2019t shut off making it unbearably hot. Surprisingly, there is such a thing when the temperature outside is in the single digits. Another gripe is that the sheets are not uber soft, or a million thread count with the fluffiest goose down feather pillows. The elevators are sloooowwwww. I will admit the hotel is not perfect.

The location is great and the sky terrace is both beautiful and well designed for accommodating individuals and groups. It was nice to spend some time in the morning just lounging up there. The other bars are also quite nice. But the front desk area is a poorly designed. Its an incredibly wide check-in desk with little direction. Even though there were only several people waiting, it took surprisingly long to get through check in and everyone seemed generally confused about how to form up and where to go. Not really a good impression. Then, for whatever reason, only two of the five elevators were running, so the back was ridiculous (add at least one wedding reception to the congestion). Thankfully we were only a few floors up so we walked it, but I felt back for those on the 20+ floors. When we finally got to our room (a deluxe king), we turned right around because it was a smoking room. Not only did it reek of smoke, there was also an ashtray on the night stand. Later we found out from a doorman that the fifth floor is smoking. With the only remaining availability left, they upgraded us to a deluxe studio that still needed to be cleaned (so we didn't get into the room till after dinner), but they did give us two complimentary drinks for their bars which was nice. So despite the wrong room, the front desk handled it well. The room itself was alright. The wood walls are beautiful, but the furniture (two chairs and a sofa for the studio) is clearly for decoration only as they are ridiculously uncomfortable. Also, its odd that there were no lights (overhead or lamp) in the living room section of the room. So while I probably wouldn't have spent the morning reading on the couch because of how uncomfortable it is, I couldn't have simply because of poor lighting. I also thought the bed was pretty uncomfortable. One last thing. The fire alarm in our room started making very loud noises about 2am. I called down to the front desk to explain that it wasn't flashing but randomly beeping very loudly, perhaps because the battery was dying, and they said they'd send someone up. At 245am, after no one had come, I called back down and they reported that apparently someone was setting off false fire alarms on several floors. Thankfully it stopped randomly beeping, but it was frustrating that they neither came up to check (after they said they would) nor that they called back to explain the situation. Overall, the interaction with the staff was generally good. The front desk and the bellmen did what they could. It would've been nice if the guys working in the luggage storage would have told us they close up at 9pm and you have to use the bellmen out front (since we had to drop our bags off when we headed out for dinner). Also, I was a bit surprised to see two of the guys working in the luggage storage argue in front of a number of guests instead of dealing with their disagreements more discreetly. Since working at a luxury boutique hotel in Seattle, I recognize that sometimes things happen, but in this case, too many things did.

The hotel was unable to move us to a quieter room even though I had requested a quiet room in the booking. We were offered a room change the following day, but we had too much baggage to want to move. The hotel had a serious lack of staff the weekend that we were there. At times there was only 1 person at the front desk and several people waiting to check-in. There was also no one at the concierge desk. We called from our room with a request for the concierge but we just got the voicemail and finally we had to come down ourselves to the desk. There was still no concierge available and we had to queue at the front desk for assistance. The hotel needs to resolve its staffing issues. Another negative point about the hotel is that the wireless internet is not free. Surely modern hotels should know by now that customers expect free wifi.

It was not just us, most of the guests in the lobby were being told the same thing, with the excuse being that \"the hotel was full last night\". Ummmm, aren't hotels supposed to be able to plan for that eventuality and staff accordingly? I've checked into sold out hotels many times and never had to wait for my room for this reason. And the front desk staff were very rude about this, and in general - during our visit my room key stopped working and I went down to the front desk to have the issue corrected, and was told by the clerk that I was mistaken as to which room I was staying in and that's why the card wasn't working (turned out I was right and she was just an idiot). The hotel works hard at being hip and modern, and I think they cater to that crowd. I noticed a lot of the other guests were european tourists (with the accompanying hygiene and personal space issues). There isn't even a sign out front letting you know where it is, kind of an \"if you don't know we are here, we don't want you here\" kind of thing, very funny and very New York hipster. Now, onto the room - we paid $250 per night for the privilege of staying in a closet big enough to hold a bed and a bathroom. Now, I get that this is NYC so prices will be up there. Also, if they are catering to the tourist crowd, it makes sense to have small rooms since they will mostly be using the rooms just to sleep and get cleaned up (or not, see the \"european tourist\" part). So, if you are looking for a place in the city that provides a room you can relax in, don't stay here. If you like effective air conditioning in your room, don't stay here.

When we arrived at 2 am after a lot of traveling, I was shown to my room. The room was a smoking room (see above). I called the front desk to explain the mistake and he said they had no other rooms (pushy with this). I would not take this answer, so after 15 minutes of arguing he finally found another room . The next room, not sure if this was better or worse was the singular loudest place I have ever stayed. The room was located on the 6th floor (643) and was directly outside from the ventilation shaft, I am not exaggerating when I say it sounded like we were sleeping in a helicopter. I woke up with a massive headache and did not sleep much that night due to the noise. The headache and sleep deprivation greatly affected my meetings the next day. When I woke up in the morning I tried to use the phone to get breakfast/ switch rooms, but it didn\u2019t work?

Yes, that's a harsh opening statement. But it is also a true one. If you get the chance to read the other reviews for this hotel you'll notice it is a common theme, so isn't just me who has had a bad experience. First off, I'll start with a positive. This hotel does have the odd redeeming feature. From the outside it looks smart. You enter through the door and go up an escalator into one of the most amazing (if dark) lobby's I've ever seen. It's smart. Trendy. It's dark, so you may feel like you are walking into an Abercrombie store. The Library is fantastic. Amazingly flash room. The Dining Room (apologies if I got the name wrong) is brilliant. They project sports onto the walls in the morning - lovely touch. And the outside bar is great with oversized plant pots and plenty of seats to enjoy a beer whilst taking in NYC. OK. Positives out of the way. Let's get onto the meat. 1. Check In Massive queues with no staff to open more lines. And not just on the day we checked in. Every day, without fail, there would be queues of people 6/7 deep waiting to check in. The group of people I was with checked in at 3.30pm after a long flight from Europe. Despite check-in advertised from 3pm, there room wasn't made available until after 5pm. Oddly they made us wait in the bar without any complimentary drinks! Cher-ching to the Hudson. 2. Lifts It's a big hotel with 23 floors, but the lifts are woefully inadequate. Expect to have a good wait, especially when heading down to the lobby. Obviously I don't expect them to build in a new lift shaft to help with demand, but it's worth being aware of. 3. The Rooms This is the biggie. I've been to NYC a couple of times before and I don't expect big rooms. Not at all. This is New York after all. HOWEVER.. the rooms in the Hudson Hotel are ridiculous. I didn't take a tape measure with me.. can't think why, but I'd estimate the sleeping area (with bed, desk & chair) to be 3m squared. The bathroom is the worst. Good luck trying to sit on the toilet without your legs squeezing between the toilet and wall. Sure I'm a guy and I'm tall. But my wife isn't and she had to sit at an angle just to use the facilities. The shower and basin however are nice and the overall aesthetics of both rooms are nice. 4. Noise Again this is NYC so I was expecting noise, however the windows offer very little protection from the outside noise. There was little persevable difference in noise level with the window open or closed. Thursday, Friday & Saturday nights are the worst. One of the bars downstairs turns into a club open to the public. I'm sure it's lovely and trendy. However the noise gets even worse with music and people audible until after 2am. I was on the 7th floor but colleagues were on the 15th and could still hear the noise. 5. Service The staff are rude, unhelpful and care little for the residents of the hotel. One example, even though we had left our towels out to be changed, it didn't happen for 3 days. We even went to reception one lunchtime and asked them if housekeeping could send new ones. They said yes they would be sent straight away but no towels arrived until the following morning. The staff continue to have conversations with each other, rather than helping out. We even had someone chase after us because they weren't satisfied with the tip we had give them. Sure, I could probably have tipped more but I tip when I receive good service. 6. Food The food we had (breakfast) and room service was nice. The room service number didn't pick up one night when calling for 20 minutes. We called the front desk and was told someone would call us back. They didn't. No surprise. The pizza on the room service was deliciousness, however breakfast is incredibly expensive for what it is. Breakfast for 2 cost us $73. Just pop outside for a Starbucks instead.

He wanted to make sure that I would be happy with it - he liked what he saw on the hotel's website and admittedly at first, so did I. However, after reading the many posts on TripAdvisor, I learned the reality of exactly what to expect of the hotel but I didn't ask him to change the reservation, which ended up being a mistake. My worst fears were realized upon check-in despite the effort of emailing the hotel manager before we left (fady.awad@morganshotelgroup.com) who had replied to some of the TripAdvisor posts advising people to contact him prior to their arrival to make arrangements for an appropriately sized room. I never heard back from him so we did end up getting stuck with a room that was the smallest I've ever seen, with a bathroom that my 6'3\" man couldn't even turn around in. He ended up having to use the facilities down on the main floor for all 5 days we were there because he simply could not fit into the bathroom. The only redeeming quality about the room was that it was clean. They didn't have any other rooms available except for a smoking room, which I won't stay in because of the smell. Another undesirable part of the hotel is the constant loud music and partying taking place in the bar, lobby, elevators, even outside in front of the hotel. If I was in my early 20s, sure, it probably would be fun. But I'm not, so it wasn't. Their website shows a tranquil looking \"Private Park\" located outside the lobby... in reality it's loud, crowded and very dark. The staff was rude for the most part, except for one helpful guy at the concierge desk. And after spending $80 on 4 drinks (yes, FOUR drinks cost EIGHTY dollars with tip) in the Library, we would expect to be able to relax and enjoy them rather than being told shortly after that they were closing and rudely being asked to finish up and leave. Seriously. It was rather unbelievable and beyond disappointing. So in short, don't bother contacting the hotel manager before you go because based on my experience, it's an exercise in futility, and don't go by what their website shows or you'll be very disappointed.

We moved rooms but that obviously meant packing all our stuff etc and going to 1627, that process lost us a couple of hours. The second room seemed fine, no issues on the noise. But the air con was not working. Called the front desk and said we were going out, but they said they would have it sorted when we got back. All that was sorted when we got back was that our room keys weren't working! So complained about the air con again and someone from engineering arrived, flicked a switch outside apparently and bingo, it was working. Went out that night, came back, no air con! Called front desk, said they would send someone up but no one came, slept okay, but a bit hot and humid.

However, given that the Hudson is part of the Morgans Group - the same group that own the Sanderson and St Martin's Lane in London - I had good expectations. Sadly, the expectations didn't last long. I arrived and had to wait almost 20 minutes to check-in. Given there are over 800 rooms in this hotel (yes, you read that correctly), the fact they only had 2 staff working on the front desk is just ridiculous. Clearly this is an issue as this complaint comes up time and time again, so you would think the management would read the feedback and employ more staff - clearly not. Room was bearable, but only because we upgraded to a junior suite, which was passable in size. That said, it's the smallest suite I've ever stayed in!! I know others who stayed in the regular rooms, and they are TINY! If there are over 800 rooms, the hotel should knock some rooms together and give people more space. In terms of the amenities in the room, the storage space was minimal - one rail, and a storage stack unit with 4 compartments. Hardly adequate for a suite with two occupants. Also a mini-bar, but no fridge........HUH?? No tea/coffee facilities either - for a hotel of this standard, that is rubbish! Maintenance of the room was poor - the light stand didn't work, some of the wood panelling was coming away, and the cleanliness of the room was poor also- LOTS of dust. Bathroom was small also, with a tiny bath/shower. Putting a shelf unit over the WC basin is NOT a good idea, especially when things fall off - clearly the designer of this layout didn't consider this. The hallways of the hotel are very dark, poorly maintained/decorated and look in serious need of a refresh. The lobby and entrance are made to look glamorous and certainly have a bit of the \"WOW\" factor, but once you're past the Reception area, it's all downhill. I avoided the restaurant - $29 for a breakfast isn't exactly my idea of value - and the club on the lobby floor level turns the venue into a nightclub at weekends. Great if that's what you're after - not so great if you want something a bit more refined and stylish.

The TV is hung on the wall and my daughter kept hitting her head on the TV when she stood up out of bed. The closet is ok but the bathroom is basically 3 feet by 6 feet, including the shower, toilet and sink area. A very large person would have trouble maneuvering in there. Sometimes I could hear dripping water at night which was annoying but the bed was comfortable enough. The main desk area is dark but nice with an arched roof and ivy growing up and across.

Having never been to NY, I wasn't sure what location would be best. After looking at tons of hotels, reviews and prices, I booked this hotel via Priceline. I became very leery after reading all of the bad reviews, but I have to say, upon arriving, that I was pleasantly surprised. This hotel is very close to Central Park and easily walkable to Times Square. There's a great cafe right around the corner where we had delicious croissants and coffee. Granted, most of the reviews are based in truth but you have to take everything with a grain of salt. Yes, the hotel lobby and hallways are very dark, but you can see the numbers in the elevator. The hallways could definitely use a renovation - carpet is old and stained and looks dingy. We found the hotel staff and the doormen to be very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. We asked for a later check out and had no problems whatsoever. The guests did appear to be mostly european and younger and there is a nightclub with very loud music, but we were on the 12th floor, so it didn't affect us. I would definitely have been upset if our room were closer to the club noise. The room is indeed tiny, but we managed just fine. I read some postings about the window from the bathroom to the room - there's another curtain you can close and it blocks your view and gives the person complete privacy. We had no issue with that at all. We had a closet to hang our clothes, but no drawers. For our needs, it was fine. I wouldn't want to stay in the room for a long period of time; it's very small. Applying makeup was a little difficult outside of the bathroom (I agree the hairdryer was fabulous -best one I've used!) For us, the bottom line is - we came to NY to see the city, not to sit in our hotel room. The hotel is in a great location, the garden area/bar was beautiful to sit in and have a drink, the staff was very friendly.

Read lots of reviews online about this hotel and generally the reviews were \"its ok\" and this was very much my experience. We arrived at around lunchtime, check in was painless and pretty quick and we were welcomed with a smile. The reception area is a bit dark but it goes with the whole atmosphere of the place. We got into our room on the 23rd floor (highly recommend getting as high as possible to ensure you manage to get some sleep). We got into the room and on the face of it seemed clean and good. The bed was made nicely and was well equipped with TV, small desk and air conditioning. Problem with the AC is that it was rather loud, if it was summer I wouldnt want to try and sleep as it was that loud! On further inspection of the room there was quite a bit of dust under the bed, also on the desk chair and it could of done with some tidying up of cables and general freshening up. As we were on the 23rd floor no window to open and it did smell a bit musty when we first got into the room. Downside of the room is that there is no wardrobe, there is a rail to hang things but having no door on it seems to me to be an oversight. The shower room was not great, again on the face of it the seemed clean but on further inspection the grout on the tile floor in the shower area was cracked and the last time they used sealant on the joins it was done belry messily and wasnt to the standard I would expect of any hotel. The biggest problem was fruit flies or bar flies that were in the shower area. No more than half a dozen, we told the guys at reception and housekeeping was sent up. The next day the flies were back and I killed a couple every morning. I guess they came from the drains. When we checked out they did wipe of some charges for internet and phone calls which they didnt have to do so that was a plus. The location was great, 15 mins walk to Times Sq, 5 mins walk to Central Park and a subway station (Columbus Circle) 5 mins from the hotel as well so you are no more than 30 mins from Financial District. Also for the locations and price it was one of the cheapest in the area. Overall as I didnt spend all that much time in the Hotel the stay was fine, but no better than that. The room was on the small side but the bed was comfortable. We were there to see the sites and we did loads of walking, by the time we got back to the hotel we were too tired to check out the bar so if you are looking for a hotel with a cool bar next door this might be the place.

Upon arrival you realise how dark the hotel is however you initially forgive it as it is undeniably stylish. At check in we arrived early (pre 3pm)and did the paperwork and checked in our bags leaving us time to explore NY whilst we waited for our room to be ready. When we arrived back to collect the key we had a small wait as reception was busy but we got the key and peceded to our room to meet our luggage, one of the many bug bears I had with the hotel was the amount of time I seemed to spend waiting for the lifts to arrive whether we were going up or down we seemed to spend a great deal of time waiting and trying to anticipate the lift that would arrive to prevent the inevitable scrum for the lift as by the time it had arrived there was a crowd of people waiting. The trip to the room is through dark and dimly lit corridors that have no natural light to them, with the grey decor and grey carpets its quite depressing. The room is incredibly compact and again very dark due to dark wood flooring & panelling, there is little to no natural light (despite haviing a window they have somehow managed to build a hotel that supresses natural light!) so felt like the evening all the time, the lighting whilst looking stylish is impractical (no central ceiling light!!), you cannot do anything in the main area of the bedroom (which when I talk about the bathrooom you'll understand why it is so annoying) due to it being so dark which in our room was compounded by the fact that the desk lamp didn't work. The bathroom is frankly ridiculous, it is so small that it is borderline impractical. You have a shower that has a shower curtain on each side which sticks to you as you shower, you step out onto the toilet area and have limited space to towel dry without running the risk of breaking your neck, If you are 5ft 11 then your knees touch the wall when you are sitting on the loo and with the sink on your right if your right handed then good luck when it comes to wiping, our toilet had a cracked bowl as all the storage shelves are above it (quick tip put down the the toilet lid - I nearly lost my deodrant when it fell off the shelf!!) & something has clearly fell off the shelve and into the toilet causing the damage. The sound proofing is poor and you can here next door clearly (suspect that is due to the fact the rooms are so small), ended up whispering for the most part, the doors slam shut and when a neighbour comes in you honestly think someone is trying to gain entry to your room. We ate in the hall of the hotel (tapas style where you help yourself), we arrived at 9pm with last orders at 10.25pm, of the 20 or so dishes that you should be able to self select there must have been 7 or 8 available, at no point did the 3 or 4 chefs who are behind an open counter cook even one of the dishes (all in all hugely disappointing), the courtyard was unavailable for 3 of the 5 days to to roof work being undertaken (shame as the weather was so good), the bar that the guide books rave about didn't even open during the 4 night duration of our stay (we were pushed towards the hall or the library), due to the bar being closed the library was full we ended up having to sit in reception with our cocktails - limited list and not very good to boot but expensive. The staff were pleasant throughout but the location isnt the best if you want nightlife and restaurants - would recommend Soho or Tribeca as apposed to Midtown West.

They lost one of the bags, finding it only after about 30 minutes. As in some other hotels, WiFi access was not free.

The bathroom sink was cracked, the bathroom floor tiles were cracked, the bathroom shower had a coating on it which was peeling off, the television set did not work (their engineering department finally came to fix it on the third of our four day stay), the bed springs made a terrible noise every time we moved (our apologies go out to our neighbors since the rooms do not have any sound proofing at all). What can you do? Given the challenges with our reservation, we should not have been shocked when a hotel employee knocked on our door at 6:00pm on our second day of our stay and asked us why we were still there. Our reservation was for three nights and four days. Thirty minutes later, another hotel employee showed up and did the exact same thing to us. Fifteen minutes after that our telephone rang and someone hung up after we answered it. We speculated it was a third hotel employee checking to see why we were still there. The next day both of our key cards stopped working and we had to go back to the reception desk to get them reprogrammed. The library was closed since they were re-painting the ceiling all weekend. Their beautiful outside decks were still not opened for the Spring season. The escalator going up to the lobby was broken for at least 24 hours. Theoretically they could have allowed us to manually walk up to the lobby, but they blocked it off and the line at the elevators was extremely long. We attempted to print our boarding passes in the business center prior to our departure but did not want to pay the $7.00 it would have cost us to do that. We paid $227 a night for the room including taxes which seemed reasonable enough. However, we expected more and would not go back.

However, I can understand that it is not what everyone would feel comfortable with. It is a trendy hotel with a focus on young professionals who are ready to have fun. With that said, we 50-somethings really enjoyed staying there and never felt like we didn't fit in. If you are looking for a traditional look and feel, then this is not the place for you. The rooms are tiny, but provided everything that we needed for our 3-day stay. This is not a room that will accommodate more that 2 people, and time in the bathroom can not be shared due to the limited space. Larger people may feel cramped in these rooms. I believe that they have larger rooms, but we didn't need anything more than we had for 2 people for 3 days. We had been advised to ask for a room on a higher floor, and on the 11th floor we had no problem with noise. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised that I never heard hallway noise, or even heard people in the rooms next to us. We splurged on a $17 martini and enjoyed the late night scene in the library bar. The atmosphere was great party scene and was very energizing for adults. For families traveling with kids, this hotel would not be where you, or your kids, would want to stay. It is definitely an adult atmosphere. Our room phone didn't work and the tv remote didn't have numbers, but this was obviously unique to our room. Our friends on the same floor had a phone that worked and their tv remote not only had numbers, it had a lot more channels than ours! The hotel is conveniently located close to Columbus Circle and the subway. The taxi drivers all seemed to know where The Hudson is located, so the lack of an outside sign wasn't a problem.

Speaking of the corridors, the one our room was on absolutely reeked of weed! The whole place feels very dated, like it was cutting edge 10 years ago and they have since done nothing to it at all, which I believe is the case.

There were people standing outside (smokers) as we rocked up in our cab on the first evening and as we went up the illuminated yellow escalotors into the lobby, house music pumped throughout. Very fun atmosphere and fabulous music!. The lobby is a glorified conservatory - there is ivy covering the ceiling and the reception desk runs along the back wall. The staff were very friendly (although had to wait about 40 mins for our luggage to be brought up to our room once we had checked in). Be warned! Everything is very dim-lit in this place! (a common theme in NY it seems). Our room was on the top floor. We had a deluxe room (basically 2 double beds and a bathroom), Do not expect to have much space, we paid top dollar to have this room as we had heard that the other rooms in this hotel (and everywhere else in NYC are teeny tiny). It was definately worth spending that bit extra. Lovely soft linen, comfortable beds, lots of mirrors but so so so dark. The bathroom was basic. It was jazzed up by the modern sink but the shower was aged and needed a re-vamp. But the water pressure was good and it was clean and thats what counts. We could hear quite alot of noise from the room next door at night. People who had obviously spent their evening in the bar downstairs and had come up to carry on their drinking. Not great but it was ok. We did wonder why everyhting (even in the corridors) was so dark and we concluded that it was a good mask for the peeling paintwork and pretty drab corridor decor. But the rest of the hotel and the City make up for the couple of bad points this palce has.

The location was the only positive that I could count in my review of the Hudson hotel. Situated by Columbus Circle near the entrance to Central Park, the hotel is in a really good place for hopping onto the subway or bus. The reception staff were very welcoming, Matthew on reception was really helpful. We had upgraded from a standard room after reading reports on here after we had booked the hotel. No real complaints about the size of the room although we're used to having drawers and a wardrobe to put our clothes etc in, and there was just a rail for hanging stuff on in our room. The lighting throughout the hotel is strange and very subdued, but having no real bright lighting in our hotel room was a bit off putting for my wife doing her makeup and hair. The bathroom created our main concern. We werent too bothered about the toilet roll holder hanging off the wall or the mould around the bath seal, but on the third day of our stay the toilet blocked up at 8am and started to overflow onto the bathroom floor. We immediately phoned reception who said they would send up an engineer straight away. We went out for breakfast, came back after an hour to pick up stuff and the toilet was still blocked, no one had been to it and the bathroom was in a state..and it stank. I went down to reception, told them again and they said that they \"were on it\" and an engineer would be right up. We went off into the city and returned at 4pm. Guess what..the toilet was still blocked and overflowing. The housekeeper had cleaned the bathroom and put bath towels around the toilet to soak up the spillage...gross. we phoned down to reception, they again said the engineer \"was on it\" and would be there straight away, half an hour later my wife went down to reception and complained, they said the engineer would be at our room before she was...half an hour later, and needing the toilet I went down to reception and really had to lose my temper with the staff who thought it was a big joke that I had to go down eleven floors to go to the toilet. I demanded that the duty manager came out, which he did and he promptly came to our room to look...only 9hours after it had been reported. The maintenance manager then dashed into our room with no word...cleared the toilet leaving half the contents on the bathroom floor and merely said..\"you need housekeeping now\". the duty manager was really apologetic and could give no reason why it had taken so long to fix the toilet...and offered us a free cocktail!!

The hotel was recommended to us by my partner\u2019s colleagues, due to its location, however , after booking the trip and reading the reviews on TripAdvisor I was apprehensive (to say the least!) about our choice of hotel. My main concerns were the bathroom with glass wall (I value my privacy), and the stories of loud music coming from the club throughout the night. Following an early morning and long flight, we arrived at the hotel almost spot on 3pm and went to check in- we were advised that check in was currently unavailable but to wait, and we would be called over 5-10 minutes later. 10 minutes later we noticed plenty of other people checking in without any problems, so my partner queued again and was successful in securing our room key. There were many others waiting around reception with their suitcases in the same predicament. The (standard) room was a very pleasant surprise- we were on the 10th floor, with no noise audible from the club (and relatively little from the street), the room had plenty of space for suitcases etc. and felt compact, rather than claustrophobic. The bathroom did have a clear glass wall, but when using the curtains outside and inside (there is a sheer curtain outside and two shower curtains on the inside) you couldn\u2019t see a thing. My partner did struggle slightly with the size of the bathroom (he is 6ft 4in), but not enough to make it an issue. The bed was comfy, and the room was warm. There are a number of great restaurants within walking distance from the hotel- our favourites were Eatery, El Centro and Sushi Damo- along with a great Whole Foods Store at Columbus Circle. Most of the time we walked around Manhattan (a slow walk from the hotel down to the financial district took a couple of hours), but the subway is easily accessible at Columbus Circle. We didn\u2019t utilise any of the hotel amenities (e.g. gym, bar, cafeteria etc.) so can\u2019t comment on those. The hotel doesn't offer free Wi-Fi so my suggestion would be to visit the Starbucks very close by (<2 min walk) and use theirs. The only negative comment I do have is in relation to the staff at the reception desk, and I agree with other reviews that they can be very rude- in addition to our problems checking in, an example is one morning my partner wanted directions to a well known toy store, which happens to be round the corner from the hotel- we went up to a well staffed, empty desk and after eventually being acknowledged by the guy behind the counter were told (rather rudely) that we would have to go and ask the concierge. It would have taken him seconds to answer our question and we would have been left with a much better impression.

We are residents of New York City and thought it would be fun to get away at a nice hotel in the city. We chose the Hudson hotel near the Columbus Circle area. Everything about our stay was perfect, it made our first Valentine's together that more memorable. We checked in on a Saturday afternoon at 3pm. We were helped by Hudson Regional Guest Experience Manager, Ms. Shacazia Brown. She was very pleasant, knowledgeable and all smiles upon our arrival. She made us feel very welcomed and seemed thankful about having our business. We were checked into our room within 5 minutes. She gave us a brief tour of the hotel's Library Bar, Hudson Bar and Restaurant area. She knew in advance that is was a special romantic weekend and presented us with chocolates and a bottle of champagne in our deluxe studio room. The decor was amazing- dark, hardwood floors with white and silver steel furniture. I must have said at least three times during our stay, \"I want to LIVE here\". Instead of visiting the MOMA, we ended up taking a nap for two hours after feeling how comfortable our queen size bed felt. After we returned from dinner, we had reservations at the Library Bar near a fireplace. It was such a romantic setting for celebrating our love. We relaxed for an hour and went back to our room to freshen up. We had 11pm reservations at the Hudson bar and were seated immediately. The DJ played great tunes all night as we sipped champagne, ate strawberries and danced. The party was filled with people of all different ages and cultures. It was nice to be in a different atmosphere for a change. We ended the night sleeping like babies in our comfortable bed. The next morning we had breakfast at Hudson's beautiful rustic style restaurant. The breakfast selection was divine and my palate was extremely satisfied. Upon check out the next morning, we were greeted and checked out in 60 seconds.

It\u2019s become my \u201chome away from home\u201d in NYC. I\u2019ve read some other reviews that have comments about small rooms and the hotel getting a little worn around the edges (although, on the whole, the vast majority of reviews are quite positive.) Well, honestly, in terms of room-size, for a standard, basic rate, I haven\u2019t found any fine boutique hotel that can match the Hudson on that front. Sure you can get a \u201cbigger\u201d room at a more \u201caffordable\u201d hotel, but you would miss out on the Hudson\u2019s fine location, well-designed, sophisticated, and stylized rooms and common spaces (their bars, lounges, etcetera,) and the fine service they deliver.

However, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised and the hotel surpassed my expectations. The exterior is very modern and unusual, as is the lobby decor, which was quite striking. Definitely made a positive change from the standard hotel experience. It was really warm in the Reception area which was lovely after coming in from the freezing NY weather! The staff were polite and attentive. Our room was on the 10th floor which was far enough away from the Bar area to not be affected by any noise. In fact we weren't disturbed by any kind of noise throughout the whole stay, the walls must be well insulated as we were never aware of any other guests at all! The room was well appointed with a lovely flatscreen TV with lots of channels. There was a huge mirror (which helped make the small space look bigger), and the best was really comfy and spacious (we had a Queen room). The window was quite drafty and was directly above the pillow area, so this was a bit unpleasant at times. However, there is an easy to use control system for heating and a/c which helped. There was also an electronic safe, very handy. The main problem with the room was the size of the bathroom, as has been reported on here- it was tiny! At first it was a bit of a shock, but it was fine to deal with, everything was clean and modern, and the shower was nice and powerful with good temperatures. We actually didn't end up finding the bathroom size an issue, as had thought we might. The see-through wall was a bit odd, and could have done without that!! Everything was clean and the domestic staff were efficient and unobtrusive. The lack of cupboard/wardrobe space was slightly annoying but I would say we definitely had enough floor space to not feel cramped. The location of the hotel was great, in one of the nicer neighbourhoods, we were virtually next door to the south west corner of Central Park, easily accessible to the great shopping areas in this vicinity, and a short walk from Times Square. We walked this route many times and in fact we only used taxis coming home at night, and when we went slightly further afield to the Financial district. Taxis were cheap and easy to come by.

The suite was spacious and well appointed for work - complete with a printer and extra-long USB cable to plug into my laptop while still siting at the generously sized desk. Nice touch. The suite did lack any decent lighting - which sets a nice mood - but not if you're looking frantically for a dropped cufflink while late for a meeting! The single room is useless for the biz traveller and should be avoided at all costs. Many reviews here will detail this problem - but the singles are simply unfit for a couple or even a single biz traveller. But worst is the pounding disco. If you need a god night's sleep before a key meeting - even being on the TWELFTH floor wasn't distance enough to shield my ears from the thumping of the main floor bars. I totally get that this is an ultra-hip boutique hotel for the trendy, in-crowd. But I had NO way of knowing this when reserving in Hotwire - so I was stuck staying at a hotel that was in NO way biz friendly unless you spring for a $$$$ suite.

Location: Right by 59th Street/Columbus Circle subway so it is easy to get anywhere from there once underground. There is a lot around the area and we ended up walking into Times Square a few times (maybe 15-20 minutes (?). There are plenty of places to eat in the area - classic diners, and deli's (Carnegies is an obvious choice!!). All night supermarket and pharmacy (CVS) nearby. In summary I found the location and proximity to the main central attractions an subway a draw card to stay at the Hudson. Cost: It cost me $1240 for the 5 nights - I did my research and that was BY FAR the cheapest I could find in the area, I was therefore sceptical but well worth it. I booked through their website directly and went for one of their special deals. The room type I got was the Kind Deluxe - see my description below about why I recommend going for the more expensive option. >>This did not include breakfast. Room: Ok, it was small lets not kid but let that not deter you. As a result of all the reviews I read on this site I went for the Deluxe King - which basically means there is about 1 meter space on each side of the king size bed. Trust me - it makes a difference! I saw the regular rooms and while the deluxe king is small the regular (queen) rooms are tiny. So in terms of size the King Deluxe was more than adequate to store suitcases comfortably. Living your hotel room in NY is against moral law. The room was very clean and modern, It had a flat screen TV (21'') with plenty of channels. (incl HD) Bed was comfortable. We were on the 7th floor. No real view. Mini electronic safe. Internet access is $10 per day. Bathroom: This was the only real downer - it was tiny: shower/toilet/sink in maybe 2 square meters. Shower was great. If you are tall you might battle to sit on the toilet. Another thing I wasnt mad about was that there is full length glass window in the shower with direct visibility to the bedroom - while is it covered from the inside with a shower curtain (plus one more shower curtain on the other side of the shower) if you don't like watching your partner take a dump then you might not like this feature. That was the only real think I didnt like. Hotel Facilities: >Couple of bars - one with a pool table and tables fr boardgames like backgammon or chess - quite chilled. It is quite a popular bar so it can be noisy and busy but its a quality place. >Restaurant - I think that is where they serve breakfast - but we didnt go there. In summer they have a a bar on the 15th floor in the hotel - was not open in December. >Luggage - we left luggage on the last day at the hotel - very good service and secure. > Concierge - dedicated desk to answer all your questions.

Also not a single hook for a coat/belts/necklaces etc. There was a table/desk in the room but no plug near it so I had to charge my computer on the floor and then work using the battery which was very inconvenient.

There's no doubt it's an impressive place on arrival, a neon lit escalator ascends you toward the hotel lobby where check in was smooth and the reception staff were helpful. Up to our room and having read some previous reviews, I anticipated it would be a bit compact - it was! Any more than a couple of nights and I think it would have been too much. Whatsmore the room was roasting hot - in December (!?) - so we had to run a rather noisy AC unit for a lot of the time Later in the evening we made it down to the library bar for our first drink in NYC. I paid the bar tender $9 for a bottle of Heniken - plus tip! I'd expected NYC might be expensive but wow! My other observation would be the lighting. Dark and moody is great but sometimes I enjoy the luxury of actually seeing what I'm doing and in the Hudson that's nigh on impossible.

We were there celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary. We checked in around 8:00pm on Tuesday night and were warmly greeted by the reception staff. I requested an upgrade but was told there were no room upgrades available but that there was a room available with a queen bed. We were pleasantly surprised and agreed. The room wasn\u2019t quite as big as a closet, but would have been adequate had the heating system not been so LOUD. It was 22 degrees in NYC and the heat came on often. So often, that it was difficult to get a good night\u2019s sleep. It would come on and then ping ping ping ping ping for twenty minutes or so. We also had issues with the television and that is why we called the front desk first off. Front desk advised us that they would send a technician up so we waited and waited for the technician to show up. We tired of this and decided to go out. Returned a couple of hours later expecting our issues to be resolved, but no such luck! Call one to the management at that time got me a voice mailbox (Michael). Call two, 45 minutes to an hour later, got me another voice mail box (Christopher). I left messages each time for a return call. Finally, about two hours later a very knowledgable tech came to our room checked the heat and basically told us there was nothing he could do, even with the tv. He did what he could, acted like he cared and asked us to let the Guest rep know of our experience the following morning. The following morning, I had not received a return call from either of the voice mail messages left for management the night before, so my husband and I contacted the concierge, who introduced us to Shacazia Brown, the Regional Guest Experience Manager. We explained our experience to her, she was sympathetic, apologetic and assured us that she would make it right. WOW! Did she ever! My husband and I returned later that day to an unbelievable room. Shacazia had our luggage brought up to the new room. It was AMAZING and surpassed any accommodation that I could have imagined in NYC!

I stayed on the 11th floor and it was fine. I feel sorry for the front desk staff at the Hudson, as they do a great job of providing a friendly service but are constantly having to bear the brunt of disgruntled guests' complaints because the infrastructure of the building is not up to scratch. Saying that I don't think I'd stay here again, probably because I'd be here for business and this hotel doesn't really cater for that category of traveller. Plus, if you happened to get on a bad floor and had some of the issues that other travelers have had (which I did not), then I could see how you would feel you wouldn't be getting value for money at all.

Rooms: As others have said, the rooms are SMALL!!! That's absolutely true, but we weren't going to NYC to spend time in the room. However, I THOUGHT that getting the next level double would have given us some more space which it did not. The room was definately small, you had to side step along the bottom of the bed to get to the desk and bathroom, but they made up for the limited space with unique design and eclectic touches. We never unpacked because of our short stay, so the lack of storage wasn't an issue for us. Our room had space to hang items and a few small cube shelves. The bathroom was small and outdated (shower), but it was clean and served us well. The bed was FABULOUS and we slept well after a long day out walking. Staff: The staff at The Hudson are fantastic. They make it a point to ask you about yourself and offer any assistance they can. Everyone we spoke to, from check in to the porters out front (even in the frigid weather!) were very accomodating and friendly. Location: We walked EVERYWHERE during our visit, which was a major plus. If you're fit and like to walk, you can get all over the city. The hotel is easily accessible from Central Park, Rockefellar Plaza, shopping along 5th Ave, Times Square, etc. We didn't use any of the restaurants or clubs in the hotel, so I can't comment on those. If you're driving into the city, take advantage of the parking/room package and ask for late checkout. It was great not to worry about parking during our trip, just dropped off and picked up curbside.

The closeness of the hotel to the famed sites of New York was a real plus. One morning we went jogging in Central Park which was right around the corner (but cold!). Also she wanted to go shopping of course and her beloved Bergdorf was close. We were pointed to some great restaurants around the hotel by the concierges (Bouchon and Marea - sp??) which was such a nice treat being walking distance. After dinner every night we would walk back to the hotel and hit the bars. Our fav was the one near the front desk area. It had a glass floor that was lit up and an awesome DJ. Fun, fun, fun.

I am very happy to say that I have walked away a happy customer. Firstly, the hotel was very easy to find with the shuttle company having no problems at all with location. As we entered the street it stood out straight away and looked exactly like the photos I had seen in my research. We were greeted by very friendly staff who took care of our bags. The foyer is amazing and on first impressions we were impressed with the wow factor! On checking-in, we voiced our concerns of e-mail and phone service we had received prior to our arrival, to Sunny on reception who immediately apologised and offered us complimentary cocktails. He was very friendly and professional. On checking into our room we were more than pleased with the space, light and quality features of the room. We had three staying in a double deluxe room and there was more than enough room for all our luggage as well as the shopping we accumulated during our 10 day stay. The room was bright, we could easily walk around our beds and the bathroom was more than big enough. Tv was mounted in a hide away space which could be pulled out or put away. We had a solid door leading inot the bathroom which was great as was little worried about some reviews that reported a glass door, indicating no privacy. We were also very happy with the location and the surrounding shops. There was no problem finding a supermarket or somewhere close by for breakfast. We were located on the 11th floor and could not hear the night club that runs most nights. The only small gripes we had were we booked a room with a park view but we were given street view which was slightly noisy but we soon adjusted. Towards the end of stay house keeping didn't provide us with towels and on three occasions we had to call to request them. Not sure why this occured. Pillows are way too soft but that's only a minor complaint. I am sure I could have resolved this if I asked. We were dissapointed that the roof top terrace and Hudson private garden weren't open as this was not advertised on there website when we booked but really, we spent so much time site seeing that we didn't really get a chance to make the most of hotel facilities. Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would look at booking this again when I return.

Our bathroom was a good size and the towels and toiletries are top notch. The sheets and bedding were great and I loved the pillows (seriously thought about taking one, but resisted).

Went back down to the front desk to tell them I wanted a new room and they assured me the luggage would be out of the room by the time I got back up there . They claimed someone had checked out and the bellman hadn't claimed the luggage yet. I demanded a new room as I was creeped out and they assured me there were no rooms left. But yet there were 20 ppl in line waiting to check in so wonder what rooms they got? The room was a joke. The toilet was about 6 inches from the wall -- as someone who is 6ft tall I barely fit. And the bathroom so small I had to stand outside of it to blowdry my hair. The room has this strange dark wood paneling on it and the windows are poorly sealed. I could hear street noise all night long and I was on a higher floor. I am used to noise as I live in downtown Chicago, but this was unnecessarily loud. And no full length mirror.

The good: The Hudson NYC is a great intersection between hip and reasonably priced. You won't find a truly hip hotel that is more reasonable in NYC. The bad; What do you sacrifice? People complain of the small rooms here, but I actually think that's fine: I like a hotel that pushes people out of their rooms and into communal areas The real problem here is the service, which is just utterly horrible. They must focus all their energy on check-in staff, because after you check in, service is pretty much non-existant. And I don't mean \"hip hotel\" bad service, I mean Denny's at 3am bad service. I've stayed here several times, and this is the only consistent. Two examples: I was trying to sleep in and forgot to put the do not disturb sign outside my room- do not make this mistake. Not only did they open my door three times in one hour, each time me yelling come back later, the last time the maid had a yealling conversation with me asking if I was going to leave and when I was going to do so. Then it was social hour outside my room for the maids: they conversed loudly as I failed to sleep off my jet lag. I can deal with bad service as long as it doesn't get in the way of sleeping. Never has a front desk hung up on me more than here. General rule of thumb: you need to call about five times to get someone and then you literally need to call again and again for the most basic stuff. Nothing more annoying then a hotel guest who asks random staff to perform duties outside their role, similarly pretty annoying when hotel staff tell you they don't do what you're asking with no suggested solution. Maybe this explains the forgotten wake up calls, but having to wait 90 mins for a toothbrush to be delivered to my room and calling over and over for it- that will ruin your morning. The service here is actually bad enough to mess your stay up, trust me. Lastly, if you do stay here, shoot for spring or summer so you can take advantage of the roof terrace and private garden.

We set the parameters for a 3 \u00bd star hotel in midtown. Priceline booked us into the Hudson on West 58th. The website for the hotel had great pictures and seemed like a very nice chic hotel. I checked tripadvisor for reviews and was a little concerned with what I read. In an effort to make our stay as seamless as possible, I sent an email to the hotel. I just wanted to make sure we would get a non smoking room with a queen bed, I didn\u2019t think that was too much to ask. When I did not hear back within 2 days, I emailed the hotel again; still no response. I then decided to call the hotel and spoke to a lovely young lady (Diana) at the reception who was extremely helpful. She even suggested that I contact the concierge desk to get some suggestions on what to do and where to eat. She graciously transferred my call. There was no answer at the Concierge desk, so I left a detailed message with 2 phone numbers where I could be reached. Once again, no one contacted me. After 2 days, I was starting to feel nervous, so I called the hotel and left a message with Assistant Front Office Manager expressing my concern with the lack of response I had received. He called me back and left me a message letting me know that the hotel had upgraded us and had asked the concierge to contact me. We arrived at the hotel and we very impressed with the lobby and then the Front Office staff. A young man by the name of Chris checked us in and was fantastic! I can\u2019t say enough about the staff and their desire to exceed their guests\u2019 expectations. I feel bad for them as they are continuously having to apologize for the hotels shortcomings. We eventually made it to our room. Now if you are looking for a large room, this is probably not the best place to book. The rooms are small, but if you have travelled through Europe, this won\u2019t bother you. I am sad to say that it all went downhill from there. My husband took a shower the next morning and a bunch of flies flew out of the showerhead (yuk!!). Additionally, some of the tiles were cracked and not very clean. Once we killed all the flies, I took my shower and then proceeded to drying my hair. After about 2 minutes of having the hairdryer going, the power went out. We then called the front desk (they were very apologetic) and they sent the engineer to turn the power back on. I then resumed drying my hair and the power went our again!!! We called the front desk again and they said they would send the engineer once more. At this point I decided that I would be spending my morning trying to get my hair dry, so we headed out (wet hair and all) to start seeing the sights. On our way out, we mentioned our issue to the Manager (Jackie) in the lobby. She was very sweet an assured us that this would be looked into. I should mention that this was at 10 am. We returned to our room later that evening, around 8pm, to find that the power had never been turned back on. Although the bed had been made, the fact that there was no power would lead me to believe that the maid did not vacuum or clean the bathroom. The room was blistering hot as the air conditioning had not been functioning all day (no power). We called the reception, yet again, and explained our problem. The hotel employee was very apologetic (again) and assured us that the engineer was on his way up. After waiting 15 minutes in a warm dark room, someone walked by our room and poked their head in and went to the power panel to turn the power back on. I then went into the hallway to ask him why this kept happening. He informed me that maybe I shouldn\u2019t use my hairdryer. There is more to our stay at this hotel, but I think I\u2019ve mentioned enough to give you all a taste of what to expect. From the exterior this seems like a very trendy spot, but it ends there.

Now this could go one of two ways depending on your frame of mind... We came off a late flight from London and hit the lobby right at the peak of it's 'nightclub' vibe. This is all well and good if you are there to party but I could not physically hear the reception staff and spent the entire conversation miming to them. Despite this, reception were friendly and helpful. The rooms are pretty shocking. Having stayed at many other Schrager hotels (Mondrian/ Shore Club etc) I knew it would be pretty impractical but this was ridiculous. Here are my gripes: -hanging space is 0.5 metres wide with 5 hangers -no drawers to put clothes away (you end up stacking clothes everywhere which slightly defeats the point of having a 'design' style room) -no slippers -no dressing gown -room so small I couldn't get around the TV to get into bed (I am not obese! and we were staying in a suite) -no overhead lighting - thank God it was Halloween to help explain my mismatching clothes and make up. -bathrooms remind you or an out of date nursing home -bath so small you couldn't drown a hamster in it -no fridge although they are snack areas on each floor which sounds great until you realise they are just big vending machines which isn't stylish or welcoming - staff were rude in the bar and I thought one sullen girl was actually going to start a fight with me when I asked for another drink. Charmless and bolchy. The whole lobby scene is just a bit naff and the furniture/ whole Schrager look is so over done it really feels about 10 years too late. Hotel definitely needs a refurb. If I see one more ghost chair in a hotel lobby... On the plus side: - breakast was lovely. Efficient and friendly service - fabulous location just behind Colombus Circus, near the park and near to good shops - room service was yummy (although each item comes with a $5 charge but 18% service on top!!!) As a finale, some 'hilarious' joker decided to set off the fire alarm in the hotel bar somewhere so we spent the hours of 1-3am listening to announcements in the hallways telling us to evacuate/ not evacuate which was slightly disconcerting to say the least.

What I mean by that is that the atmosphere and cool decorating is obviously more important to the owners than meeting basic expectations most of us have of a hotel- clean facilites and value for your money.

We had a studio / queen; and while this may be one of the bigger rooms in the hotel it was still smaller than pretty much any other standard hotel room I've stayed in across this country. Also, the shower curtain was stained and since the tub is so narrow, it wants to envelope you as you take a shower. Nasty. The rug looked barely vacuumed. The deadbolt on the door usually didn't work. The icemaker on our floor and the floor above us didn't work. The icemaker on the floor below did work but many of the ice cubes had specks of dirt in them. The ice tubs were all dirty. The room was dusty. A basic breakfast was $29. A bottle of beer was $9. One of our rooms wasn't ready for check in until after 4:30. I could go on and on. When you pay over $500 a night, you should expect basic things such as the aformentioned to not be an issue. But at the Hudson, they are. We were part of a large group with several rooms, and I saw the same issues in the other rooms as well. Honestly, I find it insulting to pay so much and yet still have the issues we had. I know the Hudson staff reads the reviews here from time to time since they do occasionally respond. My question is, how many times do people have to complain about the same things before you will actually do something about it? Talk is cheap. Yes, the location was great and the staff was friendly.

Luckily our taxi driver knew the hote and assured us that he was dropping us off at the right place. Check in was efficient and the reception staff were friendly. Our room was on the 17th floor. Very small, more like a ships cabin, but it was clean and quite cosy. I liked the wood panelling, and there was a good view from the window towards the Hudson river. Slept well. We were given free WLAN for the first night, after that it was 10 dollars for 24 hours. Although we had not ordered breakfast we were allowed to help ourselves to large paper cups of coffee which we drank on the terrace outside the reception area which was nice. The staff seemed quite professional and were willing to chat when the< were not busy. The location was good, not far from Central Park and we were able to walk to Times Square in about 15 minutes and take in some street life on the way (quite safe, we walked back at 1.30am and we did not get mugged). There is a disco every night but we\u00b4re getting a bit old for that. Looks like it is popular with non-residents also. As far as the design goes, the reception area is too dark and the constant music gets annoying afer a while. Overall we liked our three night stay, although the small size of the standard rooms would put some people off. The hotel had a lot of New York character.

I did my research on the hotel and the photos look very impressive! But when one actually sees it for real and not virtual, it was disappointing. The reception is busy, the lobby is a bustle, getting checked in requires a credit card security and I was given a magnetic key card for my room. However, when I got to the room, the door didn't open. So I had to go down to the lobby again with all my baggage, received another magnetic key and another room on the 15th floor - on the same floor as the Sky Terrace. The room is small, very small. My bedroom has more space. It had dark wooden panelled walls, small bathroom and sitting on the small toilet my knees almost touched the wall. The bed was comfortable and I slept well in it. However, the air conditioner at the head of the bed is quite loud, but adjustable. No coffee making facilities, I'm glad I bought my own little coffee maker. In the evening, the lobby is LOUD! Whooa... The Hudson Bar / Club is a place for young people to meet including a DJ and loud House music. I did not attend. Apparently, there is now a new Club in the basement with a far better sound system. The one in the Lobby is quite shrill. The location of the Hudson is excellent, a close walk to Columbus Circle & Central Park. The subway at 59th & Columbus is also very good to get anywhere in Manhattan. There are quite few shops, including a good pharmacy and supermarket across the street on W58th & 9th.

There is so much to tell. First let me give some examples of the challenges I've experienced with the rooms. Okay. First of all, I was warned that most of the hotel rooms in NY manhattan are really small. The rooms in the Hudson hotel are so small, that you cannot: - watch television from your bed without twisting your neck - sit on the toilet (there isn't enough room for sitting normally) - take your baggage out from your suitcase. There just isn't 9 square feet of open space. Don't believe me, just check their site or check some photo's You can: - sleep on the bed (good quality bed) - take a shower To summarize the size and quality of the room: Some bathrooms of other hotels are bigger then these rooms. Service: As you are paying $200 dollars a night you would expect some service. Some examples of what we experienced: - no doormen, a doormen, five doormen, no doormen. On some days there are five doormen at the entrance opening the doors and arranging cabs for you. On most of the days we didn't see any doormen - on three of the five days we stayed in the hotel (we payed in advance, stupid us) we could not enter the rooms. Both cards (we booked 2 rooms) where blocked. We got the explanation from the staff that that was because of some magnetic fields some stores produced at the exits. However on one occasion we just drank a coffee at the hotel bar and the card was blocked again. - We waited multiple times for more then five minutes on the elevators. On most of the occasions the elevators that did stop at the lobby where full...... - We waited for 25 minutes for 1 coffee and 1 cappuccino. When we said it was taking to long and we where leaving we where abruptly halted by the staff that we could not leave without paying for something we did not get. After we paid the bill we expected the coffee to be served. It did not... for another 10 minutes. Come on... 35 minutes for 1 coffee and 1 cappuccino at 11 in the morning - My dad (55 years old) who has problems with his knee was almost thrown on the ground by staff at the entrance of the restaurant. The waiter grabbed him at the elbow and pulled him abruptly backwards. The explanation: \"He should have waited for another 2 seconds before he could enter the restaurant\".... (really.. his colleague was waving at us to enter). I had to control myself not to throw the a#$%ole on the floor. Of course we did not enter the restaurant for breakfast and the staff wanted an explanation why we did not want to have breakfast. Do I need to spell it out???? Sleep quality: - Okay, I need to say that the beds are lovely. I did sleep quite well - The sound isolation is unbelievably bad. We where staying at the 7th floor and we could here loud conversations on the street level. Thank god I had some earplugs. - Bed linen is changed every day. Wonderful To summarize everything: if the quality and service is bad, but the price is good, okay, that can happen. But if all these three aspect are really bad you have a bad hotel. I will not stay in this hotel (and probably the whole chain) ever again. I will not recommend it to my family and friends. I will discourage them to stay here.

Unfortunately, this is where the style ends. The room was tiny, even by Manhattan standards. The bed barely fit, the TV was attached in such a weird position on the wall which made it useless if laying down, maintenance was poor with a dangerous damaged power socket and badly finished plaster. The bathroom was so small that when the room was occupied by two you had to climb over one another and of dubious cleanliness. The air conditioning unit was placed unconventionally on the exterior wall which pumped cold area vertically resulting a sub zero area at one end of the room only. Worse still, the vent had the effect of letting all noise from outside into the room, and even on the 19th floor, every sound from a busy Manhattan street and adjacent air conditioning units prevented a single night's uninterrupted sleep. We complained about this on the first night, only to be abruptly informed that no other rooms were vacant - more or less \"tough luck\". Could things get any worse? Oh yes. On our third night, the smoke alarm started to emit an intermittent beeping in the middle of the night. This soon stopped so we assumed all was well, until 1.30am the following night when the same occurred, more persistently, prompting a call to reception which led to a room visit by maintenance staff. Their specialist attempts at resolving our problem consisted of removing the whole alarm from the wall, informing us it would be repaired the next day! Thank god the hotel didn't burst into flames that night leaving us oblivious to our fiery demise. At least we would have gone to our graves surrounded by an ipod dock and CD player. The hotel bars were impressively designed. A shame then about the dismal drinks menu, arrogant staff, and ludicrous prices for watered down \"cocktails\". The choice of 3 bottled beers came in at $9 a piece, with cocktails at $16 each. Crazy. Avoid this place at all costs. If you've got buckets of money and want to be seen in a pretentious bar, then visit here for a few drinks only.

You cant get much cheaper then this bearing in mind that there was no refund in case of problems but that was my risk to take. The experience overall got to me i must say. Very original, loungy atmosphere at the reception area.Many people seem to hate the fact that its quite dark in most hotel areas but i wasnt bothered at all. Original as i already mentioned.

This was the most strangest hotel I have ever been in (even in Europe). NYC is filled with trendy niche hotels but this one is just plain bizarre to the extreme! I stayed here one night because I had to move hotels and NYC was filled everywhere and PriceLine put me here - ugh. The Cons: Take a building make it as dark as you can from the lobby to the halls to the rooms. Add the strangest furniture combinations (not even contemporary). The rooms are smaller than a walk in closest. NO ... I AM REALLY SERIOUS! Read all of my travel reviews... I am not some untraveled one timer that complains on tripadvisor - these are THE smallest rooms in America - I would be willing to bet that statement! It is insane. It is beyond NYC small rooms - it is smaller than a dorm room! I cannot even express how SMALL and cramped you are. The bed is so low to the ground and on plywood - futons are more comfy. There are two metal end \"tables\" - the lights are strange backlite colored creepy lights on the side of the bed. That is IT - nothing else can fit. If you have any luggage you have one little \"indent\" in the wall upon entry to store a duffle bag. The windows and AC are behind the bed - but the bed is so low and hard you cannot see out the window anyway. It is so dark! The paneling on the walls and the wood floors in the room are dark walnut color as well. NOW, you think that is crazy... the bathroom is not enclosed for privacy. The shower (no tub) has a glass wall looking at the bed on one side and if you sit on the toilet you will hit your knees on the wall in front of you. You could shave, use the comode and shower all at once. There is literally NO PRIVACY - it is part of the small room. It is insane! Mostly Europeans staying here or college kids - which is fine - but not because it is cheaper - just because they don't care. I have never seen a hotel so far fetched and creepy. There is no insulation between rooms or hall - and since hard wood floors - you hear everything next door, in hall and above you like there is a speaker in your room.

My family has also stayed at that hotel and I've stayed at Royalton with my husband. In other words, I was a repeat customer of this chain. When making reservations, I made my past experiences known including the exact rooms in which I had stayed. I also had all of my previous correspondence with the chain available so I knew the prior rates I had paid. I was quoted a price on a 'Superior Queen' that was higher than I had paid in the past and was told it was the best that could be done. Shame on me for not doing my research and assuming that my past patronage would be valued; it was not. I walked into my room and felt like I was 10 or 12 and camping. The walls were covered in a dark wood and the minuscule room was dominated by a very low, uncomfortable bed. There was one tiny chair and desk, two miniature nightstands and no mini-bar or dresser. This is not a room that would lend itself to ever having room service. The bathroom was also substandard with a tiny shower and no place to really spread out toiletries. This meant that every time one of us would need to shower we had to bring our supplies from the floor elsewhere in the room. And if you would find yourself needing to sit on the toilet (image?) you would find your knees against the wall you are facing - and I'm 5'2\". Immediately it was clear that we didn't have enough towels, enough luggage racks (two were needed), a regular ironing board (rather than the laughable table version provided to use on the little desk I suppose) and we were without any robes for two unrelated women. I had to call for these items that I had always assumed would be provided as a minimum standard of comfort. The next morning I realized that the hotel had no shower gel or cotton swabs and by that time I was livid because of bad sleep. At least they had bar soap and a blow dryer The hotel looks chic and has a nice selection of bars. I suppose if one were looking to hook up with someone this would be a nice enough venue. But if you were staying for days and traveling with a colleague you would find this hotel woefully lacking in comfort primarily due to the space constraints. I'm sure if I had paid more I would have had a bigger room. But I was not expecting to pay more within the chain in the same city and to get so much less.

I booked it on Tablet Hotels, and it cost $189 on Friday and $209 on Saturday. This is EXCELLENT value for a clean and comfortable hotel with a bit more pizazz than your average chain hotel in New York City. However, I wasn't totally thrilled and likely won't go back unless I need a really cheap hotel quickly. Pros: The hotel is a good location for tourists, especially if you haven't explored NYC much. It's at 58th and 8th, close to many tourist attractions (Times Square, Grand Central Station, Broadway, Central Park, Bloomingdale's). More experienced NYC travelers will appreciate its proximity to Central Park on a nice day, as well as nearby Plaza Hotel, Campbell Apartment, and Per Se. It's a Morgans hotel, so the design is cool and trendy. The room was very clean and it quiet enough to get a good rest. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful in getting taxis. Of course, the price cannot be beat. Cons: The room was just too small. My boyfriend and I felt borderline claustrophobic after an hour (and we had to keep our blind shut due to the view of pipes and dirt). Although I have absolutely no complaints with cleanliness or service, it was hard to move around the room, there was virtually no storage space, and I could barely fit in the bathroom (and I'm a very petite woman). If you've been to NYC many times you likely won't be thrilled with the location. It was a $10-15 taxi ride to our favorite bars and restaurants downtown (and there was a subway issue so we mostly took cabs). It was difficult to find a bagel or deli sandwich nearby and we ended up wandering for a while at lunchtime. Also, we were eager to try the Hudson's famous bar/club on Saturday night. We left the East Village after dinner at Momofuku because we had heard great things about the Hudson's bars. However, we were disappointed that the rooftop closed at 11pm, and the main bar was a little too club-like for our tastes. I think it's had it's day... But, if you're a college student or early 20-something looking for the whole NYC experience, the Hudson is great value. You'll get a clean, stylish room in a good location, with a few bars and a dance club to boot.", "Date": "August 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "White Plains, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cPoor attempt at Poshness\u201d", "Author": "Crandolph2001", "ReviewID": "UR77128346", "Content": "We stayed at Hudson Hotel for almost an entire week.

The size of the rooms is crazy, a standard queen barely has enough space for one person to walk around let alone two. We upgraded for an extra 20.00 a night to a superior queen which adds about 4-6 feet to one side of the room. We had enough space for us and 3 suitcases and nothing else. The building looks as though it was built in the early 1900's and someone tried to renovate it into a hotel as cheaply as possible but still TRY to make it look trendy. The result was a very dark and very cramped building which at every turn puts form before function. The room smelled musty as there is no ventilation fan for the bathroom, there is some sort of vent but it is on the wall and there is no fan so I assume there is plenty of mold growing in there. There was a black jumping bug infestation growing in our shower which the maid ignored and this tells me our shower was never even cleaned during our 1 week stay. Room service and the bar are a complete joke, everything is so overpriced it is unaffordable for any normal traveler. A mixed drink is 16.00 plus tax and tip at the bar. Room service was so costly I took one look at the menu, laughed and put the menu away for the rest of my stay.

Disappointing on every level!\u201d", "Author": "JBBChicago", "ReviewID": "UR74821880", "Content": "I stayed at the Hudson with my husband in late July for the wedding of a friend. We stayed in a block of approximately 70 rooms and every single person who stayed at the hotel had serious issues. Let's start with my experience: We entered the hotel through the finger print smudged front doors and rode up the depressing escalator to a sort of, almost cool lobby. Then we were directed through the crowd of wanna-be trendoids to the front desk. Be aware there is no security at this hotel so anyone in the lobby or at the bar can roam throughout the guest floors at any time. Our check in was reasonably smooth. After walking down a dark, hot hallway with peeling paint that smelled distinctly of urine, we reached our room (Rm 416). It was tiny even by New York standards - even by European standards! - but that was the least of the problems. The bed was essentially a wooden board with uncovered, unpadded springs which made sleeping impossible. The air conditioner is located directly behind the headboard so a stream of freezing cold air pours over the headboard uncomfortably on to your face but doesn't actually cool off the rest of the room. Noise from the pathetic, pseudo-trendy bar is inescapable, and the bathroom, in addition to being so tiny your knees hit the wall if you use the toilet, was filthy. The shower grout and drain were coated with mold and the drain backed up as soon as the water was turned on. Needless to say, at 6:00am the next morning my husband went to the front desk to complain. Luckily the gentleman at the desk was helpful and apologetic (incidentally, he was not at all surprised by the complaints) and upgraded us to a \"deluxe\" room for the remainder of our stay. He told us to leave our bags packed in the room and they would be transferred to our new room by the 3:00pm re-check in time. When I re-checked in at 3:30pm, I asked the front desk if our luggage had already been delivered as I had a wedding related party to get to at 4:15pm and I was assured we were set. Upon arriving at the \"deluxe\" room (slightly larger, slightly less mold - still subpar) I discovered the bags were not there. I called the front desk and politely explained the situation, and I was assured I would get a call back with the location of my bags and an ETA. Fifteen minutes go by with no call and no bags so I call back - no bags. Ten minutes later I call back - no bags. Finally at 4:35 (20 minutes after I was supposed to leave!) I call to say I will come get my bags myself if they tell me where they are and ask to speak to a manager. I am then told that not only can I not to pick up my bags, but there are no managers anywhere in the hotel who are available to help me, but if I leave me room number a manager will call me back in the evening. Ten minutes later (a full hour and forty five minutes after check in time) the bags finally arrive. A manager never contacted me or my husband. The other members of our party staying at the Hudson experienced the following: - multiple power outages in multiple rooms during the stay - air conditioners which broke down and were never fixed despite calls to the front desk - broken lights in the bathroom - no mirror in one of the rooms except for a pocket sized shaving mirror attached to the wall - as a group of us walked down the disgusting hall we witnessed an unprofessional male staff member (an elusive manager perhaps?) screaming at the other staff members in front of guests Even though every person I know who stayed at the Hudson received $100-$200 off because of the horrendous conditions, I would never recommend the Hudson Hotel to anyone. Save your money. Stay anywhere else! One final note - the response by Hudson management to the many negative posts that they purposefully design the rooms to \"encourage\" guests not to want to spend any time in them is perhaps the most ludicrous thing I have ever heard. I honestly feel bad for the poor manager forced to rationalize the sorry, sorry state of the Hudson Hotel.", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bern, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cTerrible.

When you read other reviews that mention this - they are very correct; - RECEPTION staff are nice although they are not so good at answering the phones; - LOCATION IS SUPERB for all major tourist attractions - Central Park, Times Square, Broadway, 5th Avenue - NO MINI BAR - only communal vending machines out in the corridors. Not convenient when you want a quick snack and have to get dressed properly to get it. Machines do not stock any alcohol if you like a nightcap I suggest you bring your own. Drinks at the Hudson are RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE (although served with a smile!)!!! - SUGGEST you buy some bottle of water, snacks from the CVS Pharmacy which is very close by and store in your room; - NO KETTLE - so no hot drinks unless you buy from outside or in the restaurant (Hudson Hall) downstairs. I suppose the lack of kettle would not bother really trendy people - but as I am not a trendy person and like to be able to get a very quick hot drink when I wake up in the morning, this was a small issue; - I was lucky in that I had both a bath tub and a shower, but bathroom was very small. Two people could not use this at the same time; - HOTEL NEEDS A GOOD RE-FRESH. The decor is looking a little old, the carpet in the corridors is frayed. The hotel could do with shutting down for a few months and having a total refurbishment, fresh paint, deep cleaning etc.; - Corridors are DARK and SMELL TERRIBLE!; - Walls are very thin - hopefully you won't get a frisky couple staying in the room next door like I did! Suggest you bring your own EAR PLUGS or see whether you can compete with the noise ;-) - BREAKFAST - pricey and not a great selection, but freshly cooked. Chefs are very pleasant. Suggest you sample the many eateries outside though; - IN SUMMARY - OK hotel, expensive for the small space you get, not for those who like space and comfort (and bed ruffles/valances), great location...", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hartford, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cDark, dingy\u201d", "Author": "Musicbusiness", "ReviewID": "UR73640870", "Content": "What an unpleasant hotel this is!

The concierge area is dark but designed somewhat art deco with traditional mega chandeliers with light bulbs stuck to the tiers, there is a canopy of green that looks like combat camouflage enclosing the lobby as to not bring in the light from outside. Previous viewers mentioned that check-in was slow, not for us. There was 3 people on the desk and we were the only ones to check-in. We had booked our room on priceline for $150 a night for a Queen room, I knew the room was going to be small so asked about an upgrade. For an extra $100 a night we got a loft room on the 23rd floor, it was a corner suite with three exposures a living room area, bedroom area and two closets. The bathroom however was still small but suited the purpose. Although we didn't spend much time in the room, the afternoon break between sightseeing was nice in this spacious space with an amazing view. Very comfortable. The beds are ok, they are futon style. The pillows however are fluffy down filled and we had 10 of them. The room included, a safe, iron, mini bar, flat screen tv w/satellite viewing, bathrobes, aveda products and a small writing/computer desk. I think internet was $10 a day but we didn't use it. There is an apple store in Columbus Circle if you need to check something for free. Each floor has ice/food vending machines by the elevators. The elevators did move fast never waited more then a couple of minutes. Didn't try the restaurants since you are a close walk to 9th ave and there is ample cheap food finds there. The library bar was fun for a drink, so was the outside terrace (had one cocktail in each, a bit expensive $16 for a Sangria). The location can't be beat it is a close walk to Times Square/Central Park/Broadway etc. The subway entrance is across the street. There was a definate mix of young hipsters and middle age tourist (we are the latter). To end we did see our first room before upgrading just to see what small was!! The regular rooms are very small and if I had to stay there for 5 nights I don't think I would have been very delighted.

My room was not much larger than an expansive walk-in closet, but it was thoughtfully laid out and everything was clean. The bathroom was easy to navigate around in and had a near full size tub. Fluffy white towels. The room had a double bed and there was room enough to walk around. No way would a stroller work in there, but one or two people and room is fine. If you have more than one suitcase, you may have a problem. It was quiet and on the 14th floor. TV, but no DVD. After a day out on the town, the bed was comfortable and I just sank into those pillows. The restaurant served breakfast cafeteria style as one option and I had a problem with this. Someone kept taking my order! After the confusion, the pancakes are a must try. They were so tasty and just the right size. An order of bacon was just one strip though. The lobby is dark and for some of us this is puzzling, but there is a lot of activity at all times, even early in the morning. There are lots of places to sit in the lobby, lots of music, loud downstairs, but quiet in the rooms. For the amount of room space the hotel seems overpriced, but I had the parking package which made the room more reasonably priced, especially considering how close it was to Central Park and Columbus Circle, taxis, subways, buses.

Don't wait until arrival, as it's a very busy hotel, and you may not get what you need. Potential draw backs of the Hudson: For able bodied travelers: regular rooms are very small based on the dorm room/pod style, which translates to entire room being an 150 square foot size MAXIMUM. Internet pricing in the business center is a tad bit pricey for the time allowed. Business center is also a bit tricky to find. Lobby lighting is dim, mood lighting, so although there are stylish chairs and tables to relax in, it can be hard to read maps, menus, etc,. Also, on weekend nights, the lobby can be a bit crowded and loud. During my stay the restaurant(s) was/were under renovation. The neighborhood where the Hudson is located, between 8th and 9th Ave, is not my favorite. It's a bit far over on the West Side.

It was nice to have a room with atmosphere. There was a huge mirror in the room and one in the bathroom. There was plenty of hangin space and room to put our 4 suitcases!!! There was also a draw and a dressin table. The bathroom also have 3 shelves. There were some hangers in but i took some of my own anyhow. There was a TV with many channels and the opportunity to watch movies. There was a CD player and a hairdryer - which was amazin! I never used the one i took with me! So leave urs at home and save on weight! There was a lso an iron and alarm clock. The room was clean, the only dirty part was black marks in the toilet. The room was cleaned daily and fresh towels. The air com was noisy but did not prevent us sleeping.

The rest of the time there was no real noise disturbance. I loved the character of the room and was sad to have to leave it behind. The sky terrace was beautiful and the views were amazin! The rest of the hotel was dimly lit and was fine, but i reakon a little brighter lightin would be useful. It felt a little seedy at times! The drinks in the hotel are a total rip off!!!! BE CAREFUL! For one small glass of wine and a bottle of beer it was $24. The wine was \u00a310!!!!!!! Check out was 12pm and we didnt fly until the evenin. So we checked our bags into the hotel lobby.

Wonderful location. use the room just for sleeping or pitch a tent in the lobby On second thoughts the tent in the lobby would be the better option.

The location is fabulous--close to all New York has to offer, including Central Park and great restaurants. We easily walked/took subway everywhere we needed to go. The other reviews pretty much sum it up but I will give it my take--the common areas of the hotel are stunning and gorgeous. We enjoyed drinks out on the terrace (very overpriced ones, but hey, its New York) and the lobby is quite lovely. The common areas were always crowded with a good vibe. The service at the hotel was good and employees friendly. For the above reasons, I would recommend the hotel. But...oh my...the rooms are an absolute disappointment. You get to the room and it is basically a closet. Our room wasn't especially clean--mold in the shower and dusty. We have traveled all over the world and stayed in some very small rooms, but this room wins the ridculously tiny award. A person over 6 feet tall would not be able to use the toilet (I am 5'8\" and my husband 5\"11, average builds, and knees were hitting the wall) and would probably feel claustrophobic when in the room and bathroom. New York can be a very intense place, and when I go there I certainly do not hang out in the room, but it is nice to come back to one that is comfortable. The Hudson should really reconsider its configuration--given the good parts of the hotel, they could make the rooms bigger, charge a lot more, and it would be a great value. I hesitantly recommend the hotel...just don't be surprised when you open the door to your room and make sure you don't have problems with claustrophobia!", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Canada", "Title": "\u201cbell hops\u201d", "Author": "LRB7217", "ReviewID": "UR67135679", "Content": "They had to be the friendliest guys on our entire trip!

Priceline picked this hotel for us, and after booking I read the hotel reviews which made me very nervous about having to stay here. As you may know, Priceline does not allow cancellations. So we expected the worst and hoped for the best. The location is good, close to Central Park and we felt it was a safe area with easy access to public transportation. It is noisy due to traffic (people like to honk horns at all hours in NY City). I am a light sleeper, and earplugs helped reduce the noise. We were on the fourth floor and could not hear any music at all in our room from the hotel's nightclubs, although one night someone on our floor had a very loud party until about 2:30 a.m., but we did not complain since we were still up anyways. We were not allowed to reserve a non-smoking room in advance. We were told to ask when we checked in. Luckily when we checked in they had one left. But if they had not, we would have been quite upset since one of us is allergic to tobacco smoke. I would recommend to the hotel that they allow the option to reserve a non-smoking room in advance. My fears subsided some when we arrived and took in the outside surroundings and the really cool entrance and lobby inside. But I was still scared about the room. I was so relieved after we entered the room and inspected the bed sheets and bathroom and saw it was all just fine and clean. Our room had one queen size bed. The bed was average in terms of comfort. There was adequate room to stretch out and put all our luggage. The bathroom is tiny and does not allow for significant privacy from the rest of the room. I am a smaller person and imagined a much larger person would have difficulty using the toilet and sink. The building seems older but I thought the room was in good shape and decorated to match the urban chic theme of the hotel. Every single employee we ecountered gave excellent customer service. From the front desk to the maid service to the guys carrying our bags and hailing cabs for us. Top notch on every level. If you have a strong preference for more traditional/family style hotels, require larger bathrooms, or wish to have a more tranquil setting, then I would suggest stay somewhere else. If you are looking for a cool, unique hotel in a happening location, want a safe clean place at a decent value, then consider this hotel.

We had booked it at a steep discount based on a \u201csecret sale\u201d from Quikbook (similar to Priceline), and when I found out the hotel name and checked the reviews, I was a bit nervous. But really, for the price we paid, I thought it was a good deal. First, as others have said, be prepared for a *really* small room. Realistically it\u2019s meant for one short and very skinny person, but two people can stay here, as long as you don\u2019t have too much stuff and can tolerate extreme closeness and very little privacy. The room consisted of a queen bed, with maybe 2 feet of space on either side, small flat screen TV on the wall, and mirror on the other wall to prevent total claustrophobia. There is a tiny desk and a couple of drawers for clothes, plus an open closet and a few hooks on the wall. The bathroom is minuscule as well (I\u2019m 5\u20192\u201d and could just barely sit on the toilet with my knees in front of me). I had to change clothes in the little entryway. Whoever compared it to a cruise ship cabin is accurate. After my initial laughter at how small the room was, I began to reluctantly admire its efficient use of space. It wasn\u2019t brightly lit, especially with the dark wood paneling and flooring, and there is no natural light, but the lamps provided enough light to read a bit at night. The bed was low to the ground, but comfortable. Also, unlike others\u2019 experiences, our room, including the bathroom, was very clean and in good repair. That said, like a cruise ship cabin, a hotel room in NYC is just a place to stash your stuff and sleep when you\u2019re not out and about. So for that, it worked out fabulously. The location is fantastic - less than a block from the Columbus Circle subway station (and a short walk from several other stations) and easy walking distance to tons of restaurants and shops on the West Side. The Time Warner Center across the street has a huge Whole Foods in the basement, which is a great place to pick up breakfast or a quick lunch. I didn\u2019t find the location or the street seedy at all, even walking back by myself at night. We had very little interaction with the staff, who seemed typical of the snobby and inefficient staff present at most \u201ctrying to be boutique-y\u201d hotels. The drink prices at the hotel bars are outrageous, but I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised by that, it\u2019s New York and with so many other options no need to spend money there. The lobby had an unpleasant, mildewy smell so we didn\u2019t linger there either. Would I pay full price for a room here? Never! But would I stay here again for the right price? Yes.", "Date": "May 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cRooms are inferior quality and poor value for $$\u201d", "Author": "pinkissima", "ReviewID": "UR64803883", "Content": "As former NYC dwellers and current, regular visitors, we really appreciate the small size of the typical NYC hotel room; however, the Hudson Hotel rooms are well below the bar on this scale. From a trendy design perspective, the lower levels of the Hudson Hotel (i.e., bars, lounges, etc.) are well designed and executed. I have always liked people watching in the Hudson Hotel Bar and I love grabbing a drink at the library bar. I'm sad to say that the hotel rooms don't live up to the standards of the rest of the hotel. We stayed in a Deluxe King room, which was uber small and poorly conceptualized from a functional design perspective. The combination of these design flaws made the room feel cheap and gimmicky in my opinion. Pros: - Hudson Hotel Bar & Library Bar - Location, location, location Cons: - Ridiculously small rooms (i.e., the upgraded room fits a King Size bed with just enough space to walk around the bed on either side 1.5 ft, I'm guessing). There also is a small writing desk placed immediately at the foot of the bed, and a privacy curtain because the hotel door literally opens directly to the hotel bed. - Thin walls - because the rooms are small and there are thin walls you can hear people in the hallway walking and casually talking as if they were in your room. Not to mention what happens after hours with the inebriated guests return to their rooms between 2-5 am blissfully unaware they are waking other guests on the floor (and lets hope they don't after party in the room next to you...). Of course, this unlucky situation has occurred on two of my three of my trips to this hotel. - Tiny bathroom (i.e., an estimated 4' x 4' partition of the room). From a design concept, the open glass wall in the shower stall looking into the bedroom could have been really sexy, but the shower is so small that the curtains from either side of the shower (i.e., shower entrance and 'viewing window' curtain if open or closed) literally stick to your legs on either side while you're trying to shower, so you feel like you're trapped in wet blankets during your shower. Secondly, the shower curtains are so light and flimsy that loads of water escape on the bathroom floor during your shower, and extra towels are not provided (two per room). Third, you literally have to hurdle over the toilet in order to get to the shower. Fourth, there is no space for your legs between the toilet and the wall. I probably sound like a massive person to you by now, but keep in mind that as a 5'7'', size 4 female, I don't think at my size that I should have to sit on a toilet sideways to fit! - Bag service is a bit slow, but that is minor. Things to consider: - If you want a nice hotel in a good location, there are much better and more comfortable rooms in Midtown (even the Doubletree, Hilton, and Courtyard Marriott in midtown have nicer, larger rooms) or, if you want to keep the caliber of a nice, trendy hotel, there are other locations downtown that keep with the trendy vibe (i.e., Gramercy Park Hotel, SoHo Grand). - All trendiness considered, I actually prefer comfortable and functional rooms. So, from a quality of sleep perspective, the rooms at the above mentioned hotels are superior values for money, despite their mundane brand names. - This hotel may be good for you if you stay in NYC one night and plan to do nothing more than pass out in the bed and check out in the morning. With the lights out, the Hudson Hotel feels more like a trendy college dormitory hall than a trendy NYC hotel.", "Date": "May 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThe hotel lobby is too dark and the rooms...\u201d", "Author": "pdxhurricane", "ReviewID": "UR64724058", "Content": "The hotel lobby is too dark and the rooms are matchbox small.

I'm shocked they can get that rating for their rooms. I've been in small New York hotel rooms before, but the Hudson's priceline deal takes the cake. The hotel attempts to be modern and minimalist. It appears they spent all their money in the common areas. The main reception floor was nice enough, but our room really started to look like a room you could rent by the hour the longer we stayed it. First off, the rooms are so small that the doorways are also very narrow. The room was so small that we could not walk around the foot of the bed standing straight up for fear that we would knock off the flat screen with a horribly snowy picture and bad reception. in an attempt to make the room appear modern and larger, there are mirrors on either side of the room (one by the headboard and the other behind the tv). The wall separating the bathroom and the bedroom was also made of glass, so you could see someone having a bowel movement as you sat on the bed. Go figure! The pillow cases had some weird stains on it and also had holes. The mattress was so thin we could feel the springs as we laid on it. The bathroom tiles were cracked in places and the area under the spout looked like you could push right through the wall because of the number of large cracks in the tile. I travel quite a bit, and I never write bad reviews on tripadvisor. This is by far one of the worst hotels we've stayed at in over 10 years. The fact that the front desk staff seemed to care less if they had a long line of guests standing in line or waiting for them to get off the phone also did not help.

On the face of it the hotel doesn't look half bad. The lobby is clean and big. It took me a few minutes to find the hotel as there is nothing to indicate that this is a hotel. I actually went in once and came out thinking I had walked in to an apartment building by mistake. Once you get to the lobby. The lobby was very dim and dark. I found my self having to shuffle to a light to find my booking reference. After finally getting checked in, I headed up to my room on the 16th floor. It was a fair walk from the lift especiallt with all my bags and being as poorly lit as the lobby. I didn't once see a concierge to help. I found my room/cupboard. It was, by no exageration,... TINY! I couldn't get my case in the room past the door way so I left it there under the coat rack. As I was travelling with a friend I expected two beds. We had to share a \"double\" which it was barely big enough for one person. The floors and walls were wood-panneled, and they had even tried to create the illusion of space by having a big mirror to give the impression the room was larger than it was. I know some people must be thinking \"I bet this guy is some rich toff who travels 1st class\" etc. I am a student who is used to roughing it. I have to say I have seen better student halls than this hotel. Every thing about the room was cheap. From the decore to the bed sheets.

The bell staff were great - very friendly and knowledgeable about the city, and they helped keep our kids occupied as we checked in. The front desk staff were professional, friendly, and efficient - we were checked into our room very quickly. We were even upgraded to a room that had a little \"living room\" area, which was perfect for my kids to claim as their own. I had heard that the rooms in the Hudson Hotel were incredibly small, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the room fit our family of five, all our luggage and a baby crib in just fine. The bathroom was small but we still managed to bathe 3 children in it. Another bonus - as the hotel knew we were coming with a baby they provided a crib free of charge and also managed to find a small apartment style fridge for us to keep in our room so that we might keep milk for the baby cold. Whatever we needed, the staff at the Hudson Hotel were quick to accommodate us. The beds were so comfortable (queen size) and the pillows and linens were so soft it felt like I was in heaven. I could have slept for days in those beds! We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant - not only was the food on the buffet delicious but it had a good variety of things to choose from as well. The location was fantastic - only 2 blocks to Central Park (5 minute walk) and to loads of great shops! All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

The weather was roasting and we wanted to get some time on the skydeck (which is really fab) but there's just so much to see and do in NYC that we didn't get time.

After looking at the website, we both thought it looked great and booked it. They were offering a 15% discount on all pre paid reservations and as I had the money to pay for it straight away (back in January) we went for that option. I thought they would take the money almost straight away at the current exchange rate but they didn't actually take it until we checked out meaning because of the crappy exchange rate, I actually ended up paying around \u00a350 more for it!! The hotel itself is fairly impressive on arrival. Really funky and nice design. We knew from previous reviews that the rooms were small, and they really were, but to be honest all you do in New York is sleep and get changed in your hotel room so it didn't really bother us that much. Previous reports also said that the bed was uncomfortable but again, we found it absolutely fine and after a day/night out in NYC, you could sleep on a bed of nails you are so tired! The room was cleaned daily and when we had an issue with our power ( it completely cut out just in our room!) Housekeeping were very quick to send maintenance up who fixed it straight away. The bar was good, we went there on the first night and it is great for people watching. The bar service wasn't great though, waited for ages only for another couple to literally arrive at the bar and be served straight away. I soon told the wannabe model barman that actually we were there first and had been waiting for ages! We didn't really need to ask the staffs assistance on anything but they all seemed approachable and friendly enough. The downsides to this hotel is that it is very very noisy. We were on the 4th floor overlooking the garden area with a bar which is open until around mid night. This wasn't too much of an issue as we generally didn't get to bed until then but when you have the barmen clearing up with the music blaring, that poses a bit of an issue. The windows are so thin you would swear that they are actually open all the time! Another noise issue was the air con. It is so noisy all the time even when you don't actually have it on! The bathroom is very small and when you're over 6 foot, which my boyfriend is, it can be hard to even sit on the toilet!! There is also not a lot of room to put suitcases etc but again it wasn't too much of an issue. The lighting around the whole hotel is also very poor. They are obviously trying to create a mood with the lighting but it was actually pretty ridiculous! The hotel is in a great location though and only minutes from Columbus Circle. I wouldn't not recommend it and if you have already booked it I wouldn't freak out about the other reviews on here too much. New York is such an amazing city that you will not be in your room for very long at all as you won't want to miss a single second of what the city has to offer. A few of things we did whilst there:- Get a NYC Explorer pass, definitely a money saver. We chose the 3 trip pass and went on the Movie & TV Tour, Top of the Rock and Natural History Museum. All really good. The Top of the Rock was amazing as we had a brilliantly clear day! Bloomingdales and Macy's are a must, but do not miss out on Century 21 which is right next to Ground Zero. BIG discounts on designer bits! Whilst at Ground Zero, make sure you go into St Pauls Chapel. Whilst down that way, take a walk down Broadway to the Staten Island Ferry. This is free and will give you an excellent view of the Statue of Liberty. Takes 30 minutes to get out to Staten Island then you hop on the next one coming back to the city. We also went to see The Phantom of the Opera. You get discount tickets on the day at TKTS which is right in the middle of Times Square. Don't be put off by the queues, they move really quickly. We also took a carriage ride around Central Park which costs around $34 dollars for the shorter trip and $67 for the longer. The food is amazing and we didn't have a bad meal out there. Be warned, the portions are HUGE so only order 1 portion of chips or any other side order!! We ate in Asia De Cuba on Madison, this was amazing, Barolo in Little Italy, again the best pasta I've ever had! Planet Hollywood was good and Ruth's Chris Steakhouse was amazing!!!! If you can, also take a trip to the Mandarin Oriental Hotel on Columbus Circle. They have a bar on the 35th floor which has the most stunning views over the city. Go for brekkie or brunch at Sarabeths which is opposite the park, between 5th and 6th Avenue. I would recommend you get a taxi from and to the airport. They are set fares so you wont be ripped off and your driver will act as a mini tour guide! The cost is $60 dollars which is $45 for the fare, $5 for the toll and $10 for a tip. It takes around 30 minutes to get to the Hudson from JFK. We bought a 7 day Metrocard which was $27 dollars. This worked out to be really good value as you will hop on an off the subway all day. It can be a little confusing but we didn't get lost once! Also make sure you wear tried and tested shoes! Although you will use the subway a lot, you will also do a lot of walking!!! The people are unbelievably friendly, even random people on street or subway will take the time to speak with you if you need info. I was really impressed by this. I also didn't feel unsafe at all whilst there. New York is the most amazing place and it completely exceeded all my expectations. We had a great time and will definitely go back again.

During our first night in the hotel, we were woken up at 3.30 am by noise coming from the pipes. This continued all morning, meaning that we practically did not get any sleep from 3:30 onwards. We told the reception desk next morning, and they said that they were aware of the problem and that they would do something about it. Nothing happened. The next night it was the same. Again, we asked the reception to do something about it, we were told that they were working on it but nothing happened. The third time we complained we were finally offered a new room. We had to pack everything from our room ourselves, as the bell boy otherwise \u201dwouldn\u2019t move our stuff\u201d. We finally got a new room, and the receptionist ensured us that this was a quiet room. It was \u2013 until an aircon generator outside our window started making noise, which went on throughout the night. This noise was actually worse than the noise coming from the pipes! The aircon generator was on every night, meaning that we did not sleep well in this room either. We told the reception this, but simply couldn\u2019t spend more time packing, unpacking and getting a new room. When we had the first shower in the new room, we discovered that the drainage was blocked, meaning that the entire bathroom was flooded. We then decided to speak to the manager. He gave us another room which we could use for showering (we couldn\u2019t be moved to this room as it was only a double room), and told housekeeping to clean up the mess in the bathroom. This was at 7pm in the afternoon. We left for dinner around 8, where we asked the reception to make sure that 1) the bathroom was cleaned, 2) that we had two extra duvets when we came home. We saw the receptionist write this down. When we came back from dinner around midnight, the bathroom was not cleaned and we didn\u2019t have extra duvets. Again, we asked to speak with a manager, but regardless we had to wait 1\u00bd hour for the bathroom to be cleaned and the housekeeping to provide us with extra duvets. When the duvets finally arrived, we had to put on the bed sheets ourselves. We sat in the hotel bar waiting, but weren\u2019t offered anything to drink, snacks etc. \u2013 we had to buy those ourselves. Also the manager on duty did not really seem to care about the problem and was actually a bit rude. The next day, when we came home in the afternoon, the duvets were removed. We called the reception and asked them to bring back the duvets. Afterwards we got a very rude call from housekeeping, insisting that we should have told them or left a note that we wanted to keep the duvets and now it was a problem for them to give us new duvets. We had to tell them quite bluntly that this was not our problem and they would have to fix it. We were promised a compensation of two nights for all the hassle we had been through, but when the bill arrived we were only given one night. We had to discuss this (again) with a manager, as no-one apparently bothered to write these things down. What I don\u2019t get is that we spoke with the receptionists almost daily \u2013 and yet, it was like no-one had ever heard about the many problems we had with our room(s) when we approached them! Unless it is common that all guests have a multitude of problems, I would assume that when we said our room number the receptionists would be extra aware to ensure that future requests went as smooth as possible, given all the problems that we\u2019d already had. The final straw was the bell boy, who offered to find us a cab big enough for four. He did that and we told him several times that we were going to Newark. He talked to the cab driver, and we got into the cab. After a while we started to wonder which direction the cab driver was taking us and asked him. He then tells us that he was instructed to go to JFK! All in all, we spent time every day debating something with receptionists, housekeeping, or a manager. We probably spoke with 10-15 different people during our 5-day stay - including 5 different managers! Only two of the managers and one of the receptionists listened to our complaints, the rest looked like they couldn\u2019t be bothered. It simply can\u2019t be right that we had to spend so much time asking for basic things that could have been fixed in a very short time. I don\u2019t think it ever happened that we got what we asked for the first time around \u2013 we usually had to approach the reception 3-4 times, and/or ask to speak with a manager, before anything happened. One of us have stayed at the Hudson Hotel once before and was very happy with her stay back then. But frankly, after this experience I doubt that any of us would want to stay at the Hudson Hotel again.

Oh and I was traveling this time with my little brother who is 14 so I have both the adult and child point of view! Pros: *GREAT LOCATION! This is the spot to be in my mind! You are a block away from Central Park, a few blocks from Times Square and just a great spot!!! *People complained about the noise but I didn't hear anything at all and I'm a light sleeper. We were on the 12th floor so maybe that helped but it was fine by me. *Very helpful staff - always willing to give recommendations and just helpful overall. *Nice main areas - terrace, library etc. *Again I can't say enough about how great this location was...we were literally in our room from 2am -8am every night, so really for such a short amount of time, who cares about anything else??? Cons: *Ok, the room is small there is no lie about that - but it's NYC...really what do you expect in this price range and at this location. For us the room was a fine size, but I do think keeping the room and your stuff neat and orderly helps. *Bathroom is really ackward b/c there is a window in the shower to the room - they have drapes so someone can't see you shower but it's still weird *A few times when we needed something from housekeeping it took longer then I'd like but we did always eventually get what we requested. I would highly recommend going to Pinkberry for snacks or a quick lunch - it's literally down the street from the hotel. Check out their website - it's frozen yo with great toppings etc...hard to explain but a great NYC thing. Also the BEST meal we had of the whole trip was at Mia Dona at 206 E. 58th Street (so just down the street from the hotel but on the East side).

THE LIGHTING: they seem to have attempted to be hip and cool with their lighting, but it was so dim that trying to read was next to impossible; and in the bathroom I could barely see to put my make-up on. THE BATHROOM: very, very odd; the bathtub/shower had a large picture window in it facing into the bedroom; you could wave (or whatever <g>) to your partner while showering! I truly have never seen anything quite like that and still cannot fathom WHY they would have done this (to make the room appear larger??!!) - VERY, VERY bizarre! The room was unbearably HOT except for a small vent which was behind the headboard of the bed, so none of the cool air circulated into the room. We often had to go and just stand right above it to try and cool off. There are ice machines on each floor but no ice bucket in the room; I always travel with some Ziploc bags so got some ice in one of them - I was totally grossed out the next morning when I looked at the bag of melted ice, and it was literally filled with dirt and mildew; it would appear that they don't clean the ice machines too frequently. The elevators were always full and cramped, so you often had to wait for several elevators to pass you by before one arrived with space to crowd into. I will attempt to address a few \"positives\" of this place: all of the very young staff were very friendly, polite & helpful. The lobby is very attractive but also VERY loud because of a nightclub/bar very popular with young singles located RIGHT ACROSS from reception.

I was with friends and we had a double room which was pretty big for New York hotels. The room was well decorated (as was the rest of the hotel), the garden bar was fantastic, the roof top lounge was gorgeous and overall my experience was great. I decided to visit the Hudson one last time for a weekend two years later, and unfortunately that pleasant first experience was completely erased from my mind. First there was a 25 minute line just to check in (mind you this is at 11pm). At the check in, the staff member told us, without us asking, that the complimentary breakfast was from 7-11am. The next day AFTER having breakfast we learned that no, it wasn't so complimentary and that we had to pay $42 each for a subpar buffet. The funny thing is, our friends checked in at a different time and with another staff member and were told the same. When we confronted the manager about the deception, we were told that all 5 of us had misheard what the staff had said. I had a queen standard room this time, which is literally the size of a closet. I'm not one to feel claustrophobic, but the size of the room leaves you feeling like a sardine in a can. It is so small I had to constantly put things back in my bag so I could walk around the room. The room looked worn out, the furniture was all nicked and scratched. Soon after settling into the room the radiator began making loud noises, which we hoped would go away. Well, it didn't, and I couldn't fall asleep. At 3am I had to call the front desk and ask for someone to come fix the radiator. Minutes later a drunk staff member comes to my room (yes, he was drunk as his eyes were rolling back and he could barely stand up straight) and tells me all he can do is shut off the water to all the radiators in that area so that the noise will stop. The noise soon stopped and I was able to finally fall asleep. The next day we switched rooms as the radiator began making noises once again (after waiting for 20 minutes on the phone for the front desk to answer, of course). The Hudson is NOT what it used to be. The hotel is falling apart and cannot maintain its boutique hotel image anymore. What once felt glamorous and hip, now feels dated and dull. The service is the worst I have seen in a long time. No one should have to wait 25 minutes in line to check in. No one should have to wait 20 minutes on the phone in order to reach the front desk. The staff should not deceive the guests about complimentary breakfasts. To the management: If you don't have money to fix up your decaying infrastructure or to expand your rooms, focus on a spotless service and the guests won't notice your flaws.

Just figured that since our stay @ The Morgan hotel last year was comfortable and nice that this hotel of the same brand would be as well. Not so much. It was super small. So much so that my boyfriend and I had to completely stand out of each other's way to manuever throughout the room. Leaving the shower to get to the bed I had to crouch and scoot between the wall and bed. The beds were not all that cozy. I'm not a fan of the sheets only bed so I called down to housekeeping was they sent me a blanket up very quickly. That is probably the only good thing I have to say at all about The Hudson. The staff was super nice. Everyone we saw smiled and seemed genuinely warm and eager to help. Back to the room though...So the lighting is bad. Not like office lights, dressing room bad, I mean to say there is literally no real lights in the room. There were these decorative lights along the bed and one dim light over the from door and another dim light in the bathroom. There was a lamp on the desk but that light didn't work. I dont' know how I got dressed for the show we went to that evening. Between the non-existent lighting and the lack of mirrors and me shuffling to move around the room it was frustrating. The bathroom mirror consisted of a window which had been converted into a mirror. It of course was all steamed up. The only other mirror was a wall mirror that had a flat screen tv posted squarely in the middle of it. Not long after we arrived, I did go and inquire up a room upgrade and was told for an additional $120 we could have a bigger room. I declined as we were only staying one night. This was the first time I'd stayed in a hotel and couldn't wait to get out of it. The conceierge while nice gave us the wrong directions and that made us 20 minutes late for our show. We returned after the show, changed and went back out for the rest of the evening. There was a party going on when we returned so we hit the bar. Thanks for the 2 glasses of house wine for $30 Mr. Bartender. I know this is the big city and all, but $30???!!!! I didn't ask for any special brand just a chardonnay and a merlot.

After calling, the concierge staff were pretty brisk and not that friendly. I work in the hotel business and was very surprised at this. After arriving, the welcome was ok. Again quite brisk - working for hotels in Florida and Mauritius, all the staff at my hotels would not get awat with that! Anyway - we loved the hotel immediatley. Great location, very cool and good atmosphere. Our room was tiny but we knew that. I think the biggest shock was the bathroom. Sitting on the toilet - our kneeds touched the wall in front! Could have done with bigger towels and the shower head to be removable so I could have a shower without getting my hair wet (no shower caps). Bed comfortable although the AC/Heating is behind the headboard so it is a little noisy. We got used it to so no worries for us! The room walls are a bit thin and the 2nd night we did hear the bar music but so tired we fell asleep not to long after. I think a kettle/tea/coffee would have been nice but there is a drink, ice and snack station on every floor. Hairdryer needed replacing as it was hot/cold/hot/cold - not consstent heat. When I told reception they didnt believe me and send another one to the room. The same thing happend so I just let it dry naturally instead - couldnt be bothered to complain again. The bar is great - we loved it on our 1st night! Good music and a local crowd. I would have liked the table my husband tried to organise as we were stood up for ages. Apart from that, was a good place to start out before heading to Pacha. Location excellend! Right on the red line (1) to get down to times sq, midtown and lower manhattan. Times Warner Centre is literally 2 mins walk and we had a great meal here at Porterhouse and drinks at Stone Rose bar. Also close to central park and the lovely shops around here. Broadway/Macy's area is a bit touristy and tacky with beggars etc so this was perfect! We defintley want to come back and stay at the Hudson - I just think the staff need to cheer up a little and be more friendly, the hairdryers need looking at and they should make a fuss of you on a special occasion! You only turn 30 once! We will try to book a higher category of room so we have more space and a shower over bath would be nice.

We spent 3 nights at The Hudson and it was our first trip to New York, so we were as green as hell! Travelled from JFK in a taxi. We knew the price in advance as it is set to Manahattan and well published on the internet guides i.e. $45 + $5 toll plus (in our case) $10 tip. It took about 40 mins. Driver knew The Hudson location. There was one, possibly two, guys right outside what turned out to be the un-signed main entrance (although it felt like the side door with a few large potted trees each side). They asked if I needed help with cases. I did not and I declined. My main point here is these guys had no identification displayed, no uniforms and did not say they were working for the hotel.Given that we thought this was a side entrance and the area is not overlooked by the reception or other staffed area, I wondered if these guys were officially associated with the hotel. I later found out they were.But I would suggest to management that there guys wear badges, or is that just too un-hip? The escalator to the lobby & reception was different and quite cool. We tried to check in too early i.e. before 3.00pm, that was probably our mistake by not reading some small print. It was not a big problem, as we stowed the cases in the hotel (free) and shot off to fully enjoy the afternoon. Having said that, it would have been ideal for a quick freshen up after a long trip from the UK- but we were so exited it was not a high priority- but, as a sugestion to the management, is there scope for a 'freshen up' room (not a general rest room/ toilet) for guests who arrive before 3pm? Much later, we returned to fully check in, no problems there, very polite staff. The reception area is very nice and moodily lit, if I can put it like that. The receptionist rung down to the bagage stowing department and instructed them to bring our cases up to our room. When we got there, we had to ring down to chase them though and our wait was about 25 mins- no big deal in the grand scale of things. The corridors en-route to our room were moodily lit again- but not in a good way as per the lobby and other ground floor areas such as the bar. Just plain dark green walls- no pictures etc. I speculated over what they were trying to achieve here, or even hide ! Having watched too much US TV in my time, I was waiting for a cop to come bounding up the corridor and shoot the hinges off one of the room doors to gain access to some low life perp. inside !! We expected the suite to be small (having read reviews on this site) and it was, but not too small for our needs. By that I mean we were hardly there anyway. We did not eat there at all, prefering to experience what the city beyond had too offer. I did buy one cocktail and a small bottle of beer one evening as we returned late. $26 !!!. The barman was not overly interested in my request for him to recommend a cocktail for my wife, as I had no clue about these types of drink. He just handed me the menue (no prices displayed) and walked away. Yes, it's a trendy hotel and bar etc. But it's not 5 star with the overtly rich as their bread and butter customers (Having seen our room size, I speculate that they surely stay elsewhere). So I felt he could have been a bit more helpful and even a little interested, or is that too un-hip also? Having read a couple of reviews about the alledgedly dirty rooms, I was relieved to see ours had no such issues at all- very clean. The room staff we bumped into each day were poilite and always said \"good morning \" etc. We had no hair dryer, but a quick call resolved this, although I wonder if I should have tipped the guy who brought it up ! We had no bath robes, although they were on the inventory list. So the tip here is, make sure you have everything from the outset, or risk being charged for missing items. I told the receptionist about the robes as we were leaving, so if they feature on a future credit card bill I will not be happy ! One major issue for me was the fact that the room safe was not bolted to a wall or the interior of the cupboard it was in. It was small enough to just walk out with it under a coat, or in a box etc. I have never seen an un-secured safe in a hotel. So I didn't use it. I was very aware that absolutely anyone could access the hotel interior from the street without being spotted, let alone engaged, by staff. And what with all the dim lighting, I would imagine if thieves were going focuss on this potential method of theft, then this hotel would be an easier proposition. Yes, you could argue that even secured safes could still be ripped out, but I would suggest back that thieves are less likely to target those than ones you can just lift out, making much less noise and taking a fraction of the time.And yes, kicking the doors in would make noise, but I'm guessing city thieves nowadays have a way of breaching hotel doors without the use of force. Management will probably say this has never happened. Fair enough, but I was not going to be the first victim, partuicularly as all losses would have been mine, not the hotel. Yes, as per other reviews, the toilet was close to a wall. But I was OK for leg room wise ( I am just ovr 6 feet tall). The main isue for me was the design. The seat hole was just not long enough. But we managed OK. I'm not a huge fan of beds close to the floor, and ours was. And I too, like a previous contributor, banged my head on the wall mounted TV when getting out of bed one morning. But I only did it once, unlike the previous guy! The heating system was noisy, but only background noise. Not a problem for me personally. We were on 14th floor, so that was the loudest thing we had to hear at night. I could not hear our neighbours, but then I don't think we had any! We were luck with our views, included the Hudson River. Checking out was easy, we had no extras bill to pay, so we just left our keys in the room and left. The door guy hailed a taxi for us right outside. Overall, I would say I would be happy to stay at The Hudson again. Location was great, very handy.

Guys on the front door were really helpful and on our first day gave us loads of advice on where to go etc. The hotel is very trendy, lovely reception area with a gorgeous chadelier, lobby was lovely too and the library bar was lovely for an early evening drink and a game of pool. Drinks however were slightly expensive, especially the wine but we found this to be the case in NYC. Room was lovely and clean although small but we knew this already from previous reviews so we weren't disappointed, room was a lot nicer than I thought it was going to be actually and it was cleaned every day. The staff at the concierge desk were really helpful too and sent us to some fab restaurants! BLT Market is a must, not far at all from the Hudson. We found the hotel to be in the perfect location, not too far from times square but far enough away to be away from it all. Sushi damo along from the Hotel is a lovely sushi restaurant/bar which is great for a few early evening drinks too. We had a fantastic holiday and couldn't fault one thing about the holiday or the hotel, we shall definately return to NYC in the future and hopefully it will be staying at the Hudson too.

I should have taken one! There were some cons, remote control was not working, I am a fan of switching channels so to me that kind of bothered me but we were not in our room long enough to really give me time to call housekeeping. Hardwood floor, it seems they replaced some boards but did not measure correctly and there were gaps. Watch your heels!

Upon entry, the lobby is quite impressive as you go up the escalator. Front desk staff wear black and look like models. They're not overly friendly but not rude either. The hallways are very dark, almost scary. As you walk to your room, you may encounter very dark hallway which presumably go to stairwells or to housekeeping closets. Its so dark, someone could easily be hiding there and you wouldn't know it. I don't know why they keep it so dark - is it to save on electricity bills or so you don't notice the shabby hallway carpet?! The last time I stayed here, their reservation systems were down so they upgraded my room from a single queen to a double queen. What a difference that made! The single queen room is quite small. There is very little walking space between the bed and the wall. The theme of low lighting is continued from the hallway to your room. Considering the walls are a dark wood paneling, it feels very cave like. The bathroom on the other hand is clinical - with its bright white tiling and stainless steel furnishings. The positioning of the toilet in the single queen room is very close to the wall. I don't know how anyone who is taller than 5'7\" could comfortably \"do their business\" without knocking their knees on the wall in front of the toilet. The hotel tries to address claustrophobic tendencies by having the mini bathtub/shower stall open to the bedroom area, separated by a glass wall. The larger room with 2 beds is way more spacious but it comes at a cost. The walls and doors are pretty thin. You can hear people showering and watching TV as you walk by their rooms. The TV is pretty small and its not a flat screen. I expect higher quality furnishings from a \"hip & trendy \" hotel. The Cafeteria restaurant downstairs serves excellent food, although its a bit overpriced. But then again, it IS a hotel restaurant and those tend to be overpriced. The location is excellent, a couple blocks from Central Park. The Time Warner building is across the street from the hotel - you can access the subway from here and if you want a quick bite, there's also a Whole Foods downstairs which has an extensive salad / hot foods bar. If you have a sweet tooth, there's a Pinkberry a few doors down. This hotel is not suited for families - I've never seen anyone under the age of 20 staying here.

It is a trendy hotel designed by Philippe Stark and boasts a very popular lobby bar. As you enter the hotel, the vine-walled lobby is impressive as you come up the escalator. Check-in was fine and the good stops there. The room is about 100 square feet in size, comparable, but smaller, than an inside cabin on a cruise ship. The room is about 8 feet wide, a strip of about 18 inches around the bed to the wall. The TV is on the side wall, so you have to crane your neck to watch the TV, but it is a nice flat screen. There is a safe in the room, a radio and CD player, an alarm clock. The bed is hard but comfortable, big enough for two regular-sized people. Our view was of another building and no light came into the room, making the in-room lighting essential. I hit my head on the hanging TV at least five times, getting up in the night because of its placement next to the bed. That and the knocking that came from the heating unit made sleep a bit rough. In addition, despite setting the temperature at 68, it seemed like it was 80 degrees in my room all night. The bathroom is about 10 square feet, if that! When sitting on the toilet, I had to place my legs to the side because there was not enough room to sit straight, due to the proximity of the wall. When facing the toilet, the blow dryer hanging on the wall made me have to lean forward slightly. The shower has good water pressure and plenty of hot water, but is so small. It has hanging fabric on both sides, and as you wash, the fabric is touching you. Standing at the sink is a little easier, as there is enough room to actually wash your hands. There is no closet, but there is a small area near the door to hand a few things and stash your bags. There are also hooks on the wall. The telephone was broken for the duration of my stay. I have stayed in small rooms before and for the amount I paid, 90 on priceline, it was fine, but honestly, if comfort is your thing, this hotel is not for you.

It's worth shopping around for deals, as we managed to get one with breakfast included, and I had the best yoghurt of my life, though it was a little disconcerting to eat it in a yellow floor-lit club environment.

As a \u201cnative,\u201d I had seen the public spaces in this hotel before, and they are gorgeous \u2013 from the ivy-draped lobby check-in area to the chic, floor-lit bar area to the fireplace lounge \u2013 very inviting on a cold winter night. We could also see the beautiful outdoor space through the lobby windows \u2013 though with temperatures in the 20s, it was a feature we didn\u2019t actually see in person. The actual restaurant in the hotel is currently closed for renovation. The staff, though beautiful and chic as the hotel, are warm, service oriented, polite and accommodating. Joe at the front desk helped us with check-in and gave us a room toward the top of the hotel with a lovely Hudson River view. Everyone we encountered, in fact, from the doormen to the bartender, was polite and helpful. Young, thin, fabulous people straight out of central casting wander the lobby and a few were draped over the leather chairs and sofas, asleep, early on a Monday morning. We stopped in the bar for a nightcap on the first night and got immediate sticker shock from the $15 price tag for top shelf drinks \u2013 not specialty drinks or anything, just top shelf liquor \u2013 and we are both city people who\u2019ve been around the block a few times. They also offer a $28 breakfast buffet in the bar in the mornings (and complimentary coffee to go for hotel guests). It\u2019s a space worth checking out \u2013 just be ready for the price. Now to the rooms. Let\u2019s just say this is not a hotel for your ordinary, generously sized middle aged business person who needs to get some work done and relax in the room between meetings \u2013 or anyone with claustrophobia. Though they are well thought-out and designed, the rooms are tiny \u2013 and that\u2019s generous. In our queen room, there was approximately 12-18\u201d on either side of the bed, and about the same at the foot of the bed \u2013 that is it in terms of floor space in the main area. There's a small hallway to the bathroom with a closet and 3 small hooks on the wall, good for coats, etc. The bathroom is so small that anyone over about 5\u201d 9\u201d would bang their knees on the wall when sitting on the toilet. There is a small desk, a small closet and a tall, thin cabinet that houses a safe (not large enough for a laptop), an older model stereo (I saw no iPod dock in the room though others have mentioned them), one drawer and 3 small shelves. It also looks like it once housed a tiny television. In an ingenious design move, the two walls on either side of the bed are mirrored to give a slightly more open feeling. On one wall, however, the mirror has a cutout that is retrofitted with a flat screen TV on an adjustable arm, which obscures part of the mirror and makes It awkward to walk beside the bed on that side. The platform bed is firm and comfortable \u2013 both of us slept pretty well. The bathroom has standard amenities-soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, all natural products, and three decent sized shelves for toiletries. For two friends sharing a room, the \u201copen\u201d shower was disconcerting \u2013 it has a window with a sheer curtain that faces into the room. It provides light and a more open feeling to the bathroom, but not much in the way of privacy. Also, our room had a shower in a tiny bathtub \u2013 but if you want a luxurious bath, this is not the place. There\u2019s no coffee maker (you can get coffee downstairs easily, though), refrigerator or other amenities to keep you in the room. There is an iron and a tiny ironing board. In short, this is a hotel for the young, thin and hip, who plan to spend days sightseeing and nights clubbing. The hotel\u2019s location is ideal for both.

I booked via Hotwire - which turned out to be a bit of a disaster and would not do so again - anyway we ended up with Hudson for 6 nights in late December / early January. OK, the good points. The hotel is very well located and especially close to Columbus Circle subway which connects to many of the main subway lines. Staff, by and large were friendly and helpful, albeit in a rather clueless way at times. Not really sure that there is anything else good. Bad or just OK points. this actually worked out quite expensive. Hotwire only give you a double room (the size of a matchbox) and since i did not want to sleep with my (male) friend i had to \"upgrade\" the room which cost an extra $140 a night on top of the $220 we had already paid. The first night they had no twin rooms available but put us in a suite with the promise of putting a folding bed (cot) there for one night before finding us a twin room the following day. It took over six hours for them to bring the folding bed despite me having to ask about 6 times and it was only when i had a showdown with one of the receptionists that they finally brought it up. Decor. I have to say this is the darkest, most depressing decor i have ever experienced. The thing about boutique hotels is that they are always someone else's idea of style/good taste and i am afraid that the Hudson is stuck in the mid 1990s and is now really passe. I see now why the chain hotels (Holiday Inn) etc go for the bland and inoffensive - would way prefer this over the darkness of the Hudson any day. The place is so dark it is impossible to actually do anything like read etc., it would be impossible to use this as a business hotel. Very noisy at night from the bar downstairs which turns into some kind of club. way overpriced drink eg bottle of corona in the Library Bar is $9. Rooms: suite was OK, but seats - sofa and chair were not actually designed for sitting on and were also tiny. TV volume was restricted to such a low level you could barely hear it; some dodgy looking electrical wiring sticking out of the walls; mini bar ridiculously expensive so didn't us it; bathroom miniscule barely enough room to turn around; really gloomy and dark with faux wood pannelling which made me want to scream everytime i looked at it; noisy room if you get one looking down on street. Room not turned down until the second day. Twin Room: we were moved to a twin room for the last four days. Overall, a bit better than the suite but still dark and gloomy. Two of the lamps in the room did not work, including the ipod music player thing; no seating area so you had to sit or lie on the bed the whole time; bigger bathroom and shower; the room was really draughty from an ill-fitting window which i attempted to block off with towels and extra pillows. Worked a bit, but was still cold and you could feel the wind on your face; door lock on bathroom door broken. overall quite a tatty room and you could never be sure whether something was going to work or not. Overall, this is a hotel that is past it really. It is an attempt at style over substance, but the style is gloomy and depressing and is just really dated now.

This is expecially crucial if I have booked a room on Priceline (as in this case). I want to correctly set my expectations prior to arrival. For instance, I really had to get myself in the SMALL ROOM mindset before checking in at The Hudson. Arrival: The hotel doesn't have a sign. Be sure to look at the pics on the website so you know where you're going if you are coming in via subway train. There was a small line at check-in but the front desk staff did a great job keeping everyone moving. There was one very important woman (a trendy I-think-I'm-20-but-I-am-really-45) who felt compelled to jump to the front \"Just to ask a question\" which of course was her attempt to jump the line. No go! Yay front desk. I made a joke and they took pity on us and got us into a higher level room facing the atrium. :-) Score! The room: Ok. We know. It's small. It's not the end of the world. Unpack your stuff. Be organized and you have plenty of room. Don't throw you stuff all over the room. Now you'll need to sit on the toilet sideways and take turns in the bathroom but....the good parts? Incredible water pressure and a roomy shower plus a VERY comfortable bed. You didn't come to New York to hang out in your hotel room did you? Well then, the shower and the bed are top notch. Done. My husband and I slept like logs in a Queen size which is usually a challenge. I think its really all about the pillows. Noise: Try to get a room above the 6th floor. There will be street noise. It's NY. Buy some freaking Tylenol PM if it's that big of deal. The bigger issue is the nightclub. It's loud. Very loud and very popular. Therefore if you are below Floor 6, you will probably hear it. Join the fun or get something to knock yourself out. Location: As they say in real estate....This is a superb location. The subway is very close and can get you where you need to go quickly. We walked down Columbus Ave after visiting the Natural History Museum and really enjoyed it. Great shops, bars and restaurants al the way down. Lots of dogs and locals give it a nice neighborhood feel. There's a great 24 hour diner and pizza place right on the corner of 58th and 9th. Both are open late. We enjoyed our stay very much. Appreciated the thought and design work that went into the place.

When we first arrived at the hotel, we stood in one of several lines for almost 40 minutes, waiting to check in. My husband and I noticed that almost every single person talking to someone behind the desk was complaining about something. We couldn't believe how long it was taking to simply check in. When we finally got to the desk, the person behind it didn't even apologize for our wait. He, like the rest of the staff, looked bored, unenthusiastic, and grim. What a way to welcome your guests! From the doormen (aspiring models, I assume?) and concierge, to the check-in staff, everyone just seemed clueless. Anyway, we got our room key and walked down the aforementioned hallways, which looked straight out of a horror film. I get it\u2014you're trying to be minimalistic. Then we got to our room, which you couldn't really call a room\u2014more like a broom closet. The bathroom is obscenely tiny, so anyone over 5\"4 should avoid this place at all costs.They put us on the 4th floor, where you couldn't avoid the horrendous traffic noise outside. I couldn't sleep the first night. To top things off, we found a dead COCKROACH in our bathroom. We asked to change rooms the next day and again, the woman behind the desk gave us no apologies when they \"upgraded\" us to another crappy room. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SERVICE! If you're a tourist who plans to party all weekend, this place is definitely for you. (But don't have the wine at the bar. Their selection is awful.) You'll also be sure to run into drunk people in the elevator. It's like being in Vegas!

Cons - Service is not good in this hotel, especially at the front desk, which I found sloppy and pretty unprofessional. There was no polish to the service. The staff didn't really seem like they cared about the hotel guest's experience. - Bar prices are far too high - $9 for a bottle of beer... - Bathrooms are not very good at all although there are decent showers. They're a bit cheap looking. - Rooms have a safe but it's not bolted down, therefore a waste of time - No fridges in rooms - $7.50 for a bottle of water in your room, if you can't be bothered going out to buy it - Sound insulation is rubbish. I did not get a single night's undisturbed sleep. I was woken up by the noise of other guests opening and closing their doors. Overall I would say some people would like this hotel - if they hadn't stayed in a good hotel before. It's very much a 3* hotel in my book and I wouldn't recommend it to friends. NY has loads of hotels, many in great locations and this hotel lacks features to make it stand out from the crowd.

USD 495 for a tiny room with no mini-bar and minimal service is neither Cheap nor Chic to me.\u2026 I get the feeling that the Hudson is more filled more by Priceline than Facebook or the hip and well heeled.

I knew exactly what to expect when I arrived. Yes, the room is small, so what? My room at home is certainly bigger but when I travel I dont expect a suite, unless I pay for it. I definitely prefer a small room in a modern, clean hotel than a bigger room in an old fashioned, old looking hotel. To be honest, the room felt cosy after all. We didnt have any problem storing our shopping bags, and we did a lot of shopping. There is a small wardrobe were you can place your luggage, and a few hangers for your clothes, and you can place all your shopping on an upper shelf. It is a matter of being a bit organised. The bathroom is small but again, I dont need anything else apart from it being clean. It even fits a bathtub. Good TV and stereo (which we didnt use). After reading many reviews I can say that you cannot blame he hotel for other guests banging doors etc. While in the room you cannot hear your fellow guests next door. Downsides: windows should be double glazed to avoid the noise coming from the street, even on the 19th floor you can hear the traffic. We were given room 543 upon arrival, and we had to change the next morning since right outside were lots of huge AC machines which made lots of noise. The hotel should not sell that room, you cannot sleep there. It feels like you are on a plane with that constant buzzing. But again, newxt morning we were given a room on he 19th floor and no problem. It is true that the AC in the room is very noisy. Other stuff: the common areas are spectacular, the library room is fantastic, and so is the roof terrace. Yes, drinks are not cheap, but you are in NYC, in a great roof terrace on the 15th floor, how much are you willing to pay? I have paid more money for a drink in a lot less fancier bars, so I recommend it, at least once you have to experience it at night. By the way, I never heard any noises coming from the club in the room. Staff were helpful when we needed any assistance, no delay in either check in or out. And the location is just great, you can walk to Times Sq in 10-15 min, and you are right at the entrance of Central Park. Walking distance to most sites. And also Columbus Circle subway station will take you to many other places without having to chang trains, although beware since the subway is a bit tricky and you have to use different entrances to different lines. Around the hotel you have many places to have bfast, so I wouldnt pay 25$ at the hotel. I so recommend the Hudson, but of course deppending on the rate you are paying.

If you are taller than 6 feet you also will likely not be able to sit on the toilet as your knees will hit the wall in front of you. So aside from the small room here are my thoughts: Pros: - Very cool atmosphere, if you go be sure to check out the rooftop patio & courtyard bars - Impressive lobby - Decent price ($175 per night plus a $50 per day room credit to use in the hotel because of the package we selected) - Modern & trendy decor - Friendly concierge & front desk staff - We did not see this until it was too late but appreantly there is a really hip nightclub in the hotel on certain evenings (would have been good to mention upon our arrival) - Across the street from subway system, lots of stores and food options nearby, close to Central Park & within walking distance to Times Square Cons: - Price of food & drink (two mixed drinks cost $40 with tip and breakfast for two people was $50 daily) - It is extermely dark throughout the hotel including the rooms - Room was a bit noisy, we could hear doors slamming throughout the night & morning - Room floors looked like they had not been cleaned in months - Service slow at bars & restaurants Overall our stay was fair, we luckily did not spend much time in our hotel room, it was cramped for two people especially after a few shopping bags were added to the room. If you can afford a larger room I would consider that option. If we had not had the $50 room credit I would not have eaten at the restaurant for breakfast every day, the food was good but not worth $25 per plate.", "Date": "August 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cHip Dormitory\u201d", "Author": "edsh", "ReviewID": "UR37831070", "Content": "If this hotel used to be a college dormitory, it shows in the rooms.

A few weeks before sleeping at the hotels we made phonecalls to ask for double bedrooms, there was no problem at all until we called the Hudson hotel. A kind of unfriendly lady told us it would be impossible to sleep in a double bedroom even when we offered to pay for an upgrade. When arrived at the hotel we kindly asked again for an upgrade to a double bedroom, unfortunately all the rooms were occupied but the lady offered us an alternative (kind of strange since it was impossible to upgrade by phone). We could upgrade for $40 a night to a deluxe room which was equipped with a queen bed (which should be larger than the regular one). This was the only option to sleep seperately because this room was spacy enough to equip with a roll-in bed that she could arrange. Unfortunately the bed wasn't arrived after 3 hours and we had to ask it again for 3 times before the bed was rolled in. Well, we don't understand how you can equip a room with such a tiny queen bed. I'm 6 foot 5 and I don't even fit in the bed, my best guess is that the bed is about 6 foot 3. So if you are taller than 6 foot it would already be too small. The roll-in bed is a joke.

Overall, I was satisfied, but my husband not. Here are a few points: - Great location: 1 minute walk from Columbus Circle metro station, serving a few metro train lines, including Line A which will take you directly to JFK airport. Also, it is very close to Central Park, and about 20 minutes walk to Broadway theatre district. It is close to restaurants and cafes, and a shopping mall (where you can find the Whole Foods grocery shop). - Peculiar decor. The lobby and the rooms are decorated stylishly, that is, if you like this kind of modern decoration. The main complaint we had was that it was too dark everywhere: in the lobby, in the restaurants, and in the rooms. - Hardwood floor and nice wood paneling in our room, which I really liked. - Room is very small -- many other reviewers have already commented on this. - Bathroom is very small -- I don't particularly mind a small bathroom without a tub (shower only), but there does not seem to be enough room in front of the toilet, making it very cramped. (I am a small person, so I could still fit into the space, but I imagine it would be really difficult for a big or even an average person.) Also, not enough room around the sink to place the basic things (like cups and toothpaste). - No free Internet. One has to pay US$10 per day for wireless Internet access. No wired Internet. - The restaurant in the hotel is expensive, and the food is not good. Avoid the crab cakes. They are so salty I had to drink a lot of water to wash them down! (As I was hungry, otherwise I would not have touched them). I would say try restaurant outside the hotel. It is very close to the Hell's Kitchen district with lots of restaurants to fit every taste. - The AC in the room is very noisy, so we had to turn it off to go to sleep. - Lots of noise from the busy streets below (we were on the sixth floor). - Our room was very far away from the elevator. I never thought this could be a problem until we actually walked for probably 2 minutes (3 long corridors and two turns) to get from the elevator to our room.

The hallways are painted a dark grey, so the illusion of darkness is probably magnified by this. Hotel staff were pleasant and attentive. Rooms were clean, well appointed, and comfortable. The negatives have to do with the check in process. Official check in time is 3pm. We checked in at noon, and were told the room wasn't ready, however it would be within the hour. We decided to relax on the Secret Garden terrace while we waited. We made 3 separate inquiries during the next 4 hours about our room, being told each time that it wasn't ready yet. It was almost 5pm before we were given access to our room. The wait was made more annoying by the fact that we couldn't use the room charge, even though we were checked in, until we physically had our things in the room. Due to circumstances, my daughter and I were at the hotel without my wallet so being denied use of our room charge kept us from even enjoying a drink during the time.

My wife has pictures of me (fully clad and for descriptive purposes only) stretched out across the bed. Although quite tall, cross ways the room extended from my head to my shins; lengthways, from headboard my feet very nearly reached the shower. Weird feeling, sleeping in there with its woodpanelled walls and low ceiling with a glinting fire safety nozzle. Every night I felt like Sean Connery in the coffin at Slumber's Funeral Parlor in 'Diamonds are Forever'. The walls squeezing in ever closer - what if I'd offended a receptionist? She might turn on the ovens, and stand by with an urn for the garden of remembrance...! So rooms, and bathrooms, weren't so good. You can't do 'good' with those limitations, just reasonably clean and well air conditioned. The rest of the hotel, though, including the staff attitude and service, is fantastic and chic and modernist and inspiring. From the library to the bars, to the skyline views from the trendily underlit roof garden, the whole thing is just a joy to be in after one too many B&Bs or twee country house hotels. Admittedly, the half naked waitresses in the courtyard and rooftop bars were a strange touch to be sure - I really mean it, when we were there girls dressed in a kind of unbuttoned Morroccan jellaba were dishing out the Sam Adams and cosmos. It might sound like a nice one for the [single] lads, but in the midst of a properly swanky hotel it just came off as unnecessarily seedy. Of course, the best thing about this place is the location. You really can do a huge chunk of NY things from here on foot which is so fantastic, as New York is a very underrated walking city by tourists. You can practically throw a tennis ball into the Lincoln Center from the Hudson (which had film, dance and music summer festivals on whilst we were there, most of them free). Columbus Circle's at the other end of the street with all its life and transport links; and, of course, Central Park and the Met Museum really is only a 10/15 minute stroll away. On location alone, it's highly recommended. If, like me, you really need a trusted love one to saw off your legs before you go so that you can fit into the bedroom, then I say do it, just for the barking mad Hudson experience! Of course, the leg issues might negate the strong location plusses for walkers, but you get the idea.

Hairdryer in bathroom but yes strangely only soap, shampoo and bodymilk provided so bring your own shower gel and conditioner.

Lobby very dark could hardly see to sign the card you have to do. I was on the 17th floor which was nice the landing leading to the room was very dark & spooky.(Only noise was people slamming their doors.) My room has double bed very small room, hardly any room to put your clothes. I was on my own so can you imagine a couple. well for the bathrom it was very tiny & I'm 5' 1\" so if you were taller you would have job to sit on the toilet in comfort! for the bath it was tiny too. I laid down in it & had to put my feet on the wall. The room was very clean & as for the bed it was very comfy. Same no tea/coffee in the room as an English person we are use to it. The air con was great as 80's which is very hot of us Brits!!!!! Hudson was in a great location easy walking to places as the subway 2 mins walk to Columbus Circle. This right by Central Park. I would recommend you get a Metro card & put how much you want on it & you can top it up at anytime. Beware subway very spooky with lots of pillars around. Sign post not very good comparing to the tube in London. I would recommend \"On board tours \" (book from home) which I went on which give you a guide of New York. It was 5.5hrs but worth every $. You go on bus/walk/ferry from Time Square which you can walk from the hotel. I took a yellow cab as so jetlagged. I also went on Helicopter ride with same company it was AWESOME.. Its expensive but worth it. You have pics taken you can buy or not. It did.( You can take pics in the helicopter) I would recommend you going on \"Top of the Rock \"Rockfeller Centre as much better view than the Empire State Building.(You have your pics taken here too buy or not I did.) If you have children you must go the toy shop FAO Swartz its fab so much better than Hamleys in London. Time Square offers you cut price tickets to shows the queues were very long. I didn't get to see the show as only ther 4 nights. There is so much to see but will be back again. I would recommend the coffee shop on the corner called EUROPAN open 24 hrs & will deliver to your room.You come out of the hotel turn left its on the corner you can't miss! Enjoy..... I didn't eat in the hotel or go the bars as expensive.Shopping is very good to as tourist you get a discount at Bloomingdales & Macy's. but you need to go to the visitor place to get it & take some ID.

First morning I wanted to ask where the breakfast room was and two people behind the counter continued their conversation without acknowledging me, I waited until I finally had waited so long I tried to interrupt whereupon the lady held up a finger to me and said \"One minute ma'am\", very rudely. And one evening when I tried calling down to ask for a wake-up call the phone was literally never answered, three times. It's also a little too much of a scene for me, and I like a scene. Went to the bar with a book on Sunday evening, opened it to a cacophany of music and DJ noise, closed it gently and quietly crept away. That said the roof terrace is lovely so I went there instead and consumed an $18 glass of chardonnay.

We checked in and Sarah at the front desk said she was going to upgrade us to a bigger room to give us some more space. We set our things down in the room and explored the area. There is a CVS and a grocery store right down the street to pick up any essentials and an awesome 24 hour bakery 1 building down called Europan that we went to about 10 times in 4 days. When we came back, a hotel employee asked us for our room keys to make sure we were guests before we got on the elevator (which was an awesome thing). The hotel is a 2 minute walk from the Columbus Circle Subway station and about a 4 minute walk from Central Park. We could get to the southern most point of Manhattan in about 20 minutes! The room was exceptionally clean and we had room to put our suitcases in the large, walk in closet. The bathroom was a standard bathroom, nothing special except the design of the sink was cool! The bed was very low to the ground and the pillows a bit tiny but it was comfortable. The TV control didn't work great but it wasn't a big deal. Our room was always spotless when we got back. The only thing I would caution is that it is a very lively crowd at the bar. The music was going until late. It wasn't bad but we were on the 4th floor and had to get up early to go to the Statue of Liberty. I fell right asleep though. The Sky Terrace is beautiful and we wished we could have spent more time up there. We wanted to order a pitcher of Sangria but just ran out of time. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel.

I'll try to describe our opinion in a few words... The hotel is very interesting from an artistic point of view.It's very stylish, the furniture well studied and placed, peculiar lights ( which hardly show you your way, believe me!). The reception is beautiful and so is the concierge desk.The bar inside is also beautiful, with Kartell furniture, a glass floor and it is always crowded with people, mostly well in their thirties, well dressed and very early in the evening,when they just come back from work. The hotel is very popular among stylish and young people as a restaurant and for its terrace outside... We wanted to enoy the newyorker atmosphere so we did not mind the loud music in the afternoon till night.we had dinner at th erestaurant, which struck us for being so DARK... I just tell you that I had to ask for three candles ( one by one...at last I must have sounded quite annoyed for that), because I could barely see what I ordered! The food was good, but we just tasted it, never seen it and in addition to that wine bottles were extremely expensive ( almost everywhere in New York ) and the men\u00f9 choice was very poor...so I would not recommend the restaurant personally. Let's come back to our check in. We arrived quite late and tired, about 21.30..and surprise..we were left at the reception where we had a seat waiting for our room. This all took more than 40 minutes, how come? we booked our room and it was late in the evening, why shouldn't it be ready??? At the very first sight the room caught our eyes because it is very \"minimal\" and \"well designed\"...but we suddenly found out how small it was.Extremely small! The room is actually just a bit wider than the bed itself ( not a proper double bed), plus a mini closet ( filled with the safe and a hi-fi), a desk and the again extremely small bathroom. I must say everything was clean, but no space for our luggage at all!We had to put it over the bed during the day to walk around the room ( hitting continuosly the tv, the desk, and my husband ..). The bathroom was also trendy, I liked the shower which was separated by the bedroom from a transparent window with a stylish curtain. The position of the hotel is very good, well served by public means and surrounded by restaurants, fast food, internet caf\u00e8 and drugstores. The staff was quite ok, especially the guys/girls employed at the concierge desk. I don't know what my review might suggest you, but I would recommend thi shotel just for young couples and people, to people not looking for much relax ( it's loud ) and expecially to those who appreciate interior design. I don't think it's place for families or older couples at all!

We dragged our stuff up to the lobby/ bar area (which is huge and extremely dimly lit, as if your inside a club with music thumping everywhere you go) We stood in a long line (at midnight) and once we got to the desk, we find out the computers are down. We had to wait another half hour to get a room. Nothing was offered to compensate our waiting. Once we finally got a room, it turned out to be the tiniest room ever.

I am a former new yorker now on the west coast traveling back often. There is nothing special about this hotel. It appears to be trendy but is overrated. There are definitely better hotels in new york if your looking for a trendy hotel. The bar is overpriced and most of the clientele are uptight suits or Europeans. The location is near a subway station, but being on 9th avenue it is not so convenient if you plan on doing tourist things. You are on the outskirts of Hells Kitchen.

Before I booked this hotel, I read about other people's experiences on Tripadvisor (good and bad), but I was staying there alone so the idea of being in a small room didn't concern me, especially as I knew that I wasn't planning to spend a lot of time in the room. Also, I got what I considered to be a relatively good rate, so I figured I'd give it a try. The lobby is impressive, and the girl who processed my check-in was efficient and very friendly. When I got to my room on the 12th floor, I was pleasantly surprised. (By the way, yes, the corridors are dimly lit but they're not so dark that you can't see where you're going - unless you have glaucoma, possibly.) In my room, there was plenty of floor-space around the decent-sized bed, and room for a desk and chair. There was also enough space to store my suitcase. The room was clean, and the bedding and towels were of good quality. There was a dock for my i-pod, which was a nice addition. The air-conditioning worked well - it was rather loud, but I found that I didn't need to keep it on overnight, so it didn't affect my ability to get to sleep. So, yes, the room was small but it didn't feel claustrophobic. The bathroom was much bigger than I'd been expecting - there was a bathtub/shower, and it was twice the size of the bathroom I'd had when I stayed at the Algonquin earlier this year. Also, the bathing products were lovely, although a shower cap would have been a useful addition. The bars in the hotel are busy and loud, and the action goes on until late. I didn't fancy the very loud and funky bar, although I would have liked to have had a drink in the Library Bar, but it was too busy and there wasn't room on the night when I looked in. The only negative event I can report was when I went to have a drink in the open-air courtyard bar. It's a good space, and a nice place to sit and enjoy a drink if the weather's good (in theory...) It took me 10 minutes to attract the attention of a waiter. I asked him if I could have a Bombay Sapphire and tonic - he just shrugged his shoulders and said what sounded like, \"I don't know\" and then he said something unintelligible. (Perhaps he wasn't a waiter - just someone who was passing my table, dressed as a waiter...) Anyway, after about 15 minutes, no sign of any drink, although the faux-waiter was still wandering around, looking useless. So, I placed my order again with a waitress, and got the drink I'd asked for. A little later, I asked the waitress for the check. She went away... and didn't bother to bring me anything. After 15 minutes of waiting, I grabbed a passing waiter and told him I'd asked for the check - he said he'd sort it out. He came back and said, \"The waitress will bring your check over in a moment.\" A further 10 minutes passed and that waiter eventually brought me the check. So, frankly, to have to wait 25 minutes for someone to bring the check is just rubbish - especially when they're charging $15 for a gin tonic. So, that was frustrating and annoying, but other than that I didn't really have much to do with the staff, as I was only using the hotel as a place to sleep. Everyone else I dealt with, I have to say, was pleasant and efficient. Given that other people on this site have been outraged by the size of the bedrooms and bathrooms at the Hudson, I wonder if I just got very lucky, because I didn't have any problems with my room at all.

The person who showed us to the second room could not read the room numbers sign and sighed in frustration. The entire hotel is dark, even the reception. The room corridors are cave like.

The green escalators carted you away from the craziness of the urban scene into the dark tranquility of the Hudson. The lobby was well-appointed as was the Hudson \"cafeteria\". However, $30.00 per person for breakfast was too much. Tip--go to the restaurant on the corner and get 2 eggs and a sausage for $9.00 bucks. The concierage staff was the best. The guys were very helpful. Interestingly, none of the staff looked over the age of 30! This is a place for the young and the beautiful (or the bold and the beautiful) (and the foreign tourist from Europe and S. America). Seriously, if you're over 50 years of age, consider another location. Mom and Dad wouldn't fit in here. I saw one couple in their 50's on the Sky Terrace--they looked liked divorcees and looked they were trying to be cool with the young guns. (It wasn't working and they soon departed.). On Monday, around 7 PM Eastern I was greeted by the song \"Me, So Horny\" pounding in the lobby for the annual Monday night blowout party. Acccording to the DJ: \"Monday is the new Friday\" at the Hudson?!! The young and the beautiful crowded around the velvet rope. The hotel staff was very cool and very accomodating. Now--the rooms. I started out in a tiny , smoking room on the 6th floor (I had booked non-smoking), but got upgraded to the 11th floor larger non-smoking room at no extra charge. The lamp on the tiny desk was broken in the first room and the lamp cord had been spliced together with tape! Scary! The engineer said that \"more of these lamps were on order, but hadn't arrived yet.\"? The second room was MUCH better until the AC quit on the last day. It took 3 phone calls until Engineering finally showed up. The engineer stated that \"the fuse blew out down the hall\" and corrected the problem. You don't hang out in the rooms here. The clausterphobia will get to you within an hour. Basically, Ian Schraeger needs to bust down some walls and join some of the rooms into one to give more breathing space--but I'm sure that would cut into profits?. Note: The rooms are smaller even than the boutique hotels in Paris. The fitness center looked pretty nice. The Sky Terrace bar had a terrific view. The cocktails were good, but the bar tenders seemed a bit \"green\". I kept waiting for Kim Catrall and Sarah Jessica Parker to show up at any moment. Finally, the place is very, very dark. It's soothing, but really I couldn't see far in front of me in the hallways. More light would be helpful especially to those of us in their early 40's.

My only problem was when the hotel internet went down for almost 12 hours. Oh, and the main light went out in the entrance to my room that they replaced....three days later. And on my last day, the key machine broke which meant that everytime I had to go back to my room, I had to wait 10 minutes for a security guard (I checked out early and moved to another hotel). Nonetheless, I had a good experience there. My executive producer checked into a room...that had blood on the sheets. That didn't go over so well for him, or his wife. My director moved out after one day as her room was dirty upon arrival and had some kind of air conditioner/boiler that kept her up all night. \"Enough,\" she said (and she says she has never checked out of a hotel before where the rest of her team was staying at). Our other five guests didn't complain...only the most important ones to me! So if you are a group leader, you are BOUND to get complaints as there definitely are problems with the hotel...whether the size of the room, whether the service, etc. We had room upgrades for our room, or I would have expected more complaints as the botton tier rooms are so small that if you eat a Hostess Ho Ho, you'll fill the room and won't be able to move. As for service, it can be very hit or miss. One day we had a challenge with one of the folks at the front desk and any other hotel would have fired her for her rudeness (and we're actually very easy to please...but the hotel staff isn't trained in classic hotel management, or if they are, most of them have not read the manual as they're out at casting calls and auditions during the day). But in a Four Seasons \"yes sir, yes maam\" \"my pleasure\" kind of way...don't expect that. The reason to stay at the hotel...??. The entire lobby area, restaurant, outdoor patio area is fantastic. Very cool. Great bars and common areas. I will say that in the bar area where they have the restaurant, there is a bar with only ten seats, and often they have three bartenders behind the small bar....who....are so entertained by themselves that it takes a good amount of work to get their attention...and they're only eight feet away from you. They're nice, but....not attentive. But it's still fun to sit there and mingle. And the food in the restaurant is good, especially the comfort food. And if you don't mind the $27 buffet breakfast price, the breakfast buffet is nice. And if you do have a nice room, it will never be large and cavernous (wasn't it once a former YMCA?), but you might luck out. Don't count on it. Also, it's in a great location, only one block from Columbus Circle and Central Park, so you can't ask for better than that. That's one of it's best attributes. Move this hotel to anywhere else in the city and ... it would have closed already. And the price can be great....which is what led us back there. Would I go back again? Yes, but...it would be depending on price, but I wouldn't bring a group back as it's not worth it if they're unhappy and complaining. As you can see from Trip Advisor, the hotel essentially doesn't even bother responding to guests complaints. The hotel can be fantastic for some, and a disaster for others and that's simply the way it is at the Hudson. If you go in expecting a toss of the coin, you won't be surprised. Hopefully you'll get lucky!

Third, I did not hear any music from the lobby in the hallways or in my room. In contrast, my room was super quiet. Another thing I really liked about the Hudson is the location.

The staff was at times very helpful; at others, not so much (like when I was trying to change a $100, and the lone front desk clerk didn't have access to the cash drawer!). The bars are quirky and fun, though sometimes off-limits due to private parties; but if you do get in, there may not be anywhere to sit. Everything but the room was expensive - the breakfast buffet costs twice what it rightfully should have. The room was about 1/3 the cost of a typical midtown room (via Hotwire) - but 1/4 the size. Internet access just didn't work. The heat was unnecessarily on at full blast in the hallways, which meant I had to have the A/C on in the room. Unfortunately, the HVAC unit is smack up against the head of the bed, and it's a compressor-based system; when it kicked on periodically during the night, it would jar me awake. The hotel cries out for a bit of management to better channel the efforts of the well-intentioned staff. As it stands, I would recommend it only for young people substantially more interested in a good time at a low cost than sleep or comfort.

Considering that a hotel should be a home from home whether you are on holiday or business I thought this was pretty poor service. Thankfully we were eventually let in but we then had to come out to speak to the bouncers so that a friend who was meeting us was allowed in. Madness - what is the point of having a bar in a hotel if you are not allowed to use it? (For any SATC fans I think its the same bar where Samantha ditches Smith and disappears upstairs with Richard.....)

I have stayed in other hotels in NY and you don't get much square footage for your money - but these rooms are ridiculous. If you just need somewhere where you can collapse on to the bed as soon as you open the door this is the hotel for you! The bathrooms are really small - unless you are a size zero you are going to struggle to turn around and just so that you know - if you are staying in the same room as a friend or anyone other than a partner - they will be able to see you having a shower thanks to the glass walled bathroom.... ok if you don't mind showing your bits off but not for the shrinking violets among us! The gym is tiny as well in keeping with the theme of the hotel rooms - I wouldn't bother - just take your trainers and go for a run in the park instead. Breakfast is good - served in a darkened room so if you have been up all night enjoying the bar no one should notice!

I'd been to the hotel for drinks before, and knew that it was a bit of a scene, but as a hotel, it definitely did not disappoint. When we arrived, the staff was extremely pleasant, and we were actually upgraded. So the room, while not huge, was much larger than the one we'd booked. The room was hip and modern in terms of design, but some might find the heating to be noisy. Having lived in NY, I am familiar with noisy water heat in old buildings, but if you are not, you will likely find it to be noisy. Again, for $149, this hotel was a steal; at $350 a night, we may have found it to be too much. When you return at night, the lobby will have turned into a loud nightclub, due to the two popular lobby bars. You either like that or you don't, but our room was on a high floor and there was no problem with noise from the lobby at all. We had drinks at the Library Bar, which were expensive, but no more so than other hotels in NYC. Also, it would be great if they offered free wireless; it is $10 per night. But, in terms of location, it is right off of Columbus Circle and Central Park. While I never lived in that neighborhood, it is a very pleasant, central place to stay for a long weekend.

Booked this hotel using Priceline's \"name your price\" and got the room for $110 (+fees) per night which we were happy with... that was until we started reading reviews panning this place into oblivion. We expected the worst and we pleasantly surprised to find it not to be that bad at all. Yes it is dark inside but so what... if you wear sunglasses inside, you're an idiot, if you don't wear sunglasses inside, you're fine! Yes it is pricey to grab a drink in the bar or eat... so eat out, it's not like there's not much choice. Yes the staff are young (and restless?) but we found everyone to be really friendly and helpful from the doormen to the concierge to the checkin staff to the checkout staff... even the maid's seemed really friendly always saying \"Hi\" as you passed them, although we didn't really stop to chat. Yes the rooms are tiny but unless you're grossly overweight or plan on spending all your time in New York pining away in your room (in which case there really is no help for you!)... the rooms are perfectly fine. Yes the beds are low... erm... I'm not sure what the problem is... if you can't get out of a bed that is a little lower to the ground than the average bed, you probably shouldn't be travelling unaccompanied! The Good The exceptionally small rooms are surprisingly well laid out and had lots of nice little touches that either made them seem larger or added to the overall usability of the room. E.g. ipod dock with speakers, mirrored walls (nudge, nudge, wink, wink), LCD TV built into the mirrored wall, window to the bathroom from the bedroom (allows for lots of light to get in and makes both rooms feel airier (is that a word?). The rooms are very clean The room has controllable and responsive heating system Nice little nook for a closet, big enough to fit a medium suitcase, opened on the fold out standThe hotel is modern and pretty classy Bathroom is stocked with fancy shampoos and soaps (not that I used any of it) Location is great, a 15 minute walk from Times Square, a 3 minute walk from Central Park The Bad No getting away from it the rooms are small but they are still functional and comfortable for a short visit The windows are not really sound proof... we were on the 14th Floor and by 6:30am the hustle and bustle outside were clearly audible (but then again, if I was asleep I probably wouldn't have noticed... I'm an early riser) The HVAC is noisy, every time it kicks in it seems like every component inside the unit behind the headboard jumps 2 inches to the right and flaps open randomly (RECOMMEND - turn the heating down so it doesn't come on as often) The mini bar was extortionately priced... $4.50 for a small bottle of water... luckily there are plenty of shops close by so stock up on food and drink from the outside if you think you might be tempted to eat/drink in the room High Speed wireless internet available for $10 a day... why do hotels insist on charging for this still? It should be a freebie. Although pleasant, the concierge was misinformed on a couple of things... e.g. we wanted to purchase a New York Pass (gets you access to tons of attractions including all the main ones) for a low price (we paid $99 for 2 days and definitely got our money's worth), however, we asked the concierge if we could buy one at the Circle Line Cruise place (Pier 83) and we were told no and that the best place to get them was in Times Square... consequently we didn't have time to get to Times Square, grab tickets and get to Pier 83 for a 10am cruise... turns out that a) the place in Times Square was not a main office and only had 1 ticket left for sale b) we walked past a main office (Gray Line office 47th and 8th) on the way to Times Square only to have to walk back c) we could have bought the tickets from Pier 83 and thus made the 10am cruise after all!!! The Ugly No show stoppers... all the bad stuff (above) are minor inconveniences but nothing that would make me not want to stay here... that said, if you're married to a big fat lass or a big fat lad, the mirrored walls and window from the main room into the shower could be a little off putting... luckily the window has a curtain on both sides so you can close them to protect your eyes and as for the mirrored walls, you can either close your eyes or turn the light off... or just be happy with the person your with and enjoy the ride (if you excuse the pun!)

A flickering two-foot high gas torch marks the entrance. Its flames crack the surrounding concrete of the Soviet-style mausoleum fa\u00e7ade. Walk sideways in front of the glass to enter - it confuses everyone - and ascend the shoulder-wide three-story escalator to a green-lit low beam lobby entrance. The lobby is practically unlighted and paneled in faux dark wood. The pleasant tee-shirted staff have an attitude of corporate-enforced peppiness. They know you'll be calling about the 15,000 decibels of pulsating bass that makes its way up through the ventilation to your room several floors above. Lurch into the small crowded elevator and hope you can find the right button before you pass your floor. If you manage to see the button in dark, it may be partly covered by the textured wood paneling. As you creep down the narrow charcoal-painted hallways, your back crimps with anticipation at what lies beyond the door to your room. Your animal instincts serve you well. It is not a room - it is a paneled cell, sheathed in more of the same dark fake wood paneling. Do not drop any small valuables. You will not find them again in the dark corners. As everywhere else in the Hudson, the ornamental lighting actually impairs vision. Mr. Starck, a maker of bath faucets and blow molded plastic goods, has managed to backtrack on ninety years of progress in lighting design since Poul Henningsen developed efficient, soft illumination; Starck's weird ornamental fixtures manage to provide glare without illumination. And watch out in the bathroom! because the toilet is only 16 inches from the wall. If you don't bang your shins on your way into the kinky glass shower (please don't ask), you'll smack your head into the tiles when you sit on the pot. Owww. Better slide to the bottom of the bed than getting out on the right side because the wall-mounted TV is waiting to separate your shoulder. Now for that 1:30 AM call to the front desk to get them to turn down the Pink Floyd in concert in the bar. The operator says \"no problem\", the hotel manager will speak to the bar manager. Nodding off 25 minutes later in spite of the noise, the hotel security desk calls to inquire about my complaint. Another five minutes later, the front desk calls back to inquire whether the noise level is better. Now it's two in the morning. Is this punishment for the noise complaint? Thanks for the calls. When I speak to the desk manager in person the following day, I am told, between enthusiastic handshakes, that there is no substitute room available for me and that the hotel had vacated the fourth floor as a buffer floor but he would speak to the bar manager\u2026 What kind of Hotel keeps its guests awake with loud night club music?! The poor staff - probably artists, writers, grad students, actors - ask timidly \"have you enjoyed your stay\" and start to apologize before the answer comes. The rooms are not merely small.

Having a greeter was a nice touch, though she didn't do much but say hello and welcome. Front desk staff was really pleasant and helpful. My room was about the size of a decent walk-in closet. I could barely move around the bed, the workspace just held my laptop. And the dark paneling made it feel even smaller. The bathroom was proportionately small. I could barely move around in it. The water never really got hot, the sink never really shut off. The only nice feature was a big window between the shower and the room so I could watch ESPN while getting clean. The dining space is intersting - same brick as the lobby with long community tables. The food was so-so, and definitely not worth the $30 I paid for the buffet. I was impressed with their gym, which had 3 treadmills and other cardio equipment each with their own TV, and plenty of weight equipment. And it was a big space so it never felt crowded.

I came away knowing I'd give them a great review on TripAdvisor because I think the place gets a bum rap here. After reading reviews here I was concerned, but the reviews actually helped me a lot as far as setting expectations goes. Front desk staff were exceedingly friendly and happily checked me in several hours early since my room was ready (yay). No attitude about me having booked through Priceline at all, which was something others have mentioned. I found the lobby and all the public areas VERY groovy and interesting! I did not find the hallways to be shabby or not well-maintained at all, they were just fine. Dark, of course, but not dirty or any of the other stuff folks have mentioned. And yes, the room was extremely small - I believe it was approx 18 feet from the door to the wall behind the bed, slightly less wide - there is maybe a foot of wiggle room on either side of the bed. More than 1 person in the smallest room would be nearly unbearable in my opinion. Somehow I lucked out and had an actual wall between the center of the room and the shower. I didn't find that the shower curtain stuck to me while showering (lol). Nice Korres toiletries too. The bathroom was just the slightest bit...icky, the ceiling and showerhead looked like they could use a little work but for $100 a night I could hardly complain! The bed was super comfy, but was indeed low to the floor. Not an issue for me. Even though I was on the 19th floor I could hear street noise so definitely bring earplugs to ensure a good night's rest. This is par for the course in New York so it really did not bother me. The heating pipes clicked and clacked a little when the heater fired up but again, nothing I couldn't handle and it died down quickly. I did not go to any of the bars/restaurants at the Hudson because the prices are just outrageous. Hang a left out the front door and have breakfast at The Flame Diner on 9th Ave - it's a classic NY diner that ain't fancy, but the food's good and breakfast was less than $10 every day for me! The Belgian waffles are amazing, try one. :-) The coffee is great too. If you're a Starbucks fan, hang a right out the hotel door and it's just steps away. There's also a giant shopping mall inside the CNN building just down the block, on Columbus Circle. All manner of chain stores plus a small Dean & Deluca foods-to-go area and even a Whole Foods in the basement! Subway of course is available at 59th St/Columbus Circle and you're just steps away from Central Park South. Clientele was mostly young Euros using the hotel as a base. They all seemed happy enough to be in such a groovy place. I did see a few bewildered older folks, as in elderly (lol) and a couple of business travelers but overall the crowd skewed young. No probs at checkout, no phantom charges, and they gave me a keypass to use the PC in the business center to print out my boarding pass - just ask nicely and I'm sure you can do the same. All in all, I would stay here again in a heartbeat for $100/night. If I paid $358/night (the going rate) or even $200 a night for the Hudson I'd probably have wanted to die or (kill someone) when I saw the room size and I'd probably pick severely at every aspect of the hotel. If you normally stay in 4-star digs then stay away because you will be disappointed/upset.

I was there is December right before xmas for a little holiday fun. We had two of our three kids with us- two boys one is 13 and the other is a college student at university. I travel on business to NY so I am familiar with the city etc but this was strictly pleasure. Location is a huge plus: The hotel is extremely centrally located which was wonderful for exploring midtown/theater district /5th AVe etc as well as next to the Columbus Circle subway entrace (by which you can go anywhere you want for $2 on the subway. Staff: Staff was extremely courteous, Amy at the front desk went to school at UCSB and we chatted about that. She upgraded our room for a very reasonable fee ( will get to that in a minute). Michael at the door was equally personable. The hotel staff definitely is composed of young hipsters but from check in, to bag storage, to the restaurant/bar, I did not uncover one attitude or any rudeness whatsoever. One front desk clerk was more than happy to hunt down a matchbook for my son who was starting a collection. Room Size: Yes it is very small for a standard room but well configured and well lit. You should note that the standard room comes only with a queen bed. So, if you are two friends planning on sharing a room, or two growing boys etc, this is obviously not ideal. Which brings me to my next point. They upgraded one of our rooms upon request and for $90 to a double deluxe which was very comfortable , I would say even large by NYC standards. My sons stayed in that room with two double beds. We got the room on price line for $150 so even with the upgrade, it was quite reasonable. I would not be happy at all to pay upward of $400 for the standard room. For me, that would not have worked. Otherwise rooms fine, clean, bed comfortable etc. We didnt spend alot of time in our room. If you are there on business, the standard may be too small to actually work and if you are planning on meeting someone there, dont do it in a standard room. NO room whatsoever, the surroundings are intimate. Words of caution/things to note: Hotel lobby is extremely dark, I kid you not about this one. Your eyes literally adjust when you get up the escalator. They are going for some type of atmosphere/ feeling concept etc. So be prepared and if you are not a \"young 50\" or younger, you may want to rethink this unless you are in the art/design/fashion business, then you will probably get the whole thing, We liked it. I am 42, my husband is 54. Not a problem for us. Our kids were thrilled with the swanky atmosphere. The techno music they play one of the nights in the bar is annoying but that is minor and comes from an outside group that uses the space. Restaurant/Bar- Very pricey. My son had dinner with a friend there and said the food was fine in the \"cafeteria\" but he thought overpriced, hey this is NY. I went to the library. Again, I loved the space /concept, may not be for everyone. I found it to be warm and inviting but $20 for a glass of wine seemed outrageious, even by NY standards. And they would not let my son in who is 13 which seemed kind of odd given it is not a bar but more a public spot that one can get a drink as well. The area on top was closed and I was disappointed not to see that as I am sure it would be worth a trip up there during the spring/summer. One other note, the heating was up way too high in the hallways near the rooms. It felt like you were in a furnace room but we didnt mention that because we didnt stay in the hotel that long much less in the hallways for any period of time.

The prices of the food, drink and everything else as per previous reviews is way too expensive, which is a pity, but it makes you go outside a lot, an example we bought 2 drinks, 1 cocktail + 1 bottle of beer, total inc tip $27 in the Hudson Bar, and in a very high end Rest, Olive Garden, a big glass of lovely wine was $7 per glass and beers around the same, and the Olive Garden is in the middle of Times Square.

The only other problem was the noise of the plumping... every time someone in the room next to you used either the shower or toilet, the pipes made some really weird and loud noises. I think also the senser on the TV is so sensitive that if someone else changes their channel, yours will change also.. ours switched by itself a few times.

Because I had read many online reviews, I was prepared for a VERY SMALL room. The room size met expectations. We bid 170 dollars for the room and with taxes & fees, we paid about 200 a night. Priceline rates this place with 3 and a half stars; shame on Priceline...I expected more with this rating. Upon check-in, we requested a non-smoking room on an upper level. The staff accommodated. We had been warned through reviews that if you are on a lower floor it can be noisy because of the bar below. When we called ahead of time with these requests, we were told that we had to call Priceline...saying that usually you call the hotel directly, but in the case of the Hudson, you call Priceline. Priceline was required to tell us that such requests (a non-smoking room & upper level floor might mean additional charges!!) They did not. When we requested an upgrade to a king size bed at check-in, we were told it would cost an extra 60 dollars a night; we declined. We thought our bed would be a double, but thankfully it was a queen; no extra charge! The bed in this very small room was very low to the floor, presenting a challenge getting out of it. The room safe was level with the floor, requiring that you get down flat on the floor to use it. It was a challenge opening luggage, but I managed to put a couple of decoartive barrels together to serve as a luggage stand. There was a rack for the other bag. Please do not stay here if you expect to sleep at night...the steam pipes creaked and crackled every time the heat came on. I asked if the engineer could check this and was told that the building was SO OLD that it was impossible to stop the noise. The technicians checked it anyway and nothing changed. I solved the problem somewhat, by running the fan continuously so I would not be awakened every time the heat came on. It was very cold in NYC during our stay so the heat came on regularly.

I was charged for an item from the mini bar which I did not take; I called later when I discovered the charge and the billing office removed it with no argument. It had not appeared on the bill under the door at the morning of chek-out. We had a deposit of 35 dollars per umbrella (we used two) placed on our bill in case we did not return them. We did!

I expect the small size of the rooms should cause the rating to be reduced as my interpretation of a three star rating is for a room much larger than I received. The \"mismatch\" description refers to the small size of the room but with amenities you might expect from a four star property: paneled walls, way above average (funky) lighting fixtures, bath fixtures way above average for the sink but a single electrical outlet on the wall opposite the sink (if you have a short cord on a razor, hair dryer, etc, make sure you bring an extension cord). What I resent most of all were the packaged \"gifts\" which, once opened were charged to your room. The small warning that the \"gifts\" were for sale was easily overlooked. A package of two CD's is one example which I opened before seeing the warning. The price was $30. I complained to the front desk and the charge was removed.

We went up to the suit to find a slightly larger room with a slightly larger bathroom, this room was no more than an average sized room and with the extra cost was a very expensive average room. The bags had also not been moved from our other room and after requesting this happen a further 2 times i got the bags myself with my old keycard i had fortunately kept hold of.

I had a quick read through Tripadvisor before setting off, and this is probably the most accurately commented hotel of any of those I've stayed in. The location of the hotel is excellent, more or less on Central Park, and only 100m from the Columbus Circle subway, which is on the vital red line. You're never far from anything when staying here. And the unusual style of the hotel is quite nice too. The lobby is very impressive, and the low-lighting throughout does add a certain ambience that you don't normally get in hotels. It does feel like you're in a member's club rather than a hotel. Heating was at full tilt, and seeing as we were in minus temperatures outside, it was always nice to step inside. Check in was very straightforward. The rooms are tiny. If anything over the bare minimum required by a traveller is provided, we're talking about in inches rather than feet. Don't let this put you off though - apart from the lack of a bath, there isn't anything you can't do in one of these rooms that you might do in a suite. So all in all, that's quite good so far, and given the price for the time of year, I really wouldn't complain. Instead, I'd recommend. People staying in the hotel over the week seemed almost all to fall in the economy to mid-range traveller brackets. And I'd imagine that most of these folks took one look at the price list and never spent a single cent on the premises. I risked a bottle of beer one evening and got stung for $9. Which, like everything in the hotel, just isn't worth it. And due to the way the hotel is arranged, it is possible to enter and exit your room without crossing the lobby or encountering a member of staff. So with residents not spending any money, and residents not meeting or even visiting the communal areas, there is no hotel experience here for most guests. It's just a well-positioned, small room in New York. Why a hotel would take this strategy is beyond me. There is a potential four-figure audience for facilities staying each night, but they're all down the road in Starbucks, or another eatery. The premium they're earning on each item is surely dwarfed by the earnings they're losing by outpricing their core audience.", "Date": "January 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anaheim, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Room Small, but hey its NEW YORK!\u201d", "Author": "Call_Me_Mo", "ReviewID": "UR23144521", "Content": "When I found out I was staying at this hotel, I knew what I was getting into based on the review here. I was happy that I took a taxi. I'm sure I would still be looking for it, since the hotel has no marquee or sign of any kind. You just have to \"know\" its there. PRO and CON of the hotel..... Pro: * Great Location... close to the Columbus subway station, a Starbucks, Central Park (and Tavern on the Green!), to the Lincoln Center and a great Whole Foods market!! (The soup at Whole Food sure hit the spot on a cold day, and the price is downright cheap!) * The subway has the route which took us directly to JFK/ AirTrain. * Clean Room, Large bath, Central AC, great Shampoo and soap! (but see the con) * Nice staff. I requested a quiet room, and got what I wanted. The conceirge printed my Delta boarding pass for me... free of charge. Very courteous, dispite the chaos around them. Con: * The interior of the hotel is very dark. Perfect for vampires, but if you want bright and cheery, this is not for you! * Small room: I was in room 1601 which was very basic, and I was glad I packed light. The room had a \"closet\" with 8 hangers, a double bed, and a fair size bathroom. I think the bathroom was the same size as my sleeping quarter. NO drawers, so I ended up living out of my suitcase. * Thin walls. My neighbor dropped a coin or something metal on his floor and I could have sworn he was in my room! * Not the best lighting in the room. Like the lobby, the light is geared for vampires. If you turn on all the light in the room, it'll get real hot. Lucky you have central AC * Expensive if you eat there... but hey, you're in NYC and there's so much to do outside the hotel. (We found a great Italian place called Manga e Bevi on Ninth Avenue and 53rd Street. Reasonable and FUN!) * Hard to find if you don't know what to look for. Overall I give it 4 out of 5 stars. I'd stay there again if it were just me and my spouse. New York has so much to see and do, why bother staying in side the hotel?? The price on hotwire was decent and I stayed there during Christmas.

First the good things. Lobby, restaurants, and bar are very hip and fun. View from the rooftop is awesome. Location is super. No coffee pot in the room, but Time Warner Center is right across the street and Starbucks is a block away. Very close to Central Park and Lincoln Center. Also, the bed was like a big fluffy futon (on a wooden platform) but really comfortable. I heard a lot of European accents on elevator, so this must be a favorite for international travelers. Now the not so good. Staff is so caught up in being hip they forget they're supposed to take care of guests. (However, the bellmen are super -- they offered to lock up my computer in their safe while I was in meetings.) The regular rooms are smaller than the inside cabin of a cruise ship. If you sit on the toilet in the bathroom, you bump your knees against the opposite wall. Really, it's that small. If you're alone, it's not so bad. Last time I was there with my spouse for 3 days and it got very tight. There's no place to put a 2nd suitcase, so we had to put it on the floor beside the bed and step on it to walk around. Hallways are painted charcoal gray and you feel like you're moving through a cave. A little creepy. I also had so much cold air and noise from the window I checked to see if it was open. Bring earplugs if you want to sleep. This is not an easy hotel for a business traveller. The business center was OK (4-5 computer stations, 2 printers, unattended). I went there at 8:30 PM to print out my presentation for the next morning and the b/w printer was out of toner. I didn't get this message until I had swiped my credit card and paid for 15 minutes of computer time. The concierge said \"Well I don't know how soon I can get someone up there\" (sounded like she was yawning). I told her I would come to her desk and use her printer. She didn't refuse, and she requested a refund for my card. After all that, my card was charged double the quoted rate and I had to make multiple calls to get it credited. I think they're much more concerned with running the swanky bar than with keeping their business travellers comfortable. They make a lot more money from the bar.

But come on; it's New York. Unless you're willing to pay a fortune, rooms are going to be tiny. My girlfriend and I stayed here for five nights in mid November and paid about $300 per night (including taxes) and actually, the size of the room was never a problem. And on the plus side for the room, it was quiet once you got in, the bed was really comfy, the heating was good for those cold New York nights, and when you wanted a bit of fresh air you could throw the window open and suck in that 58th Street air. Elsewhere, the hotel was great. The library bar was very cool, and worth a visit for a cocktail (although the prices will probably mean that's a treat rather than a regular occurrence), and the chandelier over the check-in desk with holographic light bulbs is worth a closer look. But the best thing about this place is its location. Right there on Columbus Circle with its three (or four - I forget) subway lines running through.

Fabulously tendy yes, but not really that much else to recommend it. We paid around \u00a3150/night for a Deluxe (bigger than standard) through Expedia, but upgraded to a double double room for an additional $60 as there were no twin bedded rooms available. This room was a pretty good size, with 2 queen sized beds, and seems to be a world apart from standard rooms. There's just about enough hanging space (open rail by the door) but not enough hangers, no drawers, and a space to put suitcase & shopping. Lovely crisp cotton bedding with feather pillows & duvet, but I requested a change as I am allergic & it didn't actually happen until the 2nd day. Obviously very stylish decor and a decent flat screen TV (again, better than in a standard room). The bathroom was an OK size too (another benefit of the larger room) and didn't have the glass partition but instead a real solid wall and door. Top tip - the hairdryer is hung on the back of the bathroom door! Lots of trendy and luxurious accessories, but beware of the cost - the scented candles are not complimentary! No minibar but some extortionately-priced snacks and soft drinks. Although stylish, the rooms are really only the standard of an average Travelodge and are starting to need refurbishment. As others have commented, public areas are incredibly dark and actually quite depressing, especially the corridors. Rooftop terrace and outside bar are both quite lovely, and the former has the advantage of being for residents only. Elsewhere, in the garden bar and main bar, there is absolutely no preferential treatment for hotel residents - willingness to commit to bottle service appears to be the only way of securing a table, and at $300 for a bottle of vodka! This is probably the element that made me quite dislike the Hudson. At the weekend the bar is packed, with a velevet rope entry policy. In the garden bar, there was no chance of a table and we had to queue up for $18 drinks. On a quiet Monday, we were 'allowed' a table in the bar but only a small one and could not have a decent table for our party of 5 (even though the place was empty) because we did not want to purchase a bottle of spirits or champagne.

While I was staying there, all of the cab drivers knew where to go when we told them to take us to the Hudson Hotel (I think there was only 1 who didn't in the 4 days I was there). When we walked in, the decor was very surreal, from the glowing escalators to the chandeliers to the garden. The check-in staff and the concierge were very, very friendly and helpful. Then we headed over to the elevator. The wait for an elevator (at any point in the day) was quite long. Sometimes, we'd take a down elevator to the basement when we wanted to go up, just so we wouldn't miss it. Also, the elevators didn't appear to be air conditioned, and they got really hot. When we got to the hallway, it was strangely dark, but incredibly modern. Upon arriving at our room, it was.....small. It was actually the smallest hotel room I'd ever seen. It was smaller than my childhood bedroom (and that was small). If you can picture a double bed with about 12 - 18 inches around it, that is the size of a the main room. There is also a tiny bathroom, and that pretty much sums up the room. As I said, amazingly small. The decor was very \"cool\" however, and my comment on the room is that it were 3 - 4 times bigger, it would have been an incredible room because of the d\u00e9cor (and comparable in size to the average NYC hotel room). The bed was also very comfortable. However, we were in NYC, so we didn't want to spend much time in the room, which was the one saving grace. Another interesting fact about the hotel is that it doubles as a night club. We went out on Saturday night (to a nightclub) and when we returned (at about 4am) there was a line-up outside our hotel (quite a long line for 4am) for the nightclub at the hotel. However, I just flashed my key to the doorman and he let me right through. The only other insight I had on the hotel was the cost of the drinks. Very pricey. We went to the hotel bar (outside patio area) for a drink before our night on the town. There were 4 of us and I ordered 4 drinks and it was $64. Nothing fancy either, a Jack and Coke, a Gin and Tonic and 2 vodka martinis. Drinks in NYC tend to be expensive, but not that expensive. Those were the 4 most expensive drinks I bought on my 4 day trip. On the whole, it was a very cool concept hotel, but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. The rooms were small, but original. The decor was awesome. The atmosphere was very cool. Just realize that its not a hotel for everyone, but if you like modern and chic, this could be the hotel for you.", "Date": "July 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, TN", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Nashville_Nick", "ReviewID": "UR18279149", "Content": "I had an outstanding stay at the Hudson Hotel.

I'd rather stay in a small, fabulous room, than a huge, floral bedspread-clad one. Just a personal preference. The Hudson is in a great location, right by Time Warner Center and Columbus Circle. But that obviously doesn't matter too much, since you're in NYC and you can take a cab or the subway somewhere else if you'd like. If you feel cramped in the small rooms but you want to hang out at the hotel, just grab a chair in the lobby and relax there. Great music to listen to, which is also a plus for me.

That being said, what the hotel room itself lacked in expansiveness, it more than made up for with its features. Upon arrival at the hotel you feel like something out of mid-80\u2019s video but not in a cheesy way as the trek up the neon green escalator to the lobby area made for a more exciting ride. The lobby was lots of fun from the funky furniture to the high ceilings covered with ivy. Our room wasn\u2019t ready when we checked in, but we were guided where to go to store our luggage until we returned back to the hotel. A man by the name of Josh took our belongings and lickity split, we were off. Upon our return back to the hotel, my boyfriend got our room key and I the luggage and we ventured off to the 12th floor to see what we were in store for. I really enjoyed the hotel room, it was crisp, it was very clean and spacious enough for 2 people to get by and get around just fine. Granted, yes, the bathroom was very small and we have some difficulties maneuvering around one another when both of us were in there at the same time, but he shaved while I blew my hair out in the hall just outside and we adjusted just fine. But, the bathroom had a feature that I really enjoyed. Don\u2019t be frightened away by the description of the see-through glass shower door. It was a great feature, one person in the shower, one person on the bed watching you shower, just make sure to move the desk chair and you get a great view to a voyeuristic show. That being said, maybe some people aren\u2019t into that, or maybe knowing that you\u2019d be more intrigued to book your stay here (that and the hotel offered a \u201clove\u201d kit\u2026.we didn\u2019t indulge, but it\u2019s there in case you need it). The bed was comfy, although I wasn\u2019t quite sure about the pillows, I may have just gotten a bad batch. I tried to switch them up when my boyfriend wasn\u2019t paying attention, but started getting confused and couldn\u2019t remember whose were whose. I enjoyed the 2 big mirrors on the wall, and don\u2019t be scared, they\u2019re not floor to ceiling \u201cno-tell motel\u201d type mirrors, but it was nice to see double of yourself while finishing up to get done and head out. And okay, so the TV was small and the alarm clock wasn\u2019t iPod compatible, but just call to the front desk for a wake up call and you don\u2019t really have to worry about it. The a/c worked really well, maybe the others that stayed here didn\u2019t get quite so lucky, but we were cool in the midst of 95 degree NYC heat. And if you leave the curtain pulled closed, it keeps all of the cool air in the bed area; we kept it pulled shut all night too and actually woke up freezing in the morning. We hit the Hudson Bar in the hotel on a Saturday night shortly after one, and it was packed, but I think both of us lost steam during our 3 hour dinner at Le Bernardin to rally through and hang out and soak up the scene, but it was definitely a scene. We really enjoyed the relaxed outdoor bar just outside the lobby. Just beware that they close early, 11:30 p.m., as there are actual residents that live in the hotel who complain about the noise. So we just carried it inside to the library bar, sat ourselves on a nice plush leather couch and closed out that bar too (closes at 1:00 a.m.). The few complaints we had were minor, if anything to write about. Just know that you can\u2019t bring outside drinks to the rooftop lounge on the 15th floor, which I learned while sipping a frappuccino, which I thought was a little absurd. And although I didn\u2019t have much interaction with the hotel staff, my boyfriend just described some of them as harsh (and we\u2019re both former New Yorkers, so that attitude has to be worth something) The hotel itself was convenient to some great attractions, Central Park, the museums, etc. The subway was just around the corner and it was easy to grab a cab. We\u2019ve now stayed at two Ian Schrager hotels, both have had special meanings to us, but this was the most fun, at least in my book.

I was not disappointed and neither was my 65 y/o mother. I knew what the exterior looked like b/c I checked out its website; that way I knew what to look for when we arrived. We couldn't believe our eyes when we got off the escalator and entered the lobby. Ultra chic is the term that comes to mind. Not stuffy either. The front desk attendant that helped us, Chris, was very helpful and friendly. He asked if this was our first visit and when I confirmed that he said he would upgrade us to a complimentary larger room. We were so excited when we stepped into our room with dark wood floors and lovely dark wood walls. I have stayed in NYC hotels with smaller rooms so I was happy with the space in this room, though it was not spacious by any means. The showerhead was great and the water temp got very hot (a big plus for me!) My only complaint may be minor to some. The bathroom floor and shower were white tiles. I saw more mildew in the grout than I cared to see in such a lovely hotel but it wasn't the end of the world for me. I can not comment on the bar or the restaurant as I did not take advantage of them. My mother did get coffee each morning in the bar and was flabbergasted by the $5 pricetag.

I immediately called the front office to speak to the manager. After I was tranferred three times, I finally spoke to him. I told him my situation and he asked me if I wanted to be moved. Of course, why would I be calling? He didnt' tell me what room but send up a bellhop to move our bags and us to another room. The new room was just as small but no odor. As you can read from the other reviews, the rooms are small. We have stayed in bigger hotel rooms in the city for about the same or cheaper. We were just thankful it was the just two of us. There is not much room to move or stretch in this room. For the chick modern look of this hotel, we thought they could invest more in the tv. We were at least hoping for a flatscreen hanging from the ceiling. The tv was about 12 inches. We had a bigger tv on the cruise ship we just got off from. The hallways and elevators were not well air conditioned. It got hot at times in the summer heat. In front of the elevators on very floor, there are ice, snack and soda machines.

Close enough to see the sights but far enough to avoid the tourist traps and noise. Once you figure out the correct exit to take out of the subway terminal (Columbus Circle/59th), it\u2019s about a 4-block walk to the hotel. Neighborhood was quiet and safe. There are several diners, pharmacies, grocers and food stands in the area. It\u2019s about an 8-block walk to FAO Schwartz and 10 blocks to Central Park. Hotel- There is absolutely NO marking outside the hotel to indicate the location. Had I not studied the pictures before hand, I would have passed it up more than once. The entrance is very odd. It\u2019s a yellow building with a single door that looks like it\u2019s the backdoor of a shipping warehouse. Once you enter, you go through a double-sided glass door and up an escalator to the lobby. The hotel is poorly lit and the dark wood makes it hard to see. It definitely has a nightclub feel. (Which I believe is the idea) There is an outside patio to enjoy drinks at and a bar/library where you can shoot pool. A cafeteria is on sight but it is $24 per person for an all-you-can-eat buffet. Internet access is $10 per day. Rooms- The rooms were very modern and very small. (Even for NY standards) They were impeccably clean. The bed was comfortable and only stood two feet off the ground. You have probably 2 feet of space on either side of the bed before the mirrored walls block you. There is probably only 4 feet of space at the foot of the bed. Whoever mentioned that it was the size of a cruise ship cabin was dead on. The TV is only 13\u201d and hidden in a cabinet along with a CD player. There is a small desk that serves no purpose other than to have a space for personal belongings. The bathrooms are horrid. From the bathroom wall to the shower is literally about the dimensions of an average sized closet. To boot, you are separated from the bedroom and the shower by a thin, translucent, white curtain. (No doors) So, if you are traveling with someone else, they are forced to watch you shower and use the restroom if you like to have the light on whilst doing your business. If it\u2019s your spouse/partner, you probably aren\u2019t breaking any new ground. It\u2019s a little awkward for the kiddies though. The hotel has a club downstairs and we could hear faint traces of the music on the 10th floor. Staff- The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The bellboys in particular were outstanding. I like the fact that we could drop our luggage off before and after our check-in for a small gratuity. At night they have a security guard ensure that you have a room key before letting you on an elevator, which was a nice touch. The staff had a \u201cpretty people\u201d feel complete with model-esq 20-somethings and burly bouncers working security. Everyone was always willing to give you restaurant recommendations or call a cab should you need one. Value- I won a bid on Priceline and received this hotel. I paid $130 per night, which I feel was fair given the location and amenities. However, I would not have paid the $280 per night price tag that their website was offering. It\u2019s a good hotel if location is your highest priority.

The bathroom... oh my god... let's just say you'd better be travelling alone if you stay here. They stuck a cheap glass wall up to separate it from the bed... so effectively, you can see every detail of someone taking a shower, or worse. If you can manage to even sit on the toilet, it could be quite embarrasing. The sink is so small, that when you turn it on, water shoots everywhere. Horrible... It is obvious that at some point the rooms in this hotel were normal sized, but had been remodeled so that 2 rooms could be made out of one. You'll see floor plans here and there that show some normal sized rooms here and there. Guess we just got unlucky on that one. The good stuff... twin bed was obviously small but decent, AC worked well... um, that's about it. So much bad stuff happened during our stay there that paled in comparrison. On our second night there, the fire alarm in our room started going off at 5 in the morning. It took 3 phone calls to the lobby and finally a groggy, short tempered personal visit down there before they even attempted to fix it. Just a stupid battery and I had to spend 2 hours of the wee morning dealing with it. By the time someone finally did come to the room, the alarm had apparantly ran out of juice. Hilarious!! On our last day there, we came back to the hotel room to find a bill for 75 bucks from their restaurant... which we never set foot in. At this point, I'm like... is there someone that works for this hotel, whose job it is to make your stay as inconvenient, frustrating, and uncomfortable as possible!?!? Went down to the lobby to disbute the bill, and they made us stand there for half an hour while they tried to look for a reciept. Of course they couldn't find it, which meant that it most likely wasn't just another guest mistakenly signing his food to the wrong room... but something else entirely. Some sort of skimming by the hotel employees? See if anyone notices? The people in the lobby were for the most part, extremely rude every time there was an issue. Nobody really seemed to want to attempt to correct a situation, or even apologize for any inconvenience... Of which there were many. Sometimes there are unavoidable circumstances when things go wrong, and I can understand this. If you have a friendly and accomodating staff, they can usually keep the problems caused by these inconveniences to a minimum, sometimes even with something as simple as an apology. NOT GONNA HAPPEN HERE. At this point, somebody needs to step forward and offer an apology for this entire mess of a hotel. This hotel is NOT cheaper that any other we've stayed in in NY. Just a WHOLE LOT WORSE!!!! If you end up staying there after reading this review, you'll see what I mean. When you pull up to the hotel, there's no sign... nothing. Looks like the side of a warehouse. There's no excuse for a mess like this in such a great city. Oh, and one last thing, watch your credit card carefully upon returning from a trip to this hotel... A week after getting home, we noticed they charged us for a hotel we checked out from the concierge, claiming we didn't return it. WE SIGNED IT IN!!! HOW COULD THEY SCREW THIS UP!?!?!? Another argument over the phone and they credited us back the money. Seriously, there is some shady stuff afoot here, and someone, or many someones in this organization are trying their best to randomly charge guests for stuff they didn't use, hoping to get away with it.

I had done plenty of research prior to choosing a hotel. The Hudson isn't exactly a 'budget stay', but it is a good price when compared with other boutique hotels in NY. As for the location, I thought it was pretty good. The Columbus Circle subway station is SO close -- it was really handy. We arrived only a few hours prior to check-in time, but were told our room would not be free until that time. So we went to the restaurant to eat and kill some time. When we did finally get our room, I wasn't too shocked. I had been forwarned about the SMALL rooms, but we had booked a room for 2 ppl with 2 double beds. Good thing!! We had no issues with space in the bedroom -- it was just great for the two of us and our massive suitcases. The room was clean, crisp, and cool. Design was nice; beds were comfortable, and good linens/towels throughout. What we didn't like: 1) Not enough lights! The bathroom is the only place to do your makeup, and still a bit dim. 2) Not enough hangers in the closet (why do hotels always do that?!) 3) Not enough counter space in the bathroom for us to lay out our stuff. 4) TV etc didn't work. Am sure they would have come to fix this but we didn't bother since we weren't in the room much. As for the other hotel services: I called the concierge about a week in advance to make a bunch of lunch/dinner reservations throughout NYC. She was fantastic, and got everything booked. And, when we got to our first dinner, she had arranged for complimentary champagne -- wow!! The bar is pretty hip; love the glowing dancefloor! We only made it to the bar on a sunday night and it wasn't too busy, but not dead either. A good scene; pricey drinks (typical..!). The rest of the desk/bellboy staff was quite good. No attitude from anyone. My room bill had something extra on it that I had not ordered, and they removed it from the bill without fuss. The staff that got our bags for us and got us a taxi upon leaving were wonderful; made us sad to be leaving!

Part of this patio is for the restaurant. Part is to just hang out--until, as I came to find out, 4pm when it somehow becomes a bar. I plop down at a table at 4:15pm and promptly plug in my phone and laptop (the hotel requires to you to search for outlets--this is harder than it has to be with the dim lighting). I waitress takes my order and returns with it. At 4:25, the power is inexplicably cut from my outlets. Weird, right? I flag down the waitress at 4:30 when she says \"laptops are not allowed after 4pm b/c of liability, but I know several others are here with them, so maybe it will be OK.\" At 4:45, some guy (the bar manager) comes over and repeats this 'not allowed' stuff twice, says \"thank you\" while walking away in the condescending way that can only be done well in New York. I just paid for drinks and internet access so what do I do? Leave and argue the charge w/the front desk when I check out the next morning. The *amazing* part is that the front desk is mostly unsympathetic. The process takes 20-30min. to reverse $10 and then they require me to fill out a 'dispute form' which they will then present to the bar manager. What could possibly take them 20-30min. at the front desk to not even resolve it? This is definitely *not* The Four Seasons. The mediocre experience: I arrived from the airport 9am wanting a place just to change clothes and shower before a 10am mtg. The concierge would not give me a gym pass (to the nearby equinox) until 10am. He was breathtakingly condescending about it. The desk staff was hapless. Jackie appeared to be their manager and yet it still took 45min. to get a room. The looked at me like I was being difficult when I refused a smoking room. There is no other shower (e.g., in the hotel gym). The good stuff: capital 'a' Amazing roof top on 15. The weather was Mediterranean-perfect during my stay and this place was *the* place to be for working, relaxing, or schmoozing (like the cheezy brokerage firm that reserved part of it on one of the days I was there.) I like the decor in the lobby, restaurants and room. In multiple ways, the rooms are so small they made me involuntarily say 'wow' (that is small). I have never been in rooms so small--not in Tokyo, Singapore, or Hong Kong. Toilet is in an unfriendly location vis a vis the wall, but aside from that, the space is managed in a way that distinguishes good design. *Everything* is set up to accommodate the small space.

I have to admit we were a little disappointed on arrival to our room. We did not anticipate how small it would actually be.

The d\u00e9cor in the room is gorgeous. If the room had been fractionally larger I would have said it was perfect. Although I expect most accommodation in NYC may be similar. We were on the 19th floor which was pretty cool and throughout the night you could hear the city traffic go by (this was not a problem) The hotel has a great bar.

Pluses: The staff was very good; friendly and genuine. The location was incredible, less than a block from the 59th Street/Columbus Circle subway station. Just a few steps beyond that is Central Park. Minuses: Yes, the rooms are incredibly small, even for New York. Everything is very, very dark. It got a little depressing after a while. I should note that I was at the Hudson through Priceline. I paid $160 a night for a standard room, which was close to half of the rack rate during my visit. I arrived late Friday night. Thanks to googlemaps, I knew what to look for, as the front of the hotel has no name or number showing (I was walking; if you were in a cab or car service, this wouldn't be a problem). The big yellow window across the width of the entire hotel made it pretty easy to find. The lobby is up the famous yellow escalator. It is quite amazing, with the moss or ivy growing across the ceiling. Unfortunately, it is directly next to the Hudson Lounge, with no wall in between. The music from the lounge made it necessary to literally shout with the woman at the front desk as I checked in. She would shout a question, and I would shout my answer. Not exactly a tranquil way to check in. My room was on the 12th floor, so the noise from the lounge was not an issue. I was next to the service elevators and stairs (a result of reserving through Priceline?), but I was not bothered by noise from those, either. I've stayed as some hotels with really small rooms, but I think this is the smallest room I have ever seen. The entire room is 150 square feet; there are large mirrors on both sides of the room to give the illusion of more space. There was really no place to put my suitcase; when I put it on the floor, it made it very difficult to walk around the bed. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was fine, but I am certainly glad I was not here on business. The room, even with all the lights on, was really dark. I tried to call the front desk to set up a wake up call, but the room was so dark I could not see which button on the phone was for wake up calls! I finally just punched 0 for the hotel operator. The \"desk\" in the room was so small, it really wasn't suited for any kind of work. Not to mention the lighting wasn't suited to working, either. I didn't have a computer with me, so I can't comment on the internet access in the room, for which there is a charge. The head of the bed is up against the heater/air conditioner (as mentioned in other reviews). It was a bit loud, which didn't bother me, but I can see where light sleepers could be bothered. What I don't understand from other reviews are the mentions of the air blowing directly on people as they slept. At least in my room, the bed was lower than the fan unit, and the air was blowing straight up, so I don't understand how that could be a problem. The configuration may be different in other rooms, however. As to the air conditioner itself, it was not working very well the morning of my departure. I don't know, however, if that was my unit not working, or if it was the entire hotel. The outdoor temperature had been over 90 degrees for three straight days, so maybe the entire hotel was warm; I don't know. The bathroom was larger than I had feared it might be, which was a relief. The products supplied were nice, and the shower worked well. I should point out there is a large window in the wall separating the bath from the bed area (to make the room seem larger?), with only a sheer curtain to block the view. If two people are sharing this room, they had better be really close! If you don't want to see your roommate using the bathroom, this probably isn't the hotel for you! There were plenty of elevators, so I never had to wait long, but, oddly enough, they were very warm, uncomfortably so. Again, I don't know if the air conditioning was not working properly, but it was weird to get on the elevator and get hit with a blast of hot air. I didn't visit any of the bars or the Hudson Cafeteria, so I can't speak to any of them. I was planning on grabbing a quick breakfast Monday morning at the Cafeteria, but the line was down the hallway, and I didn't have time to wait, so maybe next time. As I didn't have a computer with me, I was planning on using the business center to quickly check email once or twice a day. There is absolutely no mention of it on the website, but there is a charge to use the computers: $6.95 for fifteen minutes. On the plus side, if you want to check in for any air travel online, there is no charge to do that; the computers are set up to allow that without having to purchase time, which is a good thing. To summarize, I would consider staying here in the future if I was visiting on my own, and could get a good deal. I would not pay full price for this hotel, and I definitely would not stay here with my wife, unless I got a larger room. But I should reiterate, the staff was wonderful. I had a lovely chat with the doorman as I waited for my car to pick me up. He had to be hot, and he was very busy, but he still chatted with me as he worked, which he didn't need to do, and I thought spoke to the effort the staff makes to please the guests.

Overall, though, it was a very satisfactory stay. I got the room through Priceline for $180 per night. However, when I emailed the hotel to request a room with two beds, I was told that I'd have to upgrade which would cost an additional $90 per night. That was a negative, but I chalk it up to Priceline's policies, not the hotel's. Priceline obviously isn't for people who need a specific type of hotel room configuration. Pluses: 1. The room, number 1109, was very clean and plenty big enough for the two of us. 2. The beds were comfy, if a bit low to the ground, with nice, squishy pillows. 3. The shower had incredible water pressure, as did the toilet. 4. The air conditioner worked like a dream, which was important during the 90+ degree weather that we experienced. 5. The staff that we encountered was friendly and helpful. I especially liked that there was someone checking for room keys before you could get on the elevators to go up to your room. Minuses: 1. There were very few outlets in the room, and the ones I found were in inconvenient locations. 2. The lighting was minimal, especially if you wanted to read at night. 3. No towel racks in the bathroom, so even if you wanted to use your towels again, there was no place to hang them to dry. 4. Dark hallways 5. No name or address numbers on the front of the building...I just thought that was strange. Overall, our stay was very satisfactory. The hotel is located across the street from a subway station, but we walked the 16 blocks to Times Square with no problem. Also, there are several nice coffee shops nearby that are open 24 hours. We especially liked the Flame Diner on the corner of 9th and 58th. I don't think I'd pay full price to stay here, but if I got a good deal, I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.

Its a great location, right beside Columbus Circle and just on the South West corner of Central Park (where all the buggies line up to offer you a ride). The Hotel is essentially a nightclub. There were people standing outside (smokers) as we rocked up in our cab on the first evening and as we went up the illuminated yellow escalotors into the lobby, house music pumped throughout. Very fun atmosphere and fabulous music!. The lobby is a glorified conservatory - there is ivy covering the ceiling and the reception desk runs along the back wall. The staff were very friendly (although had to wait about 40 mins for our luggage to be brought up to our room once we had checked in). Be warned! Everything is very dim-lit in this place! (a common theme in NY it seems). Our room was on the top floor. We had a deluxe room (basically 2 double beds and a bathroom), Do not expect to have much space, we paid top dollar to have this room as we had heard that the other rooms in this hotel (and everywhere else in NYC are teeny tiny). It was definately worth spending that bit extra. Lovely soft linen, comfortable beds, lots of mirrors but so so so dark. The bathroom was basic. It was jazzed up by the modern sink but the shower was aged and needed a re-vamp. But the water pressure was good and it was clean and thats what counts. We could hear quite alot of noise from the room next door at night. People who had obviously spent their evening in the bar downstairs and had come up to carry on their drinking. Not great but it was ok. We did wonder why everyhting (even in the corridors) was so dark and we concluded that it was a good mask for the peeling paintwork and pretty drab corridor decor. But the rest of the hotel and the City make up for the couple of bad points this palce has. We didnt drink grab a drink at the bar as there were so many other places we wanted to hit in Manhattan, but it looked great and was heaving on Friday and Saturday night. Great music also! The terrace bar looked very lovely but was just thatt little bit too cold to sit out while we were there. The Hudson was a great place to stay. It is very cool and had alot to offer. Very New York.

We fell in love with the Morgan Hotel Group after staying at the Mondrian in LA in 2004, so we decided to book at one of their hotels in New York. Being we weren't going to have much time at the hotel, we booked at the least expensive of the three hotels in the city. When we first pulled up in the taxi there were no signs with the name of the hotel but we knew we were there because of the muffled green lighting coming from the front windows. This was definitely a Morgan Group Hotel. After checking our bags we were sent through the doors and directly up an escalator. When we reached the top we had to take a second look as it almost felt as if we were outside. The walls and ceiling were covered in green moss. We walked up to the counter and for some reason the first thing I felt to ask was about the history of the building. The building it self just had a strong presence as if you knew something special had happened there. The woman at the front desk explained that it was originally a woman's dormatory and then years later was actually the filming location for Sesame Street of all things! Walking up to our room we definitely recognized the \"dormatory\" part of it with the dark narrow hallways. And I have to admit I initially had mixed feelings when I walked into the room. I knew it was going to be small, but this room was tiny. Of course I though wow - $260 doesn't get you much in NYC! But as I settled down and really looked around I realized how well they used the space that was there to make it feel modern and sexy. A lot of it was in the lighting but they knew what they were doing and I suddenly liked it. And how much time to do spend in your room in NYC anyway? We first went down the Cafeteria (which I am told was one of the Sesame Street shooting locations) and had some drinks and appetizers. They did an excellent job with this restaurant preserving the historical feel while embracing modern ambiance. The food was minimal but excellent and the mixed drink selection made me want to stay all night. But we left and went on to the live music/bar/dance area. I thought it was pretty funny that they kept the reserved signs on the premium tables even though no one had rented them, so I decided to sit down. No one seemed to care, except my fiance of course! After that we went on to the Library which was one of my favorite parts of the hotel. An old traditional library complete with the rolling ladders to climb up and grab a book. We sat down in some very cozy chairs and I decided to get us a couple glasses of champagne (since I am a sucker for the stuff and they had six bottles on ice just sitting there waiting to be consumed!) Well, I have to admit I can be a bit of a snob at times and yes I do appreciate the finer things in life, but happened next shocked the hell out of me. I asked for two GLASSES of champagne (and believe me, they were not extra large or anything). The bartender said something that sounded like \"fifteen\" so at first I thought , wow - what a bargain for NYC! Until of course handed him a twenty, about to say keep the change, and he leaned over and said \"No, I said FIFTY.\" Yes, fifty, as in 5-0 for two tiny glasses of what was probably $10 champagne. Well, my wow-I-got-a-bargain smile quickly turned into an embarrassed grin as I took my $20 back and handed him my credit card! What was I supposed to do? Say nevermind? Ya, right - I'm supposd to ne a snob! I don't think I mentioned to my fiance how much the champagne I bought us cost, but I know I made him sit there until we finished every last drop! In a nut shell, this is definitely a place to stay if you are in the city and you want to stay somewhere chic yet you don't want to spend your retirement (just stay away from the champagne!)

We did get upgraded to a \"double delux\" room, which was perfectly adequate in terms of size. (So we did not have the problem with the microscopic standard rooms.) Except for the lack of hot water and broken window (see below), the room was very comfortable. There are some nice things about this hotel. It's cool in a shabby-chic way, and hopping on Friday/Saturday night. The front desk staff was very nice and courteous, and the rooms spotlessly clean. The location is great. There is a glaring, awful problem with this hotel: NO HOT WATER!!! Apparently, the hot water heater is inadequate for the number of rooms, so except for one brief 5-minute window at approximately 1 p.m., the water was just barely above cold the entire time we were there. It wasn't even really lukewarm, so we had to take cold showers! Also, our window latch was broken, so when there were high winds overnight, our window blew in all night (it was about 25 degrees out), and we finally had to prop chairs against it. Still, a draft got in all night. We didn't bother to change rooms because we were checking out the next morning and it was very late, and we didn't want to repack all our stuff. And the prices for hotel breakfast are ridiculous. I expect inflated prices in NYC, but $8 for a single glass of orange juice (not fresh squeezed). $5 regular coffee??? $18 eggs? That is just silly. Breakfast was $70. (Tip: There is a Whole Foods with a buffet (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) right across the street in the Time Warner center.) We got in at 11 pm at night so we also ate dinner at the Hudson...which was also expensive ($25-$35/entree, wines starting about $14/glass), but it seemed normal for NYC and the food was decent. Our dinner for two cost only a couple dollars more than breakfast! Another problem - not the hotel's fault - is the fire station down the road. Apparently the local drivers of vehicles with sirens take pleasure in playing with the sirens during the day (making silly noises at each other), which is a pain if one is trying to nap or sleep in late. Other than the lack of hot water, I would have been okay with this hotel at the price we paid.

The bathroom is great, yet this shower curtain was like some sort of cheap window treatment. It just flows in the breeze and water leaks everywhere.

We arrived at the hotel extemly late after a 5 hour delay and were welcomed with a warm and friendly smile by the Front Desk Agent. As he made small talk we proceeded with the check in process and he explained that we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite. We were very happy with that after hearing that the standard rooms are rather small. When we got to the room were were suprised to see how much they did with the space. The living room was off the foyer and their was a long hallway leading to the bedroom and a very large walk in closet and very large bathroom. (only downside no tub). The design of the room is great with beautiful hardwood floors and wood walls, it gives it a very cabin like feel. They also are redoing their TV's as I was told, so if you are into that thing in Manhattan you will be excited to see a large flat screen in the living room and a 27\" in the bedroom. (but it is NYC, so why be stuck in the room.) As it had been an extremly long day we were off to bed and happy to notice that we did not hear any bar noise as previously mentioned. We were on the 8th floor. The next day we woke up and were very happy to noitce that there are two Starbucks with in a stone's through of the hotel. Also their is a CVS and a grocery store where you can get what you need. I loved the fact that they had vending machine's on the floor and they were hidden behind a door that said \"Eat\" of \"Drink\" the prices were not bad either $2 door a soda is pretty cheap. We went out and enjoyed the city that day, we took the subway to SOHO and shopped and realized that we did like our hotel not in the middle of everything but rather a place to escape to. The subway is a block away and if that is not close enough for you, you have some issues. That evening we had a late night dinner in the Hudson Cafeteria and the food was great comfort food with an elegant twist. The bar was very inviting and the staff always made you feel welcome. My favorite was Library bar where you could sit infront of the Fire and enjoy a cocktail and a book. What I love about Morgans Hotel Groups property's is the attention to Detail and the amazing peices of furniture that they have in the rooms and the lobby. I went to the W union Square to see what all the hype is about. It looks like nothing more than a Westin with a couple of contemporary pecies from Pottery Barn. I would never stay at another hotel in NYC. Other than Royalton or Morgans, and I can not wait to see the new Mondrian they will be opening in SOHO.

It turned out to be the Hudson. After reading the reviews, I was horrified to think of what kind of closet I would be staying in. However, since it was a \"done deal\", I had no choice. The Hudson is on W 58th Street, but you need to know the address as there is absolutely no signage whatsoever. Upon arriving via taxi, I was greeted by a very nice and personable door man and he was very accomidating from the get-go. You enter the lobby through the ground floor and take escalators to the main lobby. I have to admit, the lobby is quite nice with dark wood and low light. Be sure the check out the light fixture hanging over the right side of the check in desk. The check in clerk was extremely nice, but check in took a bit longer than I was used to; There were some extra forms to fill out since Hotwire had listed my home address as theirs, and the hotel wanted mine. I then went to my room, expecting the worst as far as side. What I found was accurate. My room was on the 23rd floor(top floor) which was good, because it was both away from the bar noise and street noise for the most part. The room itself was TINY. I thought to myself that everything in it was mini- the tv, the toilet, etc. I am 6'2 and weigh 240; my partner is 6'1 and weighs 180; it was very difficult for us to be in the room other than to sleep. The sleeping room itself was probably 8x5 at best and the bathroom was probably 2x6. I have never seen a smaller room in my life. The bed itself was a queen and the linens were nice and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom had a mini tub with a shower, which was open to the bedroom via a thin curtain; not too good if you did not know your roommate too well. The toiletries provided were nice though and there was daily maid service. The room itself was very clean, but again how much was there to really clean? Breakfast at the Hudson Cafeteria was expensive, but then this is NYC. A breakfast buffet for two was $67.00; it was good, but really there are tons of small family owned restaurants in the neighborhood where you can get a great breakfast for under $8 a person. The bar at the Hudson is always packed; be prepared for large crowds and loud music. However, being on the top floor, I didnt hear a thing. Pros: Clean and Convienent. Its only a short walk to Times Square and the theater district. Its safe and an easy walk. The Subway at Columbus Circle is about a block.. Nice staff and accomidating staff Cons: SMALL room; I would have been disappointed if I had paid more than $149.00. However, for that price it was a good deal and very clean. I definitely would not stay there and pay full price; if you can snag a deal for under $175, then its a good choice. I would stay again if I can get a deal as it is very, very close to everything and at least clean.

Its bar, restaurant and library bar are all lovely, but it's so popular and has such limited seating, that unless you've reserved before you even arrive, it's impossible to get a seat to have a drink there because all of the non-resident guests that flock to the hotel. We went into the bar and library on three or four occassions only to be confronted with 100% of the seats and tables being \"reserved\". We also had to wait until 10.30 pm to eat dinner on the first night (after arriving at 8 ish) because of the queue. The hotel is funky though. On the room front - just don't go there! The room is basically a bed plus a foot either side to walk around. The bathroom is a box that is separated from the bedroom by a window with a thin curtain over it and is no wider than 3 foot. You can't actually go to the toilet without having your legs facing sideways as your knees would bang against the wall! On our last day and night there, no-one made up our room all day. We called at 5.30pm to report this and ask for it to be done, but when we returned at 8 pm it still wasn't. We therefore called again pretty unhappy (as had no water and no clean towels for a shower), and when we returned from dinner at 11 pm it still wasn't done. This was pretty unacceptible, especially as we had to leave at 5 am the next morning. I called the Duty Manager to complain, but he just told me his records showed it had been made up and that someone had tried to come 5 times to make up the room, but we hadn't let them in. I explained that we had asked for it to be done when we knew we were out, as there was no way it could have been done with us standing in the 1 ft of space around the bed, to which he said \"you have asked for an additional service, and therefore need to be there to let the chambermaid in\". I explained it wasn't an additional service to get your room made up once a day, to which he said that his records showed it had already been made up .... I invited him to come to our room to show him that it hadn't been made up, but he said that as we were now in the room, that would prove nothing. He basically intimated that i was lying about the room not being made up and kept repeating his line about the records showing ... blah blah blah .... as you can see this was a bit of a circular argument, which wound me up immensly and got me nowhere. when i complained when back in the UK, I was \"thanked\" for my feedback and told that they hoped i would stay again.

There has been alot said by previous reviewers regarding the room size, we booked a deluxe with a queen bed, but were given a king bed. The room was very small, I asked the front desk if they had given us a standard room in error, but they hadn't so I can only guess how cramped they are! The bathroom is tiny and would be difficult to use if you are tall. The design of the rooms and the decor however is very contemporary and smart like the whole hotel interior (just don't bring too many suitcases) The bar's are very swanky, however, the main bar is obviously a trendy hangout for locals, so is very packed on weekends. There is a long queue to get in, however if you produce your room key you can skip the queue. The service is very good in the Hudson and the maid service as good as I have seen. The concierge and door men etc. are excellent also and will grab taxis for you immediately.

This was our 4th visit to NYC and we wanted to stay in a different area and we have stayed in other Morgan hotels previously and have always enjoyed our stay, so we thought we would give The Hudson a go. We reviewed what other travellers had written so we decided to up grade to a loft suite, which is something we would recommend if you can afford it. Our room was small by suite standards so we can only believe the other reviews about the size of the rooms !! To be honest, if you want a comfortable, clean and well kept room, which our was, we would recommend this hotel, particularly if you like contemporary hotels. However, much of what everyone else writes about is true and we would urge you to consider these before deciding whether to stay here or not:- The staff at the Hudson could possibly win the award for the most rudest, unhelpful and unapproachable staff award - everything seemed too much and no one went out of their way to help you; The corridors do need some modernising and we understand why there is dim lighting everywhere - to hide the stains and the poorly kept corridors!!!; By the end of our visit the staff had got on our nerves so much we phoned the manager to explain that they should look on www.tripadvisor.com to read what their guests are saying and explained how rude we thought the staff were - the managements response \u201cI am sorry to hear about that\u201d - clearly they are not bothered, so why should their staff !!!! The room however was very noisy (road traffic, bar noise and neighbouring rooms) and kept you awake on and off all night and our window had a draft so you would wake up in the night due to being cold !!! I think it is fair to say that you have to accept a little noise wherever you stay in NYC, but this place was a new level !!! Overall, we cannot fault our room as it had everything we wanted (except maybe not to have a draft and the windows to be noise proofed !!), however, due to the staff at The Hudson we wouldn\u2019t choose to stay here again, particularly not for $550 plus tax a night when there are so many other options in Manhattan. There is a great Diner called Flame one block from the hotel (turn left outside of hotel and you will see it) and a great Irish Bar called Kennedy\u2019s just around the corner on 57th Street on 7th.

We were greeted fairly quickly at the check-in desk, and the guy helping us gave us the option for having a shower or bath, we chose shower. Everything was covered before we received our keys, and yes they do hold an extra $300 on your card if any damages should happen to the room.

We also could hear some noise from the street, but hello! That is new York! It did not keep us awake at night at all. My ONLY complaint is that the maid cleaned our room (every single day in fact) even when our \"privacy please\" was hanging on the door, which turned out to be nice after all. My knees did touch the wall while on the toilet :) They provide very nice products for the bathroom. The T.V. was 13 inches, but we had a lot of channels.

Tourists and businesspersons alike should steer clear. Yes, the bar is trendy, and I certainly recommend coming in for a drink--and then fleeing the dank, unkind environs for one of dozens of New York hotels providing decent service and amenities at Hudson rates. If you stay here, you should expect even the most basic requests to go unmet, including: (1) A quiet room. The first five floors of the hotel pulsate with music until the bar closes at 3 AM. And yes, the hotel's midtown location is nice, but sirens on 57th Street are audible all the way to your bedroom, and staff will refuse a polite request to move you to a reasonably quiet room. (2) Hot water in the shower. I stood in cold showers on three of the six mornings I was at this hotel. \"Maintenance\" efforts included coming to my room and leaving the water on for hours at a time, hoping that it would warm up. The staff moved my room three times without apology or compensation. (3) Reliable internet or fax. An urgent fax sat at the front desk for hours, and the manager was puzzled that this bothered me. The in-room wireless shuts off at random at least once an hour. It's also $10 a day, and that's before they inevitably overcharge you: I was at the hotel for only six days but was charged $90 for access. (4) Reliable wake-up calls. The front desk called me at the right time on about three of my six days. On the rest, they didn't call at all or called an hour early. If you stay here, set an alarm. (5) Timely room service. The front desk's mantra is that they have \"nothing to do with the restuarant or bar,\" because both are run by another company. As a result, should your room service order be delayed, cold, or wrong (mine were, variously, all three), expect nothing from the front desk--even though the hotel will charge you a $10 delivery fee. (6) Redress of complaints. I've stayed at hundreds of hotels over the years, and all of the above have gone wrong for me before. (Albeit rarely all at once, and never at these rates.) Still, for $450 a night you might think that you would get a sympathetic and competent ear to help you. Think again. The Hudson's staff is almost defiantly unhelpful. All of these complaints were met with disinterest rather than regret; the front desk manager literally shrugged when I described the above experiences. At bottom, if you stay at this hotel you should expect that basic requests will not be met, and that the staff will not care. If you are a tourist, this may simply deprive you of sleep; if you are traveling on business, the inconveniences can be professionally disastrous. If, like me, you have visited the bar or restaurant and found them trendy and fun and are thus tempted to stay here, save yourself the trouble. The bar is great, and you should certainly visit the restuarant as well, but do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere.

The outdoor patio area is beautiful also on a nice night (closes at 11pm). Basically, if you're traveling single and on business for 1-2 nights, this hotel is manageable. Any more than that (I stayed for 4 nights), and it's time to shift to the Marriot. I don't see the point in staying here for $450+, when you can get many more conveniences at another hotel for the same rate. Unfortunately, I was stuck here on business. Oh, and good luck finding the hotel (most cabbies seem to know where it is though). No name outside. No number. Take a good look at the pics on the website so you can recognize it. Also, be prepared for a lot of neon-ish green lighting wherever you go.

OUR STORY!! We chose the Hudson for our first trip to NYC after saving for 18 months. we chose the larger double room as we'd been told the standards are tiny. we were greated (or not) by an unenthusiastic lady who didnt make eye contact or conversation througout our checkin. she gave us a room which was next to the generator.. so loud that I had to raise my voice to speak to my boyfriend.. i wouldnt have normally asked but we asked for a room change as we needed sleep after a long flight. the lady at reception said 'you'll get a smaller room if you change!!' but at this point i was so tired I didnt care I just said 'ok thats fine!' - very rude when you think that I paid extra for a larger one! the new room was nice. very cool, very trendy.. clean and big enough to fit our suitcases in.. i was happy at last. (pillows and sheets are devine!!) we would ask for our travelers cheques to be changed to dollars and they'd make you feel like you're making them go out of your way.... so rude!! everything was fine until we woke up on the 4th of our 5th night with ants crawling all over me.. i was like 'OMG how did they get in our room on the 14th floor??' we called room service and they sent the cleaning lady who said 'im very sorry, we have never seen this before in the whole time ive worked here!' we need to investigate it so please can you pack and we'll get you a new room.. so we were taken to a double room (it was massive!!). instead of waiting around we continued sight seeing and when we arrived back to the hotel we went to see the manager at the desk. she was awful and when we said 'What are you going to do? dont you think we deserve some form of compensation for finding ants in our stuff and us losing a whole morning of our holiday? she simply said 'we dont know how they got there.. we're investigating it.. what do you want me to do about it?' she must have thought we'd dome it dilliberatly or something cos of her tone.. so insetad of arguing with someone who didnt want to help we asked to speak to the main manager.... the main manager took us to her office and was extreemly appologetic. she appologised for the staff being unhelpful and assured us again that this was an isolated case. we didnt get money off (apparently this isnt part of the procedures) but we did get a free nights stay to be used within 12 months - which never got used as its not like i'd ever go to NYV for one night LOL The whole ant thing was a joke - so badly delt with.

Positives to begin with! Good location, near central park and a lovely mall which has some great bars, including a jazz lounge. Extemely clean and modern hotel. It dosen't really look like a hotel from outside as there isn't a grand lobby, just lifts up to reception. Once you go up the lifts it has the wow factor! Three great bars, two being on the first floor. One very modern with a glass floor and later on loud music and dancing which we felt was more for the teeny boppers and didn't go in. The other is very chilled and swish. It is outside,lovely furnishings, very sexy waitresses in chinese style robes with rather large splits up the sides!! (much to the fellows delight!) Our favourite was the roof top bar, great ambience and fab views at night. The room was very clean and modern. Negatives were the entrance as mentioned above. A few nice potted trees and you have said all. The hotel is very dark inside, the lobby, the hallways and the rooms. You may love this or hate it.

I agree with some of the positive and most of the negative reviews on the property. I stayed at the Hudson for a week while on business ...maybe if I had been on vacation I would feel different. The positives: 1. The bed (although only about 6 inches off the ground) was comfortable 2. Good quality toiletries in the bathroom 3. Excellent food (had the Lamb Shank - wonderful) 4. The 15th floor roof top garden 5. My room was clean (although the hallways were trashed) The negatives 1. The noise. The rooms are essentially above a night club. Every night there is throbbing music coming from the outdoor lobby bar and indoor dance floor. I was on the 7th floor facing the bar and was kept awake by the noise until after midnight. I am not a light sleeper by any means and I am used to sleeping in NYC hotels that are not renowned for their quietness. My bed was vibrating slightly from the blaring base. Again, maybe if I didn't have to get up early for a business meeting this wouldn't have bothered me but being kept up until after midnight and getting up at 5am killed me by the end of the week. My colleague was on the 9th floor and had the same problem. She called the desk to beg to be moved to a higher floor - they couldn't accommodate her but brought her complimentary ear-plugs. 2. The tiny rooms - although I knew the room were itty-bitty teeny-weeny little things, you can't imagine how small the rooms are until you experience them. I bumped my knees on the wall everytime I had to use the toilet. I didn't have enough room to unpack a week's worth of clothing and other bits and pieces of travel gear. When I checked in and first saw my room, I didn't think it was so bad, but by the end of the week I felt like I was in a coffin. Again - if I were on vacation and out and about playing in NYC maybe I wouldn't care but I had to work in my room and it wasn't pleasant. 3. Darkness - I can only sum it up this way...I knew I was in trouble when I saw a man use the light on his ipod to illuminate his watch to see what time it was. Ok for midnight but this was the middle of the day, in the Lobby!!! The mood lighting was okay for a while but by the end of the week, darn it, I just wanted to be able to see what I was doing! 4. Moldy smell. I was in room 744 and when I would take a shower, the room would get steamy and smell damp for the rest of the evening. Given how tiny the rooms are its not hard to steam up the room (5 minutes in the shower!) I didn't see any mold but could smell it. There were 4 of us in my group and we all had the same problem with the smell. The Hudson was on my company's list as an approved business hotel but given our experiences last week the hotel will be removed from the list. I have been traveling for the company for 7 years and have never felt that a property was so inappropriate for business travel. We live and learn! The Hudson has very little to offer the business traveler and is better suited to those looking for a unique experience in a boutique hotel. It is also better suited to smokers and those who keep late hours and enjoy loud music. In moment of frustration after I bumped my head or knees for the 10th time, I might say that if you are over 3 feet tall, you may want to look elsewhere too given how small the rooms are. Miscellaneous Notes: 1. The 15th floor garden is supposed to close at 10:00pm. Every night of my stay they closed it early. This is the only quiet place in the hotel so this was disappointing. 2. The hallways are dark, dirty and seedy looking. 3. I left some jewelry in the safe in my room (I know, I know, I'm an idiot!) and so far I have called 3 times, left my call back number three time and have not gotten a call back. Pretty indicative of their guest service - there really isn't any to speak of. 4. For $589 a night, it was a disappointment. Maybe for $99 a night it would be ok... Given the number of wonderful hotels in NYC, there is no need to endure small, dark, moldy rooms in a hotel that can't decide if it is indeed a hotel or a night club. My advice...stay elsewhere whether you are traveling on business or for pleasure.", "Date": "October 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queens, New York", "Title": "\u201cFelt Like a celebrity\u201d", "Author": "tmoo6", "ReviewID": "UR10018426", "Content": "I booked this hotel by winning a bid on priceline.

The downside: The rooms are closets. It is hard to fit two people in the rooms. The air quality was poor. It was difficult to hear the TV over the air conditioner. The hallways are creapy and nasty...gray walls with gray carpet with little yellow lights above room doors. You could see stains on the carpet. I felt uncomfortable int he hallways...way too dark.

On the other side of the lobby is the indoor bar/disco. To the side is a large \"library\" which is quieter, has a pool table and a fireplace and internet access as well as bar facilities. For the standard room, you pay a bit much because the rooms are beautifully decorated but tiny. Both times we stayed we asked the staff to upgrade us and they did a great job. This time the hotel was a bit busy but the receptionist searched and found us a perfect room, a bit larger and very quiet. Plus she was very friendly, chatting with us about our vacation and sharing experiences. Overall, I think it is a great find. If you are into the trend scene (I'm not), there is a lot of that.

There was no tea and coffee making facility, the closet space was tiny, the music sytem had a cassett player (how ancient is that), and the TV reception was awful. We asked for a room with a view and boy, did we regret that. The noise from the NYC traffic kept us up for most of the night until we finally plucked up the courage to ask for a different room.

There are no drawers or floor space for a suitcase. Unless you plan on unpacking your toiletries to the shelves in the bathroom and hanging your clothes, you will be cramped. The toiletries are awesome, but the shower is a tiny stall, one wall of which is a window to the bed. There is a curtain if you want to avoid giving your bedmate a full view while showering or using the toilet. This means that 2 wet curtains will blow and stick to you while showering. The paneling is peeling off the walls. The beds are awful. I had thought they were merely mediocre until I spent the weekend with there with my boyfriend. One person can roll around, 2 people will roll to the middle and find no comfort. I used to think the lobby was worth it. Never again.

Upon opening the door to our room we were presented with a space that had the approximate dimensions and aroma of a small ashtray. Reception regretfully informed us the hotel was full and that we could only be moved the next day. Well it was a pretty disgusting night. The bedding reeked, and my girlfriend woke coughing during the night. There were lots of other niggles: blocked sinks, room doors that required a \"special knack\" to open them, mini bar charges for items not consumed, bell hops that failed to deliver things when promised. In each case staff were apologetic, courteous and helpful, but you can't get over the fact that this hotel has some systemic problems and is preoccupied with being \"edgy\" instead of efficient.

I am truly amazed that they have passed legal requirements. 2) the prices of everything are INSULTING. 3) the amenities are a bad, bad joke. We had NO free wireless in room, NO wardrobe, NO chest of drawers, NO fridge. The hi-fi was so old that the cassette deck was the main feature. The tv was cheap, old and tiny. The double bed was the smallest I have ever seen and the bathroom was no bigger than a decent sized wardrobe. 4) I like dance music, i like clubs - however I don't appreciate heavy loud techno blaring until 3 or 4 in the morning every night - just below my room. 5) you can literally touch the snobbery and arrogance.

The nightclub atmosphere was REALLY loud in the main lobby, but I heard nothing in my room and I'm a light sleeper and we were very close to the elevators.

We were very tired and started to be worried. We could not contact our bank because in our country (due to time difference) everything was closed. But we used our credict cards on the airport, the mini bus transfer, some shops and they were just fine.

So, we asked them to try them again, but they could not use them since they were declined and we had to wait for the next day. We still was tired and nervous. We went again back to the reception at 07:00 in the morning and our credit cards were declined again. We were desperated. We could use them all over New York but not in the Hotel. We contacted our bank again to tell us once more that our cards are OK and there is a problem with the hotel system which did not sent them enough information. So, we then tried to find ATM to get some cash, cancelled our fisrt day programme in the city and when we came to the reception with the cash, they just wanted 150 dollars per night for incidental charges (mini bar, telephone, etc), that is 8 nights X 150 = 1200 dollars. A BIG AMOUNT. In no other hotel I was asked to do this. Anyway, we gave only 150 after a long discussion because simply we did not have any more. After we settled down our accomodation we had a great week in NYC, we calmed down. And... at the check-out, 03:30 in the morning we went again to the reception to ask for the 150 dollars back and the lady there simply told us that she could not give them because there was a problem (?) with their system. And our taxi was waiting to get us to the airport. By that time I got very nervous and started to complain for everything and after 10 minutes she just gave us our money back. I do not know, but all this experience was very stressfull and we could not expect it to happen in a hotel. I do not know who the fault really is but since we could use our credit cards in the city, I come to the conclusion that the hotel's system is not compatible with credit cards from all the countries, something they should have taken care of. Finally, even if we liked the hotel, we will not stay there again because now we know they do not accept out credit cards !!!", "Date": "August 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for hip night owls, not so good for families.\u201d", "Author": "blimpie71", "ReviewID": "UR8362435", "Content": "This hotel was $359/night which is high but seemed to be the going rate for a decent room in August.

You can only drink something you've purchased at their bar. As we expected from the reviews, the rooms were very small but that was okay. I liked that they had dark wood laminate flooring instead of carpet and a washable duvet cover. I would not recommend the Hudson if you're looking for a quiet room. We could clearly hear people on the patio and lots of traffic noise, even with the windows closed. Our main complaint was the shower stall. The curtain wasn't long enough so water spilled all over the small bathroom floor. We ended up wasting lots of towels cleaning it all up. Overall, I'd say this place is hip and modern and a great place to stay if you're young, not going to be spending a lot of time in the room or you're going to be going to the Hudson bar at night. The location's good too. I would stay again if I got a great deal, but if you can get a place like the Parker Meridien, where I stayed a few years ago, for the same money, I'd stay there, just because the rooms are bigger and quieter, and maybe even a bit cleaner.

Unfortunately, The Hudson Hotel is beautiful, but terrifically loud. The rooms are also very small. I should point out that I've rated my overall experience as 'Okay, but some problems'. That is because the design of the hotel is exquisite. The lobby, restaurant, and bar were all hip, playful, and out of the ordinary. My room had hardwood floors, beautiful, modernist wood paneling on the walls and cool furniture. If my experience had ended there, I would've rated it a 5 (excellent). Unfortunately, an uncomfortable bed, excessive noise and a staff that seemed uncaring knocked the rating down considerably. The first night of my stay I climbed into a bed that was decidedly uncomfortable. I should point out that I normally sleep on a platform bed with a very firm mattress. Most hotel beds feel cushy to me. But not the one in my room at The Hudson! It felt similar to what you would expect from a fold-out bed in a sleeper sofa. It seemed to have no padding whatsoever and was rather uncomfortable. Also, the sheets were a scratchy poly/cotton blend which surprised me as I expected a hotel of this caliber would have all cotton sheets. The next morning, I awoke with a startle to the sound of someone opening and closing the door to my room. This went on several times over the course of the next hour. I finally realized it was the sound of my neighbors going into and coming out of their rooms. They weren't slamming their doors. They were simply opening and closing them in a normal fashion. And every time someone opened/closed the door to their room, it sounded EXACTLY like someone opening and closing the door to MY room. It was very disconcerting and completely interfered with my sleep. I also heard car horns and sirens much more clearly than I would have expected given that I was on the ninth floor. At one point I tried to increase the speed of the fan on the A/C unit hoping that it would create white noise to drown out the noise from the street. Instead, the increased speed of the fan simply caused a rattling noise in the A/C. (Another note about the A/C is that it never seemed to get the room quite cool enough. That's a bummer when it's 100 degrees and humid outside.) The rooms at The Hudson are famously small. All my friends who heard I was staying at The Hudson immediately said, \"Is your room tiny?\". Indeed, I thought it was. But when the bellman was helping me get settled into my room he asked me how I liked it. I said, \"Well, it sure is cozy!\". He responded by saying \"This is actually one of the larger rooms in the hotel.\" In fact, the room was so small I didn't feel as though I had a great deal of privacy. Given the size of the room and the poor soundproofing anyone in the hallway could have heard anything I said or did in the room. Let's just say it was good that I was travelling alone. On the second day that I was there, I heard glass breaking just outside my door. A few minutes later, a friend entered the room and that's when I saw that someone had damaged a light fixture just above my door and tiny shards of glass were all over the carpet. And of course, my friend tracked the glass into my room. I called housekeeping, explained that there was broken glass in the hallway and just inside the door of my room. When I returned several hours later, the glass had been removed from the hallway, but not from inside my room. After calling again, the glass was finally removed from inside my room. When I checked out I had to return my wireless internet device to the concierge desk. When she asked how I enjoyed my stay I told her that in all honesty the room was so noisy I found it difficult to sleep. Her only response was to say \"Wow. That's too bad.\" Then I approached the front desk to check out. I explained to the clerk that I had never requested a reduction in the price of a hotel room before, but that I was unable to sleep due to the noise and would appreciate some reduction in room rate. He smirked in an exceedingly smug way and said I'd have to speak to the manager. He disappeared to find the manager. He took so long returning that I became concerned that the driver picking me up for my ride to the airport was having to wait for me. So, I simply gave up and left the hotel. I would recommend The Hudson only to those who are so obsessed with interior design that the beauty of the rooms and the public spaces would outweigh the fact that the rooms are tiny and noisy.", "Date": "August 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cHudson was good\u201d", "Author": "Tuuli", "ReviewID": "UR8264304", "Content": "We stayed in Hudson from July 17th to 24th.

If you want a place where you can relax in your room, stay somewhere else! As you approach this hotel on 58th Street, there is no sign. I had read reviews and looked at pictures so I knew that when I saw the trees and the funny yellow windows, I was probably in the right place. The subway station at Columbus Circle is about a block and a half away so not too bad even if you are lugging bags and such (as we were). When you enter the hotel, you go up a LONG escalator (very cool) to the lobby area. The lobby is very large and open and includes lots of greenery. Nice touch if you ask me.

Unless you're willing to pick up everything every morning so that housekeeping can even get to the bed or into the bathroom, this isn't the place for you. While this hotel would be okay for a night or two, there's just no room to spread out and relax at all. The TV is a tiny corner unit inside a cabinet as well. I understand that no one comes to NY to stay in their room, but after a day of sightseeing and walking starting at 8 or 9 in the morning, you're ready to relax at least a couple of the nights. Also, getting a room higher up is a must if you want quiet. The disco/bar really starts to crank up the volume starting at 10:30/11:00PM and will continue through 1:30AM.

I knew from my research on TripAdvisor that the rooms would be tiny, the hallways dark, and amenities few, but figured that it would be alright for one night. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The most bothersome aspect was that I was kept awake past midnight due to excessive noise from the bar in the courtyard a dozen stories below --levels that were clearly audible with windows shut, fan turned high, and television on. I had read about this in other reviews, yet was still surprised by the extreme level. Other than the mattress, comfort was definitely lacking in my room. The safe was inconveniently located on a floor-level shelf of a cabinet, and wouldn't unlock after I had locked it. The service person I called actually scolded me for putting a laptop in there. The drinking glasses provided in the room were dirty and, therefore, unusable. The limited storage space was made even more limited as one shelf was taken up with Hudson items for sale (T-shirts, ball caps). Most seriously, both my business colleague and I noticed that the evacuation map on the back of our doors was not an accurate depiction of the floor's layout.

Before moving overseas, I was a resident of New York for just under 9 years but had never made it to the hotel bar which is very popular with the B&T crowd. While the entry way and overall design is interesting enough, the actual stay was quite unpleasant. I had booked a double for my fiance and I, non-smoking, for several nights. We were placed on the 5th floor and we would later realize it was a smoking floor. The radiator was so loud that it was as if someone was hitting our door with a metal-pipe. Having lived in NY, I know what radiators sound like, but honestly, this noise was excessively loud. We requested to change rooms after the first night and the front desk was accommodating enough. This is when the smoking-status was confirmed as the receptionist asked if we would still like a smoking room. We were then placed on the 19th floor with enough distance from the heater to avoid any noise. The rooms are extremely small. There is barely room to walk around the bed or even pass each other from the front door to the rest room. I've been in larger hotel rooms in Japan and parts of Europe, this was a surprise. If you plan on staying for more than 2 nights, I suggest staying somewhere else since we had no space to unpack or drawers to organize yourselves. I can forgive the rooms but what really made the stay at the Hudson unbearable was the horrible staff. For the most part, they are on the younger side of the spectrum and have a lot to learn in regards to service. I would say this especially for the restaurant and bar. The waiter neglected to write our order and brought us our food incorrectly, not once but twice within the one sitting. The attendance they have to actual serving is bare. They are obviously selective on who they give their attention to. The bar staff is basically the same, judging you as you walk in. Ridiculously enough, a friend that I was entertaining at the bar was asked to put his jacket back on since they have a policy of not letting jackets be draped over the chair. While my friend obliged, I could see three other tables that were not asked to do the same but looked no different to my friend. The impression they left with me was a level of immaturity that comes with inexperience and misdirected energy. I will say this. I found the reception and doormen to be very helpful during my stay.

We were pleasantly surprised to find that all of the bad comments in past reviews were all reversed. Everyone was not rude and pretentious but rather exceptionally helpful and friendly. The room was not tiny (by New York Standards) and was beautifully designed with hardwood floors and flowing white curtains, the beds were comfortalbe with European style white comforters. I think the design is that of a yacht and our room had 2 double beds and there was 5 feet between the beds and 2 feel on either side, which was more than adequate. There were no drawers for clothing, but the clothes we couldn't hang, we put on the shelf above the hanging rod near the entrance. I didn't mind as I would honestly rather have room to move around than have it taken up by a dresser. We were on the 23rd floor, the top floor below the penthouse, room #2307 and heard NO noise from the night club as indicated in previous reviews. The lobby is beautiful! It mixes nature/foliage with a gorgeous gigantic chandelier. Breakfast or lunch for 2 people without alcohol was $50 at \"The Hudson Cafeteria\", which is not a cafeteria but rather a restaurant at which you can sit inside or outside - which we chose, but I found that expensive price to be consistant with any other restaurant in New York City. The breakfast had a nice selection and lunch was good as well with garlic fries as an option. The club sandwich was good, except that the mayo used had lemon in it which was too overpowering and cancelled out the other flavors. Ask for regular mayo without lemon and it will be perfect. The former bad reviews also said that there was no express checkout and that they had to wait in line, but there is express check out now that you can either do over the phone, or they put the bill under your door the morning you leave and if you agree with it, you do not have to do anything at all, just leave. The hotel is very \"cool\" as is it's design and staff. It's so cool that the name isn't even on the outside! You'll know your hotel by a huge torch flame on the side of the building at the entrance on 58th at 9th and of course all of the taxis waiting in line to pick up guests or people waiting to get into the night club. Whole foods market is below the mall across the street and it is HUGE, and even has lots of deli and prepared foods. There is also a Starbucks as well as a Duane Reade Drug store on the same side as the Hudson. We paid $280 for our room and stayed Wednesday-Sunday.

Excited about it being a Phillip Starck/Ian Schrager concept hotel, I eagerly booked our rooms. Although I did read some reviews on another travel website, most simply remarked how small the rooms were. Well, that's just the beginning. It's fun to imagine that one must take a banana yellow glowing escalator to the huge atrium lobby that's covered with faux ivy. The lobby is quite impressive as it gives you a feel that you've entered another dimension, hip, chic and euro-styled. The front desk staff were robotic, dressed in black from head to toe. Nothing warm about them. No eye contact and not very eager to be of service to the first time guest. The music was a thumping, hip euro beat, the volume so loud that it was nearly impossible to hear the monotone voice of the clerk. We were pointed in the direction of the elevators. That's where the horror began. The lighting in the hallways was so low that one literally needed a flashlight to find their way - - not exaggerating. The elevators were playing the same euro disco music at a deafening level, too. When we arrived our designated floor 5, we landed upon a grungy carpet smelling of mildew and cigarettes. The stains on the carpet left one to imagine what could possibly be lurking in the fibers below. The hallways smelled horribly of cigarette smoke. When we opened the door to our room, I was not surprised by the decor nor the size of the room, as I had taken a virtual tour on the Hudson's website prior to our stay. I expected the room to be small, but this was ridiculous. The bed was literally a futon on the floor, you could actually trip over it if you weren't paying attention. The lighting poor here, too. Maybe stark is trendy, but not to provide proper shelf space in the bathroom for your toiletries is pathetic. They've taken minimalist to the enth degree. No place to hang your wet towel after your shower. Starck and/or Schrager has worked so hard on minimalist chic style, that they've forgotten about the guest's comfort. Or maybe they spent so much money in the lobby and bar area, that they were forced to put plastic shelving from Ikea throughout the bathroom and lightweight aluminum chairs and tables in the room. The air conditioner had a mind of it's own. Sometimes it was freezing, and other times it registered 78 degrees. The sound from the nightclub on the lobby level made it's way clear up to the 5th floor. The surly security guard stopped us as we were headed towards the elevators on Friday night around midnight. The food in the Cafeteria left much to be desired. The service throughout the entire property was absent. The robotic, self-proclaimed pretty people on staff, made one feel that you were putting them out just by offering a hello. On Saturday morning as we were leaving for the day, a maintenance employee was scattering carpet fresh powder throughout the hallways. When I asked him what he was doing, he said \"getting rid of the smell\", as if this was a daily chore. There was no turn-down service either night. I guess for $600 a night, you're on your own in that department. We were actually surprised to see that the room had been made up after we returned from our day. This morning as we were packing up, we discovered the \"required by law\" posting of their rack rate for our specific room. We were already being over charged by $20 per night. When my husband questioned the clerk at the front desk about the rack rate discovery, the clerk said abruptly \"I've NEVER seen this posted in any of our rooms. This is your charge that's on your bill.\" He was rude and abrupt. Maybe he was in a bad mood due to the obvious removal of some facial piercings gone bad. He had visible crusty scabs where a nose ring must have been and a bloody crusty scab where a post would have gone below his bottom lip. Ewwww.... Maybe that's why he was flippant. But, then again, that was the overall tone from the entire staff, from bellman all the way through the entire staff. Maybe they just don't need to do things right as the place seemed packed with Euro travelers enjoying the exchange rate. I guess they hit you hard with the lobby space then stick it to you once you enter your postage stamp size of a room. After you've entered this dark den of cigarette smoke, you should do yourself a favor and check out. We wish we had. Oh, and by the way, I asked the surly security guard about the cigarette smoking. I said \"I thought New York State was a non-smoking State\" , meaning it is illegal to smoke in a public place. He said, \"you're correct.\" Then I asked him \"well, how do you explain this thick smoke that I see in all of the shinning lights and the stench of cigarrettes throughout this place.\" He turned and walked away. Which is what I regret we didn't do when we first entered the lobby on Friday afternoon.

We booked through Hotwire - only after we paid did we find out where we were staying. Had we seen the reviews first we probably would never have stayed here, which would have been a shame. We stayed in a superior room. Yes, the room is itty bitty, but there is a small hall closet to hang a few garments & store suitcases & a small cupboard instead of a dresser with drawers; there were 3 hooks in the hall & 2 hooks in the bathroom & a rail under the sink for handtowels. There were shelves above the toilet (keep the toilet lid closed while you're working in that area or face the consequences) & a surface under the vessel sink for toiletries. In short, it's small but cleverly laid out; with a bit of creativity & humor, & by moving slowly and carefully, the room is very workable. What simply did not work was the poor but stylish lighting. Everything was dim, dull and dark - the bedroom, the bathroom, front lobby, elevators; the hallways were absolutely sepulchral, with dim green lamps above each door - very institutional and spooky. Bring your own flashlight... Customer service at the front desk was superb - warm, friendly, cheerful, helpful, genuine; seeing as this is such a trendy young person's hotel I was expecting attitude, but Sarah, Clark and Giselle were simply wonderful. The service staff was also great, coming up promptly when asked and opening a sticky window. The cleaning staff do a great job - the room was kept very clean. The bed was too low to the ground for my preference, but otherwise was very comfortable, and the duvet was comfy and cozy. Our room faced over the garden bar rather than the street, but it was pretty quiet anyway. We found a terrific diner on 57 St by 8th Ave, called the Moonrock - if you get Rosie the service is superb, otherwise can be pretty poor but the food & prices are great. There's also the Flame diner, several other restaurants and bars, & grocery stores (57th and 9th Ave) so eats can be as cheap as you like. We did not even try the Hudson's food or drinks - expensive ($5 for a 1/2 litre bottle of water in our room, v. $2.50 for a gallon bottle of Poland Springs water, $1.50 per bottle of beer at the little grocer around the corner). The location is by far the best thing about this hotel - 5 minutes to Time Warner shopping, Columbus Circle and Central Park; 20 minutes max to Times Square & the theater district. It is in a more residential area which to me was quieter (in NYC? HAH!) and nicer to stay in.

Excellent experiences at THE Hotel at Mandalay Bay in Vegas and the Hudson's sister hotel in San Fran - The Clift were sadly not repeated in NYC. Due to a delayed flight from SF we did not arrive at The Hudson until 10pm. By that time the bar had livened up - trust me, that is cool with us - but being directly adjacent to reception made the check-in experiencing a frustrating one. I asked what size of room we were in ( The Clift upgraded us to a Suite without having to ask) Our unhepful check in clerk said that it was a queen size bed, but some people felt the rooms were small ( and he honestly sniggered to himself) Once in the room it was apparent that things would be cramped - our 2 suitcases just fit in the clothing area which was one shelve ( no drawers)and 4 hangers each. The large mirrors on two walls did not gin teh illusion of space as planned. The AC unit is built into the headboard making the bed seem as if you are sleeping on a hairdryer !! The iron-board was just twice the size of my laptop. It was April ( not warm outside) but I had to turn teh fan to full and temp to 40 degrees to stop sweating when teh shower and iron were on - the room was that small that it quickly turne into a steam room. When contacted, our friendly (not!) reception said that a suite was avalable Fri-Sun and a hold would be put on for us as Thurs was fully booked. I visited reception on Friday morning to discover that no hold existed, and that they would not hold the room long enough for me to return to the room to discuss the additional $150 upgrade charge per night. We attempted to put this behind us and concentrate on teh amazing city that is NYC. We got engaged there 2 years ago and had spent every day waiting to return. A visit to the hotel bar and resturant to view our home for teh next 4 nights were met with almost contempt. The bouncer took some convincing that we were residents...I had to show my room key to gain access, and the maitre de at the resturaunt physically turned her nose up. The Hudson is in an excellent location - chosen specifically with Columbus Circle aross the road, and around teh corner from Central Park. The design is cool (however we were very disapointed that the roof terrace was closed due to being 'out of season' - although no note of this was on teh website) The whole experience is destroyed by the staff...the check-in staff are snobby, abrupt and simply rude....and not even good at there job. I asked them a question once and they took 20mins to find me on the system....we had been there for 3 days !!!!! When booking our aiport limo the concierge said they were contracted to one company (They charged $130 and could not calll my prefernce ) I had to use my cell phone to call a car ...whih only cost $99. They nicest people we met were house keeping - they at least smiled and said hello. We are well travelled and are not fussy ( this is my 1st ever hotel complaint) but the Hudson left a bad taste in our mouths. If teh trip was not prepaid we would have checked out and checked into teh Ameritania ( half the price, double the size and ten times the welcome) where we stayed previously. I would advise the Hudson management to go on a team building exercise to The Clift in SF. Now that is a hotel which proudly displays what is great and good about boutique hotels and is a true ambassador for teh Morgan's group.

Second, the room was freezing and there was no heat. It was a warm night, but the air conditioner was on when I arrived and the room was sixty degrees. The heater didn't work. I called the front desk and they promised to send up a mechanic. No mechanic arrived. By now it was midnight and I had an interview the next day. I called again, and the hotel manager got on the line. I was extremely polite, but he was rude and angry. He said that the heating system was not working because it was warm out that night and there was nothing I could do. I complained again that the room was too cold to sleep, and he said something rude and hung up on me.

I loved this hotel especially the clever design of space and light. After reading several reviews regarding the size of the rooms, I was expecting a broom cupboard! What a load of rubbish the room used all its space to the full advantage. I thought it was a clever use of space and had everything we required. I shared the room with my sister who is a fashion buyer and as you can imagine we had lots of luggage. We managed to store everything perfectly. The bathroom was compact and maybe the loo was too close to the sink so you could not be too tall or too fat! But it was fine. The staff were really friendly and the one breakfast we had was fantastic with great service. The only rude encounter we had was with a doorman on the last day who collected our bags and unfortunately we had run out of dollars to tip him. He slammed the door and was quite rude. But we thought it was funny especially the bits of tissue paper on his face where he had cut himself shaving. We always tip generously so it was unfortunate that this chap got the short straw. We had spent the day shopping and just run out of dollars. All the other staff were friendly and very helpful. There was a good mixture of ages at the hotel and it had a really lively atmosphere. Everyone seemed to really enjoy staying here. I dont think it is a young person's hotel, maybe for people who appreciate style and design and are not set in their ways. To be honest we did not make the most of the hotel because we were out and about. I think the hotel is used just as a base. The rooms encouarge people to explore. New York is such a fantastic 24/7 city we wanted to be in our room as little as possible. The location was great. We had a brilliant evening of latin jazz at the Lincoln centre just five minutes from the hotel. There is a delicious take-out Mexican two minutes away. This serves authentic Mexican. There is a traditional diner which was good for a late night coffee and snack. Blossom a really good vegetarian restaurant is also close by. It seems to be a popular hotel with New Yorkers partying at the weekends. The noise never affected us and we barely heard any from our room. The air conditioning was not at all disruptive.

This was not an easy task to do through priceline, and the only way I was able to eventually upgrade was by e-mailing the hotel management. We paid an additional $90 per room for a 300 sq. tt. deluxe double, and it was well worth it and still a bargain for the fabulous mid-town west location. Our room was certainly large enough with a bathroom that was a good size. The rooms are furnished in a european modern style. Although the TV screen was small it wasn't any problem. We enjoyed the stylish furniture with platform beds, and wood floors. The lighting was fine, and the hotel room kept very clean. We had night stands, a desk, a chair, and a safe in the room. There are no drawers for putting clothes, but they do have shelf space. There was an open closet area for hanging clothes. Yes the halls are dark, painted with gunmetal gray walls, and dark carpet. But there is a light over each hotel room entrance door, and although not particularly attractive, it is not terrible either or scary as others may have reported. The staff was helpful and pleasant.

I was very worried about some of the complaints that had been posted, especially about the size of the rooms and the attitudes of the staff \u2013 but I needn't have been. We stayed on the 23rd floor in a Deluxe room (which wasn't much more than a standard) and there was plenty of room! I could seriously have swung about 3 cats around it! Yes, I have stayed in much bigger rooms, but it was completely adequate for our needs, very clean and decked out to a high standard. People who complain about the size of the TV and the toilet need to get out more! I don't think I switched the TV on once during our 4 night stay.

First impressions were good, the Hotel lobby is a pleasant place to be, the check-in queue was efficiently managed by one of the managers and, as that morning there was a temporary problem with the lifts, she arranged for us to be taken to our rooms in the staff elevator, so far so good. Now for the rooms, they are small. The previous posts on this site are all pretty accurate, there is no room to unpack, hang clothes, leave any personal belongings lying about or do anything other than lie on the bed. The heating was two settings, \u201cFreezer and Furness\u201d, there is no happy medium and sometimes only the Furnace setting worked, we had to leave our window open one night which didn\u2019t help with the noise issue (see later). The rooms and bathroom felt very claustrophobic. The walls between the rooms aren\u2019t the thickest and we were on the 17th floor and could still hear the street noise from below. In addition to all of this a $30 charge has been made to our credit card, despite querying this at the time with the hotel and being assured that this charge was made in error and would be removed. However, I feel everything needs to be viewed subjectively, you don\u2019t go to New York to spend a huge amount of time in your hotel room if you are then you\u2019re heading to the wrong city. The location is pretty dam good, a 2 min walk and you are in Central Park, with a subway station on your way, 5mins \u2013 10mins and you are in Time Square, four blocks straight over and you arrive at the top of 5th Avenue and Tiffany\u2019s.

Drafts everywhere in the hotel (think NASA wind tunnel). From the front door to the escalator to the front desk the wind was very stong. 2. Uneven temperature throughout the building. Some areas like the front desk (where they had to put up heaters behind the counter to keep the front desk stuff from freezing) were really cold, others were too warm. 3. Rooms are super small with about 1' of space between the endge of bed and walls and beds are REALLY small. I am 6'2\" and the so called \"king\" bed was about 1' short for me. Also, the bathroom's size was so small I can't really find the right words to describe it. I felt caged there. 4. Windows in the room were not sealed properly and as a result there was a BIG draft onto the bed (yes, we had to slip in a reverse position, it was too late to change rooms and judging from other reviews other rooms had the same problem). Actually, it was the first hotel I saw anywhere in the world where bed's head is against the window. 5. Hotel is very dark (think Medieval castle) and stuff were not very friendly. We waited about 10 min for a host to seat us for a late nite cup at around midnight, and he/she never showed up, others pretended they did not notice us. At breakfast, our waiter was more concerned with us paying the bill then good service (yes, we did pay eventually -))). 5. Ah, yes... the toilet...when I flushed it... Well, it just filled up. Being fair to the engineering stuff, they fixed that problem promptly, but it was a bit too late for us anyway. We already decided to run away. 6. At check out, the front desk gave us the bill for somebody else. With full name, address details, etc. Think identity theft. On balance, our one nite stay was terrible. Some here say that the hotel makes you feel young. True, the night club is VIBRANT. But one does not have to stay in the hotel to enjoy nite life there.

Actually, a coffin suggests silence, but a room at the Hudson is anything but. Needless to stay, after a long day working in the city, I did not look forward to returning to my accommodations. [2] The Bar Rocks The bar at the Hudson Hotel is pure fantasy. The illuminated floor panels, the renaissance-like painting on the ceiling and eccentric mix of lounge furniture create an atmosphere entirely worthy of the New York scene. Also take a look at the library. Pick out a book and sink down into one of those plush leather chairs by the fireplace.

The bathroom is definiately interesting with the transparent wall between it and the bedroom, but that keeps the tiny room from being too clausterphobic.

Perhaps we were lucky, but we never heard a peep from the other rooms. Elevators were quick, security was great (checking key cards at night to make sure the only people getting into elevators were guests or were with guests). The only draw back would be the service in the \"yellow\" bar and the volume on the music in the bar, lobby and elevators. Definitely club style...loud and techno-ish. Our waitress at the bar was pretty stupid not to stay on top of us...we were prepared to have a few drinks and wound up leaving after one. About 30 minutes later, we went out to get drinks elsewhere and saw our empty glasses still sitting on the table by the couch were we lounged. The Hudson's location is fantastic. Down the street from Columbus Circle, there are plenty of inexpensive food options within one block. Check out the nice Whole Foods in the bottom of the Columbus Circle mall if you want a quick bite (don't go after 5, when lines get long). Times Square is just a few blocks away. For great pizza, go left out the door and go down 8th Ave a few blocks to Sacco's. The atmosphere is nil, but the pizza is great.

Great weekend but the Hudson was AWFUL -- the biggest disappointment in a very rich travel life. For almost $500 per night, we got a tiny room with no bathtub and a dark non-view of the courtyard. A former New Yorker had recommended the Hudson based on the chic lobby and bar, which is all you should bother seeing. For all the vaunted design touches, they all-too-often fail in the function department. The funky lamps in our room were too dim to illuminate a space only four feet wider than the bed. In the equally dim elevators, the floor numbers are brass on brass and people had to get down and squint to see which button to push. Our room had no dresser -- just an inconveniently high cubby hole from which you had to pull down all the items to find the one you wanted. Also, the air in our room was painfully dry -- like being on an airplane -- so much so that my upper lip swelled up! My sister spent similar cash at the Tribeca Grand this fall and her experience was much, much better. Go to the Hudson to look around the eye-catching lobby, buy an over-priced cocktail in the bar so you can scan for stars, then go somewhere with value for money to rest your head for the night.

When you're tired of the club scene, or just want to refresh, you go to your room, and it is quiet. Let me talk about the rooms. Yes, they are small, but they are very nice and cozy, in a smart, artful way. The only thing that detracts from this hip sort of environment is the dirt-cheap electronics....an tiny, aged tv and a Walmart clock. Everything else is great. The rooms are small, I must emphasize, but that's not the point. The point is that they are quite smartly designed, really different. Now, about price: here's my best tip: go to Hotwire. This is the only upper west hotel that has 3.5 stars. So, if it is available, you'll probably pay $200, not $500. This hotel is not worth 4 or 500. I hope I've helped.

They refused, and said I needed to carry them downstairs myself to hand them to the doorman who would deliver them to my room when I returned, which seemed unhelpful and an unnecessary hassle. An important (but unexpected) fax arrived before I checked in, but I wasn't told about this when I checked in, it wasn't delivered to my room, and there was no message left for me on my phone. Perhaps I was supposed to guess that I had a fax waiting for me. When I discovered it was there (2 days later) they refused to bring it to my room and I had to come to the lobby to get it myself.

While we had taken note of the fact that the rooms were small, we figured since we only wanted somewhere to sleep and shower, we'd be ok. As others have mentioned, the common areas of the hotel are so dimly lit as to be uncomfortable, and have sufficiently loud music in the evenings as to render comfortable conversation impossible. The bathrooms are so small as to be almost dangerous. The water out of basins in some bedrooms comes out brown (my sister complained and was told that this was a hotel-wide problem so there was no point in switching rooms - the problem did clear up the following day). On three out of the four days I was there, the shower was tepid despite running it for a while. The bottled water in the room costs $6.50!! Thank goodness for the CVS across the street where you can buy it for $1.57. All of these problems were irritating but liveable with. The REAL annoyance however, are the staff. It seems to be a condition of employment that you think you are are astonishingly rude. Once I found the concierge to be helpful but otherwise, the service was extremely irritating. For instance, I asked for something small to be mailed within Manhattan and was told that as the packaging clerk didn't come in until 10am my only option was Fedex. No flexibility and no customer service. And whatever you do, don't leave anything at the hotel. Trying to get it back is almost impossible!

When we arrived at 9pm we were told that the guests before us hadn't checked-out so we would be \"downgraded\" several categories and a room with two double beds was all that was available. The desk clerk offered us drink coupons and free breakfast as an apology. After 30 minutes of frustration with an unsympathetic manager named Kye they \"found\" a room with a queen bed. When we went upstairs and opened the door we found two blowers in the room and the housekeeper informed us it had been painted that day. The front desk informed us that was the best they could do. Nothing like sleeping surrounded by paint fumes. We woke up with headaches but tried to make the best of it. After an afternoon of shopping we called downstairs and the desk clerk said a bellman would be right up to get our luggage and move us into our originally reserved room. Thirty minutes went by and no one came. I went downstairs, cut to the front of the line and demanded keys to the new room.

Ok, I have stayed in many hotels around the world and a hotel in Amsterdam was holding our record for being small but the Hudson takes the award by a mile! It was tiny! Now again we did look into the hotel before booking it so we knew it would be small but you really dont get a feel for the size of the room until you get in there. It is a room \"not\" to stay in for any lenght of time, just to sleep, shower and store your bags nothing else. The interesting and unusual \"window\" beside the bath/shower looking onto the bed took a bit of getting use to. If your'e into exhibitionism then by all means keep the curtain open so your partner can see you shower as they relax on the bed! The space provided for the TV, CD player, safe etc does what its supposed to \"store out of sight\". Dont go near the sweets or water left for you as even the small bottle of water left on the table was $6.

The rooms were exactly as described to us, average size for NY, a remarkable good use of space, a sharp design and amenities that met all of our needs. If you blink you will miss this hotel, it is a 5 minute walk to Columbus Circle itself and the CC subway stop. Keep walking and find the south end of Central Park, Times Square and the Met. Right outside the door is a great little deli with everything from soup to nuts. This came in handy as there is no food/coffee served in the hotel except for premium items ordered though room service. As my friend put it, \"at night, this hotel turns int o a nightclub\" . It does. The entryway off 58th St is only recognizable by a bright stream of neon green light that spills onto the sidewalk. Go up the escalator and your greeted by a vine covered ,glass atrium & sprawling, wood planked front desk. Here, you can check in and/or take your pick of places to enjoy a cocktail.

By the way, if you are going to New York city and don't know that it is expensive, then go to someplace like Missouri or Arkansas and go to Times Square with the rest of the tourists. P.S. It was also very refreshing to see that the pictures of the hotel on its website are real!

The only thing this place had going for it was the location. I sent a letter to the hotel detailing my complaints (via email & USPS) and to date have received no reply. Below is a detailed description of my experience. I would just add that my fellow business colleagues staying in the same hotel were equally appalled and we all have no plans to ever return. 1.On the evening of the first night of my stay, I invited a few friends to my room. In person, I asked the concierge to arrange for six glasses to be brought to the room. When the glasses had not arrived 30 minutes later, and a call to room-service had gone unanswered, I went back down to the reception desk. The receptionist said the concierge had left for the evening but that he would take care of the matter himself. Twenty more minutes passed and still no glasses arrived so I again went to the same person at the reception desk to inquire. This person\u2019s reaction was to inform me that he had already called housekeeping to ask for the glasses (rather than, say, apologizing for the delay and working to rectify the matter). When I told him that despite his call no glasses had arrived, so perhaps he should do something further, he promised to call again. When the glasses had not arrived 20 minutes later (yes, this is now over an hour after my first request), I went to the library bar and fetched some glasses myself. The glasses from housekeeping never arrived. 2.Later the same night, a security guard knocked on the door and informed me of \u201cnumerous noise complaints\u201d related to my gathering. In a rather aggressive manner\u2014and prior to giving me a chance to respond\u2014he proceeded to outline the dire consequences should the noise level not go down. First, I pity those who had to launch \u201cnumerous complaints\u201d before I was informed of the problem\u2014from their point of view, that can not seem to have been responsive. Second, I had no intention of disturbing anyone and indeed there was no threatened second visit (although, given the apparent dysfunction of the hotel, that may have been for other reasons!). 3.Neither our guests that night, nor I, were particularly impressed with the interior of the room where, for example, the floorboards were literally coming apart at the seams and some were even lifted from the floor. The shelves in the bathroom were coming out of the wall and had to be pushed back in, and in addition the room fan was quite loud. 4.I had two computers, one personal and one for business, so I called the desk to ask if the charge for Internet service was per room or per computer and were told it was per room. The next day when I needed to use the two computers, I found this information was incorrect. The receptionist said she would put a note in our account such that we would only be charged once for that day. Despite this promise, upon checkout there were two charges which I then had to spend time at the front desk correcting. 5.Upon checkout, I arranged for late departure for my husband who was travelling with me. Despite this, and in contravention to a \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign, someone knocked on the door at around 10 am and kept at it until it was answered. When my husband pointed out that late departure had been arranged, that regular checkout time had not come, and there was a no disturbance request on the door, the woman who knocked responded that guests sometimes forgot to remove the sign upon leaving. It did not seem to dawn on the person that an apology was in order. 6.On the day I arrived I left a message for a colleague with the concierge. She verified that the guest was in the hotel, and took the written message (in an envelope with his name on the front) from me. My colleague received this message upon checkout 2 days later! This is simply unacceptable. 7.It seemed sadly consistent with my experience at the hotel that the vending machines on my floor were out of order when I arrived and remained so for the duration of my stay. In sum, the hotel seems to be in a state of disrepair with little communication between the employees and even less commitment to making guests feel comfortable. Both as a business traveler and as a frequent traveler, I know that I will not stay at that hotel again or recommend it to anyone else or to others at my company.", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New England", "Title": "\u201cA Bad Acid Trip\u201d", "Author": "No_Name20L", "ReviewID": "UR5410989", "Content": "The decorators must have been on a bad acid trip when they did the interior design of this hotel.

Yes the rooms are very small and we knew this as we'd stayed before in 2002. What we didn't know was that a \"superior\" queen room was barely bigger than a standard. Still, as some of the other reviewers have said this is a boutique hotel and you don't go to NY to spend hours in your hotel room.That said, the rooms are not intelligently designed and space is wasted. The air-con is indeed noisy, it wasn't a massive problem to us but light sleepers beware! On to the public spaces. Very impressive, but remember you don't need to be staying at the hotel to enjoy them and you may feel as a guest that you are largely paying to maintain these spaces for the benefit of all. The cashing of travellers cheques seems to be a real issue for the Hudson. We found they were unwilling to deal with more than $200 at any time. Even worse, at 7.45pm on the Saturday night of our stay we were told they had no facility to cash us $100. We actually had to complain and make a nuisance of ourselves in order to make it happen and it eventually did happen. This tells me that it wasn't a case of \"can't\", it was a case of \"can't be bothered\". This is a standard hotel service the world over, you shouldn't be forced to demand it. I don't blame the reception staff for this as it appeared to be a management failing (or possibly hotel policy?). I said I was determined to be upbeat so I will finish on a high note.

One-star?? The place has style coming out of its orifices, from the bronze-cast elevator walls to the sumptuously ivied lobby, and this diversion from typical chintzy hotel decor alone earns it a couple of pips as far as I am concerned. But the Hudson is better than that. People complain about the size of the rooms. Why? When we booked online we were told that our room was 150 sq. ft. (that's a standard room with queen size bed, a few dollars a night more expensive than the smallest option, 144 sq. ft.). That's 15 ft x 10 ft, which is plenty big, and we used our room a lot during our stay without ever feeling crushed or crowded. Indeed, the room was an archetype of excellent design, by which I don't just mean the stylish details (though they were nice) but also the ability to make the most of the space. Four bedside tables, a writing desk and chair, open clothes hanger and shelf behind the dividing curtain you see in my photos (the ensuite is back there too), and a concealed cupboard with safe, mini-bar, shelves for personal items, TV and stereo seem an almost miraculous achievement. The staff were helpful and friendly with only a couple of exceptions - on our last morning, the housekeeper knocked on our door twice to ask us if we had checked out yet, which felt like pressure on us to get moving before the allowed time, and the desk clerk on checkout seemed less than pleased by our desire to split payment of the account between cash and cards. But these were minor matters: otherwise everyone was wonderfully polite, friendly and helpful. On arrival, the doorman had our cases out of the trunk almost before we were out of the cab, and when we left for the evening, they had a cab with us instantly; room service were wonderful on the phone and in person, and the desk staff were helpful with directions and local advice. And if much of this charm was brought on by the desire for a tip, then that doesn't set them apart from any other service professionals in New York. And if it's a deal-maker, you may be pleased to know also that the staff, male and female, seem exclusively recruited from the ranks of retired Abercrombie and Fitch models. Our one major disappointment with the Hudson was that the much-vaunted Sky Terrace on the 15th floor is currently closed for renovations. This isn't mentioned on the website or in their room welcome pack, and indeed I see the tripadvisor pic for the Hudson shows the terrace: so don't get your hopes up. This was disappointing particularly because the hotel otherwise is such an all-encompassing experience - from the luxurious library with pool table, through the private park on the second floor to the ultra-hip bar where the beautiful people gather each night - that we found ourselves using the hotel as much more than just a crash-pad at night. All in all, the Hudson is a superb choice for young(ish) visitors who like a bit of style where they're staying. Its location adjacent to Central Park is superb, and if you don't fancy paying for room service, there's a Starbucks on W 58th Street (turn right out of the hotel entrance), and a wonderful Whole Foods Market in the basement of the Time Warner Centre at the end of the street. Having said that, the room service food is better than any I have tasted, and the 'Cafeteria' restaurant within the hotel is pricey but superb.", "Date": "April 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThe Hudson ain't no HoJo\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4986674", "Content": "So, if you expect HoJo - go to one!

I've read some complaining about the in-room snacks, etc. There is a CVS drugstore across the street and a WHOLE FOODS in the Time Warner bldg across the street as well...easy to get your own room snacks. We never ate there with so much nearby. Just a couple of martinis in the bar ($14 each). As far as the soundproofing goes - the a/c unit actually acted as white noise (and was not clunky as some ppl have mentioned) and we slept just fine. No issues with hot water. it was always there. The bathroom is tiny (I really do agree with ppl who said it would be difficult to use if you were tall and/or very obese) and there is a glass partion (which u can seal off visually w/ the shower curtain) btwn the bathroom and bed. But - it's white, so you can still see vague shadows, if you're squishy about those kinda things. The smell everyone keeps talking about? YES. It exists. On one of the lower floors (not room floors...a reception hall area or something that is not high-traffic or used by guests). Our elevator opened on this floor accidentally and we got a big ol' whiff of sewer. Mm mm good. Fortunately, it wasn't in our room or the lobby or anywhere else. Just be forewarned: there is a sewer floor. hah! The bar is fun (80s/90s music) and a hangout for local New Yorkers as well. So, if you're looking for nightlife...it's downstairs! We actually got our room for $50/night due to a system error on their website. So, we had 3 nights in NYC for $180 total cuz someone on the website screwed up. Maybe if we had paid regular fare, we wouldn't be so forgiving. STILL...what we needed was there. This place is not for kids and not for middle age, quiet types who want in-room snacks and a big ol' TV. You're in New York! Plenty is at your fingertips. It's small, clean, modern facility.

We really did not belive them and have them change the sheets. It really did not help! Than we found out that the hotel did not have a good ventilation system and it was smelling all over the place! We also could hear everthing the next door was doing, even when they rolled the toilet paper we were hearring! Everytime we moved in the bed, the bed squeaked like a dormatory room.

The week before last was my second stay at this hotel and will not be my last. I actually work in the hotel industry and I have got to say that I have rarely encountered service that was this exceptional. Upon arriving at the hotel, I realized that I had left my laptop case (inside was my laptop, day planner, schedule, wallet and credit cards) in the taxi. In about three seconds, a routine business trip turned into a nightmare. I went to the front desk to check in and, of course, was in quite a bind since I had no credit cards with me and only about $200 in cash. Chelsea, the front desk agent, felt the wrath of my stress and frustration when I, admittedly, was quite rude and unfriendly. She responded to my bad attitude with understanding, politeness and a genuinely helpful demeanor. She then introduced me to her manager, Don Cheatham. Don, like Chelsea, was an unbelievable help. They were able to get me checked in without the card, and suggested that the concierge might be able to help get my laptop case back by calling the number on the receipt for the cab. This was how I met the head concierge who's name, I think, was James. From, calling the cab company and tracking down my case (which was returned to me that night without a thing missing) to, then helping me find an obscure power cord for my computer by calling several places, to showing me how to get from Midtown to Kennedy in 40 minutes at Rush Hour for $7.... the head concierge is one of the most resourceful and pleasant concierge I have ever encountered. The night of my check-in fiasco, after I had gotten settled in, I got a knock at the door and was blown away when I answered the door to see a bottle of wine and a handwritted card being delivered to me with regrets that my trip had started off badly and wishes for a pleasant stay. Thanks, in large part to the Hudson staff, the rest of my trip was great. I can't understand how so many people can complain about the level of service at this hotel. Some of the other common complaints, are somewhat valid. The rooms are very small and the hallways are dark. But, this hotel is not for everyone.

The Husdon hotel promised a funky, trendy atmosphere to fit our urban lifestyle, so we thought it was a perfect fit. Until we arrived. Yes, the entrance and lobby is impressive as is the lounge. Sipping martinis at the bar with the trendy 20-something crowd around us dressed in Gucci and Prada from head to toe was something reminiscent of a Sex and the City episode. The food at the Cafeteria was great although the service wasn't. We arrived on New Year's Eve and for a mere $500.00 US per night, we were stashed in a room with barely enough space to fit the two of us and our 3 pieces of luggage. The scent of bleach was disturbingly overwhelming, although that could be interpreted as a reassuring sign of cleanliness. After settling in, we discovered deficiencies in the room that costed us the night's sleep. I brought the issue (a malfunctioning and very noisy heater and nonfunctioning lights) to the attention of a doding front desk employee the next morning who prompty directed us to another room at a marginally cheaper rate. Gladly, we accepted the alternative except the room we were moved to was smaller (if you can imagine that) with a bubbling wood floor, risking our balance and splinters everytime we moved about the room. We had also been promised champagne and strawberries in the first room as part of an upgrade by a member of the staff as well as an American Express customer service representative who confirmed the arrangement but these never arrived either. When we finally checked out and brought up the issues again, the front desk clerk basically said in no uncertain terms that I should temper my expectations for a hotel that has been retrofitted to a one hundred and something year old YMCA building. They simply thanked us for our business and welcomed us back very soon. I paid the bill but would never stay there again nor recommend it to anyone. Not only did we pay an excuberant sum of money - some 25% more than market value because of the holidays - for less than mediocre accommodations but the hotel did not deliver on any of its promises nor did it offer any conclusive and reasonable solutions.

I'm sure the bars are great. It's the rooms that suck. From what I understand, this was a women's dormitory or something before the Morgans Hotel Group turned it into a hotel. They didn't put a lot of effort into renovating the dorms into hotel rooms. The rooms are smaller than a typical train compartment (the hotel prefers to say they're \"reminiscent of a private cabin on an upscale yacht.\" More like a fishing trawler). The wobbly steel writing desk, which is about the width of a Time Magazine, and matching steel chair, harder on the ass than a bus bench, appear to have been stripped from a prison cell. Actually, a prison cell is more sensibly designed than this room. No amount of dark woods, mirrors, and pin-point halogens can hide the fact that this room is the size of a Camry. The room is slightly wider than the low, Queen-size bed that dominates the space. The space can barely accomodate one average-sized person. The bathroom has plexiglass walls, which are covered with a thin, transparent curtain. So if you like privacy while you're on the toilet, forget about it. If you do sit on the toilet, your knees will hit the wall and you'll think back fondly on the spacious lavatory on the plane. There isn't a single drawer in the room, just an open \"closet\" in front of the door that isn't large enough to fit a suitcase and that only has three hangers. There are no ice bucket in the room because there's no space for one. The tiny TV set is in a narrow cupboard, gets no reception, and makes my laptop screen seem huge. The heater gurgles and whines (even when its off), has two settings (freezing cold and blisteringly hot) and is conveniently located behind the headboard.

We stayed for two nights at $205/night but with all the taxes it ended up costing something like $475 for two nights. Don't expect charm. You enter the front glass doors and immediately ride up an escalator to a dimly lit reservation desk area with booming music playing to make it seem trendy, which I suppose it is. The bar is popular and although we tried to go in Fri. night, we were turned away because we didn't have a reservation!(for the bar) The ceiling in the bar (visible from the escalator)is artfully painted. The lighting is so dim in the hotel that near the elevators I could hardly see. We stayed in a \"standard room\" on the 12th floor. The hallway walls are all painted a very dark industrial gray, and the carpeting is also very dark. As stated in another review, the only lighting is small fluorescent lights above the door numbers. The room is teeny tiny with room enough for our queensized bed. It's true that the room was either too hot or too cold. The heating does make banging noises when it comes on, and the windows allow cold air to come into the room. And we could hear so much noise outside that we slept fitfully both nights. The bathroom is interesting...The sink is one of those modern ones that feels awkward to use somehow. A mere 8\" away is the toilet and about 10\" from there is the small tub. The wall inside the tub/shower is glass giving you a great view of the bedroom and vice versa! There is a thin curtain you can pull to afford yourself some privacy, but nonetheless if bathroom privacy is important to you (and it is to many women) forget this place!

We had a late check in and was at first confused by the facade. The picture on the web site was obviously taken when the hotel was just opened. The front of the building was dirty, most of the yellow lighting that looked so cool on the website was burnt out and the obvious was no sign...and some \"ratty\" potted trees. After a bit of confusion we made our way up to the front desk (again no signs or direction)Check-in was fairly quick, however the attitude was unbelieveable ...sorry to bother your conversation! As an interior designer the lobby and bar was impressive however once we arrived on our floor(17th)we faced west, it was a different story. It's obvious that the dark paint and carpet was to cover up the lack of repairs that was required to convert this building to a hotel properly. Very poorly lit halls and \"trendy\" lights above doors (many needed repairs)was disappointing even before we got to our room. The room was as it looked on the website, however only after 10-15 min of being in the room and unpacking, you soon realize the lack of planning to actually live in this thing for a few days. A lack of hangers, no drawers to keep things in, a very small unpractical desk and metal chair and really no where to put your stuff(unless to travel only with a backpack). I thought the bathroom was interesting however the commercial pressure toilet was extreamly noisy and there was a lack of space to put things on and no where to put things in. It was also obvious that the upkeep of furnishing in this hotel is not important. I found mould in the bathroom, a broken floor lamp, a broken snack/mini bar drawer, engineered flooring that required repair or replacement, peeling paint and dusty furniture. I'm not sure when the metal shelf in the corner of the bathroom was cleaned but not before we arrived. My worst horror was trying to find the ice machine. I called to ask and was told that there was one on each floor...after looking again I called back to the front desk and asked again...oh ya! there is not one on 17...but every other floor has one...I decided to take the stairs up to the 18th floor...ahhhh its not part of the hotel as I soon discovered. After passing a wierd man on the stairs smoking pot I came to the 18th floor which looked like a movie set of old project housing. The carpet is dirty, the doors are old and damaged, I won't even go into the hallways except to say that I would never take the stairs again...After going back to my floor I was seriously concerned about our safty and wondered if the entire building was the hotel or just a few floors. The heating was terrible and we were either too cold or too hot. The pipes banged all night and there was a constant breeze comming from the window which is right over your head. The nail in the coffin was check out. We checked out at 6am to catch our train back to Canada. We decided to use our extra US travellers cheques to pay for the room but was told by the front desk that the float/till/cash..whatever was not there until 7am. What crap! We were forced to pay by Visa which after the exchange to Canadian and having to cash in our extra travellers cheques when we returned gave us a loss in exchange rates of over $ 65 CAN combined. What kind of service are they running! I would suggest staying clear of this hotel and its affilitates. It's obvious that hospitality is there second concern. ps: I think I left my yogurt in the window to keep cold as again...the room lacked a frige, mini bar...or even a simple coffee maker.

Its amazing what $50 more a night can get you! The Hudson is the second worst hotel I have ever stayed at - only beaten by the Hotel Pennsylvania (believe the reviews - its awful). Although the Hudson isn't really a bad hotel I hated it. My girlfriend and I booked through priceline and upon reading the reviews were a little worried. However, we came to the conclusion that 'most hotel rooms in New York are small' (my suite at the Merdian wasn't) and 'at least the reviews say its clean' (whereas the Pennsylvania was outrageously dirty and smelled). Our room at the Hudson was very clean but nothing had prepared us for quite small the room was. We had to shove the bed to one side to be able to fit our suitcase on the floor. There was very little storage. We asked if we could move to a bigger room but were told there were none available. After the initial shock wore off we weren't too bothered with the size of the room (it is New York City after all) but we had other issues with the hotel. First off, the staff (in the lobby and at the door) were rude. They may be saying 'Welcome to the Hudson' but they are thinking 'I'm cooler than you' (They weren't). Secondly, we are a young couple and the attempts to make the Hudson a 'cool hangout' didn't work for us at all. Most guests (including ourselves) seemed uneasy with the loud music that is played continuously and nightclub-esque lit lobby. The music played late into the night and could be heard from our room. We asked to move to a room on the other side of the hotel but apparently none were available. (I just think the staff were too cool to allow us to move rooms). The concierge at the Parker Meridian had been extremely helpful and pointed out some great restaurants off the beaten track. The concierge at the Hudson made me feel rude for asking if they knew of a good Italian (they didn't). I could go on...but at the end of the day, when you are in New York there is so much to do who cares if your hotel looks good and is described in guide books as uber chic? You just want to be able to come back to a hotel with friendly staff and clean rooms after a good days gallivanting and have a rest . We were able to return to a clean room however we couldn't relax. The incessant music drove us crazy to the point of staying out of the hotel as much as possible - the hotel bar is in a courtyard and if your room backs onto this courtyard (even if you are on a highlevel) all you can hear is club music until about 12 each week night.

But I think you'll also learn that no New Yorker in his right mind would stay at the hotel. We got our first negative vibe at the front desk where the girl checking us into our room could not have been any less friendly -- a single smile would have been alright. Then came the rooms. During my stay of 5 nights, we (a friend and I) had two rooms -- one with a single queen bed and a deluxe room with 2 double beds. (We couldn't get the deluxe room until our 2nd night). The room with the single queen bed was disgraceful. The floors themselves are nice wood floors and the bed is comfortable with nice linens. However, there is no dresser or anywhere else to put clothes, other than a shelf-less closet for shirts and pants. The television is tiny. Also, there was only about 1-2 feet on each side of the bed and only a few feet in front of the bed -- it was like living in a closet. If you want a room for anything BUT sleep, you are going to pull your hair out in this place. The room with two beds (a deluxe room that was much more expensive) was considerably larger, yet small even by New York standards. The amenities were the same -- no dresser. Where do they expect you to put your clothes? In both rooms, the bathrooms are incredibly small. Worse yet, on the Saturday morning of our stay, the entire hotel had no hot water until early afternoon. The water was ice cold making for one great shower.

Of course, we also found it very difficult to get onto an elevator. Even though there are several elevators, it seemed as if few were working, you'd always wait several minutes for one, and when it finally arrived, it was already full. After a couple occasions of watching 2-3 full down-elevators pass us by, we finally took to riding the elevator up just to ensure getting a ride down -- some stay! Waiting minutes for elevators happened every single day. Overall, I was very disappointed with this hotel and would not stay there again.

The first room I was given had what appeared to be mold damage to the ceiling. I went back down to the lobby and was immediately given another room of the same size. They were perfectly polite and quick about switching me. Anyway, I found the regular-sized room I had to be perfectly adequate. There isn't a lot of space, but with the alcove by the entry there is definitely enough room for shoes, coats, and suitcases. The desk and the bedside tables also provide enough space to put down books or small bags. Also, unlike other reviewers, I found that there is plenty of space to move around the bed, maybe three feet all around. The space is really used very efficiently with the TV and some other knickknacks tucked away into a small closet next to the desk. The bathrooms are not large, but again, perfectly all right.

Not as much street noise, but the air conditioner was so rattlely that we had to sleep with it off- in July.

My mistake was that I ironed before the shower and turning on the iron completely blew the power in the room, including the air conditioner (and I think a good portion of the Bronx). Suddenly, the temperature began rising exponentially as I frantically called the front desk. They told me that someone would be right up (which they were not) and after a second call, I decided to bail out again sweaty and showerless and hope for the best later. I returned well after 10pm and although it still was not cool in the room, at least the power was restored. Three cheers for housekeeping! Although I did have thoughts of returning back to my home across the river that night, I stuck it out. Did I mention that this was one of the worst nights sleep that I've ever had!!! I called the front desk the first thing in the morning to inform them that I was checking out because of the conditions and they did offer me another room (how generous) however when I inquired if they had any better bedding (which was right on par with Motel 6) the hotel rep said in a somewhat defensive voice \"what's wrong with the bedding\".

Yes, the room is small, but it's cute. You walk in the non labeled hotel and go up a yellow light escalator to the lobby.

You arrive at your floor, take a narrow dimly light hallway to your room. The dim lights are above the doors to the rooms. I have seen even more dimmer lights though. In my room you walked in. It was basically a square. You walk in and there's a smaller hallway to the bed but if you make a direct left is the tiny bathroom. My bathroom had a sink bowl, very modern, and a light that was light around the mirror. A faucet was extended over the bowl from the wall, from what I recall. There were shelves above the toilet (next to the sink) to put stuff that might usually go on a sink counter. There was a small space below the sink for the soapdish. The bathroom also had bathtub with curtain liners on both sides as the side towards the bedroom was a glass wall. I wasn't sure if it was for privacy or wasn't waterproof, thus the need for the liner. The bedroom was cute with a backlight headboard and two painted lightboxes on each side of the bed and a small table on each side of the bed with an alarm clock on one side. There was a tiny desk at the end of the bed in front of the shower glass I previously mentioned. I could read by the light easily. A tassle hanging from the headboard was the on/off switch for the backlight. I believe it was a fluorescent bar of light. I stayed on the 15th Floor. The view of the Hudson River from the 15th Floor outdoor deck was nice. It's a 22/23 floor building. Yes, there were a few people in front of me in line each time I came to the front desk. At 11pm I came down and asked the woman at the desk if there was somewhere to store my luggage the next day when I was touring, and felt comfortable asking her if I should tip him. She was sweet and she said she has had similar questions in the past as well herself. It was weird being called sir by the man who held by bags in storage and brought them back out for me.

For those of you not familiar with it, the Hudson is the modern, minimalist hip hotel offering micro-sized rooms in a fantastic Upper West Side location. I remember thinking the service was somewhat impersonal the last time I was here, but this time around everyone seemed friendly and willing to help. The rooms are tiny. The hotel says they are \u201cmodeled on a cruise ship cabin\u201d and they ain\u2019t kidding. Still, the design of the rooms is very interesting. The bathroom was tiny and yet looked modern and the hotel supplied high quality amenities. The bed was comfortable and fitted with high quality linens. And in the hotel\u2019s defense, my girlfriend didn\u2019t think the rooms were as small as I did. Like a lot of \u201chip\u201d hotels, the Hudson is dark. Everyone looks better in dark, indirect lighting, and so does everything. Including hotel hallways and furnishings. It did not escape our notice that the hotel covers up some blemishes with dark lighting. Still, it works and it didn\u2019t bother us. Or I should say I didn\u2019t mind it. I think my girlfriend thought they should brighten things up a little. The lobby and bar downstairs is not to be missed if for no other reason than the fact that they have some wonderful people-watching. We spent a couple hours gawking at the hipsters and drinking the only moderately overpriced martinis in the fairly crowded watering hole. The place was busy and we were there on a random Tuesday night. There are times when the hotel seems a bit much. In the morning I felt like searching the hallways for the light switch \u2013 no need to keep it so dark at 8:00 AM. And the hotel posts a bouncer by the elevators, ostensibly to keep bar guests from wandering upstairs, but it seemed a bit affected. And the hotel has no signage outside which makes it seem like it\u2019s trying a bit too hard. Still, I like the Hudson. I maintain it\u2019s one of the best bargains in New York (we paid a paltry $160 - a corporate rate - for a night in a prime New York location). I challenge anyone to find a better value. The small size of the rooms can feel a little claustrophobic, but the Hudson isn\u2019t for people who want to spend lots of time in their rooms.

I was not familiar with the hotel so I immediately went to TripAdvisor for some info. After reading the reviews, I was very worried that we would hate it. At least the TripAdvisor info prepared me for how small the rooms were or I would have thought someone was playing a joke on us when we opened the door to our room. It was so ridiculously small that it seemed funny to us, and that gave us a lighthearted approach to our stay. We didn't plan on spending much time in the room and they fortunately were able to squeeze a bed in it. You're basically talking about a room with a queen size bed and just enough room to squeeze around it...providing you don't set a suitcase on the floor. From a design standpoint, the Hudson is obviously going for a cool/chic/trendy approach; however, it is done in a very eclectic way. Overall, we liked the feel of the lobby and public areas which were a mix of cool lighting effects and a dark lodge-like decor. The Library room has a pool table surrounded by comfy couches and chairs, and was a nice place to wind down at the end of the day. The outdoor courtyard area was open but a little too chili for us to sit outside. It did appear to be a pretty cool setting however. We did also have dinner one night at the hotel restaurant and we both liked our meal. Overall, the one thing I can say about the Hudson is that it is unique. The design is truly eclectic and probably much more likely to appeal to the younger crowd. Although the room was ridiculously small (and noisy at night), I didn't hate it; I was almost amused by it. It did have some cool night lights but the 13\" TV was a big disappointment. If they would put small plasma TVs in the rooms, it might be just enough of a cool factor to forgive the fact that there's only about 8\" between the front of the toilet seat and the wall. The bed was fine but not up to the new standards that many of the better hotels have upgraded to. When the bed \"is the room\", you should give the customer a great bed and a plasma TV to truly qualify as a chic hotel. The location is fairly good, just a block west of the AOL towers on 58th where there is a nicer subway stop. If you don't care for the trendy/eclectic design of this hotel you'll probably hate it.

I was expecting something a little more chic. Inside it was decorated nice but dark. I felt like I was at a nightclub all the time. The rooms are extremly small. both my daughter and I are slim and petite, and we still bumped into each other. The rooms were also very dark; it was hard to put your make-up on. There weren't any dresser drawers or any place to put your underclothes. We pretty much had to live out of our suitcase. They did,howerver, provide you with a small closet. Showering was another whole exprience. The shower is small and has curtains on both sides of you, so everytime I moved around the curtains would stick to my skin. The bathroom was very small I could almost touch the wall in front of me with my face and knees. I wondered if it was code compliance? If you are a large person, you better think twice. In the bathroom there was now place to do your hair. The decor in the room was Akia style (Sweedish) okay but a little cheap looking. Housekeeping was not to great. The first night housekeeping forgot to put a sheet on my bed and a few times the maid didn't empy out my garbage can; she also didn't bother to sweep or dust sometimes. The view on the roof was great. The bar was nice, but we never got a chance to spend anytime there because it was always very busy. I would not recommend this hotel.

The staff were all very courteous and helpful. I had an upper level room, which I would recommend if you are interested in sleeping. Others in my group were on the lower 4 floors and could hear the club music all night. The rooms were well-equipped, but tiny. I felt like I was on a cruise ship. Paneled walls on either side of a double bed, which was actually like a futon rather than a standard boxspring/mattress combination. There was a tiny desk, which I could not even sit at with my laptop. I actually doubled over with laughter upon first seeing the bathroom- everything was miniaturized! The tub was approx 2/3 of a normal tub size with a clear window that was open to the room. This could be a problem if you are sharing a room with a colleague or friend. There was a pedestal sink, toilet and a shelf or two, squeezed into approx 3 feet of space. I am a small person, so was able to navigate fine. However, I was glad my 6'2\" husband wasn't with me- his knees surely would have hit the wall if sitting on the toilet. All in all, I really enjoyed my stay. Great ambience downstairs, quite a club scene. Easy walking distance to many things I was interested in seeing. However, this is more of an \"experience\" than a hotel. I would not take young children to this place, and honestly if on business would stay elsewhere. The desk was just not practical for working on a laptop, and the bed wasn't comfortable enough to sit and work there very easily.

My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this charming trendy hotel. We arrived, and upon arrival before we even go out of our taxi, 2 bellman opened the doors and had our luggage in the hotel! We got in early that morning and our room would not be ready until the 3pm check in time, so we left our bags with the bellman and as we proceeded out into the rain/sleet/snow, the concierge handed us complimentary use of 2 umbrellas.

It had a queen bed with very nice linens, down comforter and 4 down pillows. It looked beautiful and had solid wood floors throughout the room. Very stylish, and very user friendly. Now, don't get me wrong, the room was small in comparison to what you might expect coming from another city, but it was in no way a hinderance to us enjoying this hotel.

And other places i.e. a great pizza joint, small supermarket, 24 hour coffee shop, CVS, etc. were right around the corner. The staff members were attentive and very friendly. They had internet access available in a common area, and the gym wasn't all that awful looking either (didn't use it, though). The room was clean and the bed was so comfortable...heaven! And on Marathon Morning, the staff had complimentary water and power bars downstairs at the check in/out area. Nice touch! But really, LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!!! That was key! I was really hurting the day after the race, and the staff was so nice in assisting me with my bags down the escalator. The Bad: Teeny-tiny television set, but then again, the room was very small, so a normal sized tv probably couldn't have fit in there. No small fridge, bath tub or coffee maker (all essentials for my pre- and post-race rituals). No dressers for clothes, small closet. For the most part, my clothes stayed in my suit cases. But hey, I got the room thru priceline, and at an awesome rate, so for NYC, you could do a LOT worse. The Ugly: Nothing....I loved the contemporary styling of the rooms and the hotel. My bathroom was spacious enough (although no tub...oh, how I needed a hot bath after the race, but that's ok). The club was opened until 3am or 4am, looked like a lot of fun (couldn't go...had to rest), and the noise stayed downstairs, which was great as it was critical that I got a good nite's sleep before the race. I've read other reviews pertaining to the dissatisfaction of some because of the room size, and yes, they are very tiny. But for me, the Hudson served it's purpose. It gave me a clean, quiet, COMFORTABLE place to sleep.

My expectations for short stay rooms are simple: clean, with a comfortable bed and good shower. Friendly and accommodating staff are a bonus. My experience with the Hudson was lacking in many respects. My room was small, but there was no knocking its simplicity and clean lines. The bed was very comfortable. The peek-a-boo style bath was a neat stylistic touch. The problem that plagued me throughout my stay was an inability to control the temperature of the room. The problem was apparently unique to my unit (1931), as my colleagues had thermostats in theirs. When I checked in, it was freezing with a horrible draft coming from the closed window behind the bed. I mentioned the problem to the front desk before leaving for dinner and returned to nothing short of a sauna. My shower the next morning was terrible. The water simply trickled vertically from the showerhead and did little to freshen me up after a night in sweat. When asked how my stay was on checkout, I mentioned that it was not satisfactory and outlined why. The attendant offered repeated apologies - \"I'm so sorry\", \"I'm so sorry about the issues\", but offered nothing more. I was not expecting a free room by any means, but a semblance of sincerity would have been appreciated. I recognize that stays like mine are simply hit and miss bad luck.

Everything was great from the moment I walked in thanks to the escalator under a yellow light to my early departure time 3 days later. I stayed there the 25-26-27jan. The lobby is huge beautiful in wood dark with a big chandelier. The library is FANTASTIC, the bar gives u the groove to go on at night, very stylish. My room was a superior room 170sqft for 170dol. Great comfort, great deal very well designed. Love the wood on the wall and the imaculate down comforter. The contrast is incredible. Love the lamp too on both sides of the bed. You feel like to be in a cabin of a cruise ship. The bathroom is small white like at the delano but with all amenities. The staff was friendly and helpful, thank you Kimberly to let me see the studio and deluxe studio. VERY VERY BEAUTIFUL. I was in buisness trip. The size of the room didn t bother me. I travel a lot. A lot of rooms in NYC are small. Or YOU just have to go in Paris or other cities in europe and you ll see. So all the comments about the size is for people who doesn t travel too much and have stayed only in the the same brand and same smell hotel that you can find all over the world nothing special. I was by myself so the superior room was really enough but I checked the studio and deluxe studio they are much bigger and VERY VERY NICE I ll call that a bit luxurious in dark wood and white bed and sofa. But a bit more expensive. Music, Trendy, comfort, clean friendly designed, and stylish qualified the HUDSON hotel. A lot of european are staying there. I wanted to find another kind of hotel, an hotel who can brings you to a different atmosphere and make you feel different. I found it. Don t pay attention to the dark coridor, who cares , but look at the little yellow light above each door. Don t pay attention the size of the room but open your mind and let you transported by the music the style and the design. The bar is wonderful, of course it s not cheap, 12dol the martini, but you re in new york and in a incredible atmosphere with a cool and good looking crowd. So who cares if you pay a couple of bucks more. You don t find that everywhere and you don t spend 12dol in a maritini everyday. So If you have an opened mind, If you have the experience of the same old hotel brand and you want something different, If you are ready to open your eyes to observe all the details of the design, the Hudson is for you.

For a moment you wonder if you are taking part in \"2001:Space Odyssey\" as you ascend up the indirectly lit Chartreuse escalators. The lobby looks like a Tim Burton movie, with a massive chrystal hollographic chandelier. Aside from the beauty of the building, the staff is also attractive, friendly, and very attentive.

Well attention folks, you are staying at a hotel that was developed by one of the guys responsible for Studio 54, what did you expect? None of these complaints are valid as you can clearly go to the hotel website and know what to expect. The size of the rooms is small, pay a tiny bit more and opt for the Double Double (which I did). Even in the smaller rooms, however, there are cleverly designed hooks and shelves along with comfy beds. The music is actually great (techno, house, trance), the lighting is very dramatic unlike most other hotels, the parties sometimes include prominent people and celebrities, and the bars are all very unique.

We stayed for 5 nights in a queen room for $150 a night- a bargain in New York given the location and new-ness of the hotel. Yes it was small, but certainly not as tiny we imagined, and we live in a studio city apartment. Besides, New York is not a place where you come to just to sit in your room. The room itself was stylish, well designed for it's size, clean and quiet. The only complaint we might have was that the key tended to stick in the lock which made opening the door noisy. We also did not have any of the issues stated by other people on this site about the bathroom's size, and my husband is 6'2. The bedlinens and towels were of a good quality and the beds heavenly after 26 hours flying. The communal spaces are beautiful and are what makes the hotel. Yes, the hallway is dark, but well lit enough- after all you're not going to sit there and read a newspaper. The concerns raised on this site about the noise level in the lobby were not an issue. Yes there is \"noise\" or music playing but we never found it intrusive- actually found the lobby very quiet except in the evening. We got into the bar without having to wait at midnight on a Friday, despite the line, and were seated at a table right away- also no problems with the service. Although the tables all had \"reserved\" signs on them, ignore this, this proved not to be the case in our experience. The garden was quiet and relaxing when not in use as a bar- perfect for reading the paper early in the morning. While we didn't eat at the cafeteria, they provided free morning coffee which was appreciated. We did not attempt to use the in-room internet service as the library had free internet, which I made good use of. The terrace on the 15th floor was also a beautiful place to sit quietly and have a drink at sunset. The staff were pleasant, efficient and professional.

Luckily at night they have a big yellow light over the door so when you stumble back to the hotel after a few cocktails you can find your way. We were greeted with 'check in is at 3:00, we may have a room available by 4:00.'

We asked for double beds and were told that there would be a $90 surcharge. The room was tiny. No, seriously tiny. We couldn't unpack because there was no dresser or any other place to put clothes. The closet was less than a foot wide so couldn't even store our bags in it. The bathroom was so small that you had to sit sideways on the toilet (and I'm only 5' 6\"). I thought the glass wall between the shower and the room was odd but it did make the shower feel less claustrophic. Called for extra towels at 9:30 on Sunday morning. When we checked out at 11:00 on Tuesday, we were still waiting for the towels. The hotel itself was reasonably quiet. Our room faced the courtyard so street noise wasn't too bad for the fourth floor.

Other reviewers complain about this hotel for a lot of reasons. Most of those reasons are absolutely true, but it all depends on your attitude. For example: 1. Yes, the rooms are extremely small. But they are stylish, comfortable, and most important, thoughtfully designed. I remember my first time checking into the Hudson, looking into the tiny bathroom, and thinking, \"uh oh, this is going to be awful.\" But I discovered that there are thoughtful little hooks, shelves, and tables aplenty in the rooms and was surprised to find that those touches made all the difference...I've stayed there for weeks at a time on business travel and never felt the least bit crowded. 2. Yes, there is music in the lobby and it is loud in the evenings. The Hudson is very hip and trendy and does have a nightclub feel. However, it is only in the lobby. They must have some excellent soundproofing, as even the rooms on the floor right above the lobby are utterly silent, 24 hours a day. Noise has never been a problem for me when I have stayed at this hotel. 3. Some aspects of the hotel are expensive. The room service food seems very expensive when you look at the menu, but it is the same food that is served at the Hudson Cafeteria, which is an excellent, well-respected restaurant. The food is sublime and costs about as much as you would expect to pay for a higher-end meal in New York. So, again, the complaints are all based on true facts but it depends on your preferences. The things other people complain about don't bother me. What is more important to me is the fact that the rooms are spotless and quiet, the beds are heavenly to sleep in (seriously--more comfortable than my bed at home), the towels are thick and soft, and the service is good. Whether or not you will like this hotel depends on your attitude. If like me you're used to living in a studio apartment in an urban neighborhood, you will probably like this hotel.

My problem is that the Hudson is all flash and no substance. From the very beginning things just weren't quite right. There is no outside sign, the doorman must have been used to the confusion since everyone who passed with a suitcase was asked \"looking for the Hudon?\". The escalators to the main lobby have clearly been reconditioned from the buildings former existence as a YMCA. Very claustrophbic, but with venetian plaster. The problem here was that the plaster was all chipped. My reception was \"It's only 1:30, checkin is at 3:00\". Not somthing like \"I'm sorry, we have no room at this moment\". I then sat in the lobby for awhile and watched others (apparently the younger and hipper) being assigned rooms. My inquiry then netted me my cell for the night. My stay in the lobby gave me a chance to observe the cave-like qualities of this space. Full of beautiful people, but one wonders what they look like in the light of day. The hallways on the sleeping floors are indeed dark and narrow - dimly lit and unappealing. My cell didn't give me enough room to turn around in. I've stayed in many small European hotel rooms - this one is unparalled in its lack of space. The room was quite worn - dirty spots on the walls, chipping and peeling plaster around the windor, the white headboard was none too clean. Lots of street noise came in through the window - on the 19th floor! I saw some couples checking in with 4 or 5 bags. I have NO IDEA where they would have put all of it. Upsides? The linens were amazingly wonderful, bathroom amenities great, I loved the window in the shower that added light to the bathroom while also letting me see out. I didn't hear any internal noise - just the noise from the outside. As hard as the lack of space is to disguise from the entry of the room I did think that the designer had done a good job of making the room seem larger that it was once you were inside. Some might have found them tacky, but I really appreciated the wall pegs that let me line everything up for a quick hop into my clothes before my 5:00 a.m. departure.

But even they realise that money is money whoever is spending! Concierge was first class. We returned to NY again in Sep 04 and we stayed at Morgans but in hindsight preferred the Hudson. Why am I writing this now ? Well I'm looking for a hotel to take my 21yr old daughter in Feb and - yes, I'm going to book Hudson because she'll just love the bars and the whole ambience and the quirky decor.

But after reading the incongruent reviews I feel I must give a sensible and somehow objective review. The Hudson is a modern astounding hotel, tastefully decorated with trendy bars and restaurants which, although mostly visited by the NY young hip crowd, does not make an out-of-towner feel out-of-place. If you want to experience the NY nightlife at its best you can remain in the hotel have plenty of cocktails and look at beautiful people in beautiful surroundings. For a brief moment you will feel that you are part of the hip, rich NY crowd. However, once you leave the common areas and board the elevator, still large and beautiful, you will be sent back to your first year college dorm. When you get off the elevator you are sent into a gray dark maze with hundreds of doors. The doors are so close to each other you will probably wonder if each room has two doors. Well, wrong. The rooms are incredibly small - key work being incredibly. It is 10 x 10 w/ a queen bed and two small tables, one small window overlooking nothing, and a tv the size of a telephone. Trust me, this is by far the smallest room you could have stayed at. There was another review indicating that it was the size of a monk's cell. Well, I have been to a monk's cell and it was larger than the standard room at the Hudson. Now, once you get over the size of the room you realize that it is not so bad, the rooms are clean and nicely decorated, the bed is comfortable and the tiny bathroom has all the amenities. All in all, not so bad. I went w/ my wike for the weekend and had an excellent time. Then again, we were already expecting small - not that much- but we had an idea before arriving. If you want a fun short getaway to NY - this is the place.

We bought the summer promotion which included full American breakfast and slightly larger room (150 sq ft) for $205. I was thinking about the promo which included parking, but I'm glad I didn't get that one since there is a LOT of free street parking everyday after 7PM and all day Sunday. The people at the front desk were very nice to us. I requested an upgrade but since the hotel was fully booked, they were able to give us a corner room (#776) which had more windows. Our room partly faced the inner courtyard, but we couldn't hear any loud music from the bar nor any taxis honking. The room was impeccable and the bathroom was spotless. It was a small room, probably smaller than the typical guest room in someone's house. It helped that we were local and didn't have any luggage, otherwise I could understand some complaints from travelers about where to store belongings.

After I dragged my bags up the escalator to the front desk, I was told I could not check into my room early, so after dragging my suitcases down the escalator again to be stored, (and up again second time around when i eventually checked in - where the hell were the bell boys!), i wandered around the streets of NY for 3 hrs, just in time for my jetlag to really start kicking in. From there on in things certainly didnt improve. At 11.05pm that nite when i finally got the urge to have some dinner (or an early lunch where i had just flown in from), I was told by the front desk that room service had just finished, however there were plenty of fast food alternatives within walking distance. I preferred to go to bed hungry. The room was tiny, the bathroom even tinier (hotel bathrooms in tokyo are larger!), there is hanging space but no shelves to place your other clothes (there was one shelf below the tv, however that was used to display Hudson souvenirs for sale, just in case you wanted to take home a reminder of your \"memorable\" stay there), the corridors were dark and dingy, the breakfast room order menu was only placed in my room on the first nite, and thereafter never to be seen again, and on one particular morning, I left some clothes in the laundry bag on my bed to be cleaned (the form was filled in explaining what was needed to be done), however when i got back that evening and found it to be sitting where I had left it, I was told by housekeeping that I needed to call to let them know it was to be cleaned (did the staff there not have any initiative to look inside the bag?!). Despite asking for a room at the back of the hotel, as suggested by one of the reviews on this site in order to avoid sleepless nites, music came pumping up from the bar till 2am one evening.

One thing to remember, if you're into going to bed early, then I suggest when you check-in you request a room that is not located near The Park courtyard bar.

The famous Hudson Bar is so-so (think \"Logan's Run.\" If you've seen the movie then you'll realize that most of the people staying in the hotel are under the age of 30). As for the bar itself, the drinks are very over priced ($30 for 2 Coronas and one vodka and cranberry). The people who hang out at the bar are 99.9% New Yorkers. You have to see the bar to believe it because most of the people there try so hard to be hip and cool they end up looking ridiculous (some of them were actually posing!!). Aside from the bar, beware of room service. They charge a 15% gratuituy, plus a $3.50 delivery fee, plus a room service charge. So, a $5 pot of coffee ended up costing $12. All in all I still enjoyed this place. The decor and set up of the hotel is very unique and fun. The music played in the elevators was good (house music), though they could do with a decent DJ in the bar (someone from the Ministry of Sound UK would do nicely). I'd definitely stay there again.

Behind the lobby is the 'Park' Its an oasis of serene greenery and comfy seating that doesn't try to be anything more than a great place to relax, supp on a decent drink and mingle with the 'friday' crowd. The waitresses were impeccably dressed with evocative but stylish attire that aided the desire to order more drinks from them! The library bar takes you to another feeling. Its grandly laced in strong veneers and woods, the pool table sits perfectly and the whole bar has a modern gent feel to it.

There really is only about one foot around the double bed - which is really a futon, and the bathroom is so small my knees touched the wall when I was on the loo (I'm only 5'5\"). The closet is so small the suitcase doesn't fit, so you have to leave it the small hallway by the bathroom. The bathroom has a glass shower that looks to the \"bedroom\". If you're travelling with someone who's an exhibitionist and you're a voyeur, it's fine - otherwise it's ridiculous. The lighting is bad, it is so dark. There are not enough plug-ins, if you're female (or male, whatever) and you like to do your hair and make-up, forget it - there is no place to put your stuff. I'm certain there was some kind of mold, because I got terribly congested - moved hotels after one night, no congestion... The very dark exterior hallways aren't dark enough to hide the stains on the carpets. The staff was snotty and very ineffiecient. The restuarant \"The Cafeteria\" was expensive for what you got and the service was terrible. It also has long tables like a cafeteria and benches. Sorry, but if I'm spending $30 on an entre I want a proper chair and I don't want to sit with strangers. One night was more than I could take, so I moved over to The Marriot - same price, real bed, real bathroom, clean, great staff.........need I say more!", "Date": "May 13, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1933478", "Content": "This hotel is perfect for NYC, unless you NEED a ton of room.

Remember that the only people who write reviews on these sites are those who have an axe to grind. I'm adding mine as a way of redressing the balance as I was SO nervous before we came. I actually made the mistake of booking the Hudson before I had read the reviews - and my heart sank when I did (both here and on hotel.com) - possibly the worst reviews I have ever seen about a hotel. It almost ruined the trip; I was expecting Naomi Campbell vomiting in the pot plants and Kate Moss weeping hysterically in our doorway, but we found the whole experience rather genteel and elegant (in a modern, minimalist way of course). We went over a weekend and there was never the sense that it was party central, we slept well despite the bar being crowded (it's fantastic for Sex and the City-type people watching, but defintely not intimidating - and the cocktails cheap for NYC). Even the staff were courteous and efficient (despite being annoyingly good looking). That said, all of the complaints on this site have an element of truth. There WAS clanking plumbing (once a night for a few minutes), the doors DO slam (not enough to wake you) and the corridors ARE dark and in need of a little TLC. But I would genuinely say that was balanced by the cool decor and atmosphere (yes, it is cool, but that's not a bad thing and that's why you come here isn't it?), it has a great location right by the park AND it's cheap for a quality Manhatten hotel (we got it for under $100 each). If you're worried, I'd say ask for a room higher up the hotel away from the bar and/or upgrade which gives you plenty of space. Finally, I'd like to take issue with my fellow reviewers who say it's your fault for being so square - when you're in New York, of course you should get out and live it, but it IS important to come back to a nice hotel room to relax and recharge for the next adventure. I'd say that the Hudson is a fine place to do that.

However, the guest quarters are not as worthy of praise. The hallway carpets were filthy and our room had a very strong smell (we concluded it was the aromatherapy that is available in the minibar for purchase.)

I could actually hear the bass from the sound system thumping as I laid in bed at 2am trying to sleep. The food in the restaurant is fair, but the prices are too high for the quality that was served.

After finding a great promotional rate through the hotel's own website--the rate included overnight parking, which is usually an outrageous $50!--I booked a standard room. The hotel's lobby is beautiful, as are most of its common areas, and the rooms, though small, are aesthetically pleasing. I can't say that the rooms weren't small, but, you know, in almost any comparable hotel, you're not going to get any that are much larger without paying a good deal more. My room was appointed with a low queen bed, a small desk and chair, two huge wall mirrors, and three small lamps (there was no overhead lighting, which was annoying). The only place to really sit in comfort was the bed, and there was just barely enough room on either side of that to access the small end tables. The bathroom was likewise small, but clean. On that note, I'd like to issue a word of warning to anyone traveling with a companion, which involves the fact that the bathroom is separated from the rest of the room by a wall with a floor-length window, and might cause some issues for modest people (there were two thin curtains to cover it up, but they didn't really do much). The service at the hotel was not bad--certainly not the snobby, pretentious type encountered by many other reviewers--but I see how it would be easy to be intimidated by the young, hip staff. The Hudson Bar, by the way, looked to be peopled mostly with tacky types and wouldn't probably have held enough to interest most people outside the Schrager scene, but the Library Bar in the hotel was much more laid back and relaxing. In short: don't go here if you're looking for lots of space or wonderfully attentive, friendly service, but if you're young and don't mind being a little cramped in order to experience a trendy, unique hotel--and you get a good rate!--go for it.", "Date": "January 20, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Daytona Beach, FL", "Title": "\u201cI've stayed in some great NYC hotels...this isn't one of them.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1558267", "Content": "Ok, the hotel is cool and trendy, at least superficially.

If so, it would seem difficult to get a balanced opinion. In any case, as I researched where to stay in New York City for several trips I've taken in the last couple of years, I avoided staying at the Hudson because of the abundance of negative reviews. In fact, I was amazed at how many consistently negative reviews were posted at this website for the Hudson. Most of them seem to complain about the small room size and unpleasant staff. The day after New Years, as I was attending an event at the Lincoln Center with my daughter, and hotel location was very important to us, I opted to give the Hudson a try. Apprehensive of room size, I asked for a deluxe double (with two beds). Apprehensive of staff problems, I called again the day before (directly to the hotel) to confirm my reservation. Overall our stay at the Hudson was excellent. The modern design, which is impressive, I won't comment on much, for it's not why I stayed there. The room and bathroom were spacious enough and tastefully designed. Beds were very comfortable. Amenities were good (bathrobes, fluffy comforters, CD and TV choices, cool lighting). In every encounter with the staff, we were treated very courteously and felt welcome. The staff we met and dealt with included two from housekeeping, three bellmen, three front desk people, two restaurant hosts, and two waiter/waitresses. So, in dealing with 12 different staff persons (and yes, most of them were young and cool and fashionable), all of them were very nice and professional and gracious. In response to those who are wary of small room size, I suggest paying the extra $50 or whatever it is, to upgrade to a deluxe room, and maybe let the staff know your concerns by calling the hotel directly. In response to those wary of rude New Yorkers, don't be. I've stayed at about a dozen different hotels in New York City within the last 3 years, and would rank the Hudson staff among the best. The room, though not the most spacious or much of a window view, above average. Bed comfort excellent. Hotel design something to see, even if you're not staying there.

Following my experiences, I believe that much of the positive feedback about this hotel stems from the visually stimulating common areas: the minimalist and futuristic entrance, the beautiful lobby, the really \"cool\" bar with it's yellow glass floor and couches made from logs. During my first stay at the Hudson, I was intrigued by this aspect of the hotel and overlooked all other less positive factors. True, the rooms are small, as this is New York City, but the bathrooms are unacceptably small. The dark wood floors and walls are nice and the minimalist and modern furnishings are cool, but on my second stay at the Hudson, all of the asthetic charms and the novelty had worn off. The service is less than stellar for such a allegedly \"chic\" hotel with the desk staff failing to providing a warm welcome one finds at real service hotels. The halls are quite dark, with a run down look from wear and tear giving the feel of being in a tenanment building. A stay last New Year's told the tale of the management of this over rated place. I booked the Hudson due to the proximity to Lincoln Center where I was attending a New Year's concert. Big mistake.This hotel was like a college dorm party. It seemed like everyone was 21 and the staff did nothing to maintain a sense of order. Beer cans in the halls with spilled drink glasses and garbage. Noisy and out of control. No concern for the paying customers was shown and for close to $300 or more a nite, it was a disgrace. All common areas were closed for partiers paying a high separate fee to have the \"priviledge \" to attend. No consideration was given to at least have the small library bar open for guests wanting to have a drink. Why should they when Britney Spears has paid big bucks to rent out that area for her own private party? Plus, to have the privilege of being herded in and out through a service entrance used for deliveries and trash because the lobby was closed for the big party, the experience was a nightmare and simply inexusable. No advance notice was given upon booking warning of the closing of all facilities so that mangement of this place could rake in the dough from non-guests.The Hudson may be worth a look and that's it, a look.

The room was small but the design is so good looking and the bed was incredibly comfortable. It was also very clean. The hotel staff was nice. The neighborhood was great, we left and walked around Lincoln center and found a great place to eat just 5 blocks away. The park is right there too. The only thing I didnt like was the other patrons. When we were in the bar and on the patio early in the night is was great but when we came back from dinner at 12 it was packed and no one was allowed out on the patio anymore. People were around trying to be fabulous and not really pulling it off. It was like being in a bad club. That being said, we were able to get a few beers and find a nice spot in the hallway - there are many places to sit (for 2) and people watch. Overall, the hotel was interesting to look at, the Saturday night scene was a bit much, and the rooms were cool. A nice place to stay for a night or two if you want a little vacation in the city.", "Date": "September 2, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "S.F., CA", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Staff!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1270244", "Content": "I've stayed at the Mondrian in L.A. (another Ian hotel) where the staff was pretentious, but hey I was in Hell-ay! The Hudson was great from when we checked in. Yes the rooms were tiny but I anticipated that going in based on other reviews. Everyone was wrong on the staff. Yes it's a little annoying showing your guest card everytime you go upstair but because the Hudson Bar turns into somewhat of a club in the evening they do it so people aren't running through the halls of your $155/night 144 sq. ft. rooms. The security team did suggest when to come to the bar, escorted us to the door, and even took care of our drinks all night long. Which ended up being 6 Midori Sours, 1 rum & coke, and 1 Shirley Temple. They told us who the regulars where, and who to stay away from. Also we were told of a private party the next evening. I think if people treated the staff as actually people and not lower class citizens they'd get better results.", "Date": "August 31, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "northern NJ", "Title": "\u201cHip & Stylish\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1263945", "Content": "I chose the Hudson Hotel as part of a special evening for my boyfriend who loves places that look modern, contemporary, and stylish. The Hudson is definitely one of those places. I paid $220 (without taxes and add-ons) for a deluxe room with a bigger bathroom; buffet breakfast was included the next day. Yeah, it's a little pricey, but staying at a hotel that had a chic, youthful, vibrant sort of sex appeal was worth it. It's great for people-watching, the Private Park bar area was fun, the decor is tasteful and whimsical, and I don't think room size is really an issue unless you're planning to spend all your time in there. But why would you in a city like New York where there are so many other things to do?? I have read reviews where people complained about the service, but my experience with the staff was pleasant enough. There are a mix of people here, but I'd say most are relatively young and trendy and in their 20s, 30s, early 40s. If you're not into a place that is a \"scene\" or want a more traditional room a la something at the Four Seasons, this isn't the hotel for you. For something fun and hip with some quirkiness, try the Hudson.", "Date": "August 28, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincs, UK", "Title": "\u201cAvoid it\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1223338", "Content": "A disaster with the booking arrangements on arrival meant much of our first evening was spent on the phone to the tour operators British Airways in the UK (mistakes happen!).

The problem was resolved by the intervention of British Airways who funded a complete room upgrade. A massive thank you and congratulations to British Airways for your excellent client care!

We stayed Friday through Tuesday, and enjoyed every minute of it. There was no wait to get into the bar on Sat. night for us. Since we were guests, we were given passes that allowed us to forgo the line. Our room was clean and sleek. If you are not used to city traffic and noise, which we are not, ask to be placed on a higher floor. We stayed on the 14th floor and had no problems with noise whatsoever. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly to us. From the desk attendants, to the concierge, bartenders and everyone else we encountered who worked there, we didn't experience any of the rudeness I have heard so much of. I think this hotel is definitely for the young. My husband and I are 25/23, and we felt very comfortable and satisfied at the Hudson. Yes, the rooms are small, but it's New York!!!
