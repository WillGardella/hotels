The hotel is by no means quiet, especially if you find yourself road-side, plus the interior doors tend to slam quite heavily.

Although they couldn't move us the first day they upgraded us for our second night to a great room overlooking one of the Sorbonne buildings. This is a very stylishly decorated and furnished hotel which perhaps will not be to everyone's taste and I wonder whether it might look a little dated in a few years. I liked the decor personally. Every room has an iMac though why you'd want to be on the internet when you have the Latin Quarter at your doorstep is slightly beyond me. Breakfast is a little peculiar in that you have to make your own eggs and the dining room is small and stuffy. We didn't get breakfast the second day and actually there are plenty of great places around to get a decent French breakfast. The location is great for sights and close to several metro stations.

The location of the hotel is fantastic, it is 10 minutes walk from Notre Dame and the Seine and there is a metro station 5 minutes walk away. Because the metro station is so near, it is really easy to get to the hotel from the airport, just one 30 minute train ride, however getting the train tickets at the airport was quite confusing. I would recommend queuing up to get a travel card, we got one for 5 days but you can get them for 1,2,3 or 5 days, it gave us access to all the metros, trains and buses, it was really good value and meant we didn't have to walk everywhere. Having said that we still walked about 50 miles, the city is really beautiful, but by the last day our legs were very tired! There is a lovely restaurant just round the corner from the hotel which was recommended by the hotel. We also found a lot of really good restaurants and bars off the Boulevard Saint Germain, which was a 15 minute walk, a particularly good one was La Jacobine which was on rue Saint Andres des arts, just off the Boulevard. The hotel itself was well decorated, really modern and trendy. The rooms were quite small but we expected that. The staff were really helpful, we arrived early for check in and they managed to get our room ready early so we could leave our bags and start sightseeing. One day our heating stopped working and it was really cold, the staff got us a heater straight away and offered for us to move rooms.

Our only complain was the shower. It was the tiniest I've seen, and I've been all over Europe and am accustomed to small rooms. I couldn't take a shower without the shower curtain clinging to my body, and when I tried to gain some room by turning sideways in the shower I would often bump the shower handle, scalding or freezing myself often.

I have stayed at the Hotel du Pantheon before so had high expectations of the hotel. It was nicely decorated in a very modern style. Good for the young. The hotel has a few drawbacks, none of which are deal breakers but something you need to think about: 1. It is very noisy if you have a room facing the street. If you choose this place then ask for a room facing into the courtyard - others staying at the hotel tell me it was beautifully quiet 2. Linens aged - towels especially small 3. No corkscrew in the room, and when we asked at reception we were told we were not permitted to open a bottle of red wine in our room unless we agreed upfront to pay any damages. This is insane. If you cant do this then make it part of the note for the booking. Caveat emptor. When in France drink a good Bordeaux!! 4. The rooms were oppressively hot. We turned the heater off but still hot, so we had to open the windows and then the noise was bothersome and you woke up freezing. So need to work on temperature control Advantages: 1. Location perfect- short walk to Rue St Germain, Notre Dame, the Pantheon, the Latin Quarter for dinner 2.

Happy to give us a map, pointing out which sites to visit, order taxis etc. We didn't bother with the breakfast in the hotel as, for 13 euros, it was just bog standard cartons of yoghurt, bread, croissants etc. i.e. nothing freshly cooked, apart from eggs. The person at reception was happy to recommend a few places a couple of minutes walk / 2 streets away. We were very pleased with the creparrie that we chose, and had a fantastic breakfast there, for much less than it would have cost in the hotel.

Had a safe in the room which was free and easy to use to store valuables and good storage space to put clothes and cases etc. Free apple mac computer was a bonus to keep in touch with news and also research places, sites and restaurants to visit in Paris. Location was good with restaurants, bars and shops, metro system all just around the corner. Close to Pantheon and market ,15 min walk to river with view of Notre Damme and a further 10-15 mins walk across river to Louvre. Overall the hotel was perfect for what we needed at a good price and an excellent location away from too much hustle and bustle.

We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel, as we prefer coffee and a croissant at local cafes, (which is both cheaper and more authentically 'Paris'). However, if we'd wanted a full buffet breakfast, the rate would have been reasonable. We booked on a special deal, making the hotel a reasonable price for central Paris, and this governs our value rating. We may have thought twice if we'd had to pay the 'rack rate'.

You have a choice of toast, fresh fruit, fresh pastries, bread, ham, boiled egg and yoghurts served with either fresh orange juice, tea or coffee.

I picked the classic room. It's super tiny. The size of the room was 3x3 cubic meter and the bathroom was 2 meter length and 1/2 meter wide! Can you imagine to sit in a toilet with a sink and a shower with that size? It was impossible to sit in a toilet without touching the sink & a toilet paper. I couldn't bend myself to pick up something that I dropped. It reminded me of a toilet in a train. On the next day, I asked if there was an available superior room for us. There was luckily on the same floor that the guest checked out later that day. We supposed to pay 30 euro extra, but the receptionist was nicely lowered it to 20 euro extra. We got then bigger room, a normal size room. If you want to stay in this hotel and do not want to have a claustrophobic experience, it's best to book a superior room. Other things: Cleanliness: we got once a clean towel with a red spot there. We didn't use it. Service: all receptionist were so friendly and nice to us. Location: perfect. Plus things: 1.

The location could have been closer to more of a neighborhood area, like the Marais, but it was easy to get places from the hotel as it was pretty centrally located. The breakfast, which I only had one day, was pretty decent for a continental buffet and included freshly squeezed OJ.

The lift was small it was fine for two adults and two suitcases - although we did the stairs when we didn't have the luggage!

The beds were really comfy and the best bit was the Apple Mac which was in the corner with internet access - great for doing some last minute research and planning as we'd not had much time beforehand. The hotel is literally around the corner from Place Sorbonne and we can recommend breakfast in a brasserie there called Les Patios where for 7 euros each you could get breakfast which included coffee or tea, orange juice, croissant and tartine - just what you need to start a day of sighseeing! The one slightly negative thing was that the staff on reception weren't as friendly as the Hotel des Grande Hommes (well in our opinion ) they were very nice when asked questions but seemed quieter and less forthcoming that what we had experienced at their sister hotel and we didn't feel we could ask them questions about where to eat locally etc. Might be just us though and we definitely wouldn't let it put us off going here as we had such a fantastic stay in every other way and will recommend to friends and family.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado", "Title": "\u201cTres Chic\u201d", "Author": "slw06", "ReviewID": "UR82456320", "Content": "Very convenient location to metro, restraunts, shops and Notre Dame.

The bed was comfortable as were the pillows. There were two tiny bedside tables. The Apple computer/Samsung monitor worked well. We found the internet a bit slow, but okay.

It was a bit on the small side but looked out over a courtyard with lots of posh apartments and had good sunlight. The iMac in the room was very good for internet, watching TV and movies and was a great idea. There was also free wifi but the hotel doesn't put a password on the network so everyone from hotel guests to students from the Sorbonne across the road can access it. As a result, the wifi is very slow and pretty much useless - a pain if we needed to use our laptop and iPhone. On the first night we went to bed and discovered that the bed was broken. The night receptionist couldn't offer us another room because the hotel was full and his (valiant) attempt to fix the bed just made it worse. As it was too late to look for another hotel, we had to try to sleep in the busted bed. The next day it was promptly fixed but there was no real apology and no offer of a refund or any attempt to compensate for the inconvenience. We also noticed that the cleaning staff tended to fling our belongings onto the floor so that they could make the bed or tidy up, which was a little disconcerting. On the plus side - hotel is in a good location, near the Luxembourg RER station and the St Michel metro. There are nice restaurants and good shopping nearby. The Latin Quarter is very touristy but bustling and the hotel is on a quiet side street. The staff were okay, not too friendly but they spoke English. They held our bags for us after checkout.

Having been coming to Paris for 10 years I can honestly say that this was the worst hotel we have stayed, as the room was far too small, The hotel did provide a cot for our baby - however it had to be placed against the window - and babies should not sleep in a draft. So the baby was put between my husband and I in the small double bed. We could not move around the room, so to get to our clothes we had to move the travel cot onto our bed and so on. I did question whether the room was superior but I was told that it was and that others rooms had even tinier bathrooms. Our baby had nowhere but the bed to play in - but the bed had to be used for bags when it was not used for sleeping, and babies can not really play on beds as they can fall off them. Noise from the road below was load at times. The window faced onto the street, meaning that we had no privacy if the window was open and it was gloomy if the window was shut. The room was stuffy the carpet was wet by the shower/toilet - there was no bath for a baby. The Mac was small - no bigger than a 19 inch screen but the room was so small, the furniture in the room was chipped. There were not enough towels provided - the first night we were told that they had no more clean towels, the second and third night we requested more. Our stay for 3 nights was not much shy of 500 GBP. I am well aware that hotels in paris may mean small rooms, but I feel completely ripped off by the room we stayed in. Staff seemed nice enough and other guests seemed to have bigger rooms, but they should never have put us in that room - it simply was no suitable for a baby. In hindsight I should never ever have signed for the pre-payment before seeing a room.

The shower room was fine, except anyone over 5ft 6 like me needed to carry out a reversing manoeuvre to sit on the toilet via the hand basin, and the shower pan leaked due to the gap under the cubicle door, but these are just minor gripes.

The stairs and passages outside the rooms were narrow probably as most of the Paris hotels, but they are decorated with photos which adds a nostalgic hint to this modern place. The room is small but enough for daily activities. Besides no mini bar, which instead is a public one located at the breakfast place, all the facilities of a decent hotel are there, plus a Mac, which is used as both a computer and a TV. The room we selected had a bathtub, which for a couple, could be anything but for a normal bath, inviting all types of imagination. We got from Sephora several galets de bain effervescents (the bathing stuff that melt in water and give out nice smell to bath). Thought that since we have a bathtub, why not do something with it. It turned out to be a brilliant idea, which included all facets of senses - the sound (of sizzling water when the thing was melting), the temperature (of the warmth of water in such a cold day), the sight (of the person in front of you), the smell (chocolate!), and, most importantly, the taste.. and what's beyond the bath. An exceptionally fulfilling experience. Its location is also very good in that it is close to the subways and RER, as well as the two islands where the museums are located. Itself is on the right bank of Le Seine where we walk around and see lots of bookstores. There are also an area of walking street full of restaurants and bars. One only thing I can think of so far as a weakness might be the flush of the toilet. When pressed once, only minimal water flows out, which was pretty scary and embarrasing since I just finished using the toilet and dont really want to call for help. The trick is to press it for several times quickly like pumping the water. Then at around the 5th pressing, problem got solved... All in all, it's a really cozy and nice-looking small place.

(Solution: go out and enjoy Paris instead of sitting in Reception.) The noise of other guests coming in late at night does carry a little - but it's nothing a pair of earplugs couldn't defend against. The rooms are TINY, definitely don't bring a cat to swing. My single room had a double bed and had I been there as a couple we would have had to ask for an oxygen tank I think. The bathroom is almost dolls house size and body origami comes in useful for using the loo without cracking a rib on the washbasin. The same in the shower - over-enthusiastic scrubbing of body parts could result in serious bruising. However, the water is plentiful and hot and cleans just as well as it would in a shower twice the size - and who goes to Paris to spend hours in the shower or to sit in their hotel room?

It is 5 minutes walking from Notre Dame and 3 minutes walking from Luxembourg train station, which is one of the main stops of the RER (the train which takes you to both airports). The street is very quiet and has a nice environment as in the morning there are many students from the university. - Rooms: we stayed in a Design Classic double. 113 euros / night. The room looks exactly as in the website. Our room was blue and brown, and had a big Mac screen which worked as a TV and computer. There is also wireless in the room. The room is not very big, but I would say it is fair enough. Big comfortable bed, closet, mirror, window overlooking the Sorbonne, night tables, desk, computer\u2026The en-suite bathroom is extremely clean and a little bit small (but I think this is not a problem).

If you are looking for traditional, prob best to try their other hotels (think French toile)!

I know Paris hotels are renowned for small rooms, and to be honest, I am not that bothered about the bedroom size as I don't usually spend too long in it, but the shower room was almost impractical and there was no bath. We had booked a superior room and that was pretty dinky so I am not sure what the bedroom/WC size is like in the lower garded rooms. At the Grandes Hommes, the rooms were still quite small, but the bathroom was fully equipped and two of us could at least stand in it at any one time. That said it was all immaculately clean and I slept amazingly. Breakfast was included in our price and did the purpose, but if you are staying on a room early, I am not sure it is entirely worth the 8E or 12E as it is not a very extensive buffet (there is no buffet for the 8E option).

Convenient, as well. This is a non-smoking hotel :) THE ODD: The hotel has the smallest elevator that I have ever seen. My friend and I needed to take two trips to get to our room with our luggage. In order to turn on the room lights, one has to stick the room key into a special slot in the closet. Although our room had two twin beds, they were pushed right together so it was almost like sharing the same bed (in the hotel's defense, I noticed this layout in photos of other Paris hotels). My e-mail would not work when I selected Internet from the Mac menu - it would only work when I chose the At Work option from the menu. NOTE: As this is Paris, the keyboard is a French one. It takes some getting used to. I typed with two fingers the whole time. THE NOT-AS-GOOD (BUT CERTAINLY NOT HORRIBLE): We arrived about an hour early and room was, understandbly, not ready. We were told to come back in half an hour. We returned hour (decided to go to the Pantheon) and room still was not ready and had to wait an extra 15 minutes. Wonderful lady at the front desk (whose name I forgot to ask), offered us coffee and juice while we waited. Pillow was too high and stiff for my liking. Phone connection, at least for long distance calls, was a bit too crackly. Only one soap and one shower gel was provided upon arrival, even though this was a room for two people.", "Date": "July 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cA little gem\u201d", "Author": "travel_reviewer01", "ReviewID": "UR35554788", "Content": "The design aspect and location next to the Sorbonne in the Latin Quarter are central elements so if you're kind of artistic and like a mix of old-fashioned French/modern art then you'll love it here.

Regarding some other reviews I have seen on tripadvisor: I don't know about the courtyard noise --- I did not hear any so the renovation must be over or in hiatus currently. The bedbug complaint that was written here freaked me out so I inspected the hotel room thoroughly and this claim is not validated --- larvae are visible to the naked eye. The room we stayed in was meticulously kept. I stayed a week and neither myself nor my husband got bites and it's been a week and we've seen nothing.

The room is very small. And we had the 2nd biggest room on the floor, according to the evacuation map I saw pasted on the door of the room. While I understand that most rooms in Paris are small, I have stayed in bigger rooms in previous trips at a similar price. I just tend to try a new hotel each time, if you are wondering why I did not just go back to the other hotels I have stayed at. When our suitcase was opened, there was no walking space. But to be fair, the 5 shelves in the storage area in the room, provided enough space for putting our clothes and stuff. There is no wardrobe, only a column of shelves with a curtain over it. I call this the storage area. The bed is very small. The other reviewer said the bed was 1.60m wide. Ours should have been narrower because I \"measured\" the bed with my height. When I lie across the bed, my legs stick out. The bed was very soft. If you like soft beds, then good for you. The bathroom is also very small. But it has a very nice rainshower. The iMac in the room provided an opportunity to surf the internet, watch TV, listen to music, etc. There was also an iMac in the lobby. I could always hear the coming and going of the guests in the room next to ours, but once they were in their room, I could not hear them. There is a small elevator in the hotel. It did not work on one of the days when we were there. The breakfast consisted of 1 butter croissant, 1 chocolate croissant, and half a baguette each, which were brought to us in a basket when we were seated. You are not entitled to more. However, there was free flow of coffee or tea, juice, cereal, sliced bread, and yoghurt. While it was written on our confirmation email that the nearest stations are St Michel and Cluny-LaSorbonne, the nearest station is actually the Luxembourg RER Line B station, which is on the same line as the CDG airport, very convenient. The journey took 40 mins. And while it was written on our confirmation email that the check-in time was from 1pm, I was told when we arrived at 2:20pm, that the check-in time was actually 2pm. And even at 2:20pm, our room was not ready because \"there were too many people leaving that morning, your room would be ready in another 30mins\". All the staff we have met, had been very friendly. And the whole hotel - lobby, breakfast room, bedroom, bathroom - is truely very beautifully decorated, exactly like you see on its website. If you value decoration over room comfort, this hotel is for you. Otherwise, after all that walking in Paris, I would really appreciate a comfortable good night's sleep. To summarise the positives: - nice rainshower - free internet access - one elevator - convenient location - friendly staff And the negatives from my point of view: - claustrophobic room - narrow bed - very soft bed - small bathroom - thin doors - limited breakfast - room not ready way past check-in time", "Date": "November 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucks", "Title": "\u201cBeautifully designed hotel in a great location\u201d", "Author": "Philip99", "ReviewID": "UR22181551", "Content": "I'm just back from a lovely weekend break in Paris which was made all the more pleasurable by the pretty hotel de la Sorbonne.

Every room is equipped with a computer having full access to Internet, and on which you can watch TV or play DVDs. You can watch French and International channels on it. The bed was very comfortable, and I found the bedroom to be of decent size for Paris. Even if I had a single room, the bed was double and there was space to move around and put the luggage. The only down side was the bathroom, which was extremely small. Most people would say that I am quite tiny but I could just fit in this bathroom: I bruised my arm twice taking a shower and I could not get dressed in this bathroom unless the door was opened. The sink was one of the smallest I have ever seen. The room and the bathroom were clean, as well as the hotel in general. The breakfast was typically French, don't expect a full English! But it was really decent. The location of the hotel is very good, in the heart of the Quartier Latin, 5mins walk from Notre Dame and even less from the Pantheon. The RER station Luxembourg is about 5mins walk, and goes direcly to the airport Roissy-CDG in 40mins more or less, no need to change train or metro. The area is full of students as there is the Sorbonne University in the same street as the hotel, so there is plenty of restaurants and bars, and there are lots of people in the streets until late at night, so I felt quite safe.

I visited the hotel a month before and the rooms seemed OK - nothing much to write home about but maybe I was shown one of the un-refurbished rooms. 10 days prior to our arrival, my mother who is a recovering transplant and cancer patient, was advised to postpone her trip by a few days while she was being treated for a throat infection. Given her medical history, she was advised to wait to get clearance by the surgeon who operated on her during transplant as she has to take various drugs so that her body wouldn't reject the organ and he wanted to make sure that the antibiotics she was taking for the infection would not interfere with what she was already prescribed. I spoke to Arnaud at Reception and explained the situation and asked to speak to Mr Germain, the manager of the hotel who refused to speak with me. Due to the sad circumstances that were forcing us to change our travel plans, I asked if we could postpone our bookings by a week which I was refused and I was forced to pay the full amount for 2 double rooms for 3 nights in a hotel that I never ever got to stay in. When we visited Paris a week later, I dropped in at the hotel as the hotel that we stayed in called Lindberg called Arnaud and got confirmation that the manager Mr Germain was in. Of course, Mr Germain refused to come out of his office to meet with me. What I witnessed next filled me with horror even further. A hotel guest who must have been over 6 or 7 months pregnant in need of rest asked to have access to the room as her husband had gone out and taken their key with him. Arnaud told her that she would have to wait in reception till her husband who was expected 2 hours later to come back even though Mr Germain and House-keeping had spare keys. This hotel might have fancy iMacs but what guests really look for when traveling in a strange place is people with understanding and compassion which was grossly missing in this establishment.

You feel like you are staying in a local neighborhood when you walk to it from the RER/subway. The top floor is the last one to be renovated (which we stayed on) and it was fine except for no air conditioning during 2 warmer summer days when we were there in late July 2008 (staff said this is coming in 2009). This floor will be redone before the 2009 summer holiday period. These rooms were less expensive since they have the older, less fancy decor. The lower floors are already redone with an art deco design which looks very nice. The breakfast room is nice with a full continental breakfast for a modest price with a free internet Apple workstation in the lobby area which helped people checking email and making calls abroad. My apple notebook connected to the wireless hookup easily in the lobby/breakfast area but I couldn't get the signal on the 5th floor. I noticed that their pictures on a travel website were older pics than what we actually saw when we got there. If you are used to larger rooms, you will be tight here. The bathrooms are very small but very well maintained but there is no bureau or storage area other than one closet in most of the rooms. Also, there is no locking safe in the rooms for valuables so bring a lockable suitcase if you need security for your belongings. A couple of small night tables and a small writing desk & chair were the only other furniture. No pool or exercise room at the moment. The multi-lingual staff was very nice to help us with navigating Paris and the hotel was only 1.5 blocks from the Luxembourg RER & subway stop making it easy to get to both CDG & Orly airports by train and then walking to the hotel. It's about a 4-5 block hike down to the riverfront and Notre Dame where the main St. Michel metro stop is and about the same to the Odeon metro station. If you want to investigate St. Germain, you're only a couple of blocks walking distance to a trendy spot with lots of nightlife too. For \"american food die-hards\", McDonalds and Starbucks were both within 2 blocks of the hotel. This is a good hotel for the budget, travel saavy person that is mobile using buses and the metro. I highly recommend getting unlimited Paris Visite passes and hoping both to get around - the french rail and bus systems are excellent ways to get around to save your travel weary feet.

It was our first time in Paris and we already can't wait to go back! I recently became a travel agent and during training was informed that even though many tourists book hotels near the Champs Elysees or Opera, the 5th and 6th districts (Latin Quartier/St Germain de Pres) offer visitors the most authentic \"Parisian\" experience. I have to agree. While the Champs is pretty, the Left Bank is remarkable. And Hotel de la Sorbonne made our stay even more perfect. I booked Hotel de la Sorbonne because I had read about their newly renovated boutique-style rooms that featured iMac computers complete with internet access. I enjoy accommodations with character and Hotel de la Sorbonne fit the bill. I will confess that we were surprised to see that renos were still underway when we arrived. We booked 4 months prior to our trip and checked the website frequently and were under the impression renos had been completed. As of mid-May, they were in full swing, with scaffolding set up and contractors scraping away the facade loudly at the early hour of 8am. THE PROS: *The renovated Superior Room we booked was freshly decorated, clean and modern. The decor is charming. Check out my pictures! *The staff! They were incredibly helpful. My French speaking skills were \"tres weak\" but they responded with a smile and sense of humour. They all spoke excellent English but I tried to speak French as much as possible in an effort to learn. They seemed to respect my feeble attempts! Try to speak French whenever you can in France. Even if you fumble, French citizens appreciate your efforts. I found all Parisians to be very friendly and hospitable, incidentally. *North Americans must remember that accommodations in Europe tend to be smaller than in Canada, the US, Mexico and Caribbean. I found our room to be quite spacious for Europe! *The location can not be beat! It is close to everything you need: 10 minute walk to Notre Dame, Louvre, a block from the Luxembourg Gardens, St Michel, the RER to the airport/train station, shops, restos, etc. Unbeatable! THE CON: *Only one... The hotel's renos were noisy and our windows were blocked with scaffolding. We didn't mind because we planned on waking up to conquer the day each morning, but those wanting a sleep-in during construction would have a hard time. We would definitely return to this hotel and in fact, we're plan to go back next spring to see what the final renos will look like! However, as a travel agent I must say that I might hesitate to recommend this hotel until renovations are complete. Use your discretion... If you are someone who wants good service, a beautiful renovated room in the heart of Paris, then stay here. If you want quiet mornings and a picture-perfect hotel entrance, then maybe wait a couple of months to stay here. TIPS: *Get a map from the front desk that pinpoints the hotel's specific location when you arrive. We got confused one night and got a little lost on the side streets trying to find our way back. Maybe it was the wine? :) *Ask the front desk to explain how the in-room internet works if you intend to check your Hotmail/gmail/etc. French keyboards are different than North American!

My heart sank when I turned the corner from Place de la Sorbonne and saw that the whole fa\u00e7ade of the hotel was under scaffold. When we arrived at midday on Saturday, there were still workmen in the reception area and bags of cement etc just outside the hotel. None of this was notified to us when we booked our room on-line.

Luckily, work was suspended over the rest of the weekend, but we were woken by very loud noise (an angle grinder for cutting stone) outside our window at 9am on Monday morning. So much for a lie-in before leaving for our flight! Over the next 2 hours, we saw workmen passing by on the scaffold outside our window. We were also under the impression that there was air conditioning \u2013 one would assume this would be more important than having internet access in the room?! Alas, we were told that \u201cit\u2019s coming in September!\u201d Because of the scaffold, we did not feel comfortable or secure leaving the window open while we were out. As a result, the room was stiflingly hot when we returned. Our room was decorated with black & silver fabric on the walls and black drapes. The room size was small, but typical of many in Paris. From our experience, the internet access was restricted to google and news \u2013 or maybe you have to be familiar with an iMac to get broader access? However, it was extremely slow. The bathroom was quite spacious, of a cool design and with a good shower, but a very tiny toilet. A very poor quality and minimal range of toiletries were provided. The hotel really lets itself down by only providing plastic glasses! The hotel lift (elevator) is so tiny that it should only be shared with someone with whom you are prepared to be intimate!

We stayed for one night before staying at this hotel, at Hotel Jardin de l\u2019Odeon, which is a sister hotel of the Sorbonne and a ten minute walk away. We found that area less touristy and offered much greater variety of places to eat and drink.

NEGATIVES: Miniscule rooms and baths; expensive. Lobby is tiny. No amenities such as a coffee pot in the room. Towels were small and thin. Shuttle reserved by hotel canceled on us. Stayed here Sept 27-29, 2007. This hotel is ideally located on the Left Bank, and within walking distance of a lot of places, including restaurants. It is quaint--and the size of the bathroom is almost hilarious, like a doll house (couldn't sit straight on the toilet, as it was that close to the wall--had to turn sideways!). Our room was initially on the ground level, facing the courtyard. It had the larger bathroom, and the location was very quiet. The location was also good because you didn't have to haul your suitcase up any stairs. The elevator (\"lift\") held 1 person and your suitcase. When the reservation was made by my friend, she didn't realize that a double was a 'double' bed, and not 2 beds. So, the second night, we were able to switch to another room with twin beds, but on the third floor, and with the miniscule bathroom. Lighting was so dim, it was impossible to read in your bed. The room was tiny. We arrived just before 2 p.m., and had to leave our bags in the lobby area, as the room was not ready. This hotel is considered \"budget,\" with the cost of a night being $180 (USD). That price is ridiculous, but then, it is Paris, where a cup of tea and a pastry will set you back at least $10. And an Egg McMuffin at McDonald's, with hot chocolate, will cost you more than $10, too. (The hot chocolate was good.) We had asked the hotel to reserve the shuttle to take us to the airport upon checkout. That morning, the clerk called to say the shuttle had canceled (the evening before!!) for technical reasons. This was quite upsetting to hear. After going down to the front desk, I learned there were other shuttle companies, and I had the clerk call to reserve with one of them. Why the clerk didn't do that in the first place, we will never know. One thing to know about this hotel--the street name (Victor Cousin) is also named Rue de la Sorbonne (at one end). I got disoriented coming out of the subway stop that was barely a block away, and walked around for an hour--lost! I speak some French, so was asking many shop owners where this hotel was. Not only had they never heard of it, but they didn't know the street! Had I told them \"Rue de la Sorbonne,'\" getting back to the hotel would have been much easier and faster. Be sure to get a copy of the map from the desk clerk when you go out, showing the hotel location on it--that would have helped. Location was ideal--many restaurants just a half block away, the post office was a quarter block away, and we walked to Notre Dame, the Louvre, and many other sites. There are 2 subway stations close to this hotel. There were at least 12 people trying to check out around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday morning, and it took us nearly 30 minutes to check out (precious time we hadn't planned on). I would suggest that you make arrangements the night before by checking your bill, and paying then. It will be much easier and faster if you do. If you need to get to the airport, reserve the shuttle (much cheaper than a taxi) for pick-up at least 3 hours before you need to be at the airport. I recommend this for several reasons: First, others in the shuttle may be going to a different place than you are, but which is on the way. Second, the traffic, even on a Sunday, was pretty bad. It took an hour to get to the airport. Third, if the shuttle doesn't show up on time, there is still time to order another one. Note, however, that the shuttles require 24-48 hours notice. We were lucky to be able to get the shuttle, with the help of the desk clerk explaining what had happened with the other one canceling out. Finally, do not try to take the subway to the airport if you have anything more than a small suitcase. The reason: The subways have lots of stairs, and no elevators (or if there is one, it is impossible to find). Paris is not an ADA-friendly town, and people who have difficulty with stairs or are hauling around heavy suitcases, will find the subways impossible to maneuver. (One of the subways we exited required walking up more than 70 steps in a circular pattern!!) A shuttle ride will cost about $30 one way. If I were to stay at this hotel again, I would definitely want the ground level. And I would be staying there strictly for its location to so many things.", "Date": "October 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm", "Title": "\u201cCharmed\u201d", "Author": "maraemma", "ReviewID": "UR8589210", "Content": "A friend who lived in Paris told me about the Sorbonne .

I saw the water running into the bath and did not notice water coming out of the shower attachment!!! The result - water all over the towels and my toiletries bag .

Hotel staff is kind, all the hotel looks family style - very kind overall. (But a bit narrow however :-)) Loved to stay there. Only improvement could be to make available some non-french TV channels on room TV - even for a tourist it makes sense ot see news or whatsoever in TV when get up / going to bed.", "Date": "March 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cParis stay\u201d", "Author": "Tw0Teachers", "ReviewID": "UR6842565", "Content": "The hotel is in the Sorbonne section of Paris right next to the University of Paris which is a convenient location for shopping and dining. The staff was very helpful and more than accommodating. The problem was the room. It was very small, with a tiny bathroom. We've been on cruises with larger bathrooms. The rug was old and stained, and I guess the major disappointment was the bed. Anyone can put up with a lot if you know you can retire at night in a comfortable bed after a long day of sightseeing. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The mattress had to be fifty years old, worn and lumpy. To make matters worse, the courtyard below and street noises were obnoxiously audible regardless of the time of day or night. We were awakened by yelling on two separate occasions in the wee hours of the morning. For 30 or 40 more euros per night, you can find much more suitable accommodations. We will not return to this hotel or recommend it to any of our friends, and we have informed our travel agent not to recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "February 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cFelt very welcomed\u201d", "Author": "scubaexpert", "ReviewID": "UR6834144", "Content": "Pros: Friendly staff, very clean, beautiful decor, great location, fair price Cons: Hard mattress, another pillow for comfort", "Date": "February 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cDid not live up to expectations\u201d", "Author": "Weeangelgirl", "ReviewID": "UR6820764", "Content": "My friend had stayed at this hotel and told me it was lovely so on his reccomendation I booked it.

Rooms are rather basic and yes - they are small, but we didn't mind since we came to Paris to enjoy the city and not to stay in our small room. All the staff at the reception desk was very helpful and greeted us with smile. This can't be said for the lady that serves breakfast though. The breakfast itself was a rip-off (consisting only of croissant, bread and jam along with the coffee, juice and yogurt).
