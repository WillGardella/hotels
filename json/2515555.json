The first room I was given had an unresponsive air conditioning unit, a bathtub that didn't drain well, and a bed without a blanket. At 3 a.m. I went down to the front desk to ask for a blanket and was told there were none left. So up I went to freeze for several hours underneath a thin bedspread in a fairly stuffy room. The bed was hard - felt like I was sleeping on the floor. I hated the \"upgrade\" with diner-like seats near the bed, the closet behind the TV screen, etc. The next day I was allowed to transfer to another room and was given two blankets so at least they tried to improve the situation. The second room had the same hard bed, the blankets were so thin they didn't keep me warm at night, and in this room there was almost no water pressure for the shower/bathroom sink. I was also a bit surprised that a small box of tissues wasn't provided - perhaps they should advertise that they provide a tiny bar of soap and that's it. So I'm not inclined to stay at this Motel 6 again. In their favor the area felt safe enough and the staff was pleasant and friendly.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guadalajara, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cExtremely good value.

They also had plenty of parking (although getting into some of the spots was tight). On the downside, the shower was low (I\u2019m tall) and had poor water pressure. The bathroom door was awkwardly placed, and had to be kept closed to enable passing through the room. The front desk staff was generally civil but there was sometimes an undercurrent of surliness. The most annoying event was how hot our room would be by the time we returned in the evening, the vents seemed to be blowing hot air although the heat wasn\u2019t on. The maid did seem to turn up the AC pretty high (75 or 80) but that was about the outside temperature and the room felt a lot hotter than that.

Whilst I'm grateful that the member of staff helped us move the next night to the other Motel 6 across town (after asking her to call and move us), it was still a totally unnecessary stressful situation to be placed in. This should not have happened. This is basic for a hotel website. It cost us time, money, inconvenience with moving luggage and worry. We were lucky as they had one room left. Had we left it until the morning to book, I think we would have been stuffed. Three of us crammed into a bed for the night, because we were too tired to care after a long drive. On the positive side, the room was very clean, fast (chargeable) Wifi, large range of TV channels but a little cramped. Our room was on the top floor which was away from the noise.

I was forced to buy a second room so ended up paying double. For that amount of money believe me you can stay at a much nicer hotel in San Diego. For example, The Marriott Residence Inn right down the street has better rooms, offers breakfast and a light dinner, and has a pool too. Back to motel six; they have done some renovations but the room is so small and cramped that even with 2 in it you'll feel claustrophobic. The light in the bathroom flickers constantly, and bring your own pillow. Coffee in the morning is disgusting and only had powered creamer...yuck! Theres are hard as rocks. Also the view from the room looks directly into a room about 4 feet away. Perfect for stalkers! I highly recommend that you don't stay here. I was told by the manager that the fire department allows them to put 4 people in these rooms? If they do they are creating a fire trap.

The bed on our first stay was quite good; the bed on the second stay left much to be desired - sagging in the middle and left much to be desired. Our room on the second stay was quite a bit bigger but located next to the stairwell - as a result, we heard people going up and down stairs all evening. Both of us our good sleepers, but if you are not, I'd recommend asking for a room NOT near the stairs, and one that faces the courtyard as opposed to the street. Front desk staff was helpful, depending on who was there. The bus and trolley stops were within 5 minutes walking distance, and made transportation quite easy. The Gaslamp district is only a bit farther away. We took the 992 bus to the airport - $2.50 as opposed to the $10-15 taxi fare.

The hotel is in the financial district of San Diego. It's about a 15-20 minute walk to the Gaslamp Quarter and Seaport Village. The neighbourhood is very safe and we walked pretty much everywhere. The front desk clerks were polite and helpful. The hotel offers free parking to guests. There are two large parking lots, so if the front one was full there was always plenty of room in the one to the rear. There is no breakfast available at the hotel, but complimentary coffee is available until 10am. All rooms have internal front doors. Access to the lobby is open past the front desk, but a key card is required to enter to building at night, or you have to see the night guard. The room was clean and functional. It was quite small, but not as small as other hotels we have stayed in. We booked online and paid no more than $73/night (the rate varied during our stay). The hotels nearer the Gaslamp were much more expensive.

We stayed for a couple of nights. I think we paid around $95/night. I didn't have any expectations of luxury accomodations from a Motel 6, but for the price I would have expected some of the basics which were lacking. Firstly, the location is both good and bad. It's convenient to a train stop and not far from downtown which was nice. It was also just across from the airport so you can hear planes landing all the time as well as next to another trainline which was extremely noisy. The view out of our window was of a little, trashy storage yard. The room we had could have used a good remodel. Stained carpeting, harsh flourescent lighting, hideously gaudy bedding, no door to close of the 'closet' ...everything just looked incredibly cheap. However, that said, the room did appear to be clean. My biggest complaints were the lack of really basic amenities. There was no clock in the room at all. There was no shampoo/conditioner in the room. When I called to get some, they made me walk across the parking lot at 11:00 at night to pick it up from the lobby. Only one very flat pillow per person and to echo another reviewer, the towels were like sandpaper. They could take the money they're investing in their satellite tv and put it into these things instead (who wants to sit in an unpleasant room and watch cable tv anyway?) I know it's just a Motel 6 and you get what you pay for, but I've stayed in a lot of hotel/motels of the same class/price that were a whole lot nicer. It's tolerable for a couple nights, but if you can afford to, stay somewhere else.", "Date": "January 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid, Spain", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "nek0", "ReviewID": "UR5776611", "Content": "I stayed here this summer on my road trip through California for a few days.

I didn't complain that he hit his head I just wanted a bandaid, but that wasn't allowed and couldn't be bought from the little vending machines in the laundry room either. Downtown is a horrid place to stay if there is a Paredes game. Don't even think about going to the gaslamp district in your own car because you'll just end up frustrated at the lack of parking.
