The hotel breakfast is ok with a selection of croissants and jam + coffee/tea and juice, but you can of course order things on the side. The staff at this hotel is VERY nice, service minded and professional! We felt so welcome and special and they took care of everything.

My boyfriend took me for Valentine\u2019s Day and I was very pleasantly surprised. The hotel was in an amazing location with gorgeous views of the Eiffel Tower. We arrived later in the evening so by that time it was dark but the Eiffel Tower lit up like a candle on a cake visable from the hotel. When we checked into the hotel the staff were very welcoming and friendly. Spoke very good English and were very happy to help us out with anything that we needed. They did take 100 euro deposit from us so be aware of this if you stay here as we were not aware of this but we did get it back when we checked out. As we had arrived late we were hoping to eat in the hotel\u2019s restaurant but we were informed by the reception staff that it does not open on a Monday so we went out to find some food (maccy ds just down the road!) Once in the room (classic room) we found it was very modern and stylish however very small and there were a few little things that could have been fixed before having someone stay in the room. Part of the wooden floor near the bed had become raised so we kept tripping over it on the way to the bathroom. Also the ceiling in the bathroom, part of it has started to come away but nothing that was dangerous or put us off our stay. Just something we think would have been nice to be fixed as it would put some people off staying there. The bathroom was lovely, had a very large shower and filled with courtesy Radisson products which smell gorgeous! We loved the fact they also provided dressing gowns and slippers (in the wardrobe) very comfy!The mini bar was stocked with drinks/snacks however very pricey! Unfortunately like most things in Paris! There was an iPod/iPhone doc and coffee machine in the room which was a very nice touch. Huge flat screen tv on the wall however the only channel in english was bbc news but no issue to us. We stayed for 2 nights and had breakfast both mornings (included in the price). They give you a selection of mini pastries, fruit juice and tea/coffee. Very small portions but if you do fancy something hot then you can order something from the menu which will cost an extra approx. 8-10 euros each (again small portions). We also visited the pool/steam room in the hotel which we thought was to die for! Very classy and up to date. Towels and changing rooms provided. A great way to relax after a long day walking round all the sights before going out to dinner.

It is stylish and elegant, without beeing snobby or to much of everything. It is a small hotel, but you have everything there at the same time it is intimate and personal. The restaurant is very nice, and we went there during an evening where it was full - not by hotel guest, it was by locals. Menu and food was awesome and innovative, but the big success is their staff with their service. They couldn't do more for us and our, sometimes, difficult needs and desires. The bar is a hidden gem, and promise me that you will not miss it on the first floor! Great atmosphere, beauticful drinks, friendly and classy service, and if you are lucky you can have the corner table where you can see the Eiffel Tower! The pool area had much more to offer, and when you have a deeply look it was in need of a larger renovation. It wasn't a nice area at all, in the way it looks now, but I'm sure if they work a little bit harder, it can be nice. There are some flaws around, that are not charming, and I think pretty easely can be fixed to come up to an acceptable standard. The room was a little bit worn out and the maintenance team need to have more attention, but I have to say that the decor, fabrics, design and furnitures was in all way very excellent. The room was very tiny (as the most rooms in Paris) but dos'nt had the bad, to tiny feeling. It was in all way very lovely and suprisingly it was good space for our shopping bags and a large travel luggage. Nice standard Radisson amenities, but also bathrobes and slippers as well as a Nespresso machine in standard rooms which is much appreciated. Location is perfect. Silent, but in direct access to the Eiffel Tower with a few minutes and both the Trocadero Metro Station (with direct link to Gallerie Lafayette and Printemps) and if you add a few more minutes, you can walk to Victor Hugo Metro Station with line to Montmatre. At both places you have brasseries and caf\u00e9s where you can have breakfast, specially at the Trocadero site where the view to Eiffel Tower is lovely. The are felt very safe.

We were absolutely overwhelmed by the fantastic design of the Suite and the \"to die for view\" of the magnificent Eiffel Tower. I was, however, disappointed not to find the Champagne in the room. I called the Concierge and was told that the complimentary champagne will only be available in the evening. Having a special celebration and no champagne in the room? I then ordered a bottle of Champagne via room service for \u20ac85.00. It took 30 minutes for it to be delivered to the room and it was not even the right temperature. This was most annoying to both of us as we wanted to enjoy and celebrate our very short stay in Paris. I understand from the statement of features of the Eiffel Suite that the champagne is offered on the day of arrival and not in the evening of the day of our arrival as we were then told. I was deeply disappointed at the lack of flexibility from the staff to allow the complimentary champagne to be delivered to our Suite when I enquired about it. There were no full or any mirrors other then that in the bathroom. Also,there is no provision to hang one's used towel or gown in the bathroom. The marble bathtub is impractical, too deep and narrow. Not inviting! It reminded me of the huge ceramic washbasin my mother had in the laundry room. We left the Suite for dinner and requested the room to be made up. However, on our return from dinner, we find, although the room had been made up, the empty champagne bottle/bucket with tray had not been removed. We called the one button service to have the tray collected, but there was no response and we unhappily had to place it outside the door. Looking at dirty trays down Hotel corridors is not my idea of a luxury hotel. A further disappointment was that there were no complimentary newspapers available. Throughout the night there were terrible noise coming from the \"overhead blinds\", on the outside windows. This is a design mistake and should be seen to as one is constantly waken by the banging noise. We requested the Concierge to reserve Taxis for our respective train departures. I was told there had been an accident and therefore the delay. She did however, go outside the door to hail a Taxi from the street and its 17:00 hrs by the time I finally leave the hotel. From the situation I could but assume that the Taxi was not ordered by the new shift at Reception Desk as, while I waited in the reception area, no-one informed me of any delay of my ordered Taxi. I was immensely irritated as the train was scheduled for 18:13.

It's big too with a full wine shop. GREAT selection of wine for cheap. You can go over there and get a good bottle of wine for 4 euro and order room service for 16 euro and you had a great dinner! * close to the Trocadero metro station - so you can easily get into the heart of the city * cafe's - there are a ton right there, you can sit out side and have a great view of the eiffel tower. I recommend this! * BON - walking distance for this great restaurant BON that the hotel recommended * Shower - awesome rain-can shower head * Bed - the bed was comfortable, the pillow were awesome (I want them for my house) and the linens were soft and clean. * FREE INTERNET! - this is HUGE, a lot of hotels charge $30 per day for this.

Which in itself is one of the best reward programmes I've used. We arrived early and the room wasn't ready, but they took our bags for us and we went off to explore the area. Loved the fact that opening the door of the Hotel you have a direct view of the Eiffel Tower. After some walking and the Modern Art Museum, we returned to the hotel at 3pm where we were told we'd been given an upgrade to a suite. (room 624) It's worth noting that this was a very cosy little suite with no view of the Tower but instead the side streets of Paris, this certainly wasn't a problem for us. The room was small with a large on-suite, including a black stone bath and large walk in shower. A small sitting area with Table and Nespresso maker were appreciated, although tea making facilities would have also been nice. Room service was quick and very tasty, we had Penne Pasta as main and Fromage for desert. It was a bit pricey, but seemed in line with Paris prices. All the staff were very kind and helpful to us.

I chose this hotel as it is right next to my good friend's flat (she has a new baby, so I choose to stay at hotel instead) and very near the Trocadero. I've come to Paris many times and stayed at numerous hotels but this is by far my worst experience ever..and yet, it could have been so good so easily. The first room was promising. A view of the Eiffle Tower, small but clean room, a Nespresso machine and a double shower (no bath). But while taking a nap, I was accosted by slamming of doors which did not come from neighbouring rooms but the staff service doors upstairs. It went on for more than an hour so I had to surrender and request a change of room. This request was quickly and kindly attended to. I was moved to a first floor room which was at the end of a corridor on the same floor of the hotel bar. Even though this worries me, there was no noise coming from the outside of my room. The noise this time came from the very loud air conditioning vent INSIDE my room. But, switching the air off kills the noise, so I didn't mind too much.(though it gets really warm in the night) The rest of the list of disappointment are bearable. The freezing pool, the leaky ceiling dripping cold water on me while I lay by the pool, the broken pool tile, the raised floorboard in my room that trips me everytime I come out from the bathroom, the very expensive soggy smoked salmon sandwich I ordered from room service along with the foie gras that's gone just off. Because the Concierge was always kind when getting me a taxi or making me a reservation at a busy Louvre restaurant at the very last minute, I gladly forgive all the other disappointing points. What I'm writing next, I have to be very careful as it is not a mere complaint or observation but it crosses the line to accusation. All I can say is I have been made to understand that it was my fault that I did not use the safe provided in my room and that I should learn my lesson well. The sad thing is I never heard anything from the General Manager but was visited by the HouseKeeping Manager who proceeded to scold me and somehow manage to make me feel very, very bad. (I only realised afterward that he has suceeded to bullying a 40 year old woman.) Because this was the straw that broke the camel's back, I do not recommend this hotel. I shall never stay at this hotel again. I am very saddened by my experience.

The morning after we waited 15 minutes for the taxi to come with the doorman trying to tell us that the driver was on his way.

As the taxi already was late we agreed to go in the taxi but we were afraid all the way to the airport as he speeded and almost had an accident with another car. Our advice is NOT to take the taxi this hotel will order you and my advice to you is to not go near this hotel at all.

It looks nice, feels nice. The rooms are good, modern - great bathrooms with top of the range hans grohe/axor bath brass wear, the beds are massive with big fluffy pillows. No complaints there. Location is marvellous also - with a great bar across the street to have some pre-dinner drinks. However - the staff seemed to dislike the English. When we arrived back from being out to dinner we were scornfully informed that the bar in the hotel \"It's closed - It's August? We close at 11.\" - no mention of this in the information in the rooms which delighted to tell us that we could drink with magnficent views of the Eiffel Tower until 1am. At breakfast the waiter rudely mentioned that we would be getting contintental breakfast only (presumably due to it being August again) - I loved a glass of juice, a few pastries and a cup of coffee costing 18 euros per person!

The room we got was amazing\u2026extremely clean, everything looked brand new, the washroom was gorgeous\u2026 it just made everything feel perfect!!!! The staff themselves were also well above par, extremely courteous, they were so helpful that they even gave my new bride a toothbrush at 1:00 A.M. when she realized she forgot it. On our last day just before we left, the concierge was giving us tips about Nice, and all of the surrounding areas, told the cab driver which train station we needed and overall made us feel as if we were long time clients.
