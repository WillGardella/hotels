We had arranged to meet up with our daughter and her partner in Paris to spend a week together to celebrate new year. We are just so glad that we chose to stay at the apartment as it has provided us with a home away from home. We had many enjoyable meals in the apartment and were able to relax after a long day sight seeing in the evenings. The apartment is well kept with good facilities. The bathroom is well stocked with toiletries, towels, toilet rolls, extra sets of linen and there is a computer in the lounge.

So patient, informative and helpful. They know how to treat their guests and provide the best in Parisian hospitality. I will mention one issue we had in regard to our room. It was a little warm. We shut off the value for the heat and opened up the windows, but the wind would bang them around. About the third night, I had an \"ah-ha\" moment, and we closed the black-out shutters and then barely opened them a tad, so that we could get a little more air.

We had a lovely twin room which over looked the typical French street and we had a terrific view of the Eifel Tower as well which looked great at night. The Hotel was so easy to get to from the airport - Roissy Bus, metro from Opera to Ecole Militaire and a short walk. The area the Hotel is in is very nice and it's only a short walk to the Tower and the Seine. We bought a 5 day travel pass which meant we could travel from the airport and all over Paris on bus, metro or train. We used the busses a lot just hopping from stop to stop, and the bus stops are very near the Hotel. I'd highly recommend investing in a pass - just don't lose them as I did as once they're gone, they're gone! I'd also bought a Museum pass for 2 days which in hindsight I could have done without. It was great queue jumping at the Louvre, but to get our moneys worth we tried to fit in as much as possible and probably missed out on half the Louvre. Next time I think I'd just get an advance ticket for the Louvre and spend a day in there! It's stunning but so big! The staff at the Hotel are so friendly and helpful. I loved staying there, nothing is too much trouble. There was a fridge in the room which I used to store the many bottles of wine I bought from the supermarket! All in all I loved Paris, and the French people were so friendly and helpful - especially those that helped sort out the cheapest replacement travel tickets! We went back to the airport on the train and this wasn't as good as the Roissy bus. One or two beggars, crammed to the rafters until Gare de Nord, but quite pleasant after that with musicians playing for us! Will I be back? I hope so! Will I stay at the Hotel Relais Bosquet again?

We felt a little bad that we didn't speak more French, but all of the hotel staff spoke very good English. The hotel was clean and quiet. The rooms were large for Paris standards, especially for the price. The location was absolutely perfect. It was a 10 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower and 2 blocks to the Metro Station that you could take to any place in the City. It was a great metro station location because we never had to make more than one connection to get to the sights we wanted. The restaraunts and bakeries in the area were wonderful. The breakfast at the hotel was quite good also. We loved the Rue Cler area. While we are younger, we don't enjoy the very loud, party scene. This area was perfect because, it was busy during the day, but not overwhelmingly crowded. It was quiet during the night. The restaraunts and cafes were good with good variety. The only very small negative was that the beds were a bit stiff, but we still both slept well. The one thing I would recommend is that perhaps they rotate a couple of dishes on their hot buffet. Something like quiche would have been nice once or twice a week, perhaps a special dish on Saturdays or Sundays. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone travelling to Paris.

The beds were very comfortable, and the room darkening blinds made it easy to get a good nights sleep so that we could make the most of each day.

The apartment is located on Rue du Champ de Mars in the building right next door to Le Bosquet restaurant. The apartment was cosy, spacious and well equipped.

Condiments and leftover food from other guests was also left on the bench for use, which proved very handy for us. There is an excellent artisan bakery on the corner across the road from the apartment (you'll see it when you walk back towards the hotel), which is great for picking up fresh bread and pastries for breakfast. Cheese shops, delicatessens, butchers and greengrocers are all just around the corner on Rue Cler and also on Rue Saint Dominque. There are also a couple of supermarkets and wine cellars very close by and the metro is just around the corner. The bathroom includes a washing machine and drier, as well as a bath/shower. There are two wall beds in the lounge room and a double bed in the master bedroom with adjoining courtyard. Since we were there in winter we didn't use the outdoor courtyards. We could imagine that the courtyard next to the lounge and kitchen would be a very nice spot to enjoy meals in the warmer months. There is a computer in the lounge cupboard if you need to use the internet and also free wi-fi. The apartment is cleaned and given a linen change every three days. The staff were incredibly helpful and arranged our transfer from the airport as well as booking us a table at Le Florimond for New Years Eve dinner.

I like the feel of quiet residential neighborhood and close proximity to good restaurants that lined Rue St Dominque and Rue Cler. For our 3rd visit to Paris we decided to get a nicer hotel closer to Rue Cler and after much research settled on Relais Bosquet due to the positive comments about customer service. In that regard I was not disappointed. The customer service was top notch. The front desk was very polite, and took care of business with class. Rue Cler is about 1/2 block away and the hotel is very close to the very rustic but good value Cafe du Marche. Unfortunately I did not know it at the time, but Rue Cler is a bit dead on Mondays. But during other days you can really pick up a lot of nice supplies for a picnic lunch or snack - from raw oysters to pates to fruits to cheese to bakery to chocolates to ice cream. A foodie heaven to sum. Rue St. Dominque is another street that is packed with nice shops and restaurants and about 10 minute walk away. We went to Fables de la Fountaine and Cafe Constant and they were both very good. The hotel was really 2 residential buildings transformed into a hotel. The is a hallway that connects the two on the ground floor. As a result, the elevator is miniscule (fits 2 person and 2 suitcases), and the staircase is narrow and not advisable to use. Partially due to the retrofitting, our room is a bit peculiar and a disappointment. It was a very large room by Parisian standards, and it was decorated nicely and very clean. But the toilet was in a tiny room next to the bed, and there was no sink near it. So every night we had to go through the ritual of going to the toilet, and then run across the room to go to the shower/tub/sink in the bathroom at the other end. Not fun. Lastly, the sound travels. One night on our floor, the kids (apparently in a different room) kept knocking on the door of their parent's room, looking for toothbrush and such. We could hear every word. So I will consider this hotel again because overall it was really a good hotel, but I will want to double check the layout of the room.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carbondale, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGreat find in the 7th\u201d", "Author": "ddb8", "ReviewID": "UR124296970", "Content": "My husband and I were more than pleased with the Hotel Relais Bosquet Paris (a Rick Steve's rec).

After reading reviews for this hotel and comparing them to other similar 'star rated' ones, I decided to book with Hotel Relais Bosquet and am so glad I did. Everything is excellent - the location, the accomodation, the service. To reveiwers that say they expect more for what they paid - THIS IS PARIS, of course it is abit more expensive to alot of other places. Just like visiting New York, Sydney, London: expect to pay alot more than what you'd get at 'home'. We've stayed at many Ritz Carltons and Westins, but we were still impressed with Hotel Relais Bosquet. This is a nice, small, quiet hotel in a safe, convienient location. We booked the superior room with the Eiffle view as it was our first visit to Paris and we were celebrating my birthday as well as New Years. Because we later extended by 2 days, we had to move to a no-view superior later which didnt bother us. The staff made it easy by allowing us to leave our luggage in the room and moving it for us when the 2nd room was available. We found the superior rooms to be comfortable and spacious for our short time spent in the room. It was nice having the Eiffle view but it really is no biggie as you will hardly be in the room. Also liked having a separate toilet to the shower. The 1st room had the shower head on the side of the bath which was abit arkward but nonetheless not a big deal. Superior room bathrooms are big. Housekeeping always did a good job at cleaning the room daily and replenishing toiletries and towels. Also liked that the rooms had slippers (usually only find these in 4-5 star hotels). The rooms are also equipped with a safe, blackout blinds, tea/coffee, mini fridge, iron, reading bed lights and flat screen tv (yes I found a few places with box tvs still and not all these amenities). The room also has a heater and a separate air con unit. The air con unit is however turned off during winter so if you are like my husband and still sleep with the air con on during winter, then you will have to open the windows. Luckily even during NYE celebrations, the area was still quiet at night for a sound sleep. Another plus is the free wifi you get in the room. Not readily available in public areas as you may be used to from home. Location is safe and excellent - bus stop and metro a short walk away, the Eiffle tower about 10 mins walk away and so close to many good restuarants, bakeries and shops. Service - the staff are all so excellent. All very helpful, friendly and patient, even the grave yard shift staff. You tend to be abit more 'free' whilst on holiday so it was good when theyd remind us of safety: pickpocketers, late night travel on the metro etc. They made our stay alot easier. I wish I knew all the monsieur names to mention them. It was nice knowing at the end of the day, we were returning to a quiet, comfortable, clean hotel with friendly staff in a safe, convenient location - we will definitely stay here again.

The hotel has a great location with bakeries, cafes, cheese shops, pizzerias, etc. nearby. It is a charming area to walk, as it lies within blocks of Champs de Mars/Eiffel Tower/Trocadero. The staff speaks English well, and are quite helpful and polite. The room (standard double) is comfortable, if not roomy. The only problem is that the beds are 'pushed together' and tend to separate. The elevator seems fairly new and is fast. The stairs are spiral and not easy to climb, as the steps are narrow.

We planned our own trip, bought our own tickets (air and rail), and, with advice from friends (local and those good advisors on TripAdvisor) made our own hotel reservations. The Relais Bosquet was excellent in every way. (We did choose the deluxe - or larger - room size and glad of it.) We managed to see many of the museums and churches we had wanted to see. And we did take a day trip to Giverny - easy and worth doing. We also enjoyed walking around and dining in the Rue Cler area (where the Relais Bosquet was located). Our only difficulty was with the travel in country, and if I'd asked more advice from Trip Advisor, I probably would have spared us some anxiety (I didn't know how to find the right rail car when we took the train from Paris to Avignon, for example.) We managed the local transportation well. The buses are convenient and we used them quite a bit. Taxis are expensive, but we used them a good bit, as well, since my wife has knee and foot problems. We usually had very little trouble getting cabs - and only one really surly cabbie. We took a very expensive dinner cruise on the Seine. Next time, I would skip the dinner cruise and take a late afternoon/early evening cruise so to see the sights better and to see the lights come on. Dinner was excellent, but detracted from the sightseeing. We did take in a concert at St. Chappelle - a beautiful church/stained glass. Worth doing! We rented a car in Avignon and drove to St. Remy - a charming town. We stayed at L'Amanderie in St. Remy when we were in Avignon. It is not nearly as fancy as Relais Bosquet, but it was quite adequate. The hotel Trip Advisor recommended in St. Remy was full, which is why we stayed where we did; next time I'd try to stay right in downtown St. Remy - lots of very good restaurants. A HIGH POINT of our trip was hiring a tour guide for an all day excursion around Provence. Our guide was Laurent Catoni (<allprovence@gmail.com>). He picked us up in his van at 9 am and dropped us off back at our hotel at 6:30 p.m. We saw, among other things, the Pont du Gard, Avignon (center city, Pope's Palace, etc), Rousillon, a paper mill on a river which produced 'hand-made' paper from old cloth - a wonderful day. Laurent is very pleasant, knowledgeable, and accommodating. His English is excellent. We could not have seen and done all we did in Provence without him. We did manage on our own to tour Arles and we also found an olive grove and press business driving around on our own and had a tour of the whole place. A GPS in the car made that all quite easy.

Three stood out in particular: Bruno (usually at night) who was very kind and very quickly got us ice at the mere mention of it (merci encore!), the gentleman (aux lunettes) usually there in daytime whose name I didn't get (sorry monsieur!) and the young man in the kitchen area who always went out of his way to acknowledge us and wish us a good day. Housekeeping did an exceptional job daily. The Superior room we stayed in was wonderful. Spacious (plenty of room for 2 adults), quiet, clean and newly renovated. Air conditioned with a big, comfortable bed. We slept very well every night. We used the in-room fridge and kettle and greatly appreciated the complimentary coffee and tea. The bathroom was perfect, separate toilet, double sinks with vanity shelf, full bath and shower and very clean. Housekeeping was great and refreshed our towels even when they really could have lasted another day - that was very kind and appreciated. The location was all we could have wanted. Less than 2 minutes down the street to Rue Cler, 10 minutes to the Eiffel Tower and under 5 to the Ecole Militaire metro station, and quite an easy walk. The area was quiet and safe, we walked at night without a care and enjoyed the beauty of it in the day. Right at the intersection of the hotel's street and rue Cler are a grocery store, a patisserie and the Caf\u00e9 du March\u00e9 restaurant - all very good and at decent prices. A word about costs - be prepared to spend more than you think you will on just about everything in Paris, compared to Canadian standards. It can be a costly trip if you don't try to find the more economical choices. That said, you are in the most beautiful and magical city in the world, so enjoy it! We can't comment on the breakfast as we had our own each day in our room - happily purchased the night before at the Leader Price grocery store on the corner. Yogurt and cereal is our standard and the room's fridge made it easy to do. Do try the italian restaurant Del Angelo at 6 avenue Rapp - it's not too pricey and delicious. About an 8 minute walk from the hotel on the way to the Eiffel Tower. Make sure to stroll down rue de Grenelle and rue Saint Dominique - lots of shops and food stops. Overall, a real value for the money and we can't say enough about the Relais Bosquet. We did a lot of research before booking our hotel and were very pleased with our choice. We would like to thank previous reviewers on TripAdvisor for their honest and accurate descriptions of this hotel. You helped us choose it and we are very glad we did.

I have visited Paris twice before, but this is the longest I have stayed in the city. We really enjoyed this boutique hotel. There is just something neat about a small hotel with personalized service! My husband and I arrived from London on the Eurostar and were able to check into our hotel in the afternoon. It was a quick walk from the Metro, but be prepared to haul your luggage! As for the hotel, we stayed in a Superior Room on the 2nd floor (one flight of stairs). Room 11. The room was spacious enough for my husband and I and had a view of the courtyard in between the two buildings. The bathroom has a separate room for the toilet and was spacious enough for two people to move around. Being Rick Steve's readers, we were given breakfast each morning and it was very good. My husband enjoyed the coffee and the breakfast was filling. My only recommendation would be a rotation of items offered. The same food was a bit monotonous after the third day. However, there were a few goodies that we were able to toss in our bags as snacks to get us through the day. Many thanks to the staff for the breakfast each morning! The staff was very nice, spoke English and French. I tried my best to use my four years of French from college, but it had been a few years, so they were patient with me. Room 11 isn't the easiest to say in French!! As for location, we LOVED it! We were very close to great markets with fresh bread, crepes, patisseries and restaurants. We were repeat visitors to a restaurant about two blocks away that offered outdoor seating and caulk board menus. We also enjoyed our walk over to the Eiffel Tower in the evenings and for sunrise on my birthday. Spectacular! I would recommend this hotel to any of my friends that have the money to stay here.

We were lucky enough to spend 10 nights in Paris and due to TripAdvisor reviews we booked this hotel for our entire stay. Since our stay was 10 nights, we made sure to book the largest room. Well unfortunately that room was very tight for our 3 suitcases and bags. There is just enough room to walk around the bed to the toilet which is not actually located in the same room as the sink and shower. Now, I do know that is very common in France but to Americans to walk across the room to wash your hands is a bit unappealing. Yes, the room darkening shades are a nice feature but there are some draw backs. You can sleep forever and not know what time it is unless you set your alarm clock (who wants to do on vacation!). And when you do sleep in later housekeeping keeps knocking on the door and actually once opened the door even though we had the privacy sign out. Lastly, you cannot control your own room temperature so when you close the room darkening shades no more fresh air is coming in and the room was very stuffy. Also, we did not find the bed comfortable. I continued to wake up with a bad back. We did pay for the breakfast and wish we did not. It was just breads, with no toaster, and some cheese and cold eggs. We did go to the cafe next door which had many pastries but can be a bit too heavy to have day after day. On to location. Yes it is great to be close the Eiffel Tower which we walked to frequently. In addition, we loved the restaurant Tribeca right around the corner. The waitstaff was great and food delicious. We went a few times!! The hotel is also close to Rue Saint Dominique which is a great avenue (has a Starbucks when you just need a little taste of home). A plus was free internet and good connection! However, since I had not been to France before we did not understand how important Left Bank and Right Bank position was. We were daily crossing over to the Right Bank where the Champs d'Elysee, Opera, Arc di Triomphe, and Sacre Couer are. So after four nights in this hotel we decided later in the day it was time to make a move to a hotel room that was larger, with a better bed, a more American style bathroom, individual room temp control, room service, American style breakfast, and most importantly, a location of the right bank. Since we were leaving later in the day we did get charged for another night since we did not give 24hrs notice but we did appreciate the staff not charging us the full price or the days we did not have breakfast, We were also packing so quickly that we forgot a few items in the desk and the staff thankfully held on to them for us! So when it comes down to it. Staff was great and helpful and for 10nights in Paris we needed a room that had some room! and on the Right Bank.

Walking 10 min to Eiffel ower, sceine river and a very safe upscale area one block from Rue Cler . The staff is exceptional and remember your requests and promptly take care of it. A must if this is your first time in Paris , is to arrange for the hotel to send, Ali the private driver, to meet you at the airport. It is worth the $75 euro for having a person meet you at the exit of baggage with your name on a sign, and navigate you thru the airport and take you to the hotel . He narrates the city along the way in perfect English. You can take a Taxi for $55 Euro back to the Airport. But, really a good value for less stress having someone meet you at the airport. Safer too. Frederika was outstanding at the hotel. She was always smiling and the staff were happy. Al the staff were terrific and speak fluent English. Very friendly. My husband made an email request for flowers to be in the room for my birthday. It was perfect! A dozen pink roses in a vase waiting for me. The room is good size by Europe standards. Very clean, great linens and large bath towels. High end soap and shampoo. Get the breakfast in the morning. It was delicious. Linen tables, pretty tea and coffee cups. Quality meets, cheese, outstanding bread, coffee tea, eggs. It was so good to wake up and go to breakfast in the hotel as it saved time looking for a place each morning. We needed to get early starts to the attractions that open generally at 9AM. here is a small refrigerator in the room. hairdryer and a separate water closet (toilet) . Get the supreme room for only a few euro more. It is bigger and very quiet hotel. Beds are quite firm but comfortable. When we return to Paris, this is the only place we would stay. What a great location. Close to Metro, bus and RER (Train stations) . The cost of transportation in Paris is outstanding and reasonable. The hotel is good value and we were 100% satisfied. Thank you to the other travelers before us, who posted their experience as this helped us to make the decision to book this hotel. Side note: Paris really is a friendly place to visit. We had heard that the people in paris were rude. I truly believe if you are a happy friendly and polite person, you get back what you give. I now understand that being polite when asking for something is to say please first then ask for what you want.....in America we say thank you at the end of a request, but in Paris, the people and the children are so polity. They are respectful of each other and the children say excuse me and thank you when asking for something. I had a wonderful experience at a bus stop. The bus we were on came to the end of the line and everyone had to get off and wait 5 min for the next bus. A very nice women waiting next to me smiled and I did too. SHe asked if I spoke French, I said very little and asked her if she spoke English. She said no, but tried to communicate that is was a beautiful sun today. Now the next bus arrives and our tickets should have transferred to continue on the next bus without paying. When the next bus came and we got on , the driver wanted to charge again. She saw we did not understand that we did not have to pay and she spoke in french to the driver to help us out telling him we don't have to pay. It was a transfer. That was the best experience ever.

Cons: The double bed was two single beds put together and questionable method in regards to leaving/picking up in lobby. I will go into more detail about this subject later in my review. In a little more detail of my 3 night/4 day stay at Hotel Relais Bosquet Paris: Upon arrival, we were welcomed and greeted by a friendly staff. We arrived early, but the room was ready to go. As you may already know or have read, a lot of the hotels/apartments/etc are generally small in comparison to what we are used to in the states, but my girlfriend and I found that Hotel Relais Bosquet Paris accommodations, in regards to size, was more than enough. Large double bed (two (2) single beds put together), large and spacious shower/bath and bathroom sink. Hair dyer, iron, television (with several stations in many different languages), mini bar, and electric shade to cover the bright sun from those days you want to lounge around. After you receive your key, you'll have been told by the staff that they would appreciate (and it would be ideal) if you dropped off your key every time you decide to depart from the hotel. While I understand that this is probably for security reasons and to make our experiences more personal with the Hotel Relais Bosquet Paris staff, but there were times when I arrived at the hotel and asked for my room key (from a staff member who I have never seen there) and they just gave it to me. No questions about who I was and such. Now I understand that this would be acceptable if the person I had given my key to was there, but I had never seen this staff member before and he was more than willing to just give me my key. Maybe there is something behind the scenes that I didn't know about that helped them identify us and our rooms, but it made me feel a little uncomfortable at the idea anyone could ask for my room key and get it. Hopefully, the manager/owner of Hotel Relais Bosquet Paris will read my review and address this to clear up any confusion/misunderstandings I have. As far as location, this hotel is perfectly located (in my opinion). While it is not in central Paris, it is only a short walk (~2-5 minutes) to the Ecole Militare metro stop. There are a number of restaurants near by, which all vary in cuisine (French, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, and more). Don't want to eat out all the time? There is a small, quiet grocery store just a few buildings down from your hotel. Is that closed? Doesn't have what you're looking for? There is a larger grocery store right near the Ecole Militare metro stop. Need money? There are several banks nearby including Bank of America's sister bank, BNP, which is great for those who bank with BoA. No international fee of 1%-3% every time you withdraw money (ideal way of getting money -- don't use those conversion places unless it's an emergency). Also, the Eiffel Tower and the nearby park is a very short (~5 minute) walk away. It was nice to step out of the hotel, step into the bakery at the corner and buy a baguette from the friendly of Boulangerie Artisanale, and then take a stroll in the park towards the Eiffel Tower. Sit down and just admire the beautiful monument at night or just people watch during the day. Don't forget to leave time to visit the Rue Cler that's right around the corner. Many cafes, restaurants, little shops (bookstores, shoes, chocolate, macaroons, jewelery, etc), and much more. Busy throughout the week, except Mondays where it is a little slower. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to visit Paris in the near future. Not only do you have easy access to the metro stop (order a \"carnet\" if you plan on using it often), but you get to experience a more Parisian lifestyle (aside from being in a hotel). If you have any questions regarding nearby attractions or anything else about the hotel, feel free to drop me a message.

The hotel is located what is for me the best and handiest place in Paris, safe, quiet and very well located, metro station right around the corner, the Eiffel tower just a 10 min walk, and around the corner a pedestrian street full of small shops and a supermarket with gorgeous food, and lots of restaurants to chose from. The breakfast is lovely and well worth the 13\u20ac, lots of different bits to choose from (the mini Pain of chocolat and mini baggettes are to die for!) if something I missed was proper coffe, not mad into that filtered americano style coffee. Will I come back...

The front desk spoke excellent English and was quite helpful to me on numerous occasions. There were 2 terminals in the front lobby providing free internet access on a first-come basis. In addition there was a mini-library of various travel guides for Paris. We also received 2 tickets for a 1 hour boat cruise on the Seine as part of the room package. We purchased one week passes on the Metro and having the Ecole Militaire station so close was very convenient.

The front desk staff were really helpful, spoke perfect English and were obviously interested that we enjoyed our stay. There was also free wi-fi which worked perfectly and a programmable safe and a small fridge in the room. That summarizes the 'pros'. The only real 'con' was the housekeeping. We were quite late leaving the room each day, but I had to chase down towel and toilet paper one night and the following day, the bare minimum was done - trash emptied and beds made but again short one towel. This may be a result of us leaving after noon each day. However on the second to last day, a housekeeping manager came by to check on the room so it appears the hotel is aware of the problem there and is working on it. As I said already, the room was clean, just not stocked. Also, buy your snacks and water etc., as there are many stores in the area to purchase snacks, including healthy ones, and water, wine, beer etc. The prices for these items through the honor bar system border on the ridiculous by North American standards. The real plus point of this hotel is the location as it is half a block from one of the most interesting streets in Paris, namely the Rue Cler. On that street there are many good restaurants, fresh fruit/veg shops, a pharmacy, clothing shops etc. The best coffee in our opinion was at the one crepe shop - we went every morning! Big cups of cafe au lait!

We chose the hotel after extensively researching the areas of Paris and reading hundreds of reviews on tripadvisor. Well, the Hotel is in between the Invalides and the Eiffel Tower; we actually walked all the way to Notre Dame as well (slow pace in under one hour, with several stops for pictures). The area is really nice (I wish I could afford to live there...). Rue de Champs de Mars has a few shops, a lovely bakery just one or two doors away from the hotel, a small supermarket abot 10 meters up the road, and a fascinating cheese shop opposite it. Pass the supermarket and you cross Rue Cler: packed with little restaurants, bars, a greengrocer and whatever you could wish for. The staff at the hotel were always polite, helpful and pleasant. Our room was fine for what we needed (I don't think we managed to spend more than 6-7 hours in a row in there!), with a wardrobe, table, TV, coffee and tea, kettle. The mattress was very comfortable (better than mine at home, according to husband!), and the room also has electric blinds, so even if you are a bit light-sensitive you can get a good sleep. On our arrival we also found a very handy map of Paris on the table, with all the landmarks clarly marked: a very thoughtful touch. The bathroom was spotless and every day it was replenished of shower gel, body lotion. They also provide a sewing kit, a shoe polisher, a nail file and a little vanity kit (make-up remover pads and cotton buds). The fridge was big enough to contain the bottles of water we bought, and more food can be stored in there. There was a safe, and the bedroom was on the inside courtyard, so we had the view of a tree in front of us. Metro stations: Ecole Militaire about three minutes away, Invalides about ten minutes. We ate in three different restaurants nearby, but the one we preferred was the Italian (Di Felice in Rue Grenelle): and that's saying something, as I am Italian and I don't normally enjoy italian food abroad... The area feels very safe, we never felt we had to look over our shoulders, not even walking around late at night. It is a brilliant location also as far as getting to it from CDG. Just get the blue line RER, stopt at St. Michel-Notre Dame, change to the yellow line RER, stop at the Invalides and get the lilac metro to Ecole Militaire. One hour and you are there. I am now trying to plan my second visit to Paris, and I will certainly be staying at the Relais Bosquet again!

It is in the 6th, walking distance from the Eiffel Tower, Les Invalides, the Seine etc and surrounded by great little restaurants and quirky Parisian shops. It is a few metres from Rue Cler (food street!) and a short walk to the Metro which gives you access to all of Paris. Next door is a wonderful bakery. The morning queues tell you how good it is. If you want to go a little further afield there are some classy restaurants in the 8th. We ate at the Tante Marguerite, a Bernard Loiseau restaurant in Rue Bourgogne. Good food and good value for money. A tip for shoppers, and who can go to Paris and not shop? The French Post Office provides a wonderful service to send goods back home and reduce the weight of your luggage. Airlines can be very unforgiving. For around 40 Euros you can send 7 kilos by air anywhere in the world. Smaller packages are less. This includes a self sealing box which you pick up at the Post Office.

Its a lovely experience to sit at one of the cafes in the later afternoon (Tribeca was one I enjoyed) and watch the locals collect their children from what must be a nearby school. The shuttle to the airport was late arriving and the gentleman on reception quickly made a phone call when I mentioned to him this fact. I appreciated his quick response.

The apartment is on the 4th floor of a quiet apartment building built around a courtyard. There is a miniscule, one person elevator to get your luggage up the stairs (or you if you need), and the kids got a kick out of that.

The apartment itself is well-appointed, modern, and true to how it looks on the web. There is no view per se, but the many windows look out onto an inner courtyard and neighboring roofs. The kitchen could be better stocked with cooking utensils and service items, but it was adequate for what we needed. The shower and toilet are in separate rooms, which is handy if you have more than one person staying with you. Somehow they fixed the flat screen television to provide English speaking cable channels for us, and although we didn't watch much TV, it was nice to hear the news on CNN in English.

By the way, we got to the Hotel really easily from Charlle De Gaulle Airport - just got the RER train to St Michel Notre Dame, and then connected to another RER train to Pont D'Alma. Only cost 8.50 Euros each (just got ticket from machines at airport). Really easy - only took about 45 mins in total. From Pont D'Alma it was a ten minute easy walk to the hotel, basically just down one main road. Hotel staff were all very friendly and spoke great English. Christian helped me with booking a Dinner Cruise and Moulin Rouge show. All top notch service! We stayed in a superior room, and it was massive. Could see the top of the Eiffel Tower from our room too. As others have said, Rue Cler is just a 2 mind walk from the hotel, with lots of cafes/shops/restaurants. The Metro is a 5 min walk, base of Eiffel Tower around 10 min walk. Seine/Dinner cruises 10 min walk. How great a location is that?

Great loacation, spotlessly clean, fantastic facilities and very friendly and helpfull staff.

Checked in at 12pm no problem at all ( unlike the London hotel we stayed at the night before where we were charged \u00a310 extra to check in before 3.30pm). Room was just as the hotel's own website shows and was very pleased when i opened the window to see we had a view of the tower ( room 24). I was going to update our room to superior on arrival but, after seeing our standard room i could see no point in the upgrade even though it is a relatively small charge. Great bathroom with bath and shower, lost of little extras like tissues, flannels,shoe shining kit, sowing kit, shower caps, body lotion and shower gell. Breakfast served in the room was a great idea 10 Euros for the continental delivered to your room at a time of your choosing has to be a bargain. The street is pretty quiet ( as is the whole area ) but with the electric blackout blind down its both silent and dark until you chose to open up in the morning. Hotel is within an easy walk of the Eiffel and the river ( i highly recommend using the Batobus Hop on Hop off service (just down the steps to the river at the back of the tower, bought a 2 day pass for 16 Euros ( 5 day for 19Euros) and used it all day every day) great views so relaxing and saved a fortune in taxis. Bars cafe shops and restaurants all around the hotel and streets nearby so you cant be stuck for somewhere to eat or drink but i would recommend, on a warm evening, pack a picnic with bottle of wine and get off the Batobus at the Jardin des Plantes to enjoy the locals in free music and dancing ( or maybe just watch the dancing like me) its a beautiful way to spend an evening and it will only cost you a few Euros if you shop at one of the supermarkets near the Hotel Relais Bosquet . This was our first visit to Paris and i have to say it was fantastic and cant wait to visit again.

I knew how Dorothy felt when she said, \"We're not in Kansas anymore, Toto.\" We booked our 7-night stay using the hotel's website and received a prompt response confirming our reservation. I emailed the hotel a week before we arrived to get info on day trips, etc, and received prompt responses and assistance setting up all the outings we requested, as well as a transfer from the airport. Our room was just like the pictures on the webite. By US standards the room was small, but we had plenty of room. There was a small dresser and armoire to hang clothing in plus a bench to store our suitcases; one on, one under. The bed was very comfortable and I miss the feather pillows. If you're tall, the bed may be short, but we had no complaints. The room staff kept everything neat and clean, with fresh towels and bathroom accessories daily. Our room, #54, was in the main building right on the street. There is a lot of traffic noise and nightlife, but with the window closed we couldn't hear a thing. We usually left the window open and didn't mind the noise - it was all part of the Paris experience. The few times we had the window closed, we used the a/c which worked wonderfully. There is a breakfast buffet available with a wonderful selection of breads, eggs, cold and warm meats, cheeses, fruit, cereal, yogurt, coffee, juices and the best butter we'd ever tasted. If you have the Rick Steves Paris 2009 book, as we did, breakfast is free (usually 15E per person). The front desk staff were friendly and helpful and very quick to speak English when our French left something to be desired. I do miss the friendly \"bon jour\" and \"bon soir\" we heard from them every day. I still have the urge to say it to strangers, just for the fun of it. The hotel location is wonderful and very safe. We were less than a minute away from two major bus stops and 5 minutes tops to the L'Ecole Militaire metro station. We found ourselves out walking late at night with no concerns for safety. The Rue Cler is about 1 block from the hotel with a wonderful bakery and several great restaurant options and is busy with locals and tourists alike. There is also a bakery next door with delicious baguettes, but I preferred Changement de Direction on the Rue Cler; their pastries were to die for and they gladly boxed several up for us to bring home on the plane. It made leaving Paris slightly less painful. By the time we left, we felt like we were leaving our favorite neighborhood.

We wanted to spend a few days in Paris so I booked 4 days here using Travelocity. Part of the reason I picked this hotel was the recommendation of the Hotel Valadon front desk (# 12 on Trip Advisor) because it was full. Also the price seemed reasonable, $130 Euros for 2 twin beds. The location was great, we walked to the Eiffel Tower, to Musee D'orsay, to the Louvre, Hotel Invalides and really just all over. There are great restaurants everywhere, we walked to Rue St. Dominique for dinner twice. Rue Cler market street is just around the corner and it was awesome. Exactly what you envision Paris will be like. The staff was cordial but not friendly, and not overly helpful. I needed batteries and asked if the store across the street would have any and they told me no. What they didn't tell me was 5 addresses down was a Fran Prix market that had batteries and everything else you might need. When we needed to get to Roland Garros I asked the best method - taxi or metro. They recommended a taxi and called one for us. It cost 15 euros to get there and we could not find one to bring us home. We had to walk to a hotel a mile from Roland Garros and have them call us a taxi. Two days later when we had more tickets we decided to try the metro. The station was close to our hotel and took us straight to the stadium and cost us 1.60 euros each, quite a savings. Again, maybe they thought we were too dumb to figure it out on our own, but I was unhappy with their lack of guidance. Breakfast was adequate but expensive, 15 euros each for croissants, eggs, coffee and a fruit cup. It was advertised as 15 euros per room, but they insisited on charging us 15 each. We took advantage of the boulangerie on the corner and the Fran Prix to get our own breakfast after the first morning. Our view was a narrow courtyard and everyone else's window. That didn't really bother us. The beds however where too small for my 6 foot son and his feet hung over the end. He didn't sleep well while we were there. I guess upgrading to double beds may have been necessary for someone his size. The bathroom was very nice with nice toiletries, the towels were very large, but somewhat rough. They had free wi-fi which was very nice, our previous hotel charged for wi-fi. Bottom line, great location, clean rooms, nice bathroom, pleasant lobby, buy your breakfast elsewhere, don't get the twin beds if you're tall, and don't expect the staff to be overly helpful.

They arranged a Yellow Van to meet us at the CDG airport (36E for two) and then reserved a return trip shuttle for our departure as well. They gave easy-to-follow directions for taking buses and metro and literally saved us hundreds of euros for our day trip to Versailles with directions on how to take the right train. The room was very clean with fresh linens and towels every day; the electric room darkening shades were a plus for late afternoon power naps. It was also lovely to have an electric \"hot pot\" for having tea or coffee in the room. Although some travellers may have been put off or inconvenienced by the on-going renovation to the lobby, we left early each day and returned early each evening so experienced very little inconvenience to mention. Nonetheless, the staff offered us an additional discount on our room and the one day we could not use the elevator, provided us with a complimentary bottle of champagne! We were about a 15-minute walk from the Eiffel Tower (which we could partially see from our room #33!) and an equal distance to Des Invalides in the opposite direction. The markets and cafes of Rue Cler were less than a block from our door. Served from 7-11am, the breakfast is quite adequate with eggs, sausage, ham, fruit, juice, coffee/tea, yogurt, breads and cereals. (Ask for the \"Rick Steves discount\" to have this included as a complimentary breakfast ). Go early for a clean tablecloth! For ordering on-line, we also had our choice of a free pair of tickets: the Louvre or Andy Warhol exhibit. We strongly recommend purchasing the Museum Pass...we stayed a week and purchased the 4-day pass which included Versailles and most major sites.

It is a pity that all the outdoor eating is really off limits if you aren't a smoker. The hotel itself is somewhat tired in the public areas and there are plans to redo it sometime in the future. I was initially put off by the amount of dust on the carpet in the halls and am surprised it hasn't been noted in any review. We had a superior room in the courtyard which we requested.and it was very clean. It was a good size with lots of storage, two large windows in the bedroom and one in the bathroom and very quiet in terms of noise from the outside. While smoking is permitted there was no hint of smoke.The windows were always left open by the cleaning staff and the room felt fresh and airy. The bathroom had a big tub and shower which was great and double sinks with lots of counter space and there was always hot water. It is also great if you have to rinse out clothes and hang them up since there are racks that work really well. The one drawback was the toilet which was in a separate room but it was across the room from the bathroom and felt very closed in. It was beside the bed and the sound of flushing from other rooms could be heard. The breakfast was ample and the staff serving it excellent.

The rooms were a nice size with a hallway and a closet to store things such as suitcases out of the way. The rooms had a mini bar which could also fit in a few things that you had purchased at the grocery. They also had free wi fi in the rooms which was so easy to use. Even the Hilton is paris charges over $30 for wi fi for one night. This came in very handy as my wallet was pickpocketed from my zipped purse when we arrived on our first metro ride. My advice for ladies is not to be dumb like me and leave that purse it home. We are Rick STeve's readers so we requested the free breakfast. Rick Steves has advice for paris that more than pays for his book. This hotel was part of that. Free breakfast for a family of 6 is worth about $75 US a day. The location was excellent. There was a grocery called Franix (I believe) within steps of the hotel so we could stock up on food for our back pack to eat while we were out.

They helped us locate a lost piece of luggage, gave us maps and directions, recommended restaurants, and were able to book a last minute shuttle to the airport.

It's within a 10-15 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower, less than 5 minute walk to the Metro, and a block away from a street that features a permanent farmer's market.

Free wireless internet. We are from Silicon Valley and love our technology. Free internet is always good. The bad: Beds are hard.

Skip breakfast at the hotel and go to the corner cafe to get a chocolate croissant (see above... yum). Our room had no view at all.

Furthermore the hotel is only 10-15 minutes walk to the Seine and 2 minutes from Rue St.Dominique, with its good restaurants, boulangeries and shoe shops, that leads you down to the Boulevard St Germain with its upscale swanky shopping options. The hotel rooms are nicely decorated, clean and spacious, and ours, though it was on the top floor in the attic, didnt have a restrictive ceiling height. Our room had a plasma screen with satellite channels and a partial view of the Eiffel Tower (the tower's lights flash for 10 minutes on each hour during the night!) and a well stocked mini bar and tea/coffee facilities. The bathroom was clean and bright, with lush white fluffy towels provided, with the only mini-gripe being that the water pressure in the shower was rather low.

I was grateful for the effort made by the staff to get me into our room very early. Cab fare from Charles De Gaulle during morning rush hour was approximately \u00a335. Room #45 is a standard room and for the most part it resembled the photo on the hotel's website. It was snug but not as small as some of the European rooms I've stayed in; we had no problem stashing our luggage out of the way. The view of the Eiffel Tower and the Rue du Champs de Mars, decorated for Christmas, was picture postcard pretty. The window was outfitted with an electric shutter which came in handy when we wanted to block out the noise from the street below. The room contained two small twin beds pushed together, a wooden wardrobe which stored an iron and ironing board and extra blankets, a small desk and chair, a mini bar with plenty of space to store our own water and snacks, and a working safe. Everything was clean and well presented. The bathroom was small but equipped with a full bath/shower and the standard ameneties. The towels were large and decent quality and there was plenty of hot water and good water pressure at all times. One of the nicer things on offer is the use of the free internet access in the lobby. If you've never pecked out an e-mail on a French keyboard, (I hadn't), prepare to be amused. The hotel sits in a charming neighborhood with a range of good cafes, bars and restaurants nearby. The Cafe Champs de Mars, just doors down from the hotel, was the perfect spot for a late meal after a night of pub crawling in Le Marais. The metro station and post office are within easy walking distance. The hotel staff both at reception and housekeeping are accomodating, friendly and professional. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel so I can't comment on the food service. We enjoyed so many things about this wonderful little hotel but we did have one rather significant problem...we found the beds to be extremely uncomfortable. We loved the location, the price, the staff, the view, so many things...but we didn't sleep well. At the end of the day a good night's rest is the most important aspect of any hotel.

We stayed at Hotel Relais Bosquet, a three-star hotel in the 7th district. You can really see the difference a few dollars makes when upgrading to a three-star from our usual two-star hotel. Our room was a record setting size, complete with electric shutters to block out the street noise and lights. Wow! We had a view of the Eiffel Tower from our room. Three blocks left from the hotel is the Champ de Mars Parc, with the Ecole Militaire complex on one end and Le Tour Eiffel at the other. One block right of the hotel is the Rue Cler, once a bustling street market and now just as full of trendy cafes. Breakfast was 13 Euros extra, so we went down two doors to the Boulangerie Artisanale, where we were well satisfied with quiches, chocolate croissants and baguettes. We toured the Le Orangerie museum, which has recently reopened with an entire floor of Monet\u2019s water lilies painted on circular walls. While we were in Paris, the city had fans from all over the world for World Cup Rugby (Coupe du Monde 2007). The best group was the Scotsman, who all wore their kilts to show their national pride.

There are so many sites that are well within walming distance of the Relais Bosquet that its location is superb. If you get a chance, ask for a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower. It's trivial, but looking at your window to see the top of the tower leaves you with a memory yo won't soon forget. If you are a Rick Steves customer, tell the hotel. I mentioned that I discovered the hotel through Steves and they indicated that the continental breakfast was free for Steves' readers. Frederique, one of the clerks at the front desk, is incredibly friendly and helpful. Don't hesitate to ask her for help with getting a taxi, etc... A tip: if you are planning to visit museums in Paris, consider getting a museum pass. The hotel can arrange for this pass to be delivered to the hotel and waiting for you when you arrive, and it will allow you to by-pass lines that can sometimes be fairly lengthy.

The rooms have a full bathroom which is quite a nice size with full tub and shower with handheld shower head. The rooms are a nice size as well.

The housekeeping was great at cleaning even though when we ran out of toilet paper they forgot to restock. Also on checkout they tried to charge for 3 mini bar items, which we did not eat/drink. They took it off the bill. Breakfast is not worth the 13 euros they charge. You get free coffee, tea in your room already. For 13 euros they pretty much give you coffee, tea, juice, and a basket of breads. The fruit was just a few small pieces of cantaloupe, nothing special. This is not worth the cost. at all. Their site mentions this breakfast as an option: \"Drink only: freshly-squeezed orange juice, a hot drink, a madeleine and a croissant.\" but that was never mentioned to us or offered. We never got any croissants from the hotel even with the 13 euros breakfast. Save your money and run down the street and buy croissants yourself or go out to a little cafe and get crepes!

We got to the hotel by Yellow Van which was arranged for us through the Hotel. This worked very well and made the transfer easy. You could have got here by a combination of the Roissy bus and Metro 8 but it would have involved hauling bags up and down quite a number of stairs. All in all, the van worked well and was not expensive. The front desk staff were extraordinarily helpful and pleasant. They speak excellent English and are happy to help you with suggestions, reservations and advice on request. Check in and out was efficient with no surprises. The front lobby has a computer to access the internet. It has a different keyboard than the one that we use in Canada but, with some considerable patience, you can get used to it. It is often used by guests but is generally available with a short wait. The hotel has wireless internet and so bringing a lap top would be a good idea. Ice is obtained through the front desk and isn't available on each floor which was fine as far as we were concerned. We had a superior room which was very nice. Had to insert the room \"key\" into a slot by the door to make the lights work, which was a new one for us and not something that came to us immediately. It had a large bathroom with two sinks and a large and effective shower. A separate WC was within the room. The air conditioning worked well, thank goodness! The safe was inside the small fridge (which wasn't the first place that we looked for it). The fridge has enough room to store soda, cheese, meat, and other stuff if you wish. They do stock it with the usual which we didn't use. They have a coffee maker in the room that we didn't use. There was a small TV which had 3 English channels plus a number of other channels. There was a large cabinet and a chest of drawers for clothes which was adequate. Electronically closing blinds completely darken the room and completely keep out outside noise. One could hear the doors open and close in adjacent hotel rooms. Breakfast was included in our package and was very good. It consisted of orange juice and \"cake\" to start, followed by coffee and heated milk, chocoate bread (addictive), croissants (very good) and additional bread with an assortment of jams and butter. Cheese came with it as did some cut up melon. This was one filling breakfast that was very good. We never were able to eat all of it and it pretty much filled you up until supper time cutting the costs of lunch (generally you might just need a drink and could share a salad and that would do you the rest of the day). I am sure that you could go out to a local bakery etc and it would be fine, but this was so convenient and so good! The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the Eiffel tower and two blocks from the Metro. It is one block from Rue Cler. There are two bakeries nearby and two grocery stores as well. Banking was within two blocks. I highly suggest the Le Bosquet restaurant nearby as it has great service and food. Cafe du March is also close and is a little cheaper with reasonable food and a fun atmosphere. You can get a crepe on Rue Cler that is the equivalent of a full meal. Wine shops abound nearby.

The hotel is a few minutes walk from the Ecole Militaire metro (line 8) and bus #69 stops nearby (great route - Invalides, Musee D'Orsay, Louvre, near Notre Dame and Marais) and a few mintues from bus stop #92 (Arch de Triomphe and Gare Montparnasse (we went to the latter to catch a train for Chartres). We used the buses a lot as the routes were so direct and it gave us a chance to see more of Paris but they can be hot in warm weather - no air conditioning! The staff at the hotel were efficient and friendly - both the front desk staff and Barbara who serves a nicely presented continental breakfast with yummy fresh strawberries. The hotel also has free internet in the lobby. The room has an iron, hair dryer, wine glasses and wine opener and coffe/tea maker. One thing to watch for - if the hotel calls a taxi for you, the charge will start from the time the cab leaves the taxi stand. We got a taxi to the airport and when it arrived there was already about 9.70 euros on the meter. This is not the case if you flag down a cab on the street. We were glad we choose this area of Paris as other areas like the Marais seemed so crowded and it was nice to come back to the green boulevards and see the Eiffel Tower, especially lit up at night. We had a wonderful time in Paris and would definetely come back to the Relais Bosquet and not hestiate to recommend it.", "Date": "April 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in a great district!\u201d", "Author": "AllAboutParis", "ReviewID": "UR7380147", "Content": "We found this hotel from Rick Steve's Paris guide 2007.

The apt's half a block from the hotel on a very quiet street on the ground level. It's lovely decorated with a outdoor patio. Unfortunately, we didn't get much use of the patio due to the weather condition in November. The size was more than adequate and amenities were better than expected with the DVD and CD players. We didn't stay in one of the hotel rooms and therefore unable to comment on the quality of the room. My impression from the lobby was that the d\u00e9cor was a little outdated and didn't look well maintained. I did like the fact that there's a PC/internet available for guest use. The location of the apt/hotel was excellent; just one block away from the Tour Eiffel. The neighborhood is mainly residential, quiet and upscale. I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking to stay at a place that's busy and happening. Most of the shops close early in this area. The front desk staff offered adequate service for a 3-star hotel. With that said, I\u2019d like to command the hotel staff on their professional and courteous way of handling problems. We encountered a problem with the apt lock upon check-out. One of the keys was stuck in the lock and we were unable to open the door. The hotel manager and staff calmly helped us check out and allowed us to leave for airport. We were told that the deposit would probably have to be forfeited if the hotel incurred costs in fixing the situation. I was not optimistic that I would be able to get much of the deposit back. However, the hotel emailed me after a couple days and let me know the cost was 30 euros. I was relieved to learn that it wasn\u2019t a costly problem and the hotel staff handled it promptly and kept us informed. I\u2019d go for a hotel if it\u2019s your first time in Paris and prefer to join tours and visit the city in a well-planned out way. I\u2019d recommend the apartment to experienced travelers who are adventurous and willing to find their ways around Paris.

I needn't have worried! The room, while cozy, was plenty large enough for the two of us and our two big suitcases (+ carry on backpack and shoulder bag). We didn't feel like we were stepping all over each other, or our luggage. The room had an armoire where we could hang some of our clothes, iron and ironing board, those wonderful electric darkness blinds, and a very functional bathroom with hairdryer and nice toiletries. Oh, and there was also a safe and mini-fridge. You could buy items from the mini-bar, but it also came in handy for us to store our own sodas/water. Just walk a few steps to the right of the hotel's front door, to the grocery store there, and buy Coke or Evian for something like 2.50-3.00 Euros for a 6 pack of either. The front desk staff was always warm and helpful, and housekeeping was excellent. I do recommend that you tip the housekeeper each day - it's apparently the norm in Europe, and you'll get much better service if you do it each day instead of waiting until the end of your stay. I generally left 2-3 Euros a night, and in return, got extra toiletries and towels, a spotlessly clean room, AND I wasn't charged for the 2 drinks we actually did take from the mini-bar before realizing we could just walk to the grocery store. We really enjoyed using the free internet on the computer in the breakfast room. I was able to check in with friends and family, and also get info about some of the tourist sites we wanted to visit later in our trip. The carpet and furniture in the lobby and in the halls is slightly worn, but we didn't mind at all. For the price and location, this hotel is a GEM. As for location, you couldn't ask for better. We spent some time in the Latin Quarter at night, and it was bustling and noisy even late at night. We really loved coming \"home\" to our little section of Paris, where it was peaceful and not as crowded. At the same time, it was soooo easy to get from our location in the 7th to anywhere else in Paris. For one, Paris is incredibly walk-able. Second, the Ecole Militaire metro stop is an easy 3 minutes or so away. I was a bit intimidated to try using the metro on our first day, but it really was easy, and we ended up using it multiple times a day, zipping all over Paris with ease. Finally, the location can't be beat for restaurants. The 7th is full of lovely little bistros that are moderately priced (23-30 Euros per person for a delicious multi-course prix fixe meal).

My friend and I arrived in Paris on a rainy Sunday afternoon. We had reserved a room for four nights at a nearby hotel that turned out to be nothing like what was represented on the hotel's website on in \"France for Dummies\". We called back to the US and had my husband check TripAdvisor for some other hotels in the same neighborhood. With three hotel names in hand, we wandered out in the rain and happily found the Hotel Relais-Bosquet just two blocks away. We walked into the lobby, looking quite soggy and miserable, and inquired if they had a room available. The man at the front desk was so kind and polite when we explained that we had a reservation at another hotel but the room was unsatisfactory. He said he had a room we could have for two nights but then we would have to change to a different room. We were more than happy to change rooms since we did not have a reservation. The desk clerk then asked us if we would like to see the room. It was lovely -- spacious, clean and beautifully decorated. We immediately went back to the other hotel, checked out and returned to the Relais-Bosquet with our luggage. As soon as we walked up to the desk, the clerk told us that he had found a room that we could have for all four nights. We checked in and went to the room. While it was a bit smaller than the first room, it was still very comfortable and spacious. The bathroom was very spacious as well and spotlessly clean. We had drawer space, armoire space and lots of shelf space in the bathroom. After getting settled in our room, we went to the lobby to check our e-mail since we hadn't been near a computer in a week. We asked the desk clerk if he could recommend a restaurant for dinner. He told us that many places were closed on Sunday and especially this particularly Sunday because Monday was May 1, a national holiday. He said, \"Let me see if I can get a reservation for you.\" He called several places and did arrange reservations for dinner at a very nice, reasonably priced restaurant about 10 mins. away. This was the beginning of a beautiful friendship between us and the people at the front desk. Every single one of them was so polite and helpful. They made reservations for us for all types of things and kept us apprised of when the museums were open, the best times to visit different sites, etc. We enjoyed the breakfast every morning we were there.

The hotel charges 6.5 euros/person additional for a standard, uninspiring continental breakfast, which is served in their lobby.

Just don't eat at 'Le Bosquet'. You can't go wrong with the Cafe du Marche. Both a short walk from the hotel.", "Date": "January 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westport, CT", "Title": "\u201cIncredible city, wonderful hotel...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2905897", "Content": "My wife and I had the pleasure of spending 4 nights here in July 2004, and couldn't have been happier. It was my first visit to Paris, and the location in the Rue Cler neighborhood was superb. Quaint shops, great cafes and bistros EVERYWHERE you turn, and only a couple blocks from the Metro. We even had a view of the Eiffel Tower! Our room was very clean and comfortable, the bathrooms were modern and spotless, and the air conditioning was a lifesaver in the summertime. Also, the elevator, roughly the size of a telephone booth, is both fun and a real welcome to Europe. We laughed for hours! For only 105 euro, it's hard to beat The Relais Bosquet. The staff was helpful and friendly, as were all the Parisians we spoke with. Can't wait to go back, and will definately recommend this hotel to others.", "Date": "December 20, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cGreat Neighborhood, Great View\u201d", "Author": "Historiana", "ReviewID": "UR2848509", "Content": "A friendly staff for a small hotel in Paris.

Wonderful neighborhood with plenty of restaurants within walking distance & convenient to a metro stop. Too many Americans but the charming neighborhood makes up for it.

It was everything Trip Advisor had promised from prior guests and their testimonials. After an overnight flight we arrived and found our room ready. The bath was spotlessly clean. The bedroom had a very comfortable king with air cond., refrig, retractable blinds, and nicely decorated. However, no closet, and a somewhat awkward cabinet for clothes. Room was very quiet. Gerard and others at the front desk were very friendly, gracious, and accomodating. The Rue Cler market and neigborhood is wonderful..... hotel is just a block away from the Ecole Militaire metro stop.
