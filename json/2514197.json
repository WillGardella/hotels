I am from a developing country (Brazil), and I\u00b4ve never seen in my country such a bad place to stay on. It is as SHAME that the New York department of something-related-matter did not close down this place. I\u00b4ve booked a room at this tourist trap in 2000 through my travel agent, and I regretted the most when I came from 42th street station and found this awful, dreadful hotel. The red-and-blue carpet in the entrance was smelling bad, the room was dirty and noisy, the window did not have a lock, the bathroom was terrible. I cannot believe that such a hole still exists in a beautiful city like New York.

When I was finished, we stroke conversation. Bottom line: we got to be friends and hanged out in Manhattan for over a week. They were from Germany. I am from Argentina.

I stayed there on my second visit to New York a few years ago but after two horrendous nights checked out and, thanks to a friendly, sympathetic New Yorker, found somewhere equally central, inexpensive, spotlessly clean and welcoming (Portland Square Hotel - stay there instead!) The lift at The Aladdin wouldn't work so we had to climb up 5 flights of stone stairs with heavy cases. The room had 2 army-style camp beds with one sheet, one thin, rough, brown blanket and one pillow. All the bedding was disgusting and during the night some strange guy just walked into our room - had some kind of communal key to all rooms! I spent the remainder of the night sitting against the door, too worried to sleep. The hotel isn't just for tourists it also houses permanent NYC residents who appear to be deranged. A door down the corridor had a hand-written sign on it saying \"Anyone Who Knocks Dies\" with a picture of a gun and a skull. The communal shower-room (used by both sexes)seemed to be shared between about 10 rooms and was the worst case scenario of overflowing toilets / blocked plugs so you had to paddle through brown water to get to a sink. The reception are obviously used to complaints because when you complain they just shrug / don't react. Apart from one guy at reception, no staff spoke English - had to communicate through sign-language! Another reviewer has written it would be better to stay at the station - I said so myself at the time! I love travelling and have stayed happily in very basic youth hostels / budget hotels and wasn't expecting The Ritz. I was hoping The Aladdin would be a clean, functional base from which to explore New York - literally somewhere to sleep and wash. You can't sleep or wash there - it's dangerous and disgusting - the kind of place you dread going back to. New York is fantastic - one of the best cities in the world - don't let The Aladdin ruin it for you.", "Date": "October 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3276438", "Content": "Myself and my friend stayed here in summer 2001 whilst at uni - perhaps because we were students then, and didn't expect much, we weren't disappointed.

Had booked a couple of nights here as part of my round the world trip. We had arrived from the UK and this was our first destination of the year. I agree with a previous poster,,, if you expect nothing then you are not disappointed - after all this is only a short distance from 42nd Street in the heart of New York and was very Cheap!!! My only concern was that my son was very excited and started to jump on the bed, the window sill was at the same level and I had visions of him plummeting to the concrete pavement six floors below. So I did what all mums would do in that situation, shut the window, told him not to jump and took care of it. If I could have afforded the Hilton then I would have spent more time in the room - but we were in New York and there was loads to do. When you have exhausted yourself after a full day, had a shower to wash of the grime of the city who cares!! p.s.

Elevator worked very bad and we walked up and down (we were at 5th floor) for making phone calls to friends who were helping us finding a better hotel.
