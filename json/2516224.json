Despite our reservations regarding the change the lady on the phone assured us it was only a name change and was the same hotel - the Redwood Inn. We checked in late at night and were directed round the back of the hotel which was dark, dingy and closed off and not viewable from the road - a great place to do a drug deal I would imagine. There was a very sketchy guy with his hood up, smoking and lingering for about half an hour walking between the front doors of the rooms out the back. The front desk could not be viewed from this area and if you got into trouble you would be fairly screwed. It did not feel safe. The room was small, there was gum stuck on the headboard, the TV was ancient, the bathroom had cracked tiles, the counter top was wafer thin and the fridge froze our milk overnight so we couldn't have our own breakfast.

(by the way, the motel controls the A/C, you have no control over room temperature). Regarding the smoke smell, if it wasn't so disgusting it would be comical since you're required to sign a release stating that if you smoke in the room, you're subject to a $250.00 cleaning fee!?! The carpet was dirty, so dirty that when you stepped in the shower, your feet left black marks on the shower floor! The next word I\u2019ll use as a descriptor will be THIN, applicable to a number of items. 1st, the walls were paper thin. You could hear the television and conversations in the adjoining rooms. 2nd, the pillows were terribly old and thin, hard as a rock. 3rd, the floors for the rooms on the 2nd floor provided absolutely no sound insulation (you guessed it, thin again!). You could hear every step someone took above you as well as toilets flushing. 4th, the towels were so thin you could almost see through them. 5th, last but not least, the mattress was very hard and thin.

The first room we got had a broken refrigerator, and we had strawberries and wine we wanted to chill, but we just talked to reception and they switched us over, no questions asked. Our new room had some issues - the AC was extremely cold and we had no way of turning it down, and we did find a crazy big bug inside the bed cover (which we determined was NOT a bed bug, although it freaked us out at first, and it was already dead when we found it) - but we decided that since we weren't going to be spending that much time inside, we'd just deal with it. We slept well in our quiet room and enjoyed the pool, which was big enough to swim laps - the perfect way to unwind at the end of our day wine tasting and riding bikes in St. Helena. The breakfasts every morning were just right: a variety of bagels, jams and cream cheese, cereals of multiple varieties, apples and oranges, oatmeal and tea, milk, coffee and juice. The hotel is also in an unbeatable location - practically equidistant from St. Helena and Sonoma, within 15 minutes' drive of downtown Napa, and less than 5 minutes from Trader Joe's, where we stocked up on all our picnic supplies the morning of our bike ride.

There were a lot of other local hotel/motels but not with the convenience of online booking. I think anyone should be able to find a cheaper place by making a round of phone calls. My room was pretty generic. I could not find a personal safe or lock box in my room. The heater was tricky to use. It seems to turn it on, the knob turns all the way to right and runs until someone turns it back all the way to the left and a bit to right and then the left again. It was a little difficult. Breakfast was simple, some cereal, apples, pastries, and such. There's no place to sit for breakfast, so either eat it standing up, or bring it back to the room. The pool was closed when I was there. Temporarily? It was raining a bit. The vent in the bathroom echoes to other rooms. So I could hear other people when they talk loudly. It's also pretty easy to guess when my neighbor's toilets go off. Turning on the fan helps privacy a lot. There's a bunch of local businesses nearby, including several nearby supermarkets and domino's. So you'll never go hungry here. One complaint, it's nowhere near downtown, in case you wanted to walk to a bar. By car, it is only 10 minutes away if you have a designated driver. There's also a Massage Envy across the street if you wanted to spoil yourself. The television only picks up a few channels. Some of the listed channels seem to be dead, leaving you staring at a black screen. No adult channels. The lady gave me a passcode of wifi access, but I don't use the internet when I travel.

First of all, the room was absolutely filthy. There were stains all over the carpet, the sheets, the blanket (white, crusty ones I might add...), and the mattress. In fact, the mattresses were falling apart, and big sheets of fabric that lined the bottoms of them (yes both beds) were actually laying on the floor under the bed because they had rotted away. The mattresses were so stained that it almost looked as if they'd been in a flood or something. When we closed the door to the room, there was a large gap between the wall and the door. The shower had no latch, so when used, the shower door hung open about 6 inches and water sprayed all over the floor. The towels were very thin, and about as big as two hand towels put together.

She rolled her eyes and said \"It's going to be one of those days huh?\" I asked if there could be an adjustment to our bill considering the flea infestation. She went to get the manager, who proceeded to YELL at me!!! She hinted that I was a liar, and was making up a story so I could get a discount. She was very, very nasty. I stayed calm and told her that I had heard excellent things about the hotel, but felt that if she was going to yell at her customers and call me a liar regarding a very real problem that I was trying to call to her attention, that I felt it was my duty to spread the word about my experience.
