This is an ideal place for those people who will not have a car. The Old Town Transit Station is less than 5 minutes walk away. From there you can get the trolleys and buses. They're fast, convenient and good value. I love that this place, which has always been great, doesn't rest on it's laurels. They constantly make improvements, which although small, really make a difference. All this and their really genuinely helpful and friendly staff, are what makes me come back everytime I'm in San Diego.

We were not driving - when making initial enquiries we asked about travelling from the hotel to Sea World,San Diego Zoo and the Safari Park and were told it is located within easy reach of these as the transit station is across the road. Not being familiar with San Diego this sounded perfect. It wasn't - the hotel is not located in an area that lends itself to walking - to be frank it is not a salubrious area - when I walked in the early evening to the liquor store to buy milk I was offered a lift by a dodgy character. Travelling on public transport from the hotel was problematic - while the transit station - trolleys and MTS buses is a 5 minute walk across the highway - the wait for buses was long and even longer and very frustrating if trying to make connections - on the weekends the 150 bus the hotel had recommended taking did not even operate - we wasted a lot of holiday time waiting for transport - we did not make the Safari park which was 2 1/2 hour trip to get to by public transport from the hotel - we ended up taking taxis to get around which were quit blocks away to buy supplies - it sold very basic provisions - we really needed a car to get further afield to a proper supermarket so our kitchen was not utilised. Another disappointment was the free wi fi which did not work from our room -staff told us that iPads were a problem with their system and their tech support told me to call Apple as there was probably something wrong with my iPad.

We had a nice breakfast every morning with the complimentary spread in the breakfast room and tea, coffee and water are available until 11pm.

She was extremely knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. We arrived a little bit early and she immediately radioed housekeeping to see if our room was ready, pointed out coffee,tea and water in the lobby and movies we would be able to borrow at no cost. She also pointed out the fact that we could purchase discount tickets to the San Diego Zoo from the Inn and provided us with a map of the area. We never would have known she was \"in training\" except that it was on her badge - she is clearly beyond this. The room was very clean, the grounds well taken care of. The bathroom was nicely partitioned off from the rest of the room. The sink area was seperate form the toilet and shower area, which also had another sink in there as well. The pool, although small would be ample enough to cool off and for kids to have some fun. We didn't get to enjoy it because the weather was cool. The breakfast each morning was adequate. Nothing fancy but a good start to the day. The individual in charge of replenishing everything was a hard worker and really hustled - all with a smile on her face. The only drawbacks, the reasons for a four rating and not a five, were traffic noise, location and a strangely low shower head. The traffic noise was easily fixed by turning on the fan in our room - the white noise silenced the traffic. Not a big deal but if white noise doesn't work for you... The location was kind of strange but not bad. If you are planning on driving to see things not a big deal. We actually preferred this to staying in busy downtown. The shower head was placed extremely low. I am 5'4\" and it was tough for me. Again, not really a deal breaker but if you are really tall....

It was difficult to keep the room at a pleasant temperature due to the humidity which seemed to be in large part due to poor ventilation in the bathroom.

There was a laundry facility near the pool which we did use, and everything worked well (though the PacMan machine ate some of my coins!) The breakfast was great, and again, a lot of attention was paid to keeping the room stocked and clean. There was one front desk worker who was there in the late afternoons who was not particularly pleasant, but our interactions with her were limited enough to not have to bring it to the attention of anyone else.

I paid for the upgraded room, maybe they should have an upgraded TV. Noise is a problem. Not in the room with the windows closed and the a/c running, but still a problem. The highways, the sirens, the planes and the helicopters, maide sitting out by the pool headache producing. And the pool. There was one lonely child who wanted to swim.

It ticks all of the boxes: great room with full kitchen, nice swimming pool, free continental breakfast, great location with good transportation links, and friendly staff. The hotel's location is a bit unusual, right on Pacific Highway. It's surrounded by commercial property but it doesn't feel hemmed in. But this location is advantageous too. It's a very short walk to the Old Town transportation hub, convenient both for buses, trains, and trams. We traveled by Amtrak and the Pacific Surfliner sometimes stops at Old Town Station, which is even more convenient to get to the hotel. At the other side of the transport station is historic Old Town, which was a delight to visit -- all of this is within walking distance of the hotel. In reading some of the reviews we were concerned about accessing the hotel by foot when it's right on the highway, but this wasn't a problem at all -- there are traffic lights to safely cross the highway and get over to the transport station. Our room was very nice; large and complete with a full kitchen. You can request a full set of cooking supplies for free, if you want to make some meals in your room. The hotel also has DVD players in the rooms, and you can freely borrow from a large selection of DVD's in the hotel lobby. Our kids also enjoyed the pool, which is large and a nice temperature. No hot tub, unfortunately. The continental breakfast is also nice -- fruits, cereals, pastries, toast, as well as a couple of waffle makers which is always a family favorite. The staff were great; very helpful when we had requests or needed assistance. I can hardly think of a negative thing about this hotel; for our family it was perfect and it made for a lovely stay in San Diego.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cA Great Place To Stay!!\u201d", "Author": "Amy C", "ReviewID": "UR121251444", "Content": "I tried to give 4 1/2 stars but it wouldn't let me!

As with most hotels there were pluses and minuses but at the Old Town Inn the pluses outweighed the minuses by quite a bit. The bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable, so comfortable that I found myself looking for the brand in case I wanted to buy the same for at home. We walked to Old Town and it was quite close and seemed safe enough. Breakfast was complimentary and was pretty good. The pool was a bit small but sufficient and I hardly ever saw anyone else there. There was free wi-fi service and it worked well and although not lightning fast it was more than sufficient for just web searching. The bathroom was also seperate from the the sink area which was a nice setup and provided a bit extra space. The major negative to the hotel is that the walls seemed thin and we could hear our neighbors talking and hear their tv as if there was a party next door. It wasn't terrible but I would imagine this wouldn't sit well with some people. Our tv also had \"issues\" and didn't always work correctly and was also set up to be watched from the couch in the room and was difficult to see from the bed. I moved the armoire it was in so it could be viewed from the bed which easily solved that issue. Overall the Old Town Inn was a nice hotel and nicer than other hotels in the same price range.

I really wanted to rate it higher, as the staff and management seem to try hard to make it right, but some of the minus keep bugging me. Here are the pluses. - First, the hotel has some of the best rates for its location. Few properties that I researched would sell rooms for its rate (about $130 for a 2 Queen deluxe suites, less if you are AAA member) that is so close to most of San Diego's major attractions. The rate includes parking, internet (well, limited) and breakfast - a continental breakfast with packed pastries/bagels, waffle machine, and boiled eggs. Breakfast is pretty decent. Items were constantly refilled, and we found no issues finding a place to sit (hotel was fairly full during our stay, judging from the occupance of the parking lot). With respect to rates, if you are an AAA member, make sure you mention that during your reservation. It is likely that the whoever is handling your reservation will ask if you are an AAA member (a plus, a hotel that offers a discounted rate on the phone). Also, the AAA rate is not mentioned in the hotel website, and the published rates do not reflect the 10% AAA discount. According the the front desk agent, what you should do is to make a note that you are a AAA member in the comments field of your online reservation. Or call in person, they are quite friendly. - The rooms are quite clean and comfortable. Well appointed and functional. I would say they tend to be on the smaller side (the deluxe 2 Queen, I mean) but it worked for our family of four. The vanity area is separated from the bathroom which is a plus. AC is an under-window unit, a bit noisy, but it works pretty well. The room had also a tv and a dvd unit, where you can check movies at the front desk. - The hotel is nicely landscaped, and the pool area, although small, is pretty nice. Another plus is the lobby, where you can help yourself with coffee and water the whole day. It also has a computer and a printer station. It is actually a nice area to hang around, and there were even some board games that you can check and play (chess, scrabble), which is what actually excited my 8-year boy quite a bit. - I believe that the best feature of this property is the location. It is actually close to everything that matters in San Diego. It is walking distance to Old Town San Diego. It is less than 10 minute drive from SeaWorld - and you don't need to hope into the freeway to get to SeaWorld, which is a plus to save some rush hour traffic. The same holds for downtown, Gaslamp quarter, marina, and Balboa park. It was a 10 minutes drive to the beaches and 20 minutes drive to La Jolla. Actually, location is one of the major reason we chose to stay at the Old Town Inn, since its proximity to SeaWorld allowed us to leave the park late afternoon so our kids could have a brief nap and we could enjoy some dinner outside the park, before heading back to watch the night shows, which we found was well worth it. Also within the location topic, there are plenty of dining options right near the property (we had thai in a mall nearby), although I think it would a bit too far to simply walk. - I should also note that the staff works pretty hard to make it right. They are quite friendly. I wasn't aware of the AAA discount until the second day of our stay. When I mentioned that, the front desk agent automatically gave us discount for the remaining nights - I didn't even need to ask (bring your AAA card, though). The morning helper was also very friendly in giving us information and directions. Now some minuses - The first, I would like to say that the Old Town Inn is basically an old motel that has received a nice face lift, furnishings, and landscapting to look it nice. It is successfully most of time. However, there are times that you are reminded that this is an old motel under the facade, for example, when you hear the sound of the pumbling in action early in the morning, and you know nobody is using the bathroom. We were on the first floor, so perhaps this factor is magnified. Nevertheless, it does highlight that this is an older property. - The property is quite small (which is good and bad), and so is their parking lot. To be fair, we haven't had any parking issue, even arriving late, and the hotel was fairly full. But it does give that feeling of being crowded, not to mention the need to do some maneuvering to fit into some spaces. - The location is great, but the immediate surrounding area is kinda iffy. I did not feel unsafe in the area (it is just desert, with an industrial feeling, and only runs for a block or two) but I would not stroll around outside the motel after dinner. Still, it is perfectly safe to walk during the day, as a lot of people do. - In room internet is free, but ... Well, it seems that the hotel does not have a large bandwidth, and if you do try to download something, the server will block your mac address permanently. I don't if that is what happened to us, but I was not able to access the internet after my wife used the computer, and she said the only thing she was looking was CNN. Maybe we were blocked for some accidental news streaming, I don't know. It was a bit of an annoyance, although I was able to remedy by using the lobby computer. At the end, the free perk was not actually free. - Finally, my biggest quibble is with the noise. From our room, we had an unobstructed view of an elevated portion of a freeway and, hence, the noise had an unobstructed path to our room. The noise actually arrived in the form of \"white noise\", but very audible. Again, it may be that our room magnified the conditions (rooms facing other directions may not be in the direct path of the noise). I also believe that the gaps between the door and the door frame (which were relatively wide) may have to do with it (sounds seem to flowing through these gaps), meaning that it may be possible to ameliorate the situation by narrowing those gaps. There were also other noises adding to the symphony, including airplanes and the aforementioned toilet flush from the upstairs neighbors. In all fairness, I should mention that I only noticed these sounds early in the morning - evenings were quite ok. Also, wife had less issues with noise - and she is the light sleeper. Also, to be clear, these issues were not deal breakers, otherwise I would not have given a 4 star rating. However, they were reminders that this actually an old motel underneath the nice facade. I thought that overall the hotel provides an excellent (probably the best) value for your money, considering its ammenities and location. It has a friendly, accommodating staff that works really hard to make it right. However, it does have issues, like noise and crowding, that keep reminding me of its old motel facet. As I said, my sentiments for its rating swings from 3.0 to 4.5, averaging 3.75, so that's why I finally decided to rate it at 4.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cI never knew it was there!

I noticed it was about 15 minutes before check in time of 3pm but the woman at the front desk didn't mention it and was very friendly and delightful when she checked my girlfriend and I in. We stayed in the economy room with the queen size bed. It's a very tiny room with enough space for a small table and couple chairs, two night stands and a tv stand. Large closet though with ironing board and iron and a small coffee maker on the vanity. The bathroom was so tiny that there was only room for a standing shower. We did go into the pool, it was small and heated, better than most motel pools I've seen. The breakfast was great, I love waffles and I got to make my own. There was also juice and milk, cereal, donuts, coffee, bagels and cream cheese and danishes and fruit salad. For being a free breakfast I was pleasantly surprised at how much was offered. I also liked that we didn't have to pay for parking. This, the price of the hotel and the free breakfast and being near Old Town is what sold me. Granted the area isn't the best since it seems to be right in the middle of an industrial area but I didn't have any problems with seeing homeless people or street walkers loitering around the area like some of the other reviewers said. But what really made this stay even better was the kind and friendly service people. My fiance forgot her engagement ring on the bed and realized it AFTER we checked out and AFTER we'd already started our Old Town walking adventure. The woman at the front desk didn't give us a hassle when we asked to go back into the room because we forgot \"something\" and as my fiance was running full speed back to the room we just past the housekeeping lady that had actually found the ring and was giving it to the woman at the front. Thank you Old Town Inn for a great stay.

As I checked every where we had stayed previously, I found they were either sold out or their rates had ridiculously increased. When searching web sites, I kept seeing reviews of the Old Town Inn. When I checked the prices, I was skeptical about the lower prices that went along with the great reviews. I also couldn't get a good feeling for what the area was like. But I was getting desperate and \"went for it\" When I called for the reservation, the person I spoke with (sorry I am terrible wth names) was one of the most positive customer service people I have ever spoken with. She treated me like I was the most important person she was taking care of. She was informative, knowledgeable, gracious and personable. I had to call the night before and ask if the room would hold one more adult, who decided to come with us at the last minute. The person I spoke to then said there was a fold out couch that could be slept on, but also stated it might not be as comfortable as a bed. There would be a minimal added charge for the third person. I had a comfortable feeling about this place after speaking to these people on the phone. Upon arrival, (easy to find), the desk person was happy to see us and once again very personable. She explained everything thoroughly, informed us of times for breakfast and sincerely seemed to care about our stay. Once we got to our room, it was just more reinforcement that we had made the correct choice in staying there. We had a large room with a two burner stove, sink, fridge and microwave and lots of kitchen type cupboards. The couch was comfortable for sleeping.They also delivered a plastic tub of kitchen utensils, pots, pans and dishes for us to use. The bathroom vanity/sink was separate from the shower and toilet. Nice nightstands, chest of drawers and desk No problems receiving internet. Beautiful landscapes, everything well kept up and no bad smells anywhere. Breakfast had many items, though I would have liked some additional protein choices (yogurt). Lots of carbs. Juice ws NOT watered down. Attendant kept all items well stocked, no matter the time. There were movies and board games you could check out, always coffee, tea in he office lounge. Washer and dryer. The heated pool was nicely landscaped with many chairs. Would have liked a hot tub.

That means no netflix, no YouTube, no updating apps, no downloading, etc. Only basic web browsing and small emails. 4. Dodgy neighbourhood. We had a man linger about outside our room, peer through the windows, and even knock on our door to ask to speak to a fake person. We called front desk and they escorted him from the property. Also, you're only seconds from psych facilities and there are numerous homeless around because of the proximity of health and human services, the central transport depot, etc. 5.

We did not have a rental car, so were reliant on public transport, but if you have a car, there is free parking. When we checked in (at 10 AM!) the front desk people gave us lots of information on the area, including a guide to getting around by public transport, with tips on how to get to local attractions, grocery store, beaches and more. Very helpful! The closest grocery store is just a couple of bus stops away. There are also tons of other stores (Target and such) as well as a lot of fast food in that area. Super close if you have a car and very accessible by bus as well. We spent our first two nights in the one bedroom suite. There was so much space in this suite- we loved it!

We also enjoyed the ability to check out DVDs- a great end to our busy days in San Diego. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious- heavy on the carbs, but still good. Coffee, tea, and water are available all day in the lobby as well. If you need to do laundry, there are a couple of coin-operated machines near the lobby. We especially appreciated this, when traveling with little kids. The hotel was quiet and we slept well all of the nights that we were there.

The room was nothing fancy, pretty basic, but they do have some ammenities which make it standout. They let u check out dvds as well as games from the lobby. This was great for my daughter who I played a game of jenga with and watched shrek before bed... Also the location is within walking distance to old town, which is one of our favorite attractions in SD. also the breakfast was pretty decent. Bagels, waffles, hard boiled eggs, toast, fruit, oatmeal, cereal, coffee, juice... Other than that I did notice the pool which we did not have time to jump in..plus I noticed they have an arcade game down by the lobby which was pretty interesting. The front desk lady was also very polite so no issue there.

With a AAA discount we stayed a Sat nite for $ 100 in a room that was very clean and had all the amenities we needed. The beds were very tidy and comfortable, and although the room wasn't large it didn't feel cramped, and was laid out very efficiently. Particularly useful was that there sinks in different areas so that both of us could get ready at the same time without interfering with each other. Noise levels were quite good too. Staff at the front desk and in the breakfast room were very friendly and helpful. They gave us good guidance on attractions, and sold us Zoo tickets for a slight discount ($ 4 off regular price). That saved standing in line to get tickets at the Zoo. Of course, considering the price there are some compromises to make when staying at Old Town Inn. One is that there is no restaurant or bar on site. Another is that there are no tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, groceries/drugstores in walking distance. You can't get into Old Town itself (despite the name) because you have to cross a 4 lane highway.. However, the location is very central for reaching San Diego's main attractions by car (Zoo, Midway, Botanical Gardens, Old Town, Coronado, Petco Park, Gaslight area, LaJolla etc). All within 15-20 minutes drive. The only other downside is the lack of an exercise facility although they do have a nice swimming pool. They don't have a separate \"Business Center\" room but they do have a computer and printer in an area near the front desk so that you can run off boarding passes and/or maps. Given all that, Old Town Inn would not be an ideal place for an extended stay because of its lack of certain amenities and the inability to easily walk out and get them nearby (like a restaurant or bar).. On the other hand, for a quick 1-2 night stay where you don't plan to spend much time at the hotel and only want clean, efficient, pleasantly decorated rooms , helpful service, and a convenient location for driving to points in San Diego at a very reasonable price, this place can't be beat....", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cYou won't find a better value\u201d", "Author": "belwah1", "ReviewID": "UR99946748", "Content": "This is our third year of staying here.

I stayed at less than half the rate of a hotel within walking distance to the SDCC and even with the SDCC parking ($10). The OTI is slightly less than 10 minute drive on surface streets to the CC and about 2 blocks to Old Town San Diego. The neighborhood looks iffy mostly because it appears to be largely industrial rather than commercial or residential \u2026 also the trash, the liquor stores, and the wandering homeless. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t stay here without a vehicle because there isn\u2019t anything besides Old Town I would want to walk to. The property however stand out all the more because of the environs \u2013 it is well kept and well lit. Plenty of parking right in front of the rooms. Access to San Diego is good since it is located right on Pacific Highway which leads straight to the harbor and downtown. The other way is the Sports Arena area where there are quite a few restaurants, shops, lumber store, etc and of course the Sports Arena. It is a little awkward getting to the motel from Pacific Highway since it is a south bound one way so if you are coming north up Pacific you probably want to turn left at Kurtz then right on Rosecrans and right again on Pacific. The airport is really close but not so close so as you are bothered by the sounds of aircraft. The motel is at the junction of the 5 and the 8 Freeways. If you\u2019re interested take a look at the management response of September 20, 2010 \u2013 gives a little bit of history and context if its authentic. My experience was overall favorable. No problems with my reservations or with check-in. You get a nice hospitality pack with your check-in materials and the staff was friendly and efficient. My room (a non-smoking queen) was tidy and did not smell of cigarettes. The TV had fewer cable channels than some other hotels with similar price range but they have a library of DVDs in the lobby you can watch for free on the DVD player in your room. My room had a small refrigerator and microwave. Also a coffee maker with coffee packets, hair dryer, iron, and ironing board. I noticed that each day one towel, the first tissue paper, and toilet paper ends were folded in some kind of origami decoration \u2013 a nice touch especially considering it must have taken somebody some extra time to fold and plait the stuff. My bed was kinda soft but not a problem. Both nights the locale had no other noises than the occasional train in the distance and a little bit of freeway rumble. The breakfast area was clean and bright. The complimentary breakfast includes waffles you make yourself, a variety of pastries, bagels, toast, boiled eggs, oatmeal, cereal, fruit, coffee and tea. Not exactly hearty fare but, you know, it\u2019s healthier that way. I noted that on the morning I checked out that the bagels were hard enough to knock out fillings (i.e. stale) \u2013 just a warning. Observing my fellow travelers at breakfast, I would guess they were mostly families on trips of some kind rather than business travel but you never know. This is my kind of place meaning functional and value \u2013 not the place anybody would run away to in order to \u201cpop the question,\u201d spice their marriage, or maybe ruin their marriage. I\u2019m not exactly certain I would stay here again except if I were attending another work event at the Convention Center and needed to save money and I wouldn\u2019t want to stay here without a vehicle.

The location is a little different, but compared to the prices of the hotels that are actually in the Old Town state park, their prices were a pretty significant savings. The road the hotel is on is kind of busy during the day, but the rooms don't face toward the street, and the landscaping and pool are so pleasant that you don't really notice the street after you've been there a little while, and the traffic really dies down at night, and you don't really hear the traffic if you're in your room, and I had no problem sleeping at all. The staff is very accomodating, and the place has quite a few nice little touches that you don't see at other hotels in their price range. The way they do their towels is pretty cool, and they even have a nifty little way of folding the end of the toilet paper roll... (you have to see it for yourself). Anyway, I enjoyed my stay, and will definitely stay there again.", "Date": "August 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Campbell, California", "Title": "\u201cDecent motel, lousy location.\u201d", "Author": "HunterBarney", "ReviewID": "UR76186153", "Content": "I must say I was disappointed in the property after reading the rave reviews here.

I simply could not pass this place up after reading all the reviews. First trip with family to San Diego and wanted to find a gem that met our needs (close to the beach, close to town, safe and clean). The Old Town Inn was where I landed. The motel is really out of place in an industrial area a good 5-7 minute walk to Old Town and sandwiched between the rail line stop and large warehouses. The price was (with tax $150 per night for the larger two queen room. Parking is free (a definite saving compared to most motels in area). Bedding, rugs, linens and overall cleanliness was adequate. The pool was tucked away and provided a good dip between activities. Towles and plenty of chairs at least late afternoons when I used the facilities. Breakfast included in the price was comparable to Hampton Inn, Comfort Inn, etc. Enough fuel to start the day. Nothing fancy, but good. So compared to the prices I sought in Sand Diego, this was a good bargain. Now some istems to consider when thinking of booking: 1) We stayed on the weekend and the surrounding location was very empty. So anyone walking around at night appeared a bit out of place. The area is not seedy, but suspect and my work takes me daily to NYC so I have a good barometer. 2) Daytime use of the transit system is fine. Once dark, weirdos, homless, strange folks, like any other city, come out to play. Did not feel comfortable after 9:00 PM going home including the walk back to the hotel. 3) Old Town is a neat place to spend time, good food, authentic and charming. Felt comfortable there and the food was excellent. 4) The rides to the beaches (Pacific and Mission and Coronado) were all easy. THis is a great place to stop if going to Sea World, it is close by. OVERALL It is what is described but nothing more than an average place in a weird area with some nice touches.

I would like to add several of my own however. First, in reading the reviews I noticed several that were negative. Those reviews were quite old and all of the problems mentioned seem to have been addressed. Second, what makes the Old Town Inn so special is all of the \"little things\".......coffee and tea available in the lobby all the time......an extra-large sink area in the bathroom.....computer availability.....and so much more. Third, at the time of booking I asked for a \"quiet room\" and we were given a room on the 3rd floor. No car doors slamming. No noise from above. And last, the \"tunnel\" to get to Old Town that was mentioned in quite a few of the reviews was a bit off-putting to me until I saw it. It is large, bright, artistically decorated, and under 24/7 security monitoring. I worried for nothing!

This hotel isn\u2019t much to look at \u2013 it is situated in what appears to be an industrial area that, at first glance, seems to be in the middle of nowhere. However, the location turned out to be a good one in that it is just 10 minutes walk to major shops and restaurants, 5 minutes walk to Old Town Historic Park(including the hop-on hop-off orange trolley car terminal), a 3 minute walk to San Diego\u2019s major public transport hub from where buses and trains depart regularly (meaning easy access to the Zoo, Seaworld, downtown, etc). The room was quite spacious and clean, and the beds were comfortable enough. Car parking is free. Staff were very friendly and always keen to assist. Maps were available, as was a 1 pager providing tips on public transport, locations of nearby grocery stores/pharmacies/etc, and other useful information. But it was the little extras that made this hotel one that I would gladly stay at again. The continental breakfast lacked nothing \u2013 we couldn\u2019t have asked for more in terms of variety and quality. The hotel provided free DVDs and board games for guests (a great bonus when you\u2019ve got young children). There was free computer and internet access in the lobby area, which also provided free coffee throughout the evening, as well as a sofa (with fire-place), newspapers and books to read. On request, a full box of kitchen utensils and equipment was delivered to our room, meaning that we could cook dinner rather than having to dine out every night Negatives: The family rooms are located in the rear corners of the main building, and lacked any natural light, even in the middle of the day. Furniture was a little outdated, and at times the room had a bit of a musty smell to it. Summary: The Old Town Inn is not a luxury hotel \u2013 in fact its rooms are quite basic.

We booked the first night at Old Town Inn and 2 nights in the other hotel. After spending one night in each hotel, we checked out of the second hotel (even though we had to pay for the second night there) just so we could check back in to the Old Town Inn. Everything good about this hotel has already been said, and I agree. You can definitely tell the owners and employees care for this hotel - from the clean rooms to the awesome customer service. Every time I saw one fo the OTI employees, they greeted us with a smile and some sort of kind greeting. For me, it was the little things that put this hotel WAY over the top. Each room had a small fridge AND a microwave. Although we didn't use either (because we aren't used to having them in our rooms in the chain hotels), it is now something we can keep in mind on our next trip. The breakfast is basic, but they provide the make-your-own-waffle stand, which is just a great touch. The bedding and linens show their wear, but are clean and neat. The first room we stayed in had 2 queen beds which happened to be much more comfortable than the king we got on our return - but both were miles more comfortable than the other hotel we stayed in. I have nothing but more praise for this hotel, but it will be continuing to repeat all the other good things everyone else has already said.

We stayed here last year (March 2009) and booked to stay again this year (March 2010) and the quality and service has not changed. If anything, the hotel has improved. We had an unusual traveling situation (we were flying standby from overseas) and so were not able to pinpoint a definite time for arrival/departure. Not only did Beatriz and other hotel staff members help us with rental car and taxi information, they also held our room and did not blink an eye to many last minute changes we had to make due to our standby status at the airport changing frequently. We never got an endless ring or a busy tone, a re-routing of our call to a main office somewhere out of state while making/changing reservations, and we were never put into \"hold heaven\" each phone call we made. Our calls were answered within a few rings, the staff (especially Beatriz) was courteous and understanding with our changes, and professional. They EVEN called us back to let us know our room was ready EARLY, along with suggestions of a quieter room they had off the highway side!! Wow. It is a bit older facility, but certainly not in its pride in ownership and management. The grounds are impeccable, the pool surrounded with pretty bushes and flowers, and the rooms clean, comfortable and spacious. Though not in \"hot spot\" locations other popular, familiar-named hotels tout, Old Town Inn is MORE conveniently located, in our opinion. It is an oasis in an otherwise not so \"bling bling,\" stuffy city location. When freeways and highways in downtown, airport, and Gaslamp Quarter areas get congested with traffic (often) you will wish you never parked a car (and paid a daily fee for doing so!) at a hotel other than one positioned like where the Old Town Inn is. Its Pacific Highway location is this hotel's best kept secret, especially when pressed for time to get to and from the airport and car rental pick up/drop off locations in a hurry. It also is a short walk from the lobby of the hotel to the bus/shuttle/trolley station in Old Town. The rates are remarkably affordable for such a great location. Though along the road, past the bus station, and then down under a highway tunnel, we felt safe (even at night) in walking, as a family, from our room to Old Town (great restaurants, stores, and nice town to enjoy and walk through!)

What a wonderful restaurant, small, and cozy, fantastic food and service. The next day, we walked to the transit area and took the bus to Sea World, the next time we went ~ the following Oct.

The pool is not huge, but certainly does the trick, we enjoyed the foliage around the pool and watching the hummingbirds.

I booked several months early but none-the less we were shown a room on 1st floor under a pillar and the room was very dark. We didn't come to San Diego for 5 days to stay in the dark. We were given another room but instead of the 2 queen beds we had one queen and a pull out couch. I took the pull out couch as you know how comfortable those are and my husband has back problems. The pluses- yes, a very good value for San Diego and the rooms were very clean and nice. The lobby and breakfast area are clean and nice and staff is friendly and helpful. The pool area is nicely landscaped but it is a small pool and no hot tub. There is a barbecue by the pool and my husband cooked on it and said it needs to be replaced. The location is a plus and a minus. It is a plus as only a couple miles from airport, a walk to old town, short drive to downtown and embarcadero, and short drive to Balboa Park and Sea World. The minuses- the location is a bit industrial. I picked this place because of good trip advisor reviews and I do think it is o.k. for adults but not especially for kids. There was a \"hobo\" as my son calls homeless - sitting one morning outside our room. I did tell the office and they did something about it but it was a little unsettling as he was talking to himself. We also decided by the same token we didn't want to walk to Old Town at night. The TV stations are slim and only kid programs were Cartoon Network which most moms know is trashy cartoons and nothing kids can watch after 8 p.m. There was HBO family which had PG13 movies - nothing my son could watch. He got hooked on TLC however, as it had the only programs that were PG rated. I know - we were in San Diego not to watch TV - but tell me that after you walk all over the SD zoo, SeaWorld and Wild Animal Park - you want to veg at night.

I asked at the front desk which way to go in order to see a few things and instead of sending me into the old town right near by they sent me on the industrial road (on which I only saw storage facilities and homeless people) and up over an on ramp for cars basically. While the park I would have eventually gotten to would have been nice I'm sure, it was not worth the journey. As a side note, there is a fenced off bike path that runs along the highway that's still not great but safer than the on ramp.

We stayed here for the ACN National Convention from February 27 to March 2nd. Every staff working at the Inn was friendly. When I was calling in to check for availability three separate times, each staff member I had talked with was very polite and respectful. We arrived in San Diego early and the staff were able to keep our luggage in the Manager's office until we came back for a proper check-in. The room was basic but very clean. The two queen beds were very comfortable and the shower was great! Every day coming back from the Convention we would find our beds beautifully re-made. The concierge is open 24 hours. One night, two of my colleagues were thirsty and wanted some milk to drink at midnight... The staff in charge allowed us to get some milk from the kitchen. Breakfast was plentiful with bagels, waffle ovens, 3 or 4 types of cereal, orange juice, milk, muffins and danish buns. Commuting to the Convention Center was made relatively easy by the Trolley Line. Warning: It can get confusing at the Old Town stop! If you want to go to the Convention Center, take the Blue line (although it comes to you at the wrong direction... It's just that it's the end of the blue line, and so the trolley actually goes in reverse.), stop at America Plaza, walk across the trolley line and then Take the Orange line to Convention Center. You'll get the hang of it :)! Total commute time from Old Town to Convention (approx 15-20 minutes). I'd recommend everyone to try the Casa Guadalajara Restaurant situated in Old Town, and the Thai Ly restaurant in the heart of Gaslamp Quarters.

We chose Old Town Inn based on TripAdvisor reviews, and we were pleased. We wanted to be close to downtown and the cruise terminal, but didn't want to pay $200 to $300 a night downtown for each couple, so we came here. Great choice. We got the family room that has a bedroom with a full kitchen and 2 queens (very good friends can share this bedroom easily.) Can't beat the price - it was less than half of the cost of staying downtown, and we were less than a 5 minute walk from the train station and trolley line. We enjoyed using the trolley for all our travels. A quick walk to Old Town, too, which we did a couple times. Ultra clean. Very friendly, accommodating staff. We called and said we were arriving early, and they made our room ready at noon. Pool was sparkling, although it was still a little chilly to use. My only complaint about location was the long walk to the closest grocery store. We actually used our kitchen, and cooked breakfasts in our room. Our husbands complained about the long walk to and from the store through a not so desirable section of town. It would be nice if the hotel provided a shopping service once a day, or something like that - or maybe just a drive to and from the store once or twice a day. That would really help. Room was quiet, well maintained. We'd stay there again, and our friends were thrilled with the choice. Cab ride from the airport was $16-18, and to the cruise terminal the same. Multi-day trolley passes were cheap - I think $3 a day or something like that and we used the dickens out of our passes, good on the trolley and buses, too. From the hotel, just a 15 minute ride to downtown and the gaslamp district.

Everything about the room was fine with the exception of a squeaky floor (which gave us something to laugh about) I think overall that people our age (mid twenties) might be better suited at a hotel downtown as more of our activities were focused closer to the city and not as much on other areas of San Diego (mission valley, la jolla) which the old town inn IS very central too ( it seemed as though we were the youngest guests too).

I have previously called the hotel directly to book a room for two adults, and was given a price quote and a reservation number. Due to some miscommunication, I was booked for a room for Jun 23 and 24 instead of Jul. I was quoted around 150 bucks for 2 nights over the phone, and did not receive any other confirmation after that. When I arrived at the hotel on Jul 23, the person at the counter told me that I booked for Jun, and since I have missed my booking they had charged me 170 bucks for not showing up. Apparently, that was the price for \"one night\". They didn't have any vacancy either, and would not let me use the hotel phone to see if there are any other vacancies in the area. Instead they directed me to the pay phone outside the hotel, which ate up our 75 cents, the last of our change. I was really frustrated, since I have planned the trip that does not account for any delays such as this. We had no more change to call hotels, I was out 170 bucks, and I had no place to stay. Finally they told us that they had one room that they can let us stay in. It was 170 bucks a night, since the Comic-Con was in town. So from an average of 90/night to 170/night. Desperate for a place to stay, we took their offer. But let's just say that we were not happy campers. But to be fair, aside from that, the stay was more than pleasant. The room was nice and clean, the bed was so big that it felt impractical (you could fit 3 adults on it) and it was comfy. The breakfast was ok, with bagels, waffles, toast, stuff like that. Someone helps you make the waffles too if you don't want to do it yourself. When we checked out, I talked to the GM, Beatriz, about my 170 penalty for \"not showing up when I was supposed to\". I had booked for Jul, not Jun, but I got charged 170 bucks! I was quoted 150 then, even if they were going to charge me, why did I get charged for more? Beatriz immediately fixed that for me by putting the money back on my credit card and apologized for the mistake. And with that, I left the hotel quite satisfied with the overall service and quality of the hotel. Although I think the younger staff they hired (like the teenage front desk girl that first helped me when I checked in on Jul 23) needs some improvement, overall it was a pleasant stay. I'd recommend it.

I work at a travel wholesaler so I know the ropes. I hopped online and stumbled upon the Old Town Inn (after several hopefuls but no success). I read the reviews on Trip Advisor, at first I was leery, but I must say the reviews that are \u2018good\u2019 couldn\u2019t be truer. I was kind of skeptical about pre-booking and not seeing the property, but after my stay I am glad I relied on others feedback. The property is huge; there is a new section and an old section. Originally, we were going to stay in the new section, but (for the sake of budget) decided we\u2019d take the old section and if it was too gnarly we\u2019d upgrade to the new section. (side note \u2013 by staying in the old section we saved $75.00) So we arrived around 11:30am to be greeted by the desk clerk (who was ultra friendly), and he told us check in is normally 3, but our room was ready so he let us check in early at no extra charge. So we head towards our room with fingers crossed and hope for the best, and surprise! It\u2019s the cutest room ever, and more importantly clean! Sleep was good, there was no noise, the bathroom was clean, plenty of towels, breakfast was included \u2013 we couldn\u2019t ask for more.

Thankfully we went to Legoland before we checked in at the Oldtown inn. Once we arrived the gentlemen who checked us in was very nice and helpful in directing us to a place to eat. My daughters were settled in and my husband asleep and I was folding clothes to put away since we were going to be staying for another couple of days.

He pulled the sheets back and there crawling on the pillow was a bedbug. I ran and woke my daughters put them in the bathroom immediately and went straight downstairs to notify an employee, this was at 1:00 in the morning.

Although, it seemed to be clean in the lobby, and the room appeared to be clean...you just never know. Anyone thinking of staying here or any other hotel, check your mattresses, sheets, pillows.

The staff is very nice and helpful; upon checking in, they offered us advice on restaurants and other attractions. The continental breakfast was quite good and the waffle makers that others have mentioned were fun to use. As a non-coffee drinker, I really appreciate that they had hot chocolate packets available (though, I would have loved some herbal tea bags as well!). The breakfast includes cereal, muffins, bagels, toast, orange juice, milk and more. The rooms are quite spacious and very clean. The countertops near the bathroom are made of granite and have plenty of room for your toiletries. Our first night, we ordered pizza from Broadway Pizza, thanks to the recommendations included on a laminated sheet in the room. The pizza was really delicious, a good price and delivered right to our door (no address needed; I just needed to tell them \"Old Town Inn\" and they said, \"OK!). The next night, we drove the few blocks to Old Town. I did some research on Google and found lots of good reviews for the Cafe Coyote and Cantina, located at 2461 San Diego Avenue. We were told the wait would be 20 minutes, but by the time I parked the car and walked a few blocks to the restaurant, my wife already had a table. The service was great, the chips & salsa wer e quite tasty, the hand-made tortillas were great, the portions were generous and the fried ice-cream was delicios. The area gets a bit crowded during the evening, but free parking is available on the street or at the Old Town recreation area on Congress Street between Mason St. & Twiggs St. Just be prepared to pounce as soon as you find a spot during the busy evening hours). I would highly recommend the Old Town Inn for those wishing to see Sea World, the San Diego Zoo and Old Town. The staff is top notch, even if you can't make reservations via their Web site (when I called for a reservation, Beatriz was nice enough to call me back rather put me on hold while she checked in other guests.

A few oddities: The carpet felt damp the entire time we were there, like they were just shampooed but didn't dry completely. The ventilation of the bathroom wasn't great, drops of water condensed on the ceiling and dropped on our heads (and some of the water was brown). A few lightbulbs were out or close to dead so they would flicker endlessly. I think the previous resident in our room had set the alarm to ring at 7:30 am and didn't turn it off. So, of course, the alarm blared like a siren only after we'd just gotten in 5 hours earlier...SIGH, that was a bad start to an otherwise great trip.

Well... It's not that little considering that it has 3 buildings to its name, but it still gives you a cosy and warm feeling. Given that we arrived on Amtrak @ Old Town Station, or rather, the Old Town Platform, the hotel was a short less-than-a-mile walk across the Transit Centre Car Park. Check-in was efficient, and while they did not have the King-Bed Non-Smoking Efficiency Room we had reserved, they upgraded us to a Queen-Bed Smoking one with a full kitchenett. While we really do hate the idea of staying in a smoking room, the hotel really did their very best to deordorize the room and their efforts are not missed. Sadly though, once the heater / air-conditioning is turned on, the smell of smoke came back on full blast. There are no views to speak off at The Old Town Inn, but its proximity to the Old Town transit Centre literally means that you could get to any place in San Diego rather easily. A short 5-minute walk would bring us to the Trolley Station, and from there its a 15-minute ride to Downtown San Diego. Similarly, we could catch a Metro Bus to SeaWorld, which would take all of 20-minutes. The Zoo could also be reached in about 35 minutes. What we loved best is that the hotel has prepared sheets of instructions (driving, public transport, walking, etc) to all the main places of interests from the hotel, so it makes it so much easier for us to simply follow the insturctions and get to where we want to go! The hotel also provides breakfast in a small breakfast room besides the lobby and while simple, was more than adequate to get one going in the mornings. What we loved best was the waffle maker, which if you do know how to operate, would churn out perfect crispy waffles in a matter of minutes! For the reasonable price we paid, we would certainly return to The Old Town Inn should we visit San Diego again as compared to other hotels located Downtown, which could easily cost 2 to 3 times more.", "Date": "January 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Utah", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "ikeymakes3", "ReviewID": "UR11991615", "Content": "Our stay for 1 night was wonderful.

We found the location suitable for our four-night stay, as we were doing the tourist thing in San Diego using public transport. The transit centre is a little over five minutes walk away (walk through the carpark, out the car entry/exit point, cross the highway at the pedestrian crossing with lights and walk a minute or so down the highway). We caught a number of buses during our visit and I must say every single bus driver was extremely friendly and helpful - it certainly left me with a very good impression of the people of San Diego! The location is in a bit of an industrial-type area, but another five minutes walk past the transit centre is Old Town with all its restaurants. I imagine though that most people would probably feel more comfortable walking at night if they weren't walking alone. The Old Town Inn is the kind of place where the door rooms open to a common walkway that fronts the carpark. However this wasn't an issue for us. The room itself was quite large even with the two queen beds and the air-conditioning unit worked well.

We had prebooked the Inn by contacting them through their website after reading a number of positive reviews here on Tripadvisor. The hotel was completely full due to the Veteran's Day weekend. We had a very early disembarkation from the Celebrity Mercury. We rented a car from Thrifty and spent a couple hours seeing the sights - visiting the lovely Del Coronado Hotel on Coronado Island and exploring the Gaslamp District of downtown San Diego. We then drove to the Old Town Inn to check in, but they had had a full house the night before and said to come back in a few hours. We left our car in a parking spot near our room and walked to the historic area of Old Town. Because it was the Veteran's Day holiday we were pleasantly surprised to discover that there were free tours of Old Town Historic park being offered hourly! We were escorted on our tour by four costumed guides portraying known real-life characters from San Diego's early history. One of the park personnel portrayed a gossip-loving female, the wife of an early California governor, who has been immortalized by the letters she left behind showing her proclivity to gossip about fellow citizens and a well documented rivalry with another leading female of Old Town! That day there was also a fellow dressed as an early sherrif, an Irishman who was depicting an early settler and another 19th century young male character. They were all very entertaining and informative, as prior to our day in Old Town we had scant knowlege of California's early history. They each stayed in character for the entire tour and introduced themselves only at the end. Two were park employees and two volunteer reenactors. Old Town is the California equivalent of St. Augustine, a place we live very close to and are well acquainted with in Florida. If you get a chance to see one of these reenactments in Old Town, do so! After our delightful two hour \"tour\" we browsed through a number of the other historic buildings, did some shopping and then had lunch at the Old Town Mexican Cafe (I am writing a seperate review of this restaurant of which we were not particularly impressed). We then walked back to the Old Town Inn to check into our room and catch a couple hours rest, although we did walk back to Old Town in the early evening to do more browsing. We were very happy with our second floor non-smoking standard room with a queen-sized bed and clean and spacious bath. There was absolutely no noise and we felt that at $69 for the night we got a very good deal. They had coffee available at all times in the office area, as well as a coffee pot and all you needed to make it in the room. They also had free internet usage in the office- I'm not sure about in the rooms as we did not have our laptop on this trip. They also have a lovely clean pool area, free goody bags that included toothpaste, razors, gum and a few other items given to us at the very friendly professional check-in, and an absolutely delightfully clean and well-decorated breakfast area open from 6-10 am that even lets you make your own piping hot waffles! The pastries, cereals, joice and coffee were all very good, as well, and we were completely satisfied with our short stay at the Old Town Inn. I highly recommend this hotel for all travelers.

My last complaint is that during breakfast there was not enough help in clearing tables and making sure supplies were handy. It looked like just one person was responsible for everything. One morning every table was either occupied or dirty with no one cleaning the tables for new arrivals. Again, I had to clean my own table so that we could use it.

The main reason for choosing this hotel was its location near old town. I had a bit of difficulty finding the hotel in the first place but when I did I was surprised to find it in a somewhat industrial area and the nearby neighbourhood didn't look the best in the world. In fact whoever decided to call the hotel the Old town inn deserves royalties because I'm sure the name gets people interested in the hotel as an old town accommodation spot. On a map the hotel looks very near old town which technically it is. But to get there, even if it only takes 5 minutes, you have to walk past a warehouse, cross a busy highway, walk under a freeway and then an underpass under some railway tracks and a trolley station (the trolley goes all the way to Mexico border from here). Not really a walk for those with a nervous disposition although once in old town everything seemed safe enough. In a nutshell I'd prefer a few more touristy things adjacent to the hotel to make the walk more pleasant. Being on the highway has one advantage. Its an easy 5 minute drive to SeaWorld if that's what you're in San Diego for. As someone who has visited most other parks in Southern California I thought that park was a little too commercialised for my liking with not enough rides or indeed shade to keep the little ones happy.

However, on my key-car envelope, it was clearly marked that we were supposed to be on the 3rd floor in room 313. We went back to the desk where the very friendly receptionist explained that the hotel was booked and that our ground floor room was the only one left. So, despite my numerous emails in advance and the key card written out in my name with a 3rd floor room assignment, we were stuck with leftovers. I have heavy-duty ear plugs, so I thought it would be ok. At 6:15 am this morning, the herd of elephants in the room above us woke us up, apparently preparing for the circus. Despite my heavy-duty ear plugs, I could also hear cars in the parking lot. After unsuccessfully trying to go back to sleep (ah, jetlag!) I decided to take a swim in the heated pool for some exercise and relaxation. I got to the pool at 6:45 am. Locked. I went inside t o reception to see if someone could open it, and the receptionist (different from our arrival) refused. I explained that I had been woken up, was jetlagged, and just wanted to swim some laps and not make any noise, but je refused, saying no, the pool doesn't open until 7 am. However, there were about 4 people eating breakfast in the breakfast room, whereas allegedly breakfast doesn't start until 7 am either... So now I am back in the \"deluxe\" room, which I purposely put in quotes because it's barely big enough to fit the 2 beds (which are, however, very comfortable). Luckily, the WiFi is working fine. While the reservations staff was friendly, as was the person who welcomed us last night, I do not feel that friendliness makes up for misleading me about getting a quiet room (everyone knows that a ground floor room is never the quietest!!!) and for this morning's unfriendliness and lack of know-how of when to make an exception (btw, the pool hours are *not* posted at the pool.)

Multiple signs posted that the inn uses chemicals that are dangerous for pregnant women/cause birth defects.

We could walk to Old Town for dinner, and the central location was great for driving to the zoo, Coranado, and a wedding we attended on Vacation Island.

They also sold us discounted tickets to the zoo (which was great, by the way.)

The little dining room was light and cheery, and the pool is nice too. While not super-fancy, the rooms were clean and tasteful. The linens were good, though not luxurious.

The rooms were pleasant however they were lacking many items. There was no fridge, safe and the rollaway bed they brought us was probably thirty years old. The staff was pleasant when we booked in, gave us great maps for getting around and arranged for us to have extra pillows and blankets. Our room was near the road and we heard everything. Unless we had the air conditioning on high we had a hard time sleeping. I slept well in Anaheim but after the second night at the Old Town Inn both my husband and I had sore backs. I was tired after sleeping at the Inn. The rooms were clean and nicely appointed, however our rollaway bed was never made the three nights we spent there. The breakfast was just okay, the first morning we had to go find staff to restock as there was nothing left and it was still quite early with a lot of people standing around waiting for food. The breakfast room is small and they ask you not to eat outside of the breakfast room. I'm not sure where you should eat if you can't get a table. ( standing up, I guess). The pool is fine and clean. There is no hot tub. Parking became difficult if you were one of the last in the parking lot. It is small and difficult to manage. We would have rated our stay okay until we went to check out. We had checked in using our CAA Visa Travellers Cheque Card. They accepted this and yet when we went to check out they told us they could not accept this ( even though we had no problems with our other hotel, restaurants and shops for the last 10 days). We had to go and get cash from the bank. When we returned home, we notice on the statement, they had put the money through on our Visa when we checked in and then taken our cash at check out. This has been resolved but only after calling them . Apparently the girl who checked us in should not have accepted our card. We spoke with our CAA and Visa and they said they have never had anyone reject this card. It is the same as a travellers cheque but in the form of a card which makes it much easier to use. Old Town Inn is the only hotel which we know of that does not accept it. I think perhaps the Inn should get up to date on new payment methods. Would I return? No. And obviously I would not recommend this to anyone else. The inn was okay but the check out definetly turned me off.

It had to be close to a trolley station so that we could get by without a car. It also needed to be clean, quiet and affordable. After weeks of searching and reading reviews of hotels, I was beginning to feel that I would never find the perfect hotel. Then I stumbled on the reviews for Old Town Inn. It sounded just perfect for what we wanted. I called the hotel and the person on the phone was extremely polite and helpful. So we booked in for a week. When we showed up, I wondered if it would be as good as it had sounded. And it was. The Trip Advisor reviews had been right on. It was a real find!! We had a delux room with a kitchenette. The room was very spacious with a sofa and coffee table. We would have preferred to have a table and chairs rather than a desk with an extra chair drawn up to it, but that was a small thing. If you book a kitchenette, it does not come with the dishes, etc in the room. You have to ask at the front desk and they will deliver a large case full of dishes, utensils, dishclothes, detergent, etc. But if we were to do it over, we would have not spent the extra few dollars for the kitchen unit. Each unit has a microwave and fridge, so we really didn't need the gas burners. We could have saved the extra 5 dollars a day and just bought some paper plates. The bed was really comfortable and the room was very quiet. One of the best things about the hotel is the location. It is a 5 minute walk to the bus and trolley station. From there we were able to get to anywhere we wanted cheaply and easily. A day pass was only 15 dollars for 4 days so you can't beat the price!! The Old Town area is right next to the trolley station, so we were able to wander around there whenever we wanted. There was an Italian restaurant by the trolley station that had a 5 dollar pizza special each day. So we were able to take it home and have a delicious dinner for next to nothing. The breakfast at the Old Town Inn was truly amazing. Yes, technically it was a deluxe continuental breakfast. But it had make yourself hot waffles and hard boiled eggs, so there was a lot of variety. They also had tea, coffee, hot chocolate, juice, yogurt,fresh fruit, fruit salad, assorted cold cereals, instant oatmeal, about 5 types of bagels, 4 types of danishes, toast, etc. We were there for a week and I doubt we repeated the same breakfast choices. The meal filled us up enough that we rarely needed lunch. It is also a really nice breakfast room, so we often stayed and chatted with our friends for an hour. It was definitely the nicest continental buffet I have had at a hotel. The hotel wasn't cheap, but was on a par with what all the other chain hotels were charging. But our friends wanted to save a few bucks so they had booked one of the hotel's economy rooms. These rooms are fairly small, but they are able to fit in a table and 2 chairs. They also had a fridge and microwave. Their bathroom was small, but did not have a hairdryer. But since they were not planning to spend too much time in their room aside from sleeping, they felt it was fine for their needs. Their bed was also super comfortable. They paid about 20 dollars a night less. If I was staying for just one night or if I wanted to save a bit of money, I would not hesitate to stay in the economy room. They are currently renovating rooms in that wing, so there was a bit of extra construction noise earlier in the day for them. But if you don't mind the extra cost, go for the bigger deluxe room. I think it was worth it. There were several restaurants within a ten minute walk fo the hotel, so we really didn't miss having a car. On days when we were out all day at Sea World, etc, we often stopped on our way back for dinner and then just hopped on the next trolley or bus. That is the benefit of the day pass!! We are already planning another trip to San Diego, and we will definitely staying at the Old Town Inn. It is a real gem of a hotel. The staff is top notch. Nothing was too much trouble and their attitude was great. I also loved being able to use the lobby computer to check my emails. The hotel has a very spacious and comfortable lobby with a fireplace. The Old Town Inn is an oasis in the middle of an industrial area. We never felt unsafe. Even though it is near to a highway, the hotel is very quiet.

I only paid about 65 bucks for the night in a room with 2 double beds within a row of a motel like structure, which is likely the older of the structures on the property. I was tired and did not notice the traffic from the nearby street and close elevated I-5. No noise from neighbors and a clean room made this a bargain. It was indeed convenient. A car is still a good idea in SD. However, nearby are bus and trolley routes. On arrival about 4 PM, I noticed a very strong \"room freshener\" which was definitely overdone. My advice to the hotel is to insure that non-smoking rooms are absoulutely maintained non-smoking and that room fresheners be far more subtle and sparingly used. The bathroom was 1950s design with a small shower stall, toilet and small updated vanity. The two double beds would be adequate up to a 6 foot tall person but not beyond. If you are tall get aroom with a queen bed. The decor had a cheerful bedspread and paint scheme. TV was very basic cable. The lobby was warm and welcoming as was the staff. There is only one person at the desk. If more than one person is ready to check in or out there will be a wait, so don't wait until the last minute to leave. The breaksfast was adequate and convenient self serve. Bagels, dry cereal, instant oatmeal, pastries and make your own waffles. The waffle batter was bland to paper mache' in flavor and texture - might be improved with a longer cook time and perhaps a different batter. One piece of advice to the staff - get a sneeze guard and keep the food out of children's reach. We observed one hacking, sneezing child spreading her germs over the pastries and bagels. We stuck with the non-descript waffles. Eating breakfast out may be worth it. All in all, if you just need a convenient place to flop, this place works out well.

The bad news... In general, there was a bunch of little things that were kind of annoying for us, We are two men in our 40s that rented 2 rooms (a small one and a larger one (the larger one had a kitchen and sofabed as well as a queen)-- both non-smoking) 1. The first \"larger room\" they gave me had a strong cigarette smoke smell. The carpet actually had cigarette burns in it in spite of the fact that this was supposed to be a non-smoking room. 2. I was transferred to another room (no smoke smell) but it (and my friend's room) both had a perfumy/disinfectant kind of smell that we both found unpleasant. (Perhaps, it's that Fabreze stuff and you might not mind it but both of us left the windows open to get rid of it).. The second room also had cigarette burns in it (these were on the blanket). In addition, the back of the door to the room had some heavy scratches and dents on it as if something heavy had been thrown against it. 3. When I returned later to my room, and turned on the tap to brush my teeth, there was an overpoweringly strong sulphur smell (rotten eggs smell) coming out of the tap. 4. I went to buy bottled water and the vending machine I tried was out of water; the second one stole my money and failed to dispense my water. 5. When we arrived, The pool had a sign on it saying that the water heater was broken although I saw people swimming in it later in the day who said it was warm. 6. The \"make your own\" waffles for breakfast were pretty tastelss and the cereal had a stale taste. The cereal was dispensed from large glass jars via scoops. I thought it strange that the scoops were stored by hanging them by the scoop-part (not by the handle) on the wooden knobs that were screwed into the center of the jar lids. In this way, every \"dirty\" hand that came in contact with a jar lid -- and left its germs on the lid's knob --resulted in those germs being transferred to the scoop which in turn was repeatedly inserted into the jar. (Yeech!). I believe that the reason the cereal tasted stale was that the jars were never emptied and washed -- just re-filled from time to time. 7. The remarks of the prior posters notwithstanding, there was some traffic noise from the street. My room was about 1/2 way back from the driveway entrance and you could still hear some noise in the distance (with the windows closed). It didn't disturb me -- I feel asleep easily but it might affect light sleepers, especially if your room was closer to the street. FYI, the smaller rooms (what they call \"the bungalows) are farther away from the street than the larger rooms. in general. Ok, the good news... 1. The lobby was very nice -- there was the fireplace and attractive furnishings. 2. Check-in was a snap. Mary at reception (who later changed my room) was a delight as was everyone who worked there. 3. The rooms were very nicely' decorated: even the smaller room was nice -- the only slight drawback was the smaller room's bath which had the \"original tile\" which while clean looked a little old.. 4. Everyone who worked there was very helpful and kind. When I lost my money in the soda machine, the deskclerk led me to the third machine (in the laundry room) and gave me the money I had lost. 5. The Orange Juice and tea at breakfast was tasty. I did not try the bagels but they were large and lots of people appeared to be enjoying them. I've sinced talked to a plumber who told me that the \"sulpur smell\" that I experienced (which was not in the shower, btw) could have resulted from a recent plumbing repair and probably would go away in a week or less.

Now, first off, I was hesitant of the place after seeing a room other than the one we stayed in as well as the weird location of the Inn. But I have to say, this is a great find and I'm glad I followed the advise of other tripadvisors! The location is awes...it couldn't get any better. The location of this hotel is literally RIGHT next to the tranportation depot and within walking distance to Old Town. There are great little shops and restaurants in this area and instead of going downtown like we had planned, my fiance and I spent the whole weekend in Old Town. No need for a car or worrying about parking. The hotel was clean, the breakfast was great and the staff was VERY accomodating. I was even able to get the wireless internet from my room (#305). I have to give a shout out to Oke (not sure if that is spelled right) as we had a bit of an experience when we first arrived. Our flight was five hours late so instead of getting there at 9:30pm, we arrived at 2:30am. He was very pleasant and when we realized the room we had been booked with was not what we were looking for, he happily moved us to another location as well as comp'd us for our troubles and pretty much missing the first nights stay. By the time we got to the room and to bed it was 4am. The bed was sooo comfy though (pillowtop) so I was able to get a good nights sleep. Even though I was given a smoking room (that was all that was left to accomodate my needs), it really was not a bad room and didn't smell as bad as it could have. I will DEF stay here when I come back. You cannot ask for a better deal in pricey San Diego. Hopefully this hotel will stay true to it's colors and not let big business drive their prices up.

In any event, most reviews on TA are accurate. This is a motel facility on a busy 6 lane highway facing a munitions plant. That said, it was not noisy at all in our room which was not far from the street. We had a king-sized bed, a small desk, a sofa facing an armoire holding a television with basic cable channels. The room was well maintained and the bathroom and dressing area were very tidy. One gripe about most motels, the industrial carpet was not clean - so it's a good idea to bring slippers. The motel makes a great effort to create a pleasant atmosphere in an industrial area. Travel time to the airport is only 5 minutes but we heard no air traffic! The staff are all very friendly. The desk had ample help to facilitate check in for the large crowd as all rooms were sold out the entire weekend. As mentioned, there is a sunny breakfast room off the lobby featuring FREE cold cereals, muffins, bagels, and rolls. There were 2 toasters, a microwave and various spreads and jam. A bowl of fruit cup and 2 self-serve waffle grills seemed to fascinate many visitors.

I think the problem is that people are normalizing the review based on the cost, but I'm not going to do that. If you're willing to put up with the few issues, then it's an awesome bargain. I would have given it 3.5 stars, but since I can't, I've rounded up. Most of the reviews (good and bad) are pretty much right on. First, the good: 1) As mentioned, great bargain ... ~ $100/night for a double queen deluxe 2) Very good location - walking distance to Old Town and the Trolley station; minutes from Sea World, downtown, the airport, and the Zoo 3) Great breakfast (as everyone mentions) - it can easily save you a lot of money if you normally eat a big breakfast with a family <BR> 4) Very clean and nice decorum in the rooms, lobby, and poolside Now the bad: 1) This is by far the noisiest hotel/motel we've ever stayed in. And we've stayed in all different types of places, from old boutique hotels in busy downtown areas to the cheapest Motel 6 by a busy highway. And this noise is all internal, not from the nearby highway. During the busy time when most rooms are occupied, you can hear everything above you and on both sides. Every footstep sounds like an elephant stampede. Every bath or shower sounds like Niagra Falls. You can even hear conversations, drawers opening/closing, and faucets being turned. And this was in the new section. Luckily my 5 year old sleeps through everything and we are usually up by 6:30, or we would have been even more annoyed. When I mentioned this to the desk person as we were checking out, she said we should have stayed on the 3rd floor. Perhaps they can pre-warn people if 3rd floor rooms are still available. 2) The pool is basically useless, exept for probably July/August. It is small, and even though it is heated (supposedly) to 82deg, it is freezing. The entire week we were there, we saw a total of 2 kids using it. Perhaps we are too use to 90deg+ lake temps in Texas. ;) 3) Only one desk person at any time, even during the busy weekends, can make for a long wait.

So, I went with an open mind. The room we got was not located on the main grounds of the property, it was there older rooms, which I guess are the cheapest, they were located next door to the Inn. I first thought they were an apartment complex, but unfortunetely I was wrong. The room is very small with an even smaller shower stall. i mean I am 5'7, and had to bend over to get my head under the water. So if you envision taking a romantic shower with you significant other, than forget about it. We had a problem with one of the employees (Hanz) checking us in, he was just not the friendliest person in the world and the manager (Batrice) did say he was being trained for the day shift. We were given an upgrade to a room with a refrigerator and microwave which was great to keep some water. But, we found the freezer did not work when we bought some ice cream on night and the next moring we had a milk shake instead. So, if you get a fridge, I would not trust the freezer. The breakfast was very good, much more than you could ask for. Waffles were my favorite. Public Transportation was so close, this was my favorite part of the place, literally a 5 minute walk to the trolley, bus, and cab station. Which was great for us, since we took amtrak and used the trolley to go everywhere. All in all, The Old Town Inn was a decent place to stay, and I might stay here again for a cheap room.

There is significant street noise, it's located on a 4 lane road and you could hear a lot of noise between rooms.

For example, the towels were very thin, the bed was not very comfortable, there is only a shower stall not a tub, the lights in the room are turned on by pulling a string etc. None of these things are terrible so long as you are not expecting anything luxurious. The reception room was very sunny and tastefully decorated. In addition, the complimentary breakfast was a great surprise to us and more than adequate. They had a nice variety of dry cereals, muffins, bagels, fruit, and even waffle makers. The staff were usually cheery and pleasant. Although the woman who helped us at check-in was very slow and made no offer to hold our luggage or assist us in any way while we waited for our room be cleaned. We arrived at around 12:30 and check in wasn't until 3:00. We did not swim during out time here, but the pool area appears to be well kept although it's a bit small for the size of the hotel. The location is off a rather busy four lane road. It is near the Old Town area which is a fun way to spend an evening. There's great Mexican Food and many historic buildings.

The hotel was centrally located, near a major freeway, and in what appeared to be a quiet warehouse area. We visited the Old Town historic village (a 5-10 minute walk) and enjoyed some excellent Mexican food. The trolley and transit center, which we also utilized, is there as well. Although both sections of the hotel appear nearly the same, we later learned that there is a new section and an old one, and our \"economy\" room was in the old one. The room gave new definition to the word \"cozy\"; the better word would have been \"tiny\". The closet was ridiculous (barely large enough for one person's clothes, let alone two people), and you couldn't fully open the door because of the bed. The bathroom sink ledge was also too small for two traveler's toiletries. But the crowning insult was the infestation of ants behind and on the dresser. The room was sprayed twice and smelled awful. When we complained to the front office, instead of apologizing, they said we should have expected ants \"because San Diego sits on top of an ant hill\". (?)

I think the music stopped on its own around midnight. The next night we spotted a little cockroach scurrying across the dresser. My husband took care of it, but we were starting to regret our stay.

Trip Advisor has always been reliable for us, but definately not this time. To begin with, the hotel is not really in Old Town. It is located on an industrial road about a mile from the historic district. You can walk to the historic Old Town area, but you have to walk along Pacific Hwy for a bit, then cross under the freeway and past the train station to get to it. No way would I take my family along this route after dark. The room was old and had a musty smell. The furniture looked like it was from the 1970's. We were awoken both mornings at 5am by the garbage truck behind the hotel. To make matters worse, someone's dog starting barking out in the hallway at 7am and this went on for 30 minutes both mornings. The breakfast that everyone raves about is nothing more than a waffle maker, donuts, muffins, cereal, and yogurt. Of course the breakfast area is so small that it was always difficult to find somewhere to sit, especially if you have more than 2 people in your group. I took a quick peek at the pool which was very small like you would find at any budget motel. Parking is tight, we couldn't find a space when we first arrived late at night. Each space is very narrow, and pretty difficult to get in and out of the car when you can barely open the car door. The final straw was having to kill a cockroach in the bathroom in the middle of the night. I've never checked out of a hotel earlier than planned in my life, but we did that next morning. Yes, the front desk staff are friendly, and it's a convenient location for getting to Sea World and Old Town(by car), but it should be clarified that the Old Town Inn is simply a 1 star budget motel. You'll save some money staying here but it was not worth it. I can only conclude that all these glowing reviews are either fabricated by the owners of the motel, or the people submitting there opinions are comparing the place to a Motel 6 or Super 8. Giving it 5 stars is ridiculous. What would they give the Hotel del Coronado? We stayed our final night at the Courtyard San Diego Central for only $30 more a night. The place was great.

The room was large with plenty of room. It also was one of the cleanest rooms I have ever stayed in. It was spotless. The carpet was in excellent shape, like new, as was the furniture. The bed was very comfortable. The linens and bedspead were in excellent shape. It also had a small refrigerater and microwave. There was a large closet with plenty of space to put luggage. The outside of the hotel was well kept with plenty of free parking. I asked the staff for directions several times and they were always very helpful and knowledgeable. Susannah suggested several Mexican restaurants in Old Town that ended up having very excellent food. She also recommended that I try the trolley to go downtown to a ballgame. It was easy to use and dropped me off right next to Petco Field. The electric trolley train and also the city bus lines, both operate from the Transit Center, conveniently located about 200 yards away. Old Town, a must visit local attraction, is within walking distance right next to the Transit Center. You could just park your car at the hotel and access most places in the San Diego area from here. The trolley will take you to all the way to Mexico. It is also quicker if you consider the time to find a parking place downtown and also cheaper considering the price of parking downtown. I ate breakfast both mornings at their free breakfast bar. It was well stocked with a variety of cereals, breads, fruits, rolls, muffins, bagels, and several different juices, milk, and coffee. I was told they will soon add waffles. Espiranda was stocking the bar and worked as hard as any waitress I have ever seen. She never let anything get depleted. Be sure to tip her if you agree with my assessment. Because of her efforts, your breakfast will be an enjoyable way to start your day. They had a very nice pool area, although I did not have time to use it. After my two night stay here I moved to the Humphrey By the Bay because I wanted a bay view. Old Town Inn outdid the Humphrey in all ways except two, the bay view at Humphreys and the on site restaurant for dinner. In every other way it was better, cleaner, bigger room, and friendlier. That is not a knock on Humphrey's, which is higher ranked, just a complement to Old Town Inn. Old Town Inn was much lower priced. I actually wished I had stayed at Old Town Inn for all four nights.

If you are used to the Hyatt or similar you may not like this hotel, however you will save at least half on the room, not have to tip everyone who says hello, and save the $15-20 for parking. The rooms will be just as comfortable and the customer ranking of the hotel is probably higher than most of the Hyatts, Hiltons, and Sheratons in town. Compare for yourself. I highly recommend this hotel. I definately will stay here again.", "Date": "May 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colchester, England", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value for money & location for 'no car people'\u201d", "Author": "AliWorks2holiday", "ReviewID": "UR3420115", "Content": "Just returned to England following stay.

One in our group went to the conference center and it is about 15-25min ride depending on how fast the second trolley arrives at the station (You have to switch from the blue line to the orange line to get to the conference center and anywhere downtown...about 7 total stops) The Old Town Inn has a great continental breakfast and we had no problems as other people mentioned about needing to get up early to get the best out of the breakfast. Even at 8:45 there was plenty of food for us. The hotel was almost completely booked when we made these reservations and I am not sure that our room has always been a non-smoking room but it was very very clean and hard to tell so we didn't ask. We felt safe and comfortable in this location - especially being a group of only females. It is a pretty place and Old Town is really close as are some great Mexican restaurants (and Italian). Other areas are just a trolley stop away. I would recommend this place to others. We paid $85/night but it would have been cheaper had we been able to book sooner and gotten a smaller room.

The front desk girl did not even ask us if smoking room was ok. The curtains were the color of a dirty cigarette filter, and would not close using the string, you had to force them closed by hand. The screen in the window was ripped. There was blood splatter on the bathroom wall. The bathroom window overlooked the lovley smelling garbadge pails. Our bedsheet was greasy and looked like it a used noxema pad. I wonder if they even ever washed them. The sheets felt cheap and itchy. The blanket had burn holes in it. The furniture had burn marks on it from people who left cigarretts there. The room was 9x10, maybe, and there were 5 ashtrays in it. Who the hell needs 5 ashtrays in a room that small. And why would you give a couple a two bed room? We will be sleeping in the same bed. The pool was freezing. Why couldn't they atleast turn ON the heat? The one saving grace is the continental breakfast. I have never seen such a nice spread for a free breakfast. So we were roped in by a bargain discount, and if we had stayed in a regular room, not the bungalows, I think our stay would have been ok.

When we arrived at Old Town about 12:30 pm, Lela advised us that our room was ready for early check-in. What a great way to start our holiday! The Inn is very convenient to most San Diego attractions and they give you typed driving and walking instructions to these attractions. The continental breakfast is very good but the breakfast room does get crowded. The pool is heated and is nicely landscaped. We made good use of it to sun and read a book. The staff are most helpful with suggestions about what to see and where to eat. Erika recommended Casa De Pico at Bazaar Del Mundo in Old Town for Mexican food and very large margaritas. We were not disappointed. Old Town Inn is a mini oasis located in an industrial part of San Diego.

His helpfulness and pleasant voice on the phone is what made me decide to book this Inn....not to mention the reasonable price.

It is five minutes from Bazaar Del Mundo and The Old Town Historical Park. I felt VERY safe in this Inn and was not uncomfortable returning from the Park on foot at night, unlike being out after dark in Northern CA. The continental breakfast was a nice start to our busy day, but they do get busy. I had made reservations for two nights via telephone a few weeks in advance but got into town a night early. We were able to get a room a night early but we did have to switch rooms the following day because the Inn was booked solid. The night person seemed friendly on the phone when I called to see if they had a room and explained that we had reservations for the following two nights, but when we got there, he seemed like we were putting him out. (This was the ONLY glitch in our stay.) The following day when we came back from Sea World and registered for our reserved room, \"something had happened\" to our reservations and the staff upgraded our room at no additional charge. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the flower gardens and fountain were beautiful, the lobby was very cozy and inviting, the Inn has LOTS of information on attractions on in the area, the breakfast was nicely stocked and very welcome in the busy moring.
