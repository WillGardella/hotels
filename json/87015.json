Had requested non-smoking room. Got smoking room. Hotel said they didn't have any non-smoking rooms. Very small room with twin beds. Dirty drapes with cigarette burns. Window airconditioner. No alarm clock or radio. No hair dryer. Packet of coffee in room is $1.56. Ice is twenty five cents. Cockroach on ceiling. No restaurant. Drab hallways that need painting. Hotel is old and dingy. Would not recommend this hotel.", "Date": "Mar 28, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR945257918", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Great Place If You're On A Budget This is a great hotel for someone on a budget. I actually paid around $250 for four nights. Not too shabby for a place I only slept at during my visit to Honolulu. It was definitely within walking distance of the beach and other areas. True, this is not a Hyatt or Hilton, but rather along the lines of an older Holiday Inn perhaps. The halls are definitely line with worn carpet and funky pink paint. I stayed on the 21st floor and had a fun view of the city/mountains/canal. The staff was very friendly but the elevators old and slow. I think I would stay there again, but if traveling with my wife, I may drop a few extra bucks and go someplace a bit nicer.", "Date": "Feb 19, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR348329460", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Good Value for Money I stayed at this hotel for 9 nights. It is a basic budget hotel but clean. I felt safe there due to the security cards required for the elevator and the security guard at night (good place for single women to stay). The phone calls are expensive 0.75 cents per call. The only drawback is it is a loooooong walk to the beach and amenities but it is away from the hussle and bussle and is quiet. It is also close to the Ala Moana shopping centre. I would stay there again but it is good value for the money.
