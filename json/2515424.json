We arrived at 4:30 (later than we expected), so we were in a rush to check-in, drop our stuff off and head to meet everyone at the Padres game. When we get to the hotel it seemed like the hotel would be awesome because we were greeted by super friendly valet staff. Our bags were picked up for us and when I was ready to check-in, I was told the room was not ready. The advertised time for check in is 4:00pm and it is about 4:35pm, so I keep my patience and was told it should be very soon that they are just finishing up. While we're waiting in the lobby, we figured we can't waste anymore time waiting on them we were about to head out to the game at 5:00pm. However, as I was about to leave I received the call that the room was ready. We decided to go ahead and get settled as quickly as possible so we wouldn't have to do it when we get back. I finally got to check in at 5:00pm (an hour later than the advertised time) and gave my ticket to the concierge person to get our bags up and she said they'll be there right away. However, I wait 15 minutes and they're still not there. I call the concierge and am told that \"they should be on their way.\" At this point I am losing my patience because my plans are thrown off because of the hotel. I called back 10 minutes later and tell him that I NEED my bags because we have to get to the game that started at 5:35pm. They still did not come and after another ten minutes I called back and was told the same thing. Finally, I went downstairs to make sure that they were not sitting in their holding area. Basically, my plans were thrown off an hour because of the hotel and this should have not have been the case. Half an hour was wasted because the room was not ready until 5 and another half an hour was wasted because our bags did not get there until 5:30 and the game started at 5:35; in addition, we had a lot of people waiting on us. For spending $300 a night this is not what I had expected nor wish to have experienced especially on someone's birthday. I could have stayed at a motel for this kind of service. Also, the bell boys were rude. When we initially decided to just leave to the game without checking in, we had to grab stuff from our bags and one of them had to supervise us. He had an annoyed face and was not friendly at all (I'm sure because we were delaying him from getting his tips from other people), but that would not be happening if our room were ready as advertised.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cFun time, great deal\u201d", "Author": "odieflem", "ReviewID": "UR127538018", "Content": "We stayed for opening weekend of Padres with a great special of $99.

The shower was nice on the other end because the water came from both the top and from an angle. Our room faced the side where baseball standium was and had an ipod ready hook up in there as well. the room had a curtain that seperated the room from the den which i thought was lovely because i could keep my personals left out with out any one going into the room and being worried about anything.

I checked in on a Saturday and was astonished at the mass of people in the place - almost zoo-like. I was also annoyed that guests have to pay a cover charge just to get in the overcrowded hotel bars on the weekend. Our company spent well into 6 figures for a meeting here, but there are no benefits given for doing that, like access to the hotel bar. The place caters to the public and not to guests on weekends. I wasn't there on a Friday to see what that's like, but forget trying to sleep on a Saturday night. There were people going in and out of rooms and screaming in the hallways all night long, finally quieting down at 6 am. I thought this was going to be a long week at the place. Rating the hotel 2 stars at this point. What a difference a day makes. By Sunday afternoon, spring break at Ft. Lauderdale was over and the loud drunk 20-somethings were gone and the place was more normal. The Club 207 bar on the ground floor was a disappointment repeatedly. On a couple of nights almost immediately after pouring our group many drinks, bouncers drove everyone out of the place in a not very cool way at what seemed to be random times, once just after 12:30. I guess take the money and treat people poorly is the business strategy here. Rooms at the place are nice and the housekeeping quality is good. Good shower with rain head. The meeting facilities were one of the highlights of the property. Everything was well organized and the catering was good, with the exception of the lunches being held in tents in an area nearby the pool where the temperature was uncomfortably cold for most people.

I was overall very pleased with the experience. Here are some details: Check-in: I got the VIP check-in since I booked the trip on Expedia.com where I am an elite member. Basically, this consists of being taken to the \"Green Room\" where they will give you a drink of your choice during check-in, as well as a free room upgrade. This last part didn't happen because they were full. They told me to check on Friday to see if another room is available, but I never did. I requested a quiet room and got room 705, with pool-view. I didn't realize the first night that my window was open a few inches, letting in the train whistle sound at 3 am. After I closed this, the room was quiet enough. They ask what type of music you prefer at check-in. I requested a free in-room guitar for my stay. You get to pick 3 guitars from a menu and they bring you one of them. For me, none of my 3 choices were available, so they sent me a Fender Telecaster. Being a guitarist, this was a cool perk. I did have to wait about 15 minutes for my room to be ready, although I checked in right at 3pm. Room: They have your favorite style of music playing in the room on your arrival, which is very cool. The room is laid out with rock art work/imagery, lots of alcohol in and out of the fridge, guitar pick sticker on toilet paper roll, etc. I enjoyed all this minus the alcohol, because of the crazy mark-up on alcohol. There is no microwave in the room. We had 2 queen beds, flat screen tv with supposedly HD, but the picture was not in HD. I didn't order any in-room movies. The dual head shower was good and bad--good if you like/need both heads, bad because if you happen to turn one shower head off and turn it back on, it will disperse cold water first. I just left it on one shower head after a brief trial of both. Hard Rock bath scrubber was a nice touch. Gym: I used the gym 3 times during my 6 day stay. It had good upper/lower body machines, treadmills, free weights, etc. There's a flat-screen tv playing rock music videos. I especially liked \"Closer to the Heart\" by Rush that was played during one of my workouts. There are free towels and water available. The gym is located right next to the Rock Spa, where you could get facials/massages if you wanted to pay for them ($85-several hundred). Room service: not used 207 Club: VIP access before 10 pm, busy on Fridays/Saturdays. Pretty hip place, loud music as expected in a dance club. Overpriced drinks as expected. Mary Jane's, Nobu: not used Valet service: $37 per day, typical for Gaslamp Quarter hotels. I used it for the 3 days of my conference since my work reimburses, then used the much cheaper garage (with 24 hour access) behind the hotel.

I was there for a conference at the Convention Center. The Hard Rock is located directly across the street from it. It could not have been more convenient. The hotel is in excellent shape. The maintenance crew does an excellent job of keeping up with things. Check in was a breeze. *****However, make sure you understand their resort fee policy (apprx. $17 per day). Apparently this fee is added to your room charges depending upon which method/portal that is used to make your reservation. My understanding is that the fee covers your internet and local calls. If you need to use a computer, the Business Center in the hotel has 4 available for use for no additional fee. There is also a printer available. Rooms: I stayed in single queen bed layout. It was a decent sized room with a huge bathroom. The bed was comfortable but nothing extraordinary. The pillows were okay too. The shower has a rain head spray fixture and a wall spray fixture. You can control the flow to them as you prefer. The water pressure was great and the water hot. I LOVED THE SHOWER!!! I did not want to get out. Room Location: There are some complaints about noise posted by some reviewers. ****Things to know: The quieter rooms are located along the outside perimeter of the hotel along 6th and K streets. The rooms that are even numbered are located along those streets. THE EXCEPTION - rooms that are even numbered starting with 00 -22 (I think} are located along the street for the front lobby and nightclub. Those are definitely louder ( friends stayed in those rooms and related this to me} The odd number rooms face the pool area and 5th street. They tend to be louder. Staff: I can say without exception that every staff member I encountered was friendly and professional. All seemed to be young and interested in making sure my stay was an enjoyable one. Food: I ate several meals Mary Jane's. Most were for breakfast, with one Happy Hour visit. The service was quick and the food was not your typical food service dreck. Quality ingredients, fresh squeezed orange juice and Star Bucks coffee. MY ONE complaint: they did not have Light Cream for the coffee, which I prefer. I settled for the half and half. Overall: I feel the hotel is geared to a younger progressive clientele. That being said, there people of all ages staying there. Please don't go there thinking it will be a Ritz/Hilton vibe. There is no Muzak on the elevators. There is a steady stream of rock music played through out the hotel. The Hard Rock reminded me of a W Hotel only better.

His company had their Christmas ball here last year (2010) and we were excited to have a weekend to ourselves. There were discounted rooms available, but we opted for a more special experience as we did last year and booked one of the Rock star suites. We incidentally had the exact same room last year so we knew what to expect. The room was $300 more per night than the company discounted rooms. We of course expect there to be some noise as we were above the club and things did quiet down around the expected closing time. Although I am trying convey some positive aspects, I feel compelled to tell the public what terrible customer service we received when we complained about a basic necessity. We stayed for two nights. The first night, our speakers and Tv remotes weren't working so we had a technician attempt to fix things, which he did, but never came back with the remote. When they did bring one back, it was the wrong one. We had lukewarm water that only became lukewarm after running for over twenty minutes, including the bathtub. But the worst part was that for the remainder of our stay we had no hot water (freezing cold only) despite having service technicians in the room while we were trying to get ready, and then being told it was fixed when it clearly was not. We were offered a new room at 11:30 pm Saturday night and were checking out the next am. When we very politely complained about the hot water, we were offered a comp at breakfast before checkout. In addition, there was a large party on the balcony room below us....loud, but expected. However, we had to call security to have them stop a fight with someone attempting to jump from the balcony. The bottom line is that we were more than willing to give you our money for a more \"rock star\" experience, but were given a small deduction from our total bill, that a true rock star would have never tolerated.

There was a glitch in the system and apparently Im not one of those who receieved the 1st ten. However the manager Luke was kind enough to give me a great deal and upgrade my room to a Hard Rock Suite. And another manager/director Michelle went above and beyond in helping me with all of my needs. I had to say I was very upset at first because I already planned a huge reservation and was dissapointed with the sudden change of rate but they did everything in their power to compensate. I was planning a small get together for me and my friends and the small private lounge area at the room was perfect. They even tried to find me another room with a balcony however they were fully booked for the weekend During check in Courtney was very helpful in my booking, she tried to book me with a room w/ a balcony but later moved me at my request to another floor since the balcony had no view ( all wall) and gave me one with a spectacular view. Jeff and Ronnie helped with my VIP list for 207 and Float for the 2 nights which impressed my friends. I really felt like a rockstar complete with my entourage. The Rock Spa was amazing!!! Dolusa got all the kinks that has been bothering me for weeks and will highly recommend her. I love my room even the mini bar and the private bar that I have though I could not use them due to it being overpriced for me The Cons: As expected being a Hard Rock hotel in the middle of Gaslamp the #1 issue I had was the noise from other hard partying groups and the drunken patrons at the lobby area. being a girl who sometimes need to come down at Mary Janes or Nobu to grab a bite. Its difficult not to get bothered by a few drunk males or so, even at the elevator. My room was booked right next to a suite that had security called throughout their stay due to noise issues There was a snaffu with my inhouse credit as 2 other front desk agents needed to make sure/verify I had one as they nearly charged me an extra $50 at my final bill. After some show of proof from my confirmation emails that was all settled but did caused me to worry a bit There were some channels that were all \"paid programming\" and the Travel channel was just looping forever with Direct TV instructions. Not all windows are tinted so people from the other street can actually see you. And you seing them as one guy from an ajacent condo lasered us. The showers were amazing at the room but I think a shower curtain would be great as the angle of the shower head hits the dry area and tend to flood it with water Club 207 was great but i think they need to expand that club more as it was overly crowded in such small area space The Pros: Right snak in the heart of Gaslamp, we werent far from other eateries like pizza and ice cream which I can easily walk to, and the trolley could take us striaght to Old Town and Little Italy The curtain dividers was genius as it gave thisw sense of privace from the lounge area (Hard Rock Suite) I had one of the guitars sent out to my room and that was a riot to my friends to have one of the Fenders to be brought up for no cost at all. Massage at the Spa was AWSOME and wished the open the steam room earlier than 9:00am as I would love to use it after a 7 am workout The minibar and view were definate bragging rights to my friends and you have no idea all the compliments I got. And envy looks. The staff especially the security was awesome. Even some of the bouncers were nice I was treated like a rockstar by the people there. Though it would be nice a complimentary breakfast would be included in some of the packages Overall I would Give the Hard Rock a 3.5-4 out of 5 stars. I am definately returning next year for an event and will try the Hard Rock Suites this time.

Saturday night was a bit better, but still the same type of clientele, young drunk hipsters.

My main issue with this place is the deafening and ubiquitous music played everywhere such that a good night's rest is a gamble depending on the location of your room. Nevertheless, there are positives: the hotel provides sleek accommodation to a high standard. The beds and pillows are very comfortable, the room cleanliness is one of the best I have seen. The rooftop terrace looks nice. However, I tried to spend as little time as possible here. You walk in, and there is loud music, anytime. While the rooftop terrace (the float) could be nice, it is impossible to enjoy or talk to your colleague without shouting. Even at the pool during the day the TV is on and you have to listen to it since next to each 'lounger' there is a loudspeaker. The pool is tiny and while the cushions etc look nice, they are actually uncomfortable and way too few. The float gets frequently used as a party venue so use as a guest is difficult at best and good luck to you if your room faces the float. Next the rooms. After you found your way through the darkest possible hotel corridors devoid of any decoration, you are welcomed by a huge open liquor bar proffering alcohol at 40 USD / bottle as well as 'artisan' water for 10USD. I found this pretentious non-sense. However, there is also a kiosk next to your in-room liquor store: a huge variety of overpriced snacks, condoms, assorted sex 'accessories' for the want of a better description, candles etc await you on open display in case you have forgotten or casually feel like grabbing one. Breakfast: poor quality and overpriced. The menu has been put together by an overly excited marketing apprentice. Difficult to actually figure out what all these silly names refer to, masking little choice. No buffet, eggs invariably undercooked, bacon not crispy, rosti/ hashbrown was undercooked and came with a huge slab of watermelon on top, brown toast was no toast and hard as a rock. Wow. They 'proudly' serve Starbucks Coffee but they can't brew it like Starbucks. As special features you get free playlists, free online tourist info but internet is 15 USD/ day; I found those things of low value but you do get USA today for free. The do not disturb sign actually reads 'my ego needs a rest' which may have added to the confusion of housekeeping as to the meaning since they frequently checked despite this sign out. Staff are friendly and helpful but dressed as night club bouncers. It is obvious that the concept behind HR hotels doesn't work for me. I happily spent my time and money at the Marriot Marina, which has a decent pool, pool bar, a good restaurant, quiet zones if you want, a concierge who actually knows the job of a concierge. Most importantly, I didn't get the feeling the hotel was trying hard to make me feel like the 17y old teenager who really wants to be treated like special celebrity on a night out.

The primary purpose of our trip was to attend a couple of Padres games. We found a good rate on one of the hotel consolidator websites - and called the hotel to ask a question about the rate. I was told the hotel would match the rate - it was nice dealing with the hotel on the reservation and not through a third party. I had e-mailed the hotel before our trip to ask for a quiet room. We were assigned room 1228 and this room, on the top floor, clearly met our needs. Our room had a view of Petco Park - which was great considering our trip was a baseball trip. We did stay Wednesday through Friday nights - we had no noise issues at all. The hotel was generally quiet on Wednesday and Thursday nights - Friday night had a lot going on but it was still quiet in our room. The beds were comfortable, the pillows were soft. The flat screen TV set to music when we first entered - a nice touch. The room was not large, but not especially cramped. The air conditioning worked fine - although San Diego was very temperate when we visited. The bathroom was larger than many hotel bathrroms, although counter space was limited. The sink was large, the shower had excellent water pressure. The towels were plush and the toiletries were good. A few things could have been better: The desk area was very small and the snacks and alcohol for sale took up much of the room that was available. There were only two drawers for clothes along with an armoire attached to the wall. We had luggage for 12 nights - it was somewhat crowded in our room. We had numerous wi-fi issues. The hotels home page was taking 80 seconds to load. We visited the concierge to ask what could be done better and her answer was to \"visit the coffee shop across the street.\" At $17 per night for the \"in-charge\" fee this answer was totally unacceptable. We eventually e-mailed the assistant manager of the hotel in an attempt to get a resolution. We were advised that there was a problem with the router on our floor, that their tech group had fixed it and that the $17 per night charge would be reversed from our bill. The internet was much faster but still hesitated. We were grateful for the response for the manager, but the flippant answer from the concierge led us not to use it again. The hotel coffee shop was similar to many of the restaurants we found in the Gaslamp Quarter - very expensive. We never did eat there as they did not serve lunch early enough for our daily schedule and were closed by the time we returned in the evening. The hotel was only two blocks from Petco Park - very convenient. The trolley stops outside the front door of the hotel - again very convenient. Would I stay here again if I returned to San Diego? Yes, but I would also price shop - there are many hotels nearby. We really looked forward to visiting this hotel more than any of the other five on our trip.

We stayed here 5 days from from August 13 to August 18. My boy friend now fiancee proposed to me in our rock star suite on the first night!! FLIGHT: We flew from Toronto via Air Canada. Everything was on time. No in flight meal included but they sell sandwiches on board and snacks and offer free beverages. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich it was decent. ARRIVAL: San diego airport wasn't as busy as I expected and nothing spectacular. We needed a taxi to the hotel so when you head out follow the signs and theres a booth with a person dispatching taxis on a first come first serve basis. So no need to haul down or call ahead they do all the work for you and there is a slew of taxis outside waiting for customers. CHECK IN: As we pulled up the vallets welcomed us and helped us take out our luggage from the taxi and portered it to the check in desk. As we entered the hotel was pretty busy with others checking in and they were playing rock music in the background. The concerige lady was really nice but we were early so the room wasn't ready yet. Check in wasnt until 4pm and we were there at 1pm. She took our cell number and said she would call us when the room was ready if we wanted to go out have a bite to eat or explore around. Across the street was a fish taco restaurant called Tin Fish so we just headed over there. The concerige tagged our suitcases and kept it behind the desk for us. When we returned from lunch the concerige called us over to let us know our room was ready and the porter brought our suitcases up shortly after. ROOM: We stayed in a Rock Star Suite on the 7th Floor room 701 it was at the end of the hallway. The room completely knocked our socks off! Just gorgous!! The bathroom had duel shower heads with a beautiful bowl sink. The living room had white leather couches, flat screen tv with bose surround sound system and was playing house music when we entered just as we requested. The bedroom had a huge comfy bed with 4 plush pillows and another flat screen tv. The floor to ceiling windows that surrounded the entire left side of the room back wall was gorgous. Our room overlooked float and the pool and we could see the convention centre. Just beautiful views. The mini bar was stocked with alcohol and pop/juice as well as snack foods and wine. PEOPLE: All the staff here were amazing. They were all spunky and upbeat and very polite. They all went the extra mile to help us out. A room service girl brought me up chips on the house because I thought they came with the meal and she said no probelm i'll just send some up! Special shout out to Courtney who made our stay extra special always greeting us with a warm smile and helpful tips. She helped my fiancee plan out how to propose and sent us up chocolate covered strawberries and a lovely card. Brian who brought us room service also a very sweet guy and sent us a bottle of champagne to celebrate. Our housekeeper greeted us everyday and left our room spotless! THE FOOD: Room service at this hotel is amazing! They have a wide selection of apps, sandwiches, hot entrees, snacks, desserts, and drinks. We ordered a magarita pizza which came hot and bubbly super good! We also had the grilled cheese which came with a tomato and leek bisque (loved this soup) and homemade chips (best chips ever) and we paid $2 extra for the fries. Room service is pricey total worth it because the portions are HUGE and the food always came quickly and piping hot! You can just leave your tray outside the room or call roomservice to pick it up for you. We also dined at Nobu (located in the lobby) which is fusion and japenese cuisine. Amazing food and gorgous restaurant! We also ate at Mary Janes once for breakfast.....typical breakfast. ENTERTAINMENT: FYI this is a PARTY hotel! The party never stops here something is always going on. I don't recommened this hotel for those who want to go to bed early or have small children. Saturday night the club 207 is packed you can come early and pay cover (free if your in a rock star suite) and get your hand stamped and then come in through the VIP entrance later on. Sunday is there pool party called Intervention with a live DJ and the whole pool deck and back of the hotel is jam packed with young adults drinking in bikinis and partying. LiL John was the guest DJ when we were there and it was SooOoo much FuNNN everyone was going crazy!! The pool and hot tub is very beautiful they say you have to pay to rent a day bed but if you go during the week its pretty dead and you sit anywhere. They have a gym which is pretty small which we never used. Definately head outside 5th avenue is always lively and jam packed with beautiful restaurants and shops, go to pecto park and see the Padres, the San Diego is a short taxi ride away and definately worth the visit, the horton plaza mall is a short walk away and a lovely outdoor mall.

Very little water pressure and just not set up well. Its a rain fall set up, which doesnt work well with little water pressure. So on noise. The rooms aren't bad in terms of noise, but you can hear it from downstairs if a band is playing. The drums are a bit loud. The pool area is really small. It is a want to be vegas setup. But is very cozy. We went down their for outrageously priced drinks. The music sucked. It was basically bad house music with no real differences. the atmosphere was ok, but again, music was really bad. I hear sundays have great pool parties. We did run into little jon, who was playing on sunday, but didnt stay to check it out. In terms of location and view. Location is ok as it is at the start of the gas lamp.

There was a long line at check-in but people need to grasp the concept of using easy check-out to allow those checking in to complete the process. My ONLY recommendation would be to add a few more check-in lanes to assist during the busy times. The room was awesome (I know I am very enthusiastic about this property). I stayed in a King Suite and it was spacious, clean and worth every penny. They are also a little funky in a good way. Not your average room. Float and 207 (the 2 clubs/bars) on property are great as well. Not only is the staff friendly (and easy on the eyes) but they are top notch servers.

It was crawling with A list celebrities. I thoroughly enjoyed staying there and my friends and I are definitely staying there when we go back next year.

The TV's have a user-friendly input for connecting mp3 players, laptops, etc. to the TV. Guests receive free entry into the clubs/bars on property before 10 PM.

If it is just a room you are looking for I'd head to the Hilton next door. Their loft suites are about the same price and are four times as large. Maybe not as trendy but you get the same location.

Rooms are edgy and fresh, they play your choice of music upon entry too to continue with the rockstar theme, its shnazzy. Anyway, absolutely recommending it looking to stay downtown, its a short stroll to the best nightlife in downtown and has a Nobu in the hotel!", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPERFECT Hotel, perfect location, better for the young & restless!\u201d", "Author": "kamvissi", "ReviewID": "UR115456749", "Content": "I stayed for the second time at this hotel, like last time an excellent experience.

We travelled down to San Diego from Annaheim, and got there at about 1130am - check in was not supposed to be until 3pm. Thankfully, the staff at the hotel were happy to check us in early. At the check in desk we were asked what kind of music we enjoyed, which made sense once we got up to the room and the TVs were set to play music based on our preferences (a nice touch!) I really liked the room - we had a room on the third floor that consisted of a big king sized bed, a separate sofa/lounge area (with TVs in each area) and a bathroom & shower. The only thing I did not like about the room was the fact that the toilet door, and shower wall & door were both see through. Granted they were not 100% clear, but there was still enough to see who was inside of each room and what they were doing! I'm not sure if this was deemed to be trendy, but this was my main dislike about the rooms! The hotel itself was only a block away from Petco Park where the Padres play - we went to watch a game on our first day there. It was also extremely close to a number of bars and restaurants on the main streets of San Diego. The decor of the hotel seemed nice - I liked the memorabilia as you get with other Hard Rock locations. We ate at Mary Jane's once on our stay and this was a pleasant visit. The portion sizes were huge though and we had to ask for a container to take our uneaten food back up to the hotel room. We did not drink at any of the bars - 207, although loud when we went past seemed very empty (This was a Thursday night). We visited the pool once on our stay, but the atmosphere was not quite as relaxing as I'd have liked - really it's like a party pool with lots of young, hip adults drinking in the pool etc. This didn't offend me, but I could understand why it would put of any families with younger children, or older guests who would be staying at the hotel Overall though I'd still recommend the hotel - it was a pleasant stay and I'd happily stay there again!", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cWhat an Awesome Time!\u201d", "Author": "CSF18768", "ReviewID": "UR115232070", "Content": "Anytime I go back to San Diego, I will stay at The Hard Rock Hotel.

Be careful about what room you get. Here, the suites seem to mean that they are not overlooking the courtyard/club. All other rooms are. We were initially in one of those loft rooms and even on a Thursday it was terrible. The courtyard turns into a club and the noise level is tremendous. It's like there is a party in your room - it is SO loud. I finally decided to upgrade to a suite and that was not handled well. For 4 hours my husband was told it was \"about to happen\" which meant he wasted most of the day waiting and wasn't able to leave the hotel. If they had been honest and said \"we'll move you at 2\" he could have at least left the hotel. They provided a pack n' play for our daughter with a nice kit of Johnson and Johnson products which was a nice touch but this is clearly not a hotel geared towards families. I was excited about the pool but it's a party pool. I wouldn't have been comfortable bringing a child into the pool. Not because it wasn't safe but because the other people there are in a party frame of mind. At many other hotels this wouldn't have been an issue. Friday and Saturday night there were parties ALL OVER the hotel in private rooms and therefore a lot of drunk people all over the hotel. The suite rooms are definitely worth the upgrade and the sound proofing is far superior to other hotels. Additionally, the fact that you have to use your card in the elevator is really annoying. There seems to be an expectation from other people using the elevator that you will use your card to let them up. If you are in your 20's (or a 20's frame of mind) this hotel would be great.

I chose the Hard Rock Hotel San Diego because I am a fan of the Hard Rock franchise, the location is great and I wanted an experience for the money. Hotels in downtown San Diego aren't cheap (not exactly New York's Time Square prices, though), but for the rate it's worth it to stay where there's a nightlife. I've stayed at the Hard Rock Las Vegas, which sets the bar for the Rock-themed hotel experience (not including the casino). The advantage of HR San Diego is the location and the amenities. The pool and bar are above average, and both have uncompromising views of the cityscape. The hotel is across from the convention center, which is a huge advantage for certain times of the year, like the annual, famous Comic-Con. (Not to mention, one of the best, cheapest fish restaurants is directly across the street -- Tin Fish. A local legend. 20 steps across from the front entrance.) I stayed in the Suite, which I chose for the view. It's a great room for couples -- but, if you want to save money and can skip the view, stay in the standard room. There are higher level suites with balconies available, which have views of the cityscape and bay. The Suite had 2 flat screen TVs, your choice of genre rock music pumped in, a nice amenities bar & fridge and a stylish bath & shower area. On the property, there is a cool diner named Mary Jane's. The food is good, but don't confuse this with the legendary Hard Rock restaurant. There is a Hard Rock San Diego restaurant located about 6 short blocks away, around the corner and up 4th street. That was the only disappointment -- I always hoped the real HR restaurant would be in the hotel. (I think this is because the HR restaurant was relocated from La Jolla a number of years ago, and likely pre-dates the HR Hotel.) There was a moderately-sized convention going on in the hotel during my stay, and I got no sense that the place was overcrowded or too noisy. This may be different during Comic-Con. I know that there are other hotels on the far side of the convention center that specialize in large business meetings, and guests get the sense that the place is overcrowded. Not so at the HR Hotel. Last, but not least, the best advantage of the HR Hotel SD is the location. Guests can walk out the side entrance of the hotel on Fifth Street and find an abundance of restaurants and shops along the Gaslamp. (Not to mention the Brewer's baseball stadium on the other side of the hotel.) If you are staying in downtown SD, the Gaslamp is the scene, and there are many Gaslamp events throughout the year. Given this location, if you are willing to spend a little extra for the environment, the Hard Rock Hotel San Diego should be your choice.", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas TX", "Title": "\u201cNot the \"Relaxing and Restful\" stay we had hoped for\u201d", "Author": "LinzDiane", "ReviewID": "UR110238706", "Content": "I guess we knew when booking the room this hotel would cater to the younger crowd and tourists.

I'd taken three planes to get there and seeing his friendly face at the end of a very long day was exactly how I wanted to start my week. I traveled alone and felt perfectly safe and welcomed at 207 and Maryjane's at all times of the day and evening. The hotel is situated perfectly, across from the trolley that runs along the waterfront, to Old Town, to Gillespie Field, and even as far south as the border but that's not all. You're also at the gateway to the Gaslamp quarter (literally) with many MORE amazing and funky restaurants, bars, clubs and boutiques. I kept telling myself I would definitely come back on vacation with family to really explore the area and wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Hard Rock again. My room overlooked Tin Fish Restaurant and the trolley stop across from the Convention Center. I was also a two block walk to Petco Park for the local Padres ballgame. I did hear the trolley bell occasionally, but from what I heard from others at the convention, my room was desireable on party nights at Float. I guess in rooms overlooking that area, things did get a bit loud. Convention rooms were comfortable, centrally located, and all equipment we needed, from sound systems, to meals, to screens and projectors worked as promised. Also, a tiny detail, I love the one touch call for everything I needed in my room, Ground Control was all I needed to contact other rooms, ask questions about service and facilities, or check on extending my checkout. I didn't use the pool, but loved Float as a place to hang out in the late afternoon for a pre-dinner drink and a bit of sunshine. SO comfortable and relaxed.

The staff is very young so it is impressive that the service was so above standard... it renews your faith in the younger generation in some ways. Having said that, as a family of five with children under 12, we'd probably never go back here. We stayed at this hotel because we had a room there free of charge through an art auction company who was holding an event at the hotel. The hotel is filled with young drunk people 24/7. I will say they've insulated the walls very well because other than hearing them come down the corridors, we heard nothing from the adjacent rooms even though there were 20+ people going in and out at all hours. I'm not sure what happened in one of the elevators on Saturday night, but on Sunday they had stationed an elevator attendant on each lift because of an \"issue\" that took place the night before. I'm happy the hotel responded appropriately to whatever that event was and took steps to correct it by staffing the elevator... but weren't surprised there was an event given the large number of young partiers staying at the hotel. If I were 20 years younger (I'm 42) this would be the place I want to be, but I'm too old to worry about getting puked on or bashed into by someone unable to walk without assistance. Sigh.

The pool was a bar scene from about mid day well into the night but despite that, the security staff went out of their way (A gentleman named Alaska in particular) to make us feel welcome and specifically told us if anyone had \"any problems\" with the kids there swimming to just let him know and he would \"take care of it.\" We felt welcome and were treated very well by the staff- I can't say it enough, the staff really is well trained and did a great job throughout our stay. The hotel location is the BEST we've ever had in San Diego. You are a city block from Petco Park, across the street from the Convention Center and on the corner of the start of the Gaslamp district. There are a lot of homeless around and quite a lot of unsavory types... I've been to NYC and DC and couldn't believe how much cleaner and safer those cities were compared to downtown San Diego. (That is a city of San Diego issue, not a Hard Rock hotel issue, however.) City of San Diego needs to do a better job with getting uniformed officers on the street down there... tons of cops in cars, but they need them on bikes/horseback/foot like the other big cities do to really police that area better. (We had no problems, however, there was a random shooting--husband shot his wife- in the gaslamp quarter six blocks from the hotel in broad daylight the weekend we were there. Also- the coceierge at the hotel adamantly advised against riding the SD trolley light rail near or after nightfall.... it just isn't safe, she said.) Our first room had a window looking out toward the convention center. We moved to a slightly larger room for $30 more which had a sliding glass door with a rail (not really a balcony, but you could open the sliders and look out) and the room was MUCH nicer with a small sitting area, couch and two TVs rather than one. Pay the $30 more for the room with the sliding glass door... it is nice to take in the city and well worth the money for the updgrade. Food: The food at Nobu was gross... how does anyone eat there? The breakfast at Maryjanes was good but VERY expensive. Room service was also pricey, but good food and we were hungry so no complaints there. Overall- we enjoyed our stay but I would only recc this hotel to someone single and under 35 looking to drink, party and meet people.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Doncaster, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed ... and not sure why\u201d", "Author": "GreedyIan", "ReviewID": "UR108144425", "Content": "I was expecting something special from this hotel and it just didn't deliver.

I left a very positive review about my stay, but shared my concern about this \"IN FEE\", and didn't really expect to hear back from anyone. But I was wrong. Amanda Hess, their Rock Royalty Manager emailed me, and when I told her the details, she credited the amount. Kudos to how a hotel should be run.

They did not offer discount or anything for the inconvenience until we complained to a manager I was handed toilet paper to put in the bathroom myself.

We paid money to stay in a very nice hotel and expected to be treated a whole lot better than we were. When we called a manager to complain about the security we were told that there are 2 sides to the story and given a complimentary drink to solve the problem and my friend was stating that this is the worst hotel she's ever stayed at and another lady walking by said I agree.The staff was unfriendly with the exception of the bell service.

To make it worse i was pregnant and needed to use it several times a day. I actually had to finish my business outside the hotel because i couldnt stand them. Also the toilets are encassed in a glass wall, you can definately see someone in there doing their business. I tested it with my friend and i could clearly tell the colour of her underwear.

Also if you would like to rent a car while in San Diego, we went to the concierge and asked how we should rent one. The concierge made a phone call and 10 minutes later enterprise was picking us up taking us to their office a few blocks away to get a car for the day for $39.

The reason I rated sleep quality very low is due to the proximity to the train tracks (brutally close to passenger and freight trains who blow their horn regularly throughout the evening) and our room was right above bar 207 in the hotel which turns into a night club.

From the moment we checked in and were asked what kind of music we would like piped into our rooms, we knew it would be a fun experience. I stayed there for a long business trip, so having a fun atmosphere to come back to after work made staying in San Diego all the better. The rooms are beautifully designed and were very clean (I did happen upon a gentleman spraying for insects in the hallway but I'm assuming it was a preventative measure with the bed bug outbreak in hotels recently) . The bathroom includes a fantastic rain shower style shower head installed in the ceiling. My room didn't include a bathtub, which would have been really nice, but the shower was still great. The room is also obviously geared towards having fun as a couple as you can see from the \"special kit\" offered as an in-room concession. You have the option of hanging a breakfast request on your doorknob each night so it is automatically delivered to the room at whatever time in the am you designate. There is no in room coffee maker, so you'll have to order a carafe of coffee, otherwise you can pick up a cup in Mary Jane's in the lobby. The room service staff was friendly and courteous and welcoming. If you play guitar, you can also request a Gibson to be delivered to your room for a jam session! One tip: don't bother raiding the mini fridge or in room snacks--the pricing for them is exorbitant and its just as easy to hit the CVS a few blocks east of the hotel. The room service pricing is pretty expensive, but then again, most of the food is priced very high in San Diego. You do get very generous portions, however, and I believe the food is from Mary Jane's, which is the hotel restaurant that specializes in diner/comfort food. In the evening hours, you definitely feel like a VIP as you see hipsters lining up for entry into the swanky lobby club. Be warned: the Gaslamp nightlife can get loud, and my room was close enough to ground level to hear some drunk club-goers making trouble in the streets.

I booked the Queen Hard Rock Suite on travelocity for a great price of $185 (the room usually retails for $319 or so on Saturday nights!) We bypassed the insane $35 valet charge at the hotel and parked for $17 across the street (literally about 20 second from the hotel and half the price!) The desk agent was super sweet and helpful and we recieved great customer service from everyone at the hotel-- it's so different than the Hard Rock in vegas, where everyone that works there thinks they're better than you. The San Diego staff was great! Our Queen Suite was smaller than I expected but still nice. (However, if I had paid over $300 for it I would have been sick! Totally worth $185, totally NOT worth $300-$350!) The good: Super comfy beds, unique shower that was separate from the toliet, a GREAT view from our huge balcony and a nice lounge area that we used to get ready to go out in. Despite it being smaller than expected, it was still big enough for 4 girls to stay in without being cramped. We loved MaryJane's inside the hotel...what's better at 3 am than veggie chili fries?! Yum! The bad: The suite had no fridge....seriously? You get a fridge in your room at the Days Inn! For the price of the suite, they could have stuck a mini fridge somewhere in there! There's really no sink area or bathroom area to speak of in this suite so there's nowhere to get ready. We used the cocktail bar.

And if you think you too old for the Hard Rock Hotel, there was all ages in the hotel and teh clubs, bar area, swimming pool, etc. And Mary Janes restaurant in the hotel, makes the best 3 egg omlet and hash browns........ Do yourself a favor, whether business or pleasure, check into the Hard Rock Hotel San DIego, or wherever they may be in other cities, and I guarantee you won't go back to your other favorite hotels. When they say they are going to Rock your World with service above and beyond, they mean it!!!!

Before booking a room and read a lot of reviews on it and decided to give it a try. I got a really good deal from one of the emails the Hard Rock sends it, I recommend signing up for their emails since they send out great deals from time to time. I was able to get an awesome rate plus a $50 hotel credit for pretty much whatever (there was a couple of restrictions but nothing too bad). The staff was awesome. Right away at check in they made us feel special and very welcome. They gave us suggestions on their clubs and restaurants and also about getting on the \"VIP List\" for 207 (also recommended). Our room was great. We had a Hard Rock Suite. It had a very nice view of the city. One thing to look out for...the beds are lower to the ground and I dinged my ankle pretty good on the platform of the bed. MY OWN FAULT of course, but just something to watch out for. I really like how you can personalize the music station before you get to your room and have the music playing for you, you can also change it if you want, they had lots of stations. We ate dinner off site but returned after to get some drinks and dance at 207. If you plan on going later than 10pm, get on the list 1st when you check in. When we got back from dinner their was already a long line but we got right in because of the list. The next morning we ate at Mary Janes and it was great too. Great service and great food.

I am not a vodka drinker but it still made me smile. The hotel bars are all excellent locations to meet up with clients in a sophisticated yet informal location. Don't get too comfortable going to just one of the bars in the hotel because they are all unique, well-stocked and have great ambience. My favorite is the Float bar on the 4th floor that combines the hotel's swimming pool, hot tub, cabanas and huge sectional setting areas around aquamarine stone fire pits to take the chill off at night.

The room service was quick and the staff was very friendly! The quality of bath products that were supplied was very good. The bed was fine and had plenty of pillows! The shower was spectacular and soothing with great acoustics for those who want to rock out while you are in the shower. The nicest part of the stay was the fact that they take you to the airport in a towncar for $15...slightly cheaper than a taxi and much more pleasant.

Instead of garish decor with a \"loud party\" atmosphere, I was delighted to experience this as a cozy boutique hotel that is across the street from the convention center (other hotels in the area are the typical monstrosities found near large convention centers). In addition to easy access to the convention center, this property is located at the entrance to the historic and hip gaslight district which San Diego is well known for. So many restaurants to choose from within a few blocks, and plenty of shopping as well. I could see into Petco Field (home of the San Diego Padres) from my room, and I can imagine that game days might impact the ambiance, but I was thrilled with the area around the hotel. MaryJane's Cafe, located in the hotel, was a fun and funky place to grab a quick bite ($4,.20 burgers on Wednesdays after 4:20pm!), and I heard great things about the other eating establishments. (I hopped up the block to the Broken Yolk both mornings for UHMAZING breakfasts and ginormous diet Coke's). The front line staff were super friendly and helpful (I was up at 4am both mornings because I'm from the midwest, and the late night shift cleaning the floors were as good about making eye contact and greeting me with a warm hello as the desk staff and bell stand staff. Exceptional. I also had some interactions with management, and they were just over the top. Fitness center had 4 treadmills, 3 ellipticals and several weight-training machines. And it was available 24 hours (great for us folks from the midwest and east coast who are up insanely early!!).

The Hard Rock is probably the best situated boutique hotel nearest the main entrance to the Convention Center. It is at the entrance to the Gaslamp district with all of the restaurants in close proximity to the hotel. Check in and check out was professional and personal. Staff are young, friendly and put the guest first. My king bed room was compact but nicely furnished with a platform bed, innovative wet bar with 2 bar stools, a flat screen TV embedded in the customized desk, and a spacious bathroom with shower (but no tub). My room overlooked the lobby canopy and faced the convention center. Hallways were dark brown, lit by flourescent lights and seemed cheap compared to the room furnishings. The small rooftop pool was sufficient for laps and was surrounded by about 8 queensized loungers for sunning. The small pool deck was adjacent to the bar making this area very loud with music, drinking and socializing. Not really an environment for family kiddie play on weekends. The gym was decent in size and had a variety of aerobic and weight machines. Guests could access the sauna inside the Spa but only by paying a fee and only when the Spa was open. The hotel and Gaslamp district in general are party central on weekends, so those wanting to sleep early best avoid the area. The ballpark is about a block away and makes for a busy and active place on game days. Plenty of bars and restaurants in the area, and public light rail line stops in front of the lobby entrance.

Very chic/european styled room with lots of great little Hard Rock touches including a pillowcase with a guitar embroidered on it. As I mentioned before, classic rock was playing through the TV which was integrated into a great modern entertainment center with from AV jacks to hook up whatever your heart desired to the TV. The most impressive thing about the room was the bathroom. Not only was is super swanky with a glass enclosed stand up shower with 2 heads (rain, regular), it had to have been the cleanest hotel bathroom I've ever set foot in.

As I always do I have broken my review down into the Great, Good, Bad, and Ugly. I will also offer some bottom line-type comments. Ready? Here goes . . . GREAT * DESIGN - okay, the design environment of the Hard Rock San Diego (henceforth referred to as HRSD) is very 'manufactured' and we know it but this hotel is an excellent mix of chic and sophistication where business people, partiers, and vacationers blend seemlessly - nobody feeling out of place. I loved the giant screen backdrop to the registration counters as well as the unique design of the rooms - backlit trim and unique furniture and bar designs help make an otherwise standard footprint room unique. This holds true to the rest of the building and common areas as well - dramatic lighting, 3D prominent song lyric quotes, and eclectic design all mean that you will remember the HRSD long after your stay. * LOCATION - Whether you are in town for a trade show or to have fun, go ahead . . . just TRY to top this location. The hotel is just across the street from the convention center on one side, and almost under the iconic arch that signals the beginning of the gaslamp main drag on the other. And to yet another side . . . you are a pop fly's distance from Petco Park. GOOD * TEMPERATURE / SOUND - I mentioned the unique design of the rooms. But, that's not all. I found the room temperature controls to be excellent while running more quietly than most. And . . . I had to unfortunately participate in an impromtu conference call from my room in the early a.m. and found the room to be highly sound proof. I didn't hear toilets or TVs from other rooms and nobody had to hear me talking about TPS reports and mission statements from their room. * SHOWER - The shower was fantastic with two dual-angle shower heads. Use either or both. * SERVICE - As noted, the hotel's chic design is all very manufactured. But, the HRSD is NOT just a mediocre hotel dressed up with a 'gimmick' . . . I still found this to be a highly effective business class hotel with excellent service, friendly staff, and a great business center. And, you won't feel 'price gouged' here either. They offer free internet access in-room and in the business center - this really saved me with that conference call I had to take part in. BAD (room for improvement) * ACCESS - The check in / out times of 4 pm / 11 am seem a tad restrictive to a HRSD guest who may be just trying to enjoy a few days of leisure. In most cases where I encounter late check-in times, I have been able to check in early but that was not the case at the HRSD - and it looked like they were far from booked in-full. The front desk person(s) did offer to call me via cell when they had a room ready so this may have been an isolated incident. * LIGHTING - While the room's illumination options are multiple - and very cool - even with all going to once you may find the room poorly lit at night. They do offer a cool bed backboard flexible snake light for late reading. UGLY * Based on the great location at the foot of the gaslamp district you may hear some drunken revelry and the occasional crackling police p.a. in the small hours. Of course, if you're one of those drunken revelers this shouldn't bother you. BOTTOM LINE * You will not regret your decision to stay at the HRSD - the overwhelmingly positive reviews here in a negative world speak volumes. * As a guitar player, I love to see all of those artist-signed and used axes. That and the hotel stylings make the HRSD a nice departure from the hotel norm. * The most important hotel review question is this - \"in a similar circumstance, would I stay there again?\" - that is an easy 'yes' for me.

I went to the hotel at 1:30 (even though check in was at 4) and asked if the room was ready. They told me that it was and when I was asked if I wanted to upgrade our studio room to a suite, I explained it was my husbands birthday and wasnt sure if I could manage the extra expense. They told me that they wanted our weekend to be great, so the upgrade would be a birthday present from them! AWESOME!

We ate lunch and breakfast the next morning at Mary Janes Diner and both of us enjoyed both meals and are looking forward to going back in the future. We did go to the pool, and there was only room for two on a long couch with no room by the pool or the jacuzzi. The DJ was playing great music and everyone was having a great time. We waited quite a while for someone to come over, but no one ever did. After about 15-20 minutes, we left. Later that evening as we were talking to friends, we were told that it was the last weeekend of \"Intervention\", and understood that was why it was so crowded.

She was very helpful and was able to get us a room on the top (12th) floor facing the bay. I thought this would be perfect since I read a lot of complaints about noise and figured on the top floor it shouldn\u2019t be as bad. I was wrong, the music could be heard until after 2:00am, and then the noisy drunks were running up and down our hall yelling and being loud until after 2:30am. The noisy drunks, I cannot blame on the hotel, because you will find those at any \u201cparty\u201d hotel. I just wish that I would have realized what a party hotel this was before we booked our vacation here. Other then the noise and lack of sleep, this is a very nice hotel. The lobby was clean and open, it felt very welcoming. Our room was very clean and quite spacious. The bathroom was quite large and had a lovely rain shower, however, you must note that the products in our bathroom were not Aveda, that I could tell, they were their Spa brand, again not a complaint, just a note. The hotel is in a great location. We were able to walk up and down the streets in the Gas Lamp district to find shops and restaurants. We also walked to Sea Port Village, about a mile walk, not bad at all. It's also a nice little walk over to the Convention Center and from there you can get to the marina to take the ferry over to Coronado. So, the location really is ideal! I really did enjoy this hotel, but I do not plan on staying here again because when we go on vacation, we want to be on our own time table, not on the hotel\u2019s, meaning, if we want to go to bed at 11pm, then we should be able to, but you cannot do that here, too much bass from their clubs prevent that from happening. I would recommend this hotel to my friend\u2019s who like to party all night, but I would not recommend this hotel to my friend\u2019s who have young children and/or do not like to party all night.

I was aware of the charges pertaining to in room items for purchase but we didnt use and were not charged for them. The room was an okay size as we dont spend much time in room when traveling.

When the pool is not available (usually on Sunday night) you can use the pool across the street at the Omni. TV, Internet and A/C worked well. The location is excellent with everything within walking distance. The zoo, Sea World, beaches and airport are just a few minutes drive away. Had no problem with valet as others have posted. It was $35 a night to park car but this is in line with other hotels in area. There is public parking garage that is close but still would have cost $20 a day to park there. All interaction with staff was pleasant. I would recommend this hotel to all. Only advise I would give is to try and get room on upper floor as on the weekend the bar rocks and I am sure you can hear it on the lower floors. We were on 11th floor so it was no problem for us.

The place is Uber-Chic and totally styled like you would expect a Hard Rock hotel to be. But wait... I am getting a bit ahead of myself. First of all, I would like to mention the way the reservation was handled. It was professional and they even asked what type of music I wanted playing in my room when I arrived (which it was). Between making my reservation and actually staying at the hotel, I received several emails (albeit automatically generated) reminding me of my stay and options to book a spa visit, question what is going on in the area, etc. I have never had this kind of attention from a hotel, and I for one... liked it. Okay, so I arrive and the line to get valet parking was kind of busy, so I parked across the street in the public parking and save myself some money ($21 per day vs. $35 per day at the hotel... although no in/out priveleges). When I arrived, my room was ready and clean. When I checked out the room, it was very stylish. There was a HUGE screen TV and some interesting architectural items like a small little \"Peek-a-boo\" window behind the mini-bar that looked straight into the bathroom... specifically in to the shower. Given that this was a single King bed room, I would imagine that they figured out that either one person was staying here or, at least, two people who knew each other quite well and would not mind watching each other shower. Again... totally cool... and totally Hard Rock. Just a couple other things about the room. First of all, no tub. Shower only [albeit with a terrific \"rain\" shower head]. Apparently rock stars don't like to soak. AND... the room, although totally \"techy\" has no DVD player. Disappointing. I brought Netflix DVDs with me to watch and when I couldn't find a DVD player in the room I called the front desk (\"chic-ly\" called \"Ground Control\" at the hotel) and asked about a DVD player. Yes, they have them, but at a cost of $100 per night! Too pricey for me. Now I am not the usual Hard Rock \"demographic\" as I am close to 50 years of age, but the Hard Rock staff made me feel comfortable nonetheless. The hotel is about a block away from Petco Park so if you are going to catch a Padres game, the location is PERFECT. The only complaint I had, and it is not the Hard Rock's issue, was that the people across from my room were very, very noisey and loud... usually until 2 or 3 in the morning. They were apparently there for a Bachelor/Bachelorette party and well, it was the Hard Rock so they were partying like... well, rock stars! It made getting to sleep and staying asleep a little challenging, but I made it through. Which brings me to my final point. If you go, and you really should, request a room on a higher floor. There is the 207 Lounge on the first floor and they party there quite late into the evening/early morning. I heard them quite a bit and I was on the 8th floor, so I can only imagine that it would be pretty much unbearable on a lower floor. But in any case, the Hard Rock lived up to its expectations as a cool, hip, trendy location. The staff appears to be well trained and the rooms well designed. Overall a good experience and one I would imagine others would enjoy.", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNot so Rock'n\u201d", "Author": "Leigh6", "ReviewID": "UR71351503", "Content": "Was very disappointed with our recent stay at the HR.

He was super nice, I ran into him a few more times during our stay and he would always greet us and ask how things were going. We were in a suite. A pretty awesome sweet. I believe it was called the Black Eyed Peas Suite. It ran about 330.00 a night. I am very glad that my wife's company was picking up the bill. I loved the shower with the two spray heads. One normal and the other coming down from the ceiling. The decorations were pretty awesome. Loved the contemporary feel. We slept very well in the beds and found the reading lamps very cool and useful. We had a view facing downtown and the Gaslamp area. It was cool to look out at night and see everything going on. Everything is so lit up. If I looked over the balcony and too the left I could see an aircraft carrier in the harbor. If I looked to the right, I could see part of Petco field. There were games going on two of the nights we were there. It got loud when they scored. Not too loud. We kept the balcony doors open most of the time we were in the room except for when we were sleeping. When the doors were closed, we really didn't hear much except for an ocassional siren or horn. After a couple of days, I tried to get a pool view suite but since there was a huge conference in town, there were no rooms available. Got to check out the pool area a few times. Never swam. We hung out for a bit and did some people watching. There were several parties going on during our stay. If you want to party like a rockstar then this is the place to be. Seen a few celebrities in and around the hotel. It was pretty awesome. Didn't check out any of the restaurants in the hotel but they do have a yogurt place connected that was fabulous.

It was on the roof-top near the pool so we could savor that cool breeze. The rooms are spacious although I have to admit they have strange chairs and the stools at the in-room bar were not comfortable (I was using my computer on the bar). The WiFi is $15 a day, which is a little pricey in my book. But the location is superb - right across from the San Diego Convention Center and in the Gaslamp Quarter with lots of restaurants and clubs. We had breakfast at the Hard Rock's coffee shop and it was good. And we came in one night to find the lobby booming music and people lined up outside to get in - obviously a preferred place to be. But, upstair, it was quiet. One thing I liked is that you had to have a card key to use the elevator, which kept people from roaming the halls. There were no doors slamming or people yelling in the halls. The service was unbelievable - it's a great place to stay.", "Date": "May 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWere these my friends or employees???\u201d", "Author": "JerseyShoreGirlsrock", "ReviewID": "UR63244750", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Hard Rock for a week of fun!

The rooms were very comfortable and well set up. Super comfortable beds, big flat panel tv, and little touches like Rolling Stone magazines and Aveda bath products really set this apart from other places. After coming back from sightseeing each day we stopped for Pink Berry frozen yogurt and then hung out at the 4th floor pool and bar area. What a great way to unwind before getting ready to go out. The hotel is right in the Gaslamp Quarter and within walking distance of the seaport tourist area. There are a ton of restaurants, bars and shops right down the street. We enjoyed some great dinners and had a lot of fun going out. Our only issues were outside noise. Passing trains woke us up but I'm sure it would be the same if we stayed at any of the other places in the area. The nightclub was also very loud. We liked the music, just not while trying to sleep. The hotel staff provided outstanding customer service and moved us farther away from the noise the next day. Everyone who helped us was great, even the valets!

Check. Ridiculously big \"studio\" room? Check. MaryJane's perfect chocolate malt shake at 1 am? Check. Relaxed hubby? Priceless. We visited Hard Rock San Diego on April 9, 2010. The purpose of the trip was to thank my husband for being such a rock star through my cancer and IVF treatments, and to get in a tiny staycation before my hysterectomy on Monday. (I'm 34, story of it all here: www.casadefrias.com). In short, it's a perfect place for a one-night stand. VALET Upon arrival, the very professional, friendly valet staff made us feel welcome right away. They even got some waiting cabs to go around the block so we could move into the valet lane and get out of traffic quickly. Some people may say it's a tad pricey, but as a local I can say it's in line with what most places charge downtown. When CHECK-IN We were second in line, and checked in within 5 minutes. Props to Christian for his kindness and efficiency in getting us a great room on a high floor with a killer view of the bay. ROOM This is where it gets ridiculous. We booked Hard Rock's smallest room, which they dub a \"Studio Room.\" Now I've traveled a lot (both in the States and international), and I know what a studio room looks like: 6-18 inches between the sides of the bed and wall, a bathroom you can barely turn around in. This hardly fit that bill. The room was overly spacious for 2 adults. They don't overstuff the room with unnecessary furniture. The bar and fridge are smartly tucked in the corner. The large shower easily holds 2 people (and there's no pesky tub to climb over). The bathroom is roomy enough that we were both able to get ready at the same time. DINING While we didn't eat at the sushi place (we couldn't, they were booked solid with reservations for the night), we did eat at Mary Janes, the throwback diner, twice. The first time was just a shake with fries/rings combo (get the dipping sauce, it's divine). The next morning we went for breakfast, and the Tijuana Benedict (pork) was inventive and delicious. Overheard at Mary Janes restaurant during breakfast: Dad, \"You really want berries on that?\" to which the child replied, \"Oh, what do I know, I'm 6.\" FINAL THOUGHTS From the moment you walk into the spacious, airy lobby, to when you leave, Hard Rock San Diego is a rock star experience.", "Date": "April 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cThese tips could really enhance your stay\u201d", "Author": "LBelle511", "ReviewID": "UR62282805", "Content": "My friend and I arrived on Tues evening and were booked for 2 nites. The front desk girl who checked us in asked us if we wanted a room with a balcony? Since I have never stayed there, I said yes. MISTAKE. It was a mistake due to the weather conditions for San Diego were cold, rainy, and windy for the days we were staying and there was really no need for the balcony whatsoever, as there was no one at pool or any reason anyone would even need the balcony with the upcoming weather conditions. When we arrived in our room 12th floor (their highest level) we had rm 1259. It is a corner room with very little space at all. The bathrm was very tiny and had no ventilation or fan whatsoever, and the door from the bathrom into the bedroom was located less than a ft. from the bedside. There was only a shower, so if you are in the mood for a bath , or have a lady with you, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS RM,,or you will be going downstairs to change it. The lighting was florescent and with the red walls, it wasnt the place for a girl to do her makeup at all. Thankfully there was a mirror located by the minibar in the front room, very awkward, but it saved me. The entire room may have been 600 sq ft.,that is with a queen size bed and 2 very uncomfortable sofas that looked more like fancy leather futons. The floor to cieling curtains looked great, but the electronic curtain/drape openers werent working...not one of them, so we didnt really fight at the blinds to see our great view and THE BALCONY<O JOY! I had an 80minute massage at their spa. The spa was very quiet and clean and pretty basic with not alot of frills, but nice just the same. The massage I would give a thumbs up. The ISSUE I had was the spa is located on the 3rd floor (which is on the same floor as other rooms are) and when I got off of the elevator, I could see no sign as to where on the floor the spa was, so I went searching. On 2 seperate occassions, we went into the 207club. The waitstaff is superfriendly and attentive. Our 2nd trip in , it was late afternoon and it was absolutely freeeZING and windy out.. IN SPITE of the frigid temperatures that were clearly cooling down the entire place, they left the door open. We were there for over an hr and could nt believe no one closed it..it was absurd and was certainly freezing up their waitstaff, as we were chilly ourselves even while wearing long sleeved coats. Just had to write these few things in hopes of letting everyone know these little quirks I encountered.

We stayed at the hotel at the end of November and although it was quite busy, the staff always took the time to make sure we were ok and offer assistance. As it was a special occasion, the room we booked was a Hard Rock Suite and it was massive. It had separate lounge, bedroom, bathroom and balcony. For the price it was fantastic. We treated ourselves to a dinner at Nobu to celebrate and it didnt disappoint. We were worried we wouldn't be able to get in at the last minute, but the hotel staff made all the arrangements for us - no problems . Maryjanes was, as mentioned on the blog we used, great for breakfast and the happy hour was well worth a visit - stuffed ourselves silly and had lots of yummy cocktails. We can see that 'in the season' or if a large event is on, the hotel could possibly get a bit swamped, but it is huge and with the large amount of staff and facilities so I'm sure they could cope, no problems. Its a very quick drive to Sea World and the Zoo, and with our car parked in the multi-storey across the street - thanks again http://casualconnoisseur.blogspot.com/ for the tip !, they also advised of the free wifi, which we used quite a bit.

I checked in around 10pm on a Sunday night and was checked in at a little podium (the hotel bucks the trend and doesn't have a traditional front desk). The guy checking me in looked like an underwear model; they definitely hire staff who fit the concept. The underwear model and I had to raise our voices as we exchanged information because the check-in area is adjacent to one of San Diego's hottest night clubs, which was in full swing and located off the hotel lobby. If I was here with friends, or for a bachelor party, or looking to whoop it up this would have been the place for me. Because I was in town for a conference and I had to have my corporate face on I felt out of place. My favorite touch was the flat screen TV. Hard Rock has several commercial-free radio stations playing and the ability to plug my iPod into it was great when working on my laptop (they supplied all the hook up wires). Pool was beautiful.

I believe it is a newer hotel. The d\u00e9cor is like you would expect for a Hard Rock; modern and sleek. The layout of the room was nice. I will point out a few of the issues I had while staying there. First, I was only on the 5th floor facing the convention center. I know my entire company was at the hotel so I know it was full. The issue being on the 5th floor is the club noise from the bar in the hotel named 207. Every night there are a ton of people at this bar and they can not smoke indoors. Hence, they stand on the sidewalk right out side my window. Additionally, there is a train that goes by about every hour. After one night I went and got ear plugs and the noise was no longer an issue. Most of my company meetings were on the 2nd or 4th floor. However, I could not find a stair well to take me down just one flight of stairs. They all appear to be fire stairwells. The first day before I knew this I had to walk all the way down to the ground floor and then ride the elevator back to the 4th floor. No big deal but a bit annoying to be forced to use the elevator. What distributed me more was all the clutter on the 2nd and 1st floor in the stair well. If they are truly fire stairs they should be clear. Overall the room was clean but the bathroom needed to be scrubbed a bit more. There was stray hair in the shower and water rings on the counter. Again not a huge deal but it does make you wonder why they are cutting corners. I also know for some people stray hair in the shower is a big deal so I thought I would mention it. For those of you planning a meeting here, hire an outside vendor. Do not use the in house crew. The general sessions we had were terrible. They were 1-10 getting the mics working on the first try. It actually became a joke with the presenters. I go to a ton of these things a year and this was the worst production I had seen in a very long time. Additionally, they were 0-3 getting video to work successfully the first time. Overall, it took away from the presentations. The things I liked. The bed was extremely comfortable and the sheets were the white 500 thread count. I also enjoyed the towels after the first day. They were thick and comfortable as well. It appears the first day I was given older non branded towel. Again, I know how booked the hotel was for the conference. The second day I had newer branded towels and they were wonderful. The shower has a rain shower head and a normal one. A bit of a luxury. I would also complement the catering staff. All the food in the breaks outs were delicious and healthy. The food that was served during lunch was good as well. One day we had a sit down family style lunch and the next a buffet. Breakfast was always a buffet and always stocked. For those not traveling on your company\u2019s dime be aware that WiFi is $15 a day. Additionally, the only parking at the hotel is valet at $25 a day. I did hear some peers parked down the street on their own at $15 a day. Overall I am glad I got to experience the Hard Rock. However, if I was going to travel to San Diego on my own dime I would stay somewhere else. I will never suggest having another conference in this hotel.", "Date": "February 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cBeyond Expectations!!\u201d", "Author": "NewDawnFades", "ReviewID": "UR54183185", "Content": "I hosted a number of clients on business at the Hard Rock.

Some places were open and were able to have a wonderful dinner and drinks. The next day, we planned on attending the Charger's Block Party that was only a block from the Hard Rock. The energy was building as fans started to arrive... The Hard Rock was becoming ground zero! We discovered some problems with our room's sound system and called the front desk. Two sound technicians were at our door in minutes and quickly found the loose cords! They were also Charger fans attending the block party later that night. My girlfriend and I stayed in a \"Rock Star\" suite and our friends in a \"Regular\" room. Both rooms were awesome with all toys for an adult's night out. We did see some families with children out for the holiday weekend, but we all agreed this property caters mainly to adults. Drinks at the two bars are a bit pricey...$10.00 for a cocktail??? No thanks we \"Brown bagged ours\". The Charger's Block Party was a blast, and later it seemed that everyone ended up by the pool at Float to continue into the night. All guests of the hotel can get on the VIP list to both clubs at the hotel. That will save you the $20.00 cover they try to charge... you'll need it for the drinks! That's downtown I guess.

I also had the chance to use the gym, and it had just enough equipment to fulfill my workout routine, also the bars at the hotel (207 and Float) were equally as cool and inspiring. In fact, after Saturday's night game, half of the Giants team came into 207 for drinks. The only downer, and yes, no hotel is perfect - was the check in process, only one person was working the desk, and the line was about five deep. Thought they could have brought someone out then.

Staff: Very friendly and professional staff. They are consistently trained to provide a high level of service, although you do notice that many of them, if they are not providing service, have their heads down looking at their phones as they furiously text message their friends. If they looked up more, they might see more service opportunities. However, still, very good service. Facilities: The design is very interesting and engaging. Great use of videos, lighting and neat furniture. Of course, the memorabilia everywhere is great and you\u2019d often see people stopping to look at displays on the wall. The bed was comfortable and I loved the shower! Only issue with the bed is that they are on platforms that stick out, and although the corners of the platforms are padded, I bumped into or tripped over the corners all the time. The pool area and party deck on the 4th floor are really neat. The gym is a decent size. I didn\u2019t use the spa but it looked nice. Highlights: The location of this place is great. Right across from the convention center, a 10-15 minute stroll down the marina promenade to Seaport Village, a block from Petco Park and right at the entrance to the Gaslamp Quarter. Derrick, the guy who checked me in, was terrific and the housekeeping staff did a good job of cleaning up after me and the party animals who ran amok. Areas for improvement: The signage in the hallways is very hard to read. The lighting is dim and the signs are very small in dark metal tones set against brown walls. My eyesight is pretty good, but I still had to get up close to read which way to the gym or verify the room number. I also had two different young people ask me which way to go in the hallway because they couldn\u2019t see the signs. More direction at the front desk would be helpful when there is a crowd because it\u2019s not always clear which of the little pods that serve as the front desk is open. The biggest concern I had was the noise level late at night. After the bars closed on two nights, it sounded like the party moved into the hallway right outside my room. That was confirmed the next morning when I saw a lot of feathers and other detritus outside in the hallway. There\u2019s not much you can do when 10-15 drunken youngsters are yelling, singing, smoking and carousing in the hallway. It didn\u2019t last long so they would have been gone by the time security came up to investigate but there were numerous groups of them coming in over the course of a few hours and the combined effect added up to about 2 hours of lost sleep. Overall impression: The Hard Rock has a great setup and a true focus on the customer experience. The facilities are nice and the staff is very professional. If you like a place that is very much a \u201cscene\u201d, you will not be disappointed. If you\u2019re staying here on the weekend and you go to sleep before 3:00 am, you may think you\u2019re in the wrong place. I\u2019m in my early 40\u2019s, and looking at the people who were walking around the hotel in bikinis and swim trunks who were young enough to be my children, I just don\u2019t think I\u2019m the target demographic. I like to sleep at night and this isn't the place to do that. Nearby transportation: There is a trolley stop right outside the hotel that can connect you with downtown, old town or even Tijuana! Additionally, the city bus (#992) stops at 4th Avenue and Broadway, just a 10 minute walk from the hotel. That ride takes less than 20 minutes and is only $2.25. There is also a luggage rack on the bus.

They quickly got me setup with my room at 11:00 AM. Beyond that, they were very courteous to me. The room was awesome. Bed was incredibly comfy. Minibar, stocked fridge and snacks, any alcohol you could ask for. Great view of the poolside from my POV. Chair was interesting looking, but more decorative than practical. Shower was big with glass windows, and rained down on you versus your typical shower head. Breakfast was delicious. Only downside was although they had an HDTV, there wasn't any HD programming. I kind of expected more from that, but they also had a ton of connections to hook up your computer, iPod, or gaming system, which was a nice addition. Hotel's location was also a big plus. Right across the street from the convention center, minutes from beaches and the bridge to Coronado. At night when I returned, my bed was lit very elegantly with LED lights, the rest of the room darkened. Flick of a light switch highlighted just the right spots in the room. If only I had a date!

The weekend can simply be summarized as, well....fantastic! I normally don't give reviews 5's across the board, but this place deserved it. Check-In - fast, courteous, and very friendly check-in. Derek did an awesome job at making us feel welcome from the moment we reached the property, and remembered us even the next day. Great customer service! Rooms - we had two studio rooms. One overlooking the pool and the other overlooking the Padres's stadium. 10th floor was nice and our room had a small patio on it with two chairs and a table...great place to hang out while getting ready for the evening and watching the action at the pool. Clean, contemporary, straight lines and soothing color scheme. Great shower and Aveda products to boot. 50\" Hi-Def TV with about a dozen music channels to listen to. Room service is complete around 3-4 PM. On-premise food / beverages - MaryJane's is a diner on the first floor. Great food at reasonable prices. They have an awesome happy hour with drinks about 1/2 price as compared to the other bars on-premise. I also ate some appetizers at Float / pool...the humus and pita chips was the bomb! At $9 I was a bit nervous, but there was enough for 2-3 people and was very fresh...the pita chips were served warm and just grilled. Drink prices at the pool / Float during the day were what I expected...about $5-7 for a beer. Mixed drinks were more. Specialty drinks at ~$14. Bars - Multiple, awesome choices. As a hotel guest, call down to the concierge before 8 PM to get on the lists for both Float and 207, then show up to the bars before 10 PM and have your hand stamped for access to either all night without having to wait in line; and let me tell you, the lines are long! So utilize this comp. Float is a chic outdoor patio club/lounge on the 4th floor adjacent to the pool and they tend to play techno / house music at night. On the first floor off of the lobby is 207, its a dimly lit, deep woody vibe to it and they play hip-hop. You can get bottle service at either...entry bottle at ~$325. Float stays open and plays music until ~1:30 AM, so if your room faces the pool, just realize that its hard to fall alsleep early, but that said, if you want to go to bed early, then this probably isn't the place for you anyways. In general we spent more time at Float, as we liked the outdoor vibe a bit better, but they are both great and both are open during the day on the weekend for the sports enthusiast who needs a place to watch a few games. I also want to give a huge \"job well done\" to a few of the Float staff members who made the trip and visit worth while - Erica, Danielle, and Natalie! Thanks to the three of you for being so nice and providing some of the best pool / bar servicing that I've seen in all of my travels around the world. Hard Rock staff, you have some great employees! Location - simply perfect. The HRH is located at the cap end of the Gaslamp Quarter right in front of the convention center. Nobu is connected and there are multiple restaurants to try in the area. Venture out and sample a few things outside of the hotel...it will only make you appreciate even more how great the HRH can be with the right, open, and carefree attitude. $17 facility charge - yes there is a $17 resort charge, but it covers your internet / wireless connections and fitness center. Not a big deal, and honestly, I didn't mide it at all. The fitness center had great, new equipment and I even got in 2 great workouts during my stay.

We tried both TV's and neither one of them worked. I kept hearing about people hitting there ankles on the bed corners and I'l be damned, I did it three times. What also pissed me off was that they charged me 17 bucks to use their facilities, which is horrible. I was there to relax and not work out. They shouldn't be charging you unless you use them. The one thing that really ticked me off was, we decided to go to the pool to relax and have a drink around 9:30 and were not allowed in because we didn't have club attire. I told him we were guests, but he said that doesn't matter. Either you change or you don't get in. So, what is the 17 dollar charge for again? I can't even get into the pool. I didn't even bother wih the downstairs bar. They would have denied me there too. I understand that San Diego/Hard Rock brings in a younger crowd, but to put the party goers first, before their guests who want to be leisure, is absolutely wrong. We had to walk down the street to have a drink and when we got back, I must of had about 5 peope fall on me because they were drunk. I am in my 30's, so I know how to have fun, but when I fork out hundreds of my hard earned dollars to stay somewhere, I should be able to go where I want within the hotel, without being told I am not dressed for the occasion.

Our room was spectacular! Two large flat screen TV's were playing our music of choice, the decor was ultra modern and the room was super spacious. We had a King Suite with a fabulous rainfall shower and an very comfy bed. The pool and its bar were also great! The lobby bar and the diner in the lobby area were also jammin'! We of course did the tourist thing with sea world and the san diego zoo. I recommend both if you are visiting the area! We had a great time walking down the gas lamp district and exploring our large choices for dining and cocktails. We also did a hornblower dinner dancing cruise in the bay. It was great! The food was good, service was good and it was a relaxing way to see the bay, Coronado Island and the bridge at sunset. The parking is minimal on the street but I would recommend vallet parking with the hotel for $32/day with in & out privileges. It made our trip much less stressful and the vallet staff were excellent and helpful with directions. Overall, our experience at the Hard Rock was amazing! It was even better than I had hoped it would be starting with the location, its decor, service, and fun atmosphere! I would recommend this for couples and friends.

Especially like the little reading lamp on each side of the headboard - very effectively focused light. It was great to be able to just walk out any night and be in the Gaslamp Quarter for our evening's entertainment. And whenever we drove, the valets put 2 bottles of water in our car and offered directions to wherever we wanted to go. The staff got stressed out during busy times like their summer pool party, but even then remained very accomodating and professional - while waiting for our room they allowed us to freshen up in the spa, and catered to many other requests. Their pool bar area is really well done - breezy and well appointed with couches / lamps / stools. The bartenders are friendly and know their cocktails. I live in Geneva, Switzerland and the fancy rooftop bars here pale in comparison.

No one at the front desk told us this and we used our debit card to pay, so the next day, I noticed $2700 was taken out of our account from Hard Rock. I called the front desk and they were very nice about it and explained that they immediately put a hold on the entire amount of your stay plus $250 per night for incidentals and then at the end of the stay, they actually only charge you for what you charged to your room. We were fine with it, but i couldn't help but think about people who used their debit card not knowing how much would be charged to it and then been totally screwed if Hard Rock was holding $2700 of their cash until the end of their trip when their room stay would only have cost them $1200. Anyway, so the point is to use a credit card if you don't want your cash tied up.

I am not an overly finicky traveler, but once I got there, I regretted every minute of it. First of all, it was past 5pm and they said my room was not ready yet. I can forgive that. But then, when I finally got my room cards at 6:30pm, I found some unsavory characters loitering in the hallways near my room and entered my room to find an unmade bed, large stains on the carpet, and a bathroom that smelled heavily of mold. Bad. Other than the layout, the condition of the room looks nothing like you see in the online photos. I ordered room service and it took almost TWO HOURS to arrive! All the while, my \"high speed\" internet connection kept timing out for some unknown reason (you pay a \"resort fee\" of $15 per day, which is supposed to include HSIA). Very frustrating since I had some legitimate work to do that evening. But it gets worse. Next morning, no hot or even warm water in the shower (at 6:45am...can't possibly be out of hot water yet). The maid had forgotten to leave soap, shampoo, etc. the prior day, so I had to go without. Came back from golf at 4:30pm, bed was still unmade, and no new supplies. I called down to the front desk and no one seemed to care, and no maid ever showed up. Then, around 7pm, another guest entered my room! Turns out, they had double booked it. I came back from dinner around 10:30pm (on a Tuesday night) only to hear blaring music from down below (and I was on the 6th floor, not the 2nd or 3rd). It went on until after 2am and when I looked out my window, I could still see a rather seedy crowd hanging around outside the hotel. The next morning, I went to check out and they handed me someone else's bill (from a different room) using my name! Total confusion at the front desk. Whatever you do, avoid this hotel.

The hotel's location can't be beat for fun in the Gaslamp District as you can pretty much walk wherever you need to go or hop on the trolley. There is no hotel parking. You either valet for $20 per day (no ins & outs) or you park in the structure across the street from both the Omni and Hard Rock for about $12 per day (no ins & outs.) We decided to park in the structure for our stay and take a cab when we wanted to go to the San Diego Zoo (about an $8 cab ride each way - so we saved on parking @ the Zoo and @ the Hotel.) The structure is close enough for you to carry your own bags into the hotel - no biggie. The hotel is small overall so you're not going to get lost and you'll quickly find your way around the entire place. The suite was much smaller than I would have expected. I can't imagine what a regular room would be like, but I was surprised how small the suite was. Everything was decorated in what I like to call Ikea-chic... not very comfortable, but it looked cool. The bed was excellent, loved the fluffy pillows and fantastic down comforter. The shower and toilet room offer little in the way of privacy - so I absolutely do not recommend this hotel for groups of people who might be uncomfortable with showing off your naked silhouette while showering or who need more than a frosted door to feel comfortable using the toilet with others around. Any and every noise can be heard with clarity. There's no lock or knob on any of the bathroom doors - nothing but you and a frosted pane of glass. I love my husband, but there are times when we all need a little bit of privacy, right? I liked the way the music was set up when you walked into the room, the TVs were nice and every single member of the staff we encountered was very helpful and very polite. The gym facilities are great and we used them each day of our stay. We also had a fun view of the baseball park and could hear the game from our room if we opened our window. A few stories higher (we were on the 8th) and I'm sure we could have even seen some of the game. The atmosphere of the place is a 24/7 nightclub - during the day people walk around the hotel in bikinis, swim trunks and sunglasses. At night, skimpy skirts and sleazy club attire. Every time we got in the elevator it reeked of cologne, booze and cigarettes. We're still in our mid-20's but this was just not our scene (on the bright side - we were able to get away from it and hit up Dizzy's Jazz club at the San Diego Wine & Culinary Center which was about a 2 minute walk from the Hard Rock at the Harbor Club Towers.)

This hotel is trendy, definitely filled with some people who try too hard and just want to see and be seen, but its what makes the Hard Rock the Hard Rock and we found it to be entertaining. There are two bars at this property, both of which are very popular. We had drinks one night at the Moonstone Lounge. Fun place and good people watching. The line to get in the place on Sat. night was ridiculously long though, I so I would recommend going any night but Saturday unless you get there early (I do think you can get on a list if you are staying at the property). We stayed in a King Deluxe Suite on the 7th floor and the room was large and very spacious. Full living room with a bar, 2 flat screens, small balcony, etc. We never had problems with noise as other people indicated, but the bars are on the first and fourth floors and we faced away from the pool area so we didnt have a problem. A few cons to note. Housekeeping was a little spotty. One day they didn't leave us any hand towels, we ran out of body wash and shampoo on day 2 - both of which were never replaced during our entire stay, our full length mirror was never cleaned (I had accidentally gotten some hair product on it so I know), and the open bathroom situation is a bit strange (or should I say the room in which the toilet lives). There is a glass door that swings open but it is open at the top and the bottom and really offers no privacy. The biggest issue we had was with the mini-bar and random charges on our bill. The first day we had a receipt left on our dresser for a $4 water that we didn't drink. No big deal, they took it right off the bill. Our last night there we realized we had a $155 mini-bar charge on our account (no receipt left -- just noticed by looking up our account on the TV) and we hadn't touched the mini-bar the entire time we were there. We wanted to address it that night as we had an early flight the next day, but were told they needed to speak to the housekeeping manager first who wouldn't be in until the next morning. Checked out the next morning, charge had been taken off the bill. Check our AMEX bill the next day and they had charged us the $155 without authorization.

I'm glad I did as a room near the pool bar area would have been very noisy, still there was an in-room party nearby going on until 6 am but this did not keep us awake. I was also aware of the turn down fee and the valet charges both of which I didn't feel were out of line. The queen suite was large, always clean and we also received our bottled water and hard rock candy early each evening provided with the turn down service. I didn't make use of any of the on site restaurants, bars or pool area. I considered going to the pool one day, walked in mid afternoon on the Sunday to check it but the area around the bar and pool was very busy so didn't stay. Although there wasn't anybody in the actual pool it did look like a great place to hang out. The staff always treated us great, the reminder and post stay follow up emails showed that they are at least looking for feedback and judging by some earlier posts I believe they are making amends.

It's hard to separate the Hard Rock Hotel in San Diego from the neighborhood it is in: Gaslamp. The hotel basically anchors the entrance to the Gaslamp District (comprised of hotels, restaurants, bars and shops too numerous to mention) and reflects the general atmosphere. On the weekends, HRH is a party place - period. It is loud, crowded and energentic. During the week, it is laidback and has a lot of contemporary charm. My wife and I used the weekends to let loose and the weekdays to move about the city for some sightseeing; it worked perfectly at the HRH. Being a registered guest at the hotel gets you on a pseudo-VIP list to the hotel's clubs on Friday/Saturday and to the Sunday Invervention pool party on Sunday afternoon. These events are very pretentious but fun (probably more so with a group of friends). For sightseeing, the location at the \"foot\" of the Gaslamp District is perfect. Not only is Petco Park right next door, 2 very user-friendly city MTS trolleys are within walking distance. Knowing what I know now, I could easily get to every major sightseeing destination in San Diego using the trolley system and the 2 major sightseeing transportation companies (one is a trolley/other is a double-decker bus) without a car. As for general hotel service/amenities, HRH follows the general trend I felt in the city itself: a) service is average and nobody really puts forth much extra effort and b) prices are on the expensive side. We did appreciate our housekeeping crew - their customer service was the best of any we received in San Diego (including all restaurants, bars, tours, etc...). The room itself was a bit odd though. We had a King Suite (with a great balcony). However, the layout of the room is not very practical and the fact that the bathroom had sort of an \"open air\" concept will be off-putting to some. Finally, valet parking in too high at $30 per day but seems to be competitive with the area. I would definitely stay at HRH again and would suggest it to friends. However, it is not for everyone. The place is, again, full of energy (i.e. noisy, young crowd) and not concerned about making you feel at home (on purpose, I would assume) as some hotels do. I think if people understand what the place is about before going, the experience will be a positive one.", "Date": "July 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cHard Rock Hotel - Excelelnt Hotel - With some down sides\u201d", "Author": "Woody_000", "ReviewID": "UR17849298", "Content": "We stayed in the hard Rock for 2 nights after is was at a conference at another hotel for the week.

We arrived at the front of the hotel and the lobby was very modern looking and clean. Staffing was good and we were helped right away. We were given our room keys and up we went. As soon as the elevator doors opened, it was as if we had stepped into another hotel. The hallway was filthy. There was trash and dirt all over the carpet in the hallway. Perhaps the dark color of the carpeting showed off the dirt, but a good vacuuming was in order. When we entered the room, it appeared to be clean, at least cleaner than the hallway. Very modern looking. It took about 2 minutes for my shin to find the wood base of the bed that sticks out farther than the mattress on all sides. It wasn't the last bruise I got from the bed that weekend! We did like the bathroom decor. We thought the shower with two shower heads was great! I went to pull out the desk chair to sit down and there was a stain in the middle of the seat that looked disgusting. A call was placed to the desk to get housekeeping up to clean it. Some time during the evening, the chair was cleaned. A message was left on the phone and tv that the cleaning had been done. Sunday morning, the hallways were still dirty, in fact more trash was added to the floor. We left for a day of sailing and returned at 4:30 in the afternoon to a dirty room. They had not even made the bed, let alone do any other cleaning or straightening of the room. Another call had to be made to get the room clean. I also asked to speak with the manager. I thought I would tell him about the dirty hallway. Of course, right after I ask for the manager, I hear a vacuum in the hallway! That was short lived, only about 2 minutes of hallway vacuuming, so it was still dirty. I think maybe someone else complained so they vacuumed in front of one or two doors (we were not one of the chosen few). The manager never called. We eventually went out for the evening. The room had been cleaned by the time we returned. Sunday, check out time. Still filthy hallway on our floor. Maybe we should have checked out the other floors? I am not a neat freak but the floor was so obviously dirty it really was a disappointment, especially for the cost of staying here. Normally I hear Hard Rock and think of good things. The San Diego Hard Rock was truly a disappointment. After checking out we did inform the manager of all the problems. He just said they were short staffed in housekeeping. I'm sorry but for what they charge to stay their, and to keep their reputation, the manager should get to cleaning if need be.

There is music all around the hotel which is cool. My major complaint about the Hard Rock is the bars and the cost. The bars are trying to be \"exclusive\" by limiting people and creating fake lines to get in. If you are a hotel guest you can get on the list, but have to be in the bars by 10pm.

One lady was an owner of one of the units and was not let into the pool. She got the manager and was finally let in. The drinks are really expensive at $10 a piece, which is way above other area bars. A friend of our tried to get in but the doorman said he could not go to the bar unless he was willing to do table service, which costs at least $300. We were in the bar and there was no table service going on at that time. The people in the bars are wantabe posers, and like to act like they have money.

The minute we turned the TV on, the music was gone for good not to return because we couldn't figure out how to get it back. It should be noted that if you are not the most technically inclined of people the rooms multimedia gadgets are difficult to manuver. There was no ethernet cable available in the room as advertised, so we were unable to access the internet from our computer, forcing us to use the internet via the tv. The keypad remote used to surf the internet did not work very well and we were forced to abandoned our cause. Unfortunately, our television would not work after that and maintenance had to be called to fix the problem. The repairman was perplexed with what to do to fix the issue, and we waited with him for about 45 minutes in a small room thinking of what we should do with ourselves in the meantime. Once he figured it out we thanked him and decided it would be best not to use the internet again which was sad because we paid something like $15.99 for the service we could no longer use. As a personal opinion perhaps not shared by others, it has always bothered me for a really nice pricey hotel to charge for internet service. It feels like I am being nickeled and dimed. About the time we were saying goodbye to our repairman we realized that some of our bags were missing. This is when I discovered that the bellman did not listen when I said please bring all of mine and my wife's bags to the room. I immediately went down to see where the breakdown was stopping at the valet desk to discuss the problem. The valet apologized and said he would correct the problem. I waited to see what the results would be for about 15 minutes. When nothing happened I asked what the problem was. The valet began asking me about the color and make of my vehicle. He apologized and said that his staff couldn't find the car. Realizing of course, he could do nothing for me and perhaps wanting to dodge the bullet, turned me over to the manager who behaved as if I was bothering him. He was impatient and somewhat inconsiderate of my problem. He never even once apologized for what had happened. Instead he opted to have me go down with him to search for the vehicle. Once we found the vehicle he told me to stay put, he ran away to go and search for the keys leaving me down in a garage I had no idea how to get out of. I found the exit and the valet floor boss no sooner than the manager arrived to tell me his people lost the keys and that the Hard Rock would gladly be picking up the parking fees. About ten minutes later the manager found the keys and had the vehicle into the queue because he thought I needed it. I just needed the bags. The car waited in the valet queue upstairs in the rain for approximately 20 minutes without my knowledge before I asked what was taking so long to get my bags and looking around the corner to see if they had brought the car up instead of bringing the bags. Sadly I was right and the bags were in the car still waiting in the valet line. Once I saw this I told the valet to bring the remainder of the bags up now. I went upstairs and my wife asked why I didn't bring the bags up myself and I alluded that we could trust the valet's at the hotel to do that. I was wrong and after a 20 minute conversation with my wife I found myself going back downstairs to find the bags sitting unattended in the lobby. I had to find someone to get the bags and follow me upstairs. After we had all of our things upstairs it was time to use the shower. The shower in the bathroom is very beautifully designed featuring a duel shower head system ( the first of which I had ever seen). There was a lever in the shower to control hot and cold and another valve to control water temperature above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The water temperature gage didn't work and for the most part we took lukewarm showers. We already complained enough that to do so would have just resulted in us having to tell the staff about it and that had already proven to just be an addition to our inconveniences. The room service offers very simple fare at exorbetant prices with all types of little costs here and there to expand the company's profit margin. The room service orders took forever and once they arrived my wife's of course was incorrect. We had previously explained that my wife was allergic to tomatoes, and the salad she had ordered was covered in them. We called down to have them correct the order. After two phone calls explaining what we needed, the guy finally arrived 45 minutes later. (What we wanted was just a replacement salad without tomatoes). Instead, he arrived with another sandwich (my order) and a replacement salad for my wife. Of course it was completely wrong again, instead of a the dinner salad she ordered it was a smaller side salad. The meal was comped at our suggestion and left in an incorrect status. The next morning we awoke to find our paper missing. All other doors had a paper in front of them except ours. When we asked the a local cleaning lady what the deal was, she said it happens all the time and told us to simply steal someone else's from there room. Very rock and roll! I don't really care for the whole novelty angle of modern American dining and hotel stay that has become so prevalent in that part of the market these days. I didn't like the whole \"how may we rock your world\" slogan everyone used whenever you called when they seemed to care so little about what it was that you needed in the first place. It may have been if they actually seemed to care about rocking our world. The check out of the hotel was interesting to say the least. The receptionist asked me how my stay was and I blurted out \"terrible\" Her jaw dropped as if I had no right to answer with anything other than an affirmative \"terrific\". She demanded I give her my phone number and tell me what went wrong so that she could pass it on to her manager. When the manager finally got around to calling me the next day she left a confused message saying that one of her staff left her a message telling her to call us. She was clearly not read in on the list of problems I left the receptionist nor was she calling to address those issues. She was merely calling to find out what I wanted. We didn't return her call and resolved that the entire staff at the hotel was simply incompetent. We stayed with friends in the other rooms who were equally unimpressed with their stays at the hotel. Our overall rating was terribly unimpressive and I was really glad we lucked out with a discounted rate prior to checking in the hotel. If you simply want a nice hotel with a polite staff that will do what you need done the first time at a reasonable price avoid the Hard Rock like the plague. If you are just going for the novelty, then bring along some patience for the incompetent staff.", "Date": "February 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "KINGSTON, TN", "Title": "\u201cFantastic !!

The beds are comfortable and the room environment was \"rockin'\". As I checked in, the hotel has the room playing Classic Rock as I indicated my choice in music...nice touch !!

The staff is non responsive (except for a very nice couple that is soon to be married). We called for a bell boy and never saw one. We carried our stuff down and the concierge person was playing solitaire on the computer.

The staff couldn\u2019t accommodate a large party of professionals largely due to the fact the bars and restaurants in the hotel are managed by someone other than the Hard Rock! Why? Good question but we were not even allowed into the bars after spending $500 per night on a room there. Go figure. The security staff makes you feel like you\u2019re in a maximum security prison.

We found a rate of $159/night on Orbitz but wanted to be sure we could cancel so we called the hotel directly. We talked to reservations and indicated the Orbitz rate, which they immediately honored for our stay. A few things to consider: (1) There is a $15 per night charge that is non-negotiable (and not easily found) which covers a 24-hour fitness (not on property), internet access, 2 small bottles of water which they bring at turndown service and a CD compilation of songs you've never heard of. (2) There are 12 floors in this hotel. We had a group of 17 people spanning 9 rooms on 5 different floors. No matter what floor you are on, your floor, bed and barware will vibrate from the dance-club on the first floor (Sweetwater's). We happened to be on the 4th floor, which also has another club on it, and all the way until 2 am we could sing along to the songs 4 floors below like we were there ourselves. After calling the front desk, there were not any rooms available to move to and earplugs could be purchased in the Hard Rock Store. The location is fabulous as it sits on the south end of the Gaslamp District and the restaurants are good, friendly staff, but we will NEVER stay in the hotel again, although we may eat at Nobu.
