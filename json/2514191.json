I think this is a problem of this Only apartment but noone told us anything before our arrival.

We found this property from Holiday-Rentals.co.uk and contacted the owner using the contact form. This was our first time to New York and we liaised with Mr. Douglas Cooper via email and he was very co-operative. We filled in the card authorisation form and emailed it to Mr. Cooper. On arrival, the door man had our key waiting for us. Check in is after 16:00 and check out is 10:00 am but a conditional 12:00 check out is also possible. Rates are quoted in US dollars and are inclusive of tax. The room living area was spacious with a dining table for four, a coffee table, two double futons that convert into beds, a television with lots of channels and a folding bed (that we requested for). Pillows and linen is provided for in the room for the futons and folding bed. There is no service such as housekeeping during your stay but there is a broom if you want to sweep up. The kitchen was small but it had everything that you could need such as utensils, a fridge, a microwave, kettle etc. We found a supermarket nearby where we bought some breakfast items such as bread, coffee etc. The bedroom had a double bed and cupboard, chest of drawers \u2013 the usual stuff. There is also a telephone in the room. There is no Wi-Fi or Internet connection. The bathroom was of decent size with a sink, toilet and shower facility. There were towels provided in the room. There wasn\u2019t much of a view from our apartment but we were 5 minutes away from Grand Central Station so we could not complain much. We spent most of our time outside of the apartment so we just needed a place to sleep and store our belongings. Overall, whilst this was not a 5 star apartment, the apartment was clean, the location was central and it was very good value for money.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockport, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location\u201d", "Author": "lyndajwells", "ReviewID": "UR81777063", "Content": "I was a bit concerned after reading the reviews on these apartments.

The fridge was not working (I think the cleaner forgot to come back after turning it off to defrost) the kitchen was flooded. The shower curtain was not held up properly and only lasted 1 shower and if you are taller than 5'7\" you won't fit in the bed. On the plus side, it's only a 10 minute walk straight up 47th st to Times Square and there is parking right next door if you are willing to pay a fortune for it.. In my opinion there has to somewhere alot better for the price and I will certainly be looking for it next time i'm in New York.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "United States", "Title": "\u201cfor me worth the minor hassle\u201d", "Author": "jonggentry", "ReviewID": "UR54400480", "Content": "First off, the hassle. If you book through a web site (hotels.com etc), PLESE make sure you contact the premises EARLY too confirm. You must fill out a guest card and give your credit card info (300 hold for incidentals). This was not that big a deal to me. The 'hassle' is the owner, whio isn't the warm fuzzy type and prefers email to phone calls. Also no matter how early you send your info you will not get a confirmation till the day before--if your credit card card doesn't cut it--you have no room, he says even if you're prepaid-fortunately mine cut it, lol) How ever, he is prompt insending you the info and the guys at the front desk are very nice I thought- IF you are like me and prefer an apartment to a hotel room, this is PERFECT-if you need to have someone clean up after you make the beds for you this isn't the place-it's NOT a hotel, it's an apartment building. The lace was very clean when I got there lots of space (and I had a studio). kitchen, bed futon fold out couch and a roll away bed, dining table-there are laundry facilities but the machine to by your card was out-I was told I would have to call myself by the maintenance staff--one of the doorman had one he said I could use and just pay him for the amount I used on it---Over all I frankly I LOVED IT--but apartment suits me more than hotel when I travel----and the owner is not to be seen-he respects your privacy completely-He does ask you leave the place the way you found--I was happy to comply.", "Date": "January 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Menlo Park, CA", "Title": "\u201cMid town Manhattan - location and low cost.

I chose it for location and low cost. I got both. The booking experience is sort of like renting a ski cabin: initial booking, a second step to place a deposit (credit card via fax), and key pick up from the friendly doorman. I stayed in room 7A, with a \u201ccity view.\u201d Clean sheets were waiting on top of the double bed, so I had to make my own bed. I had to scrounge around for a blanket. No shampoo. Mini-blinds meant there was a lot of light coming into the room during the night. Broadband internet worked fine. Quiet neighbors. For the price and location it was a good deal and I would return.

Small, but full kitchen is great, with a grocery store and fruit stand up 2nd Ave. They have five units in the building - front- (2/F, 11/F) and rear-facing (4/F, 7/F, 10/F). Our 2/F studio was quiet. Large main room with double bed, futon, rollaway bed, four-seater dining table, drawers, cable TV, mini-stereo, cordless phone (free local calls in/out), wireless/wired internet, night tables and full-width window with a ledge. Ran out of hot water at times and a slow draining clogged tub - flagged by other reviewers (yet not fixed?). While the apartment was great overall, there were procedural annoyances. After booking online, you get a message to call management in New York to find out how to check in - very inconvenient for an online booking. After getting voicemail (no one called back), found an email online (oxbridge@aol.com), which was responded to. They want to send you a credit-card form to fax/email back to cover any damage, etc. Suspect we could have checked in regardless as the same blank form also in room. The other inconvenience is that you have to check out by 10am (they say you can leave your bags, but only until noon) and then check in is a late 4pm. No flexibility. Otherwise, the guard seems to be 24 hours and had our key waiting. Apartment stays are great, but a risk if anything goes wrong as harder to find help than in a hotel.
