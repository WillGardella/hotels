This hotel caters mostly for the Chinese community. The rooms were clean and the lady tidying up the rooms, Hau, was not only very efficient but also honest as she found an article lying behind the bed and left it on the bed after servicing the room. I found the front desk staff friendly and very helpful, the breakfast was not quite what one would expect according to Western standards but it was filling. The hotel is also quite close to the subway. It is located in a Chinese community, close to Canal street. The room was also not very noisy due to the double glazed windows. The only problem I had with the hotel was that there is some problem with their plumbing system as the toilet became blocked on a day that we were not in the hotel.

The rooms are clean, the bathrooms fixtures are relatively new, and all the rooms are equipped with cable and flat screen TV's. The location is in the lower East Side in the heart of Chinatown. Proximity to Little Italy is very convenient. The neighborhood is mostly quiet except for the train that goes over the Manhattan bridge periodically. However the rooms have doubled paned windows which filter this out a bit. If your goal is Midtown, you have many options on the subway that will get you there in under 10 mins. Much faster and more affordable than taxis. The ferries for Staten Island and the Statue of Liberty are about a 5 min bus ride away. You can literally walk to the Financial District and the WTC site.

The room was ok in size and was clean, but the bed was like concorete! I dont mind a bit of noise outside but this hotel is just a roadwidth from the main rail line with trains passing by every 2 minutes which actually made my window rattle. It is like being at the end of a runway! The area of china town the hotel is located in is very dirty and dodgy and it takes a good 10 minutes walking to get to the metro.

The noise really didnt bother me cause I was up anyway from the bad bed. The water was hot. The room was clean and cold.

The first problem was resolved by itself ie by turning off the toilet pipe, there was a lot of pressure in the bath! And about the third problem, I complained on the second day. Afterwards, the towels were always changed and clean. Otherwise, the room was too cold for me with the air conditioning. No possibility to adjust it (one thermostat per floor). The location is ok, near Canal Street. The tube is at 5 /10 minutes walk. However, I could hear the tube from the room, so air plugs are necessary to sleep.

I am use to staying at hotels that run from $350-$600 a night. Due to a recent budget cut, my company booked me for a week stay at the Mayor Hotel. The rates at this hotel are the lowest I've seen in NYC and there are a few other hotels nearby (much older looking) that charge more. The hotel is fairly new; I was told it opened two months ago. And based on the appearance, design of the hotel, and the cleanliness of the lobby, rooms, hallways, and elevator, it's most likely true. The Front Desk staff members are knowledgeable of the area and answered all my questions in good manners. The rooms are a bit small but not much smaller than Four Points Sheraton in Chelsea which charge 2-3x as much. The B/DF subway stations are walking distance so it's very convenient for me to go to my meetings. The biggest con is that the Hotel is directly across the Manhattan Bridge where trains run by constantly. During the morning and afternoon, it does get pretty loud. At night, the trains run less frequently and it becomes more forgiving; at least to me. My room was cleaned everyday and although I did make two complaints to the general manager regarding certain things I disliked, she handled those issues very well and I didn't have a problem for the remaining of my stay. I did not run into any water issues during my entire stay (1wk) like others have. So I cannot comment on that. Overall, I think for the price, cleanliness, and convenience factor, I would give it 3 stars at least. I think since the hotel is still fairly new, some adjustments will have to be made; but it does seem to have a potential to be a 4 star Hotel.", "Date": "August 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid", "Title": "\u201cA NIGHTMARE\u201d", "Author": "Capitainetroisvilles", "ReviewID": "UR38691758", "Content": "A SHAME.
