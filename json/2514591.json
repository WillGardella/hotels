The rooms are tiny, and our bathroom was pink and purple, but the staff are friendly (if not the most knowledgeable), and it has a great location. We asked for extra blankets and towels, and were given both without issue. We also asked about the best way to get to the airport. The guy at the front desk said by taxi, but we found that subway was MUCH cheaper (subway to airtrain, unlimited pass on subway = $29 for seven days + $5 each for airtrain, one-way). Location is great. There's a large starbucks is right across the street, subway entrance is one street to the south. The floors were creaky, and you could hear other people open/close doors, etc., but it weirdly wasn't very noisy. We were on the 4th floor, about 6 rooms to a floor, and it wasn't bad. Nothing to keep us up. We did go in the end of March, so perhaps it was more empty than usual. I didn't book the hotel, but the girl who did said you had to ask for a room with a private bathroom - well worth it. we paid $160 a night, 3 nights. The heat is central, but was kept at a good temperature. The last night it was a bit warm for my two friends, but I was fine (I'm almost always cold). Also, they thought the beds were soft, but I thought they were a bit hard (I had lots of padding on my bed at home).

While the other hotels jacked up prices to even *start* in the 300s, I appreciated this cost. You might think that it was because this was a much inferior hotel, but all considered it was simply a basic, but clean, no-frills place to spend a night. Some minuses include no control over thermostat (but it was comfortable enough given outside was pretty chilly!), older bathroom fixtures, a manual elevator/lift ( but someone was there at 11:00 to bring me up, so it was not an issue.) And as far as courtesy hoes, I interacted with probably 3 or 4 front desk staff, and I think they were perfectly fine... and a few quite friendly. My overall impression was that they are probably trying hard to build up their reputation. The lobby was quite nice and welcoming. I got there at noon and the room wasn't ready yet, but they happily offered to tag and store my bags with no problem at all. There wasn't an opportunity to give 1/2 stars, otherwise for the price I may have given it an overall 3.5. Bit again, don't expect luxury!

The only problem I had was when I purchased a ticked on the double decker tour bus, it didn't have a stop within quite a distance to the motel, but I just grabbed a taxi and it only cost around $12 (obviously nothing to do with the motel). I was on the 2nd floor which was also on the street, I thought I may have had a problem sleeping with the road noise, but not at all, the price of my room was unbelievable considering the location and quality of the room.

I was glad to have found the Hotel Deauville (they charged regular rates) through TripAdvisor although a bit nervous about our stay given the mixed reviews. Excellent location with the subway around the corner and Grand Central a few blocks away. We had breakfast every morning at Bread and Butter across the street which offers plenty of variety from a buffet to made to order omelettes, pancakes etc. Great, lively neighbourhood with plenty of reasonably priced restaurants along Lexington and 2 Avenue. We stayed in a double room on the second floor with a private bathroom. We requested a second floor room so that we didn't have to use the elevator. Our room was very clean and the beds were comfortable. As the hotel was once a dumbbell tenement, both the bedroom and bathroom windows faced a wall which was fine with us as it was quiet and were only there to sleep and shower. Rooms don't have alarm clocks. Free wifi is available throughout the hotel. Our bathroom was small with the shower located in the centre of the tub rather than one end. The hot water dial gets extremely hot and my friend burned herself on the tap. Although towels were replaced daily, the bathroom was not cleaned during our 4 day stay. Staff was extremely friendly but customer service is average. For example, if you want to make reservations (dinner, shows, airport pickup etc.), you will need to make them yourself. This was not an issue for us as we are independent travellers and I'm very familiar with the city but may be frustrating for other guests. Management may want to reconsider its current policy of not allowing guests to split the bill between two credit cards as its rather inconvenient.

The window faced the building next door since it was an interior room however that was great for us because we slept soundly not hearing any of the street noise (although the AC unit was a little loud but we got used to it). The bed was also comfortable and the AC worked well which was a relief because it was very hot the weekend we were there. There was even a new flatscreen TV on the wall. The staff was very pleasant although they tend to have smoke breaks on the steps at the front doors so you are acosted with a smoky smell as you exit and enter the building. The lobby area is nice with comfortable furniture for sitting around and planning your day. A small upright piano adds character and charm.

I am very puzzled that this hotel got overall positive feedback. I just stayed here for four nights while in New York. I paid $219 for a suite, which is a great deal for this city. They can keep the rates low because it doesn't have amenities such as a restaurant, fitness center or business center. The location on Park and 29th is a few blocks from the train; there are lots of restaurants in the area and a Starbucks across the street. The place is very old and has not been renovated or updated in a long time. This in itself would not have bothered me. I inspected the living room first. I am not exaggerating at all when I say that the sofa was absolutely filthy. There was dirt and stains all over it, and I had to put a blanket on it in order to feel OK sitting on it. Then I checked out the bedroom. The bed had no headboard, which I thought was odd and very cheesy (plus that makes it almost impossible to read in bed), and there was no alarm clock. I pulled back the bedspread/quilt, and that too was filthy, with a huge stain on the underside. It was also very torn. I immediately removed it from the bed. If something that dirty is on the bed, you wonder what else is dirty and what is being ignored. The sheets looked clean, which was a relief. The mattress was firm. The lighting was on the dim side. The towels were small and thin, what you'd expect to find in a Motel 6. The suites have a kitchen area along one wall with a microwave, coffee maker, mini fridge and sink. The bedroom had a window AC, which was very loud; I had to sleep with it off in order to get any sleep. Luckily I am not a big fan of air conditioning anyway. The living room didn't have an AC, but it did have a ceiling fan. Also, because of the building's age, it has the type of radiator where the management has to send up the heat, and there didn't seem to be any way for you to control it yourself. I imagine this would be a problem in the winter, because whenever I have stayed at a place with that type of heat, it is never enough and I am always cold. The hotel doesn't have a public computer. I had to go to the library to check my e-mail. The front desk did print out my airline boarding passes though. On the plus side, the staff is very nice and accommodating. The bathroom sink was leaking and they sent someone up to fix it. There was a bulb missing from the bathroom and they sent one up right away.

We asked the porter about the smoke smell and were told that none of the rooms were non-smoking, but they air each room between guests. So we settled in with the fan on continuously, even though it was cold, to help get rid of the smoky smell. The hotel is in a good location - walking to times square took about 20 minutes, with plenty of delis, cafes, restaurants nearby.

It is a great little Hotel that has very (!!!) friendly staff and the rooms are very (!!!) clean. We stayed in Room 502 (a room with a bathroom) on the fith floor facing the street. While the street facing rooms a a bit louder they have a bit of a view. The rooms facing the back are a bit darker but more quite. I truly recommend that you ask for a room facing the street if noise does not bother you. The room got cleaned on a daily basis and towels also got changed daily. There was a fridge (very quiet), hairdryer, soap and shampoo (everything you would also get in a 5* Hotel). The bed was soft and comfortable. I was amazed by the great size of the room, especiallly after I read the reviews of some other hotels. The elevator was a classic and we only used it when we had too much shopping or luggage with us. The five flights of stairs are easy to handle, even after 12 hours walking in the city. The Hotel is in a great location and we went on foot most times. The subway is just a minute away and even a cab to most places in downtown and/or uptown is only about 10-15 US$. We had a rental car for one night and we could have parked on hte street it in front of the hotel till 8 am. But I recommend that if you rent a car for the day, that you return it at night, as parking is very expensice (sometimes more than 30 US$ per night) in NYC. I chose this Hotel based on the Tripadvisor reviews and I would definately stay again. I cannot understand why some people could write some bad feedback about Deauville, as we have had a very pleasant stay; but I guess there are always people who are looking for flaws or just have a bad experience (this was definately not us).

There is only 1 shared bathroom throughout the whole hotel and it is located on level 3. I think there are a total of 7 rooms without a bathroom throughout the hotel. We were lucky to get the only shared bathroom room on level 3 so we didn't have too many problems with accessing the bathroom. Our room had its own sink and mirror - small but did the job! Pro's: 1. We arrived earlier than check in time, however our room was ready which was fantastic as we were desperate for a good nap before we hit the streets of NYC. 2. Room rather small, but considering it didn't have a bathroom, we had enough space for a bags etc 3. Room was serviced each day with fresh towels 4. Shared bathroom was cleaned daily 5.

The lock on our room door did not seem to be all that secure, so we took our passports and valuables with us each day. 4.

After hours of searching a travel agent proposed this hotel to us. We booked directly with the hotel as it is cheaper. Our flight arrived into JFK early and we arrived to the hotel shy of 1pm. Check in time is 3pm but we were in our room for 1:15pm. The lady on front desk gave us a subway map and explained us how it worked and told us how we could get to Yankee stadium the next day. They provide you with a safety deposit box which we took advantage of -- this is free of charge. They have wireless available for all floors -- again, free of charge and reliable. I requested a kettle for our stay -- this was sorted as soon as arrived - but no tea/coffee/milk packets.... to be honest I think this is pretty standard over here. They [Yanks in general] don't know what a 'white coffee' is so I didn't mind this at all. The fact that they fulfilled my 'special request' was great. Rooms are clean and are fairly well maintained - i.e. the bed and cushions feel like new and are very nice. After reading other reviews just in general about NYC hotels I was worried about space issues within the room.... this was not a problem as there was enough space for our 3 suitcases and then more as we had a 'storage room'. We also twin double beds..... bonus. Hotel is staffed at all hours and all the staff are very friendly and will bend over backwards to help you out. I.e. I asked reception at 10pm at night if they knew where might sell a travel adaptor and he handed me one right then. Quality service! The lift is very old fashioned (but looks cool)..... in the sense that a member of staff has to operate it. Every time we come into the hotel we use the lift as we were on the 6th floor (you feel near dead after using stairs....) and it's always manned with somebody. House keeping staff are great -- whilst I haven't actually met them, we are 2 21yr old guys and our room hasn't been the tidiest for the trip (no its not a dump, just a bit disorganized at times). We went on a shopping spree one day and between the both of us we had around 4-5 large boxes (from electronics goods), a few beer bottles and loads of other waste.... the bin was pretty much over flowing too. We came back into the room and it was all gone, and the teddy my friend bought was at the top of the bed near the pillow....I thought it was a nice touch. As a tourist I would say this hotel is in a GREAT location. Fair enough, it's not in smack middle of Times Square, but who the heck wants to be there anyway? Imagine the the number of subway transfers alone! It's on 29th street and there are subway stops for the GREEN SIX line about 1-2 blocks away. For you folks that don't know, the green line is a 'key' subway line and will take you to popular places such as Grand Central (great for transfers), Union Square, Canal St (China town), Brooklyn Bridge.... and so on, you get the idea. Empire state is about 10-15mins walk if that; you can easily walk to the local sights. There is a subway/ MC D's (if you\u2019re into that sort of stuff) but various other 24 hr establishments near the hotel. You will never go hungry over here. The neighborhood is safe - I've walked around at midnight with a $500 camera around my neck with no issues. I think most of Manhattan is safe..... we walked 15+ blocks after 11pm and there is always loads of people around, shops open, and a cop car every few blocks. People who say NYC isn't safe need to take their blind fold off and wake up and smell the coffee. We stayed towards the side/back of the hotel so the street noise was very minimum. With the windows open you can hear the sirens though as there is a fire station near by...... solution? Close the windows and you'll get a great night sleep like we have done. If you are looking for five star service from a hotel then do not come here. They will help you out as much as possible but there is no room service etc.... However if you are looking for a cheap safe stay in NYC, come here, it's great - sure, you don't get a view from the window in the room, but honestly, do you really care? You're in NYC, who spends time in their room other than for sleeping in. I will certainly be coming back to NYC in the near future and staying here again. Check my pics for the rooms/bathroom. If you need anymore info please do contact me - I don't mind answering any queries... Couple of tips for NYC: -Subway is a great way of getting around the city but watch out for downtime and uptown sides. Some stations will have them on the same platform, others you have to walk to the other side of the street. It normally says on the subway sign, if not, presume it serves both within the same location. Watch out for 'express' and 'local' trains. Express trains skip certain stops and local stop on all stops. -Never pay the asking price in China town, always barter with them! -Have breakfast & coffee at Guy& something (sorry can't remember the last bit) -- it's a nice coffee shop 2 blocks to the right of the hotel. Great coffee! -Do empire of state at night as less queues and top of the rock during the day so you can see central park. -Don't be afraid to ask locals for help and advice if you're lost - if they can, they will help. I found the local people to be very friendly ; I had various people ask me while standing at the road waiting to cross if I was having a good time in NYC (I was going through my guide book so I must of stood out as a tourist) Loads of other stuff too but way too many to list here...... just enjoy your trip.", "Date": "May 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devon, England", "Title": "\u201cThey sold our room!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Iandevon", "ReviewID": "UR13376758", "Content": "After traveling over 20 hours and then arriving to be told in an albeit friendly way that our room had been sold deserves only one star I'm afraid.

We had all day before our flight home, but we could still leave our luggage. This hotel is a must for anyone with not a lot of money and wants great location for all the shops and sights! When we go again we will definitely stay at Hotel Deauville! TIP: if you're getting a yellow taxi back to JFK, between 3 and 6pm the taxi drivers change shift and many don't want to take you. We dropped on lucky but only because the driver lived near the airport. Next time we go we will book a taxi rather than get one off the street.

The staff were very helpful and polite. The room had two beds, tv and plenty of space for clothes. The bath in the bathroom was purple as was the sink which was an eye opener in the mornings.

We went to New York to see it, and not spend time in a hotel room. So in conclusion if you are on a budget and are looking for a friendly Hotel to just sleep at night this will do.

We chose the hotel from an online booking site because we wanted something fairly central but inexpensive. This hotel delivered that. If you are wanting something, modern, slick with lots of facilities, then don't book the Deauville - you will be better suited by one of the many pricier hotels in Manhattan. However, if you want a hotel that is handily located, inexpensive but clean and friendly, then this fits the bill. Our trip to the USA included a visit to a friend in PA, so we arrived at the Deauville in the afternoon of 25th having driven our hire car back to JFK. We got a yellow cab to the hotel for a fixed fee of $45 and that was a good and effortless way to get to the hotel. They checked us in immediately and efficiently with our internet booking voucher. Our room was on the 6th floor (a quaint lift is available for those not too keen on stairs). The room had 2 queen beds and was clean and tidy. It had ample hanging and storage space and a decent sized bathroom. My only slight complaint would be that the room smelled smokey but this didn't bother me too much and i didn't mention it to the staff so i can't comment on how they might have dealt with it if i had. The staff were very friendly and helpful and i generally felt very safe in the area (common sense must be used of course). The lady on reception was happy to offer advice on how to find places - we had booked an open top bus tour and wanted to find the departure point and the lady offered to write down bus routes and/or subway instructions for us if needed (though we actually decided to walk to it on the end as walking is very easy in Manhattan). She also booked a car for us for our return to JFK. The hotel is situated between Lexington and Park Avenues on East 29th Street. The walk to the ticket office for the the bus tour was about 45 minutes but very pleasant as you crossed all the main avenues and a selection of the central streets (seeing many of the famous sites on the way). Getting around is very easy in Manhattan (especially if you have a good map of the blocks) - its almost impossible to get lost. For those travelling for a short sightseeing trip, i would certainly recommend the 48 hour 4 loops bus tour. I know its a bit cheesy but it gets you about the island and the guides are very informative. We had a great time in NY and found that the Deauville met our needs which, as i said, were for a low cost basic, but clean friendly and comfortable hotel. We literally only slept there - if you intend to spend more time in your hotel, perhaps its not for you.

They had booked us into another nearby hotel that we walked over to with all of our luggage. Prior to the walk, I asked about the quality of the new hotel. They assured me it was fine, which was completely false. It was a total dump - you had to pay in advance through a plexiglass window, it was rundown, had one TV channel, carpet that covered up holes in the floor, etc. After we checked into the other hotel, I went back and confronted the sales manager about poor quality of the other hotel. She then admitted to me that she had never been inside, so she had lied when she assured me that it was a quality hotel. I travel extensively and have ran into overbooked situations many times before, but never this early in the day.
