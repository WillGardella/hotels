The front desk person during most of the days we were there was a nice lady - not hotel hospitality nice, but just ok. On our last day, the front desk person was not too friendly, and as we were leaving, we said \"Au Revoir\" and she just ignored us. Our housekeeper on our first day spoke ZERO English, which is OK 'cuz I don't want to be one of those Americans who expects everyone to speak my language. But shouldn't someone in her line of work understand the word \"towel\"? Also, when she came into our room to ask if we wanted the room cleaned in French, we gave her this clueless look because we didn't know what she was saying. So she sighed, rolled her eyes, and slammed the door shut. Nice. Also, our room had a TINY room with a toilet, separate from the bathroom which had a sink and bath. Aside from the unsanitary aspect of touching the door handle after using the toilet without getting a chance to wash one's hands, the toilet room is not for one who is even a little claustrophobic. However, this hotel wasn't all bad. Some people, especially the front desk staff at night, were very nice and friendly. The other housekeeping staff besides the woman I described above were all very nice. The beds and pillows were comfy. And, the bathroom was clean (a must for me!).
