Gardens are lovely. Pool is small. Rooms are redone aged motel. Beds are good quality. Culture of the staff is that it is incumbent upon the customer to tell them what they need when there is a problem and not incumbent upon the staff to initiate or be energetic/enthusiastic about solving the problems. And the problems I experienced were EGREGIOUS: the floors were dirty, found a long black hair on my pillow, the showerheads were not adjustable and spewed strong water horizontally across the shower, three piles of dog poop on the lawn outside our room went unpicked up for a day, the closet smelled moldy (the only place to hang the designer dress I'd bought for the wedding I was to attend!), the pricey ocean-\"view\" room did face the ocean but could not be seen from inside due to the small high windows AND the stairway that was adjacent to the windows (everyone upstairs walked up and down these stairs looking directly into my room!), and FINALLY THE WORST: when donning the bathrobe in the morning to head to the pool, I found an unwashed pack of used matches in the pocket: THE BATHROBE HAD BEEN WORN BEFORE AND NOT WASHED FOR MY STAY!!!! ICK. The staff responded to this extremely casually, did wash the robe and return it to my room, but NEVER offered to compensate me in any way. When talking with the manager the following Tuesday (first chance to catch him and I had to initiate the call even after an email to him delineating the problems!), he also was extremely casual, never offered to comp a night or offer me a free future night (traditional hotelier solutions), but went on at length about how he agreed with the items that were problems and how he'd fixed them or would fix them. NEVER ONE WORD about me the customer, about fixing my negative experience with him. When I finally said something about how cavalier they are and that any other hotel would offer me a comped night, he became extremely passive-aggressive and said that had I asked him for this at the outset, he would have comped me a night, in fact he would have comped me the whole weekend AND given me a future stay for free; but now that I was a bad customer (what?! I listened to him drag on for 20 minutes about his hotel!), he would not do a thing for me and in fact advised me that I was banned from his hotel. ROTLFMAO. Like I would EVER return! I then advised him that this was the problem with the staff culture at the hotel: they think it's incumbent upon the customer to pay them AND to advise them how to perform. I advised him that in the hotel industry it is, in fact, incumbent upon the hotelier to serve the customer who is paying them. So if you stay here be sure to 1. bring up every problem you have immediately with the staff when you discover it and have them fix it asap and maybe comp you a night if you have the seriously disgusting problems I had and 2. be sure to never indict the staff for their laissez faire attitude and responses or you'll get blamed for being an inadequate customer.", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peoria, AZ", "Title": "\u201cJewel in San Diego\u201d", "Author": "liftedhummersut", "ReviewID": "UR61031450", "Content": "Upon arriving to the hotel we were greated by friendly staff as well as taking in the amazing views offered including beatiful gardens and breathtaking sunsets.

Overall, it was a really great weekend away and we would stay here again. Here are some comments/observations from our stay. View: Beautiful!!! The inn is located right on the cliffs and every room has some sort of view of the ocean. The rooms are located on top of a small cliff and there is nothing obstructing your view north towards Ocean Beach (and beyond) or south. This is the reason we liked this hotel. I don't think there is any other hotel in this price range that even comes close to this one in San Diego (and maybe anywhere in SoCal). Room: We booked a Poolside Queen room, but since the pool was under construction, we were upgraded to a Two Bedroom Suite on the second floor 3 rooms from the ocean end of the north wing. The room was adequately furnished and clean. The bathroom had a dual head shower which was a nice touch and you could look out the shower window and see the ocean. Not quite as cool as an in room hot tub (like the Presidential Suite) but better than nothing! Definitely request a room as close to the water as possible and on the second level for the best view for your buck. Ammenities: Well, the pool was closed when we were there but it was still a little chilly anyways. The \"breakfast\" was pretty sparse; fruit, mini muffins, bagels, coffee and Sunny Delight. I think they are supposed to serve Belgian Waffles on the weekends but they definitely didn't when we were there. A small disappointment because I was looking forward to those. The wireless internet didn't seem to want to work for us (I think their router might be broken) but they have a computer in the lobby that was available to use for free. They have firepits! They have wood and lighters available for you to make your own little bonfire on the lower deck right next to the ocean. We made two fires while we were there and it was a really fun experience. Service: No complaints, everyone we met was nice. However, do not expect the service you might be used to from a higher star hotel. But for the price you shouldn't expect 4-star service. It's mostly college-aged kids working the front desk. Our rooms were cleaned and no complaints with the housekeeping. Out and about: We went on a walk south of the inn along the cliffs. There is a trail that runs along the cliffs for quite a ways. I think this is one of the most beautiful areas in all of SD. We ate dinner one night in Point Loma at Miguel's Cocina. It is affordable Mexican food with expensive, watered down margaritas and a really great queso dipping sauce that is complimentary and comes with warm tortilla chips. The next night we went big and went to Piatti's in La Jolla. It is a nice Italian food restaurant. Definitely request a seat on their patio, it's really pretty. This is my favorite restaurant in SD.

Lovely, uninterrupted view of the ocean and cliffs from both bedroom windows on south side. Overall, the room was clean with very nice linens, extra pillow, a good-sized closet to put your things in. Good-sized fridge and microwave. Bathroom shower had double shower heads, although no counter to put your cosmetics and toiletries. Overall, the hotel itself is modest, but very clean and comfortable. What you're paying for here is the view from the patios, just outside your door, no matter where you are in the hotel. We saw dolphins and seals swimming by almost every morning, and our last morning there, a lone seal pulled himself up to one of the rocks just fifty yeards or so from the lower patio. And, yes, the sunset is spectacular. There is ample seating on both the upper and lower patio for eating, or just ocean-gazing. Furthermore, the location is convenient to anywhere we went in San Diego, whether downtown, Mission Beach, Old Town, or La Jolla. Cabrillo National Monument is right next door to the south and should not be missed. We went tide-pooling there our first day in town. I guess my only quip would be that it's not convenient to a drugstore or grocery or restaurants (that are a short walk, anyway), as it's in a residential neighborhood. We had to drive around looking for restaurants and grocery stores. (There's a Trader Joe's in Point Loma on Rosencrans St.) Also, we were disappointed in both Ocean Beach restaurants we ate at - a little Italian storefront place (can't remember the name) and Nati's, which was actually mentioned in a guidebook.

We spilled a smoothie on their old carpets, and they charged us $40 for staining one of their towels in an effort to clean it up. Also, there's no parking. You just find a spot on the street as close as possible. That wasn't typically a problem for us, but it's something to know in advance. The ugly: The hotel. Maybe I came in with the wrong expectation. I sort of expected \"Holiday Inn Express\" appearance and quality, but instead saw a pretty tired little motel. As I mentioned before, the courtyard made the stay worthwhile for us. The room itself left a lot to be desired, but for the price I suppose it wasn't totally unreasonable.", "Date": "July 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWould definitely stay here again!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5421661", "Content": "Spent one week here on family vacation with two children (ages 4 and 6). The room was clean and quiet. Housekeeping was excellent. We had a one room suite with a fold out couch for the boys. The staff was friendly and seemed to really like kids. The other guests at the Inn were also friendly and nice. The Inn is located in a quiet and safe neighborhood. It was easy to get around to most points in San Diego (harbor, balboa park, point loma, seaworld, mission beach) without hitting the Interstate. The heated pool was a hit with the kids. One night we ordered chinese and a 20something San Diego native appeared at the door with the food. He politely asked if these were vacation homes or something. When I said yes, he replied that he had lived in San Diego all his life and didn't even know the Inn was there. He then looked at the ocean and remarked - it doesn't get any better than this.

The well-documented views lived up to their reputation, and the Inn is in a nice, quieter, more residential spot than many other area hotels (yet still close to gaslamp, etc). The Inn provides very comfy louge chairs from which to contemplate the waves, and the feeling of peace and serenity that overcomes you is great. King Studio has a lovely view but is a bit small. Staff is nice but not so hot on restaurant recommendations and not great at giving directions--do your homework in advance.", "Date": "May 8, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Inn at Sunset Cliffs", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d115613-Reviews-The_Inn_at_Sunset_Cliffs-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$149 - $313*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1370 Sunset Cliffs Blvd</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92107</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515459", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/d1/9f/e6/remodel-sunset.jpg"}}
