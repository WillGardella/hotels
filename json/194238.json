The hotel is easy to find (in the corner of E.39th street and Lexington Ave) and just a few blocks from Grand Central Station. A walk to Times Square takes about 15-20 minutes. Location is perfect and since it is not the trendiest neighborhood, the price range is moderate. There was some sort of renovation going on in the building but not in this precise hotel. The room was a bit worn from here and there but clean and spacious enough for two. The noise from the streets (our room was facing the Chrysler Building) could disturb someone but we slept good. Service was OK and friendly, and we got suggested to take a private car (SUV) to take us to the airport. It was a little more expensive than a taxi but much much more comfortable with several big bags. The room had a free wifi and they kept our luggage the last day while we were out getting lunch. There are some nice convenience stores, coffee shops, nail salons, barber shops etc in the neighborhood, so there's a lot to do there too, if you don't want to go and join the fuss on Times Square.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel in Manhattan\u201d", "Author": "fagana", "ReviewID": "UR126798951", "Content": "We stayed for two nights. We were impressed by the size of the room and the modern decor. On closer inspection, you see it's an old property that has been nicely camouflaged with modern fixtures.

We stayed during the week that it was really hot (80s) and it was impossible to sleep from the noise that infernal machine made, it was like having a drill going off every 45 seconds. We finally had to shut it off and endure the heat just to get some shut eye. The room was pretty clean.

The hotel was good - staff very pleasant. The best thing is its location in MidTown. Its on the corner of Lexington Ave (Scotty's diner a great place for breakfast 30 yds from the hotel door). Its only 5 mins walk from Grand Central Terminal and 15 mins walk frm Times Square. There are 2 hotels(The Court and The Tuscany next to each other - they are refurbishing the one next door I think.) Reception area small and on the whole the hotel is in an older style rather than a modern, light, airy style - but thats not a criticism, just a comment. The bar was dark and atmospheric and the music was trendy and quite loud - not a problem for us, but I think some people have mentioned noisy rooms above the bar, which I can imagine listening to the music in there. |We upgraded to a terrace room - but be warned, if you do the same make sure you get a decent terrace. We moved rooms initially as I had booked the terrace suite after looking at the photos on the website - and the terrace they gave us first was scruffy and tiny with a rotten view. I told them this wasnt what was represented on the website and they changed it immediately without any hassle. (We were told we couldnt move to the one next to us, which had a lovely terrace as that was the owners one - it looked like the one the photo was taken in, which isnt fair of course! ) Our terrace room was a lovely size, a big bedroom with a walk in closet and a second large lounge with a very comfy sofa bed. Bose radios, dressing gowns, mini bar, nice furnishings, large tv in each room - very nice, no complaints. Bathroom was a little small, but absolutely fine. We didnt eat in the hotel so I cant comment on the food. I would certainly stay here again, the size of the room was the biggest positive, together with its general location.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAverage hotel, great location.\u201d", "Author": "Suzft", "ReviewID": "UR126701281", "Content": "We got this hotel on a Hotwire deal.

I was staying in DC for a month and decided to head down for the weekend and didn't even know it was a holiday. Wound up booking at the Tucscany when it was still a W hotel. Showed up there and when I walked into the lobby area I was extremely happy when I thought about how much I had paid. Then as I was checking in I got metaphorically sucker punched. They had overbooked. I had no room. They said to quickly head on down to the Court, which was a sister W just a couple of buildings over on the same side of the street. Thinking the worse, I just went there and prepared for looking for taking a stroll looking for another place. I walked into a small dark lobby area, but looked quite chic. I must have been part Irish that day cause they initially said no rooms, but when they checked there was a couple of last minute cancellations and I got one of the rooms. Got my key and headed up to the room via a cool stainless steel elevator and when I got to my floor walked into what I thought was a club. The hallway was dark with minimal lighting and furnished with contemporary chic furnishings. Finding the room took a little effort at first because of the darkness, but soon figured out that the numbers were backlit so turned out to be quite easy after a while. Got to the room and was greeted by a huge bright room that looked simple but luxurious at the same time. The room came with a king size bed, large desk with plush velvety chair, heavy fabric black out curtains, comfy lounge chair, and a TV console although the TV itself was a flat screen mounted to the wall. The bathroom was also nice and large compared to typical bathrooms and came with super fluffy towels and great toiletries. Overall a great stay, not only for the comfort of the room, but the location of the hotel is in a nice quiet area, but close to many great NY places like Grand Central, Bryant Park, and the UN building.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cOur home in NYC\u201d", "Author": "Matt M", "ReviewID": "UR126651265", "Content": "Quite simply, The Court is our home in NYC. I have stayed solo, with my significant other and with our kids and we have had a fabulous stay each time. The views of the Empire State Building are fantastic if you are on the SW corner...really stunning. The location is fantastic as we were able to walk a few blocks to Grand Central, 5th Ave., Central Park and many other great spots. Times Square is a short and inexpensive cab ride away. Once you are ready to wrap up the day, it really is like coming home to The Court. All of the suites are very large and well appointed with a chic decor and nice little touches. The beds are very good and the large sitting areas are great for entertaining friends before going out at night. The bar downstairs is hip but friendly and all the other hotel amenities are great. We always check out a little early to enjoy our last day in the city, and the concierge desk always does a great job taking care of our bags. If you really want to know what sets The Court apart, I have three words for you: Maria, Maria, Maria. Ms. Maria works at the front desk and is an absolute angel. I have stayed in great hotels all over the world and I have never encountered anyone in the hospitality industry who is as friendly, helpful, charming and so willing to go above and beyond to make sure our stay is stellar--each and every time, every single day. You can stay in lots of nice hotels in NYC, but you can only stay at one that has Maria. Her manager (I believe his name is Chris) is also a wonderful host and they are both extraordinarily accommodating and willing to go the extra mile. The rest of the staff is very friendly and helpful is well. They are doing something right at The Court. In summary: great location, large rooms above our expectations, amazingly good staff, and not just a good but a GREAT value overall. This is our home in NYC and we always feel like we are visiting family each time we stay. The Court is the only place we will stay in New York.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chester, England", "Title": "\u201cFirst Visit to NY.

It was our first visit to NY and we were very impressed.Would we stay here again? Most definately. We make regular reviews on this site and are more than happy to assist anyone should you wish to contact us. We will try and give a good guide to NY which we were able to complete during our stay. We flew into JFK and had purchased coach transfers each way over the inet back in the UK with 'New York Airport Service'. It was a total of $50 for the two of us, return trip with two cases which we thought was excellent value and we were dropped off at Grand Central Station. The hotel is a 3-4 min walk into 39th St and Lexington. We had emailed the hotel prior to arrival and had been allocated a room on the 14th floor with great views of the Chrysler building. Try and ask for a room high up. It gives you good views and at night is a little quieter with all the sirens and horns sounding from the city. The hotel and staff were first class and the room was plenty big enough and the bed was really comfortable. We decided to eat and drink away from the hotel so cant comment on their facilities but the bar looked really friendly. Thanks to all the staff and reception staff who were always so cheerful and helpful. Grab a tour map at reception. We arrived about 4pm so after checking in just went for a walk round the corner to Grand Central Station which is a must. We had heard of the Oyster Bar Restaurant and had a lovely meal that evening. Yes it is quite expensive but the food is to die for and the setting is lovely. We loved it that much we went back on our last night. Each morning we got up early and planned our day. Each morning we walked out of the front of the hotel and across the road to Scotty's diner which is open 24 hrs. The staff here are excellent and the food was lovely and very reasonable prices. Have a look at the layout of NY prior to arrival and we decided to divide the city in half from where our hotel was. So next day we covered the lower area of NY. As most people know the city is split. Streets run top to bottom and Avenues run left to right. The streets are 'West' and 'East' and the divide is Fifth Avenue. We saw that it took about a minute to walk between streets and about 3-4 minutes between avenues which might be a good guide to decide how long it might take to walk. We took the train to Brooklyn Bridge from Grand Central $2.50 each, one way. Took about 15 mins and the train actually stops at B Bridge and goes no further. Its a short walk up the steps and the bridge is straight in front of you. We walked across the bridge (Took approx 15-20 mins). At the end of the bridge the path goes either left or right. Take the left hand side and go down the steps and back underneath the bridge. The road is a short walk down to the waters edge for brilliant views of NY. We walked back across the bridge and made the short walk to Ground Zero which was very sad but has been made to look so beautiful. We then walked down to the water front and took the free boat trip across to Statten Island. It takes approx 10 mins and goes past the Staue of Liberty for those photos. You have to get off the ferry but then get straight back on it for the return journey. We decided to walk back to our hotel which took approx 90 mins walking up wall street and onto Broadway which takes you right up to Times Square an amazing place. Hustle and bustle day and night. We were going to try and visit a show but were so busy during the day, by the time we had eaten and had a drink the evening had gone. We went to a couple of Irish Bars just off Times Square which were great value for money for something to eat. Drink is expensive though. $7 for a guinness !! The Toys R Us store is situated here as is the three floor M&M's store. We decided to go up the Rockefeller Tower for views and is was brilliant. Great views of the Empire State Building and Central Park in the opposite direction. There are shops and an oudoor ice rink at the bottom (see pic) We visited the usual stores, Bloomingdales at 59th St & Lexington, Macy's at 151 West 34th St and Tiffany's on 57th St & 5th Av. In Tiffany's go to the third floor. Necklaces and bracelets range from $150 - $400. You will see 'Hop on Hop off' buses all over the city. We bought a two day pass for the blue coloured buses but would use the red coloured ones next time. There seemed more of these buses and were more frequent. The two day ticket also included the night tour which is a must. We got on the bus around 7pm from Times Square and it goes all round the lower half of the city and across the water to Brooklyn for brilliant views of NY at night. Takes about 2 hours but its an open top bus so wrap up well as it get breezy when the bus is on the move. As we had walked most of the lower part of the city we took the bus tour of the upper side of town. It goes around central park, past where John Lennon was shot & killed, past a couple of museums and into Harlem then back alongside the Hudson River and back to where we got on by Times Square. The two day pass gave $10 off a meal at Planet Hollywood in Times Sqare which we went to. We both had a staek which was excellent and a great place to eat. We took a horse and carriage ride through central park which was nice ($50) and decided to walk back through the park past the outdoor skating rink (pic) If you want a hotel that is central to most things then you cant go wrong at this one.

We were also given a free wifi password, which we had expected to have to pay for. The location of the hotel is excellent, just a short walk to the subway at Grand Central Station and with Scotty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Blooms diners providing good value food just around the corner on Lexington Avenue, and Nirvana offering stylish Indian food in between them. Our room was huge with a spacious sitting area, large screen TV and sound system. The bed was also enormous and very comfortable but the bathroom was a bit small. It was all very clean but the room was also pretty tired. The bathroom had not had a refit for many years and the TV and sound system were ancient. We were only able to get a black & white picture from the DVD player, which the technician was unable to sort out, and on our last night the sound gave up all together. Our biggest issue however was with clunking heater pipes which happened every few hours, day and night. It was still preferable to the hotel above a fire house that we stayed in on our last visit to New York, but it did not make for a good nights sleep. I would not want to give the impression that it is a bad place to stay. We enjoyed our stay, and at the price we paid it was very good value for money considering its location, but it was not the height of luxury that the web site suggested.

The bedroom was large with a good king size bed, en suite bathroom facilities and mini bar. The hair dryer provided was a bit useless but did its job eventually. Good, hot shower and plenty of clean towels daily, even toiletries were replaced every day which was nice. There is a mini bar in the room but as you'd expect it was very expensive.

We questioned the hotel about the clothes several times, and they keep saying that they were still searching. On our last day (3 days after) we checked out, leaving the receipt of the clothes and our address, as if they found, they can sent it to us, or refund our credit card, if they lost our clothes forever. Since then i didnt received the clothes, neither the refund, they do not answer my emails anymore (i sent them 4 emails before writing a bad review). Our bill was more than 1.000 dollars, and the refund, less than 30 usd, just the exact amount of we pay to replace our missing clothes. I would not recommend st giles, there is a lack of attention in their faults, nobody of the staff felt responsible for that, and they started to ignore the costumer who want to solve the problem in a correct way.

Their location is awesome. You are two blocks away from Grand Central Station yet in more of a neighborhood area. There are also great restaurants within walking distance. This hotel was ranked as a 4-Star Hotel, but what I saw was less than 4-Star quality. While the rooms are gigantic (600-700 sf) and seem like apartments, the furnishings were on the cheap side and the carpets were worn and threadbare. Our air conditioning didn't work when we first arrived and the handyman told us that if we switched on a floor lamp, it would cause the air to turn off! The Master Bedroom had a very comfortable bed but for some reason, every time I laid down on the covers, I started sneezing. The bathroom was nice but very small. There was a mini fridge but no microwave or sink. We had a corner room, that faced Lexington, but the traffic wasn't bothersome at all. The Valet's and doormen were super helpful and they went out of their way to hail cabs or give directions. There is also a bar attached to the hotel right off the lobby. You get free Wifi in the lobby area but it is very, very small with limited seating. The St. Giles has two locations, right next to each other (The Court and The Tuscany ). You can use the spa or business center at The Tuscany and we even received food vouchers for $30 per day, that could be used at the restaurant at The Tuscany. We didn't ever make it there but the vouchers could also be used for the mini bar items. The rooms are HUGE in the St. GIles but after staying at the Affinia Dumont, which is only five blocks away, the St. Giles isn't even in the running anymore. The Affinia Dumont's rooms were much nicer and much more upscale. There are more and better restaurants all around the Affinia Dumont and they also have full kitchen's which further push them higher up the rating scale. If your choice is a regular hotel room in Manhattan or a suite at the St. Giles, then I would book the St. Giles for room size alone. A safety precaution yet a detriment - At the St. GIles, you have to use your room key in the elevator, each time you go up. That is great for security but a pain if you are carrying a lot of items.

This hotel was absolutely perfect! Had emailed before hand to request room with a nice view. Upon check-in we were told our room had been upgraded to a slightly larger room than what we had booked. The room was fantastic, very large and spacious - not what you would normally expect for a city hotel. We were on the 14th floor with a view of the Empire State Building! Room had a radio/alarm clock with iPod/USB connection, phone, mini bar/snacks (good selection), plenty of wardrobe space/drawers, heating/air con controls, hair dryer, iron + board, safe, really comfy bed/pillows/duvet, large flat screen TV with plenty of channels, DVD/VCR and pay per view on-demand programmes. There was also a really comfy sofa by the window to chill out on. There is alot of street noise but you are in NYC. Bathroom was smaller but still a good size, selection of toiletries, bath robe and a great shower. Received morning papers and a couple of magazines. There was also a good book about NY in the room. Free wi-fi in the lobby, extra charge if you want to use it in your room. Staff were very friendly, room was cleaned every day no problems. Although we didn't go there, you are allowed to use the facilties/bar of sister hotel next door, the Tuscany. The central location made it a perfect base to explore the city. Grand Central Terminal is about 10 minutes away and this is where the NYCAirporter bus from JFK drops off, so very easy to get to. Check out was 12 noon. There is a place to leave your luggage in the lobby, its tagged and locked away - very useful as we were not leaving until around 4PM. Staff more than happy to help with directions, taxi's, transport back to airport. LEX bar looks brilliant, great music too. Mini bar/snacks in room are quite expensive but we expect this now in city hotels. There is a shop nearby which we went to for water/snacks for the room. This is a high quality hotel for a very reasonable price (we booked through Expedia). Very stylish, modern, trendy and there is a really good atmosphere. Perfect central location.

Maybe I was in a parallel universe because my room was small, overwhelmingly noisy and poorly designed and organized. The windows were filthy, the thermostat completely non-functional, the room was dark (until I figured out how to plug in a lamp), the bed sagged and the TV/VCR combo was located on a conference table parallel to the side of the bed so that it was impossible to use - without being a contortionist or courting a back injury. I had a massive walk-in closet, a separate room that contained nothing but a mini-bar - I requested a coffee maker and then couldn't plug it in in the mini-bar room - no reachable electrical outlet. There was a third room that held nothing but a safe, securely placed on a high shelf. It would have been preferable to have a room large enough to put the TV at the foot of the bed. Why the safe needed a room of its own, I haven't a clue. And I really didn't need a massive walk-in closet - I don't think many travelers do - most of us try to take only carry-on luggage so we don't have enough clothing to use a walk-in. The street noise was horrible; the room had a window air conditioner and this contributed to the high decibel level. Luckily, I had ear plugs! The water pressure in the shower was excellent; but, I never had a single washcloth; I had several bottles of hair conditioner but no shampoo; on 2 of the 4 days I never got a replacement bath mat.

However, I was left thinking it was \"just alright\" but nothing to write home about, although I am writing to Trip Advisors about it! I agree with a lot of the reviewers here that it is looking a little tired, expecially the bathrooms. I normally don't pick a hotel if I can't see a photo of the bathroom as I am quite particular about the style but because the bedrooms looked like they fulfilled the boutique look I prefer and the reviews were on the whole positive I took a punt. Whilst the bathrooms were clean, I cannot fault them on that, they definitely need updating and the drainage was very poor. Every time I had a shower I found myself ankle deep in water and it took a long time for the water to drain away after I had finished with it. The bath also has a shower curtain, something I hate and I think by 2011 baths with showers should certainly have a shower screen or even just do away with the bath and have a walk in shower instead; the curtain was at least clean. The bedroom was a good size, bed slightly larger than a King and comfy. The room also had a sofa and large table (not sure if that is standard or not but we booked a standard room). There was a mini bar that was good for chilling our water and duty free wine. The maid service was very good though. The air conditioning was effective but noisy so a good tip is to leave it on whilst you are out of the room to keep it cool and then turn it off when you are asleep. We were on a floor that was quite high up so no complaints about the traffic, so can't comment on the level of noise lower down and we could see the Empire State Building from our window. The staff were friendly, although we didn't need to bother them too much. The concierge was helpful and booked a trip for us without any problems, although she neglected to tell us what time we had to turn up at the location, luckily the British way of turning up early paid off or we would have missed it! The communal areas were a little dark which wouldn't have been a problem had the decor not also needed a facelift, the dimmed lights couldn't hide that.

And since there are no ice machines on the guest floors, you need to call room service and ask them to deliver a bucket of ice. On our first night, it took over 30 minutes for the ice to get delivered to our room. On the second floor, we requested ice again. After an hour had passed, with no sign of any ice, I called to request the ice again, and was told that someone had knocked on our door with the ice and no one had answered. This was an outright lie, since there is no way neither one of us would have failed to have heard a knock on the door. A short while later, the ice finally arrived. The elevators never took long to arrive, but they're small and would be problematic for someone with claustrophobia. And the wireless internet is not free, but a bit pricey.

Elevators and hallways matched the lobby in style, lighting, etc. I had the courtyard view room and my friend had the regular double room. The only real difference we noticed was in square footage. The courtyard view room has a small entryway and the bedroom was only slightly larger than the regular room. For the difference in price, go with the regular double room.

I'd read other reviews about the nice doormen, etc. But, seriously..the staff was fantastic - and it really makes a difference to your stay. The doormen were always friendly - and funny. The concierge was really helpful - especially when it counted. My sister misplaced her wedding band in our friends' room who'd already checked out - they were great about escorting us into the room, and helping to find the ring. (Which we did!)..and upon my return, I realized in all of that panic, I left my wallet in my own room. They found it and are sending it by courier immediately. They also had cupcakes and tea in the lobby from time to time (adorable). There was one girl with a slight attitude...but, she's young...she'll learn. The hotel has a great bar that seemed busy every night between Thurs-Saturday, called The Lex. We had a few drinks there, and were happy with everything. Good music... As far as the rooms go - they are big for NYC. And the beds are fantastic. Huge pillows (4 per bed) ...duvet covers, that must get washed frequently. It was very clean, and easy to sleep in. I wouldn't be able to lounge in the chairs in the rooms - they seemed dated, and I'm a bit of a germaphobe. But, at least they're good for tossing shopping bags on. Our room was a corner one with a huge walk-in closet with a dresser inside. There was an abundance of towels and robes in the room. Good black-out window coverings. My few \"do betters\" would be: -The hotel turns the heat off at night (I guess they start to do this in March?) I guess it's controlled through a central boiler, so we had to call and ask for the heat to be put on the first night, and again first morning. - The carpet wasn't lifting in our room, but was threatening to, and really needs to be changed - The bathroom was fine for NY, but could do with an upgrade - especially the tub. But, there was always hot water..there's a rain shower (it just doesn't have much pressure). And our tub wasn't draining well, but they sent someone to fix that with apologies right away. - The room doors are thin...the hallway traffic gets noisy I'd definitely stay here again - the location was fabulous.

My review is based on the several other hotels I have stayed at in the city. Plus: The room is abnormally huge for NYC standards The location is \"fairly\" convenient. Especially getting there - it's literally 3 blocks from Grand Central Station. The staff was friendly and they were reasonably accommodating. The rooms were clean. The price was fair - with the living social discount. Negative: The rooms / the decor was not well kept. There was definitely some \"handyman\" special going on. The room service was the WORST I have ever had in NYC. And notably, the highest priced (and I have stayed at Morgan's, Kimpton, W). It was literally $80 for eggs that would have been tastier from McDonalds. The neighborhood is in a business district, you have to get on the subway to get to the sights. There is not a ton of super dining options on the weekend within a block or so. The downstairs there is a bar on Saturdays. I am guessing this is supposed to be a draw or something - but here's a hint - go to a real club - you are in NYC. We got approved for late checkout but after coming back from our run in Central Park - our room key expired. Leaving us sweaty in the hallway. When security finally came up to get us in our room - we literally had no time to shower before we had to depart. So it was a stinky train ride back. So in short, if you want a clean place - doesn't have bed bugs and is reasonably convenient - stay here. The price without the Living Social Discount might not justify it.

The hotel was in a very convenient location but not in a touristy crowded area. It was only a short walk to most tourist attractions and access to the subway. We booked this hotel through oyster.com which worked out great. When arriving at the hotel the lobby was very crowded and our room was not ready for about 20 minutes which was an inconvenience to us because we had tickets to a show. When entering the room we were impressed with how large the room was for a nyc hotel. The bathroom was a little on the small size but was nothing we couldnt manage. The beds were very very comfortable and I did not hear any noise at night that other patrons had mentioned in other reviews. The elevator is also very small ( very difficult to fit four people and their luggage into one). The front desk staff and all doormen were very friendly. Also coming home at late hours into the late and there being a door man at all hours was very nice and made us feel safe. The only complaints we had were that the house keeping accidently took one of the head towels we had brought from home when they got the other towels (ours was bright pink) so I am not sure how they managed to do that, however with several phone calls to the front desk we were able to get it back. After that we put the do not bother sign on the door so they would not come in and the next day at 8 am they called our room to see if they could come in. If I am on a trip I do not want to be waken up by a phone call at 8am! Also I used a debit/visa card to hold the room and the lady at the front desk said I would be able to use that card without any problems. I used my card several times at different establishments and my card worked but when I checked my balance it was negative because of the hold from the room. Therefore I had to pay an overdraft fee and contact both my bank and the hotel to get this taken care of. My advice dont hold the room on a card that you plan on using if it is a debit/check card.

I may have found it for mid-town. I recently stayed at The Court with my two sons for one night while we were in town for the US Open. I found it after reading reviews on Trip Advisor - the location and value seemed hard to beat, and this is certainly true. The hotel is not too big, the staff are extremely friendly and helpful, and the rooms were great. Fresh cookies, cold punch and apples and the NY Times and WSJ are at the desk in the lobby. Even the shower had good pressure - a rarity for hotels these days. I requested a room with a king bed and a cot, to fit the three of us, and were told on arrival that a cot would be forthcoming, but never did. The desk staff explained that the room was too small for a cot, and before I could get out any argument, they immediately upgraded us to a suite. One of the hotel staff (I think he was the security and doorman all in one) plus a housekeeper accompanied us to the room and helped transfer all our belongings while the housekeeper prepared the pull-out bed from the living room couch. The security dude even got us some fresh ice for our waters. The beds were great, and the next morning, after visiting the Starbucks a block away, which opens at 5:30, I enjoyed the morning newspaper in the very comfortable and quiet lounge. All in all this was a really great place and will stay there again.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cClassy, colorful and the most comfortable bed ever!\u201d", "Author": "Aromatic", "ReviewID": "UR77416781", "Content": "This hotel was worth visiting if just for the bed!

It could use a little love: carpets are frayed and bathroom sink was missing hardware. Bed was very comfortable and street noise wasn't bad on the tenth floor (A/C muffled most hotel and street noise - and since bedroom isn't near hallway, it was great not to hear doors slam all the time). Water pressure in shower was good, tho the showerhead sputtered and shook. Two robes in room and plenty of pillows. This could be a really great hotel with a few changes - some minor room updates and more even service. When I arrived, there was no one to open door or greet me. Considering I was schlepping three bags, a little help would have made a great first impression.

An offer of free wifi and a refreshment would've gone far on a 95-degree day waiting in a lobby. Most of the staff encountered were professional and helpful, especially the woman at the front desk who arranged the upgrade to a suite. The room service charges were outrageous, not a surprise but still always a disappointment to be gouged. There are other hotels, such as the Lucerne on the UWS, that don't feel compelled to rip off customers. Murray Hill is not a very exciting neighborhood but it's safe and an easy walk to Grand Central, Macy's and midtown.
