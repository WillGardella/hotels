We expected a decent but small room with its own toilet / shower. Instead we arrived to find out we were \"Upgraded\" to the Suite. At first this seemed like a plesant suprise until they told us the suite was located in another neighbourhood. The room was better than expected, but again we booked soley based on the location and this new location was about a 30 minute walk from the hotel. At first we were thrilled to be located so close to Sacre Cour but then it turned out to be quite a hassle as the nearest metro station is a 15 minute walk and an extra metro ticket each way through the funicular (for those who cant manage the 10 flights of stairs down the hill). We did find that there was lots to see and do in the new area but again we were dissapointed in the unexpected additional costs of getting to and from the metro (The original hotel rooms are a 2 minute walk). The service at the hotel was unacceptable when 5 days into the trip we realized that no one was going to come supply clean linens / additional toiletries. Call after call warranted a response of \"We will send someone tomorrow\" and no one ever came 3 days in a row. Eventually they stopped speaking with us and when asked about fresh sheets and clean towels they hung up on us. We call our travel provider to get them involved and when they contacted the hotel their staff members came by and made the bed and took out the trash. No new towels, No additional toilet paper. No new soap. No fresh sheets. The response we got was \"Come pick them up yourselves\" which wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt a 30 minute walk or a 10 euro metro trip to go get. It wouldnt have been an issue if we were in the hotel as I am more than capable of going to a front desk to pick up my own stuff if need be. The end result was we had to buy our own toiletries and launder our own linens. Had we known in advance of the change of location we could have packed appropriately and none of this woudl have been an issue, but because of the no advanced notice and the lack of ANY willingnes to help / comprimise on the hotels part, I would say 2 Stars out of 5.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cmodern hotel montmartre\u201d", "Author": "barney2", "ReviewID": "UR124156085", "Content": "good hotel for what you are paying , if you want 4* this isnt the place for you but if you want cheap accomodation there is no better for where it is , great position just yards from the place de clichy tube , close to the sacre couer and other tourist destinations", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Modena, Italy", "Title": "\u201cCheap, but you can see it.\u201d", "Author": "SariBee", "ReviewID": "UR123926207", "Content": "The hotel is in good location.

Like many old buildings in the area the rooms are small and not well ventilated, and since the building was constructed before electricity, there is no elevator. The breakfast consists of substandard coffee OJ, croissants, baguette and jam...

I booked two rooms for one night with the Modern Hotel (3 Rue Forest, Paris, 75018, France, telephone +33143874761) in Paris, France on 3/31/11 back in February 2011. The hotel is conveniently located near the metro station Place de Clichy. However, upon arrival around 19:00. We were told by the concierge that the rooms we had reserved and had been confirmed by Hotels.com were not available. Instead, we were told by the concierge/receptionist to walk to another hotel New Montmatre which is one of several hotels owned by a group of oversea investors. He gave us the directions and told us the new hotel is only 7 minutes walking distance. However, following his directions and with the help of a good Samaritan, it took us nearly a hour to walk there on foot dragging the luggage while negotiating with traffic and steep hilly terrain. The new hotel is located on a steep hill next to the Basilique du Sacred Coeur and is 3 metro stops (Anvers) away from the original hotel (Place de Clichy). The entire course is a huge uphill climb. We were exhausted when we finally got the other hotel and it ruined our original plan to go to see Eiffel Tower that night. We had to climb 82 steps and walk several city blocks to reach the nearest metro station (Anvers) The rooms in the hotel New Montmatre are worse than we expected. The TV in one room is missing and the TV in the other room does not work at all. It was hot in the room and air was stuffy.

The hotel did not have wardrobes to hang your clothes. We were told to use the TV bracket!. The lounge area/bar does NOT exist as this is now the breakfast room. Breakfast consists of one piece of bread and one croissant with tea or coffee and orange juice. The spiral staircase to the upper floors has loose stairtreads and carpet, very dangerous. Hotel security is non existent. We went out sightseeing and the maid left our room unlocked on several occassions. The toilet was falling off the wall and the only way to stop it moving was put 4 beer mats under the pedestal. The views were awful, derelict buildings opp. Lots and lots of street beggars. Hotel night time noise could be compared to a knocking shop which went on for several hours. Only stay here if you are desparate and want to be close to the M. Rouge. The only good thing about the hotel was it was close to Sacre Couer and near some very nice restaurants.

It was actually a lot better than we were expecting. It s a 2 stars hotel, but superbly located, a block from the Moulin Rouge and the turist little trains to the Sacre Coure and the Montmartre market square, also one only has to cross the road from the hotel (in a side road from the boulevards) to find the metro and buses. As a matter of fact, we only had to take a taxi once, after the Eiffel Tower at night, all other we did on buses , considering that I am disabled (or have mobility impairments) this is a great thing. The decoration isnt probably the most uptodate thing, is simple and a bit run down, the lift is a bit small, but considering what we paid for it, I would say is a great deal, at least in our case, we go to be out and about, and it was still a very nice feeling to come back to the hotel at night. The staff made us feel very welcomed, treated us marvelously , maybe that had a bit to do with the fact that I (though studied a long time ago) tried to speak French as much as I could.....but the concierge spoke good English. I took my mum and my daughter and a friend met us there from Spain, we were all very happy with the hotel in general. The bathrooms were a bit run down but clean, and the shower was marvelous. My main concern before travelling was that we went mid winter , but the central heating was fantastic. We had no trouble at all. Simple, no luxury, but very good prices and location. I would love to go back there in summer.", "Date": "September 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle", "Title": "\u201cCan't complain...\u201d", "Author": "Rodie", "ReviewID": "UR7997996", "Content": "I wasn't looking forward to my stay here after reading the last few reviews. However, having only paid \u00a345 per night for a double room with breakfast, what could I expect? The location was good - minutes from the Place de Clichy Metro, where you can get into the centre easily, walking distance to the lovely Montmarte district and the Sacre Couer, and plenty of eateries and bars in the vicinity. The room was clean, if basic, and towels and sheets changed daily. The breakfast was the usual croissant, bread, jam and yogurt with good coffee and orange juice - nothing more or less than what the cafe's serve up. Two people with cases could get in the lift and we never had to queue for the lift. OK, some traffic noise (we were 2nd floor rear) but I'm sure this would have been more pronounced in central Paris and it didn't stop us sleeping well after walking Paris by day. The staff were helpful and we checked in at 12 as our room was ready and they kept our cases until 6pm on the day of departure.

How any respectable tour opperator (Thomas Cook please note) can recommend this hotel to their customers is beyond me. The only good point for this hotel is it was clean, so if on a short trip to Paris you will most likely only be sleeping there as it has nothing else to offer. The life was out of order, so this meant and eighty winding stair climb to the fourth floor with no offer of luggage assistance for disabled ect. The emergency arrangements also leave a lot to be desired. I could not find any way out incase of fire other then the main stairs, and since we did have the fire alarm go off at 0530hrs, this was the only way out.
