Nearby attractions we visited were the Pantheon, Jardin du Luxembourg, Musee du Moyen Age, and it is also a short walk to the River Seine and Notre Dame La Grande. There are 2 or 3 Metros nearby to travel further afield. The people at Henri lV are lovely and very helpful -Unfortunately my partner and I on this trip (my 5th to Paris) had two occasions where the staff lent their invaluable assistance- we were unlucky to be robbed near Notre Dame and the staff helped us with police station and insurance applications. My partner later needed to see a dentist urgently and a choice of 2 nearby dental surgeries was found for us immediately!

We were in a standard room on 6th Floor which was perfectly spacious and even had a bath and it's own private balcony overlooking the rooftops.

How wonderful to report that nothing has changed...the rooms are still well maintained and clean, and the service is truly exceptional. Having had our luggage \"delayed\" by Air France, the various concierges on duty went above and beyond in helping track what was happening, and even made a call to Air France for us. When we requested anything be taken care of in our room, it was immediately done. We can't say enough good things about how well we were treated. We were two adults and two teens in one of the two-room apartments. My European standards, we had an excellent amount of space. It was lovely to have the large windows to open in both rooms with a view onto the park. The furnishings are well-worn antiques, but you do get the sense that you are staying in old Paris, which is lovely. There wasn't any dust anywhere despite the numerous picture frames and ledges in the room. The hotel offers complimentary WiFi which worked wonderfully. We did not partake in the continental breakfast, but did see it being delivered to the room next to us (there are only two rooms per floor, which makes things very quiet). Breakfast looked lovely, and you have the choice of it being offered in your room or in the breakfast room. Instead, we opted to go to nearby cafes for coffee (take-away is available), and picked up fresh fruit, pastries and juice at the nearby market. The hotel is very conveniently located between two Metro stations, and is about a 10 minute walk from the RER for St Michel-Notre Dame if you are coming in from the airport. Notre Dame, the river and the Latin District (with its numerous restaurant choices are all within a lovely walking distance) as is the Sorbonne and the Pantheon. At risk of not getting a room on my next stay, I must say I highly recommend this 3-star hotel, with its wonderful attention to service and its excellent location.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Rive Gauche Boutique\u201d", "Author": "007trader", "ReviewID": "UR126227266", "Content": "Stayed here twice (just finally got around to opening a trip advisor account).

But I'm going to anyway because it is such a great find, it deserves to do well! If you want a charming, historical and typically Parisian hotel in the heart of St Germain, without paying a fortune this is the hotel for you. We spent three nights with our two teenage daughters in a four person room in January 2012 and were delighted. The room was a mini apartment, with the girls on a sofa bed (excellent quality sofa bed, I was concerned but shouldn't have been) and the main bedroom spearated by two internal doors. As with all older style Parisian hotels the rooms are fairly small, but the juliet balcony with a delightful view, quality bed linen, curtains and older style furniture made it utterly charming. While older in style, it is in excellent condition and well maintained. We were welcomed on arrival and every morning/evening with a cheery Bonjour Madame/Monsier. The staff helped with every question we had, looked up opening hours of museums and provided maps - couldn't have been more helpful. While we did out best to speak French, the staff do speak English. The small lounge on the ground floor was a nice place to sit and read the paper but with so many cafes and bistros nearby, we didn't use it often. Breakfast was a typically French affair bread, jam and a basket of divine pastries with freshly squeezed OJ, tea and coffee - a steal at just 8 euro per person and much better value than the 7 euro breakfast at the nearby cafe. Eggs are available is you want them for a little extra. The location is ideal - 3 minute to Maubert metro - although we walked everywhere, even to the Arc de Triumph which took an hour or so but was a beautiful walk. The tourist mecca of St Michel is a 10 minute walk (max) and full of restaurants. But St Germain itself is my favourite neighbourhood. We had a car and there is a garage 3 minutes walk away. However, we were lucky and scored a place in front of the hotel! Don't count on this though.. If you're after a modern 21st century hotel with computers in the lobby, room service and a gym - this is not for you.

Value - good for a quadruple room (2 adjoining bedrooms). Location - good. 5 mins walk to Maubert Mutualite station and 10 mins walk to Cluny Sorbonne RER (catch RER-B to CDG airport). Good location to explore the Latin Quarter, Notre Dame and the Marais District. Sleep Quality - excellent. Comfortable beds and quiet rooms. However, the 'queen bed' in the main bedroom is actually 2 single beds put together and the bed in the other room is a sofa bed. Not a major problem though. Rooms - excellent design throughout both rooms and bathroom. Very romantic feeling. Cleanliness - excellent. Travel tips - get your pastries from Eric Kayser, take them back to your room and eat them on the balcony (don't get coffee here though, it's not very good). Eat dinner at Le Hide (near the Arc but well worth the trip - make a booking the night before or on the day). If you want to be closer to the main sights, stay around the 1st district for a few nights - we booked an apartment on Rue St Honore from \"Vacations in Paris\" before staying here - very cheap, best location and the apartment was beyond fantastic.

Rooms are a nice size by Paris standards - our suite included a queen/full bed in the bedroom and a full size sofa pull-out which was always made up when we returned to the room in the late afternoon/evenings.

Breakfast was from Eric Kayser bakery most mornings. The bathroom is very nice and is equipped with a good hair dryer and nice toiletries. The hotel is well situated in the Latin Quarter - within easy walking distance to nightlife but far enough to be quiet for a good sleep. There are many, many good food choices in the area, from \"street\" food (crepes, sandwiches) to good quality ethnic and French food to grocery stores and all the \"-erie\" shops: fromageries, boulangeries, patisseries, charcuteries, epiceries. Place Maubert (location of the nearest metro stop to the hotel) is full of take-it-and-go eateries and a nice outdoor market that runs on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday mornings. Our fav restaurants in the area include the Comptoir du Pantheon (near the Pantheon), Pema Thang (Tibetan restaurant), Kim Lien (Vietnamese), and the very accessible Pizza Roma, which makes a great antipasto and quatre saisons (four seasons) pizza. Across the street from the hotel is a nice park (Paul Langevin) with playground equipment. My daughter enjoyed decompressing there after a day of touring and enjoyed feeding the pigeons.

The kitchenette was such an asset and we made good use of it by shopping locally (rue Monge and rue Mouffetard) for provisions to put together our own meals.

We took two rooms on the first night, a double and a twin which were very comfortable, although one was a little smokey (to be expected on the continent). The rest of the time, we all stayed in an apartment/suite - capitalising on a winter discount offer. This was more than adequate for our 6ft teenage son and 10 year old daughter - the sofa bed was very substantial and comfortable with a TV in both the lounge area and bedroom. Our bedroom in the unit was very decadent and the bed, large with a fairly new mattress. However, for our transatlantic neighbours, it is worth noting that the apartments are not huge, not by American standards. There is a little kitchenette with a fridge full of drinks for purchase and a saucepan, tea cups and plates if you want to boil water for tea etc. Great restaurants near the university, head for Rue Mange where you'll find a number of snack bars, cafes and interesting eateries,. near by. We didn't bother with the breakfast at the hotel as there were a variety of fine boulangeries around the corner, our favourite being Eric Kayser cafe with the boulangerie next door but one if you fancy a top up of patisseries.

There is a nice booklet in English and French that tells about several historical figures. So the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spirit provides a good connection to Paris from the start. The little balcony (probably available in most of the larger rooms) was a fun way to have morning coffee (great coffee, BTW \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thanks for making it for me on request!), or enjoy evening wine and cheese, once our child was sleeping in the very good and large crib provided by the staff. We used kitchenette and the fridge a few times, and it is good to have when travelling with a small child. Some reviewers stated the absence of a coffee-maker, but really, just call the reception any time, and you get a fabulous coffee service. Bathroom was a good size, always clean. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really watch TV much, but it was nice to have a flat-screen that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take up any space. Breakfast cellar was good too, and we enjoyed the pastries a couple of times, while having breakfast in the room other times. There are many markets around, wine shops, bakeries, fromageries, you-name-it-eries. You won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go hungry in Paris, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for sure. There is a great Chinese take-out place right around the corner. And also little pharmacies are everywhere, in case you need some pampers or whatever. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any of those to be open 24/7 though, since they take breaks during the day. The elevator was a good thing, even if it was small. We could fit all three of us in if our son was sitting in the travel stroller, or take turns in case of the luggage. Some things like the beds may need updating soon, but overall this was a great experience in a small apartment-type setting in the heart of Paris. Many thanks to all hotel staff for making the trip easy for us. We will definitely return in future years. Things we did this trip that stood out (or we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a chance to do before) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a horse-and-carriage 1 \u00c2\u00bd hour ride through the city with champagne \u00e2\u20ac\u201c highly recommend. We were with 2 friends and our son. That is top-capacity for the ride. And going up the Eifel tower was great. Make sure you do this at the end of your trip to Paris, when you already know the city layout and able to tell what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking at. Also, the staff at residence Henri IV gave me the site to pre-order tickets for the tower ahead of time. We booked those way in advance, and were able to get a time we wanted, and stood in no line to get in. Paris is comfortable to see with a child in a stroller. Although we think our blissful faces, no visible photo-equipment, no map in hand, and a kid in a stroller added to the appearance of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153locals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and people asked us constantly how to get somewhere.", "Date": "September 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "mount shasta", "Title": "\u201cIt felt like coming home\u201d", "Author": "siskiyous", "ReviewID": "UR77891973", "Content": "My husband, our college age daughter and I recently spent four nights at Residence Henri IV.

If you know what you are getting, you won't be disappointed. The rooms in Paris are generally small. It is especially difficult to find the right hotel for a family of 6 like ours with 4 children aged from 14 to 22. This is a nice comfortable boutique hotel and accomodated our family well. The hotel is at the end of a dead end street (50 rue des Bernardins) so it was quiet while we were there although the Fete of the Assumption was on Sunday and marched right down the main road practically through our bedroom with the parades of chanters. The location was perfect, a 5 minute walk to Notre Dame, right next to the Rue de Monge and a small market, with a film theater showing classics like Alfred Hitchcock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s The Birds (playing on the first night we arrived) around the corner from the hotel. This is an easy area to explore and just two short blocks from Blvd. St Germaine. The hotel itself is small. We got two rooms on the 1st floor (Premier Etage), rooms 10 and 12 (the only rooms on the first floor) -- they have a small elevator and a nice wide spiral staircase. Having our own floor provided a lot of privacy -- we had two rooms in one apartment (a King bed and a King pull out sofa) with nice air conditioning and a modern bathroom, a very small kitchenette area with microwave and refrigerator that we did not use, and a flat screen TV mounted in the bedroom. The second room had twin beds. You would not call the rooms spacious but they fit our family and were clean and modern with many conveniences that are harder to find in Paris. The front desk was very helpful and courteous. They had our main room ready by 11 a.m. instead of the usual 2 P.M. because we were all tired and had jet lag. Per suggestions of others, we got pastries/breakfast one morning at Eric Kayser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Boulangerie (croisants, sandwiches, and excellent madeleines). We had breakfast at the hotel one morning as well, and it was very good as well.

Our room was really nicely furnished and had a very cozy and romatic feel to it. The kitchenette is a real boon, particularly as the hotel is well served by a wide selection of boulangeries, traiteurs etc all within 5 mins walk.

As in most Parisien hotels its better value not to have breakfast in the hotel - this is especially the case with this hotel as you have 2 legendary Eric Keyser boulangeries (they are almost next door to each other) within 2 mins walk of the hotel. 2. There are also 2 local Franprix supermarkets close by and a Nicolas wine merchants, both really useful if not eating out. 3. Some really good restaurants nearby - the best by a mile is Le Buisson Ardent (approx 5 mins walk on Rue Jussieu) but Coup Chou is also very good but with slightly hit and miss service. 4.

The quartier is excellent: location-wise it's well placed between the Seine (easy access to Notre Dame and the Ile St Louis), and St Michel; there are plenty of non-touristy shops (and a very atmospheric little food market on a Saturday morning on the Place Maubert, just a few minutes' walk away); and it all felt very safe.

I printed it off just in case I would have a problem and I did not - it was confirmed as soon as we arrived. The staff is very accommodating and luckily for me, spoke English without faulting me for not being able to speak French. They put us on the ground/main floor, which I wasn't happy about at first but they assured me it was a nice room and that if I wasn't satisfied, they would try to move me the next nice. It wasn't necessary at all. Very clean room, comfortable beds, tv, kitchenette, and modern bath with hand held shower attachment. They replaced towels and toiletries daily and always had the room clean. A safe was included in the room. They do request that you leave your key, which is nice since they are staff 24 hours. The staff was great. They were quick to accommodate with restaurant suggestions, make reservations, give directions and recommend a phone option for calling home. They have a special international rate direct from the hotel which is as inexpensive as an international calling card. They also have free wi-fi. The hotel is situated in the Latin Quarter and is a few blocks off of the St. Micheal RER stop, which makes it easy to get to/from the CDG airport. It's also on a nice Metro line (#10 -Mo stop Maubert Mutualite) with great \"on the go\" food choices and an open market that runs at least twice a week. Another huge plus is that it's two blocks from the best baguette in Paris - Eric Kayser (Rue Monge I believe). One more thing, a wine shop at the end of the block. My mom loved everything about Paris and having to not worry about the hotel experience is worth a lot. I would highly recommend this place as a moderately priced, friendly hotel room in a great location.

It it hard to put location in perspective looking at a map when you haven't been to Paris but it is very centrally located and close to 2 different Metro stations. It is about a 10 minute walk to Notre Dame, 15-20 minute walk to the Louvre........would recommend using the Metro for the Eiffel Tower and Champs Elysees. There were lots of great restaurants in the area, a couple on the next street over. The Tibet and Thai Restaurants were really good and we also liked the little cafe/oub \"Authenic Pub\" for a relatively cheap beer and food. We selected this hotel as it was highly rated on Trip Advisor and we were happy we did. We had a room on the top floor (I would say an attic type room) with 2 little balconys which we utilized each day. The hotel looks onto a little park so very quiet and private. The bathroom was very large for Europe with a bath as well! We really enjoyed the kitchenette and used it for breakfast every morning. The only downside wa sthat the wireless internet service does not work as well on the top floor so we would take our laptop down to the parlor which was fine as no one else was there and we could talk with the front desk person and ask lots of questions.

I'll add what I think hasn't been mentioned much. We were in Room 62, which was surprisingly spacious (and not just by Parisian standards). As soon as we had made our booking (via the hotel's website, which had the best rates I could find), the hotel emailed to say they'd noticed I'd made 2 bookings and would give us two rooms together - a good start. Communication before our stay continued to be prompt and courteous. we arrived a couple of hours early on the day, and after a short wait to make sure the room was ready, were allowed early check-in. Although the hotel has a classical/traditional feel about it, furnishings and condition of the room were top notch - everything was very clean and in good condition. The room was comfortable, but although there was an AC unit in the room we were never sure what it was doing. It seemed to chuck out some warm air occasionally. The wifi was great when it worked, but on some nights, for no reason we could figure out, we just couldn't find the network to connect. The shower was hot and worked fine, but we felt the pressure was a bit weak. The hotel soap was the best I've ever used. The wardrobe had plenty of hangers, and there was a stand for our suitcase to sit on. The room had plenty of mirrors and lights. The TV was OK, but reception was hit and miss. We didn't try the breakfast so can't comment. When we asked the front desk to call a taxi for us, it might have been nice for them to tell us we'd be charged for the journey the taxi must make from the rank to the hotel, and how much this usually is. It was a surprise to us when we got in. Paris hotels are very expensive, and to me this was no different. However, given the going rate in the city, we do feel this hotel represents good value.

We spent 3 nights here over the last weekend in July, my husbands 40th birthday. It took about 10 mins to walk from the Metro and on arrival we were allocated Room 1 which was on the ground floor next to reception. Room was beautifully furnished and we were very pleased to find a small kitchenette at one end of the room which we were not expecting. This became invaluable as each morning we purchased a fresh french stick from the local bakery (2 mins walk) and made ourselves up a packed lunch for our days out sightseeing! We also kept our wine in there! As previously mentioned, Notre Dame and the Seine for river cruises are within easy walking distance (5 mins) but we also discovered the number 53 bus which took us from outside the hotel (literally 20 paces away) to the Eiffel Tower - result! We also used it to get across to the Trocadero as on my hubs birthday we ate at Cafe de L'Homme as a special treat. If you get a chance then go - the view of the Eiffel Tower is awesome and it looks beautiful lit up at night. Despite being on the ground floor/by the reception desk - noise was not an issue at all - in fact I don't think we saw another guest throughout our stay even though the hotel was full! My only slight negative was due to us being there during probably the hottest weekend in Europe this summer! No air-con just a small cooling tower which we had to keep on all night and it was still stifling. No windows in the bathroom just a rooflight so you could only spend a few mins in there at a time - not great when you are trying to do your make-up!

Firstly the hotel is nothing like the image created by the small \"mood\" pics on the hotel website. The rooms are very standard for a hotel of this size and era in Paris and are not as well lit or fitted with the quality decor the pictures suggest. Nor do I consider it the Gem or delight that many reviews state. Having said that I have no complaints to make regarding our stay. The room was comfortable, reasonably well appointed, and, for Paris, of a reasonable size. In fact we enjoyed our standard room more than the suite, especially when one considers the additional cost of a suite. The hotel is located in a cul de sac and is quiet. While Notre Dame is in walking distance and several great restaurants are nearby (refer to hotel front desk for recommendations) it is nevertheless a little bit on the fringe of the shopping and areas of nearby interest.

There are also many Metro lines within 5-10 minutes, including the Saint Michel station. The Pantheon is less than five minutes away and you can see the Eiffel tower light show from its front steps. The hotel itself is right off the busy streets on a dead end, so we were never bothered with much traffic noise. We didn't bother with the breakfast (although it was the cheapest of any hotel we saw) because there is a farmers market almost every day less than a block away where you can get baked goods and fresh fruit for under 5 euros. One block over is a super market and you can stock the fridge with water and other things that seem to cost an arm and a leg when your out and about. The housekeeping staff was great and always seemed to when we were leaving for the day and fixed up the room then. Overall, if we were to visit again, I would most definitely book The Hotel Residnce Henri IV again. Tips: If you're coming on the RER C line from Charles DeGaulle airport, get off at the Luxembourg Gardens stop instead of Saint Michel. Its about the same distance, but it is far less busy there than Saint Michel and will make your walk easier.

They go out of their way to ensure that not only are all your needs met, but that you are made to feel welcome in their hotel. I am a native English speaker, but get along quite well in French. One of the small things that I appreciate from the staff is that they continue to speak to me in French even after noting that my accent, rather than switching to English. I enjoy their willingness to help me perfect my French! We stayed on the top (6th) floor (yes, there is an elevator) in one of the standard rooms (not an apartment). It was plenty big enough, especially the bathroom. Tiny little balcony was cute, but really too small to make use of, at least for more than one person. There are only two rooms on the top floor, and the single negative thing I have to say about our stay was that the other folks on the floor had no concept of how loud they were! The kitchenette was nice, as it allowed us to keep bottled water, chill some wine, and a few snacks. It's not really robust enough to create a big meal, but who wants to eat in their hotel room in Paris anyway? Lastly, do not be put off by the rate listed here on TripAdvisor or on the hotel website.

We booked this hotel because it looked like we would feel like we were in Paris instead of some ultra modern hotel that we normally gravitate towards.

We like to live how the locals live while we visit a new place, so keep that in mind when I tell you that the breakfast was good. There were croissants with jam and Nutella, cereal, fresh fruit, orange juice, coffee, tea and water which is typical for a French breakfast, so if you are expecting a traditional \"American\" breakfast, remember you are in France and probably won't find that at many places no matter how hard you try. It is located on a quiet street in the Latin Quarter with a metro station just 2 blocks away with a lot of restaurants and markets around. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and spoke very good English - I realized at a later point of our trip (in another hotel) how important friendly hotel staff is when you are in another country, especially where you don't speak the language fluently; they can make or ruin your experience. The room we booked was a standard room which was a good size for two people. There was a queen size bed, two small closets for hanging clothes, tv, a small table and desk and 2 chairs and a small kitchenette which we barely used except to make tea. The bathroom was fairly good sized and had a shower/bath, sink, toilet and a hairdryer. Not a lot of room to put toiletries, but we made it work.

That's the Residence Henri IV. It's located at the dead end of a street in the Latin Quarter, three blocks from a bridge that crosses the Seine near the back of Notre Dame Cathedral. The Metro stop is a five-minute walk, and there's bus service even closer. You'll hear church bells chiming from the two churches that are closer than Notre Dame, but not late at night.

Thus, it's no problem to pass up the hotel's continental breakfast at 8 Euros per day per person and pick up some pastries and drinks the night before, or stash cold drinks at prices lower than the hotel minbar's.

I learned my lesson in Barcelona the year before --- \"great\" reviews on Trip Advisor are often great because the property is cheap and well located. Apparently some folks can put up with the \"uck\" factor better than I. While I don't need upscale I do need clean, well kept and reasonably attractive.

On a little dead end street off the Rue Des Ecoles it was a bit hard to find, but it was quiet and safe. Five-minutes close to the subway too. I arrived late on a rainy afternoon and they had my reservation. My room was on the first floor, right behind the registration desk. Frankly I flipped when they showed me to my room: it was dark, had an unmade daybed as well as a double, and I could hear everything going on in the lobby!! I was bummed! So I went back to the desk and asked for a room change. It's a tiny hotel so I kept my fingers crossed.

Cute patterned wallpaper, a dormer window that looked into an \"authentic\" French courtyard. Double bed was comfy. There was an easy chair, a small desk and small table. The bathroom was tiny (aren't most in EU?) but clean and I could enjoy both baths and showers. Overall perhaps a bit on the shabby chic side, but IMHO it all added up to charm. There was a kitchenette behind a metal roll-up that I didn't discover until my last day there. The front desk was incredibly helpful. Ask for a direction and before you know it they're drawing you maps! Don't think the room was big enough for two, but if I ever make it back to Paris solo I would stay there again in a heartbeat!", "Date": "April 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dayton, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great little hotel\u201d", "Author": "ZeGirl", "ReviewID": "UR15089998", "Content": "I chose this hotel because of the location, rate, room size, kitchenette and raving online reviews.

It is a very nice, well located small hotel. We had early booking at their discounted rated so 3 nights were 549.00 euros, total. We had what is called a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Superior Room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which included a small living room, futon couch, with a small table and 2 chairs, a good size separate bedroom with nice TV, (we plugged in our IPOD and watched our US favorites). The photos shown on the web and the photos on Trip Advisor represented the hotel accurately. The small kitchenette with microwave was fine for snacks and their small refrigerator good for beverages and cheeses. The bathroom was clean and of good size, with a shower curtain. The rooms large windows open to a small step-out balcony, with a good view. The hotel is quiet and the English speaking staff is very helpful. I suggest you have the continental breakfast, delivered to your room. Having petit dejeuner delivered to you, comes with hot-hot coffee and steamed milk and a basket of breads and croissants, butter, jam and orange juice. This makes you stop and take a moment before a day of sight seeing and you get to sit at your cute table and look out the windows and feel like a Parisian. The first day we did not have breakfast in the hotel and save the 10 euros each, as we were going to have croissants and coffee around the corner; but the fabulous and very famous Kayser caf\u00c3\u00a9 and bakery just around the corner was too busy, and we just kept running, and never stopped till lunch. So the in room breakfast is a treat. This hotel is a perfect location. Close to markets, restaurants, metro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, buses, taxi stands. The hotel is walking distance to so many good restaurants. I would suggest Christophe Restaurant on 8 Rue Descartes, for a very good bistro meal. I would suggest you get the Pudlo Paris restaurant guide by Gilles Pudlowski, it was a great reference guide with accurate reviews, and for the first time in 2007 is translated to English. Make sure that if booking Hotel Residence in the summer they have air-conditioning. If they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have air-conditioning it could be a problem as the rooms can be stuffy without open windows.

The bathroom was spacious, modern and, like the room, spotlessly clean. The small kitchenette in the room was very useful, mainly for tea and coffee, but also for assembling the occasional lunch or evening meal from ingredients purchased from the numerous nearby delis. We were very happy with the location of the hotel. The immediate area hosts countless restaurants, cafes and other convenience stores, and the Maubert Metro station is just a short walk away. Notre Dame is a 10 minute walk, and it is possible to pick up the L'Open bus tours from just outside the cathedral. The hotel serves a light breakfast in a small dining area in the basement of the building, and this was included in our tariff.

Overall, we were quite pleased. We were traveling with our two- year old son, so having a separate room for him to sleep in and a kitchen to make breakfast and sometimes dinner for him was a priority for us. The bedroom and bathroom were good sized, and very clean. The kitchen was tiny (about the size of a large closet, with two little electric burners, small refrigerator, microwave and the smallest sink I've ever seen!), but it was usable and very clean; the plates/utensils were nothing fancy, but absolutely fine. The living room was definitely on the small side, but had a nice full-length window, with a small balcony offering a pleasant view of the park across the street. It also had a couch that folded down into a comfortable bed, which turned out to be very important to us, since it ended up working best for us to have our son in the bedroom (so we slept in the living room). The hotel provided a nice porta-crib (or as the Europeans call it, baby cot). At our request, they also arranged for a high chair rental for the week. Note: for any other parents who may be looking at this hotel, the little park across the street has a nice playground -- very convenient! The location is wonderful -- in the heart of the Latin Quarter. A couple of blocks away on one side is Notre Dame and Ile de la Cite. A couple of blocks away on the other side is the Pantheon and the Luxembourg Gardens, which are so lovely and include a wonderful, very large playground popular with both tourists and local families alike (you have to pay to use it, but it's worth it). The neighborhood around is quiet and friendly. During the day the local church bells chime (which I found very enjoyable). Other than that, I was astounded at how quiet it was -- there was hardly any street noise after about 7 or 8 p.m. There is a metro stop about 2 blocks away. Around the corner from the hotel is a great organic grocery store as well as a regular grocery store. At the end of the block is a local patisserie called Eric Keyser, which had really outstanding pastries and apparently was recently voted best baguette in Paris. As a result we didn't have breakfast at the hotel, except once on our last day when they delivered it to our room. It was a classic French breakfast - mostly pastry/bread and coffee/hot chocolate/tea. The service was pretty good - the hotel staff spoke English well and were good about ordering us taxis, etc. They helped me send a fax one day and posted our mail for us. We asked them to make change for us a couple of times, and they weren't always able to do it, but they were nice about it. The one disappointment was no internet access, which became important when Air France went on strike and we were stranded for a couple of extra days in Paris. The hotel has a policy of not looking things up for guests on their official computer, and we did have to spend several hours on a c\\ouple of days at an Internet Cafe called Milk near the Pantheon. However, on one occasion, one of the hotel staff let my husband use his personal laptop, which was nice. That's about it!

One big plus of the hotel was that it had opposite to it a bus stop where from, one could easilly and comfortably (we were never standing) access the whole Paris either by direct bus lines or by interconnections at Blv St Michel. Some of the buses run until late at night 00:30 hrs. It is worth buyng carnets of 10 billets because it comes a bit cheaper and it has the advantage that you can use the same ticket for one route regardless how many buses you have changed for the inteconnection.Next to the hotel there are two Metro stations but we only used the Metro twice because the bus sometimes was quicker and by travelling by bus we could see the whole Paris .Another hint is to buy a 5 days ticket of unlimitted travel with the bateaubus for 17 euros (1day ticket cost 13 euros).You can practically see the most important Meuseems and tour Eiffel by embarking at Notre Dame and at the same time enjoying the river Seine.The last one as far as I remember leaves at 20:30 hrs. Many restaurants both for International and French cuisine were next to the hotel. We tried the Spanish one,the Thibetian,the Indian,the Armenian , the Argentinian and the French one near Ecole Politecnique .We were very satisfied from most of them especially the Thibetian ,the Argentinian and the Spanish one.The French one was good too.It comes cheaper if you order the three course meal formule. All in all we strongly recomend this nice hotel.If the price will not be drammatically increased we will certainly stay here again in our next visit to beautifull Paris. P.S The breakfast although continental was quite satisfying considering its price.We preferred to have it in the room since the dinning room although nice and immaculately clean had no sunlight as it was at the basement of the hotel.", "Date": "August 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cHenry IV Best Hotel I've Ever Stayed In!!!\u201d", "Author": "BostonTraveler50", "ReviewID": "UR8456795", "Content": "Henry IV was an experience in itself!

It is near many of the sights and nice areas, such as the Notre Dame, the Latin Quarter, St Germain de Pr\u00c3\u00a9s, the islands and the Marais, and other sights are just a short metro trip away. There is a metro station a few blocks from the hotel, and the hotel itself is located in a quite peaceful place, at the end of a street, a few steps away from a busy street. The hotel is small, only about ten rooms, but the rooms a spacious. We had a double room, with a small French balcony and a nice, big and clean bathroom. The old style decor is perhaps not luxurious but charming and there is a kitchenette in all the rooms, which is a great plus even during a short stay. The bed was big and comfortable and the view from our small balcony was like from a movie. The only thing that could be improved in this hotel is the breakfast, which was a bit dull, especially in the downstairs breakfast room. We had our second breakfast in our room, which was much nicer, especially if you get some fresh croissants from the nearby bakery to complement the hotel breakfast. Apart from the breakfast, there is nothing to complaint about. The staff was extremely friendly and most spoke very good English, which was nice since my French is not really sufficient after the greetings.

I booked one of the apartments, which turned out to be comfortable and perfect for us. It was not spacious like an American apartment, but by European standards, it had plenty of room. There is so much to like about this hotel, I hardly know where to start. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful and never too busy for our questions. Everyone we dealt with spoke English very well so we did not have to resort to our fractured French. The neighborhood this hotel sits in is charming and quintessential left-bank . Right around the corner, about a five minute walk away, is a wonderful boulangerie, cheese shop, green grocer, wine shop and bistro. And about twice a week, there is a farmer's market here where you can buy everything from fresh fish and foie gras to table linens and jewelry. The metro station and lots of other shops are located here as well. You can easily walk to Notre Dame or the Pantheon from this hotel. Both are about a ten minute walk. The other big benefit of the location of this hotel is the street it sits on. It's a cul-de-sac with a small park on one side, so it is much quieter than you would expect from a big city hotel. I think the only weakness of this hotel is the breakfast it offers. The dining room is painfully small and the menu is very limited. Although, to be fair, they will bring your breakfast up to your room for no extra charge.

She had been to Paris before but wanted to go back on her birthday (14th) to see Bastille Day. I booked the hotel based partially on its excellent central location, partially on price and partially on the rating it has on Trip Advisor. It wasn't the cheapest 3-star on offer but it was certainly a great choice. The staff were very friendly - prior to booking I was in touch to request an early check-in and they had no problem sorting it out. On arrival the gentleman at the desk was very solicitous and spoke very good English. The four other waiting/cleaning/desk staff we saw during our stay were also very friendly and keen to help. The hotel is situated on a quiet little cul-de-sac close to the Boulevard St Germain. The area seemed relatively friendly and safe, even at night. The main thoruoghfare is lined with shops, cafes etc. We didn't sleep in on the Sunday but if we had we would have been awoken by bells from the beautiful nearby Church. The hotel lobby is small with just a desk and a little drawing room. There is also a quaint little lift that takes you up to the rooms, which are spread over 7 floors. We booked a standard double room (Number 22) which was beautifully decorated and spotless with a nice bathroom (with tub) and a little balcony overlooking the street. There was a small flat screen television showing French channels. The room was larger than expected - Parisian hotel rooms tend to be small. Unusually there was also a little kitchen-cupboard with a fridge, microwave and hob. This was of course very handy for our own food and drink and making hot drinks (as, in the continental style, there was no kettle). We didn't get to stay in it in the first night though as we were upgraded to a suite! We were told that someone was staying in our room the night before and had requested an extra night so the hotel kept them in our room and gave us the suite next door (Number 20). This was absolutely amazing, with the same facilities as above plus a full size living room with a sofa bed. The rooms were beautifully panelled with amazing moulded ceilings and there were fireplaces (not in use) and antique furniture and mirrors in both rooms. Breakfast was 6 Euro each, which we took in the room - perfect continental fare. There is no restaurant but you can take breakfast in the small ground floor drawing room if you wish. You can also order a tray of tea or coffee to be served in the room or in the drawing room. We used the residence as a staging post to visit all the main sights - Notre Dame is 10 minutes walk away, and there is a 'Batobus' service that runs up and down the Seine, picking up and dropping off passengers at the Louvre, Champs-Elysee, Tour de Eiffel, etc. 12 Euro for an adult day ticket, 6 for a child. We also used the Paris Metro system: 10 single tickets for 12 Euro. The nearest metro station is Maubert-Mutualite, a 5 minute walk away. The gentleman at the desk was able to assist us several times with times and locations for the Bastille Day celebrations. That's it!

A few days ago I was offered a \"last minute\" rate which I accepted and furnished my credit card details within the period required by the hotel. Their response was they were sorry but the room had already been rented. We all know that the hotels will hold a room for a definite period pending receipt of credit card details so there was no mistake. Obviously, they found someone to rent at the normal rate. I am sure the hotel is lovely but the traveler needs to be careful in dealing with them. This is an issue of honesty. My wife had warned me to look elsewhere after reading the recent report on Tripadvisor of items being stolen from a room at night. I should have listened. I am sure the manager will reply with his explanation of the \"mistake.\" This was not a mistake!

We were very comfortable: while the hotel is small and charming, the room we had was spacious, especially for Paris (two separate rooms with beds, a kitchenette, and a large marble bathroom). There's lots of light, easy wifi, plenty of plugs, and the most wonderful staff -- the woman and two men who in turn staffed the front desk were always willing to help with a smile, giving us information about museum passes, metro access, sites, distances, taxis, location of a nearby grocery, good bakery, etc., and I even got crucial help in a wardrobe crisis. This is in stark contrast to the report we got from a friend who stayed in an upscale Paris hotel last year. Members of the housekeeping staff were also gracious, instilling a sense of security, and they consistently did a great job with the room. The location is good for sight-seeing and sleeping well. The hotel is located at the end of a short street, across from a park, so it's very quiet, but at the same time, it's only a couple of blocks from Blvd. Saint-Germain, and a few more blocks over to Blvd. Saint-Michel. There are a few tables on the lower level where they provide a small breakfast (6 euros), which we found very convenient on days when we were rushing out. The coffee was excellent!", "Date": "March 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Hotel Residence Henri IV\u201d", "Author": "dle4102", "ReviewID": "UR7227949", "Content": "My wife and I spent 7 wonderful nights at the Hotel Henri, and found it to be excellent.
