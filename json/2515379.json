Upon pulling up, I thought, this doesn't look that bad as the outside painting and lighting was somewhat modern looking. I checked in around 11pm-midnight and the evening clerk was friendly and helpful. I walked down the hall and it doesn't smell the freshest. Head upstairs, there's a door held open by a washcloth as it was for the 3 evenings I was there. My room was just okay. I tried not to look too closely. So, here's what I think. I needed a place near Children's Hospital, this property was about half the price of others within this vicinity. I was at the hospital all day and came back tired and would crash from about midnight until 5-6am and then back to the hospital. For the amount I saved over other properties, and the amt. of time I was actually in the hotel, it worked. Or, if I was partying with old college buddies and we had too many adult beverages I'd be okay. But, I would not bring my wife here in its existing state, I would not bring my kids here in it's existing state. I hope the remodel makes the difference for them. It is a very convenient location. Across the street from University Village. In fact, I ran from the hospital to grab lunch for us and a benefit was I was able to park in the Travelodge parking lot to run in and get lunch across the street. There was no room in the University Village parking lot and parking was crazy due to a UW bball game. I filled out a review that they sent to me and I was impressed with the quick response from their team.

It was perfectly clean and there were no odors. I have stayed at another popular hotel near the University several times and because their prices went up and I am on a budet, I tried this one. This room had a refrigerator and a microwave which I had to supply my own at the other more expensive hotel. The lower cost was reflected in the more trimmed down breakfast bar, which I did not care about. No one bothered me at all. I did not opt to have my room cleaned during my stay but each morning the cleaning staff was on hand and happy to give me fresh towels or anything I needed for my room. It felt safe. I never had the feeling of being afraid during my visit there. If you stay in the winter I would advise bringing an extra blanket for the bed or use the heater in the room. It was a little loud, but it also served as a good \"white noise\" machine. Every hotel I have ever stayed in has hallway noise of doors opening and closing so this would drown that all out.

The location is very good as it is located in the university village and across the street from a good mall. We stayed on a room on the third floor and it reminded us of an old, outdated apartment. We had read some poor reviews but we were willing to give it a chance based on the great rates offered to us by expedia. It wasn't worth the value. Although the girls were disgusted by the carpeting, the draping and the stains on the couch and the sunken in cushions, it was spacious and the bedrooms seemed adequate enough. However, all 4 of us received a maximum of maybe 2-3 hours of sleep each. The beds were extremely uncomfortable, and would constantly creak at every movement. There was also a construction crew that began working outside the hotel at 6am and that woke all of us up as the paper thin walls allowed us to hear every word said between the construction workers as well as the constant drilling and sawing.

When I arrived, I was pleasantly surprised to find things much better than I'd expected. If you want $150 a night service, don't expect it for as little as $75 a night (check out the midweek and fourth-night free deals). This is also a hotel that will under some circumstances allow under-21s to stay independently. So what of the complaints? I found the staff very helpful with things like getting around on buses, taking a lot of time and effort. Yes, they were more reserved and purposeful than some hotel receptionists, but one Sandi is worth ten obsequious bellhops and made my trip run really smoothly despite a tight budget. Rooms, a little dated but clean. Mine was by the pool so smelled a little of chlorine but I soon stopped noticing. The pool, incidentally, looked clean and I saw it being cleaned. Air conditioning units are noisy but not needed most of the year, I just opened the window, even in August. Showers did vary in temperature particularly when someone flushes, sometimes I just stepped out of the (powerful) flow for a minute until it sorted itself out. There is a bath option to avoid this. Some rooms are by a door or stairwell so will have some noise, ask when booking if that's a problem. My bed was comfortable and the towels and sheets were not torn or dirty. Continental breakfast consisted of two cereals (varying), packs of hot cereal mix, small packaged muffins, brown and white bread for toasting, two flavors of jelly, apples and bananas, tea/coffee and two fruit juices. More than enough for me. The room was small so many people took it back to their rooms, but it did encourage you to meet the other guests. Location is excellent - University Village opposite, which is basically a mall disguised as bijou shops. The University of Washington is a fifteen minute walk away, including an uphill section, or a bus goes from down the street. From UW you change for buses to most places in the wider area. Don't get me wrong, I can see why some people commented negatively on some aspects, but I have stayed in many worse US motels and hotels and, for the price and star rating, this is a well-situated and good option.

The building had a more modern architectual look to it and very nice colors. The clerk name Zaira was very helpful....service compared to a more luxury hotel. She helped us w/ all types of tourist questions and was not even annoyed...which can happen a lot. As we proceeded to our room, there is a security door for guest only, which is very safe. The room it self had great space and very clean, looked recently remodeled. Everything was functional and in order. The only problems I had was that the walls are very thin, the bed was a little out of shape and it took 10 mins for the hot water to come out...ironically being that they want you to reuse towels to save water?

A friend and I mistakenly chose to stay here for a conference at the University, and from the moment we arrived, the stay was completely revolting. Upon trying to check in, there were problems with both of our reservations, about which the clerk only laughed. His attitude was that this is what we deserved for daring to stay in this dump. After waiting a good 30 minutes to get our room keys, we entered the wing where our rooms were. We were first greeted by an atrocious and overpowering smell - something along the lines of a mixture of mildew, urine, and some toxic chemical probably used to attempt to clean. The hallways were barely lit. Then we entered our rooms to a slightly less strong stink - no toxic flavor, just mildew and urine. On turning on the light, one of the (at most) 25 watt bulbs was burnt out. Turning on the others gave only slightly more light - a nice dim, dank look complimented the smell nicely. The carpeting was slightly damp - I tried not to think about what I was walking in. The room was a bit chilly when we arrived, so I turned on the \"heater/air conditioner\", but no matter what knobs I turned where, no heat came out - only cold air - no matter how long I waited. At least I was able to turn mine off; when my friend tried the same with his, he found that it just kept going - so the thing was blowing cold air into his room all night. The bathroom was crap, but ok. It took a good 5 minutes for the shower water to become remotely hot. The walls were dirty, had various stains and marks, and rusty outlines told us where some racks used to hang. I had a good bathroom, it seems, as my friends' toilet didn't flush, he was unable to get more than a tiny stream of water to flow from his faucet, and his bathtub had numerous brown stains throughout. Oh, and he had one less lamp in his room than I did. The bed was uncomfortable at best and there were numerous holes in the sheets/blankets. The pillows were comically thin - I had to stack two to get a reasonable \"pillow\". And on top of everything, when I figured to myself I could at least do a little work to take my mind off the decrepit surroundings, I found that the wireless signal was too weak to get internet access. I proceeded to walk around the floor, open laptop in hand checking to see if the signal ever improved, but no such luck. The complimentary breakfast: disgusting. I took one bite of the soggy, plastic-wrapped muffin and instantly threw the rest away. There was cereal, but no milk for it. I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried - heed this and all the other awful reviews of this complete embarrassment of an establishment and simply stay away.

We had two 2 bedroom units. It was the worst hotel we have ever stayed in, and we tried desperately to find anything else to get out of this dump. On the first night, returning from the rehearsal, my daughter found that her room key would not work, and that another couple was standing at our other door, attempting to use their key to open the room. The clerk had given them our room number as their room. The clerk sneered at my daugher when she went to the desk to sort out the problem. No apology, just ridicule. He then totally berated our other daughter when she paid for a parking pass for a third car - he even threatened that our cars might be damaged or that he might have them towed away by morning. Understand that we weren't unpleasant to him, we just seemed to catch him in the middle of a nervous breakdown. To top it off, when my husband went to the desk (we were afraid to send our adult daughters back under any circumstances) to ask for pillows and blankets for the bed chesterfield, the clerk handed my husband 6 towels and said he had no more pillows or blankets. Our bedding was stained, my mom's blanket was dirty, the bathroom was shabby and the floor was cracked. Some walls had pictures, some had bare hooks where pictures had once been. The wallpaper was dirty and marked. Our dining room table had 4 chairs (2 of them broken), while the other room had only 1 chair to go with the table. That room also had no dishes at all. Ours had 1 cup, 1 glass and an assortment of broken, unmatched dishes and cutlery. We gave our other room 2 of our 3 spoons. The pots were beat-up teflon that had rust on the bottom. I wouldn't boil water in them. Neither two-bedroom unit was clean and the furniture and rugs were noticeably stained. The door to the deck had no handle, and in my sister's room the vertical blinds were falling off when she tried to open her door (which also was broken). The beds had a flat mattress protector and thin, flat sheets - so when we slept we ended up on the bare mattress. It was enough to send chills down all our spines. This was the worst dump we have ever experienced, and we would gladly have packed and moved on the first night, despite it being almost 11:00 P.M by the time the clerk finished with us. I was so embarassed to have my mom with us, and my sister also renting a room. How can Travel Lodge allow this dive to carry its name? We expected a basic room, but we expected it to be clean and reasonably furnished with dishes, cutlery and pots, and bedding. I have never heard of a hotel not providing extra pillows and blankets (we only had 4 pillows in each room, and were not being unreasonable requesting pillows for the bed chesterfield).
