{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A Very Good Stay Stayed in this hotel for 5 nights in October 2008.The hotel itself is in an excellent location in Addison. Although we were on the Concierge Level, the rooms were well equipped and the pubic areas were well furnished. The pool was good, although probably needs checking every day for leaves etc.Three downsides - the breakfast room, bar prices and internet access. For a 500+ room hotel to have such a poorly equipped (and sized) restaurant means a disaster on Sunday mornings - so get there early to avoid the queues. I bought a pint and a Baileys one evening in the bar - and it cost $14.50 !!! With so many alternatives for bars in the vicinty, on Beltline Road, those prices are stupid. Finally, the internet access. Despite advertising that wireless access was free in the lobby, what it actually means is they provide 3 terminals in a business centre for anytime usage. If you want to use your own PC, you'll have to pay stupid prices.That said, the staff were very friendly and helpful, the surrounding restaurants are fantastic (especially On The Border), and in response to a previous comment, it is easy to avoid toll roads - we drove round every day without going near a toll booth.", "Date": "Oct 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR592343407", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "sjd74"}, {"Content": "ok This hotel is a bad location for business travelers- far from downtown - if you want to be near the mall. It is on a toll road so every time you leave the property you must pay the tolls- a very annoying 55 cents/ 40 cents. The room was ok the evelvators where horrible and the parking cost $10.00 an annoying expense for Dallas where most hotel parking is free.

We had a great time. This was a gift from friends for us so this was special. I loved the free shuttle service. I thought the hours were resonable, after all you did not have to burn your own gas, pay for a cab, or lose your parking space and that I'm picky about. so we went to the galleria and into a 3 story macy's well, the mall was 3 storys. had excellent service there and to truluks steak and seafood on beltline road. I've been there before, but I promise if you go, you never want to go to red lobster again. It is worth the money but it is pricey for most people.I felt this hotel was a little overpriced since it did not have microwaves and refrigerators in the room but found out you can ask for one I don't know if you have to pay extra or not. We tipped everyone who waited on us so expect to bring a wad of money thats how good they are and friendly. We had pizza in the room one night and it was good and the free breakfast was great they made fresh omeletts and waffles at your request. We did not use the pool but it looked nice I thought it would have been to cold but the outside is heated. I liked the little gift shop I found a nice thank-you card there.Not many channels to watch on t.v., but who is here to watch t.v.? The big beds were soft and so were the pillows.our room was a little stale at first, but they fixed that and we had a little misunderstanding with the check-in people about there polices but they sent a bottle of wine and a gift basket up to the room soon after, which was nice of them. There were a few things that could have been better. I think the parking was to expensive. Also don't stay on the window side of the tollway next to the toll booth, it will keep you up all night cars racing all night long, very irritating. And it was to late to move to another room. this was after midnight and lasted until around 5:30 in the morning.The room card also did not work. they were touchy you had to try several times and get it just right or you were not getting into your room.overall It was nice since it was free, but I probably would not stay there again since they have courtyard marriotts all over the place that are just as nice and once you've stayed at the grand hyatt at the airport or Somewhere in Las Vegas you won't want to stay anywhere else.", "Date": "Sep 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR940486045", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "alaska777"}, {"Content": "nice place pretty good hotel an good location put some family up when they came to visit they did not spend alot of time at the hotel but it was clean and service was good", "Date": "Apr 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR102644192", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "n6877"}, {"Content": "Awesome Hotel I recently stayed at this hotel for my honeymoon weekend and really enjoyed my stay.

There were 300+ people in town for a convention and they would only do a drop off/pick up at the Galleria every hour.

The hotel common areas are beautiful and comfortable. The staff was courteous, very knowledgeable and helpful. The outdoor pool area had terraced levels which included lounge chairs , tables and chairs and shade areas under awnings or trees. The pool was small but nice with both indoor and outdoor with swim through acces to both. The workout room was first rate entirely encase in glass on two sides overlooking the pool area. We ate lunch once in the onsite restaurant and the food  service was very good. The problems we experienced were with the amenities. No refrigerators in the rooms. When your in Texas in summer (or anytime) you need refrigerators for cold drinks. Our group had to go out to Walmart to buy coolers to stock our beverages. It is also hard to understand why these expensive, full service hotels do not include amenities found in most hotels that charge $69/night. We had a discounted group rate through a travel agent but this hotel typically goes for $239/night minimum which includes no breakfast, no refrigerator or microwave, plus $9.95/day internet access and they add a $10/day parking fee. Basically, you are nickeled and dimed to death. Add the Dallas Tollway to it and you really are handing out money all day. Don't get me wrong, the room (a corner king) we had was oversized with great bedding/mattress, granite countertops in the bathroom, and stylish decor. (Shower water pressure could have been better.) However, it is hard to justify a return trip to this hotel unless you have to be there for a convention or group event while within four to six blocks, you have many other hotels costing half the price or more that include many more amenities that make your stay more comfortable.", "Date": "Jul 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR212867083", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "JereK"}, {"Content": "They consider this luxury?

A couple of features set this hotel above its competition as a business hotel. First, the mattress is the best I've slept on - better than a Heavenly Bed, better than a Ritz. And not just because it beat sleeping on the floor of the airport like 3,000 of my fellow travelers!Second, the hotel actually acknowledges that you need to do work and so has a great electronics console as a sort of backsplash to the desk - lots of outlets, phone lines, and other plug-ins for all your gizmos so that you don't have to move appliances or crawl around on the floor. Finally, instead of a $5.00 cheapo clock alarm or one of those new weird pre-programmed radios (I hate those things), this clock radio had an iPod docking station attached to it. The room also had a flat-screen TV and wonderful uni-sex orange-scented amenities. And the nice man at the desk gave me a free toothbrush so I wouldn't have socks on my teeth the next morning when I got up to schlep back to the airport. And a free bottle of water, not one that cost $6.00 like the hotel I stayed in the night before.Also - compact flourescents in the guest rooms! Thanks for saving energy, and for keeping the bathroom light fixtures from melting a gal's makeup (even if it was day-old makeup).

The food at the restaurant is very good especially if you like Steak. The bar is huge but the bartenders could be a little better and more observant.
