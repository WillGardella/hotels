We were in the 6th floor with a magnificent view of the Pantheon and Sacre-Cour. The room was spotless cleaned, the bed was quite good, the 3rd bed was ok. The reception was fantastic. Everyone who works there spoke english and helped oss in every way we needed. They really helped our stay to get even better. Breakfast was quite good.

Pros: Location is great and easy to find. It's pretty clean and the customer service is pretty good. Cons: THERE WAS CONSTRUCTION NEXT DOOR and no one told us. We woke up to banging each day. They actually felt bad for us so they didnt make us pay for the \"superior\" room rate, but still it annoyed the hell out of us when we tried to take midday naps. There was also some construction being done within the hotel - they shouldve comped everyone's breakfast or made it up to their customers. The rooms are small- even the \"superior\" room was tiny. Closets are weird and you hang each piece of clothing behind the other. The bathroom showerhead sprays water that is super hot or super cold so you have to use the handheld shower head. It's not a very secure place - they take your room key when you're leaving and when you come into the hotel, you just have to tell whoever's at the front your room #. It felt like anyone could get into any room. And if you want the front desk to watch your luggage while they're cleaning the room and getting it ready for you, you basically watch them take it to the side of their desk where anyone can walk by and take whatever.

We've been here twice and loved it both times. To respond to some criticisms posted here, the breakfast really is good value - round the corner you can get the usual croissant and coffee for half the cost of the hotel breakfast, but it's very limited and if they've run out of croissants (as on Saturday!) you just get a bit of bread and jam, so it's not that great. I recommend the hotel breakfast and find it better than those available in the local cafes. Some rooms (like ours) are small but we don't mind that - they are clean, cosy and very well soundproofed. One thing to say is that the small rooms are perhaps not good for people with mobility problems. I kept noticing things that would bother my mum (mainly in the bathroom: some awkward corners) but for us it was just perfect. You can relax in the bath and drink up all the champagne in the mini-bar as you ponder where to eat out that evening - very beneficial for a sense of well being!

Neither of us had ever been, so we wanted to do all the fun and touristy things! We found this hotel on this website and decided to book a room with a balcony. The gentleman working the desk when we checked in was extremely nice and friendly and kept welcoming us to Paris! He then informed us that we were not only upgraded to a nicer room, but the room with the best view in the hotel, simply because it was open. We had a BEAUTIFUL view, and it was such a pleasant surprise! Every other staff member we encountered was also extremely friendly and helpful as well. The room was quite large, which was also a nice surprise. We ate breakfast at the hotel one morning, and it was well worth the 13 euros. The cafes out in town charge 9-10, and the quality was better at the hotel, in my opinion. It had a huge assortment of breads, cheeses, ham, crepes, etc. It was close enough to walk to a lot in the city, but we also had a metro pass which helped. I also enjoyed that it was close to tourist sites, yet I didn't feel like I was in the middle of all the tourist craziness! My only slight negative about this hotel was that there was loud construction/renovation going on sometimes, but it was nothing I couldn't deal with. Also, we found that although the closest metro stations listed on the hotel website are the Cluny-Sorbonne and Cardinal Lemoine, it's much prettier and easier to take the RER B to the Luxmbourg Gardens station and walk toward the Pantheon.

Our love bloomed in this beautiful city and the Hotel du Pantheon played its part too! This is a charming, friendly, laid back hotel with a tasteful French design and an old style charm. The design could be described as a mix of French 50's retro mixed with a classical style, but I am the not the right person to be describing decor and style. The hotel has a family run hotel vibe to it, being small, intimate and friendly. It is comfortable and clean and I would guess that it borders somewhere between comfort and luxury. Our room had a view of the Pantheon and although the room was of a typical small Parisien size, it was romantic in a French movie sort of way (and not in a choclate box, soft focus American sort of way!!). The location of the hotel is perfect too and the area is nice and quiet at night. The two girls on reception were very friendly and helpful and refreshingly laidback unlike the stuffy, servile, all business-like, faux-posh manner of desk staff in American, British or Irish hotels. No complaints about anything really. The hotel du Pantheon certainly has its own unique identity, atmosphere and pace, that I find hard to articulate! Suffice to say that it is all good and, from experience, I can definately recommend it for a romantic break. All in all, I love this hotel. Only quibble was I found it a bit expensive, but I guess all hotels in Paris are expensive? Lastly, a wee bit of advice. This hotel may not be too the taste of a certain ilk of American, British (and my compatriot Irish) visitors who are used to the uniformed British/American 'luxury' hotel or who love chain hotels. The Hotel du Pantheon may be unique and too far removed from (your very narrow) comfort zone. My advice would be to ditch your concept of a hotel and go with it. When in Rome and all that.....

We had a superior room which was clean and well decorated, of an adequate size with separate toilet and bathroom. Hanging space is limited, as is clothes storage space.

Prior to arriving we upgraded our room to one on the front with a view of the Pantheon.

Breakfasts were outstanding and were included in a 200 euros/day room rate..... great value in my opinion.

I booked on-line for a better rate, which included breakfast. I requested 2 twins to have more room for sleeping than a double bed. I was so pleased when I arrived that they gave us a free upgrade to a superior room overlooking the Pantheon. I had mentioned that this was our 30th wedding anniversary. The room was charming. It's also good size by Paris standards but maintains the quaint atmosphere of a real French hotel, with the exposed wood beams in the ceiling. It really is the best of both worlds, the larger bed and room size you might get with a boring big chain hotel, but all the atmosphere of a boutique French hotel. Also an exception for a French hotel, it has air conditioning. I am used to having to leave the window open and hearing all the street noise. It was quite warm when we went there and it was great to cool off in an airconditioned room.The staff is SO friendly. Breakfast was so-so, but service was friendly and the cave has a nice atmosphere. The bed was very comfortable, bathroom was large, and conveniently separated from a separate toilet room.

Extra bonus is that RER B from CDG has a station at Luxembourg, about 5 minutes walk, and a big savings over taxi. Excellent, low cost restaurants in the area, and with the Sorbonne directly across the Place, expect many bars as well. To be frank, the rooms are on the small size, but typical of almost all three star hotels in Paris. The lighting is rather dim, but to be positive, it also adds to the charm. New HD flat screen with BBC and CNN another plus, although small-sized in company with room size. Baths are bright and surprisingly spacious. Genna graciously changed noisy room on the ground floor directly on sidewalk to a wood-beamed room facing the Pantheon. Viva la difference! Ask for higher floors, but remember that the hotel is small and rooms confirm quickly. Continental breakfast not included is served in an appropriately cave like basement, but also part of the charm and fun of staying in a venerable building that had its rooms and appointments refreshed in about 2008.

I requested a Superior Room facing the Pantheon.We were in room 61 on the top floor with 2 windows that opened facing the Pantheon with additional views of Montmartre/Sacre Coeur Basilica. Our room had a split bathroom with sink and tub/shower on one side and bathroom on the other. Worked well with getting ready each morning. The bathroom has a hair dryer but no outlet for flat iron or curler. Had to use outlet in bedroom area and propped up my mirror by the TV to use flat iron. We had twins pushed together but made separately and very comfortable. I have been to too many hotels with awful mattresses. Slept great each night. There were 2 chairs and a table, corner cabinet for fridge and TV. Amvoir for hanging clothes but no dresser but we just left our things in our suitcases. Also, it was nice to have a safe in the room. The room was decorated just as I had pictured a room in Paris. Very cute and reminded me of a very nice B & B. Walls were covered in cloth and had painted white beams on ceiling. Not large but great ambiance. Cleaned nicely everyday. Service was wonderful. From check in to check out. Jenna and Patrick were especially helpful each day and evening and speak several languages effortlessly. Somenone is always on duty 24/7. Please believe the \"lift\" instructions!. My granddaughter and I got on and another couple decided to test the weight limit I guess and guessed wrong.The 4 of us got stuck in the lift for about 15 min, which to a 63 yr old seemed quite long. It was fixed the next day. The lobby is very quaint and usually empty. They will serve you a drink ( for a fee of course) if you would like to relax there for awhile. That would be my one suggestion to the hotel, is to have complimentary Tea or Coffee in the lobby. Would be a nice touch. We did not take breakfast but the room was quite lovely with stone walls. We had made arrangements for our own shuttle to and from airport, but did notice they can do the same for you for 17 euros p/p. As everyone mentions, the location is wonderful in the Latin Quarter. Not so much hustle and bustle as closer to the attractions. But only a 15 min walk to the Seine and ND. Just several streets behind the hotel is a Square with narrow streets with several cafes, restuarants and ice cream spots. Very parisian. I believe are room average was about 200 euros a night, which is not cheap but nothing in Paris is. Would defintely recommend to friends and family and would ourselves stay again.

Hotel Du Pantheon seemed to be a good choice so we went for it. We chose the variable rate on a room - I think it was the superior. We found the hotel staff to be very friendly and warm, welcoming, and relaxed. I had emailed the hotel with some questions ahead of time and I always got a speedy and warm response. When we asked for help they were very quick to give us it. they were chatty and - well - lovely! It's a little Parisian hotel in a typical old Parisian building, so you have to expect that the stairs will be rickety and the lift a bit small and shaky. I don't consider this something to complain about. The room was immaculate - and very clean. No weird hotel smells or anything. It was always immaculately cleaned when we arrived back in the evening. The comments about the shower are well founded, but we just learned to stick an extra towels down - a small price to pay. I reckon that unless you pay top dollar for a hotel, you'll find a few things that aren't quite right - that's life! We had a corner room (room 53). The room had two floor to ceiling windows with french doors and the bathroom had one so you could step out on the balcony - and get plenty of fresh air in the room. One thing I would say is that I could hear other people in other rooms although it was faint. The windows shut out the street noise really well. We did not go for the 13 EU breakfast because we didn't want to pay 13 EU each for breakfast! I suppose I did feel that the room was a bit pricey for what it was to then have to pay for breakfast. I guess it was about location though and it suited our budget/plans this time round. Our favourite place for a normal 'French breakfast' (bread, croissant, jam and coffee) was Cafe Au Soufflot at the top of Rue Soufflot in front of the Pantheon - a short walk from the hotel. We walked a lot around Paris - it is definitely a walkable city if you are reasonably fit - but the metro and RER lines are a ten minute walk from the hotel so everything is very accessible. The hotel recommended Le Berthaut (Rue Vallete) for dinner as had friends of ours. It's a five minute walk from the hotel and it is indeed lovely. Across from it you'll find ZigZag bar which is lively and hoaching with students, but really great. We loved stopping there for a night cap! I loved staying at this little hotel - I felt very welcomed and at home by the staff and loved our little room. The area is fun and lively - doesn't get too touristy until you get closer down to Notre Dame. One piece of advice: check if anything is happening at the Pantheon while you are there. Our last day coincided with a high profile event which included President Sarkozy being there, so all the streets leading up to the hotel and the Pantheon were closed. We had quite a time trying to get through to get our bags (tagged and in the luggage room) so we could leave for our flight. The hotel had issued us with a document and told us to have our passports with us - that this would get us through the security to the hotel during the event, but the Secret Service and Police wouldn't let us until we begged a Policeman who had us escorted to the hotel!!! This resulted in a mad rush to get to our flight. It was bad luck as we arrived just as Sarkozy arrived. Also, this was NOT the hotel's fault - just bad luck with timing... and, if I am honest, it was an adventure and I consider that all part of the package of travelling!

There are always people around since the university is just up the street. Good restaurants nearby. When you walk up the main road to the Pantheon - turn around and you can see the Eiffel Tower!

Got a great rate by doing an advance on-line booking. The hotel is gorgeous, really cute. its basically a very elegant town house, with the most amazing spiral staircase running through it. We were on the 5th floor and it was cool looking down the middle of the stair-well (easily amused!) The room was just gorgeous, beautifully decorated, rich sumptuous colours, cosy, spotlessly clean, plus small balcony overlooking the Pantheon. It was just stunning. We were only there for one night, but I will definitely return and recommend to others. We walked nearly everywhere. At the bottom of the street is the Jardin du luxembourg. Walk through the park and you arrive at Rue Bonaparte which is the start of St germain de Pres. Visit Pierre Herme on Rue Bonaparte, best macaroons in town. From here, walk straight down Rue Bonaparte and you will hit the river in about 5-10 mins (passing the magnificent church of Saint Sulpice on the way) and you'll then be opposite the Louvre. So you can walk easily to lots of great places. We jumped on Metro from here, although there is a Metro near the hotel, and a couple en route, if you don't fancy all that walking, so much cheaper than London! One more thing, there is a restaurant, le Comptoir du Pantheon, just by the hotel. We went on our arrival, as we'd missed lunch, it was about 3pm, we were starving and it was the first restaurant we hit, which can be a bad idea, but not this time. Go there. You would think it would be a tourist trap, but it is so not. Packed with Parisians, food out of this world, I had Duck with Sauteed potatoes, it was so delicious, my son had a burger, but it was a great burger.

This review is in regards to their poor customer service. My husband and I were set to go to Paris for 10 days last October and were very excited. We were also looking forward to staying at this hotel since people have said so many wonderful things about it. Unfortunately we had to cancel our entire trip to France because his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. She was going to watch our daughter during the trip but was required to start treatment right away. At the time of booking, they require you to pay in full for your hotel stay. They offer a 24 hour cancellation policy which was stated in their confirmation email. I am not disputing these terms. However, I was allowed to cancel my reservation through their web site and received confirmation via email of a credit. If you are not allowed to cancel a reservation, this hotel should not allow that option in their reservation system. Or at least they should provide a notice that the cancellation is not allowed. In this case, I received an email confirming my cancellation and credit so I assumed everything was fine. The hotel has said they will not provide a refund or even allow us to use the money for a future trip. So my advice to you is BUYER BEWARE. I was hoping that would make an exception due to the sad and unique circumstances of my cancellation.

The room was a reasonable size with a very nice bathroom and separate loo plus a safety deposit box and a television and minibar enclosed in cupboards so that the Louis XVI style was not spoiled by modern facilities. The colourful fabrics and exposed ceiling beams added to the ambience which was so different from some other 3-star Paris hotels. The room was surprisingly quiet considering its location and the traffic which died down during the evening. A lot of thought had gone into providing a comfortable room and a very modern bathroom and efficient heating/airconditioning system. The only extra we asked for was a blanket which was brought to our room whilst we enjoyed dinner at the nearby restaurant Le Berthoud in rue Valette (recommended by the receptionist) which offered two courses for 17 euro and had a mix of local people as well as tourists. We had the buffet breakfast in the renovated cellar for 11 euro per person which was good value for money as it included a well-presented choice of hot drink, cereals, juice, fruit, yoghurt, bread, jams, pastries, cheese, ham and a pancake hotplate.

At 130 Euros, this was exceptionally good value for a Paris hotel. The posted room rate was 270 Euros, and that would have been excessive. For the money, you get a cozy (read: small) well furnished room with either a Place de Pantheon view or an inner courtyard view. The former is full or Parisian charm to the hilt (waking up to a view of the Pantheon dome in the sunlight is definitely a high point of any trip), but you'll have some street noise. The courtyard-facing rooms will afford and guarantee and uninterrupted night's sleep. The rooms, though small, are equipped with a mini-bar, a safe, flat-screen tv, and clock-radio/telephone. The bathrooms are spotless and proportionally large, and the showers feature both over-head and hand-held attachment. Water pressure was excellent and hot water was steady. Welcome was warm and efficient - we were checked in within 2 minutes and the desk staff all speak excellent english, though we conducted our transactions in french. An airport shuttle service is also offered at 17 euros/pp, though paying 16 euros to the desk staff in advance, and the remaining 18 euros to the driver means that when you hand him a 20 euro note at the airport, he is guaranteed 'not to have 2 euros' change. A rather sneaky manner to pocket an extra tip, though certainly not something the hotel controls. There are several boulangeries just a short walk away behind the hotel, so breakfast options abound. As well, you'll not be stuck for dinner options; walk in any direction and there are dozens of lovely restaurants - check reviews for the area. One that I can personally recommend is Perraudin, just a 2 minute walk away. Overall, a pleasant little Parisian hotel, close to much the Rive Gauche offers (Jardins du Luxembourg, Rue Saint-Germaine, etc.) but do try for a discounted rate, especially in the off seasons. Paying full rate for the room would just leave you jaded.

However, we could have asked for a better location since we didn't feel central to the sights we wanted to see, but that is not the fault of the hotel, and besides, we weren't that far away anyway. The relatively close location and the quality of the hotel itself mean that I would definitely recommend this hotel, especially to anyone looking to visit Paris at a good value!", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Binghamton, New York", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice\u201d", "Author": "BTMNSP", "ReviewID": "UR79213524", "Content": "This is a great location - nice property.

Very cute, Parisian feel. Quiet, comfortable beds and great air conditioning. Would stay again! I stayed for four nights with my teenage daughter in July. We had a very small room (#25) which is to be expected in Europe with only an internal courtyard view which mainly consisted of the air conditioning unit and other buildings although a view downward showed the tiny courtyard patio of the hotel. However, we spent very little time in the room and I purposely selected not to pay for a room with a view. I knew from experience that we would spend the vast majority of our time in the city - especially in the summertime when it is light out till well past 9pm! The room was lovely with fabric covered walls in a quaint, french provincial style: colorful prints, white painted dollhouse sized furniture and lovely painted beams across the ceiling. My daughter loved the room and I am now fending off requests to remodel her bedroom at home to look just like this hotel room - fabric walls, furniture, beams and all! The bathroom was also small but very clean, modern and well appointed. Common to almost all European hotel rooms I've been in recently (which is many) is a small glass panel that only extends about 1/4 of the length of the tub to block water from the shower (no shower curtain or full glass door). This is a bit troublesome as water poured down the glass panel and underneath this panel and drenched our floor every time we used the shower. The poor maid must gather a lot of sopping wet towels from each room every morning. A nice touch though was the etching of the Pantheon on the glass panel. Be prepared for a tiny TV and I mean tiny - maybe 12 inch - smaller than my laptop screen. No modern flat panels here - but again - you don't come to Paris to stay in the room and watch TV. The hotel did have free wireless internet but it was an extremely slow connection but enough to check emails and verify a flight online - with some patience. Also the lift is claustrophobic (again common to hotels that are in original buildings in the heart of the city). The winding staircase is the best bet for reaching your room. We were only on the second floor so it was an easy climb for us but rooms on the 6th floor might be a bit of a workout! We did not avail ourselves of the breakfast - there are so many great cafes where a croissant and cappuccino is so much less that it just didn't seem to make sense to spend money on the hotel breakfast. we did venture down to view the breakfast room - it seemed like a great breakfast and nicely appointed - even rather bright for a little cave room. We found a cute little muffin place on Rue Soufflot that had delicious homemade muffins with fresh pressed orange juice - delicious! The best part of this hotel is it's location. It has fantastic views of the Pantheon and the Luxembourg gardens which are just down the street are stunning. We spent many an hour lounging there and people watching - get a sandwich from the vendor across the street and enjoy a little picnic here. There is discount shopping on Rue Saint-Jacques and you can walk easily to most major Parisian sites (Notre Dame is very close). The Latin quarter is lively and in the heart of Paris. The metro is steps away - we actually took the RER stop which is just down Rue Sofflot and to the left and connected from there to all other Metro lines quite easily and it was a breeze to find the hotel from the RER from Charles De Gaulle airport. I highly recommend searching out Cluny Square (stroll down Rue St. Jacques and when you hit the metro at Boulevard St. Germain cross the street and enter the quaint cobblestone walkway to a great pedestrian only area with souvenir shops and tons of restaurants with some great fixed price menus of appetizer, meal and dessert. Also wonderful was Rue Mouffetard. Here you will find a great mix of restaurants of various cuisines (Greek, Parisian, Japanese, Lebanese, etc) mixed with some very cute Boulangeries and shops. To summarize - a cute hotel with a real Parisian flair, a great location, a quiet night's rest (not easy to find in the heart of the city) and air conditioning that worked!

The hotel is situated in the square in front of the Pantheon in the Latin Quarter (5th arrondissement). It is a charming and stylish place. The rooms (I saw 4 altogether, numbers 10, 22, 34 and 64) are relatively large by Paris standards, quiet, beautifully appointed and well-airconditioned. Some have views of the Pantheon; others of the internal courtyard or adjacent street. The staff are extremely obliging and helpful. I mention in particular M Hicham who not only changed but upgraded my room at no extra cost when I found that the shower didn't function properly. The area around the hotel is very lively, and I would recommend that one spends less time in the Rue Soufflot in preference to the smaller and more interesting streets at the back and around the sides of the Pantheon, especially those leading to the Rue Monge which are less touristed. Lovely restaurants and cafes in the area in addition to the most charming Luxembourg Gardens. Breakfasts freely available outside the hotel if you wish. The closest metro is Cardinal Lemoine, and the RER station, Luxembourg (with trains direct to both Orly and C de Gaul airports) is also nearby. The best news is that Parisians seem now finally to have conceded that they are also members of the human race after all; a very kind man in a bar spontaneously offered to assist me with my map; English is no longer frowned upon, and even a pathetic effort at speaking some French will attract not entirely cynical smiles. This hotel presents a worthy challenge to those in the Marais (eg the Duo, the Beaumarchais, the St Merry and the de la Bretonnaire), where I have usually stayed in the past, to get their act together .... Just one very minor quibble: the hotel recommends and arranges the \"Nice Shuttle Service\" which we took for the return trip in preference to shlepping luggage to the RER station. Be clear and adhere to the terms of payment as agreed. The driver (not employed by the hotel as far as I know) is a rather graceless man who claimed that we had agreed to E34 when in fact it was E17. I was quite happy in the end to pay E34, and did so, but that was not the arrangement as per the hotel desk. This criticism should certainly not affect your opinion of the hotel at all.

The air conditioning actually worked. The mini bar was a standard dorm-style refrigerator so it was possible to keep additional cold drinks inside, if desired. Breakfast was typical of French tradition and quite sufficient. Most importantly, the staff were very pleasant, helpful and good English speakers. The biggest negative for me was the inconsistency of wireless Internet - it varied room-to-room and floor-to-floor.

It is also close to an RER station, so travel almost anywhere in the city is quite easy. There are also plenty of shops and cafes close by.

In any case, I spent 5 nights in March and another night just two days ago and love this hotel so much. Many of the other reviews highlight the plusses and 'not so plusses,' and I will briefly do the same. First off, fantastic location. Close to everything I want and like in Paris, accessible to Metro and RER, great restos and cafes in the neighborhood, just great. Desk staff is consistently friendly and helpful. This year, Emilie, Carine and Christophe were at the desk and couldn't have been more polite, professional and kind. The food service staff that brought hot water for tea in the AM, and the cleaning ladies were also friendly and cheerful. This kind of service goes a long way and makes you feel happy to be staying at the hotel. Rooms are lovely, cosy, spotlessly clean and very well maintained. The Pantheon view rooms are, for me, perfect; you feel quite special to have such grand views just out the windows. If you have a lot of luggage, space might be tight. To me, however, this is charming and, as a single traveler, doesn't really bother me. The building is an older one; as such, you understand that the elevator is small, the rooms can be small, and there may be small noises traveling between walls. Again, to me, this is part and parcel of staying in a smaller, older hotel. I would add that over the years, updates and renovations have been made to keep things fresh and up-to-date. Suggestions? I did notice that the mattress in my room the other night was a bit soft; of course, every mattress is different, and I did not notice this at all in the room I had for 5 nights in March. I cannot think of anything else, actually - and suppose this is why I love this hotel so much. If you're looking for a well-located, small, charming hotel that's spotlessly clean and staffed by friendly and helpful people, this is the hotel for you.

It is located right next to the Panth\u00e9on. The closest metro stations are Luxembourg (RER) or, on a different line, Maubert Mutualit\u00e9. Both stations are within a five- to ten-minute walk from the hotel. The area feels safe and is never deserted, no matter what time of night or day. There are a number of little restaurants nearby, many of them frequented by Sorbonne students. Rue Mouffetard is really close as well, and another good place to find numerous restaurants (some better than others) and little shops. H\u00f4tel du Panth\u00e9on is adjacent to another hotel (H\u00f4tel des Grands Hommes), owned by the same group of hotels.The area is calm, and our room was extremely peaceful. We had asked for a quiet room, and our wish was granted. Our room, number 64, had a view of a little courtyard on one side and of a little street that runs along the side of the hotel on the other. This was actually a wonderful feature and I should elaborate: When we arrived in our room, we saw the nice bed, the warm decor, and a little armoire that was adequately sized to hold enough clothes for a period of 8 days for 2 people. We were not expecting a huge room, since this is Paris, and it was not a huge room, but it was just fine. It was cozy and lovely, and very comfortable. From the window in the bedroom, we could see roof tops, a little courtyard, and even part of the dome of the Panth\u00e9on. There was a safe in the room, and a TV that had a built-in alarm clock which we did not discover immediately. A door in the bedroom led to a pretty spacious bathroom, rather elegant, that was equipped with a large sink, a tub with shower (not the kind in which you have to kneel in the tub and \u201chose\u201d yourself! The tub actually had three knobs: one to use the shower head attached to the wall, one to use the \u201chose\u201d if so desired, and one to fill the tub), and a toilet. The other amenities were a hairdryer and a towel warmer. The toiletries were nice and the towels fluffy. At the end of the bathroom was a large window that amost reached the floor. When we opened it, we were delighted to discover a small balcony with plants, geraniums in bloom, and a little round table with two chairs. From there, we could see the Sacr\u00e9 Coeur. It was lovely, and although we did not use it as we could have, had we stayed in this hotel in the warmer season, we still liked opening it every morning to enjoy the fresh air and the lovely view. Our room and bathroom were impeccably clean. The sheets were not changed every day, but probably every other day. Some evenings we found candy on our bed, other nights, we did not. Some days, our toiletries were replenished, other days, they were not. It did not really matter. What mattered was that the room was clean and pleasant, the bed comfortable, the hotel pretty and convenient, and the employees friendly and helpful. It is nice to see a friendly smile in the morning, and it never failed when we walked by the front desk. One of the gentlemen at the front desk reserved a shuttle for our trip back to the airport, and that worked out very well. The driver was on time, and we arrived in Charles de Gaulle in less than an hour, despite three stops to pick up other customers. If you decide to use the shuttle, make sure you reserve a few days in advance. I cannot comment on breakfast, as my husband and I decided to make other arrangements. All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel. Next time we come to Paris, I fully intend to stay there again. If anyone working for the hotel is reading this, I thank you for making our stay (a late 50th birthday celebration) very pleasant. This is a well-run hotel with friendly and qualified employees.

They will quickly recognize you if you stay a few nights. They are customer oriented in a way I did not expect in Paris. Eating well is not a problem. A ridiculous selection of independent restaurants are 5 min walk to the east on Rue Descartes. More conventional cafes to the west towards the RER Luxembourg station. If you have the option, don't include the breakfast, but get it the days you want it. It is worth the price (13 euro) compared to eating at cafes. It is simple but fresh, and you self serve, getting just the food you want. However, some mornings you will be moving fast to beat the lines at some tourist site, so you will miss breakfast. As a side note, the neighboring hotel, \"Hotel Gran Homme\", is the same management. In short, easily a place I would stay again, especially for the price we got. Price matters, but assuming prices change with the season everywhere, I don't think you will find many places better, and lots of places that are worse for the money.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wakefield", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel but nothing special\u201d", "Author": "NoLeakHere", "ReviewID": "UR52463310", "Content": "The hotel is in agood location, about 10 mins from the Luxembourg RER station which make the trip from the airport easy.

The lady at reception was the friendliest and warmest French person we ever met! (some French staff can be very cold and brusque, particularly if you speak English). She was the honourable exception. Her English was excellent and she immediately made us feel at home. We booked 'superior' room which means, I think, a room at the front of the hotel looking directly onto the Pantheon. I think the non superior rooms look onto a quiet sidestreet. That\u2019s just my guess. Luxembourg Metro station is only about a 10 minute (albeit up hill) walk, and the RER B takes you directly from CDG Airport in about 30 mins. The room was nice but small, but all hotel rooms in Paris are small. We have stayed in smaller rooms than this, e.g. Hotel Cluny Sorbonne which is nearby. It was perfectly adequate for us. We had a magnificent view from our window..out onto the Pantheon and beyond that we could also see over the roof tops, Sacre Coeur church. At night it was a stunning view. The bathroom and toilet were very clean, but the flow from the shower was more of a dribble than a flow. However we were on the 6th floor so the pressure may be better lower down. But the flow (as my wife pointed out) was more then enough to wash what's left of my receding hair. There was also a hand held telephone shower unit which appeared to have much better pressure. Traffic noise, even though fronting onto the road was barely discernable. But maybe on a lower floor it may be a bit louder? Someone pointed out paper thin walls and hearing people talking in next room. Every hotel I stayed in Paris is like that. Most (in the older centre Paris area) are converted from a prior domestic or commercial use and a lot of walls are partition walls. That's the nature of these types of old hotels in Paris. However we slept soundly each night. If you are a light sleeper (as I am) bring your earplugs with you, and you won't hear a thing. Overall the hotel and the surrounding area was extremely quiet, which we like. It has a very limited public sitting area on the ground floor and no bar as such. You can order a drink at reception, and they will whistle one up for you from somewhere! So there are no large public sitting areas or in house bar, if you are looking for that type of thing. However there is a lovely local bar/restaurant behind the hotel which was very pleasant to sit in and have a drink or tea/coffee. Out the front door, turn left..up to junction and left again..just after the Pizza joint. This bar seemed to be heavily populated by locals, which is always a good sign. But it tends to close up ship shortly after 10.00 pm. Obviously believers in early to bed and all that. Overall I can highly recommend this hotel to people who want a good location, friendly staff, and a great view (superior room) and who are not looking for a large lobby area, with sofas, bar etc. We are already planning on returning in May.

We were extremely happy with our choice of hotel. It was like a quiet oasis in the middle of the busy city. The square, while filled with tourists coming to the Pantheon during the day, was very calm and quiet at night. We had booked a room with a view over the Pantheon and when we arrived we got room 50, with a little balcony, from where it was lovely to people watch. All the things other reviewers have said are true: the room was smallish, but not impossibly so; the shower screen over the bath did not prevent the floor from getting soaked. But it was beautifully decorated and the bed was big and comfortable. Most importantly, it was very clean. Room 50 is right beside the lift but the noise from the lift was not intrusive. It was a lovely room to come back to after a busy day of sightseeing. Although we never needed to ask the reception staff for help, they were all very friendly and we did hear other departing guests thank them for their assistance with various matters. They have a luggage room, where we were able to leave our baggage upon checkout until it was time to catch our evening flight home. The only negative I can think of was breakfast. We had booked the room only and at 13 Euros it was quite expensive for what was on offer. There was orange or grapefruit juice; choice of hot drink; croissants and what the French call \u201cviennoiseries\u201d; bread and jams; yoghurt, some cold meats and cheese. They also served a little dish of fruit salad. This may sound like a lot but the fruit salad was in some kind of sweet syrup, which we did not like, and the croissants were slightly stodgy. Also, the breakfast room was in the basement \u2013 obviously no windows. For 6 Euros 50 we had a really lovely breakfast at the nearest cafe on Rue Soufflot, just round the corner \u2013 the Comptoir du Pantheon. We had orange juice, choice of hot drink, tartines and croissant or pain au chocolat. Both the croissant and pain au chocolat were bigger and much lighter/flakier than at the hotel and since the weather was absolutely gorgeous while we were there, it was great to sit outside breakfasting in the sunshine, with the Pantheon on one\u2019s right and a view of the Eiffel Tower to one\u2019s left. This hotel is conveniently situated for cafes on Rue Soufflot, or just a little farther away at the Sorbonne square. Five minutes walking takes you to Rue Mouffetard, where there are lots of restaurants. You are not too much further away from the St Germain area, which seemed to have plenty of eating places to choose from. It was easy walking to Sainte Chapelle, Ile de la Cite and Ile St Louis and not that much further to the Louvre. We enjoyed the Jardin du Luxembourg at the bottom of the street. We also liked the fact that the hotel was so near the Luxembourg RER station \u2013 very handy for the train to and from CDG and also for connecting with the metro to get about the city. We would love to stay at this hotel in future. Its central but quiet situation is great and we really liked our room.

We got a great rate via the hotel website becasue we were staying in August and so it was excellent value! We were in Room 52, with a balcony - not big enough to sit on but we could stand on it with our drinks, and sit with the tall windows open in our room looking outside. It was decorated in pretty pale blue, with fabric covered walls and white wooden roof beams. Everything was spotlessly clean. Of course the room is a little on the small size but we'd expect that anyway and have stayed in smaller ones in London in higher starred hotels. The view of the Pantheon is amazing, yet it is such a quiet spot to be. Convenient to walk down to to most of the places you want to visit, we never used the metro once, and only got one taxi when we were very tired! We ate all our evening meals within 5 minutes walk of the hotel too. Sitting in the one of the bars on the street leading from the Pantheon, Rue Soufflot, on an evening with a drink, you can see the Pantheon to your right, and the twinkling light show of the Eiffel Tower to your left - wonderful! The only negative point for us was that although there was room service for continental breakfast there did not appear to be room service for coffee/tea - and so on an early morning that was not good for us! However, if we had taken our own travel kettle this would not have been a problem, and it was our fault we forgot it. Also, one night we decided to have the half bottle of champagne from the minibar, and there were no flutes, and we had to go downstairs for them ourselves (quite a way, and not good when you're already ready for bed!). But these are very minor points, and I only mention them so that you are forearmed and can prevent them! The service at Reception was inpeccable, very helpful and friendly. Very highly recommended, and when we go back to Paris again in 18 months we are already wondering where on earth we could stay to get such an excellent combination of things, even though our budget will stretch a to something more expensive then.", "Date": "August 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cWonderful, romantic, great value Paris hotel.

It is a wonderful little hotel and in a brilliant position so close to St Germaine area and the Luxemburg gardens. I trusted trip advisor comments in booking this hotel and I can honestly say it was the best decision of our honeymoon (so far!). We stayed in room 61 on the top floor with a great view of the pantheon in a beautiful red wall papered room. The room itself was well appointed and of average size for Paris with lovely little touch's and a clean and new bathroom. The room is well designed with a separate bathroom and toilette and lovingly decorated. I ordered flowers through the hotel and they were beautiful and well worth it (and lived the entire week!) The area is great for well priced food, walks in the park, and basically having a wonderful Paris experience. We took the metro and taxi's (about 12 euro to Montemarte, 10 Euro to arc de triomph etc) so if you are travelling as a group cabs work out better than the metro. I also really appreciated the free wifi... a big tick given the cost in most hotels these days....I could say so much more but I think the best thing to do is trust people's opinions on here and just book it. We will be back, in room 61, I just don't know when!! As for the local area there are some great little coffee shops for breakfast so we decided against the hotel breakfast. I enjoy sitting outside in the morning and watching Paris go by too much. The pick of the bunch is the first cafe on the left hand side as you walk down from the hotel to the gardens (cafe ? du pantheon) with great salads and cafe food, and the three cafes in the sorbonne square (a short walk away).", "Date": "August 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California, USA", "Title": "\u201cA winner!\u201d", "Author": "SusieQTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR36964794", "Content": "I really enjoyed staying at this hotel - charming French ambiance.

It is about a 15 euro taxi ride from Gare du Nord (the Eurostar station) or an easy trip on the RER.

This hotel stood out mainly for it cost, location and I have to admit, we just liked the look of it on their web page. The hotel is located in the Latin Quarter, directly opposite the Pantheon, therefore very straightforward to find. We caught the RER train into Paris from Charles de Gaulle airport, and got off at Luxembourg, which is a five minute walk away from the hotel. We arrived at the hotel at about 11pm, and we were concerned as we hadn't told the hotel we would be arriving late. However, this wasn't a problem and the staff were welcoming. Our room was no. 45 and situated on the fourth floor, overlooking the back of the hotel. So, no view of the Pantheon but it meant that the room was incredibly quiet. We liked the room and thought it was everything a Parisien hotel should be - nicely decorated and furnished - but probably not your cup of tea if you like modern and cutting edge design. The room isn't huge but it is more than adequate for a city break. No tea and coffee making facilities but not sure if that is the norm in French hotels anyway. The bedroom and en-suite bathroom were spotlessly clean. You can have breakfast in the hotel but we didn't bother as there are plenty of places nearby. The nearst metro is Clunny, which is about a 10 to 15 minute walk away down Rue St Jacques, where it intersects Boulevard St Germain - again there are lots of places to have breakfast, coffee, etc around here.

So here they are: The good: 1- Outstanding location. Close to the Metro, the Pantheon as well as many small mom and pops type of restaurants. 2- Nice reception area. Renovated and has a beautiful front lobby that acquainted us while waiting for a cab. 3- Priced reasonably at least 20 to 50 Euros below other comparable hotels. The bad: 1- Very small rooms. The rooms didn't fit our luggage. Every inch of this room is utilized by a bed, a night stand or a hallway to that leads to the bathroom and the front door. The bathroom is split into two segments, a toilet on the left hand of the hallway and the shower on the right hand of the hallway. Even the toilet room did not fit me trying to close the door. I had to step along the narrow side of the toilet in order for me to be able to close the toilet door. 2- Management attitude. The day we arrived, we asked the receptionist for additional towels and the receptionist responded by \u201cI am not sure if I can get you some\u201d. I then later informed him that I had a baby and thus I am in need of at least an additional towel he then stated that he\u2019ll see what I can do and brought few afterwards. On our second day, feeling the Jet Lag coming from San Francisco, we had to take a noon nap. The Hotel Staff kept continuously knocking on the door and sometimes forcefully entering the room while we were sleeping. We were so knocked out, we didn\u2019t even care. When we woke up, we simply asked for some towels since we didn\u2019t get ours replaced and the lady busted out impolitely blaming us for not opening the door for the cleaning staff. We simply had to hang up the phone and just continued using their previous day\u2019s towels. The hotel has one elevator that was out at least two of the four days we stayed there. The stairs to the rooms are very narrow. We had a baby on a stroller but the staff seeing my wife going down the narrow stairs didn\u2019t even care about the safety of the baby or bothered to help her out. See also item 4 about the elevator. 3- Breakfast was reasonably priced at 12 Euros per person but it wasn\u2019t worth the money. We ended up eating at the local caf\u00e9 down the street. 4- As indicated above the Elevator was down two of the four days we were there. We hopped on it on one of those days \u201cwith a baby\u201d and once it got to the fourth floor, it started skidding down. The repair service person was there to fix it afterwards but I am not sure why would they even have that thing up and running if it was skidding down. I had stayed in small hotels like this where the rooms were small or some facilities weren\u2019t working at their best but I think most importantly, management attitude is really what makes a difference in your judgment about how great a place is or not. Management, even on a smaller level such as asking for directions wasn\u2019t very responsive. I think if I knew that by saving those 20 to 50 Euros a day would have avoided me the hassle of dealing with their ill trained management, I would have paid it.

The location was superb - a view of the Eiffel Tower from very near the front of the hotel and the Pantheon just a stone's throw away. The Luxembourg gardens just a block away! Great brasseries, bistros, a pharmacie, coffee shops, and a superb boulanger nearby. (The boulanger just half a block \"up\" from the hotel had outstanding baguettes, croissants and mouthwatering sandwiches and pastries, all for unbelievably low prices!

Very easy location on the left-bank for walking to many great Paris \"must-dos\" like rue St Germain, the Seine, etc. and, along with the 5-day metro/RER pass we each bought, Versailles, the airport, etc. were all easily accessible and cheap to get to. Due to its unique positioning near the Pantheon, the hotel's location was extremely quiet at night given its central Paris location! Wireless internet access was not working the week we were there but we were able to use our laptop in the lobby of the \"sister hotel\" - Hotel des Grands Hommes - next door, also an excellent hotel choice!

The Luxembourg RER stop is three blocks away (right next to McDonald's and just across the street from the Luxembourg Garden). To save some money getting to the hotel from CDG airport (if you don't have too many bags) just take the RER straight to Luxembourg - you don't even have to change trains. Also, within a stop or two on the RER you catch any number of metro lines and go anywhere in downtown Paris. Very convenient! Our room was small, but I understand this is typical of Paris. Nevertheless, it was pleasantly decorated and quite comfortable. The bed was nice, and the bathroom (across the hall from the toilet) was clean and adequate. The elevator is a bit rickety, and the front desk staff were a little aloof. However, when I asked for assistance they were always helpful. They arranged a shuttle to CDG that saved us some Euros on our way home. Restaurant tips: - Le Fetes Galant (other side of Pantheon and down the hill a block) is a great little restaurant staffed by two people. Follow the servers recommendations and you won't go wrong. - Polidor (a few blocks away) is very casual and bohemian, and the beef bourguignon was terrific. - Le Relais de l'Entrecote (two locations) for delicious steak and fries - Le Bon Marche grocery (38, rue de S\u00e8vres) is beyond belief, and the pastries are the best!", "Date": "June 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Valencia", "Title": "\u201cVery cosy and good value for money\u201d", "Author": "ValenciaSp", "ReviewID": "UR7857522", "Content": "It is the third time that I stay at this hotel.

Charming hotel. Worth the value. Check out their rates on their web site. I found the best rates that way. Reserve well in advance (2 months, if possible). My wife and I stayed for 2 weeks in room 62 (top floor, corner room). Beautiful view. You can order a chilled bottle of champagne to be in your room upon your arrival. A nice way to start the party. Had a WONDERFUL time in Paris. Fell in love with the people, the culture, the beauty and charm of the city. It is special. (HINT: For those who are not familiar with the culture, customs and habits of the French, it is highly recommended that you learn to start each, any, every and all contacts with any French citizen with \"BON JOUR MADAM / MONSIEUR\" [or bon soir, during the evening]. It is considered very rude not to do this and will be considered an affront to the person with whom you are trying to communicate. They will then treat you with disdain, as if you have insulted them personally, which you have. [This is why some Americans beleive the French to be 'rude', when in fact, it is a reaction towards our bad manners, due to our lack of knowledge as to their customs and habits]. Greeting others in this way is essential. This includes all hotel staff including the maids, and when dining, the waiters, who are PROFESSIONALS (at least, most of them are) and should be treated accordingly. If you do not speak French [as I do not] then learn the phrase: \"No parlez vous Francais. Parlez vous Anglais?\". People will be very helpful if you at minimum give an attempt at speaking their language. There is much to learn, and if you do your homework, you'll have a FANTASTIC time. The hotel room is generally small, but not too small. This was expected, so not a problem. Nice view of Le Pantheon (be SURE to go in and explore), and in the distance, Sacre Couer. Everything was in working order; the room was clean and well maintained. Staff was generally helpful and always polite (especially Michael and Christian on the night staff). There is an elevator (very small but it worked) that gets you upstairs. Be sure to bring an electrical converter for laptops, etc. The hotel has wireless and it is at no cost. Neighborhood was excellent. Some restaurants within walking distance were very good. Make reservations for Les Papilles at 30 Rue Gay Lussac about four blocks from the hotel. And a small bar for locals that was beyond belief, where on Saturday nights, a wonderful French woman singer/accordian player played and sang old French songs, locals danced, drank, sang, etc. The bar is just down the street from Egliese St. Etienne (the 13th Century church with Gothic exterior, gargoyles, and AMAZING wooden rood in the interior...kind of a mini-Notre Dame...check it out...it is beautiful). The church is on the other side of Le Pantheon (kitty-corner from the hotel). Morning time, you can walk to the Mouffetard district (about five blocks away) or walk down to Deli's Cafe (down Rue Soufllot towards Blvd. St-Michael) where you can get espresso and croissant, etc. for a reasonable price. Anywhere else, you are paying a LOT for breakfast. I suggest you save your money for lunch, which is THE meal of the day in Paris. One restaurant for the evening that I can recommend: Le Reminet at 3 Rue Des Grands-Degres (have the staff print out a map for you as it is a very small street on the Left Bank just off the Seine, and just to the east of Notre Dame). Ask to be seated in the downstairs room. Very romantic and intimate setting. The hotel staff can call to make reservations for you (recommended). Try the desert of the small cake from Bourgogne with the honey ice cream, almond milk and carmalized apricots. Anything this good should be illegal. Learn to use the Metro to get around town. Do a lot of walking. Museums, shopping, eating, drink the French wine, go on day trips to Versailles, or Giverney. Go to jazz clubs. The Flea Market was a trip. We were lucky enough to catch a Roger Waters (Pink Floyd) concert while we were in town. It rocked. Next trip: to the South of France, Provence, Cote D'Azour. Bring plenty of money.

This selection alone was succesful, because when using much the RER-train , metro or bus, Gare du Nord would have been terrible. When we found Hotel du Pantheon with exceptionally positive and numerous Tripadvisor reviews, we were sold. The price to quality value was good. The location is excelent, even on foot to many places we wanted to visit. Although centrally situated, practically no traffic noise could be heard, as the local main streets are a few blocks away.

We were very pleasently surprised by the reception we received on arrival, the facilitiesand the room. We had booked a standard room through Venere.com at 325 euros for the three nights. The room was bigger than all the warnings had led us to expect and beautifully presented. There was little perceptible noise at any time beyond the background hum of the heating unit and our room looked out onto a side street; what little noise came up was stopped by the double glazed windows. Our only criticisms would be the lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the room, and we would have referred the temperature to be significantly lower. Neither of these issues detracted from the enjoyment of our stay and we would be very happy to stay here again. We did not have breafast in the hotel, preffering to try or luck at local boulangeries (gernerally OK). We travelled to Paris by Eurostar (a mixed blessing!) and bought a three day Metro ticket in advance. This gave us our only real problem of our trip as the tickest let us onto the Metro, but would not let us out at the other end. To be stuck behind a reluctant barrier with assorted pieces of luggage at the end of a lengthy jouney was not fun. We had to be rescued by other travellers who passed their tickets back to us to use, and the following day our dud tickets were exchanged at the Metro station. (You only see staff on the way in!)

And the hotel personal were way more friendly than most French experiences I have had. I am an American living in Berlin so I get to travel a lot. Some of the prices posted in the other reviews were way too expensive however.

The choices available were fairly limited. There was yogurt, cheese, pastry (croissant and baguette), dry cereal, sliced meat, and a bowl of chopped fruit. Juices available were OJ and grapefruit.

We just wanted a pretty Parisian hotel near the Latin Quarter (I'd heard it was good for restaurants) and near the sites so we could be touristy. This was definitely it. As you walk up from the Metro station you can see the Pantheon (which is such a fantastic and imposing building) in front, and the Eiffel Tower behind. It's an easy walk to the Seine, the Islands, the Louvre and Notre Dame (all 10 mins) and a slightly more adventurous walk from the Eiffel Tower or the Arc de T. (don't try and do it using the map in the back of the Time Out guide). It was really clean, with helpful friendly staff who spoke English AND happily put up with my broken French when I inflicted it on them. Our room was a cheapie, looking onto a very cute side street. Lovely bathroom with a good powerful shower and small but perfectly formed rooms with very comfy, quite soft beds. We didn't eat there because, you know, we were in Paris - there were far to many beautiful places to have breakfast to waste meals in hotels. This certainly isn't a luxury but for it's price range it's really good value and really lovely. Definitely highly recommend. Two tips: 1. Book through there own website, which does special offers much cheaper than the usual 'hotel-finding' websites 2.

We arrived very late (after midnight - snow and fog had semi-closed CDG), but were disinclined to go straight to bed. The desk staff helpfully recommended a couple of possible bars (one turned out to be an 'English' bar, the Bombadier. We didn't go in...) and we ended up in the charming 'Methode' which was still open when we left at 2am. The Pantheon's Staff did speak English, but a little hesitantly. This was more than compensated for by their willingness to understand our 'school' French without difficulty! We had 'ordinary' rooms (i.e. not facing the Pantheon) but my partner and I were in one with a four-poster and lovely view to the side street (no street noise, however. Great double-glazing). My mum had the adjoining room (as requested when booking) which was twin, with lovely print (cloth) on the walls. Both rooms (which looked very like the 2 pictured in the brochure the Hotel sent us) were on 3rd floor (lift is tiny - only takes 3 people, or 2 plus substantial baggage). We heard no noise from other rooms, though my mum, whose room was by the (very elegant) staircase, said she could hear kids running on it whilst dressing for dinner one evening. Rooms small but spotlessly clean (heating was a little clackety if turned up too high, but actually we found the rooms very snug even with heating at 12-15 degrees C), ditto bathrooms (very characterful taps, good shower pressure, but one evening the water wouldn't run hot for a bath). One light bulb blew, but was replaced the following morning. All bed linen and towels etc. were replaced daily. Mini-bar was fairly priced (and the fridge was useful for storing champagne for New Year's Eve). Breakfast seemed pricey, so on the recommendation of a friend who knew the Hotel, we didn't sample it. There are loads of little cafes around, where one can have the coffee+croissant thing propping up a zinc bar (streets to the NE of the Pantheon teem with bars and cafes; ). The RER stop 'Luxembourg' is only a 5 minute walk, and definitely the sensible way to travel to/from Roissy CDG. For dinner locally, definitely go to L'Ecurie (Rue Laplace) - the E15 menu has the best beef I've ever had, lean and succulent, and the cheapness of the food encourages splashing out on the wine, which is well worth it. Various nice 'extras' in the way of aperitifs and calvados also came our way.

Returned to Paris from a road-trip for another 3 nights and had requested a courtyard room due to the noise on the Pantheon side. We were given Room 15 (don't ever take that room) which faced the hotel air conditioning unit and a wall....it was very warm in Paris last week, 86 degrees F but they refused to turn on the air conditioning. We didn't get any ventilation with the windows open because of the wall but instead were up all night staring at the air conditioner we wish was on!

I requested another room the next day and was moved to room 43 which was better but faced the Pantheon again.....noise, noise and more noise all night long. There is a restaurant up the street and people eating, drinking and talking into the week hours of the morning. Europeans eat later than Americans so the dinner crowd arrives around 9 pm and doesn't leave until around 4 p.m. By then they have had so much to drink they just make a lot of noise walking past the hotel. And the scooters buzzing by all night. To make matters worse you can't even think about going back to the room to rest and regroup for awhile late afternoon because there is hotel renovations going on and hammering from morning until late afternoon....just no peace and quiet.
