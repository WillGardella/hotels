Shortly after, Helmsley Park Lane website were offering the same for 50% discount ... thems the breaks, we still got a good deal. Upon arrival, the check-in person couldnt find our booking. I was prepared for this as this is apparently what happens when you book thru Expedia according to Expedia reviews. I was offered a double suite overlooking the city, I refused the offer as we had booked and paid 6 months in advance for a King Suite over looking Central Park and had a copy of the booking. The person suggested that just because thats what we requested, doesnt mean thats what we would get. I was prepared to stand my ground and the point was argued for several minutes, including an offer of a corner studio room overlooking Central park for an additional $50 per night. They ended up finding our booking and surprise, surprise ........... we got our King Suite overlooking Central Park. It was well worth the argument. The room was clean, something out of the sixties, needing a major upgrade. The shower head was permanently pointing at the ground and would not stay up, and the wall paper in the bathroom was coming away. Having said that, it was comfortable and clean and spacious and and I quite liked it .... was a bit like staying at an old relative's house. I guess if the owners threw a pile of money at it to renovate it up to todays standards that it would have cost a whole lot more to stay there than we paid. The hotel is right on Central Park south, with Central Park West (Broadway and Dakota Building) to your left and Central Park East (Fifth Avenue) to your right looking out of the window across Central Park. And Central Park in all its glory right onyour doorstep, and it really is just fantastic! The staff were generally aloof and disinterested in us and most people coming and going. There were no greetings upon arrival or departure, no door openings, no smiles, no acknowledgements of your existence ........... nothing. We were there for 6 nights, so I feel that we have some qualification in this respect. We have travelled quite a lot and I have never experienced a hotel where the all of the staff treated you like you had interrupted their day when you had a question or were more interested in their discussions with each other to do the job they are paid to do. Then they expect a tip. Very very disappointing. Breakfast was interesting, you must register your room number when you arrive and if you get there at the optimum time (8.00am to 10.30am), there is a 20 to 30 minute wait. The staff do not offer tea or coffee (remember we stayed for 6 nights) you must chase the staff and ask for assistance, and even then they look down upon you. After a couple of days we didnt bother going even though it was included in our booking as we were over the same old fruit, crouissants and bagels and bad service. And no free wifi ....... But then, location location location. While they have the location and price, I guess they believe that they dont need the extras that good hotels offer, ie customer service, wifi and breakfast with variety and a smile. If there was a next time, I would stay somewhere near Hells Kitchen, so many great eating places and friendlier people around that area.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "carolynpruett", "ReviewID": "UR126802262", "Content": "Nice hotel right across from Central Park.

Hairdryer was such poor quality it barely dried my hair (which is very short). My room overlooked the next door building bt was very quiet. I slept very well. Service was also old and tired with a few exceptions such as the super maitre d'hotel in the restaurant who cheerfully seats the throngs that line up for breakfast after 9 AM with aplomb. The table I was show to still had crumbs, half used butter and milk on it from the previous guests and was not removed durig the whole time I sat there., I had to constantly ask the waiters for water refills and to stock fruit and other missing items from the buffet.

Free breakfast buffet includes Danish and fruits. If you want cereal, eggs, porridge, etc. you pay a surcharge. They have an excellent 24 hour gym with state of the art equipment.

But for several hundred dollars a night - and the rate is in the $350 to $550 per night range - one deserves a much higher caliber of service and sophistication than this hotel can deliver. The biggest impediment to fine service here is poor training of the staff. Never have I seen such a sorry bunch of ill trained people in any business, hospitality or not. Enter the hotel and you see security guards and bell hops chit chatting among themselves instead of greeting the guests with the expected, \"Hello, welcome to Helmsley.\" The reservation clerk keeps humming a tune while processing your reservation like some motel clerk in a fleabag motel. Missing is the cigarette dangling from his mouth or a wad of gum inside his mouth. He then callously tosses the room cards towards you instead of politely handing you the cards. In the restaurant, which by the way has an entire glass wall overlooking the lush green vista of Central Park, the maitre d' pours himself a glass of juice from the breakfast buffet and then proceeds to sip on it while calling out names of guests in the line and getting them seated. I have never seen a maitre d' or hostess even at a diner drinking anything while at the station. But this is pretty much the \"atmosphere\" of the place at all times. It seems they have hired a bunch of people and just pressed them into service without teaching them the basic rules of the hotel business. The room itself was spacious and properly decorated with period furniture, but again, the poor training of the staff was evident as there were no drink glasses in the room, only in the bathroom. Who would feel comfortable using bathroom glasses, unwrapped ones at that, for a drink in the room? As stated before, the location is fantastic but there are other hotels in this rate bracket that deliver a good location with much more ambience and style.

The Helmsley Park Lane is a very nice hotel in a fantastic location. It is next to Central Park (South) and has very easy links to anywhere in the City. There is a tube station next to the hotel as well as bus tops (including the stop for sightseeing tours). The horse and carriages that do tours of the park are also on the same road as the hotel. If you don't want to use public transport then you can just walk straight down 5th Avenue. Our room was great, we had a huge (very comfortable) bed, a nice bathroom (with good shower) and lots of storage space. I had asked for a park view room (if possible) when booking it but we didn't get one which was disappointing as it was a special treat for my fiancee's 30th birthday. To be fair they did offer us an upgrade when we checked in but at $100 per night we couldn't afford it unfortunately. The only downside to this hotel is the prices of extras. We booked as a package with American Sky so got a good deal on the room rates, however the cost of breakfast and the bar was completely unrealistic. We only had one drink in the bar as we didn't realise how expensive it was until after we had asked for the bill. The mini bar is the same, we often fancied a drink whilst getting ready but at those prices we waited until we were out. Don't let this put you off though. It is a great hotel in a brilliant location and it's surrounded by some of the most famous (and most expensive) hotels in NYC. The extras are therefore expensive for a reason, but just be careful.

We had booked the Junior Executive Suite with another adjoining room on one of the Executive Floors at a 50% discount. I believe the normal rate for this arrangement is well-over $1,000 per night. This gave us two bedrooms with a king size bed each, a large living room, three full bathrooms and six closets. Hence, space was not a problem for us. We were on the 36th floor with one bedroom and the living room looking out directly onto Central Park while the second bedroom looked out onto 58th. The view of Central Park was absolutely worth the price. One can see north to the park, the Upper East and Upper West sides very clearly. We found the rooms to be very spacious, the king-sized beds and the one roll-away bed ($35 dollars extra per night) to be very new and comfortable. The furniture was dated but clean and in good repair. The bathrooms were dated but very functional and clean. The toiletries supplied by the hotel was Gilchrist and Soames. The towels were not the \"fluffiest\" and one did have a hole on it -- this is an issue that other reviewers have pointed out. Being on the Executive Floor had some perks. These were: Continental Breakfast for 2 included each day (value of about $40 total each day), 2 drinks at Harry's Bar (value of about $40 total per day; the price of drinks at the hotel is high). The breakfast could be eaten at either the one restaurant on the 2nd floor or in your room via room service. Service was just fine (I would rate it 7 out of 10). If you are expecting a Four Seasons level of customer service then you will be disappointed. The fitness facility was sizeable with an array of Cybex machines, some free weights, one Smith machine, two treadmills, one stationary bike and one step climber. However, we found it could have used a cleaning. The Park Lane is close to the following subway lines: N, Q and R - entrance on 59th just east of the hotel; A, B, C, E, 1, 2 and 3 at Columbus Circle and further East the number 6 near Lexington and 59th. We would definitely stay at this hotel in the future but couldn't imagine paying the full price for the rooms.

The reservations agents seemed to think this was a ridiculous request and, I think, made no effort whatsoever to honor it. We checked in at 1.30 and neither room was available (which was OK with a scheduled 3pm check in). In fact our second room didn't become available until after 6pm. The check-in desk is a weak spot in the hotel. A couple of agents (Tom and an eastern European accented woman) were pleasant and helpful in mid-afternoon but by evening it was being run by the rejects from Fawlty Towers! Frustrated travelers were being given rooms with no cribs, no connecting doors and no whatever else they requested. This wasn't too serious for my family with teenagers but a very upset French family were being given a \"fabulous King suite\" (with one bed) instead of the interconnecting rooms with four beds total that they had requested. The father was nearly in tears after a transatlantic flight with three children under age 9. It seems very odd in view of the fact that both of the rooms we eventually got had connecting doors (locked, thankfully!) to other rooms. And the staff clearly couldn't have cared less. The hotel is nice in a 1990s way. It's comfortable and the beds were good. I paid $40 more for a Central Park View suite (just a slightly bigger room) and it was more recently decorated than the \"double double\" which was still quite good for the kids. Continental breakfast was included in this package deal and was served in our rooms which was lovely. We could have gone to the dining room but we had our own lovely view of Central Park from the 9th and 10th floors.

The staff at breakfast were inattentive and slow, they only had to sort the tea and coffee orders and for two days out of the four we stayed the drinks order had to be chased, thank god the view was good I had to organise to post a parcel back to UK and asked at reception to borrow a pair of scissors only to be refused !!!

I may have gotten lucky, but I did not find my room nor the hotel as a whole in the state of disrepair described in some reviews. My biggest complaint was probably the poor quality of the gym, but they probably count on the committed athletes using Central Park right across the street. When it rains, as it did for my stay, I would recommend trying one of the core fusion or yoga classes at the nearby Exhale Spa.

Lately when she has to stay in NYC, they put her up at the Helmsley Park Lane, right off Central Park. If you get the right rooms, it has a lovely view of Central Park right out of the movies - and while the current room service menu is EXTREMELY limited (a single laminated tabloid-sized front&back sheet), the food when you get it is generally warm and quite tasty. As with most NYC hotels and restaurants, service staff expect to be tipped fairly generously (we generally give $2/bag to the bellman, $3 to the doorman, $5/night to the housekeeping staff, and round up the room service meal charge to the nearest $5) - but we've always found the staff to be helpful and attentive, and many of them even remember us by name. However, you can tell it's a luxury hotel because they charge you for everything in the room from Internet ($15/night!) to bottled water ($4 for a small bottle!), and there's no coffeemaker in any room or mini-fridge in most rooms. Food from room service is also expensive - if you can get away with paying less than $40/person for breakfast including coffee and juice (the one meal we usually eat in our rooms), count yourself lucky. The paid hotel Internet is really abysmal even by the category's generally poor standards - the last few visits, we've given up and used a mobile Internet hotspot from our cell phone provider. Most of the people you see in the lobby or Harry's Bar are either wealthy senior citizens or well-to-do foreign families clearly on holiday.

Staff OK, check-in took an unusual long time but everything else went smoothly and without major problems.

I want to like this hotel, but their front desk staff and customer service make it really hard. The views of the park are exquisite. I would only recommend this hotel if you can get a park view, if you can\u2019t save yourself the trouble and book at a hotel near the park like the Empire Hotel or the Waldorf Astoria. Their rooms here are large, especially by Manhattan standards, with full bathrooms. These are other pluses. I am unsure if the lack of customer service is simply a result of poor training and management or booking with priceline (though I have never had a problem booking with them before). Whatever the reason, this hotel seemed to have that dismissive tourist trap attitude towards customer service. I wonder how many repeat customers they throwaway this way. A front desk blunder turned into a debacle due to the significant lack of quality customer service. I realize front desks make mistakes, I\u2019m not sure that I find it acceptable in the technology age to print off keys to an already booked room and deactivate the current room holder\u2019s keys. And there is certainly nothing tolerable about having your mother walked in on as she is changing for dinner. In a situation such as this, I cannot understand how one\u2019s front desk transfers that call to security and hands off the complaint without making sure that the complaint is heard and a solution found. It seems that the least management could do in this situation is to comp the room for that night. But from the moment I checked in until the moment I checked out, I received different information every time I had a question. Upon check-in, I was told that the hotel was completely out of double rooms. I could upgrade to one for $75/ night on an executive floor. After their blunder, management offered to comp our room and to switch us to another queen room if we felt unsafe. Several conversations later, a double room was offered for the rate we had booked the queen room. I assumed that this meant the rate we had booked at minus the rollaway since we no longer needed it. When we returned to the hotel after dinner to make the change we were told that we would need to wait until noon the next day. Minutes later, we were called and asked if we were planning on switching our room because they had a bellman waiting to take us. As we were moving to our new room, the bellman informed us that we were moving to a room with a park view that we should be very happy to get and that New York was a large city and that we needed to realize that it was expensive and that it could be dangerous so expecting things to be perfectly safe was completely unrealistic. While I appreciate his candor, I wasn\u2019t aware that his lecture series on the nature of urban existence in the 21st century was part of the room charge. Upon check out, I realized that they continued to charge us the rollaway charge the entire stay. The $35/ night rollaway fee became a $35/ night upgrade fee for the park view. My assumption had been incorrect, but I wasn\u2019t the only person confused by what was meant by the room rate. Management seemed confused too, because the night they comped the room rate they still charged us the $35 fee. The management would have found a very devoted repeat customer if on Saturday night they had offered the solution of one night compensation and a move to a double room with a view of the park for rate of the room and the roll-away fee. I would have been overjoyed. Instead I was surprised and frankly annoyed by the bill when I got it. I had to ask about the conflicting information rather than the staff making sure there was no confusion. It was in congruence in service that makes it unlikely that I will stay there again and certain I will never recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh PA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel fantastic touristy location.\u201d", "Author": "JDP527", "ReviewID": "UR119122604", "Content": "Don't hesitate this hotel is clean, big rooms, and great location.

I was surprised how noisy it was late at night from the traffic going passed Central Park - but I suppose it's the busiest City in the world. Apart from that, the room was superb. Very spacious which I've not experienced in mid-priced hotel rooms in NYC on previous trips. Bed was really comfortable. The bathroom was great with a walk in shower that was really good. We didn't use any of the hotel facilities (i.e bar/restaurant/fitness room) because New York City was on the doorstep! The great thing about the hotel is that it is in walking distance from some really good sites and the subway. We felt really safe and there were plenty of really good places to drink and eat nearby. Would definetely stay again - especially considering that they had some good deals for this hotel on the internet.

For business, there is ample closet space, a desk, and a decent, well-lit bathroom. ROOM SERVICE: Like most hotels in NYC, the extras can add up, but it's a good value for the price. I needed room service before an early meeting, and it was definitely more expensive than going to a bagel shop, but convenient. CHECK-IN/OUT: The check-in area is a little cramped and chaotic. My room wasn't ready when I arrived at 1pm, but they were able to hold my luggage. I arrived back to the hotel after a day of meetings and my room key didn't work either, and then it took two tries before I got the correct room key.

Our bathroom grout was pretty disgusting. Our room was otherwise very clean. Unfortunately, I didn't discover this fact until after we had unpacked and settled in, so it would have been too much of a pain to switch rooms. Because of that, we didn't complain, so I don't fault the management for failing to rectify the issue. I DO, however, fault them for creating the situation in the first place. If housekeeping didn't know about it, they should have. If the house manager didn't know, he/she should have. This wasn't something that happened over a few days. This had to have happened over a long period of time. So if the people responsible don't care about the cleanliness of the room, why would they care if I had complained? Also, the front of house staff was less than friendly, with the exception of the bellmen. The bellmen were very friendly and helpful. The front desk staff was efficient but terse, and on check out actually asked my husband, \"What do you want?\" The concierge was no better. He was an older gentleman who I never saw crack a smile. I went to him to print out our boarding passes for our flight home. While waiting in line behind another customer, an employee patrolling the lobby asked if he could help me. I told him what I needed and he said I could either wait for the concierge or go up to the business center where there would be a charge. I thanked him and stayed in line. When it was my turn, the concierge told me that I needed to go up to the business center. I told him what the other man had said and his reply was, \"Well, you'd have to have all your flight information with you for me to do that.\" I said it was on my phone and pulled it up. He proceeded to take two phone calls and did some filing while I waited with my information. He eventually entered my info and printed the boarding passes. Still no smile. I've stayed here 3 or 4 times and for me it's all about the central location and the view. However, if this is your \"big once in a lifetime trip to New York\" I would look elsewhere. If you really need the help of the concierge, expect good service and want a well-maintained room then this hotel isn't for you.

When we arrived in our cab, a doorman named 'Nana' (tall black male) got our bags out of the cab in which I tipped him for and he SNATCHED the cash out of my hand. I was a little drawn back from that experience and shrugged it off. We went to check in and were greeted with an unenthusiastic girl (forget her name) who tried upgrading us for $75 a night (We were staying well over a week so obviously this was way too costly). We declined. She was not very helpful or nice and from then, I felt a little dissapointed. She then called 'Nana' the same doorman that one minute prior had carried out luggage from the cab and instructed him to take us to our room. Upon arriving, we walked in and he put our bags in. He stood there for a few seconds when I looked at him he said \"AREN'T YOU GOING TO PAY ME?\" in a very aggressive tone. I understand that they work on tips and this is common but considering I had already tipped him I said \"no, I have already given you money.' He then proceeded to tell me \"NO!!!!!, that was for me getting your bags out of the cab, you now need to pay extra because I took them into your room.\" I wanted to argue with him about because I knew he was trying to take advantage of me because I was foreign but he was towering over me so I just gave him a dollar to get out of my room. I was disgusted that a hotel that boasts about their standard would employ somebody so rude who would try and intimidate their guests!! DEFINITELY NOT LIKE THE MOVIES. The room was TINY but probably huge due to New York standards as they are known for their shoebox sized rooms. It was clean (found a lot of hair in the bathroom) and the bed was very comfortable. The noise was a little bit of a problem and there was no privacy if you had your window open. We had a \"city view\" however, should be renamed \"wall view\" as we were facing apartments and had people staring at us if we ever opened the blinds. Location was amazing, right across the road from Central Park, nearly next door to the famous Plaza Hotel and a walk away from 5th avenue. Wifi was expensive but you could walk down 1 minute down the street and pick up free apple store wifi. If you are a first time New York visitor, I would probably recommend staying a little closer to Times Square because that is where the action is and where all the tours leave etc I would maybe consider coming back if they SACK that door man NANA.

When we refused and asked for a regular taxi the doorman told the taxi driver that he should also charge us 90 dollars or more. The taxi driver then tried to make us pay a flat fee of 100 dollars but we told him that we shall complain and basically scared him with few more comments. We finally payed a little bit more than 60 dollars. While it was not pleasant to finish our vacation in New York which such an experience we finally laughed at this. You certainly would not expect stuff in a hotel charging regular rooms 390 dollars/night and more to behave like that.

We had dinner reservations for Saturday night and tickets to a matinee performance and brunch on Sunday. We chose the Park Lane because it was the ideal location and a special occasion. When we arrived at 3PM the room felt very hot, but we were anxious to go out and enjoy the afternoon. We came back at 5ish and lowered the thermostat but it kept jumping back up to a higher temp. We called maintenance and they said they would send someone up. Instead of being able to relax before we went out for the night, we waited and waited but no one ever came. We figured that it would be taken care of while we were out. We came back around 11PM and the room still was boiling hot. My husband spoke to someone in engineering who suggested that we open the windows( guess you have to be an engineer to think of that) or change rooms(at 11PM!) He mentioned to my husband that the room we were in (3516) was hot because the heat ran through the closet wall in the 16 line(. If the thermostat work ed that would not have been a problem.) I filled out a room comment card and handed it in to the front desk. Our express check out had been processed so they did not offer to adjust the bill in any way to make up for our uncomfortble night in the room.The woman at the front desk gave me her card along with an appology and said that the next time we came back she would give us a room upgrade! About a week later I received a letter of appology from the resident manager assuring me that the \"problem\" had been addressed and that it was going to be handled in an \"expeditious manner\" He told me how much he valued me as a customer, and he too invited me back to\" restore my confidence\"...unfortunately, he is expecting me to foot the bill for him to do that! If you look at their website, you will notice that the word \"service\" is mentioned several times, however, as you can see from this review we never got to experience it! A good restaurant will bend over backwards to fix something to assure that you come back again, which often includes a bill adjustment, a dessert, something.

That night I came back quite late from my meetings (around 9:30pm), I asked for the number of my new room and both the lady who took care of me at reception and the manager looked quite doubtful (it looked like if nobody knew or had made the change for me). After waiting for too long (it was already 10pm or so), I was taken to my new room, which was actually, if anything, the same quality as the previous one; but not getting the type of room I was supposed to get was not a big deal at that moment. It was quite late, I had an important meeting early the following morning and I just wanted to go to bed. My biggest (and horrendous surprise) came when I went to the bathroom and opened up the toilet seat. If you take a look at the photographs I have posted, you will see the new surprise I got, but this time so much worse than before (I do not need being a doctor to know that the previous guest had diarrhea...). I immediately called reception to ask for a change of room and I even started calling other hotels, as this was already too much. But the unbelievable attitude of the manager in duty (not a single \"I am really sorry\") would make my night even harder: it took him more than one hour before he changed me to another room. The lady at reception had better manners than the manager (although it should be the opposite, I guess). She apologized several times and promised they would do everything possible to make sure I will have a nice time for the rest of my stay, but she actually didn\u2019t deliver: she left her shift without resolving the issue, leaving me waiting in the room, and I would not get a new one until around 11:30. I finally got a third room (three rooms in three nights), where I did not have any further bad surprise, but what definitely struck me was that neither the manager on duty in my first night, nor the one in my second night nor the one on duty in the morning when I checked out clearly apologized for what had happened (they seemed not to bother!). One of them expressed a shy \u201csorry\u201d, and the one on duty the day I checked out actually did not even apologize (!) In summary, the quality of the managers\u2019 manners in this hotel is definitely comparable to the cleanliness of its bathrooms. I believe the hotel senior management would do themselves a big favor if they reconsider the quality of the management they hire for key positions going forward.", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carmel, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful room, perfect location, incredible bed and comforter\u201d", "Author": "indyslf", "ReviewID": "UR88003051", "Content": "I slept like a baby here, which is saying something, because I typically have difficulty with noise or light in most hotels. The down comforter may have helped. It was incredible; reminded me very much of the comforters I love so much in Germany. The room was furnished in an older, upscale Victorian manner. (I think it's Victorian; am not a designer.) The dressers had lots of curled ornamentation, for instance. It felt like a room from a posh, older hotel in Europe. I enjoyed the peace and quite very much. Even the lobby was very sedate. The location is the best: right on the park, almost right next door to a discreet subway entrance. (You have to look for it; it won't jump out at you; at least it didn't for me.) I used the business center a couple of times, and it was very nice. The business center allows people to print out airline boarding tickets for free, which I thought was pretty decent. I had to pay, however, because I used the center for work; I can't remember the price, but it was negligible--about $9 for checking and responding to email, printing out a map, etc. I also enjoyed Sarabeth's next door. I love their breakfasts and enjoyed sitting on the patio looking out at the park. Probably because of the location, the Park Lane's regular rates are very steep. I was in New York for business, though, so received a discounted, corporate price of $270 a night. I don't think I would be able to afford the regular price, which I believe is closer to $400 or $500. For $270, you can't do better in Manhattan.

Going for it this hotel, it is in a very good location sitting right opposite Central Park. Getting around is very easy.

If I were to buy an apartment with this view, I would have spent several million dollars - perhaps that justifies the ridiculous room rate at the hotel. The Park Lane's lobby is nothing terribly noteworthy. When I was in the elevator bank, I heard the desk attendant yelling at someone on the phone about the need to speak English, which seems a bit odd for a hotel of this caliber. Perhaps a more friendly approach or (gasp) a multilingual staff would help. Not to berate the staff, though, because everyone was very friendly to me (I guess I speak English?). For example, the concierge quickly suggested and made reservations at a nearby restaurant when we asked for help. My room on the 38th floor was adequate in decor. Furniture is sort of mid-80s luxury - lots of gilt, flouncy chairs and prints. Kind of like a suburban raised ranch owned by your great aunt. Of course, for the price of this room, couldn't they afford to update? The towels and sheets are wonderful, though, and the bed was quite comfortable. This is an \"executive floor\" which not only gives you a high floor, but internet access with your printed chairs. The in-room service made me conclude that the Park Lane is actually inhabited by magic fairies - use a towel, and suddenly a new one appears. Turn your back, and suddenly your slippers are placed beside your bed upon a small mat with the words \"good morning\" written on it. How did they do that? I never once saw a housekeeper in the hall - how did they get to my room? The hotel provided free continental breakfast in the dining room, which was nice, but didn't really rival a Holiday Inn Express in terms of quality. Similary, dinner at the hotel was...OK...but not great. Once again, the view was nice but the pricey chicken breast was nothing but that. The conference facilities are shameful. Really. Dreary, dusty looking rooms with giant mirrors(!) in the shape of interlaced diamond patterns (!) hanging on the wall and strange mid 80's chandeliers do not say \"luxury hotel\". On the upside, the food at the conference was better than the dining room. An odd final note - cabs seemed unaware that the Park Lane exists.

We were given a \"group rate\" which was still over $250 a night. On the first trip, I had to drug myself to sleep because you could hear the doors slamming all night long, which jolts you out of bed, very inconvienent for any professional or person that would like to enjoy sleep for more than 2 hours prior to beginning their next day. On the second trip, I begged the woman at the front desk to put me in a room where i could not hear the slamming because I was pregnant and could not take medication to aid my sleep. This apparently meant put me in one of their \"unrenovated\" rooms which are anywhere from floors 19 or below. After a a night of training and supervision, i came to the room exhausted and cold, took a bath and went to bed...the slamming was just as loud, but i was determined to sleep. I removed the extra blanket from the closet to add to the bed because the room was freezing and the heat did not work. As i was wainting for maintenece, I looked down to notice the beige blanket was covered in dried urine (funny that it was folded and placed in the closet as clean). I ripped it off the bed and called housekeeping. They replaced it ,apologized and i went to bed. After 2 hours of lying awake listening to the doors slamming, my legs began to itch, over and over, I noticed a red rash appearing but i figured it could be from my stress and ignored it and went to bed. I woke up covered in bed bug bites, which my dermatologist confirmed following my return home the next day. The hotel denyed it and claimed to investigate it that day (this was not done and probably has never been done, 3 weeks later after an email describing my dissatisfaction with my stay did they claimed to do it). They comped my night of hell and when I expressed my dissatisfaction and belief that I should not be charged for the 2nd night of stay they refused. This hotel is aware of their bed bug infestation and is doing nothing to prevent it or compensate their guests. The costs following my return home including ($200 of dry cleaning everything and $100 for my doc and creams) this was ridiculous and costs more than the room! This hotel is horrible, they offered a free night in the future, obviously they think i am a masochist! You could not pay me to return there! I truely can not conceive of how this hotel is part of the leading hotels of the world, I have stayed at many, as this hotel is below a sleazy motel's standards! Please take my advice, I know I am a stranger, but I know nice hotels, and I actually worked at a hotel on south beach, Fl. during my doctorate training and I know what a hotel should be and this is by far the worst by any standard! My bill was over $600 for 2 nights not including all of the money that it cost me to cure the bed bug bite infestation and prevent it from being transferred it into my home. I don't care if this hotel only cost you $25, it is not worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Trust me if you get a \"deal\" you are getting the unrenovated rooms--Beware!!!)

The hotel was better than I expected, though it is dated. First of all, the location on Central Park South is excellent. Besides the vicinity to Central Park, there is a subway station (N,R lines) a few feet away. Fifth Avenue is right around the corner. We did not have a park view room, but the view was fine and we weren\u2019t in the room much anyway. From the photos, the park views look to be nice. We had a king bed room and the bed was comfortable. The bed didn\u2019t have a comforter, though, which was odd. There was also no fitted sheet, but had a flat sheet tucked under the bed. From looking at other\u2019s travelers\u2019 photos, I\u2019m actually glad there was no comforter/bed spread. They look pretty old. There was central air which I prefer to box unit air conditioners. There was a flat screen TV on the wall and the room itself was spacious enough for 2 people by NYC standards. The bathroom is a bit dated and needs some work. The tub/shower needs to be regrouted, but appeared to be clean. Our cold water handle was stuck in the shower and I couldn\u2019t move it. Boyfriend was able to turn it, but barely and with a lot of difficulty. The shower also didn\u2019t drain well and you stood in a puddle of water while showering. However, I did let the hotel know about these two issues and they did send someone to fix the shower and those problems were resolved. The fuse also blew on two different occasions while I was blow drying my hair. They fixed this quickly on both occasions. The towels were nice, big and fluffy. There was turn-down service nightly which was nice. There was also a small refrigerator in the bathroom which was nice for keeping waters cold. They were doing some renovation work while there. You could hear the work going on on weekdays starting at 9am. There was a note in the room saying work would be done during work hours. Most tourists are out during those hours anyway I suppose.

Short walks to the east or west sides and great walks through the park. Third, several good resteraunts wihin a short walking distance for all levels of dining. Fourth service that is personable and WILL respond to special requests such as getting expedited room service if needed. Finally, a staff that is guest centric. We are greeted when we enter and exit the hotel and called by our last name. Last fall I has surgery at Sloan Kettering and chose to stay in the city at the Park Lane for my post op recovery. The Park Lane did everything to make that stay as comfortable as possible. To those who found their stay unpleasant a few suggestiuons 1. If you get an unclean room either have housekeping come immediately or ask for a room change. Ask the manager. They will accomodate. 2. For a room too close to the street where the noise is problamatec, ask for a higher room The Park Lane is over 40 stories tall. While the city view rooms are not as appealing as the Park view rooms for the view, they are much quiter as 58th street is much less busy that 59th. Finally, if you are uncertain ASK TO SEE THE ROOM BEFORE CHECKING IN! As you can tell, we very much like this hotel. I would and do recommend it to everyone.", "Date": "October 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cFilthiest hotel - needs to be renovated\u201d", "Author": "ssegal5", "ReviewID": "UR47017334", "Content": "This hotel is undoubtedly the dirtiest hotel I have ever stayed at anywhere in the world and needs a major facelift - if cleanliness matters then DO NOT STAY HERE.

The condition of the furniture was horrible. When we arrived there was a ring around the toilet. It remained when we left. There is no convenient outlet for plugging ones computer into, there was no pen in the room. None of the phone's buttons to contact to specific departments in the hotel worked. The television screen had permanent damage to it. On the plus side, your turn-down service was good and the staff was pleasant (although we had to wait quite a while to retrieve our checked luggage, the lobby employees seemed rather disorganized).

I meant to write this review right away when all my memories was much more fresh but time slips away and already an year has gone. I am italian, I've travelled all around Europe but this was my first time in the States. I've chosen this hotel partially based on the tripadvisor reviews but some of them wasn't so spectacular and that worried me a little. All my concerns vanished when I first set foot in the hotel's lobby. Then, after the elevator brought us to our 12th floor, and the room door opened it was nothing less than a revelation. The room was so big We could have play tennis in it. Our king size bed was extremely confortable but the best part was the view from the giant window, I'll back on this subject in a sec. The hotel is on the 59th street, between 5th and 6th avenue. That means that You're not just close to the center, You ARE the center. If your room is on the park side the view from the window is stunning. We could have spend all our 10 days just watching the park from the windows and they wouldn't wasted. I can only imagine how amazing the view can be from the rooms of the higher floors. The room was elegant old style (a part from the big LCD TV screen) and we liked that, the only little problem was to understand how to turn on and off the lamps, it took few minutes. The service was excellent, I could mention many things on this subject. Anyway we didn't have our breakfasts in the hotel, we preferred to eat here and there around the place, there is a lot of choice (and I love cheesecake!). First morning we went to Sarabeth, just few meters from the hotel. It was a nice one, but a bit expensive. As I said the position is the best You can have in the city. Of course the place is big big big, so You'll need to use the subway and there is a stop very close to the hotel within a minute walking distance. One warning that doesn't have to do with the hotel: Don't trust the photography store that claim they can give You amazing stuff with sensational discount (like 60% or 70% off....\"only for today!\" then You come back the day after and the sign is still there of course), there are quite a few of them around the place and they're absolute cheaters. Look for serious dealers, for example there is a B&H on the 9th avenue (between 34th and 35th street) which we found absolutely amazing. So, a dream stay in the most stunning place in the world, I just can't wait to come back and I already know I'll be back at the Helmsley Park Lane Hotel, I cannot think of better choice!", "Date": "August 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nailsea", "Title": "\u201cTop Notch in every way !\u201d", "Author": "glenmprice", "ReviewID": "UR38399268", "Content": "Several of us on a recent and first visit to New York picked this hotel purely on the basis of its location in New York.

I really appreciated the hours breakfast began at 7AM as I was taking an analyst class over the weekend as well as celebrating Valentine's Day with my boyfriend. He did decide to add more to his breakfast our second day and you can do so for an additional cost, although it was expensive! I agree the rooms and hallways are dated, but the rooms are spacious, clean and for additional cost you can upgrade to a suite for a more elegant room. I stayed at the Plaza steps away for work and the room was $850 a night, so I truly appreciate the location the value.

We decided to take the room, and move to a non-smoking floor the following morning. The reception staff seemed more interested in getting us to 'upgrade' than to get us the room that we had paid for! The room is large, decoration a little old, and in need of update. The wonderful part was the view out to central park. More hiccups ensued.

She told us the previous occupants only checked out at 4pm (which basically meant the person at reception had out and out lied to us), and housekeeping had not had the chance to clean the room! She offered us a double room instead. Hubby was pretty incensed at this time, and insisted that they sort this out. The manager was apologetic, and sorted out a room for us and gave us vouchers for complimentary continental breakfasts. When we arrived at the room, it was a park-view king room. So, why they insisted they didn't have a room ready for us, when they did, is anyone's guess. This time, all the appliances worked, and we were further up (level 38), with a marvellous view.

They also rang us at midnight to ask if we dined at the Garden Court cafe. We hadn't, and it woke us up. Very bizzare, and truly unwarranted. What saves this hotel is the location and the view. The view is truly marvellous, you can see the nearly the whole of Central Park from the 38th floor. It's next door to a subway stop, great for a morning stroll through Central Park, and 5th Ave is right around the block. The breakfast in the Park Room is again, nice for the view.

What a disappointment. The only hotel personnel who seemed to have any clue about how to do their jobs were the desk clerks and even they were not always up to the task having some difficulty using the computers. The doormen and bellhops stood around the lobby or in front of the doors, both revolving and swinging, and only once during our five day stay did they bother to even open the door let alone bother to get out of the way. The hotel itself has seen far better days with torn and worn carpeting, banged up walls and furniture and stained fixtures and broken tiles in the bath. This tawdriness was compounded by the very poor job the maid service did in cleaning the room. There was a half inch of dust under all of the furniture with legs where the maids had not bothered to vacuum for some time, and even though the maids came into the room every day the room was never clean. Hair dotted not just the bath but the floor and sink after they cleaned. I am not at all sure it was from either my husband or me. The toilet was simply disgusting with a brown ring that looked more like some youth hostel than a fine NYC hotel. We never got clean glasses in the bathroom and there was dust on most of the pictures and television. The bellhop said there was an iron and ironing board and an umbrella in every room and that was only partially right. There was an iron, no ironing board, and the umbrella had several broken ribs which became apparent on the day when the skies opened and the rain came plummeting down. The Helmsley touts itself as one of the world's finest hotels and we were certainly expecting a level of service comparable to hotels we have stayed in in Europe, but it just was not there.

I found the hotel staff very friendly and helpful and the room was cleaned twice a day. The decor of the place wasn't really to my taste (very floral and rather dated) and the room did not have any coffee or tea making facilities, but these are really just minor points. We only had dinner at the hotel once, and it was to a very good standard, but for a great breakfast do head next door to Sarabeths which has a great chioce or the many delis which are within close walking distance. Definitely the best thing about the hotel, however, is the location. Based directly opposite Central Park, and within walking distance of 5th avenue, the Empire State, the Rock and the major museums, it is perfect for a sight seeing trip. Highly recommended. PS.

We arrived from London very late or actually very early in the morning to find no one at the reception, it appeared closed \u2013 we had on booking stated we would arrive late, we even organised the airport transfer through the hotel so this should not have come as a surprise. We rang the bell and waited, and waited until eventually a grumpy person whom I assume was the receptionist checked us in. We then waited and waited for a bell boy to be summoned to take our bags. The same bags we had to carry ourselves out of the car and negotiate through a set of small revolving doors \u2013 this is not an easy task with 2 large suitcases. I had specifically asked at the time of booking for a room away from the elevator \u2013 ours was not only next to the elevator but also backed on to the elevator shaft. The mini bar (which bizarrely is kept in the bathroom) was empty, so we had to order a bottle of water from room service \u2013 which cost over $10 before tip! The room was a good size and the bathroom had a nice big bath tub. However I noticed shortly after our arrival I received electrical shocks from all the light switches and any metal fixtures & fittings. The d\u00e9cor throughout the hotel is incredibly kitsch and dated, but to be fair this would never have been my first choice of hotel \u2013 it was booked by my parents for a family weekend away together. Unfortunately my parents request for a room with two Queen Beds had also been overlooked and they were given a room with 1 King. I understand that rooms overlooking the park have great views; unfortunately ours was at the back of the hotel and overlooked the car park and an office block. Jet-lagged and tired after the late arrival we took breakfast at the hotel dining room on our first morning, an experience not to be repeated. We were expecting this to be served as advertised in the famous \u2018park room\u2019 however found this closed for refurbishment and breakfast was now served in what appeared to be a windowless conference room. The waiting staff had already started clear the buffet away (even though there were 40 min left until the end of service). The staff were incredibly rude and begrudgingly took our order. They then proceeded to hurry us to finish as they wanted to set up for lunch (at 11am). Luckily the next morning we found a very pleasant restaurant next door, Sara-Beth\u2019s that serves a great breakfast at a fraction of the cost with a smile! Reservations on Sunday would be recommended as it gets very busy for brunch with queues out the door. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this hotel, I can overlook the dated d\u00e9cor as that is a matter of taste \u2013 and this is not our usual style of hotel but rude service in a city that prides itself on attention to the customer is unforgivable.", "Date": "June 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cFabulous position and spectacular view\u201d", "Author": "NewYorkstheDBs", "ReviewID": "UR16536248", "Content": "The Helmsley Park Lane is perfectly located opposite the park and if you are lucky enough to be in a room a high floor ( we were on 43rd ) then the views of the park are incredible.

Our double/ double non-smoking room was huge, sufficiently clean, and quiet -- It's was just all SO horribly ugly!

Creepy cream-colored \"ornate\" dressers with edges rubbed with \"gold\"; floral bedspreads, with floral wallpaper that by no stretch of the imagination could be said to \"coordinate\"; lamps with \"ornate\" golden swans; mirrors on the hallway ceilings. (It reminded me a little of Binion's Horseshoe in downtown Las Vegas, which actually TRIES to look like an antique bordello) Even if all of it had been NEW, it would have been UGLY; but the fact that it was all so old and worn in addition to being ugly, cast the hotel in a creepy dim light. (Perhaps staying the weekend before Halloween tainted our perception -- We kept expecting to see Leona's ghost!) It is flat out amazing that a hotel can get away with not updating its decor, at least once every couple decades. The beds themselves were hard, and bedding was thin and scratchy.

I was encouraged by the attentive and friendly check-in staff and, aside from some construction work going on inside the lobby, we were off to a great start.

My room was large enough and high enough to get a good view, but was obviously aging and in need of a major upgrade. The wallpaper and paint were peeling away and the furnishings must have been grand...in their day. The bathroom was small, but with a large tub. However, it was shoddy and unkempt. The vanity was out of a bad 60's movie and the caulking around the tub was moldy and pealing. Even where things were \"repaired\" it seems that no attention at all was paid to detail. The repaired grout in the floor for instance, did not match the original. The bed was large and comfy, but not a \"Heavenly Bed\" by any means. Finally, the windows did not fully seal, so street noise and wind were easily heard. Now, this IS New York, so I didn't spend a great deal of time in my room, but when you are staying at a hotel with the famous Helmsley name, you expect a little more. This room was a little less.

Know that although many hotels in NYC suffer from very small rooms, the Helmsley is not one of them. They are huge by comparison. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely return in to the Park Lane again. P.S. They have a great exercise room compared to most, if you're into weight training rather than just aerobics. Several Cebex machines cover all major body groups.

The location and park views were, and remain, unmatched. I hadn't stayed there in twenty years when I came across a great price on TripAdvisor. Completely unlike me, because I had stayed there so often before, I booked the room before reading the reviews. Then I read the reviews and then I was concerned. But time was short and I decided to proceed. Some of the negative comments leave me baffled, for instance slow elevators and rude, indifferent staff. I was on the 29th floor and never had to wait for an elevator and they were extremely fast. All staff were friendly and helpful, well above average. Some complain about turn down service. Well I'm not in NYC to be in my room in the evening and love to return to a turned down bed. Simply leave a Do Not Disturb sign on your door if you object. But the Park Lane's turn down service is the best: bedding, chocolates, trash emptied, towels replenished, room tidied. What's not to like? What I do have to agree with is that the rooms are very much in need of an update. The furniture and decor make it like entering a time warp; in fact, nothing has changed since I was last there in 1986. It's sad that what should be one of the premier hotels in the city has been allowed to age so. Despite this, housekeeping did a superb job with what they have and my room and bathroom were immaculate. Also park rooms are quite spacious, although non park rooms are only average in size. So, if you want a super location, are fortunate to have a park view room, want a friendly, clean hotel and are willing to settle for out-of-date decor, then the Park Lane's a good choice.

I really wanted to stay here as it is central and has views of Central Park from some of the rooms. Having read the reviews I was somewhat hesitant in booking the room but thought, how bad can it be as I was only going to be there for two nights! Before I booked the room I thought I would ask the Park Lane to defend their hotel and give me some level of reassurance as to the state of the rooms. Despite emails to several people, including Mr Anoussis the general manager, I received absolutely no response. I made an assumption that the hotel staff could not make any assurances on the basis, they did not have any faith in their own hotel. This was a shame, but in such a litigious environment perhaps not so surprising. Regardless, I decided I would book the hotel. My opinion is this\u2026 On the minus side. The rooms are a bit dated, in fact think 1970s (\u2018Whatever Happened to The Likely Lads\u2019, Paisley print shirts with long wing collars\u2026 that kind of thing!) and you\u2019ll have an idea about the d\u00e9cor. Possibly kitsch, but that really depends upon your taste. Personally I was not bothered one way or the other. The bathroom, like the bedroom, was in need of a refurbishment (or at a minimum a good steam clean). There was a fridge in the bathroom, which is a nice touch, but not one we took advantage of. As I could not find an ice vending machine I made the assumption you needed to take ice from the fridge or call room service. Again, the room is very 1970s (purple wallpaper on the walls\u2026 and ceiling! Interesting but dated wall lights) and the fixtures are showing their age\u2026 except the hairdryer. In general, let me repeat, the room is dated and really deserves a remodel in my opinion! But then we have the positives. Ignoring the unanswered emails, I found the hotel employees to be pleasant, helpful and a real credit to the hotel. The room was of a good size, plenty of hanging space and drawers and in a nod to modernism there was an LCD TV on the wall. The safe was interesting too. Rather than the \u2018think of a number\u2019 type, it uses your credit card, simply swipe it through to lock and then use the same card to unlock. But there is one really great reason to stay here\u2026 the view. If you get a park view room the down sides fade into insignificance, well\u2026 they did for us. I spent an hour sitting on the window ledge looking over the park and reading the paper\u2026 didn\u2019t even notice the wallpaper behind me! And it is as pleasant at night as it is during the day. Right outside the door, you have 5th Avenue and its sensational array of shops. Or you can hop on a horse drawn carriage for a trip around the park, they park right outside the hotel\u2026 but can be a little pricey! So all in all, I recommend this hotel so long as you are looking for a sensational New York vista at a reasonable price and can live with dated but functional furnishings. Make sure you get a park view though! I guess it is also worth considering, if the hotel did refurbish\u2026 the clientele would foot the bill. The neighbouring hotels also offering views of Central Park (Ritz, Trump, Jumeriah) probably have better furnishings, same view but are in a very different price band. Also worth considering that with property prices still booming in Manhattan (regardless of what happens in the rest of the US) there is always the possibility Helmsley will take the same route as the Plaza just down the street which has closed as a hotel and is being converted to condominiums, starting around the $1m mark and going up\u2026 considerably.

I have traveled extensively, and have never been more disappointed, although the price was surprising low when I booked it. I guess I got what I paid for in the room, but the greatest disappointment was the complete lack of ethics by the management. After the bellman failed to get my wife's cosmetic & jewelry bag out of the trunk of the cab, which arrives on a dimly lit Central Park Ave S street, only the bellman had enough moral terpitude to admit the mistake. While he admitted it was his job to get the bags out of the cab before it sped away, the hotel manager quickly started to duck. His only face-to-face comment was \"How do we know the bag wasn't left at the airport?\" When the bag turned up at the local police precinct, turned in by the cab driver the next morning, then you would think the hotel management would recognize the malfeasance on its part. No, they just refused to meet with me, sending the chief of security (a former NYC beat cop) to meet with me and deny liability. I was assured a manager would contact me before checkout, but when the time came and no contact, the manager again ducked out and claimed to be 'on the phone.' (I could see him talking to staff in a side room.) I was only able to file a report and document my claim (all of the valuables (jewelry and makeup, etc,) were gone from the bag when it was turned in to police) after having a heated exchange with the head of security. If I weren't a lawyer, they might have intimidated me. Be prepared for a fight if you have any problems at this hotel.

It's cheap compared to the other nearby hotels like the Ritz, but there are reasons for that... The front desk people are not interested in being nice or helpful. I pre-requested a high-floor room. I reserved a park view room, and wanted one that was high. The front desk person said \"sure\" when I mentioned that, and then gave me 7th floor. I asked again, she told me the only other option was a no-park view, smoking, double-bed room. So I took my 7th floor room. It had what I would consider a partial park view, I could see the trees right across the street. As most the other reviews mention, the decor is hideouos. White floral upholstery. Purples and silvers for walls and carpet. I could see how if it was in good shape that some of it might look good. The walls I could tell WERE nice at one time.

It had to be re-booted apparently. I called for help, and was treated really rudely by the front desk. The tech person tried to reboot me remotely, and said to try again in a few minutes. So 20 minutes later the TV still didnt work. Called again, and they said theyd send someone up. He came 30 minutes later, to turn the power button on and off and leave before seeing if it worked or not, which it still didn't! All I could see was some sad poodle (Leona's?) image with lines flickering through it. So I gave up on tv and went to take a shower... So, I noticed the water wouldn't drain. The drain plug was broken shut. Had to call the front desk to be mistreated once again, and they sent up a person to fix it about 30 minutes later. No minibar, which was disappointing.

We were on the 30th floor with a city view which was OK, nothing special but at least it let plenty of light in! The maids were very polite and even left chocolates on our pillows when they turned them down. The decor was a bit scratched in the hallways from the bellboy trolleys but apart from that everything else was top-grade. I'd recommend using the 59th St subway stop - it's underneath The Plaza, two doors away so very convenient. Just remember to buy your metrocard before hand or you'll have to visit the vendor in 60th St to get your card. Also there's an entrance to the hotel on 58th St so don't forget it when you're walking back uptown - it saves your feet that extra half a block!", "Date": "October 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Randolph, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cLocation, Yes, but truly needs a makeover!\u201d", "Author": "toddtravels", "ReviewID": "UR4005522", "Content": "I had the pleasure of staying at the Park Lane about 20 years ago and \"not much has changed!\" And I mean NOT MUCH - not the decor or furnishings in the guest rooms, not the hotel's lobby, elevators or hallways! Clearly the hotel looks \"tired\" and is in need of a complete makeover to restore its luster of two decades ago. I had read reviews on Trip Advisor prior to booking the Park Lane and they were really 50/50. Given the hotel's awesome location, I decided to \"see for myself.\" Check-in was speedy and pleasant. I booked a Park View room on a high floor. Though the hotel has 48 floors, I was assigned a room on the 24th floor (OK - same view). Many of the reviews I had read mentioned items needing maintenance upon arrival and my room was no exception. The a/c was noisy and the sink faucet would not completely shut off. Add to these problems one stained pillowcase and the 1970's furnishings and I proceeded back to the front desk to ask for a room change. The front desk clerk convinced me that the maintenance dept. would resolve the plumbing, a/c & linen problem. I accepted this and I was pleased that upon our return after a short walk, all of the items were, in fact, resolved. My question, though: Why wouldn't housekeeping or maintenance simply maintain the rooms daily rather than waiting for guest to arrive and complain? The rest of the stay was pleasant. The king bed & pillows were sizeable and comfortable. The mini refrigerator in the bathroom and the in-room safe are both handy. The water pressure is excellent. The staff is OK. They seem to be worn out, just like the hotel. But no problems. They just seem to have little motivation. I am a member of the Leaders Club of the Leading Hotels of the World. I have had the pleasure of staying at many of the fine \"Leading\" hotels throughout the US and the world. Though the Park Lane is still carried on the list of \"Leading Hotels\" the distinction escapes me. It is far from what one would expect from a \"Leading Hotel\" and its publishers should reconsider the Park Lane's standing as such. Now the GOOD part: The location is unbeatable!!!

I have a theory that the concept is also is at work regarding NYC hotel rooms, with most hotel grades inflated by 1 star. In other words, a 4 star hotel would be considered equivalent to a 3 star hotel in another city; a 3 star equivalent to a 2 star and anything below that we probably don\u2019t want to talk about. If you looking for a one sentence summation of this hotel, it reminds me of a Hilton or a Sheraton, which to me are solid 3 star hotels. In another city, this hotel would be acceptable for a 1-3 night business stay, but not for a special occasion or if you have a need to impress clients. My wife and I stayed at the Helmsley Park Lane this past weekend for a little getaway, without our children. I have to say that the multiple reviews posted on this site were accurate. We chose the hotel based upon location and through Internet research, so we had an idea of what to expect. We paid a Christmas season price and at that level, do not think that the hotel represents a good value. We had a city view room, on the 42nd floor. The view was looking east and in the early morning sunlight was quite nice. Our room was clean and reasonably sized (for a room in NYC). The bed was comfortable and the sheets had a nice feel to them. The d\u00e9cor was dated and fraying around the edges; chipped paint on a few pieces of furniture and snares/loose threads on chair fabrics. It is ironic that people pay a premium price to purchase newly distressed furniture yet when this hotel renovates, you will likely be able to get real \u201cdistressed\u201d furniture for cents of the dollar. The bathroom was fine with hot water on demand and excellent water pressure. The towels were rough and thin however and could certainly stand to be replaced. One of my pet peeves regarding hotel rooms is the shower curtain. In most cases (Helmsley included), there is no way to secure the inner liner such that water does not end up on the floor. Our room was equipped with a flat screen TV. The remote control was weak so that you had to be within a few feet of the screen and directly in front for it to be effective. The picture was not very good either. Then again, the TV was on for a total of maybe 40min during our stay (checking the weather and making sure that nothing much had changed in the world). The heating/ac system was another matter entirely. Our room felt like an oven when we walked in. I turned the thermostat down to 50 and opened the widows (2 windows in our room could open ~6inches each). There was no way to turn off the heat. I called the front desk and was told that the heat had been turned on for the hotel, but they would see what they could do regarding our side of our floor. We went out to a late dinner and when we returned we noted no change in temperature. Oh Well\u2026. By the next morning, according to the thermostat thermometer, the temperature was ~77, where it stayed for the remainder of our visit. At the price we paid, it is simply unacceptable not to be able to regulate the temperature in your room. On the other hand, basic hotel service was excellent. We noted that the maid service cleaned rooms twice per day and that was a pleasant touch. Check in and Check out went smoothly and they were able to accommodate our request for a room with a view, on a high floor. The elevators were very fast and even though the hotel was almost completely booked, we never had to wait more than a minute or 2 for an elevator to arrive. We didn\u2019t try room service so cannot comment on that. It was nice to receive a copy of the NY Times each morning, instead of the generic USA Today or something like the Daily News.

We booked through expedia and the reception desk discreetly moved us out of the rooms we were to have had (2 twins - only ones available on the website), into 2 w/king beds and overlooking Central Park. I have traveled all over the world and was still amazed by the view. It was mystical in the early morning, twinkling in the evening, and I was out all day, so who knows how it was in broad daylight! Convenient location, helpful concierge. The furniture & bathroom showed wear (abraded upholstery, tub, etc.), but the room was huge and overall (the view has spoiled me for anywhere else!), it was even better than my usual favorite in NYC, the Sofitel. Also - we had the wine dinner (unlimited different wines) at Cite restaurant, which was great.", "Date": "May 8, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing stay - good location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1786683", "Content": "Loved NYC - but the hotel was the only real disapointment. The staff were indifferant and unattentive. The room had numerous problems. The water dripped continously in the tub.

We were given a lovely junior suite with amazing views of the park; the room was very spacious (one of the largest city hotel rooms I have ever stayed in) although the furniture looked better put together than it really was. The bed was enormous and comfortable; the bathroom was adequate, if nothing special, and there were plenty of towels. When I couldn't switch one of the lights off because the switch was broken it was fixed very quickly. Room lights were not controllable from the bed (except the immediate bedside lights) which is unusual in a refurbished hotel room. The lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the room lets it down but at least the fridge keeps the wine cold! I would certainly stay here again. It is rather strange that the check in/out desk should be so pathetically small; there are a lot of rooms in this hotel! The staff cope quite well though; and a bit of selective palm-greasing keeps the lobby staff on the look out to be helpful.", "Date": "April 7, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sumter, SC", "Title": "\u201cDream Vacation !\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1765261", "Content": "I stayed at the Park Lane for 4 nights, March 15-19, 2004. Upon arrival we were treated with much concern because my Mother had cut her leg on the Super Shuttle van. The bell captain, Tom, gave her ice (Bless him) and one of the managers helped get our room rush cleaned (really Bless him!). We had a park view room that was very spacious and had a great bathroom! The view was fantastic. The decor was fantastic. Everything worked and was clean. The door men, bellmen and waiters couldn't have been nicer to us and made us feel really at home. There was a snow storm and one evening rather than risking the weather we ate in the \"Room with a View\". What could be nicer than to look out into Central Park watching ths snow fall. Leona, Trouble and guests were dining next to us! The food was expensive, it was tasty, and it was a lot of fun on that special night. The waiter even cut up my daughters steak! The refigerator in the room is a great big plus. If you need anything just walk out the back door, onto 58th Street. There is a deli right next door (get your coffee there) and directly across the street is the nicest salon at the Wyndam Hotel. My daughter got an appointment for a french manicure within 3 hours of our arrival, great price and sweet staff there! You can also go to the corner and find everything else on 6th Ave. The 6th Ave. cafe has the best Belgian waffles with fresh strawberries. Across the street from it is a very nice drug store. There is also a deli called Rock and Roll where we bought the best black and white cookies (late at night -when they had just arrived), and next to it is a liquor store that has anything you need. The room was cleaned extremely well everyday and our beds always turned down. We also made a friend in Brian , bell captain, who always watched out for us as we came in and out. We thank him! We can't wait to make a reservation for our next visit, I will request the very same room!", "Date": "April 5, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Helmsley Park Lane", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d93579-Reviews-The_Helmsley_Park_Lane-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$269 - $607*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">36 Central Park South</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10019-1600</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514424", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/59/fd/59fdf43971e9992fd610d7a802bfd5849large.jpg"}}
