We had a room each and all were same high standard. They're small but definitely all you need. It was really cold when we visited at the beginning of February and the rooms had a nice temperature and everything was very good. The staff were very helpful, especially the owner with local bus info which made my mum very happy as she found all the steps in the Metro really hard. The only thing I would say is to bring your own toiletries as they only provided a couple of satchets of shower/shampoo in one. It's really good to find somewhere so affordable and nice in a city like Paris, I would definitely return and have already recommeded this hotel to friends.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cFor a 2* City break, this is spot on\u201d", "Author": "GavTravels", "ReviewID": "UR123546771", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel du Prince Eugene as part of a family Birthday excursion for 2 nights in Paris. This hotel catered perfectly for our needs being very well placed to Metro (5 mins straight walk to Nation station) and next to bars and shops selling everything we needed. The rooms are predictably small, but kept immaculately clean and designed with just enough space for convenience. Our party was separated across 3 floors and all had the same guest experience. Upon arrival the receptionist gained directions for travel to our dinner venue and generally service was good. Breakfast was exactly as expected with a selection of pastries, cold meats & cheese with a member of staff providing hot drinks. One minor niggle would be that our towel rail didn't come on overnight; other than this everything else was very positive.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oegstgeest, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cNice price, perfect base for a citytrip to Paris\u201d", "Author": "RvDelft", "ReviewID": "UR122454088", "Content": "We stayed for four nights and had a good time.

My very red single room (small double bed) was relatively small but luxurious compared to the broom cupboard I had just come from in London. The bed was comfortable although the pillows took a bit of getting used to, not bolsters just very flat European ones. The room was yet to be fully renovated with no inserts in the wardrobe doors but aside from allowing me to choose my clothes from the bed this was neither here nor there. The wall mounted tv didn't have any channels in English but I soon learned the French for strike and RER lines not running. Having a mini fridge was helpful, there was good cupboard space and a small desk and chair. There wasn't a locked box or safe as I had thought and the hotel didn't seem to have one. The bathroom was luxurious with heated towel rail and free toiletries. The double glazed windows largely drowned out the noise from the protesters and the location would have been excellent if the RER was running.It is near Nation which has multiple metro lines. The internal walls were very thin but I was only disturbed on one night with a very loud group of Germans in the next room. The hotel is on a pretty tree lined street and my room had a lovely view of Boulevard Voltaire. There are small shops nearby to buy drinks etc.and autotellers. The pictures on the website did show what the room was actually like.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value for Money\u201d", "Author": "DonaBradley", "ReviewID": "UR114981030", "Content": "This hotel was a surprise when we paid as little as we did.

After staying at 2 other hotels in Belgium, we were a little disappointed with this specific hotel. We were put in a room that faced a very busy street and the noise kept us up. The weather was quite warm so without the windows open, the room was stuffy and hot. However, due to the noise, we HAD to keep the windows shut. The elevator was broken during our stay and we had to haul our luggage up severl flights of stairs. The hotel DOES offer a breakfast (for a fee), but I saw what it included and would recommend walking down the street to one of the fabulous bakeries and getting something from there. The biggest PRO of this hotel is LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! It was a five-minute walk from a metro and from there we could go anywhere in Paris. Just a small tip from me to other travellers: if traveling on a budget, be mindful of the fact that it's cheaper to have drinks and pastries AT THE BAR instead of sitting down. You pay a premium for the wait staff. That is what my husband and I discovered half-way through our trip.", "Date": "October 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "paris", "Title": "\u201cvery bad service\u201d", "Author": "gmichels_ext", "ReviewID": "UR24615893", "Content": "When I arrived at the hotel my room was not held for me even though I had a booking confirmation printed out with me and I had paid for the rrom online.

The rooms are standard size for a 2 star. Our bathroom was the size of a American hotel bathroom (meaning much larger than your standard European one); however, a friend traveling with us had a single room and his bath was much smaller. The staff was very friendly and English speaking. We stayed during a particularly warm weekend in June, so the central AC was very welcome. If you're looking to save money by not staying in the heart of the city, Hotel du Prince Eugene is in a prefect location -- directly in the middle of two seperate subway stations that can get you anywhere you want to go. The subway stops running at 10:00p, so if you stay in the city late at night, you'll have to catch a bus or cab (we chose cab and paid a reasonable 15 Euro). Our only complaint is that the hotel linens really need updating. The blankets were somewhat ratty. The sheets and towels are okay, but they too will soon need replacing. Overall, the hotel was a great value for the low cost (75 Euro/night for the double).", "Date": "July 2, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel du Prince Eugene", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d567407-Reviews-Hotel_du_Prince_Eugene-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$105 - $248*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">247 Boulevard Voltaire</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75011</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "567407", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/1f/1d/1f1dc8dddd9c4853303719b43e049ad45large.jpg"}}
