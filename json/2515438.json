I'll just go through some of the main points: Location: if you don't want to be right next to the beach, this is a good place. As others have said, it's in more of a business area, well away from the ocean. (When I jogged to Torrey Pines State Beach, it took just more than 3 miles.) The good thing about this is it was a quiet place. No children, mostly business people. So that was nice. It takes 15-20 minutes to get to the Gaslight Quarter from here. Also about a 15 minute drive to get to Del Mar Beach. Accommodations: standard Garden Inn. No better or worse than what I've been from other places. We did have an issue with a couple ants in the room. But that was about all. Amenities: pool and hot whirlpool. Both were fine, though the whirlpool was a bit sudsy. Decent fitness center with treadmill, recumbent bike, a few weights. What I liked about it was a restroom is attached to it, so you don't have to go looking for one. Fitness center could use a fan, though. Restaurant: they've got one, but I didn't use it. The first night, we were told it was closed for an event. Later learned the event was an off-site staff party. Which was fine, but it would've been nice to be told when reserving that it'd be closed. The second night we were there, it was very, very busy. Staff: again, standard Garden Inn. If there's one recommendation I'd give them, it's to remember that the business center is attached to their offices. So customers using the business center will hear everything that's being said in the office. Also, for travelers, be aware that there's no Hilton Honors recognition, if that's important to you.

The free internet worked great and the ethernet cable was already in the room if needed instead of having to ask for it at the front desk like most hotels.

The bathroom was pretty tiny which was really my only complaint with the room as a whole. It made getting ready a little more challenging. The hotel itself was very quiet, I never heard a peep from other guests our entire stay! Parking was free but sometimes hard to come by and spaces were a little tight (We have a full size SUV). The pool was small and the salon/spa looked out onto the pool area so my husband was not comfortable taking my daughter-he wished it had been a little more private. I'm sure if you are looking for more privacy it would be fine to use after the salon/spa closes for the day. Room service was excellent-both the service and food were great. Very friendly staff throughout our stay. The area itself was very quiet and removed which is good and bad. We found this to be a plus because it was quiet and felt very safe, but on the other hand it's a bit of a drive from most things. No fast food close by, etc...
