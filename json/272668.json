The parking garage is very convenient, the bed is nice and firm, the shower is reasonably good, and the wi-fi is free. The attendant at the front desk even went out of his way to help me print a document with their printer. My only complaint with this hotel is their ridiculous policy of resetting the electronic room locks every day, supposedly for security purposes. Three times I was locked out of my room because I was unaware of this policy, and each time I went to the front desk to have my room key reprogrammed. On each occasion, I provided my room number but was not asked for my name or ID, and yet my key was reset to open the room I specified. I could have gotten access to ANY room in this manner. How exactly is this supposed to improve security?!? When I checked out, I asked about this policy, and I was told that guests were losing their room keys with the envelope that indicates their room number. So in an attempt to solve that problem, the policy actually reduces the security for all guests.

But the giant \"Foot clinic\" sign (God, I wish I had taken a picture!!), sort of added to the charm, I suppose. There's excellent food and coffee options within walking distance. I highly recommend \"Local\" - about 2 blocks north on Sunset. And the vegan Thai restaurant that is right next door was supposed to be really good. I didn't get the chance to try it. The room itself (I stayed in a non-smoking King) was very spacious. The bed was pretty comfortable but the bedding and pillows left alot to be desired. Some of the furniture was worn and older as well. Overall, though, it was a well equipped room - large flat screen tv. dresser, desk, table with two chairs, microwave, coffee maker, closet with iron and board, and two large windows. I asked for a quiet room, so I wasn't bothered by any traffic noise from Sunset Blvd. The bathroom was modern and nice, but the sink was just outside the bathroom - sort of strange.

The mattresses, pillows and bedding are in excellent condition. Wireless internet service is fast, reliable and free. Climate control unit works well and isn't too loud. Plenty of hot water and good water pressure. Lots of channels of cable TV. Free covered parking also is a big plus. And then there's the room rate, which so far has been remarkably economical for LA. Don't be put off by the external appearance: the hotel is on the second and third floors of a somewhat rundown-looking small retail plaza, and the reception desk is behind thick plexiglass of the type you might normally associate with a liquor store in a sketchy neighborhood. No worries: the rooms, while a bit spartan, are just fine. And everything is in quite good condition. And the neighborhood appears quite safe by big-city standards. The other guests I've seen or met seem very nice. Plenty of young people seeing LA on a budget, which is fun to be around now that I'm well past my Youth Hostel years. Oh, and twice I've shared a late nightcap in the breakfast room with some touring indie band just wrapping up a show at one of the nearby clubs. All very friendly, and I've never had a problem with noise at night. The neighborhood is conveniently walkable, bikeable and busable -- moreso than you'd expect in LA. 15 minutes walk in either direction on Sunset will give you plenty to eat, drink, hear, see or buy. I got to Hollywood in less than 20 minutes by bus. I have only two minor quibbles. One is the breakfast, which not of the highest quality (but there's plenty else around in the neighborhood). The other is the air freshener the housekeepers use in the guest rooms, which is very strong and they seem to use a lot of it.

We picked this motel location by zip code, because it was closest to her apartment. We had just finished a 4 month long motorcycle trip across the USA, and had spent at least 100 of the past 120 days in motels across the country. This was the first Comfort Inn of this trip, however, even though we had visited Comfort Inns in years past.. First, I have to say that you cannot judge this hotel based upon it's location in W. LA - this area is what it is, and you shouldn't expect anything more than a barrio atmosphere. Be aware of your surroundings and you won't be in danger. We ate at a great Mexican restaurant nearby, named Casita del Campos about one mile from the motel, on Hyperion. Be aware that there is a charge for self parking your car in their lot. The motel itself looks as though it has been renovated. The furnishings are newer, our king sized bed was very comfortable and had 5 pillows. The bedding is clean as were the towels, and bath fixtures. The long review from the lady from NYC from September 2007, explains everything very well, as to room amenities, staff, breakfast, etc. The only complaint is that the carpeting in our room (#211) was filthy. I am also from NYC, and I don't scheeve easily, but our socks were ruined by the dirt, and we won't dare walk barefoot! I took one of the hand towels and rubbed it on the carpet near the bed, and was appalled by the filth it picked up. The carpet and room have a smell (probably caused by the dirty carpet) that permeates the entire area. The odor actually awakened my husband and I during the night. We sprayed the room with Febreze, but it did little to mask the stench. Unfortunately, we are at the beginning of our 2nd night here, (out of 3), and I don't know if I'll be able to tolerate the smell that long. I considered asking the desk clerk if we could change rooms, but I doubt that our room is the only one with dirty, smelly carpet. If you are considering staying at this Comfort Inn location, I would suggest you call the hotel directly, and ask them to put you into a room where the carpet has been recently cleaned.

She was on the phone dealing with another customer and trying to serve me at the same time. Also she was speaking in Mexican the whole time to her collegue so I had to keep repeating myself to her as she wasn't listening and couldn't hear me over her speech. She was very rude in my opinion.

The Comfort Inn, as others have noted, is really a mile or so south of Silver Lake proper, but you can be in the heart of that wonderful neighborhood in minutes. More to the point, you can be downtown in 15 minutes if (and this is important) you avoid the temptation to take freeways, which at certain hours will delay you hopelessly.

Previous reviews have said the neighbourhood is unsafe and I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disagree with that, the area is a bit seedy but I went across the road to the small strip mall to do my laundry and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel unsafe. A little further west on Sunset Boulevard there is a trendy area called Silver Lake which has lots of nice restaurants and cafes. As with anywhere in Los Angeles you really do need a car and the hotel does have an underground parking area which unlike some other motels I have stayed at in Los Angeles had nice wide spaces, although it is advertised as secure parking the gate at the entrance was never closed from what I saw. The hotels address is West Sunset Boulevard, but it is located at the very eastern end of Sunset Boulevard close to downtown Los Angeles and staying here like practically anywhere in Los Angeles a car is required and the traffic is bad all the time so a short journey anywhere can take a long time. The hotel itself is really nice for the price, one of the cheaper hotel I found online. I stayed in room 303 and it was a pleasant surprise, really large room, laid out on an unusual way as it was a corner room, king size bed, fridge, microwave, coffee maker, air conditioning, large TV with about 70 stations, free wireless internet that worked really well. I had a smoking room and while I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t smoke I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find any offensive odours in the room. One of the previous reviews said that there was no door between the bathroom and bedroom and mine did and also had a large dressing area. The room was cleaned spotlessly every day and restocked with anything I had used. No real view to speak of from my room just buildings in the distance over the roof of the small apartment building next door. Like a lot of the US chain motels they do have a continental breakfast in the lobby, pretty standard stuff, cereal, toast, pastries, coffee plus they have a couple of waffle machines which seemed very popular. They only have seating for about 12 people but I was there early and they serve breakfast form 6.30 to 9.30, but I could imagine it getting crowded later in the morning. I paid US77 per night plus taxes and think for the price it was a good deal. A couple of things that could be improved they have a key card system for the room door and each day that has to be recoded which they say is for security but it is a bit of a nuisance and the code for the free internet also has to have a new password each day plus they have a street level parking area at the lobby level that serves the hotel plus a couple of stores that occupy the street level which was closed for my entire stay which made the only parking the underground lot which I always found a spot in it but a couple of nights it was the last spot.

This is my last night in this hotel and I couldn't be happier with the choice. I don't usually travel alone, and though a New York City native, I did have some trepidation about staying alone in a hotel in L.A. I agree with all of the reviewers who mentioned the excellent security at this hotel. There are cameras everywhere and yes, the front desk is behind a glass partition. Rather than making me nervous by their mere existence, they really have made me feel safer. As for the rooms, I cannot understand how other reviewers have described this place as a basic, no-frills hotel. My room is extremely spacious, as are most of the others I've seen in passing. All the rooms I've seen have been renovated: the vanity is granite, with a new faucet. The bathtub surround is flat-panel stone, with NONE of the grout and tiles that can be covered with mold. In fact, the bedroom and bath are spotless. There's a small, quiet refrigerator and a microwave that sits on granite shelves, and both are also completely clean. The king-sized bed is covered in a luxurious-looking burnt-orange shiny quilted new-looking bedspread. The bed itself could be a little softer, but it's not rock-hard either; this non-sleeper has slept well. Even the entry doorsill and hinges have been replaced. There is a desk, armoire, table, and three chairs, and there is still a huge amount of room to walk around. The carpet is not old, but during my stay all of the rooms were having the carpets restretched and cleaned. The shower is good, with a new, adjustable showerhead. The lighting is good in the bedroom and bathroom, and there are two telephones. My only complaint is that the table and one of the chairs could use replacement. The lobby is small, but furnished with newer furniture in excellent condition, and the small breakfast room is bright and modern, too. A number of people wrote about the somewhat seedy neighborhood. Having driven back all the way on Sunset from West Hollywood to the hotel, the neighborhood does change - stores and restaurants are closed and largely ethnic, mostly Hispanic. It certainly does not have the glitz and polish and lighting of the areas I was coming from. But not once did I feel unsafe. I did not use the underground parking, because the lobby is at one end of a small strip mall with outdoor parking, and I was able to park one foot away from the hotel lobby. After booking this hotel by calling Choice's 800 number, I later did a comparison on Choice Hotel's own website among this hotel and four other Comfort Inns in the area. I was dismayed to see that this was the only one that did not have high speed internet service listed for the rooms. I was about to cancel my reservation, but then decided to call Choice to verify it. They made a direct call to the hotel and told me that they did indeed have high speed in all the rooms. I am using it right now, and it has worked perfectly. I did not have a chance to check out the actual breakfast - I either slept in or had to leave very early before they began serving. But on my first morning I asked the desk after breakfast was over if I might be able to get some bread for toast. No problem. The guy at the desk called and got the woman in charge of breakfast to come down and get me some food. She gave me a plate of bread and pastries and, of course, there is always coffee available. In closing, I must say that I am a snob about hotels. I absolutely cannot stay in an old room; I find it too depressing. And I'm squeamish and easily skeeved, and will not tolerate anything that is not immaculate. Also, I always stay in smoking rooms. This hotel room was not only one step away from being sterilized, it is also the only smoking room I've been in anywhere that doesn't have that nauseating, suffocating smell of stale smoke. And that goes for the hallways, too, despite what one woman wrote about it. I can sniff out smoke anywhere, at any time, but not at this place. They're certainly doing something right. This Comfort Inn has got to be the best deal in L.A. For $81 a night, you cannot get better. And I'd wager that your room in a high-rise hotel would not be any nicer. As long as you have a car and a map, it would be very short-sighted to stay somewhere else.

It is a good value. Smoking: if you smoke this is not a problem, but even in the non smoking rooms you might have a stale smoking odor. I didn't encounter any actual smoke during my visit, in the rooms, halls or lobby. The odor is probably caused by past smoking in the halls that leaks into the room. Location: The location is convenient (if you have a car) midway between downtown Los Angeles and Hollywood. There is a bus on Sunset Blvd., but I recommend that you have a car. One last point: Don't confuse this Comfort Inn with the one near McArthur Park. This motel is in the Echo Park neighborhood.

The room was very comfortable and quite new. They gave the most pillows that I had seen on our entire trip (very comfy ones too!)- about 6 on each bed! The breakfast was excellent. Pastries, bagels, cereal etc and it all was very fresh and nice. The problem for us was the cigarette smoke. We booked a non smoking room as we dont smoke and we have a toddler. We were shocked to find that the corridors of the hotel were smoker friendly! So the smokers were filling the halls with smoke which I could smell in our room even with a wet towel across the bottom of the door! I was appalled. We had to walk through it with my son and I am just amazed that the hotel has this policy. When my husband spoke to the front desk regarding this they were not suprised and had heard similar complaints from other guests. However they just stated that it was hotel policy. However NOWHERE on their website does it mention this. You would expect them to have at least one non smoking floor. Many places we stayed were entirely non smoking. The other downside for us was that the area seemed (like a lot of inner LA) a bit on the rough side.Its convenient for hollywood but took over 1 hour in traffic to reach Venice Beach/Santa Monica pier. Its also not convenient for the airport. Next time I would stay nearer the airport which is also nearer to the beach areas. The hotel seemed quite secure though, there were cctv cameras on each corner of the corridor and the underground car park has a gate that can only be opened with a room key after it closes at 6pm. This is also cctv monitored. On the downside there is no room safe and to our surprise no safe at reception! I was woken at about 3am by someone playing about with their car stereo in the outside parking and the sound of traffic is constant all night long. Im glad we only stayed the one night but if you are a smoker and are in LA for seeing Hollywood then im sure you could do a lot worse.

I think if you find this neighbourhood fearsome you are a bit precious -- I parked outside and the car was fine, and at no point in my travels did I feel unsafe. I'm pretty sure most experienced travellers would feel fine. Everything was very clean. I was given a corner king room which felt tucked away and private. The TV had a lot of channels. The free wireless internet was appreciated -- that always seals the deal for me. (My room was too far from the access point to get a signal, but I was given an ethernet cable by the front desk, which is fine.) In the morning there was juice, all kinds of baked goods (frozen & thawed, but that's alright), waffle batter, fruit, etc. It was much more than what I expect from a continental breakfast. My only issue with the hotel was the rate -- I had a coupon from a local guidebook, but the rate was actually $10 more. The clerk said that they had raised the rate after the book was printed. In my view, the advertised rate should be honoured, as that was what brought me to the hotel. But really, it's a clean, relatively cheap place near some good neighbourhoods and the freeway.
