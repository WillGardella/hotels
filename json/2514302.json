I prepaid for 2 nights at the Romanos Hotel at 31 Charlwood street, Victoria, London. I took the metro to Victoria station and walked to the small hotel. Immediately, upon entering their lobby, I knew I probably couldn't stay just from the condition of the lobby. I ask the clerk behind the desk if I could view the room first. He stated that it didn't matter if I liked the room or not, I was still paying. He acted put out that I would want to see the room first but reluctantly did take me to the room because I insisted. the hotel was very run down, smelled horribly and was not somewhere I could stay. I left the hotel. I am currently attempting to get the charges reversed through my credit card company since I didn't stay the two nights. That day, I e-mailed BHRC because I wanted them to know how unhappy I was that they would place me in such a bad hotel. I never heard back from them. I ended up re-emailing them 2 more times, each time requesting a response but never received any. It's apparent to me that BHRC is less concerned about providing adequate lodging than obtaining the booking fee kick back that they receive from the London establishments that they represent. Don't use BHRC for your bookings and stay away from the Romanos Hotel unless you normally like to stay in run down, smelly, unkempt surroundings.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBy far the worst place I have ever stayed in.\u201d", "Author": "mary h", "ReviewID": "UR116973064", "Content": "I was staying overnight en route to France and had intended to return for one evening on my way home five days later.

The ensuite bathroom was outside my room and up a flight of stairs! I was told on arrival that no-one would be around to provide breakfast at 6.30am \"for just one person\" The lady who welcomed me to the hotel could not have made me feel any less valued as a client. My room was filthy - I have stayed in developing and war-torn countries where facilities are basic, however they have always been far cleaner than my room. The bedding alone was unpleasant, without mentioning the other hygiene concerns! Having spent a reasonable \u00a315 on a taxi from Euston to the hotel, which is a short distance from Victoria, I was very surprised when I was quoted \u00a319 for a taxi organised by reception to take me and my luggage to Westminster Cathedral to pick up the next stage of my journey. Thankfully I knew where I was going, as reception had booked the taxi to take me to Westminster Abbey! It seems to be the sort of place where people rent rooms by the hour - hardly what you would like to stay amongst as a stop over!

Official complaint.\u201d", "Author": "marcdoudin", "ReviewID": "UR104246198", "Content": "Hello Romanos, I was staying in your \"hotel\" the last 7 nights. I wanted to place a complaint via e-mail. It was incredible. I booked your hotel by Gatwick Station and paid 70 pounds for one night. 70 pounds is the price for a good hotel. Coming to your hotel, your personnel received me with a friendly \"Room 8, Floor 2\", without any comment or any advices. Well, I can live with that. But coming into the room, I felt like: how come I can't even turn around in my bathroom? Well maybe that's a matter of design, but in my home bathroom I can't brush my teeth, being on toilette and taking a shower at the same time, because it's not that small. Coming to your breakfast in the morning means having no space for legs, arms or anything. The \"Continental Breakfast\" consisted of six toasts (who would ever dare to ask for more for two people being served by such a \"nice\" personnel) and one egg. Well, at least a cup of tea then. Next experience was the room service. Brilliant. After three days, pillow and blanket were incredibly dirty. How did you \"clean\" that? Speaking about cleaning: Have you ever washed your towels? I rather felt like drying myself with my clothes. Other things: the walls looked like a fancy pattern by a modern artists (dirty, musty, HEALTH!!!!!!), the lamp of my bedside was broken and the room service didn't ever clean anything. The worst thing of your hotel, dear Romanos, is not the filthyness and the dirty rooms and unreliable personnel. No, it's the missing friendlyness, the missing passion of all of your staff. I did not feel welcome, I did not feel good, I just felt bad in your hotel. After four nights, the room service knocked at my door at half past eight in the morning and told me to get out of the hotel. I needed to leave the hotel because I haven't paid yet. \"Aha. They got it after four nights, fine.\", I thought. Once again: Me and my friend, we paid 70 POUNDS FOR THAT ROOM PER NIGHT, 6 NIGHTS. Cheers. Oh btw, you remember that I've booked via Victoria Station? Yes, so I paid before and I couldn't leave the hotel, if that could be an argument of yours. We unfortunately needed to add one night more because we stayed one night longer in London and were too late for booking another hotel. Your only comment was \"Have you paid? You need to pay, or you leave\". Well.. we wanted to pay via credit card, but that was not possible without an extra charge of 5 POUNDS FOR PAYING BY CARD. We went to a cash machine and got back to you. You said like \"Give me the Key\" to log that thing in. Another thing, and the actual claiming of this e-mail is the incredible amount we needed to pay for our room. 70 pounds is, considering your own pricelist on the internet, 11 pounds too much per day. Your double rooms cost 59 pounds, which is your own tag. (Source: www.romanos-hotel.co.uk) I claim 77 pounds payback. 7 nights, 11 pounds each. If you don't pay back those 77 pounds, I feel obliged to send the whole, and I mean, the whole complaint to each forum I can find that has any relation to hotels or London. Also, I'm sending this as a copy to the official LONDON HOTEL CONTROLLERS. I placed that complaint already in a oral way. But you didn't care about it, so I decided to give it another try via e-mail.

Apparently their motto is: \"Stay comfortable ... Pay reasonable.\" I laughed when I read that on my door! Upon arrival at this hotel I was rather disappointed. After a three hour journey to get to London I arrived eager to drop off my heavy bag + freshen up ready to see the sights. However I was told that my room was not ready; I would have to wait until 4pm to check-in. Though this was rather inconvenient I agreed to come back later, but was suspicious at the way the staff wanted me to pay now + leave straight away. By the time i walked back out the door the manager shouted \"See you at six o'clock then - make sure you dont come back before six!\" which made me quite suspicious that the time had again changed. Returning four hours later at six o'clock i was told the room was still not ready + again asked to pay before entering which i refused until i had seen the room. Eventually the manager guided me in + i was quite horrified at the state of the room after all the waiting. It was extremely cramped with just enough room to walk around the bed (which had rather dodgy looking sheets; i am doubtful they had been cleaned since the last guest). The 'ensuite' bathroom was simply a broom cupboard with a contraption that looked like a shower with a toilet built in the bowl! I was surprised also that after all that time cleaning there was a collection of hairs in the shower and at the back of the toilet! After reading on the website that the hotel had recently been refurbished and described as \"modern and tastefully designed, offering a warm relaxing atmosphere and a high degree of comfort\" I felt extremely let down and frustrated. By now it was 7 o'clock + having looked at many hotels coming towards Romano's with NO VACANCIES signs in the windows, I had no choice but to accept the room + sleep there for the night. I was sure i had seen the worst of the place anyway... That was until at around 10.30 at night a cleaning lady strolled into my room, grabbed a pillow off my bed + walked out again, not saying 2 words to me! I was appalled! After a sleepless night laying on top of the sheets, not daring to climb in (it was incredibly stuffy in there anyway) i went down to breakfast which was served by the same lady, who again said nothing to me. The layout was awful as the tables were not properly set. Some had cups, others did not, some had condiments and others did not. Choosing the table with the cups i sat down only to find the cups + plates were dirty. i was given two boiled eggs which were cold and when i cracked the shell, was digusted to find the yolk was black!? This was the case for both of them! I quickly chewed a bit of cold dry toast (i was not given butter) and sharply left ... passing a family in the reception being told that there room was not yet ready!

It's also a few minutes' walk from the Victoria rail and coach station (direct buses to/from Luton, Gatwick, Stansted), and Pimlico tube. The hotel was very clean in general - only the bed covers look a bit worn up. Most of the rooms are accessible only through a steep and narrow stairway - you just have to consider it if you're going to book there. Accomodation is no frills - toilet in the room is the size of a wardrobe - tiny sink, toilet and shower all packed into a box about 1 per 2 meters. The sink is old British style - meaning two taps, cold and hot water separately. The problem was that it missed a plug - in fact, all sinks in the hotel missed them. The lady at the check-in desk promised to provide us with this useful device, but at the end we wouldn't get it - even though we stayed there for more than a week! There isn't much of space in the room to place your belongings - a set of coat hangers, a shelf and a \"desk\" (that's what they call it in the promo materials) which is, in fact, another shelf. So we kept most of our stuff in the suitcase. The electric kettle was OK, so was the TV, and there was a hairdryer available at the reception desk. The breakfasts were really OK - \"continental\", as they call it, which means a set of tosts, cereal, an egg, tea or coffee and assorted jams. A good way of starting a day, and really useful since you don't have to start your trips hungry and looking for food. The dining room is of course very small, like everything at Romanos, so it was good that not many of the guests got up early enough to bother themselves with the breakfast (which was served from 7-something to 9 on weekdays, 8 to 9 or ten on weekends). There is also a small courtyard you may use for breakfast if the weather is good enough - which it wasn't. Okay, to sum it all up. If you plan on touring the city all day long, and just need a place to sleep and wash yourself up, then Hotel Romanos is OK. If you'd like to spend some more time in the hotel room or requre more than basic accomodations - you'd better search for another place. However, you possibly won't find it at this price - Holiday Inn Express on Belgrave costs about twice as much as the Romanos.", "Date": "May 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "devon", "Title": "\u201cbasic of basic!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "ratrog", "ReviewID": "UR14690684", "Content": "stayed at this hotel for 2 nights.upon arrival we had to pay CASH upfront,which we have never had to do(makes you think the owner doesn`t trust his guests).

She had been delayed on her flight and was very tired. She walked in to reception and the receptionist told her she was not allowed in the room until she had paid the total outstanding amount (even though a deposit had been paid). My mother asked if she could pay by debit card and was told that she would be charged a \u00a310 handling fee. She said she would get cash and pay later but the receptionist would not let her in the room until she had paid so she had to go out and find the nearest cash-point (about 20 minutes walk away) before she was allowed in the room. The room was small but clean. Booking en-suite is not worth it. It literally is a cupboard with toilet, shower and sink in. We ended up using the communal shower as it was bigger and had more space. The breakfast room is a small room crammed with camping tables and chairs. Breakfast was okay: toast, two types of cereal and a hard-boiled egg, but again the staff were awful and made you feel like a burden for being there. If you want a cheap room for the night, take cash to pay for the room upfront. If you are looking for a bit of hospitality, don't bother staying at this hotel - they do not know what the word means!", "Date": "July 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona", "Title": "\u201ca horrible place\u201d", "Author": "penzance", "ReviewID": "UR7292695", "Content": "I stayed in the hotel for one night after spending some days in cornwall and it was really horrible.

All the rooms are suposed to have writing desk and seating area but ours didn't have any space even for a chair. We didn't see any alarm clock. What we had was the walls full of stains, and the blanket that was suposed to be white was grey and dirty. All the rooms had card keys access except our so we guessed that our room woud had been a storage room a box room or a junk room before being a bedroom. If you stay in Romanos avoid room 2.
