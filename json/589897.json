{"Reviews": [{"Content": "No better than last time I once again stayed for the weekend and unfortunately the Hotel has dropped even further. From the moment we booked in and the reception asked if we wanted seperate rooms-even though this time I booked as Mr and Mrs beerfreind-the reception was cold and uninviting.The room - on executive floor was clean and comfortable. Room service banging on our door at 8.45 wanting to clean was not appreciated on any of the three mornings. The breakfast was average and cold. We stayed at Raffles on our previous visit and after this last effort we will return to Raffles in the future. Sad that a hotel could fall this far from grace", "Date": "Oct 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR119338462", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "beerfreind"}, {"Content": "Better than Beijing Holiday Inns This review is based on 5 or 6 stays at this hotel.Fine, polished (literally) lobby. Check in service is slow, writing details down manually.The best aspect of this hotel is the rooms, which are very comfortable including high quality bedding, good climate control, and fine bathrooms with excellent showers, baths and soft towels.The rooms are not completely soundproofed so if you're noise sensitive, ask for a quieter room, perhaps on a higher floor. There is some street noise outside from traffic.The coffee shop buffet at breakfast is very good (except for the coffee: so-so), but I recommend going out rather than eating the dinner buffet which is mediocre.As is usual in China, the hotel only distributes poor quality state run newspapers, but you can get real news via fast free internet connection in every room.The hotel is 15 mins. walk or 5 mins. taxi ride from Sanlitun, an evening entertainment area with a series of bars featuring live bands, some from the Philippines.All in all, this is a reasonable and comfortable hotel for a short stay in Beijing, and better than some of the branded chains.", "Date": "May 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR524550165", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Peter_Smallhill"}, {"Content": "Five star room, three star service, two star food This is a nice new modern hotel and the rooms are really comfortable and nice. However, they food is dreadful. I ordered a chicken dish for room service and they brought up something that was 3/4 hot peppers and 1/4 tiny chicken pieces wrapped around bones. I've eaten plenty of Chinese food so my problems weren't cultural. When I complained I was told that I just didn't like Chinese food. I asked for something else and they brought it up. But, they expected me to pay for the bad chicken dish. I complained that I shouldn't have to pay. The women said she would check with her manager. She called a little while later to say that just this time they would make an exception and I wouldn't have to pay. I was made to feel as if I was some crazy westerner. This is not what one expects in a five star hotel. The Internet connection here is also extraordinarily slow. I need a fast connection for work so I had to go to a nearby Internet cafe. If they could bring the service and the food up to the standards of the rooms this would be a nice hotel. For now, I say stay at the nearby Sheraton.", "Date": "May 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR206028917", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "LSydell"}, {"Content": "OK hotel, with good sized rooms but food  I stayed at the KunTai on business and thought my room was really good; very spacious and clean with all mod cons. The things that didn't really impress me though were the food which was really quite mixed i.e. some things were delicious and others inedible and the Spa where I got an awful massage that left me quite uncomfortably sore for a few days. The hotel is really well located though for most things so as long as you avoid the Spa and eat out where possible it probably is not a dreadful choice for visiting Beijing. It is worth noting it isn't remotely 'authentic' though (just like any western chain hotel really) so if you were on holiday and wanted something a bit more 'Chinese' I wouldn't recommend it.", "Date": "May 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR306571723", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "GingerTraveller"}, {"Content": "Good Stayed here 11 days on business.The basics here are very good: very spacious room, clean, comfortable bed, and excellent soundproofing between rooms. The bathroom was large and excellent, finished entirely in marble.The pool is very nice, but be sure to bring a bathing cap (you can buy one there, but it is very overpriced).Within a few minutes' walk are numerous restaurants, several ATMs (plus one in the lobby), a large supermarket, a Starbucks, and a clothing bazaar. The Forbidden City area is about 10 minutes West by taxi (or about 45 minutes by foot).One serious problem: the (free, wired) internet connection worked OK for Chinese sites, but varied from slow to useless for US sites. The problem appears to be with the hotel's choice of ISP, as I had no such problems from the office building across the street. There is a internet cafe one block east (I did not try it).Quibbles: most of the furniture seems to have been designed for a much smaller room. Given the size of the room, a larger desk/work area would have been appreciated. The electrical outlets are too few and too artfully hidden. My room was too hot, and the thermostat temperature setting and heat/cool switch don't do anything -- only on/off actually does what it says. You can open the window, but with Beijing pollution that isn't ideal. The plumbing fixtures look nice, but are not of the highest quality -- I had to request maintenance on them several times.", "Date": "Dec 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR307936262", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Xman_7"}, {"Content": "Nice, but room too hot Very nice hotel, good beds and a nice buffet breakfast. My only complaint was that the air conditioning was not working, and it was too hot in the room.

The menu for dinner seems to have a lot of fusion dishes on it, food was good, but don't expect Chinese food here. You could listen to the TV in the bathroom, and you could control the volume. The bathroom was very luxuriously, and everything worked flawlessly. The wired Internet worked well and was very easy to get into. No extra charge for it.

Most can understand and speak English. - Bathroom is roomy - separate shower and bath areas. Enjoyed the bath tub. Hotel provides usual toiletries - soap, shampoo, bath gel, lotion, toothbrush, shower cap. Usual generic hotel toiletries. No bath salts or bubble bath.-Very helpful staff at the business center who helped me compose a letter in chinese.- Room not so big by asian standards. Not so good:- There are only three (3) non-smoking floors in the hotel. We were given a smoking room. Not happy with that. And the room was fully booked when we arrived due to some conference being held at the hotelso they couldnt transfer us to a non-smoking room. Good thing the room had windows. We left them open during our entire stay. - Electricity acting funny. Our lights suddenly went off in the middle of the night, probably due to some short circuit.

My friend and I stayed at the Kuntai for only one night at the end of May. I had booked online for a double room for approx $125CAD. Every experience with this place was fantastic. The porters and the clerks were quick, thoughtful and most importantly fluent in English. When you want to leave the hotel, there is already a line of taxi's waiting on the street. The concierge waves one over for you and translates for you where you want to go. (The silk alley - now relocated to one single building of super shopping fun, and the friendship store was only 10RMB away.)Our room was not small; however, with all the furniture in the room, which included a desk, a large armchair and the whole t.v/fridge/storage unit, the space was a little tight. Still, the linens were all crispy clean, pillows were balanced and fluffy, bathrobes were white and new. (Air conditioning was in good working order and it was quiet and comfortable.) The bathroom on the other hand was enourmous. The shower stall and the giant bathtub were separate. The decor and the dimming lights gives the right atmosphere for a relaxing soak. There were plenty of heavy towels and little knick knacks of shampoo, lotions, toothbrushes etc.. Of course, being a relatively new hotel, everything was also very clean; no sweaty pipes, moldy grout, or stained porcelin.
