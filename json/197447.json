The hotel was very clean and the services were great, the people were very nice and friendly except for the lady who served breakfast, who seemed to be in a bad mood every morning, I don't know the reasons (but I was in Paris two years ago, maybe she doesn't even work there any more). Breakfast was very good. The hotel is located not too close to the centre of the city and we had to walk from the hotel to the subway and back every morning and evening. This was a little annoying especially in the evening, when we were tired after a day of walking in the city. If you have a short stay, I recommend the hotel, but if you stay a week or more, maybe you should search for a location closer to the centre because after 3-4 days of walking to the subway and back and 20-30 minutes in the subway you will think that you waste a lot of your time in Paris every day making the trip to the centre of the city. But a very nice experience after all and great value for money.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Blaine, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely the right choice!\u201d", "Author": "HoJo4751", "ReviewID": "UR126596263", "Content": "We stayed at the GHF for a week to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary as well as a 65th birthday. The hotel definitely lived up to all the positive reviews - and then some. Our room (#53) was a bright, spotless, nicely decorated corner room with an unbelievably comfortable bed and a wonderful shower. It also had an amazing balcony from which we could watch the activity in the neighborhood. As others have said, the breakfast was delicious and satisfying and the woman who took care of the area for most of the week was a delight. As far as location - it was perfect! It was away from the hustle and bustle of crowds, but with both an RER and metro station at Nation just a 5 minute walk away, any tourist site in Paris was easily accessible. A \u201cParis Visite\u201d transportation pass really made things simple. Nation also gave us a quick connection to the Roissybus which we used for our transport to and from the airport. But the best part of the hotel was the incredible staff! Everyone greeted us with a smile and bent over backward to answer questions, give directions, or provide helpful suggestions. We especially enjoyed being able to talk with the people at the desk and find out more about day to day life in France and Paris in particular. To us, that\u2019s what travel is all about - learning the culture of an area. If you\u2019d like to avoid hordes of tourists and want a real Parisian experience, the GHF is the place to stay.

I know, as an American, we're sometimes not sure what to expect in a European hotel. This one, I assure you, will meet or exceed all your standards. In fact, we stayed in a nice hotel in NYC the night before arriving in Paris and it was half the size of the one at Le Grand Hotel Francais and not nearly as nice. The room here was large and well-appointed with a big bed, great bathroom/ shower, iPod dock, couch, bureau and a small balcony looking out on a quaint street. The price was right, with a good breakfast available downstairs and a bottle of champagne awaiting us on arrival. Be aware that you're not going to walk out the front door of this hotel and see the Eiffel Tower, but that's actually a huge plus. For one thing, this hotel is in a \"real Parisian neighborhood\". There are great restaurants and cafes all around this area and in Place de la Nation, which is 2 blocks away. The metro station is almost across the street with one train taking you to the best stop for the Eiffel Tower. But the real treat at this establishment is the hotel staff. They put up with my terrible French, gave us directions everywhere, made great restaurant recommendations, ordered us cabs and made us reservations at the cabaret \"Paradis Latin\" (great show) one night. Ziad (spelling?), the manager was extremely generous and attentive as was Oceane (sp?) who made great recommendations.

Obviously, this tells you something about the hotel, as it's fallen into our criteria of a good location and good reviews here twice now.

Our rooms cost 160E per night and were bought through booking.com in advance. There were two of us sharing a double room. It was a smallish room, but Paris is a city where space is at a premium, especially within the city centre. If you are a family, you could fit a travel cot in. We had a good sized double bed, a small desk and tea and coffee making facilities plus a small refrigerator (which contained complementary water). The room has climate control and window which opens onto a juliette balcony. The location is fairly quiet and the room is double-glazed so we were not disturbed by noise.

There were no cereals specifically aimed at children, just cornflakes and museli.

The room was relatively quiet - although I probably should have brought earplugs as the hotel got busier over the weekend and the walls weren't not the thickest. The neighborhood seemed to be relatively safe and quiet, with plenty of restaurants and grocery stores nearby. It is a neighborhood with many Jewish residents so some of the restaurants are closed Friday nights and Saturdays, as are some of the grocery stores but it's not impossible to find other places open.

The place is extremely close to Metro station Rue des Boulettes and within walking distance to big metro Nation (but if you're new to Paris and arrive after switching to other metro station, get another metro (M9?) to Rue des Boulettes instead of trying to figure out which exit from Nation that goes to Boulevard Voltaire.

After dropping off the luggage at the hotel and turning in the car, we checked in and were immediately impressed by Nicholas, who was working at the front desk. He was very polite, welcoming and accommodating as the room was not yet ready (we were early). The hotel is compact in every respect, but very nicely appointed and decorated and very comfortable. Later, we met Zyad and, like Nicholas, was very helpful and informative in everything we needed including arranging transportation to CDG. Be sure to ask about the hotel restaurant recommendations because, if you like Italian food, they will direct you to an outstanding place, \"Cefalu\", just around the block. The friendliest husband and wife run the place and the food is \"squisito\"! The Metro is close-by with several lines available. The location is a fair distance from many of the major sights, but the Metro brings them very close. In addition, there is a better feeling of living among the Parisiens as opposed to other tourists. Count the people carrying baguettes versus cameras. Our first thought about the area was wrong. For us, this hotel checked all the boxes and we would love to visit there again.

After getting our luggage and purchasing metro tickets, we took the Orlyval train from the airport to the Metro station in Antony for our first connection on the way to the hotel. We arrived at the hotel just before 10pm. Using the metro was great for us. We got off at the Nation metro station and walked less than ten minutes to the hotel. On arrival, the front desk gentleman checked us into our room. We took the lift up to the first floor and entered our room, only to find women's undergarments strewn all-over the bed and a shower running in the restroom. Either we were about to receive a warm welcome to Paris, or we got the wrong room. After returning to the front desk, we were given a different room on a higher floor. The front desk attendant said he did not know if we would be moved the next day. He also told us that breakfast was available for a fee in the morning. I informed him that our reservation included breakfast. He said we could work it out with the manager in the morning. So we headed up to our room. The room was fantastic. It had a comfortable bed and plenty of wonderful amenities including a refrigerator, coffee pot, television with a few English channels, plenty of room for our backpacks and luggage, and a safe.

He also confirmed that due to our Expedia status, we would indeed be able to enjoy our breakfast for free. Breakfast included a nice selection of meats, cheeses, breads, fruit, coffee, tea and juices. The breakfast was buffet-style, and a staff prepared our hot beverages for us. All-in-all, we had a wonderful stay at this hotel and will gladly return on our next trip to Paris. The hotel is several miles from Paris' major sites, but thanks to the metro system, everything form the Eiffel Tower, to Notre Dame, Arc de Triomphe and The Louvre are just a quick train ride away.

We really enjoyed our stay. The staff was wonderful from Zyed to the gentleman from Lyon working the night shift. They were very helpful, friendly and down to earth. The last two nights of our stay were we upgraded to a suite which was a very nice touch. The room the first two nights was quite small compared to North American standards but that is the norm for Paris. The rooms are tastefully decorated and the little things are what makes this hotel a gem. We stayed 2 nights then travelled to Dublin and then went back to Paris for two nights and they let us store some of our luggage there for two days which really helped us. The front desk let us use their wine glasses so we could sample Parisian wine without using plastic cups, they lent my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 a voltage adapter because she forgot hers and they also lent us a wine opener to use for our entire stay. The slippers that come with the room are also a very nice touch as is the shampoo that is in the bathrooms, you can actually use it unlike other hotels I have stayed at. The breakfast in the morning was outstanding, simple yet everything you need to start your day in a meaningful fashion. The location to me is probably the best part of staying at the GHF. Some people might look at being outside of the main part of the city as a negative but to me it allowed us to get away from the hassle and bustle of sightseeing, it allowed us to enjoy suburban Paris and also let us see another part of Paris we normally would not have seen. GHF is a 5 minute walk to Nation station, which gives you access to EVERYTHING in Paris from the Eiffel tower, to the airport to Notre Dame, everything can be accessed from this station. The metro is very easy to use, it looks overwhelming on a map but is actually very simple to use.

Such a different 'reception' to the last hotel we stayed in when visiting Paris some years ago. The area is great; it is a non-touristy area, with some great restaurants (Les Galopins!) its only a few minutes walk to the metro which will take you to the main attractions. When you have done all the hustle and bustle during the day, you can come back to the hotel and it's non crowded streets. That's what we did because we prefered to eat our evening meal in this area, away from the tourists and the tourist prices.

As others have described: the bedroom and bathroom have been nicely renovated and they were absolutely spotless. Room size appears to be within the norm for Europe. Rooms have all the amenities: air, safe, fridge, wall-mounted flat screen tv, phone, wardrobe, desk, luggage rack, hair dryer. While there wasn't an ironing board and iron, they will do your laundry (we had ours washed and dried for free - please do remember service like this deserves a good tip). Although the hotel is physically nice, it is the STAFF that makes it exceptional! The front desk is manned 24/7 and the people there couldn't be nicer...they truly understand the concept of customer service. They want you to enjoy your stay; not only in their hotel but in their city as well. Restaurant recommendations, metro routes, anything; just ASK and they burst forth with information. Example: Tired of the sightseeing crowds, upon returning to the hotel one afternoon, I said as much and asked Ludivine (who is absolutely stellar!) to recommend a neighborhood we could just wander around in the next day. Well, she gave us a map and said we would like the Promenade of Plants (I think that's what the translation is). We spent most of the next day walking the neighborhood and discovering this wonderfull park that goes on forever and certainly wasn't in the guide book. That walk and the Musee D'Orsay were my favorite Paris 'to do's\" of the entire visit. (Merci, Ludivine!) The Hotel is located on a main boulevard. The wide sidewalks are lined with businesses and cafes, and patisseries abound alongside ATMs and pharmacies. (Please do try Cafe Bonal one block up the street toward Nation station. The English there is limited but quite sufficient, the food very good, prices reasonable, staff friendly and helpful; all in all, a nice place to have a bite or a glass of wine or beer and just enjoy the neighborhood.) Close by are two metro stations, one of which is a major hub. Traveling by Metro is easy to do and the staff at the hotel desk can explain it if you have any questions. We found buying a \"carnet\" of tickets (10 tickets) as needed worked the best for us but you may want a metro pass. Taking Zyad's advice (I believe he is the manager and who also advised my husband about returning to the airport and then made the arrangements for us), we bought tickets for the BAtobus which travels up and down the Seine with on-and-off privileges. From the BAtobus stops you can visit the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, Musee D'Orsay, the Louvre, etc. Would highly recommend this vs the expensive dinner cruises. Oh, the breakfast at the hotel is varied: meats, cheeses, croissants, rolls, toast, eggs to be boiled, coffee, tea, juices, cereals, yogurt cups. Patience (the woman who takes care of both the breakfast room and you) keeps it well stocked so that it doesn't matter what time you come down to eat, nothing has \"run out\". (Another example of the great staff: On our last morning there we needed to check out before breakfast started and the young man at the desk went down and brought up croissants/rolls and orange juice for us and offered to make us coffee. When I asked for some napkins to wrap up a couple of croissants in, he went back downstairs and brought back another two already tucked into the napkins.) So, did I mention how GREAT the staff is? You can not come or go without being greeted by them. And I mean in a sincere way (as opposed to a \"want fries with that\" way). My husband mentioned I wasn't feeling well one day. The next day when we passed the desk, they asked after my health. On another occasion after getting metro directions to Monmarte, they inquired about our trip when we returned much later that day. It was that way during the entire stay and no, we weren't their only guests nor did we stand out... I noticed them treating/speaking to all the guests that way. One last mention. If you come across a free public toilet booth/kiosk along the sidewalk don't be afraid to enter. It is completely automated and is sanitized after each use. ( No latrine smell!) During our stay we came across four different ones that we used. All were clean and, thankfully, stocked with toilet paper.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tehran", "Title": "\u201cIt was alright...\u201d", "Author": "Amiralij", "ReviewID": "UR116548715", "Content": "We stayed at Grand Hotel Francais for 3 nights.

We enjoyed the complimentary chocolates and red wine, the bar fridge, comfortable bedding, and the large shower head in the bathroom. We were also able to connect with family members without a problem on the internet back in Canada. An important travel bonus is the close proximity to the Paris metro, particularly the Nation station, where we could go to places like the Pere Lachaise cemetery, the Louvre, the Arc de Triomphe, etc., etc., in less than a half an hour. The hotel is located in the 11th district, which is not in the centre of Paris. However, it is fascinating to watch the locals pick up their food in this area, (the boulangeries are amazing!) One last thing to mention is that the hotel does offer breakfast for 12 Euros, which includes dell meats, cheeses, fruit, toast, yogurt, croissants, etc. You also have a choice of cafe noir, or cafe au lait.

There are closeby subway stations and since the Paris underground is so well-developed, it was very very easy to get anywhere we wanted quickly and smoothly. Subway is definitely the way to get around Paris. There is not really anything to see or do and not much to eat very near the hotel, so expect to only be in the area to sleep and rest. The only thing we weren't too excited about was the breakfast option. It is served in a tiny room in the basement and it is quite expensive.

Breakfast in the small basement room was extremely run and had a reasonable range of food (in a French context...this would not score well on an international scale but it was much better than simply croissants and coffee).

I emailed the hotel several times with questions and was promptly answered by a friendly staff member each time. We booked several months in advance but were told a balcony was not available, however when we checked in we were told we had been upgraded to a double balcony suite. Like every hotel room in Paris, the rooms at the Grand Hotel Francias are small yet very nicely decorated. On our bed awaited a welcome note, two small bottles of wine and chocolate, a very nice touch! After settling in we noticed our room felt very warm. We happened to be in Paris during a massive heat wave, temperatures spiked over 40 degrees C. The first night in our room was spent waking up several times to douse ourselves in water. We notified the front desk of the uncomfortable temperature level in our room and were told that they had just installed a new air conditioning system, they checked the breaker box on the main level and assured us the system seemed to be running normal but called a repair man just in case. Unfortunately, due to the rare heat wave, a repair man was not available anytime soon. The next two nights, with temperatures rising even higher, our room became almost unbearable. On the third morning we went to talk to the front desk again, upon greeting us, at first, the gentleman met us with marked hostility. Without really letting me get a word in, he informed my husband and I of the following: 1.) They had never had a complaint about the AC system from our room (which is not surprising as we were there during a rare heat wave) 2.) They just installed this new AC system. 3.) His Dr. told him he shouldn't be working in his profession anymore because of the high stress levels. 4.) He would refund us for the previous night 5.) We were welcome to move to another room. All of this as he was dialing the repairman again and banged the phone down in duress. At no time were my husband and I ever mad or upset with this man, in fact we felt bad for him, it was obvious he was extremely stressed and had all sorts of job pressure. My husband and I informed the gentleman that we were not trying to cause any problems, and were not looking for any refunds. We simply wanted to see if we could walk into another room in the hotel to feel its temperature and see if this problem was just in our room, or if every room in the hotel felt that hot. He promptly walked us up to a room on the first floor, as soon as we walked in we were welcomed with a rush of cool air, it was clear our room had a faulty AC unit. We jumped at the chance to move to this room. Later that night upon returning to our new room a note waited for us on the bed informing us that the hotel had refunded our ENTIRE stay with them for our inconvenience. My husband and I were absolutely blown away. At no time did we ever request or expect and type of a refund. The hotel completely took it upon themselves to go above and beyond to correct this problem. My husband immediately walked downstairs and shook the gentleman and to front desks hand to thank him. I would recommend this hotel 100 x\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over to anyone. Any hotel that would take such drastic measures to correct their guest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems is worht its weight in gold! On another note, the hotel is slightly out of the main areas but there were two metro stops easily within walking distance.

There was ample closet and cupboard space and the bed was very comfortable. There is free WIFI and the phone call we made home was reasonably priced. Our room was back from the street and very quiet. The nicely appointed breakfast room is downstairs and they have an elevator or winding staircase between levels. The tables were set each morning and they served a quality orange juice, cereal, pastries, fresh fruit salad, yogourt and cheese and meats. We were very happy with the breakfast and a lady was there to assist you and bring hot drinks to the table. When I asked about laundry services, we were told to give our laundry to the woman who looked after breakfast and our clothes were clean and folded on our bed when we returned at the end of the day. There was no cost for the service and we were happy to tip her for doing this task and allowing us more time to visit Paris! The hotel is in a busy neighbourhood and there are lots of little shops, food stores and restaurants in the area. We were able to get some idea about how the people of Paris lived. We met some of the other guests and found out they had picked the hotel because of the reviews on TripAdvisor. Although we needed to use the metro each day to take us to the tourist venues, we were happy to have selected this hotel. The desk staff is very helpful with travel plans, selecting restaurants, etc. The young lady who worked at the desk, even mailed my postcards for me on her way home from work. There were many little personal touches that made this a good choice for us.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cSecond time is even better\u201d", "Author": "monkeyFUZ", "ReviewID": "UR112321119", "Content": "Ok, So I can't say enough about this hotel.

The location of this hotel is not bad - not right in the heart of things, but less than half a block from a metro station, so getting around is not a problem. The building is beautiful on the outside, and modern and sophisticated on the inside. I would recommend this hotel. However, I would like to disclose some information so that travelers are aware. Breakfast is included, but coffee is NOT. And it is like $2 a cup, no refills. Not awful, but not what some might be used to [like Free coffee - all day long!! Or at least refills!!]. Americans, we are used to hotels with large rooms and amenities galore. This is not such a hotel. This is a historic building which has been renovated beautifully, but the rooms are very, VERY small. I am 5 feet tall, and even I found them small. The shower stalls are teensy-weensy, to the point where I [at 5 feet tall, mind you!] was knocking my elbows at every turn. My 5'11\" husband managed okay, but he is skinny and agile. Anyone overweight would have serious issues with the showers. The blowdryers are very weak - bring your own. Also, note that, late at night when the streets are quiet but the metro is still running, you can hear the metro rumbling underground. The sound is not loud, it is subtle, but it is there. Note that they do not provide irons. I made the clerk upset by requesting one and, when he said they did not provide them but did provide ironing on request, I inquired why. Basically, it's a fire hazard and some people didn't turn them off. Though I understand this, it is not in my nature [middle-class American] to have other people iron my clothes and I certainly did not want to have to tip someone to do something I would happily have done myself. I went along with it and did not tip. We were on a budget, and to me, an iron is a very basic amenity. At any rate, the night before checkout, the clerk kindly helped me print out our boarding passes, but for some reason there was a problem with one and I had to try again the next morning right before leaving. The next morning, there was a new clerk, one I hadn't seen on our 5 day trip, and he was pretty huffy about my request to try to print our other boarding pass. Instead of looking it up on the super-speedy desk computer the clerk was using, he handed me a very old laptop and plug. He did not tell me where to plug in, etc. He did not apologize for not helping me, nor give me any information or pointers. I handed it back to him and said forget it.

We were so appreciative in being well taken care of from the start. The surrounding Avenue Voltaire has a number of cafes, bakeries, grocery store, pharmacy, ATM machines, Metro access, and small boutiques within a very, very short walking distance.

They are contemporary in design and very, very clean.

I read one review about \"homeless\" and \"dog poop\" on the sidewalk. Again, it's Paris! Ever been to New York? Not once did we feel intimidated, uncertain or scared. Far from it, we enjoyed the decidedly non-touristy feel of a true Parisian neighborhood. If you want the plastic tourist stuff , I'm sure you can find it elsewhere in Paris and at a much higher price. Whether you need the Metro or a bus, everything is very close.

This place defies nearly every stereotype that I can think of about Paris hotels! The staff are amazingly friendly. In a Parisian hotel less than 200 Euro per night, I usually expect staff that grunt when you come & go and get very annoyed if you come back late at night and expect to be let into the hotel. All the staff here were quick to greet us and the guy on reception at night wasn't annoyed that we came in late - he even offered us a coffee! The shower here was better than expected. I've stayed in hotels in Paris with little or no hot water and a trickle of water disguised as a shower. The shower here was hot & had good water pressure. We were in one of the smaller rooms and had only a shower, not a bath but the shower was fantastic so we never noticed the lack of bath. This hotel not only has a WIFI connection that worked every time we logged in - it was included in the room price! A great selling point for a hotel in ant big city. Breakfast was served until 10.30 - later than lots of other places I've stayed. The food was standard continental - breads, cheese, cold meats, cereal, yogurt, fruit. Everything was fresh and was replenished as needed. The sheet of local restaurant recommendations from the Hotel is good as well. Le Petit Panisse has great food and was good value for money. Not sure if they have menus in English though! This was on the hotel's list of recommendations and our friends who live in Paris knew it and booked a table. We didn't want to stay in the heart of tourist land and this location was great in that respect. Nearest metro was over the road - about 1 minute walk. About 5 minutes in either direction you could get to either Nation or Faidherbe Chaligny metro stations - it took us about 20 minutes to FDR metro station for the Champs-Elysee so it's easy to find the tourist spots if you want them. The worst thing I can say - not that it's bad - is that the room was small. Paris is notorious for small rooms and this is the one stereotype that applies here.

Overall, I am extremely pleased with my stay. The hotels is located about 50 meters from the Rue des Boulets metro stop in an untouristy, everyday part of Paris. Although the double-bedded room I had was tres petite (and I do mean very small), it was clean and had modern furnishings and decorations. But what sets this hotel apart is its customer service. When I requested at the front desk about the location of a laundertte, I was told to leave my laudry and that the staff would wash it while they were washing the sheets and towels. I figured that the charges would be added to my bill, so I left it and headed out for a day of shopping and walking around town. When I returned that evening, I found my clothes neatly folded on top of the bed in my room. Later that evening, the front desk manager asked if my laundry was acceptable, and when I enquired as to the charge for the service, he informed my that it was free. I was pleasantly surprised by this, and amazed by the level of service I received. The next day, a colleague told me that the charges for his laundry service (a similar amount of clothes) at the airport Hyatt came to 160 Euros! The service at breakfast was similar. Each morning, the ladies in the breakfast room asked several times what I needed. The price for all of this service was very reasonable: 130 Euros per night including breakfast.

As an added bonus, there were slippers in the room, which was nice for us as we don't normally like walking around in our socks, nor do we like walking barefoot on bathroom floors generally. Also, the staff were very accomodating when we needed to print out our boarding passes (and even when I asked that they delete all of our files afterwards to protect our personal information and the like).

I arrived at the hotel at about 1800 and was warmly welcomed by the lady on reception and the check in was swift and efficient. My room - 115 on the first floor was compact but more than adequate and the ensuite shower room was very well appointed. The room was exceptionally clean and throughout my stay was cleaned daily to a very good standard. The shower in the ensuite was particularly good - powerful and ample hot water throughout the day. The bed was very comfortable and I had four uninterrupted nights sleep. The mini bar fridge was appreciated, as was the safe - a very good size, large enough for laptop and all my valuables. I would have appreciated a kettle and complimentary tea and coffee - bit a minor point. The hotel's location is noticeably quiet for a city location. The only audible noise, which at worst was intermittent, was of traffic, but to be expected in a city hotel and I did not find it intrusive, resulting in a good nights sleep on all four nights. The hotel is situated out of the city centre but the walk into the city is on the level, pleasant and can be made varied passing sights of interest on all the routes I took. I passed through some interesting cosmopolitan districts and it's about 45 minutes at a gentle pace. Alternatively the Metro is accessible from two stations; Rue de Boulets, serving just one line is a 3 minute walk from the hotel and Nation less than a 10 minute walk, serving a selection of lines. I would recommend taking the Metro as opposed to taxis as the roads are often gridlocked. The Metro was never too busy , always clean and I preferred the experience to the London Underground. The staff in the hotel are excellent and no request was too much trouble and without doubt is a particular credit to the hotel, especially if your French or knowledge of the city is lacking. Staff speak fluent English. I didn't take breakfast for no other reason than I wanted to explore Paris and its many culinary treats. In summary, the hotel is an excellent choice for exploring all of Paris and I think I'd be challenged to find a similarly priced hotel offering the same level of service and comfort.

The Hotel was clean from top to bottom and there was not one moment of disappointment from the lobby to our room to even the basement where a lovely breakfast is served each morning. We opted for a slightly larger room than the standard at a reasonable additional cost I think of just $20 which gave us a little more room to lay our bags and made us feel like we were not staying in a closet which sometimes is the case in European hotels from our experience; we enjoy much larger accommodations State side. We enjoyed a very firm queen size bed and a full shower which also sometimes not to be expected in Europe.

I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone for any reason.

Before I arrived, as I was planning to celebrate my wifes birthday and had several other questions, I contacted the hotel by telephone and email. In the first instance whoever I spoke to on the Reception Team were extremely helpful, courteous, knowledgable and spoke excellent English. Nothing was too much trouble and I patted myself on the back for finding this hotel! When we finally arrived late Friday Evening, we were greeted by name handed a registration card to complete and our room card. We were asked if there was anything else we needed and it wasn't just a standard question, it was a real desire to 'serve' and very refreshing in a world where today service is considered a chore rather than a pleasure. Further to previous reviews, and as is quite the norm in Paris, we were warned the rooms were small. I am 6'3'' and 17 stone and when I first stepped into the room I felt a bit like Gulliver in Lilliput!! However after a long days travelling we settled down and enjoyed a peaceful nights rest. Although we were next to the lift (Room 44 on the 4th floor) there was absolutely no discernable mechanical noise, or any street noise throughout our stay. The next morning when we unpacked our bags it was very noticeable a lot of thought had gone into the design and furnishing of the room and bathroom to fit a lot into a litle space and we re-named it compact, not small! If there was one criticism it would be it would be the room was too warm unless the AC was switched off (which I did and it was then fine). Breakfast is served in the basement and offers a selection of cereals, breads, pastries, cold meats, cheese, yoghurts, fruit juices, teas, coffee and fresh fruit salad all served buffet style other than the drinks brought to you by very pleasant, smiling staff. When we were ready to hit the sight seeing trail with our Paris Visite Travel Cards (Essential and teriffic value purchaseable in advance which I recommend doing) the desk manager quickly pointed out the simplest way of getting there. The Metro is easy to use and the Rue Du Boulets (Line 9) station is a minutes walk from the Hotel Entrance which, can, if you wish, get you direct to the Eiffel Tower in about 20 minutes or so. A 5-10 minute walk away (or about a minute from the Rue Du Boulet station by Metro) is Nation Terminal which gets you anywhere by Metro or RER including CDG Airport (we had booked a shuttle from the airport but next time in Paris we will use the train and metro, it is quicker, easier (if you only have light luggage) and infinitely cheaper (8.5 Euros per person each way). Real plus points if you want to spend your last day touring is that the hotel offer a left luggage facility which is free of charge, which you can return to after you have seen some more of the city and collect before you leave for home. I had developed such a deep trust of the staff by the end of my first 24 hours of staying at this hotel that I left everything from Passports, to Jewellery to Boarding Passes and my wallet including cash and cards in an unlocked case which I would NEVER normally consider doing! Overall if you want a super little hotel to stay in whilst visiting Paris for a few days, look no farther than the Grand Hotel Francais, but due to the size of the rooms, cleverly designed that they are, I would probably say 5 days is max. If the hotel staff read this review I would like to say a big, big thank you to everyone especially front of house for a lovely stay- we will definitely return!

If you are anything like my husband and I, this will not matter to you at all, as the hotel room really only serves us as a place to crash at night. We really don't like to spend too much time in our hotel room because we're always out seeing the sights. The room has all that we really needed- a mini-fridge, a desk, a very comfortable bed, a little bit of storage for our clothes and stuff, and a clean, beautifully done-up private bathroom, with a toilet, sink, and tub/shower combo. Floor space- not so much! We had signed up for a deal where we got breakfast included in our rate. Although I would definitely stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat, the breakfast there is not something I'd do again. The quality of the food left something to be desired- not that it was bad, it was certainly edible and okay... it's just that in Paris you really want to be taking advantage of the amazing cuisine at every possible opportunity, and this stuff just tasted... store bought? Fake? I dunno, just not good. Next time I will forgo the meal there and pick up something at one of the many little places nearby instead. (Plus they serve the meal in the basement- a little depressing.) Another thing worth mentioning is the location of this hotel. It is a little bit out of the city center, but there is a subway stop seconds away from the doors, so it is not really an issue. In about 15 minutes or so, you can be right down where all the action is (ie: Notre Dame, Louvre, etc.) The staff are also very friendly and helpful! They spoke English, but were also very supportive of our efforts to scape by with our high-school level French skills! They even gave us some mini French lessons before we went out for the day to help us get around better! Everyday that we came downstairs to leave, they'd ask if we needed anything before we left (directions, maps, etc.) and if we did, they would thoroughly explain everything we needed, even giving us a map and drawing on it for us. Whenever we came back at night, they would give us a warm greeting, and make us feel very at home. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be as close to the action in Paris as possible without spending a fortune. Summary: Good Value, small yet comfortable room with all ammenities, mediocre breakfast, friendly, helpful staff, semi-convenient, quiet location.

The closet was very tiny. There was no ironing board in the room, and they don't even have any at all in the hotel to lend. The elevator in the hotel is very slow.

It was my first trip to Paris and we'd done extensive research on hotels in the city before finally deciding to book with GHF. Let me say this about that: It was fantastic. First off - our room was fabulous. Disregard room reviews that complain about the size; I think it is more a function of what people in the U.S. are used to, not a genuine reflection of space. Our room was not a closet, it was not cramped, it was LOVELY. I am finicky about rooms and don't like scratchy linens or places that have a funny smell. No worries - it was clean, it smelled clean, it looked luxe and beautiful. When we return, we want to stay here again. Second - the daytime manager at the desk deserves his reputation as a helpful, gregarious, English Speaking charmer. He was great to deal with. The evening staff, while less outgoing, was no less helpful or pleasant to deal with. Their English is wonderful and you never feel like a nuisance coming to them for help or with questions. Third - Breakfast was really delightful. Fresh croissants, pain du chocolat, juices, tea, coffee, cereal, yogurt, fruit, cheese, meats (ham and salami) were plentiful and of excellent quality. Even the room itself - a little nook - is charming in its simplicity, the china is cheerful, the silverware and glasses gleam, and the whole affair is spotless and relaxed. The hotel is impeccably tidy and fresh. I did not find a single spot where it smelled musty or mildewed or stale, there was absolutely no dust anywhere, and everything worked as it should . The lift WAS tiny, but it worked smoothly, and there was room in it for us, our luggage, and another person, so no complaints there either. The (free) wifi worked wonderfully and consistently, which is patently not true of other places offering free wifi. The shower didn't have powerful water pressure, but the shower heads are great, and the volume of hot water was wonderful. Unlike a lot of cities (New York, Boston) , the water has no funky, chlorinated odor. The amenities (shower gel & hand soap) smelled good; and you get a loofah, plus slippers to keep. Even the toilet paper was significantly better than the shiny, super thin stuff you find in most places. The bed was fantastic, a thick, firm mattress with a dense, lush duvet , and two pillows. We both suffer from back problems and have difficulty with inferior mattresses, but we both slept like logs and woke up free from backache. The television worked, the wardrobe was spacious, the draperies were heavy and wonderful at blocking light / noise, and the sheers behind the drapes were wonderful for privacy but allowing lots of light to flood the room. The walls appear to be soundproofed and while you can hear people moving around, there was no noticeable sound of toilets, showers, voices, etc.. I wish the hotel were somewhat more central. It is the only thing I found myself wishing were a little better, but in the big picture, it didn't matter. The hotel was a wonderful, comfortable haven for us at the end of our days in Paris, and as I said before, we will definitely be back. Regarding location - the hotel is a matter of yards away from the Metro stop \"Rue du Boulets\", and a short walk from the stop \"Nation\". (I preferred using Rue du Boulets, but that is because it was a shorter walk and my feet hurt.) The neighborhood is delightful and genuine. Everyone we met was cheerful and pleasant. I spoke tentative, nervous French and most people answered me in English or very understandable language. Most people do, in fact, speak English but won't admit it until you've tried your hand at French. The manager at the GHF desk will give you a map of recommended restaurants and wine bars in the area, which was helpful. We ate at one of these, and it was reasonably pleasant. (Be advised - lots of places do not take Visa / MC.) There are a couple of Boulangeries in the road, one of which served us delicious baguettes and another served the most gorgeous pastry / confections I've ever had in my life. Just writing this has made me long to return. When we do, you can be sure we'll be staying at Grand Hotel Francais.

Having read all the other reviews, they are pretty accurate, and from these I kind of knew what to expect.

But they are very well finished with nice furniture and spotlessly clean. (Try poking the ceiling, it's made from a very interesting rubber material which makes it like jelly to touch!) We stayed in room 13, which was on 1st floor on the front corner of the building. The road outside was acually quite noisy (those Parisians sure love their car horns!!), even with the windows close you can here some street noise, this quietens down at night (may be quieter at rear of hotel??). But as we weren't spending huge amounts of time in the room, this didn't really bother us, and it didn't stop us getting a good night's sleep. The bed is very comfy, which added to the good rest. Reading other reviews, people mentioned the breakfast could do with a mix-up. I thought that was people being fussy, but I now agree with them. It's nice and all, but after a few days it would be nice to have a slight change. (They have fruit, cereal, bread, cheese, cold meats, yoghurts, pastries). Toast would've been nice, just my preference though. The staff were pleasent. As mentioned, they all spoke good English, though a greeting in French always goes down well. Lots of people have commented how great the staff were- we didn't have that much to do with them so can't really comment on that. Our dealings with them were fine though, and they seemed friendly enough. Hotel well located for travel, Metro & RER station 'Nation' only few mins walk away. We got everywhere in Paris we needed to from this station. All in all, a well placed hotel, very nicely decorated, pleasant staff, VERY clean. Only thing I would remind you is that there was no kettle in the room (for all you brits who love your tea) and no restaurant, so if you want to eat or drink, you mainly need to go out.

I was particularly impressed with the service; Zyad the Manager lived up to his reputation as being very chatty, friendly and focused on guests' needs. He even offered to do our laundry for us free of charge so that we could spend our time in more pleasant ways. The hotel is not in the touristy area which is fine with me as eating out and buying a few groceries tended to be cheaper. It's very handy to the Nation metro station which is linked to virtually all the major attractions. The only complaint we had was regarding the breakfast. We had 5 breakfasts at the hotel and there is no variety. It would be nice to change one or more aspects of the breakfast every 2 or 3 days so that boredom does not set in. For instance the type of pastries, cheeses, fruit or cold meats offered could be varied.

Recently renovated, the rooms are furnished with good quality linens, comfortable beds, flat screen television and a modern aesthetic, with clean lines and simple furniture. All rooms are equipped with clean, modern shower facilities, with an option to upgrade to suite rooms with bath tubs. Check in went smoothly and the concierge was very helpful when it came to recommending local spots for groceries, breakfast or meals. We had no problems with our reservations being honored; however if you book a double room as a single occupancy, there will be an additional EUR20 charge if you want to change that to a double occupancy. The manager and staff are bi-lingual and go out of their way to help guests. The Grande Francais is not located within central Paris, but is a little further off the tourist track in the 11e, or 11th arrondissement. This adds to the local flavor of the neighborhood. There are numerous shops dotted around the streets and visitors can easily buy cold cuts, fresh baguettes or fruit. The breakfast offered, like most of Europe, is Continental-style and consists of pastries, bread, jams, coffee, tea and fruit. The food was adequate for the price charged. For a more authentic Parisien experience, eschew the hotel provided breakfast and hit the streets of Paris for a breakfast of croissants and coffee in a cafe instead. Unlike larger chain hotels, the Grande Francais does not have many amenities, such as a fitness centre or conference rooms. Guests are allowed to use the gym and pool of another nearby hotel for a fee of EUR20. There are also non of the vending or ice machines normally found dotted in the corridors of American hotels, though it is easy and convenient to pop down to the nearby shops for any items you require. Parisien hotels are infamous for their high prices, small sizes and not always clean rooms. For a comfortable, safe and clean space to rest your feet after a full day of sight seeing in Paris, the Grande Francais is a good choice for both business and leisure travelers. Prices are reasonable by Paris standards. The Grande Francais represents good value, tastefully decorated and comfortable rooms in an accessible location.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful small hotel with AMAZING service at GREAT price!\u201d", "Author": "kmp222", "ReviewID": "UR82342177", "Content": "Wow! Where to begin... It was our honeymoon trip - 2 days in Paris, 4 days in Rome and the beau planned it in its entirety. A big THANKS to all on Trip Advisor for rating this hotel high enough for my hubby to choose this spot! After a long flight from San Francisco, we were exhausted and feeling a little delirious when we arrived. Though we had to wait a few minutes for our room to be ready, the incredibly humorous and overwhelmingly knowledgeable front desk gentleman was ever so gracious to jump behind their quaint little bar and pour me a glass of wine and my hubby a scotch. We were extremely excited once we arrived in our room - let me be clear, if you've done any research then you know Paris has small rooms, so it was no surprise, but the room was super clean and had an efficient use of the space provided. Not to mention the most adorable little patio - ask for a room on the top floors if possible so you can appreciate this beauty. Though most of our trip was planned, the concierge gentleman previously mentioned was such a tremendous help to us; he provided directions to the nearest metro, recommendations for a quick glass of wine and fromage, helped us to correctly pronounce certain words/phrases... all in all, he was phenomenal! He played a HUGE part in making our stay in Paris so perfect. I could not thank him enough for his assistance... I'm sorry I forgot his name - but he speaks like 5 different languages and brown curly hair with glasses. (This is so he get's credit for being an outstanding employee!) =) The hotel is in a great location; Voltaire is lined with amazing brasseries and cafes and you can easily walk to the metro, some great little shops. Two small flaws - almost not worth mentioning, but I will for those that are neurotic like I am... 1) The website says they have a fitness room. They do not. Instead, they guide you to the ClubMed gym which is about a 5-8 minute walk from the hotel. I got a little lost trying to find the place, but when I finally did I was surprised to learn that you have to pay 20 euros to get in, which I was unprepared for. Thankfully, the women at the gym were sympathetic and let me work out for free. I only mention this as a \"flaw\" as I am gym rat, so I work out everyday (yes, even on my honeymoon), so I had insisted we stay at a hotel with a gym and unfortunately, I feel this was misrepresented. 2) The housecleaning was great - except for un-deliberately ruining my new straw hat from Banana Republic. When we left one morning I had my hat on top of my suitcase. When we came back at the end of the day, my hat was squished between my suitcase and the wall. When they were cleaning they must have moved things around and in the process my hat became lodged in that position. Sadly, because it's paper/straw the sit/style of the hat was now ruined and it can not be reshaped to its original form. SO, there goes $40. After all is said and done, it was a superb hotel with the most welcoming and informative customer service ever. I would definitely recommend to anyone!", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, NY", "Title": "\u201cPetite Hotel, Grande Enjoyment\u201d", "Author": "steven424", "ReviewID": "UR81982964", "Content": "My wife chose this hotel based on the reviews in Trip Adviser, and it certainly lived up to its reputation. We were originally booked for the end of April but had to cancel due to the Iceland volcanic activity. Hotel management graciously allowed us to rebook at our original price without any restrictions. This set the tone for our stay. The hotel is located about 2mi due east from center city (Notre Dame) on a main but quiet tree-lined street a few blocks NW of Place de la Nation. This actually worked to our benefit because at night there was little or no vehicle traffic, and it was very quiet. Other tourists we met who stayed closer to the center city encountered evening noise issues. We were a little concerned about not being in the \"middle of things\" but after a day on the Metro our concerns evaporated. Hotel to the M9 metro station was a 5 minute stroll. As Brooklynites we were impressed with the whole Metro system and the extensive coverage and interconnection of all the lines. As you walk to the station you pass more patisseries than any area has a right to have. At one point we needed an eclair intervention. More about location. Being in the suburbs, the area is definitely not \"24x7\". The restaurants and shops in the immediate vicinity kept hours we could not reliably figure out. The small supermarket across the street was closed more of the 8 days we were there than it was open. This might have been due to the close succession of Jewish holidays (the supermarket had a large variety of kosher foods), but we were never sure. If you are like us and prefer to eat in instead of doing the restaurant thing every evening, the solution is to walk to the Casino Supermarche located at the Place de la Nation (a 10 minute walk). Stock up on the basics, which you can store in the mini-fridge in your room. This is also helpful if you get late night snack-attacks, since the hotel does not have any vending machines or convenience shops. The hotel itself is very much as others have described it. 6 floors, 3-4 rooms per floor. Small elevator with an over-sensitive leveling systems that caused it to bounce as people got on and off. The rooms are small by US standards, but very comfortable by European standards. The bed, pillows, and comforter are to die for (one of the best sleeps we've had anywhere). Bathrooms are very clean, modern, small, and have great showers. Ample clothing storage unless you are going formal every night. Modern heat/AC controls, but be aware of French conservation regulations. The evenings were chilly (low-mid 50's), but the hotel was not permitted to turn the heat on until the middle of October. Did I mention that the comforter was to die for? The same is probably true for the AC toward the end of Spring. Free WiFi, which allowed me to use my netbook and smartphone without roaming charges. Free mini-safe for valuables like jewelry and passports. One of the best parts of our stay was the breakfast room. Well stocked with freshly baked croissants and other breads and rolls, spreads, orange and apple juice, fresh fruit cocktail, yogurt, and sliced meats. Coffee and hot chocolate on request. If you are planning any sort of activity such as long walks, you must definitely eat breakfast. We were able to go for long stretches without food breaks because of this initial nourishment. The staff is very friendly and courteous, and very fluent in English. When we arrived there was a mix-up with our accommodations. The person on the main desk at the time, Zyad, went out of his way to make things right. Way out of his way... We figured out after a few days that he was a French version of John Cleese in Fawlty Towers. Dry, deadpan wit. If he says he will have to quit the hotel industry and leave the country because of some minor problem you bring to his attention, play along. Would we stay there again? In an instant. Between the location, the staff, the comforts, and the breakfast room, it was one of the nicest vacations we've had. We cannot guarantee you will have the same level of enjoyment we did, but you can be sure Zyad and the rest will try to make it right.

First off is Zyad. I have seen other reviews that refer to him as the owner, and if so, it definitely shows. The guy's on top of his game. You'd imagine him as the ultimate concierge at five star hotel. When I booked the hotel, I emailed to ensure that the room would be appropriate and quickly got a return email that another room would be better suited to me; QED on arrival. When I needed clothes laundered and missed my alarm; no problem, taken care of. When I needed clothes due to a wardrobe malfunction; monsieur, no problem. Amazing. Best front desk man ever! Not only that, the guy's funny. When I asked if I should keep my laptop in my room due to security reasons, the maid standing by the front desk looked at me, and Zyad looked at her and said as a parent scolding a child, \"OK now, please do not steal the Monsieur's laptop!\" Playful, mocking way, that was quite perfect. Second is 11th Arr. I have a good friend in Paris and asked what place I should see off the tourist destinations. His response was instantly - \"Go to the 11th Arr.\" He was right. It's not downtown, not close to the major attractions, but what are you going to Paris for? More pics and tourist traps, or a real feel for a very real city that is simply beautiful in a number of ways (and a few not, like every corner being a fire hydrant for drunkards). The nearby p\u00c3\u00a2tisserie was great for fresh baguettes and other baked goods. The nearby Metro station \"Nation\" takes you to all the major stops. The smell of the roasting chickens at the boucherie was fantastic... I could go on, but stay and find out. Third, and last is the price. What kind of fool stays for 3x the price elsewhere when s/he can be treated like a king at the Grand Hotel Francais. Yes, if you insist on not travelling by foot, bus, scooter, rental bike or taxi, but only Metro, you have to be in by 12:30a.

When we booked in we were upgraded to a superior room. This was actually our last stop on our mini Euro-trip. The rooms were smaller than the other hotels we stayed at on our trip. The breakfast could have been better, we had better at our other hotels. It was included in our package so we went to have coffee and just some cereal. We picked this hotel because of the reviews. The service was one of the best. The rooms small but clean. I must say that I had the best night sleep at this hotel. I felt very comfortable asking questions. Whatever I asked I always got more than just my answer. Zyad is actually the owner of the hotel. He is there all day. He is very helpful along with his staff. He cares about his hotel, his staff and his guests. They also ironed my clothes and did my laundry(folded) for FREE. Wifi is also Free. We needed a charger for our IPod and they had that too. I think this hotel would be a 4 star hotel if the breakfast was better. I just feel there should be more options for breakfast if you are paying for it. Just had 2 kinds of cold meat, American coffee, 2 kinds of cereal, 4 or 5 kinds of Croissants, orange juice, apple juice, 3 kinds of cheese, and 2 kinds baguettes. Location wise, it was fine. The metro was really close. It wasn't right in the center of any sights but Bastille was about 20 min walk. We took the metro everywhere, and no matter where you are, if you want to see other sights you would prob have to take some type of transportation. Everything was easy to find. The metro lines we used were really good to get to anywhere we wanted. We took a cab from the train station for about 13 euros. The cab to the airport was about 40 euros since there was no traffic. My husband is a little more pickier than I am. He would prob want to stay closer to one of the popular sights but then we would prob pay more and get less for our money.

All these things are what makes a great hotel, but what makes this one of the BEST hotels is the staff. From the chambermaid to especially the front desk staff.

We wanted a quiet, clean and comfortable location. The room (although small as is standard in Paris), the service, and the assistance (staff spoke several languages, including English) provided by everyone at the hotel, was excellent. While it is true that the hotel is far from the major attractions (approx. 20-25 min. by metro-including walk or a taxi ride), it is just a block or two from two major metro stops. The neighborhood had a nearby market and restaurants, was safe and enjoyable, and was quiet at night with the windows closed. Why I loved this hotel and the wonderful service: 1) We arrived at the hotel before check-in in the morning and they were able to check us in within \u00c2\u00bd hour which was greatly appreciated after our 9 \u00c2\u00bd hour flight from Miami. During our wait, we were offered coffee which was very welcoming. 2) The rooms are wonderful. The room had a safe, mini fridge, extremely comfortable beds, was refurbished, and had a great bathtub and shower with plenty of hot water. The room even had its own thermostat which was helpful one hot day when we arrived after our tour and needed to cool down. Housekeeping is excellent as the rooms were always extremely clean when we returned and nothing was out of place. 3) Although I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read several reviews about the breakfast price of 10 Euros per person being high, I believe it to be fair as the hotel offers coffee, orange and apple juice, fruit salad, a variety of cheeses and ham, pastries/bread, 2 cereals and yogurt for that price. 4) The restaurant recommendations provided by the staff are excellent. We went twice to Vin e Merree (not sure of the correct spelling) and had a wonderful experience each time. If you like fish and/or seafood, it is an excellent restaurant within 2 blocks from the hotel with fresh food and reasonably priced for the quality and Paris standards. 5) The pizza restaurant next to the hotel is much better than it appears to be. The staff is warm and friendly and the food fresh, especially tiramisu (excuse my spelling) desert. In summary, I would highly recommend this hotel and will stay here again when visiting Paris.", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Topeka, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "Larry888", "ReviewID": "UR65403980", "Content": "My family and I stayed at the Hotel Francais (two superior rooms) for six nights in May of 2010.

Our room and bath/shower were very nice ... a bit small but no less so than most European hotels. Breakfast was more than adequate and well worth the extra cost. And the staff were very helpful.

They even made an extra effort to call the National Library for me to determine if a particular document (codex) was available for viewing or only to researchers.

However room size is standard for the city. the jacuzzi is a jetted bath tub but the roo is excelently furnished and came with a coplimentary bottle of chilled champange.

We wanted a special specific make of jewellery and were stuck as to where in te city we may find it. Zyad spent 30 minutes whilst balancing his working demands to locate a store which stocked it. Further to this his restaurant recomendations are excelent. Around the corner is a family run traditional restaurant called Gallopins which was reasonably priced and the quality, quantity and authenticty of the food and wine was second to none.

However, sitting on the toilet would be a challenge for anyone over 5 1/2 ft. tall because one's knees would hit the sink cabinet.

We stayed in Paris at this hotel for 4 nights after being in Amsterdam for 5 nights. This hotel, although a bit out of the way, with, as expected, small rooms, was extremely clean and well cared for. We made out way around on the Metro to and from the hotel very easily. The front desk staff at the hotel during our entire stay were very pleasant except for the last day. On the day that we were checking out, a fire alarm sounded, not once, but twice in the hotel. I could not reach the front desk for any information (no answer to several calls), nor did any staff member of the hotel try and contact the guests with information. I had just gotten out of the shower, and did not know what I should do. Without any information being disseminated by the hotel staff, after the second fire alarm, I quickly dressed and made my way down the 5 flights of stairs only to finally come upon a staff member who told me there was not a fire in the hotel. Upon check-out, I happened to ask the manager/owner if they did not have a way of contacting guests in the event of a fire alarm, and his temper just took off. He started yelling at me \"What can I say, we are a French hotel with bad service\" When I tried to calm him down and say that is not what I was saying, but just trying to tell him that it was frightening not to know what to do in the event of a fire alarm sounding twice, and no response from the hotel staff, he continued on with his tirade. He went on about how he had two children and had not had a holiday in 8 months, he had not taken a salary last month etc etc. When I asked him why he insinuated that I was saying it was a bad hotel with bad service, he told me that \"It was a joke\". Believe me when I say, there was nothing funny about how I was addressed as a guest of his hotel. He then told me that since I was so dissatisfied that he was going to refund the entire 4 night stay to my credit card. I told him that I was not looking for that, and did not expect not to pay for what was otherwise a fine stay. In fact I tried twice to dissuade him from doing so. At this point, he was more interested in continuing his tirade at me, as opposed to listening to what I was saying. A simple acknowledgment of my concerns was all that I was looking for - that being that it was frightening to be in the hotel room alone (my husband had gone out for coffee), and having nobody answer the phone at the front desk to let the guests know what was going on. Instead, my concerns, and what could have been helpful feedback in the event that the fire alarm was accidently sounded again, was dismissed with a credit of 500 Euros. The last words out of his mouth were, \"I've given you a credit, and you still are not happy - All I can do now is shoot myself in the head\" I did not speak to him rudely, not did I raise my voice once, even though he was yelling at me in front of another guest for what went on for 5 minutes.

His staff people are excellent...from the desk staff to the housekeeping, everyone was warm, friendly and professional. We worked the entire trip putting in very long days and were welcomed each evening like we were being welcomed home. The hotel had been renovated recently and is a beautiful, cozy French hotel. Everything is very modern but with an art deco feel. Loved the shower! The location is not right in the heart of old Paris, but the Metro is a quick walk in either direction. When we called for a taxi it was usually waiting before we even made it out of the elevator. There are plenty of wonderful places to eat right around the hotel. Si Zyad and his staff are well versed at what is in the area. As a small business owner I was happy to find and patronize a family run operation and not a big chain hotel.

The bed was extremely cozy. I never felt like the room was too small. It was really perfect for just me. The hotel is not near most of the sites, aside from P\u00c3\u00a8re Lachaise cemetary.

I thought it was truly perfect. The front desk clerks were amazing. They were happy to help me in any way I needed, and even though the friends that I travelled with did not stay at that hotel (except for one night), the hotel clerks graciously assisted my friends with all of their questions (which I thought was extremely kind of the hotel staff and very rude of my companions). Everyone spoke at least a little English, if not fluent English, which was very important since I do not speak French. The staff called a taxi when I needed one, they confirmed my shuttle to the airport, they answered questions about the metro and Paris in general, etc. The breakfast was also very nice.

The hotels near the city was kind of pricey and after much research on tripadvisor, we landed at Grand Hotel Francais. We're glad we found this hotel. We arrived early and the gentlemen at the front desk was really nice. He allowed us to leave our luggage at the hotel until check in was available (around 2:30PM). We toured around the area and came back a little early and the room was already ready for us. We forgot to purchase foreign adapters for our laptop and the hotel provided one for us for the stay... really nice of them~! The wireless connect would work fine in the morning and afternoon, but towards the evening we would lose connectivity quite often. The hotel is conveniently located near a metro stop (closest metro: Rue des Boulets) and within' walking distance are many restaurants. We've tried out several restaurants in the area and I have to say the Pizza place next to the hotel was the best. Right across the street is a grocery store, but many places around the area close around 7PM (as with everywhere else in Paris, except for restaurants). With a couple (1-2) of transfers, you can visit practically everywhere in Paris. We ended up getting the all day RATP metro pass (for about 5.90 Euros per person) and traveled almost everywhere in Paris. Be careful when you travel into the city, there will be lots of beggars and people trying to sell you stuff. Just say no and walk away and they will leave you alone. The hotel is clean, but really small. However, we figured most of our time will be spent touring around Paris, so the small room didn't bother us. We had a nice balcony view on the 5th floor. There is only one elevator for the hotel, which is really small as well. So if you're on the lower levels, I suggest taking the stairs (be careful b/c they're really narrow), instead of waiting for the elevator. Housekeeping did a great job maintaining our room. We never received a do not disturb sign, so housekeeping can range anywhere from 10AM or later. We also received free continental breakfast with our stay, which was great! They had a wide range of bread and cheese and some meat. They also had cereal, yogurt, juice and fruits. It was a great way to start off the day. Overall, we had a very pleasant stay at the hotel.

Finding a decent hotel in Paris under 150 Euro a night when you are a single traveler is nearly impossible therefore I was hooked on this hotel. I will start by the downside. The room are renovated therefore to standard you would expect for a 3 stars but VERY VERY small. Basically there is less then 1 metre around the double bed...so if there is 2 of you it is quickly \"small\" but for 1 or 2 nights its ok. The breakfast roomis underground...so if you feel clostrophobic well....don't have breakfast there. Now on the positive side, the hotel feels new (its has been totally renovated...and typical French style there is still some bits of the renovation left in the entrance hall,...why would you do that when you just did such a good job...) . The batroom are small but really nice and very modern. The wireless is great and powerfull and the breakfast is plenty. The entrance is also nice you can have a drink there or wait for people whilst consulting the internet (providing you have your own laptop obviously). As the room are so small its actually a nice place to use if you have a bit of time on your had waiting..... The hotel is also very convenient near the metro and the RER.

Loved the boutique hotel decor, location, breakfast, thoughtfully provided amenities and friendly staff. These guys have really thought of everything. Really enjoyed our stay here. Service Great service from Zyad the manager and the young lady with long blonde hair (Sorry i never asked her name) - very welcoming and accommodating, giving us maps and directions and being very responsive to any other needs (eg I needed to print out something, so the manager gave me a usb drive to put it on for printing on the hotel pc). Both were fluent in english and even tried helping me with my really bad french. It was our first trip to Paris and I had asked for a quiet room as well - not sure which helped, but we got upgraded to a superior room with a bathtub. Check-in and check-out were very quick and efficient. Room servicing was efficient and thorough - everything was always well done and bathroom always sparkling clean. The maids did seem to want to enter the room a couple of times after it had been cleaned - a bit strange, not sure why though as my french is pretty poor. Room We were in room 16 which is just up the stairs at the back of the hotel, overlooks a side street with view of the park. Decor was a nice change from all the floral bedspreads seen on nearly every other hotel in the same price range - contemporary decor (new) and a small but well-laid out room. Amenities included aircon, free wifi from room (with daily code from reception), fridge, phone, lcd tv, in-room safe (english channels were BBC and CNN). The aircon and welcome bottle of chilled water in the fridge were a huge plus for my partner after we lugged our bags from Nation station (it was at the end of summer). Room was a superior one with a bathroom - not sure if this makes the room bigger than a standard, but size was decent, didn't feel really cramped as was expecting for Paris (although there really is only space for one suitcase to be laid out). Lighting provided was a big plus for me as many hotels often have only lamps by the bed making reading difficult - but there was good overall room lighting, over the bed lighting (each side) as well as a lamp and wall lighting - lots of options. Also really liked the clever use of storage space and shelving, given the size of the room. Bed was a queen, extremely comfortable with crisp white sheets and a euro and standard pillow to choose from. Food isn't allowed in the room and there are no tea/coffee making facilities - I came prepared and brought my own kettle and teabags as I can't get by without my cuppa in the afternoon - hope that was ok, didn't get any comments on it. A fridge is provided, and you can optionally have it stocked by the hotel or use it to chill your own water or wine (1.5 l bottle of water is 70 centimes across the road at the supermarket). Everything was pretty new and all in perfect working order. Overall the room was great. The only problem we had was occasional noise from the next door north american guests (sorry, but we could hear their conversations and accents) who would sometimes have very loud and vocal discussions at strange hours of the night. Not the hotel's fault, just inconsiderate travellers (different lots of guests too). It wasn't annoying enough to call reception, but it did wake us up a couple of times. Bathroom Bathroom was lovely and sparklingly shiny and clean, although on the small side (as to be expected in Paris). All the standard amenities were available, and even slippers were provided. We had a bathtub room with shower. Watch out for the tiny gap between the glass door and the hinge - it can make a big puddle on the floor depending on where the showerhead is pointing (stuffing a bit of paper in the gap seemed to prevent this happening after the first time). Breakfast Breakfast was well catered for but agree that the 10 euro price might not be worth it if you haven't got it included in your rate, especially if there's more than one of you. Tip here would be, if there's 2 of you, check out the breakfast inclusive and exclusive rate when booking - the price difference might make it worthwhile to include breakfast as it is substantial and you can eat as much as you can manage - it's good, and you can sit down and take your time. My standard breakfast was cereal with fruit and yoghurt, croissant or roll with ham, salami and cheese, finished off with a couple of sweet pastries, washed down with a cup of tea and orange juice - pretty much a bit of everything, and all very good quality and tasty. The breakfast area can seat about 20 people - popular time seems to be around 9:30 to 10 when there were some people who had to wait, so maybe have breakfast early to get a good start on the day. Hotel Hotel decor is nice and contemporary, I think final renovations are still underway. There is a lift (thank goodness!) but it's small and a bit slow. We used the stairs anyway as we were on the first level. There's also a complimentary english newspaper available (The Guardian). Reception is manned 24 hours and is in a pretty safe-feeling area. Location Location was in 11th arrondisement but pretty close to Bastille and Marais, a little bit off the tourist map, but with such great access to the metros (Rue des Boulets is about 1 min walk, and Nation is about 8 mins) no complaints. The location also provided a more local feel, which is better than the tourist areas where you feel everyone's out to rip you off. Location also convenient for RER stop (Nation station) so good for Disneyland Paris. We did feel that we saw an awful lot of the metro service, but that might just be bad route planning on my part). (Tip - the Rue des Boulets metro stop is closer to hotel than Nation but there're still a few steps and walking to get to the correct station for the green line - tossup between negotiating crossing the roads and walking a couple of blocks, or the hassle of changing for one more stop). We bought the carnet of 10 tickets for 11.60 which I think works out cheaper than the 1 day pass which is 5.60 each for zone 1, depending on how much you want to do in a day. Eating Plenty of places to eat around the hotel - they have a list of recommended restaurants and a map and indicative price range. We tried the much-touted Les Galopins - loved it the first time but not so sure the second - 2nd time round, they seemed to be short-staffed that night and completely different staff and food not to the same standard (eg burnt creme brulee) - true test of a dish is ordering the same dish twice though!. We had a starters, mains, desserts and a 46cl bottle of wine - cost was around 60 - 70 euros for two of us. Note that some of the starters are large (eg the pate and the foie gras) so might be worth sharing these or having a 2nd starter instead of a main. I have to say I enjoyed the starters and desserts more than the mains. Also liked the italian place right next door (my partner had a hankering for pizza) who were also just as friendly and spoke english with amusing english menu, food is pretty reasonably priced and good here too. If you want to look further afield, then try the side streets. One night we didn't realise the time when we got back (around 10:15pm) and many places were already closed - we did find a pub called L'armagnac about 3 blocks up Blvd Voltaire and just off the corner on the left - this was still serving food although it is more pub style (eg served with french style chips and salad) but really nice local atmosphere and some of the staff there speak english. Other comments - We tried the shuttle service that the reception very kindly organised for us - again nothing to do with the hotel, but the guy was about 30 mins late, and then got lost trying to find his last pickup (unfortunately this involved going in circles around several tight corners and narrow streets in the Marais district, including side-swiping a parked car) but luckily we had checked in online already so weren't delayed too much. Reason for choosing this hotel Primary driver for a hotel in Paris for us was price, and photos and comments from other travellers - when I first started looking for a hotel, this one was ranked #79 on Trip Advisor, and now it's sitting at #18 out of over 1,900 hotels (over a period of about 6 months) - which says quite a bit in itself. The lift, aircon, wifi and location were an added bonus.

Having scoured Tripadvisor and read the reviews, for the budget we had this hotel seemed very much to fit the bill, and seeing as we secured the last available room for the time we were there, we figured it was a good choice. That proved to be an understatement as it lived up to, and indeed, surpassed expectations. Arrived mid afternoon to a friendly welcome and an immediate apology to the fact that work was going on to redecorate reception and install a new bar area. Lift up to our room to dump our bags and have a look around, found us with a very well appointed and clean room (yes, it was small, but in fact large for a 3 star Paris hotel) with 2 balconies looking over the Bvd, 3 complimentary waters waiting for us in the fridge and a note saying if we wanted the mini-bar filled to let reception know and they could advise on prices (we didn't take them up on the offer but it's a nice touch that you have a small fridge you can keep your own drinks in). A small safe for your belongings, flat-screen tv on the wall and a compact bathroom which was well-appointed with the most fantastic shower (and we've got a very good one at home as it is) we've ever had the pleasure to stand under. Slippers, clean fluffy towels and the usual complimentary toiletries. The hotel was literally 1 minute from the exit of Rue de Boulets Metro stop, and about 5 minutes from the Metro/RER hub station at Nation, so getting anywhere on public transport was a doddle - took us 20 minutes from Gare du Nord including changing lines at Oberkampf !. Most of the sights can be reached in anything from 10-20 minutes from the time you walk out of the door to the time you get off your Metro/RER train, but it's actually nice to walk - and we did a lot of that - walking to Notre Dame took us about 35 mins at a leisurely pace. The manager, Zyad, was tremendously helpful, making recommendations for places to eat locally, and when we asked him to make us a reservation at another Bistro for our last night in Paris he and his staff literally kept at it for nearly 24 hours until they managed to get through to the Bistro and get us a table - now that's Ritz level service at a 3 star price ! Could go on and on - but you'd get bored. We've travelled extensively, and my wife has been to Paris on a number of occasions before we met. We can be VERY critical of establishments if we feel we don't get the service or facilities we have paid for - but we cannot criticise this hotel at all. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel - just grabbed a coffee and croissant on the way to our morning destination - and anyway it's nice to sit at a brasserie watching the world go by as you have your petit dejuner. The room was always impeccibly cleaned during our stay, On checking out we were able to leave our luggage in the care of the hotel as we had a 6pm Eurostar booked back to England, and it allowed us to get a final bit of sightseeing/lunch in with the knowledge our belongings were being safely cared for. I never thought I'd enjoy Paris as much as I did - it was my first visit to the city in nearly over 30 years since I was a child, and I didn't know what to expect. I had a great time, and a large part of that was due to the fact we had such a great hotel with the most fantastic service, which meant the only \"fretting\" we had to do was where to eat ( and believe me - that CAN be a problem - as our guidebook said it's really hard to get a bad meal in Paris - so you are spoilt for choice on good food ! ). We had no plans to rush back to Paris - for me I thought it would be a nice trip and that's it - but even before we came back I was saying I want to go back - and if I can't stay at the Grand Francais, then we'll be timing our trip so we can - because we're not staying anywhere else in Paris !", "Date": "September 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Motherwell, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "cruisevirgin", "ReviewID": "UR41532100", "Content": "Only stayed one night but it was ideally situated and very clean and comfortable.

Zyad and his day staff are extemely helpful in every way, and had answers to all of our questions. He is extremely nice, and speaks perfect english! The room was small, but exactly what I expected, and the bed was super comfortable. The view from our room was very nice, and the room was also very quiet. I must say that the shower was fantastic with great water pressure, and tons of hot water. We also had a bath tub in our room which was also very nice for my girlfriend. The rooms were very clean, and offered a safe, and refridgerator in the room. Like everyone has said before, the location is wonderful with a great bakery, supermarket, and internet cafe all withing 100 yards. The metro was also within a few blocks in both directions and took only a few minutes to reach. The Metro station at Nation was best for us as it allowed us to travel to the entire city and return back to our hotel in no time at all. Breakfast was fresh and adequate, but if you are an American looking for eggs and bacon, you wont find it here. Just pasteries, fruit, and cold cuts and rolls, but also amazing coffee!!!

Many restaurants, bakeries, groceries store within minutes walk. We paid 115 euros/night . Free WiFi worked very well. AMAZING price/value! Would definitely go back and recommend this hotel to any one visiting Paris! A true gem! The metro system is the best way to visit Paris. Get a Paris Pass for Zone 1 as it is useless to get Zone 2 to 5 if you intend to stay within Paris. Eiffel Tower is worth the trip to the top but be there between 9-9:30 a.m. to avoid the lines. For lunch, grab a baguette ham/cheese sandwhich at many takeout places for 3-4 euros but if you sit at a table, price will double! Same thing for drinks.

OK, so if you have read a lot of reviews on hotels in Paris, we all know they're small, but the quality of the fixtures and fittings in our room was of a very high standard. The best sight was the room temperature control near the door for the air conditioning, which is something I didn't realise the rooms had and after a hot, humid trip from CDG airport on the train & metro to the hotel (which is very easy to get to from Rue de Beaulais metro station) was a blessing. There were three different receptionists on duty during our stay and each one was friendly and well informed on most aspects of Paris. If there was something they didn't know, they would find out for you. The breakfast is served in the basement between 7.30am and 10.30am and has a nice selection of pastries, cooked meats, cheese, cereals and a nice strong jug of coffee, which kept us going most of the day.

We had a laugh when one of the guests approached us and asked if our rooms were teenie, tiny as well.....she was from New York and I am sure was used to something much bigger. The elevator is very small and will probably only hold 4 people comfortably....taking the stairs was a challenge as they were making renovations and upgrades and the working staff was usually in the stairwell. Don't get me wrong......we would still recommend this hotel, as the ambiance is great. There is a small lounge just off the check-in desk where you can relax and have a drink. Our room had three windows, so plenty of light - with a little balcony out each window. The shower head looked brand new and was adjustable.....great showers! I can't say enough about the continental breakfast.....much more than you would expect. There was croissants, breads, cereal, yogurt, ham, different types of cheese, fresh fruit, milk, orange juice, tea or coffee. The young lady that served us our tea or coffee was very pleasant....always a smile on her face! This hotel is very close to the Metro (underground) in case you want to travel in that manner. We used it a few times to get around quickly. A tip for you....if you want to have a few drinks you are better off to go across the street to the small store (market) and buy beer for about 65 Euro Cents as you will pay dearly for beer at one of the bars (we paid 6 Euro each for a pint of beer).

After looking at LOTS of hotels in Paris on TripAdvisor we decided to go for the Hotel Grand Francais on the basis of it's reviews, after filtering all Paris hotels for ones under \u00c2\u00a3100 a night. The location is slightly out of the way (i.e. not in central Paris), but is right beside Rue de Boulets Metro Station and a 5 to 10 minute walk to Nation Station, which has 4 Metro lines and one RER line running through it. We ended up using 3 carnets of Metro tickets (10 in each Carnet for 11.40 Euros) in the 4 days we were there between us (including getting to and from the airport bus drop off station at Porte Maillot) and the journey into central Paris (even to the Eiffel Tower in West Paris) was no problem. The slightly out of the way location was certainly worth it in terms of the saving you would make over other hotels of a similar quality in the centre of the city. After an early flight from Glasgow we arrived at the hotel at around 11am. While we weren't able to check in we received a warm welcome from the very helpful receptionist and were able to leave our bags there and go off and see Notre Dame before coming back at 4pm and checking in. The room (no. 36) wasn't particularly big, but we were expecting this from the reviews we'd read and it is apparently a norm for most hotels in Paris. It was clean though, very nicely decorated and the bathroom was immaculate with a great shower. It was always warm, even though it was fairly chilly outside, and the bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was your typical continental style breakfast served in the basement breakfast room, with croissants, pain au chocolat, mini baguettes/batons of bread and some mini brioche type buns that were very nice. There was cornflakes or musli if you wanted cereal, and ham, salami, butter, emmental and cream cheese too. All very tasty! Oh, and tea, coffee and orange juice to drink. All in all the only thing that could have improved our stay at the Grand Hotel Francais was if it had been nearer to the city centre, but then it would presumably have been twice the price! PS, other reivews have mentioned Les Galopins restaurant nearby which we managed to get to on a Thursday evening. Have to agree with other reviews and say it was definitely worth going. The food was very good, reasonably priced, and its clientele seems to be more authentic Parisiens than tourists, meaning you get the proper Paris experience!", "Date": "March 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midlands", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel in a Great City\u201d", "Author": "BJC84", "ReviewID": "UR25795285", "Content": "We chose this hotel for a number of reasons, it was highly rated (around 50) out of all the hotels listed on trip advisor (around 2000), reports from independent web sites and the cost when compared to others around the same rating and were not disappointed. It is located very close to the Rue de Boulets metro station but is also only a 10-15 minute walk to the Nation metro station which is an intersection for a number of metro lines. It is outside the normal tourist area and as such the language could be a barrier, we are basic French speakers and got by. The service we received was really good and the manager (apologies never asked your name), arriving around 10:30 we checked straight in as our room was ready. We had asked for a room with a view and was not disappointed, on the first floor overlooking the main road. On checking in were given a tourist map (really helpful), local restaurant recommendations, and some champagne (not sure if this is the norm but the visit was for our 25th Wedding Anniversary) and finally some helpful phrases in French (we also got these most days). The room was not large (we paid for a superior room) but had everything we needed for our 5 day stay. It has been redecorated recently in a modern style with the bathroom also having a hydro jet shower. A negative here is that the TV did not have BBC (you're not there to watch TV but its nice to keep in touch and its listed on the web site) and no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. The hotel is still going through an upgrade but disruption is kept to a minimum. Breakfast is the usual continental style, with a good choice including tea and coffee. In our opinion more than adequate as you can have as much or little as you like. The breakfast room is in the basement, with tables set for 4. We always managed to get a seat, though we did see times when people had to wait though not for long (a couple of minutes). They also have daily newspapers for the guest's to take or return to the paper rack, English paper is the \"The Guardian\". A lot of people have commented on the noise. In our opinion noise was no more or less than in others we have stayed in, you could hear people from time to time but not what they were saying. All the staff were really helpful and ready to answer any question's you have. On the whole a great hotel which we definitely recommend, and are intending to go back and will stay here. The restaurants we tried locally were Chez Prosper (around a 15-20 min walk), this was for lunch on the day we arrived. This is were we found out about the language barrier, we were told we had to sit outside as I did not have a tie on (Talking to the hotel receptionist it seems this is not the case). On the food side my wife had a mixed fish salad which was excellent, I had a steak and did not enjoy it at all. We also went to Les Galopins (around 5-10 min walk), a traditional French bistro type restaurant with a great atmosphere. Le Ceffalu (around 5-10 min walk) is an Italian restaurant, they don't do pizza but do carbonara which is not on the menu. Both of the last 2 we recommend you book to ensure you get a table and they know you have come from the hotel, a number of people were turned away who turned up on spec. One of the things we liked at all these restaurants is that the locals use them and on a regular basis by the way they are greeted. There are lots of other cafe's, tabac's and fast food type restaurants locally, around the nation circle there are also local take away's (not international chain's). Travelling around the City was really easy and we bought a 5 day (1-6 zone pass) for around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac49 (about \u00c2\u00a345 at today's exchange rate), may seem expensive but we used this all week including getting from and too the airport. Finally a great find of a friendly hotel which is well located for getting around easily, with local amenities so you get the true French experience.

The room at the hotel was recently refurbished and although small it was of a really high quality and in perfect condition with a LCD TV on the wall. Most importantly the hotel and the room and bathroom were spotless, I have never been to a hotel that was so clean and tidy which was great. No problems with noise really, it is no different than any other hotel that I have been to before really, the road noise from outside was no different than you would expect from a city, in fact the road was mostly very quiet - which was a pleasant surprise being in such a large city. The staff were all very friendly and happy to talk to us in English as our French was rather limited. We had a complimentary bottle of wine when we had to wait a few moments for our room to be cleaned when we arrived back on the second day. Again when we left we were allowed to leave our bags in the luggage store so we could check out and come back later in the day to pick our bags before going to the airport. The breakfast was great in the basement below, you could have as much as you needed to eat and help you self, again everything was fresh and the very clean. All in all, a First Class Hotel that I would recommend to all and it will help make your stay in Paris a really enjoyable one.

The Grand Hotel is small, but perfectly formed. It is in a prime location, being within 2 - 5 minutes walk of two metro stops; it is perfectly placed to see all of the sights, but is afforded the added bonus of being a little out of the centre so that food prices are a little cheaper. Upon arriving we were greeted by the friendly manager who explained what was what, and also gave us a map of Paris and also one that they had prepared of the local restaurants. The room was superb: modern and clean. We were lucky enough to be on the fifth floor and have a balcony facing the street. However, not having this, I believe, wouldn't have detracted from the experience. The rooms have toilet and ensuite facilities, and also a flat screen TV. The shower was almost worth the price alone! There is a lift that could fit upto four average sized people in it. The breakfast room is in the basement, and is large enough to accomodate the gradual trickle of guests through from 8.30 - 10.30. It is 10 Euros each and features cereal, croissants etc. Theoretically, you could keep on going up and helping yourself. The bed linen and towels were changed daily, and all of the staff were polite, friendly and helpful. Paris itself was a joy to visit. It was our first time visiting; we stayed for four nights, and already want to go back. Like any big city it is busy and bustling, but, to be honest, I found that all, or most, of the Parisians I encountered to be charming and polite - willing to speak English when our French failed us! The Metro system is fabulous and so easy to use. On local restarants, I recommend 'Chez Prosper' (it will be on the map the hotel staff give you); it is lively and bustling and is VERY popular with the local Parisians. There seems to be no formal booking system, but people seemed to turn up and 'queue', waiting for up to half an hour for a table. We went a little earlier our second time (7.30- 8pm), and managed to get a table without waiting. The food is divine! Order the steak: it's huge.

After reading tripadvisor reviews we decided to book the hotel as we had got a good deal. We could not complain at all about anything in our room (61) everything was perfect from the decor to the air conditioning. The space available in the room was fantastic and the shower room, especially the shower with jets that was fantastic. We had 2 small balconies whcih the doors opened and as we were on the top floor we left them open. On holiday it is always a thought sometimes to come back to your hotel but not here we felt very relaxed in the room and enjoyed coming home to sleep. The service provided in the hotel was brilliant, the cleaners were very thorough in the rooms and the reception staff were brilliant - especially the young girl who gave us so much info regarding places to go and how to use the metro. We didnt have breakfast in the hotel but there are so many patisseries near by we just bought from them. We also ate in a recommended restaurant, Les Galopins, it was a fantastic meal, we thoroughly enjoyed it and wasn't too expensive. The metro service is easy once you get used to it and 2 stations were nearby rue de boulets (line 9 - took us to eiffel tower) and nation which has a lot of lines going through and also RER A which takes u to Disney (35mins). We mostly walked to the attractions as the weather was good, the walks are very enjoyable. One thing the hotel didn't have was tea and coffee facilities so we brought our own kettle as we like a cup of tea (Milk is available at near supermarket). We took a Taxi to the airport the day we left because we had an early flight cost approx 45 euros - make sure you are waitin for the taxi and not the other way round (On arriving at the airport we took the RER B to gare du nord then line 5 to oberkampf and then 9 to Rue de boulets).

As there are SO MANY hotels in Paris I made sure to do my research on Tripadvisor and was encouraged by the many great reviews on here. We were certainly not disappointed with our stay. We stayed in room 51, which was a superior shower room. The room was newly renovated (as is the whole of the hotel now, I think) with full air conditioning, a fridge, safe, flat screen TV and lovely balcony. It was well worth paying the few Euros extra for the superior room, as the large walk-in shower was great. Yes, the rooms are fairly small but they're perfectly adequate and don't feel cramped. We didn't have any problems with noise from the metro or street (as we were on the 5th floor and were able to keep the balcony doors shut) although there was a small amount of noise between rooms, but not too much. The staff were very friendly and helpful but not prying, which was perfect for us. The hotel's location is great for accessing all the Parisian sights via the brilliant metro service. When travelling from CDG airport, take the RER to Gare Du Nord, then get the metro no. 4 line to Strasbourg St Denis, and then change onto the no. 9 line to Rue De Boulets. We found this to be the easiest way to get to and from the airport and it only cost us about 8 Euros each. The hotel is right next to the Rue De Boulets station. I think it's just a short walk to the right. It is also close to many handy shops such as supermarkets and boulangeries.During our stay, we ate at the nearby Les Galopins restaurant and found it to be as great as previous reviews have claimed. The staff were extremely friendly and generous (even giving us free drinks as a welcome, as well as an English menu, which was very helpful!) and the food was great, traditional French cuisine.

However if you go into the little cafe bars in the metro station, you can get a beer much cheaper. Also one of the turn offs at the nation roundabout has a cinema, next door to the cinema on the right is a small bar that had a happy hour between 6-8. The price of a nice pint was 2 euros!! Not sure if that was only on saturdays though because it wasn't open on sunday.", "Date": "January 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mesa, AZ", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel in Paris with Superb Service & Great Location\u201d", "Author": "naneki06", "ReviewID": "UR6183192", "Content": "It is centrally located between 2 metro stations.

Unlike some of the other reviews i read about the Grand Hotel Francais I already knew about the Metro and how every city in the world should have one, it is about a 2 minute walk from the Rue de Boulets and about 5 mins from Nation, were you can get the RER to Disneyland. The hotel is a good distance from the centre of paris and most of the top sites but with the metro you are only about 20mins from most places. We walked to Pere La Chaise in about 10 mins.

We checked in late and were put in a room on the first floor. It was very small (as many European rooms are) but clean. The issue was the noise from the metro. We were constantly woken up every time the metro went past the hotel. In the morning, we spoke to the manager and he said he would find us a new room and we could get the keys when we returned from sightseeing for the day. We had already unpacked in the room and assumed we would just move all of our things when we returned. We got back in the late afternoon to find out that they had actually moved all of our items during the day while we were out. Each item was in the EXACT place where it had been in our previous room - from a card on the bedstand, to a sweater folded over the armoire door, etc. Needless to say, we were amazed and grateful! The new room was on the top floor and was very large with two big windows that faced the street. It was still a \"no frills\" type room with a small amount of noise from the metro and small bathroom & shower, but all in all, it was a good room. I wouldn't call it great, mainly because I typically stay in 4 and 5 star hotels and resorts, and of course it wasn't what I was used to. Though, I expected that knowing that the hotel was a 3 star. Plus, we got a great rate through priceline. The location was pretty good - near the metro - but it is a little farther from some of the typical tourist sites. While I thought this hotel was good with great service, I would probably stay in a 4 or 5 star hotel in the Latin Quarter or St. Germain next time - even if the cost is quite a bit more. But if you are on a budget, it is definitely a good find.", "Date": "June 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "winchester", "Title": "\u201cA Pleasant Hotel\u201d", "Author": "t50", "ReviewID": "UR3535509", "Content": "This is a very respectable, well run and pleasant hotel.

After seeing so many positive reviews here, we were skeptical that they may have been fakes posted by staff, but once we checked in, we were quickly relieved that this was a lovely hotel. The desk managers spoke English well and helped us get around and choose a great local restaurant, that was off the beaten path. The hotel is located very close (1 minute walk) to the train. Bd Voltaire is a main street with lots of cafes, restaurants, and local shops, which gear more toward the locals, as this isn't a major tourist area. We had a nice lunch for Eur 4.00 just down the street, for example. The downside to it being light on tourists is that when we arrived on Sunday, most restaurants/storefronts in the immediate area were closed. Still, the Bastille is only 10-15 minutes on foot, or 3 on the metro, with the opera and everything else. You will need to add time (15-30 minutes) to get to the key tourist destinations by metro. Our room was above the street, overlooking the corner. We could lean out the huge windows. The room was cozy but big enough for us. Our bathroom was clean and new.

Firstly one of the nicest parts of our stay was the friendliness of the staff. The chap on reception (who I believe is Wally the owner) is a great chap. His English is excellent and he's one of the friendlest people that I have ever found in a hotel. He would always make an effort to say hello and goodbye each time you passed through reception. He seemed to appreciate the effort I made in trying to speak French but thankfully his english was much better than my french! The rooms are smaller than I would have hoped but I believe that this is pretty much the norm for Paris. Having said this however they are extremely clean and do have all the features that you'd need - desk, phone, TV, hairdryer (that actually does dry your hair unlike hairdryers in some hotels). The bathroom is small but has great water pressure - the shower is very powerful but the thing that lets it down is that it's a hand held shower - all it would need would be a wall bracket and a shower curtain and it would be perfect! We found the location to be pleasing. Okay so it is a bit out of the centre, however it is between two metro stations. We arrived in to CDG Airport and caught the RER B to Chatalet Les Halles, change to the RER A to Nation. Upon arrival at Nation station, you leave the station, cross the road to Boulevard Voltaire and the Grand Hotel Francais is around a five minute walk on the right hand side. Nation is one of the central stations that has 4 or 5 lines running through it so the hotel is perfectly suited to get to any of the main attractions via the metro. There is another metro station - Rue des Boulets which is closer to the hotel (literally 1 mins walk away), however only the no. 9 line runs to this one. With the hotel being away from the centre it is certainly cheaper with regards to food and drink than residing right in the heart of Paris and is only 20 mins or so away from the attractions via the metro (single metro ticket only \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.40).

Overview: This hotel is clean, friendly and in a good neighborhood, and the photo's on thier web site are accurate. It is a short walk to the Metro lines 1-2-6-& 9 & RER. Guests of the hotel were from the USA, Britan, Germany. Ranged from ages of mid 20's to late 60's and all couples or families. No loud drunks, or uncomfortable situations permitted in this hotel. So if your planning on a \"girls gone wild\" spring break, I would tell you to look for a hotel in the Latin Quarter. The hotel staff: Incredibly helpful and every desk clerk spoke english, which is more than I can say regarding ability to speak French. Checking in and out was smooth with no surprises. Rooms: Small if you have never traveled to Europe, but larger than what I have stayed in in Rome or London. Quite with the windows closed, but I imagine that in the summer or warmer weather street noise may bother some people. There is no AC yet, but plans to have it installed are in the works for 2005. Rooms are cleaned each day, and we had no need to \"hide\" valuables. If you pack like your staying away for a month for a weeks vacation you will have little options as to where to place your belongings. There is TV, but if your concerned about TV I question your motive for travel to Paris. Beds were comfortable. Ask for a room that would be considered front corner, faces street. You will have 3 windows vs. 1 or 2. Safety: We walked, jogged and rode the metro at all hours. We never had a problem. The hotel is locked down every night and nobody gets in that does not belong. As in any big city the area has a few panhandlers. I found \"street people\" to be non-aggressive and I can count on one hand how many times I was approached in the Nation area. I had far more encounters with panhandlers and con-artists in central Paris, mostly in the tourist areas. Resturnats: Plenty of local neigborhood cafe's, restruants, sandwich shops, bakery's, and shopping at reasonable prices. In fact, we did much of our gift shopping in Nation and saved money vs. shopping in central Paris or tourist areas. We did not have a bad meal. There are several in the neighborhood we did not get to. But you can eat some great French food and not pay central Paris prices. Bars and Partying: If you want this activity, walk or metro a short distance to Place de Bastile. Note: Learn some French before you go. Many people are helpful, but since this is not a tourist area and many of the people speak French and very little English. But you are in France. We shopped and ate often in the neighborhood and always had a plesant time.
