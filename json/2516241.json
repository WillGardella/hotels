First was Noth block, ambassador room - nice room and comfortable bed. Has a small kitchen area with fridge, sink etc but no cutlery, plates etc. ! Not a problemfor me as I have no intention cooking on holiday but might be a problem for others. The biggest problem this hotel had was parking. It was a busy time for the hotel and we arrived quite late from Las Vegas. When we drove around to park near North block, most visitors had arrived and there was no spaces near the entrance. Then noticed that staff had parked all their club cars / golf buggies in the main car park and gone home for the night....there were at least 8 of them taking up spaces. We had to park in a service area around the side of the block, near a garage and drag our luggage around. Shame on the staff! The pool / water park was really good and our son loved it but it was extremely busy with chairs all gone early. They had a booking for a party on day and took a load of recliners for the guests but in the six hours I was in the park, no-one sat on the chairs while other guests sat on the floor ! Lazy river was shut half a day due to lack of staff. I did see peope pull up in cars, use the water park facilities and then leave at the end of the day, so if it is open to the public, no wonder it is busy with no recliners. They did provide ice cold water coolers and cups around the pools which was lovely. Also stayed in a Casitas which was better as it had it's own parking and was really close to the water park...shame it smelt stale on arrival and we had to phone houseeeping to get the microwave cleaned of old food! Would still stay again and recommend the Casitas ! Staff were friendly and accomodation was good to great ( once aired and cleaned), water park excellent for kids with lazy river, slide and toddler pool. Our full American breakfast was included with great omlettes / fried eggs made fresh by a lovely lady.", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mechanicsville, VA", "Title": "\u201cRooms could use updating\u201d", "Author": "JJVA_12", "ReviewID": "UR129053315", "Content": "Was here in Jan of 2012 and just wish the rooms would be updated.

Our little boy slept comfortably on the pull-out couch in the living room. The only thing I didn't care for too much was how crowded the pools and water park were. There were no available lounge chairs at any pool, and what's worse, people weren't even sitting in them! They simply put their towel on the chairs and then left, perhaps to go down the lazy river or the slides. My 5 year-old enjoyed himself nonetheless, and that's what's important.

I can't really complain about the optional $2.25 resort fee after pricing out a cross town rival's $40 per day mandatory fee on top of higher base prices.

I will start out by saying my arrival into Phoenix was rocky with my 2 day old iphone being stolen...but i put all feelings aside and enjoyed my phone free vacation! Checking in was a breeze, no lines, great service, we received complimentary bottled water as well as our room preferences. The resort is laid out in several buildings that are disconnected and have seperate parking lots but you can definetly walk from one end to another in 5 minutes! We drove around to find our building which has its own grand lobby and beautiful patio and pool area with swim up bar and waiter service. I was in the north pointe building in a 3rd floor room facing the pool, yes it is loud in the evenings when people are at the pool but with the TV on i could not hear a thing! and my balcony faced a quiet courtyard area with the sounds of a calming fountain! The king suite was very spacious with a large seperate living room with pull out couch and a seperate bathroom and sink area, large flat screen tvs with lots of channels, clean bathroom and floors. I inspected it vigorously as i have a crawling baby. The best part was the french doors that seperated all 3 spaces from each other so you could be in the living room without disturbing anyone in bathroom or bedroom. The fridge wasnt cooling properly and my precious milk spoiled, i called up to the lobby at almost 11pm and they sent someone with a new fridge in less than 5 minutes! Same with towels, i requested 6 extra towels and i received it right away! The food at the north pointe pool was much much better than the waterpark, we ordered almost every item off both menus so this is an accurate representation. We ate at Rico's at the breakfast buffett most mornings, no lines, great service, delicious food, the croissants were to die for! One morning i had a spa appointment and grabbed food to go at the \"starbucks\" cafe and although my muffins were delicious it was ridiculously expensive $30 for 2 muffins, 2 breakfast sandwiches and 2 bottles of juice! You are better off spending $32 for 2 adults to eat in the buffett! By the way kids 3 and under eat free! The waterpark food i hated but they made the mixed drinks very strong and good! We walked to Aunt Chiladas and had great service...i wont comment on the food cause i am from texas and anything besides tex-mex just doesnt taste good to me...i shoulda known better. Waterpark was amazing...its not a waterpark per say just a collection of a large pool with waterfall area, baby pool, large slide pool, medium sized pool with basketball and volleyball and lazy river. There was also mini golf to the side, you pay one time $5 to play or a $2 per day resort fee for unlimited play. All the pools have towels! There is also a playground and if they are not in session they will allow you to bring your kids inside camp coyote and play in a room full of toys, disney movies playing on the large screen, a puppet theater...perfect for the under 4 yr old kids who could not otherwise attend camp and wake up early and get hot in the playground. There is also a public park by Aunt Chiladas you can walk to and play at. The spa was amazing, i had the best massage and wonderful service there as well! The concierge was very helpful in booking spa appointments, tours to sedona and grand canyon, discounts at rawhide for the kids. Location was great, chinese restaurant that delivers quickly across the street as well as a sports bar type restaurant, there is also a bank of america bank and atm across from the lobby down the street minute drive there is a walgreens and fast food restaurants the airport was 9.2 miles away, 15 minute drive Scottsdale was 12 miles away Rawhide was 25 minute drive One day was rainy and cold so we drove about 8 minutes out to Jamba playland an indoor carnival for kids which was also amazing and so fun for them with cheap carnival food for us to keep our mouths busy with. If you force me to have one complaint, it would be...the wifi is terrible...dont bother paying for it cause it did not work...go down to the lobby and wifi is free there or you can use the business center computers. I asked for a refund of my wifi charge and it was given to me no questions asked. I was there for 4 days and i would have stayed for 2 more if the airlines didnt have change fees, it was so much fun, perfect for me and my family, perfect location", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City, Utah", "Title": "\u201cGood for the Kids\u201d", "Author": "Pixtonian", "ReviewID": "UR128190702", "Content": "I was in Arizona for school but my family and kids came down and went to the resort.

From start to finish our stay was just perfect. The staff at this resort could not have been more accomodating or professional. We stayed in a 1 bedroom/Queen bed suite which fit our family of 5 comfortably. The layout of the rooms allowed enough space for all of us to move around, while still allowing everyone their \"personal space.\" The resort pools were clean and inviting and were open late every evening, which is a nice change from other hotels that I have stayed at. The waterpark was small, but had enough pools/slides to entertain my children (ages 2, 10 and 12) for all the 6 days that we were there. The only problem I found was that there were not enough chairs in the River Ranch to accomodate all of the guests. If you did not wait in line at 8am to save your chairs, then you pretty much were out of luck finding one. One day I decided to go the the park at 8:45am to find some chairs. I found 1 chair at this time with no towels or belongings on it. I asked EVERYONE in the surrounding area if that 1 chair was available. A nice gentleman and his wife said \"No ....Nobody has that chair. It is free for you to take.\" Well, I decided to go back to the room and get my 3 children to come back to the waterpark with me so that we could all share that ONE chair. When we arrived...2 year old in tow....A nasty woman popped up out of her chair and yelled that we \"Took her chair.\" When I tried explaining that nothing was on the chair, she proceeded to tell me that she came at 8am to reserve 5 chairs and that that chair was HERS! I am just grateful to the kind woman from afar who saw what was happening and intervened. This woman tried to comfort me and did state \"I know how ugly it can get out here.\" I did not want my anger to get the best of me, so I decided to be the better person and walk away from the situation. It may have ruined a few hours of my day, but I wasn't going to let it ruin my stay. I called management about it, and they were extremely understanding and supportive. As far as the restaurants available, I felt that there were a variety of choices at the resort. We ate at the cabana and the Hole in the Wall restaurant most days, and were very satisfied with the selection and quality of the food. They also have room service available, and if you wanted a quick breakfast/coffee in the morning there is a Starbucks located in the gift shop. This area opens up at 6am. One morning my 2 year old was crying that he wanted \"milk\". At 5 am I walked out to the lobby to see if the gift shop was open. It was closed, but a nice gentleman (?maintanance worker) went out of his way to find me a cup of milk. Again, the staff could not have been nicer. On Easter morning, we had a local florist make Easter baskets for our children and the hotel had the Easter bunny come to our door to pass them out to my children. What a great touch! I thank the concierge for the recommendation of the florist and Easter basket idea. Even as we were leaving and several items could not be packed into our luggage, the concierge sent someone from shipping (Brad) to take care of the items and ship them to our home within minutes of our departure.

I find it ironic that a GM does not work on weekends not to mention during spring break - how convenient. Overall the service was lacking at the resort and there was little effort made to make you feel special. Furthermore, it would have to warn that the water park is nothing close to what I would consider being a water park. It had one 'slow' slide and a lazy river, it was dirty and there was very poor service in the eating area (we had to wait forever to get a couple of drinks). Nonetheless we never went back and stuck to the resort pools which were nice. The rooms were great for families giving you space but the location of the resort was less than desirable.

We arrived around 3:30 and check-in was quick. They give you your room information and then you have to see the someone else to provide directions to your room, which is strange. Our room was in the main building on the second floor. The room was a 1 bed room suite and was an ok size. There was a sofa bed, coffee table, chair, tv stand, desk and little counter area in the living room. There was a mini refrigerator and there was a safe in the cabinet under the television. The living room was a little cramped when you had the sofa bed out. The bathroom was split between a room with the sink and another small room with the toilet and tub. These rooms were on either side of the entry to the bedroom. There were 2 sets of doors so you could close the doors between the bedroom and the bathroom or the living room and the bathroom or both. There was a small balcony with 2 small chairs and a little table. We only used this area to spray on sunscreen. The air conditioner was always running but the room never got really cool, and the air never shut off. There are pools at each building area, but also the River Ranch area where they have the larger pools, lazy river, slide, grille etc. This area was nice, but definitely did not have enough chairs or space for the people at the hotel. If you went down after 9:30 in the morning, you couldn't find a chair to sit on. The lazy river is large for a hotel pool, but was too lazy. It didn't seem to move at all. My son did like the pool and slide. One good feature of the hotel was the Coyote Camp, where you could have your kids go for half day or full day camp. There is an extra charge, but my son enjoyed it. They made crafts, went swimming and learned about the desert and the area. All of the staff there were extremely friendly and helpful. One disappointment was the \"nature walk\" which actually took place in the parking lot. Areas of the hotel are spread out over the property, which is ok except they do not have the property designed well for walking amongst the areas.

We are Hilton Honors members and always stay at their resorts...this one left us disappointed. The hotel sits across from a large, empty lot, which does not make a great first impression. The room is laid out nice, but a typlical room. The shower curtain was way too long for the shower & the rod was half broken. The fan cover fell off and while they came and fixed it, left all of the old parts on the back of the toilet. The tub was scratched up and looked dirty, but was actually just stained. There is only one sink & the firdge either froze our food or was luke warm. We ended up throwing out a bunch of our food. The grounds were always unkept. Trash cans overflowing, towels all over pool area, food/trash left out around pool area. While at the private pool area, twice I had to go tell the staff (of which there were very few around)that the birds were all over the food and pestering the guests. Never did anyone come by and ask us if we wanted a drink or some food. There weren't enough pool chairs and people would leave towels over chairs all morning while they were at the water park...with the idea of coming back to the private pools after they were done at the park. We were at the north pool and it was very difficult to find a chair that had sun for most of the day. By 1 or 2pm, you were in the shade and all of the sun chairs were taken. Lots of people put towels on ground or sat on ground against the fence to stay in the sun. The water park was fun for kids but a parents nightmare! You could never find a chair (again people reserved a ton of chairs so they could come and go). The staff was so thin it was impossible to get service. It took forever to get lunch and then it was wayyyy over priced. They even charge you a \"service fee\" for eating in the water park area. We had to pay $16 service charge, tax and an 18% gratuity was automatically included (which didn't incentify anyone to hustle!)...so we were $45 in the hole and hadn't eaten anything yet. For a family of 5 to have chicken wraps, club sandwich & cheese pizza it was $118 for lunch. We quickly figured out that the food we had to get to a grocery store before we went broke on food & drinks (of which most drinks were $10-$12 for liquor and $6 beer). The water park area also had loud music playing and at one time had a live band...crazy loud & way over crowded! Some of the positives - the bell boys were awesome. They gave us a ride to & from grocery store free. Bartender at the cantina (Chad) was great at suggesting restaurants and places to take kids. Beautiful scenery. Great workout center. We met a ton of great families and got to know the kids. We would not visit this property again. We felt like they gave us a decent price on the room for the week, knowing that they would get us on food/drinks/tips. We went up to thier other property (Tilipia?) for dinner and met several people who had found Squaw the same and never went back or checked out and moved to Tilipia. I agree with the other comments that were left also...it's just an okay property ` but could be great with the right management and changes made. One last thing...Rico's is an onsite restaurant that is great. The food is good and the service was good. The only problem is that it's the only place around to get breakfast and it's $17 for adults (anyone over 10yrs old) and $10 for kids. Very, very pricey and it is just a simple buffet.

After all the glowing reviews here, I probably had unrealistic expectations about this resort, but came away fairly disappointed, and can't really see coming back. The property is pretty and fairly well maintained, although clearly some of the buildings are older. The rooms were reasonably well updated, and the high-end toiletries were a nice touch. The fitness center was excellent - I am usually disappointed with resort fitness centers and this one is one of the best I have seen. There is some confusing information about whether they charge for it or not - they told us we had free access as Hilton Honors members, but they didn't seem to be charging anyone. The first source of disappointment was the waterpark - the main pool is much smaller than it appears in the photos on the website, and even with the other smaller pools, the pool areas are simply not big enough to accomodate the number of guests during peak periods - and forget about trying to get a chair if you are not waiting at the gates when the waterpark opens. That being said, the kids still enjoyed the pools. A second pool-related issue is that the waterpark closes at 8 PM, but the smaller courtyard pool is open until 11 PM. If you get a room overlooking this pool and do not want to hear people shrieking in the pool until 11 PM, I recommend asking for a different room. I wish we had. The food situation is what put us over the edge of not wanting to return. A resort this size should have more restaurant options with a greater variety of choices than is available. The poolside options are fine - burgers, etc. The service poolside ranged from extremely helpful and attentive to barely acknowledging our presence when we went to the bar for drinks. Sit down restuarants were terrible. Hole in The Wall, which they described as their signature restaurant offered more burgers and such, plus chili and barbeque options, which may have been reasonably tasty if they had been served hot. There is another sit down restaurant on the property which sounded like it might have more high end / healthy options. After wandering around for 20 minutes trying to find it with the confusing signs, we discovered that it was closed on Sunday, leaving the only dinner options on property more burgers and barbeque, which we found unacceptable. Fortunately, the concierge steered us to the nearby Sierra Bonita restaurant, which was excellent.

I am also brand loyal to Hilton/Hyatt/Marriott ....so a combination of factors led us here. The positives: suites with extra room for kids including a comfy pull out sofa, a safe, and a mini fridge. Very clean. The Ranch where the main pool and slide and lazy river are: excellent with kids if you can find chairs. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful all around. There is a small coffee and baked goods store inside the lobby which is handy (see below). Parking is free but can be hard to find a spot at night. The negatives: Its location is not ideal i.e. nothing around it. The layout is sprawling with two larger buildings and a bunch of villas/townhouses. To get to the Ranch you have to trek across a parking. So depending on which building you are in, that could be an issue especially with small kids in tow. The appearance of the buildings, from the old depressing yellow color to the exterior corridors: does not feel like a true resort. Maybe a personal preference, but it just did not look like what I would expect from a Hilton resort. The lobby was very plain vanilla and not very inviting. Overall, the place looked like a very upscale Holiday Inn but not a Hilton.. The first night, we asked for extra bath towels which after 90 minutes and three phone calls, we never got and gave up. They charge for internet per device. Not an issue if you have a 3G type phone.. But charge for internet per device?? Really cheap... Morning wake up was with unavoidable noise of other kids running around in the outside halls; gardeners' leaf blower machines; and large trucks (garbage? deliver?) The main restaurant is in a detached building and about 100 yards from the main lobby, requiring walking thru a parking lot again. Not a big deal for us but would have been if the kids were smaller and it was hot or raining outside. Not a proper setup at all. As mentioned, there is nothing around the hotel so you have to either eat there or drive somewhere..

Fortunately Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak fit the bill perfectly. First, the location. You are 20 mins from the airport (take the 24th street exit instead of the 44th street exit when you leave), you are tucked back against the beautiful Squaw Peak which provides some awesome views and hiking for any visitors wanting to experience Arizona. You are also in a nice part of town; along the bottom side of Squaw Peak and right side is Paradise Valley and you are only 20-25 mins from Scottsdale / Old-Scottsdale if you want to do a day of window shopping and eating at great places (or head to Fashion Square mall). I can't express the convenience of this location enough; you will need a car, but you have access to everything you came to see (Have kids? Want to go to the Zoo? 20 mins!) within 20-30mins away. Ok, now about the property... The Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak has been at that location for a *long* time, 20+ years. It was built as an oasis into the side of the mountain with a big sprawling property, a giant meandering pool. A lazy river. A mini golf course. Tennis courts. Basketball. A small mock \"Old West\" town for kids to play in... it is just a huge/fun property that sprawls out in every direction. You have rooms in the main lobby then you have Casitas and larger living arrangements on the outskirts of the property. Everything is easily walkable. While some aspects of the hotel rooms have been upgraded (like the bathrooms and bedding) other aspects of the rooms definitely still feel the same as they were in the 80s. We had a really nice big suite with a huge living/sitting/social area and the table was straight out of an 80s movie with all the wear and tear you would expect for 20 years of sitting in a hotel room. I think Hilton made the decision to incrementally upgrade the property by redoing all the bathrooms (the most important) then the bedding areas and then slowly doing touch-ups on the lesser details in the rooms like the older couches or tables. Honestly though, everything was clean and comfortable so it didn't bother any of us (and I tend to like nicer things). A few of the families got one of the big 2-story casitas on the property so we got to spend time inside those as well; they were comfortable and clean (Again the bathrooms and bedrooms were new; flat screen TVs, new beds, new counters, etc.) and the living room felt a *hair* older but again, not a big deal at all. Everything was clean, there were no issues with feeling the couches were \"Gross\" or anything like that. The kitchenette was a small/typical kitchenette which worked perfectly for those families; full fridge was a boon for left-overs and microwave was great for the kids for late night popcorn parties. The weather in December (if you haven't been in AZ before) is a gift from the heavens and is why people winter here; warm sun on your face with a nice dry 60-70 degree breeze is heaven; we ate outdoors at the restaurant on the property and were very happy with our food and the ambiance out on the patio was beautiful. TIP: Visiting this property in the off season (December) is awesome. It is like having a small-town theme park to yourself. The help told us that in the summer (the on-season) it gets SO PACKED that you are shoulder-to-shoulder outside at the pool/mini-golf/lazy-river area which honestly sounded so horrible to me I would have checked out and left had we been there in the summer. Keep that in mind; one of the reasons we all had such an awesome time is because we went in the dead of December (2nd week of Dec) and had most of the place to ourselves and our huge family.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lima, Per\u00fa", "Title": "\u201cNice water park\u201d", "Author": "CarlaRJ", "ReviewID": "UR126833056", "Content": "Is a big and nice hotel with beauty desert and mountain landscape.

The room layout was nice. Living area with pullout sofa. Bathroom itself was small but the sink area was separate so that opened things up a bit. There is a door between the bathroom area and the living room area as well as a door between the bedroom and the bathroom area which is nice for privacy and noise reduction. There is a main pool area and then pools by the buildings.The \"small\" pool in our area was a nice size with jacuzzi. We didn't have time to use the pool but lots of guests did. The pools are all heated. The main pool is amazing and very family friendly. They have \"Dive-In\" movies by the pool for kids and families on Friday evenings. Nice touch for the kids. There is a wonderful fire pit in the pool area. However it gets very crowded so getting a seat is tough at times. The Hole in the Wall Restaurant is in the pool area. Good, friendly service but food left quite a bit to be desired. Rico's American Grille is open for breakfast. Breakfast buffet was average..service a bit slow. There is also a gift store with a starbucks inside which served breakfast to go. It was always extremely crowded but offered quite a bit of variety if you didn't mind the wait. All that being said, this is a nice resort but there were a few things that were a bit annoying. Wifi...as Hilton Honors Diamond members we receive free Wifi. The Wifi signal was HORRIBLE. Again this was a large property and I'm guessing the demand for wifi was very high. There were times that we couldn't even log onto the wifi or stay connected if we were able to get on. It was faster to just use the 3G on my phone to look things up if I needed internet. If you have to pay the fee for the Wifi there I would definitely think twice about it. It was annoying enough when it was free, I can't imagine how annoying it would be it I had to pay a charge for it per day! Phone service.....I have a Sprint phone. My husband has a Sprint personal phone and a Verizon business phone. Our Sprint phones had very little or no signal the entire time. When I was in the bedroom area...the phone was roaming. Moving to the front living area brought a bar of service. 3G was off and on....mostly off. My husband's Verizon phone had a good signal and he didn't have any issues with the 3G wireless card from Verizon that he has for his laptop. Just something to keep in mind if you have a Sprint phone! Noise level.....as with any hotel that offers suites, it draws families. Add the fact that this particular hotel has a wonderful pool area and it was spring break when we were there and it draws families and large groups. It was just my husband and I on this trip so for us it seemed really loud. The small pool was in the middle of the suites and was always busy. The main pool closes at 8:00 PM and people move to the small pools which are open till 11:00 PM. The sound really carries between the buildings. We were able to close the doors between the bathroom area and the living area and block most of it out but it was noticeable. When we arrived, they were having a birthday party just outside the lobby area and you couldn't even hear to check in. It was a weekend and the noise level went down once Sunday evening came so maybe it was just the weekend, spring break, lots of kids, all of the above that worked together to make it extremely loud.

If you can get past the dated exterior, it is a really is a wonderful place for a family holiday. The pool area is beautiful and scenic, and the property is immaculately clean and beautifully kept. Housekeeping and front desk staff were very helpful and polite. No problem with check in. Although the hotel was full as it was spring break, the place is big enough that the pool and common areas didn't seem overcrowded. We were at Atlantis in Bahamas last year, and I think Squaw Peak is more scenic, less crowded, have as much swimming pool variety for kids, and is less expensive. I have travelled extensively on business and believe my standards might be a big higher than the average, and I was very pleased with Squaw Peak, notwithstanding the dated exterior. Had a great time and would recommend it for a family holiday.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "Maur75", "ReviewID": "UR126074892", "Content": "I was expecting a really nice resort, but instead it was a middle-of-the-road hotel with a confusing layout.

The layout is so confusing that after they give you their room, they have an attendant whose job is to explain how to get to your room!! Initially, we got the \"studio suite\"... I was like.. is that a studio? or a suite? One room or two? Well.. it's one very small room with just enough room for the king-size bed and with flat-screen TV on the wall to the side (so you can't look at straight on if lying in bed). It was unacceptable for me and my wife so we got into a real suite in the main building. The front desk was nice and accommodating. In main building, the entrances were all open to the outside. Frankly, it felt like a motel! But inside, the room was actually good with separate living room and bedroom, and everything you'd expect in a Hilton. It was February and I was in Phoenix for a conference so I didn't get a chance to check out the pools, etc. Please note... my wife drove down the street to get something to eat, and had several homeless men approach her. And in evening, we were at another fast food place drive-thru, and we had homeless guy come to our car and scream at us for money while we were waiting to get our food! I got the sense that the area is not the safest.. or at least, there are ALOT of homeless around.

This is the first scathing review I have ever given. I hope I never have to give another. First I should say that I am a local and I have been to this resort several times. I even stayed there in a Casita on my wedding night a year ago and had a great time. The Casitas are dated but nice, the pool area and lazy river is great, and we had a great breakfast buffet in the morning. The resort itself is worth staying at. That being said, I went today with a few girlfriends for a spa day (we do this every few months) and had what was without a doubt the most miserable spa experience I have ever had. The spa itself is exceptionally small and there is nothing luxurious about it. I would consider myself somewhat of an expert regarding the local resort spas, and this one just lacked all the niceties of the others. The room where you wait for your service only has four small chairs for example, while every other spa I've ever been to had a large room with luxurious couches and pillows, etc. I wouldn't have bothered to complain about this in an online forum if it were not for the HORRIBLE massage I received. My massage therapist was really high energy; almost manic like, not calm and pleasant the way a massage therapist should be. I have expensive extensions in my hair and asked her not to massage my scalp. She laughed and told me she was going to touch my scalp anyway. I was totally dumbfounded and did not know how to respond. I spent the massage totally tense, especially when she was working my neck and shoulders in fear she was going to put her oily hands into my scalp and ruin my extensions. (She never did thank goodness, but she did have to ask me to relax my shoulders at one point because I was just so tense.) This woman had the worst \"touch\" I have ever experienced. She barely put her hands on me, very lightly caressing me but not massaging me at all. I considered asking her to go deeper (she never asked me how I liked the pressure) but she had what felt like warts on the inside of one of her palms that were scratching me as she touched me so I honestly couldn't stand the thought of her touching me any harder. The whole experience was so miserable. If felt awful, I was disgusted by whatever was on her hands and I almost asked her to stop twice because it was just so unpleasant. I managed to endure the whole thing only because of my fear of upsetting her. (I should mention that I did have a great facial a few hours later by a different lady who was awesome.) When I went to pay I was told there was a mandatory 18.00 tip per service. I had managed to not complain up to this point, but the fact that I had to suffer through the hour and pay for it at all was the most I could do, adding a totally undeserved \"mandatory\" tip was just more than I could manage. I shared my experience with the very young man at the desk who was totally ill-equipped to handle a customer service complaint. \"Well it wasn't supposed to be a deep tissue massage\" he said, not rudely, but just immaturely. I informed him that I have never had a deep tissue massage but have enjoyed dozens of Swedish type massages and I have never walked out significantly more tense and stressed than when I walked in. Clearly frazzled, he asked me if I would just please pay the required tip and he would have his manager call me. It was apparent that he was totally flustered and not trained to handle a complaint. I didn't want to give the kid a hard time so I just paid it and left. We shall see if I get a call from the spa manager but I don't know what they can do now to resolve the situation after they already charged me and required me to pay a large, very undeserved tip. Basically, this is an older but nice resort with some desirable attributes, but the spa is just absolutely horrible. Do not visit this spa for any reason. There are so many wonderful, pampering, luxurious spa resorts in the valley where you can get a fabulous massage AND fabulous service; there is just no reason to suffer at the Pointe Squaw Peak.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLovely Stay\u201d", "Author": "elledub", "ReviewID": "UR119278706", "Content": "I have to admit I was a bit nervous booking this hotel after reading some of the reviews.

One of my responsibilities is to organize events for 80-100 senior technology executives for one week of intensive meetings three times per year. My customers are frequent world travelers, and are quite discerning regarding the food and services they receive while traveling. My opinion and experience is that the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peaks is by far one of the best North American business meeting locations that we have used in the past 10 years. For worry-free meetings and events, I would not hesitate to again put my full faith in the service and quality of the Hilton North Point Squaw Peaks. Pros: *Excellent Sales Staff: My representative was the same person from start to finish- great continuity. *All-Pro Banquet staff: Some of the best in the business, the core Team has low turnover and superb attitudes and skills. *Superior food: The Pointe Hilton Chef and Staff provide food of the highest quality with \"Farm to Fork\" style whenever possible. Ingredients and selection are top-grade! *Complete refurbishment of the resort is nearly complete. The property upgrade was planned well as to be virtually transparent to the guests. *True HD television: so many hotels provide updated TV's while still feeding those sets with outdated (cheaper) analog signals. Pointe Hilton provides a wide variety of HD channel selections. *The in-house Audio/Visual team will help you pull off a successful meeting without a hitch! Any minor issues were taken care of with the highest priority. *Fast Internet: property has some great bandwidth to the door and they say they are adding even more capability! Cons: *Limited restaurant selections off-property within walking distance. Grocery stores and services are close by, however. (about 1/2 mile) *Slow elevators: luckily, it's only a three-story complex. *Tap water was \"murky\" smelling and tasting. This is mostly the fault of the local water utility, but I hope Squaw Peaks Hilton would address this issue. Be sure and drink bottled water, IMHO. *Confusing to navigate on-site. It's a large property, and the North building is identical to the South Building. Be sure and get a map! *Luggage carts are locked up, forcing you to call for a bell-captain. Sometimes I just want to do it myself! *Annoying voice mail SPAM advertising: We would arrive back to our sleeping rooms to see the message light lit, just to find out the message was an advertisement for the Spa services! we have never experienced this in any hotel anywhere in the world.

Upon checkout, the gentlemen removed a charge on my bill, a phone call which I did not make, and offered to give me a complimentary breakfast. If you have a problem, they will go to every effort to fix it. I have stayed at many Hilton hotels, and the staff is always great!!

We arrived early and our room was ready at noon. We were driven the short distance to our tower in a golf cart so we didn't have to carry our luggage after a long flight. I was impressed with our suite. There was a spacious living area, separated by double doors from the bathroom area that was also separated by pocket doors from the bedroom with a balcony that overlooked the water park and mountains. We had a mini-refrigerator that was available for our use, coffee and tea service and two flat screen televisions. Our rooms were super-clean upon arrival and were serviced each day by a cheerful staff. We ate at Rico's the first night. My food was good and service was quick. Hole in the Wall for breakfast was good. We ate there for lunch one day and the service was slow and their beer was hot. The State of Illnois Elks had a hospitality room in 1466-1467. This was outstanding! The rooms were connected by an airconditioned hallway to a tree-covered terrace patio overlooking the beautiful pool area and swim up bar. This was very conveniently located and allowed ample space for all of our members and guests. I had a manicure and a therapeutic massage at the Spa located on the grounds of the hotel. The manicure is still holding up over a week later after many hours in the pool and my massage by Mitchell was to die for! Almost makes me wish I lived closer so I could return regularly for another! I loved the fact that the hotel had pools separate from the water park. Since my children did not attend the convention with me, I was really not in the mood to be splished and splashed. There were several families that raved about the water park and enjoyed the time spent there. My only complaint, if I had to give one, would be that the Wi-Fi was not a free service.

As Hilton Honors Gold members we were upgraded to a Casita room and at first we were amazed at this room that was more like an apartment. Very quickly our amazement turned to disappointment. When we got to the room it was hot so we looked at the thermostat and saw it was actually on and was set to 72\u00b0. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and decided that they didn't turn it on early enough before we got there to cool off this huge room and turned down the thermostat a little more. I also noticed a slight cigarette smell when we walked in but nobody else in my group smelled it. I put it off as coming from the 3 extinguished cigarettes at our front door in the sand. Wasn't this supposed to be a non-smoking room? There was an upstairs bedroom but there was no place to put our huge suitcase. We ended up putting it on the landing at the top of the stairs on the luggage rack. There's a lot of drawers and cabinets to put your clothes in but I wasn't about to unpack our suitcase for a two night stay. No complaints about the upstairs bathroom which was huge, nor the kitchenette which included almost a full sized fridge and a sink. The dining and living areas were also huge, with plenty of room for us to spread out. Upstairs there was a balcony with an umbrella table and chairs and lounge chairs, must be nice when it's cooler but we weren't going to sit out there in 114\u00b0 temps. Coming in from the balcony I saw a cup by the door and found it was a cup full of smoked cigarettes in water, yuck. Again, wasn't this supposed to be a non-smoking room? Even the pool disappointed my children. They like to swim and frolic along in the lazy river but were told they HAD to be floating along in tubes, which got old for them very quickly. What is the reason for this rule? The lazy river at the Hilton near Disney World doesn't have that requirement, so I know it's not a safety issue. That scratched their fun. That evening, the room just didn't seem to get very cool. Even though we now had the thermostat set to 50\u00b0, it still felt like 90. It got a little cooler in the middle of the night while we were sleeping, so we just thought that if left on all day the next day, it would finally get comfortable. No. The next night it was even hotter! Even after a cool shower, nobody could fall asleep until about 3am, when it started cooling down. Even the high speed internet stopped working during peak hours. Is this room in the Twilight Zone? What a terrible stay.

The rooms face outside courtyard and/or pool areas, which can be a bit noisy at night, depending on which room you stay in. Didn't see much garbage within the hotel grounds itself.

Now, onto the Hole In The Wall River Ranch waterslide/lazy river/main pool...I was very disappointed with the lack of cleanliness with this pool area. You could see the dirty \"bath-tub ring\" on the waterslide, which grossed me out. Most of the chairs were dirty and the pool area itself, was dirty. Our family had fun at the pools, no doubt, but, you just have to look past the filth. We just ran straight to shower after our time with pool area. Have to say, the Lazy River was relaxing and appeared a bit more clean. Next time we stay, I'd really like to check out a casita, which might make the stay a bit more comfortable with less noise.

Choose this resort for the Hole in the Wall River Ranch area that is included with your stay. Found this resort while searching for someplace close to home for a quick getaway with the grandkids who love the water. This time of year with the temps near 110+ this was a good choice. I booked a two night stay by phone, in a standard king one bedroom, and took advantage of the dining deal offered. For an aditional $25 a night, I got $50 a night in dining certificates. Our check in was painless, just a few minutes and we were off to our room. Parking was close to room and free. On first glance, the room felt very small, and even a bit dated, but as I looked closer, it was well updated, nice furnishings, and very clean. You first enter the front room that includes a sleeper sofa, chair, desk/chair, 42\"? HD TV, bar with fridge an a couple of small tables. Just big enough for us. Next you enter (Center of unit) the bath area. Sink and dressing area across from separated tub/shower and toilet area/room. Last you find the bedroom. King bed (comfy), 2 night stands, 42\" flat HD TV, & closet. Off this room is a very small patio- nothing you could really use. Unit was nicely decorated, everything worked well, and was very clean. Very quiet resort and room, except for being woken up the first mornig by hammering in the room above us, alot of hammering! We were sleeping in that day(the room is very dark with drapes closed) andwe were unaware that it was 9am. Turns out they were laying carpet above us. Since it was after 9 we didn't complain. The grounds are average, you will find many fountains around the resort. What we really injied was the River Ranch. The River Ranch is included with your stay and includes a great pool area with waterfall, sports pool, jaccuzzi, lazy river, and large slide. Also there was mini golf. We enjoied the slide and lazy river the most, and played 2 rounds of mini golf at my grandson's insistance. We ate most meals on site at the Hole in the Wall restaurant, a dinner, a lunch and also breakfast. Food was good, really liked dinner, and the homeade potato chips! The staff was very, very nice, and our meal vouchers/certificates were a great deal. Also the sevice was so fast at all meals, and being mid week, we were nearly the only ones there.

We take advantage of this as the fee is less than the cost of boarding him. This resort is quite beautiful, and the water park tons of fun. This year our kids spent hours playing water volleyball, as there were always two pools with nets up in the main water park area. Our kids are too old to take advantage of the \"Coyote Camp,\" but when they were younger that was a real plus for us. There are also other pools, if you want to stay away from the kiddy crowd.

The hotel is a quick drive (about 10 mins) from Skyharbor, and is in a mostly residential neighborhood. There's a handful of restaurants around, and a good grocery store (Bashars) at the nearby big intersection. For me, the biggest attraction is that you are near Squaw Peak park (it has another longer name now) which is full of trails and desert, though a tad hard to get away from the highway noise. In fact, from you room you can walk into the park by following streets, paths, and an equestrian underpass to get to the other side of the highway, but it's nicer to drive the 10 minutes to get into the main vehicle entry to the park, as it's quieter and you are more surrounded by the local desert. Of course the desert is best in the early morning. The \"resort\" side of the hotel is limited. The lazy river and water slide are certainly good for a couple of rounds and my work meeting degenerated into a nice game of water volleyball.

If you are looking for a quiet and relaxing spa or adult weekend, this is not the hotel for you. If you are looking for great poolside service and fancy drinks with umbrellas, find another resort. As a Hilton Diamond Member, I am used to a level of service that this hotel does not offer. In fact, you will not receive anything special for being a loyal Hilton customer. So, Diamond members, do not look for a nice sit-down continental breakfast as it is not offered. Our two choices are to stand in line in the gift shop for dry cereal, and even drier donuts and coffee. Or, the other option is to pay for breakfast at the noisy and unorganized Rico's restaurant on-site. ROOMS: Our two-story king bed casita was very nice. It was clean and comfortable. I liked that we could park in covered parking right at the casita. The bed was comfortable and clean. The kitchenette, fridge, etc. were new and well-kept. Very nice room. Not five-star but nice. SERVICE: Checking in, we were greeted and received well. Quick service to our room. The restaurants and poolside service was terrible. None of the staff seemed interested in helping. Too bad because the hotel misses out on a lot of revenue from bar/alcohol sales. RESTAURANTS: Food was mediocre but prices were okay. Again, service was slow both before and after ordering. THE RIVER RANCH: This, and the other pools, are the hotel's saving grace. Our two-year-old had a blast. She loved the lazy river and the waterfalls. The pools were beautiful. They seemed manicured and the surroundings were also nice. Very nice. One complaint I read was that hotel guests were reserving poolside chairs and not sitting in them.

The \"water park\" is more of a water play area and has a nice lazy river, one slide, and a pool area - we felt it was geared for smaller kids so only used the lazy river and then headed back to our building's pool. With all the younger kids at the water play area, it kept the pool area quieter. As a runner, I found the hotel had two nice options for anywhere from a 3-6 mile run. About 1/2 mile from the hotel is a trail that runs along a canal and there are other runners and bikers so you don't feel alone. The other option I found was also 1/2 mile away, the Dreaming Downs park area with a nice path or even trail running. It is nice to find a place where you are not stuck running on the sidewalk beside traffic! The rooms were spacious and quiet. I liked having the toilet/shower separate from the sink area. You can also close off the bedroom and living room areas from the sink which is nice if there is an early riser. Overall we enjoyed our stay, the only negatives for our family was the crowded feeling by the pool area and people \"claiming\" their spots - but I imagine this might not be a issue if you stay during a non-peak time - and the other is the hotel not providing recycling containers by the poolside or in the rooms - you just throw everything away. If we ever get back to Phoenix, I would consider staying here again but I'd also shop around.", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, TN", "Title": "\u201cBEST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!\u201d", "Author": "dstheta4", "ReviewID": "UR101395223", "Content": "This was my first trip to Phoenix but definitely not my last. My peer and I had to plan an event for an area that we knew nothing about. We spent hours on the internet trying to find the perfect event that was in our budget. After speaking with David at the Concierge's desk of the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort we had the best activities imaginable planned in less than 10 minutes. He took care of EVERYTHING, transportation, food, and fun. I was excited before I arrived, but once I reached my room (king suite) I was blown away! This was the nicest room I had ever had the pleasure of staying in, and I have stayed in a lot. It had the feel of a mini apartment. I even had a dining area that seated 6 people, a bath and a half, plus a wet bar. It was fantastic! I hated to leave my room, but there was so much to do at the resort, swimming in the pool or the water park, tennis, shopping, dinning, and working out in the gym. It was spring break when I visited and the kids seemed to love it as well. Since I was traveling for work, I always try to schedule our stays near a great golf course to keep the boss happy. Believe it or not, he said that the course he played Stone Mountain (also set up by my friends at the resort concierge desk), was one of the best he has ever played on. The event that was scheduled for our group was a visit to a ranch in Black Canyon City. It was absolutely beautiful! Everyone that attended said they had the best time and really enjoyed the food. Overall, this has been the best trip I have had and I contribute that to the friendliness, cleanliness, and overall attitude of the entire staff at the resort.

The hotel is not in the main resort area around Scottsdale. It is a large property in West Phoenix. The property is well kept--great large pool area and smaller pool areas around the property. The property borders on a nice neighborhood and just a few blocks away are easy hiking trails. The front desk staff overall was great as was the male concierge (the female concierge was not as helpful--didn't appear to know much) We stayed in a Casita--a one bedroom bi-level with a efficiency kitchen and a small living room/dining room. The furniture was fine if slightly dated. The kitchen, however, had nothing. No utensils, no glasses (except two water glasses you would find in a hotel room) and a couple of styrofoam plates and plastic silverware. There wasn't even a bottle opener and it took forever to get one. So unless you were driving to the resort or willing to go out and buy kitchen supplies, other than having a refrigerator there was no advantage to having the kitchen. Both restaurants were mediocore to poor. Breakfast was particularly bad. There are a lot better choices close by including for breakfast. The bad news was the last day. We had not checked out--only left the room--and came back to find that almost everything had been taken out of the kitchen. It was very clear we hadn't left. An angry call to the front desk and housekeeping eventually led to the removed items being located, but by then we were late to the airport. To top it off, because of the volume of checkouts we were told that receipts weren't printing. After a relaxing three days it was a hurried, stressful departure. We were promised by the front desk manager that we would get it by e-mail by the end of the day. We also understood there would be some adjustment to the bill. Five days later I contacted the front desk manager because we still had not received a receipt. When it finally arrived there was no adjustment. A further contact to the front desk manager went unanswered. I finally wrote to the general manager and had a quick response; apology, and more than adequate adjustment to the bill. Had we not had the final day experience I would easily have given this hotel a \"4.\" Assuming that what happened to us was a fluke I would still recommend the hotel--particularly if you have kids. The prices are cheaper than equivalent hotels in Scottsdale and its just a 15 minute drive into downtown Scottsdale.", "Date": "January 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beaverton, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cNice resort for a stay in Phoenix.\u201d", "Author": "bobomejor", "ReviewID": "UR94763604", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for two nights while in town for the BCS National Championship. Sadly, our beloved Oregon Ducks lost to Auburn by a field goal... but you can't win everything, I suppose. We stayed in a two-room king bed suite, which was great, as it had two large 40-ish inch flat-screen TVs (one in the bedroom, and one in the living room area). I had brought my laptop and an HDMI cable, and I was able to watch videos directly from my laptop. There's a fee for Internet use, though, so I didn't stream Netflix or anything. We ran into one snag with check in. I had booked the Winter Escapes package that was being offered by Hilton, which includes breakfast vouchers each morning and a $50 resort credit. In full disclosure, I booked it at pre-paid rate on Hotels.com, but I checked my confirmation email to make sure that was indeed what I was to receive. After I checked in and got back to the room, I realized that I had not received the breakfast vouchers. I called the front desk and the woman who answered didn't seem to know what I was talking about. I told her that I had booked the Winter Escapes package and that my confirmation from Hotels.com clearly stated that it included the above perks. I even checked on Hilton's Web site before we left Oregon to make sure the package was legit... sure enough, I found it (with this hotel listed) here: http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/promotions/hi_winter/index.jhtml?cid=OM,HH,WinterEscape,Specials The employee said, \"I'll go ahead and do it,' which was nice... but, I'd rather have heard, \"Oh, yes, you're right... we have it right here.\" Same outcome... but I don't like the idea that I booked something, had a confirmation of it... only to be told, \"Well, we'll go ahead and do it\" as though I was being done a favor. I did appreciate that I didn't have to press the issue, but I would have preferred that it was just done right in the hotel's system in the first place. Oh well. It all ended well. And the breakfast at Rico's Grill (which was still listed by it's old name -- Lantana Grill -- on the breakfast voucher AND a wall map in the lobby, causing some confusion on our part... please fix this, Pointe Hilton!) was quite good. The voucher was good for the breakfast buffet or $16.95 from the regular menu. We tried the buffet the first day, and it was quite good, and included a made-to-order omelet station, pastries, eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, etc. The next day, we ordered off the menu, and again... the food was really good. The temperature was around 65 F when we were there, but nice and sunny. This is pretty balmy in January when you're from the Pacific NW and used to rain and overcast skies in the winter. So, we headed over to the River Ranch water park for some fun in the lazy river. This particular lazy river is rather *LAZY*... in that there is not a lot of water pressure (at least not when we were there). But, we still had a fun time because we had the park *almost* to ourselves, as this was definitely an off-season for the hotel. There are several pools, a hot tub, a mini-golf course (which we didn't try), and lots of fun things. I'd love to see it in the summer time. The hotel itself also has a few pools and hot tubs, which would be great for those who don't want to walk over to the River Ranch. Parking was free and easy. We were able to park less than a minute's walk from our room each time without hassle. Wi-fi is free in the lobby, but not accessible from most (if any) rooms. Since wired Internet access was like $12 a day, I just used my phone while we were there, except for once when I brought my laptop into the lobby to access a company server for work. Overall, I'd recommend this hotel. It was in a nice area, close to Piestewa Peak for a lovely hike... there's a 24-hour Wal-Greens down the street next to a grocery store... and lots of great restaurants in the Phoenix area (My advice: head to North Phoenix for some Chino Bandido. Chinese-Mexican fusion FTW!!).

The resort has mastered the delicate balance between a world class resort, highlighting all the expected ammenities seasoned travler would expect from a five star resort providing a respite from the grind of frequent travel and the reward of treating my children and wife to the luxury of a destination resort offering service and fun. The Pointe Squaw Peak highlights all the postive attributes of the Valley of the Sun. Nestled on the western slope of Squaw Peak, the afternoon sun showcases the meticulus native landscape with palms and catus, , the faux western town, the waterfall and fountains of cascading water put us in another world. It was as if we were on a moive set of showcasing the absolute best of the west. Outside our room was a semi-private pool and jacuzzi so my kids were able to enjoy the relaxing water in the evening hours. The Hole in the Wall resturant served 1st class food and western service. The staff at the River Ranch provided activities such as a water slide race and hula hoop contests, as well as a movie shown at dusk on a big scren brought in for the event. The tennis courts were in great shape, and the minuture golf was fun as always. The tempurature during our stay was chilly \u2013 (even for us cold hardened Coloradians), so we really appreciated the management kicking up the heat on the pools. There is no better value to treat a family with children of all ages or a couple looking for a get away. Some families plan their vacation with a hotel as a base and make side trips to attractions. For the price of a hotel room, the Pointe Squaw Peak gives you the total package \u2013 large comfortable rooms and plenty for the adults and kids to do on property. Highly recommend this resort hotel. PS \u2013 I recommend the hike up Squaw Peak. It\u2019s a relativly sturdy hike, 1.3 miles up (45 min hike) and only 2 miles from the property. This was our ninth consecutive stay at the Squaw Peak Hilton during the Thanksgiving holiday. I grew up in Tempe and my family has since moved to Gilbert. We celebrate Thanksgiving at my brother\u2019s house \u2013 quite a party with 30+ family members! My wife and kids so enjoy the hybrid of vacation at the resort and family time in the east valley. This trip, I noticed a different attitude on property. The Hole in the Wall menu and staff was better; the River Ranch was better, the property looked sharp.

This resort had a large swimming pool, lazy river and mini golf course which we tended to avoid due to a large number of children running around which didn't match up with our definition of relaxing. Nonetheless the \"Casita\" pool served the purpose of relaxation very well.

Room was very clean and the staff did a great job while we were there. Covered parking was great for the car since it was 105 most of our stay. Also got my Gold member free certificates for breakfast at the coffee shop (1 coffee or tea, one juice, soda or water and 1 baked good) that was a great deal, but you could also use them for the Lantina Grill breakfast buffet for additional $8. We went there and were shocked when it was kids eat free for summer, so ended up paying $16 for all four of us. Lantina Grill breakfast was great and had some form of tortilla and egg thing that was great. It gets better! Got a certificate for 6 to the Luau buffet at the pool on Sunday night for being a Gold member. Line was super long and we got there a little late, but the show and the food was really good (and we lived in Hawaii for 3 years). What a deal! (that is why I am loyal to Hilton!) It was hot, but we did pool in the morning and took a break in the afternoon and then back for night swimming. They have a nice putt putt that is part of the extra $2.25 package per day. Worth it. Lazy river was good and...well...really lazy. Sometimes it took some time to make it all the way around. Boys loved the slide and they had kids games at pool, a water slide race, etc. Poolside drinks were expensive I thought, but where aren't they. Staff was great for what interaction we had. My wife brought her own blowdryer and popped the breaker. Called the front desk since we had no lights and expected to sit there for an hour, but the maintenance guy was there in less than 5 minutes. If you are staying here, try out Jeff and Mike at AZ Hummer Tours. It was the highlight of our trip and they are great guys and a wonderful company. Casitas were recently done and had nice granite tops and a 4 top table, desk, 2 leather couches and flat screen TVs. Lots of pillows and we slept well. Wife got a pedicure treatment special at the spa for $50 and got manicure and margarita special for $15 on 1st night.

It was 115 degrees while we were there so the lazy river and the hotel pools were really warm, but the main pool at the River Ranch was cooled. Like some other reviews said, the water park was seriously lacking when it came to daily upkeep. Cups and towels left all over weren\u2019t picked up until the end of the day, some not even then. Rules weren\u2019t enforced as far as, \u201cNo swimming in the lazy river. Stay in your tube\u201d. If you wanted to float around in your tube, you were constantly being blocked or pushed out of the way by people not in tubes, but just playing around in the river. Nothing was ever said to anyone about it, and it was slightly annoying at first, but seeing how they didn\u2019t enforce that rule, I didn\u2019t feel bad breaking the rule about bringing in your own food and drinks. Food and drinks at the poolside restaurants and bar were way too pricey. The rest of the hotel was fine, clean rooms and nice staff. The refrigerator froze everything and we couldn\u2019t find an adjustment to lower the temp., and didn\u2019t bother to ask anyone how to do it. We never ate at any of the hotel restaurants. There are tons of places to eat close by. If you like sushi, try Moto Sushi about a mile up the road. During the week get there between 3 and 5 for happy hour. The only down side of Moto\u2019s was loud angry music. There is a McDonald\u2019s up the road for a cheap breakfast, and a grocery store to stock up on stuff for your stay. The WIFI is $12 per day, but we were able to find a signal and hook up without having to pay for subscribing. It was a weak signal and was hit and miss, but we used it to find some restaurants that we wanted to try. If you absolutely need to have internet, you may want to pay, but try it first and see what kind of signal you get. All in all, not a bad place to stay in Phoenix especially if you have kids.

The Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak property is comprised of desert style stucco structures, and it sits in the middle of a part of town that is largely small business parks. In terms of appearance, the Westin Kierland it isn't. Still, I think this hotel has a lot of good qualities that make it a good value, particularly in the summer months when rates are low. I was upgraded to a bi-level casita which was more than ample room for me traveling alone. The furnishings and fridge were older but there was nothing in disrepair and the room was clean. The casitas have dedicated parking right there which is handy. I had neighbors but I didn't hear them. My only complaint about the room is that the AC system was loud. But since it was effective in keeping the room at 73 when it was 105 outside it's a little hard to complain about this. The internet service was a bit dodgy and required occasional restarts; not sure why that was, but it was a bit frustrating. I had great service from the staff. Front desk, restaurant bar, poolside bar, all very friendly. I think this is always worth mentioning given how many uptight travelers and stressed out parents these people must have to deal with. I view the location of this hotel as a net neutral. It's pretty central to the overall valley; whether it's good for you depends on what you plan to do, obviously. I played golf in Mesa and Scottsdale and this property is sort of between those two places. There is a Walgreens and a grocery store right down the street which is handy. The main pool area gets much attention in the reviews, and rightfully so, as there is a lot of activity there during the day. As I was there in late July I'm sure I didn't see the type of crowds that others have seen in high season. From what I could see the pools and the \"lazy river\" were clean; I would defer to reviews from people who stayed in high season on these issues, though. The primary pool area really isn't all that big so I could see it getting very crowded in busy times. I would have liked it if more of this area had been open later, but I understand this is a costs and staffing issue. I didn't eat at the restaurants here. I'll defer to others on that. The restaurant at the front of the property appeared to have a pretty varied menu, though. Overall I think this is a good property, and a good value particularly in summertime.

When we were looking for activity they had a sports pool & miniature golf. If we were hungry or thirsty the pool bar had everything you could want ( I totally recommend the homemade salsa.) If we wanted something more relaxing the Lantana Grill offered salads and sandwiches & they also went out of there way to please my picky kids. My favorite pool is the one that was framed by our room where the kids could play & we could watch them from the convenience of our deck. Can it get better? They also offer coyote camp where the kids learned about the desert made crafts & just had fun. They also had a spa where my 10 yr old got an ice cream pedicure. All in all this was our best vacation ever, the staff was outstanding the concierge was extremely helpful and the maid service was great bringing us extra towels and shampoo. Also loved the available washer & dryer.

I have been staying at the Pointe hotels since I was a child. My mother had her wedding reception dinner here nearly 30 years ago. It's not the nicest resort in town, but it's usually a good value and always fun for all. That being said, 7/8/2010 will be the last stay for any of my family at either of the Pointe resorts. First of all, I booked a two bedroom casita in March and prepaid for it so it would be a reduced rate. It ended up being $20 less then the actual rate but oh well! At least I had the security of knowing I had the room. Living in Arizona, summer birthdays are not always easy- it's so hot. It has been our tradition to celebrate my birthday and now my daughters birthday at the Pointe Resorts. The staff has always been accomodating to guests and making us feel special. Yesterday was Cassidys 2nd birthday. We booked the casita specifically so we would have room for both grandmas to stay and a little room for some family and friends to enjoy Cassidys birthday. When we arrived- my pre-booked casita was not available. They told me I had only booked the queen one. I found the confirmation and they realized they were in err. \"Ok, that's indeed what you booked, but We don't have one available right now. They are cleaning the downstairs portion of the casita but you may enter thru the king entrance and we will let you know when it's ready.\" Well, at least I have the room right? So we decide to do this. When we unloaded all of our belongings and entered the open portion of the casita, it was cramped to say the least. But at least it was cool. But there were 6 of us with some other family on the way. I asked the maid to put my cake in the fridge downstairs. I got a glimpse of the downstairs portion and was in shock. Someone had a major party on there the night before- like furniture overturned, bottles everywhere, sticky floors- an absolute disaster. No way would these two poor maids get this cleaned up by 5. I vaguely remember the front desk guy saying the guests who were there had a late checkout. Yea, I see why;) We call the desk and to my surprise, we were moved- to a 2-bedroom casita right across the way! But why not in the first place? Before we'd unloaded our things, etc. But the front desk did say they would help up carry our things across the car port. And that we were closer to the pool! Wow! Super nice bell boy came and helped us out. We were settled by 5:30- but that hour and a half of unsettlement for my daughter was not good. If you have or have had a two year old you know what I mean;) When my husband called the desk this AM- we wanted a late checkout and maybe just an apology,he was given the run around by a very rude manager. They didn't do late checkouts(HMMMM) Did we want to stay another night in a suite room for $69? LOL at that(they had a coupon for next stay in a suite room for $79.) The guys acting like we want the whole thing comped which at the time I didn't .I did. I got on the phone and told him the same story I've just told and he laughed at me several times and mocked me when I said I am a service manager at a large corporation and I usually don't complain. He mocked me about having children. His tone of voice was sarcastic. He was absolutely awful. He said that the GM was too busy to help us and wouldn't be available to talk. They also charged us for phone calls when we had paid for the value pack. Including the long distance one when I asked him for the corporate #. And do they not have a 1-800#? I didn't expect much, but I don't expect to be laughed at. I don't expect for everyone to go above and beyond the way I would in a case like this, but rudeness is unacceptable I see in reviews on here and Yelp that they have service/maintenence issues. The water park was dirty and unattended to. Service/Food in park. -so so. I used to love this place and I'm sorry that a tradition is over. Oh well, I'll go to the AZ Grand next year.

We stayed for 2 nights - July 6 & July 7. The staff couldn't have been more helpful - our first room had a smoky smell, the second room had an extremely loud humming/buzzing noise from the air conditioning unit, so they moved us to a third, which was fine. Through it all, the staff was friendly and accommodating. More towels were brought up within minutes of us calling for them. We booked the hotel for $127/night, which included a full breakfast buffet at Lantana Grill - which was a nice little bonus. Now on to the River Ranch - this waterpark area made my 11 year old son declare \"This is my favorite hotel ever!!\" We were there during the week - so not too crowded or too crazy. The pool was clean, and they loved the waterslide and poolside games for the kids. For $2.25 total (not per person) our family played unlimited mini golf - it also included use of the tennis courts & fitness center, but we didn't use those. That was a great deal. The mini golf course wasn't super fancy, but clean and well kept. One more thing that was great - on our way out, we stopped to take a picture of us by the fountain behind the lobby in South Pointe. I accidently left my purse on a lounge chair. I realized it 5 minutes after we drove away. In a panic, I called the front desk, and one of the employees ran right out for me and found it still sitting there. He brought it to the front desk & we drove back quickly to get it. Little things like that really made me happy about the resort. My only suggestions would be - the rooms are a little dark. They're not outdated, but just a little dark. The smaller pool within the South Pointe area was filled with left over towels from the night before the next morning. Nothing had been cleaned up. My kids would have loved it if the River Ranch was open later than 8pm. We also noticed large groups of older teens wandering around without adults present. We didn't have any kind of problems at all or feel threatened, but were reluctant to send our kids out anywhere by themselves - even just to get ice. Overall, we loved the hotel and found the little things that we would change not bothersome enough to complain about them. I have stayed at the Phoenician with my husband's work (won't pay for it myself :), and the Pointe HIlton is not that type of place. If you're expecting superb luxury, this is not the place.

The casita was two floors with a rooftop deck, equipped with lounge chairs and patio table, kitchen (sink, fridge and microwave), dining room and living room with pull out bed. In addition to being close to the waterpark, we had smaller pools all around. The casita also had a carport which was a nice option.

Also, the screaming by the children was uncalled for. Playing, having a good time, I understand. But for parents to allow children to just scream bloody murder, disturbing everyone else is just inconsiderate. I tried three different areas to avoid this type of event, but they were everywhere. I think parents just grow accustomed to the yelling and screaming and don't even realize what happens. I stayed on two occasions in June and this was common. For this reason, I think the hotel should have an adult only/ business area where such events are limited. It would be much better for those of us who need a more subdued environment to work in and relax. The staff was very kind and helpful when I needed assistance with business matters.

The apartment is good with a living room, fridge, coffee maker, but no safe and on old box TV which will be replaced soon they said. The bedroom is a good size but bathroom is tight. Plenty of onsite close parking. There are pools for each block as well as the water park which is great. Only annoying thing is the tendency to close off part of the best area at weekends for private parties and at weekends the numerous kids who run riot as their parents allow it. The grounds are great and all is nice and clean so no complaints. As experienced Hilton users, we tend to ignore their restaurants but I have the best tip ever here. Across the road is a pub restaurant called Gallachers where you can feel right at home. The extensive menu is great, food quality is brilliant, and the costs are reasonable. The service here is great with all the girls doing a great friendly job and in particular I compliment the manager Ben Lira who wants to know you and treats all his customers really well. This is often the Scottsdale way where people have a great sense of customer relations. You would hardly know Gallachers is there because it looks like an office but is is the best kept secret which needs a flashing sign. Another good one is the Olive Garden on Cactus Road Anyway, back to the Hilton where we decided to stay on for an extra couple of days at a room rate of $109. The hotel is very worthy of a visit particularly for families and for couples, weekdays are best.

All in all, a very nice property with good value for the money. Obviously, being June in Phoenix with the average temperature over 100 degrees, not high season, although it seemed like there were a fair amount of people staying there. The rooms were nice, we had a basic suite with a living area and separate bedroom. The bedroom was a bit small but room enough with the LR area for us to spread out. Clean and pretty quiet. We paid $149/night which included $50/day in resort dining certificates. I looked at other options in Phx/Scottsdale for the same time and the Hilton was the best price for what we wanted to do. From an activity standpoint, the water park is pretty comprehensive. There are 2 decent size pools, each with a volleyball net. One pool has a waterfall which was kind of cool. The other was designated the \"Sports Pool\" and also had a basketball hoop. The lazy river was just fine as it was a perfect current for just lazing in a tube and floating along, I don't think it was designed with high speed rafting in mind. It did get somewhat crowded and there were always kids going by but that's who the resort caters to. The water slide left a lot to be desired, not very long and certainly not very steep (the first half of your ride you were just trying to get going). The putt-putt course was pretty boring if you compare it to miniature golf only properties but fun nonetheless and we weren't charged extra. Food was good. Lantana Grill was the only full service restaurant open while we were there (Hole in the Wall was closed for renovation which we didn't discover until we walked up to the door - no mention on the website which would have been nice). We ate all 3 meals there during our stay and all were excellent. We ordered lunch one day by the pool and it was OK - prices seemed high for what we got, especially the drinks but we did have our coupons. We played golf twice at the Tapatio Cliffs property (sister Hilton resort 10 minutes away) and it was a nice course, not too crowded and inexpensive (June in Phoenix). I saw on other reviews that the internet charge was out of line. I didn't have a laptop but agree that free internet seems to be the norm today. I did look into the business center when I wanted to go online to find out about a local attraction and they wanted something like $3/minute for internet access which was ridiculous. You can print boarding passes for free there though. Other than that, I think the resort is a great family getaway at a reasonable price. There are probably nicer places with upgraded amenities in the area, but you'll pay a lot more.", "Date": "June 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, TN", "Title": "\u201cOverall good for the money and for kids\u201d", "Author": "TeamRyNashville", "ReviewID": "UR65865703", "Content": "We stayed here May 25-29 and did enjoy our stay.

The hotel is over 30 years old, but other than a few things it was hard to notice...I am not sure where the $20 million in upgrades were spent, as this is the first time I had stayed there. We decided to not rent a car on this trip, so took a cab from the airport and it was a short 15 minute drive directly north that cost about $34 there and flat fee $30 back. The staff at the Hilton were very accomodating from the moment we arrived, handling all our bags and taking us by electric car to our casita. Our room was two levels and had a kitchen area right in the entrance area, a large dining room and family room. Upstairs were a pair of queen beds and a fairly large tiled patio. On the hottest days, the patio surface was so hot that you must wear shoes or burn your feet. We loved the curtains in the upstairs area as they let us sleep in as late as we wanted, it made our room very dark. The casita that we were in had a terribly uncomfortable pullout queen bed downstairs, but two lush queen beds upstairs. Every time our next door neighbour took a shower the noise downstairs from the piping was loud, and there was not great sound proofing between rooms. The kitchen was not as expected. It contained a coffee maker, microwave and fridge/freezer. There was nothing as far as cutlery, plates, or dishes of any kind...making it very difficult to prepare anything. The fridge was old, the freezer area had a broken plastic door and barely kept the ice cream we purchased frozen. There was no toaster and we had to ask for a bottle opener. My wife decided to go out and purchase some food for lunches/breakfast and the bell hop (Reuben) was fantastic, driving her there in the hotel van (about 5 minutes away was a Fresh and Easy) and picking her up again in 20-30 minutes when she was finished...he drove her back to our casita and even helped her unpack the food. I had to go out to the local Basha's and purchase some mustard and dish washing detergent. It was about a 10 minute walk to both Basha's and Walgreen's. Also a short walk away was a great Italian restaurant (we had dinner there, great service and food), a Chinese restaurant, Gallagher's (a sports bar), Aunt Chilada's (mexican) and a pizza place. The main purpose for our stay was to entertain two boys, 7 and 4, that is why we selected this property. The hotel had lots of smaller pools in quiet areas, and an amazing water complex. This water complex kept our boys busy from early in the day until 5pm every day. They played basketball, mini golf, floated around the lazy river and played in lots of pools. There were lots of other children there of all ages and on the weekend there was quite a contingent of teenagers as well. We met a couple from Phoenix who had come there for a relaxing/romantic weekend to celebrate an anniversary, but that is not the way I would spend my anniversary. I think this hotel caters to kids and teenagers perfectly, but after 8pm when the pool area shuts down, the hotel becomes a bit of a ghost town. The hotel has started to charge for mini gold by instituting a $2.25 daily per room fee for using the mini golf, fitness center and a few other things. The lazy river is very lazy and it was hot, so it was a good way to stay cool. The hotel was totally packed on Saturday and Sunday and fairly quiet the other days, but at no time did we have any lineups. We also found chairs and loungers at all times of the day in contrast to some other reviews saying that people lined up at 8am and that there were never any chairs to sit on. The waterslide was good, but our 4 yr old missed being able to ride on it by about one inch in height. We did not bring a laptop, but the hotel did charge for high-speed internet (what a ripoff) and the business centre was well equipped but charged a steep fee for use. We dined at the Hole in the Wall restaurant for our first lunch and it was good but not outstanding. We dined at Lantana Grill for dinner twice and breakfast once. The breakfast was excellent, and the dinners were good....both dinners the place was almost deserted, one night because they had a free hoe-down (food included with your hotel stay). We also had dinner at Aunt Chiladas one night, it was busy and food was plentiful and affordable. We had a blown fuse incident one night, but the maintenance staff showed up very quickly and had it fixed just as fast. Every time we came across the staff they were always smiling and saying hello. We ordered a slush drink for the boys at Slim Pickins (poolside cafe), and were a little shocked to pay $6.50 ($7.50 after tip). Overall we loved the place and would go back again. It is great for families, and we saw many families there with parents and grandparents and groups of families too. Teens would love it there too, many of them in the lazy river, and sunning and chatting with friends and checking out the bikinis/bathing suits.

That's why we keep coming back. Not this time! In order to get a lounge chair at the pool, you had to go down and get in line 45 minutes before it opened at 8 am. Then if you wanted to get morning coffee in the coffee shop, you got into another 30 minute line. Just forget about trying to get into the restaurants. Parking was next to impossible sometimes. The entire resort seemed to be understaffed, over-occupied and just in a state of complete chaos. (Although the front desk was always manned pretty well and friendly.) They advertise that they are \"newly remodeled\". Well, take it from folks that have been coming here for years...the rooms were not as spacious or clean as they used to be. They weren't horrible...they just used to be a lot better. They certainly are not up to par with what one expects from a Hilton resort. They remind me more of the quality you get at a Red Roof Inn. The bed we had was uneven, so we felt as though we were going to roll off to the right all night. That took some getting used to. The room next to us had a family of 8 people + a dog packed into it. The dog barked so much we ahd to call the front desk and have security sent. Overall, this was not the relaxing vacation we expected. It is now only an \"OK\" resort, and a bit like Disney where everything requires you to get in a line.

The living room area had a double pull out sofa bed which was very comfortable, then you walked through to the bathroom and a seperate wash basin area. The Queen bed was fab. The belcony overlooked a courtyard which held a wedding during our stay. the room had an empty fridge, a coffee machine (tea/coffee topped up daily) also 2 tvs which was handy The front of the room overlooked 1 of the smaller pools but it was 3/4ft-6ft and a little deep for my son. The Lazy river..... it was about a 5/10 min walk and if you did not queue up to get in from around 0730 then the chances of getting a sun lounger were very slim!! i was amazed to see a long queue at 0740 one morning. I had no problems taking in drinks and snacks, my son has lots of allergies so always take my own things. Food on the site was expensive and the portions were not huge. $3 for a small box cereal, $3 for 4 thin slices of bacon, \u00a36 for an ice cream $4 for pancakes and they were the cheap items. soft drinks were \u00a33 each. crazy golf was free and was fun. The lazy river was nice to go around but when it was busy it was busy!!! We hired a car from ALamo which was a lifesaver. we went shopping, to get food etc and did 345 miles in 8 days. there is a walgreens and bashers about a 5 min DRIVE from the hotel which sells everything from food to drinks/pharmacy/swimming stuff etc. there is also a subway /nail bar /mcdonalds. went to fashion square to the mall there but it was expensive so i found a good outlet mall called ARIZONA MILLS its about 25 min drive. The concierge team in the hotel are great and full of knowledge, wherever you want to go they wiull know about it and have directions for you, trust me the team are the best i have met. Also visited a cowboy themed restaurant rustlers rooste, sawdust on the floors cowboy band playing, huge ribs rattle snake is a must steaks etc... was about $78 for 2 adults 1 child. the beef ribs were eat as much as you want. walmart is open 24hours one on both ends of bethany home road, this was handy to stock up on breakfast bits and cold drinks, for the fridge in the room. The fridge did seem to freeze things it was a little tempremental at times. i would recommend taking plastic bowls for cereal. our stay was from the 04th-13th April and it was busy! i dont think i would stay during this period again. All of the hotel staff were very courtious and happy to help The hole in the wall needs to lower its prices. A car is a must really unless you like walking in the extreme heat. The shops are located on lots of little retail parks so you need to drive from 1 to the other. There is a cheescake factory about 20 mins away $6.95 for a slice. cigarettes were $5.99 for malboro light but dont forget to add tax. everything has tax added to it at the end of your bill, so dont forget that. Banks will not exchange currency unless you bank with them, we went to an amex travel center on 22nd street but the rate was $1.41 per \u00a31 plus a $6 service charge.

I'll start with what was great... The room set up is IDEAL for a family of four with kids that are able to share the pull-out sofa (which by the way was the most comfortable pull-out bed I've EVER laid on!). We bought breakfast basics and utilized the mini-fridge. I recommend bringing a few plastic bowls, a cutting board and small knife from home and you're all set. The River Ranch water park is so fun for the kids. The activities they have scheduled for the kids happen every few hours and our kids loved it. The mini-golf course was super fun as well. The overall set-up and location of this hotel is pretty ideal if you ask me. You're close to so many things and we even did a great hike right from the resort. Here's what brought some disappointment... the front desk staff was less than stellar every time we dealt with them. After trying to get into our room for five minutes (no keys worked) I went down to the front desk to ask for help, which wasn't close by, and was informed that we were told the wrong room number. Oops. No apology. No \"I'm sorry for the inconvenience\" or anything. I wasn't looking for any sort of freebie but just a general recognition for the inconvenience this caused... not to mention the people we totally freaked out by trying over and over again to get into their room! The River Ranch, as fun as it is, was so crowded it was hard to relax. Come prepared to play \"the game\" if you come for spring break.... i.e. get up EARLY to get chairs. The RR opened at 8:00 a.m. and I went over at 7:30 a.m. (after hearing that you had to get their early to get chairs). I was the 50th person in line. Seriously. It was ridiculous but the alternative was to not have chairs there. There are signs that say you \"must have someone stay with your reserved chairs at all times\" but that was absolutely NOT the case. It also said \"no outside food or drink allowed\" and yet everyone had snacks. This totally wasn't a problem for me but it became a problem when my 11 year old daughter, who went back to the room to get a box of crackers to bring back to snack on, was turned away at the entrance. Someone told her she couldn't bring in outside food and she had to walk all the way back to the room to return the crackers. This made us pretty upset considering everywhere you look there are people eating \"outside\" snacks, making PB & J's, drinking coffees from Starbucks, etc. Really? You're going to pick on a little kid who doesn't know to \"hide\" her outside food when she walks in? Ridiculous. The food we did purchase that same day for lunch from the poolside menu was borderline unedible. We are not usually picky people. We're generally just so happy to be on vacation that not much bothers us but there was enough issues on this trip that I doubt we'll return to this location. We possibly could have had a random experience but service is everything these days. It doesn't go unnoticed by our family.

The Hole in the Wall staff was nice enough to change their TV's so we could watch the NCAA games on Saturday night; Aunt Chilada's did the same on Monday.

We waited at check in, breakfast at the hole in the wall, breakfast at Lantana, to get into the pool, to speak with the (wonderful) concierge, it seemed everywhere on the premises! Our check in was less than stellar and I think that started the vacation off in a bad way. My husband is a diamond member, yet we still waited over 30 minutes to check in. It was so busy. With his status we were not upgraded, which was fine it was spring break, but the desk worker was rude, and gave my husband major attitude when he asked if they had any openings during our visit if he could be called. We weren't given the proper # of meal ticket (gets with his upgraded status) and the list goes on... We only found one nice person at the front desk late one evening. The hotel makes the extra perks that diamond status gives very difficult. If you want your free bottles of water hike out to the gift shop near river ranch. Your free breakfast vouchers can be redeemed only at the gift shop in the main lobby which had a slim selection of crummy pastries. But for an extra $7 you can again hike to the Lantana grill wait in line for the overpriced buffet then miss out on getting a sun lounger unless you are up super early which isn't fun on vacation. We were in a standard room in the south tower which was adequate and clean. It reminded me of a upgraded Embassy Suites. The room was very humid and hot whenever we re-entered... Beds and linens were clean and comfortable and my son said the pull out was comfortable. The bathroom layout is a little funky with the toilet/bathtub area being super small, but it wasn't a problem. The grounds were beautiful and well maintained, and the cleaning staff were friendly, but most days our room wasn't cleaned till after 4:00. The river ranch was fun, but way too crowded! I had to see 3-4 verbal fights over saved lounge chairs. People were getting up super early to reserve seats, and by 930 you couldn't find a seat. The spa and pools were crowded with so many people and by the end of the day the water was green with half of inch of sunscreen, yuck! The lazy river was super busy as and many times I felt it was like bumper boats. River ranch food was overpriced for what you got, and I saw many families bringing in outside food (supposedly not allowed.) The children's activities for spring break were fun and my son enjoyed those. My son attended Coyote kids club for one day and truly LOVED it. It was the highlight of his trip! Although the cost was slightly steep the teachers were fantastic, and he made amazing art projects and had alot of fun. I highly recommend it!

Everyone who works there was very friendly and accommodating, and there are lots of different activities to choose from to keep kids busy. When we arrived on a Friday night, we had a delicious dinner at the Lantana Grille and then walked over to the River Ranch where a kids' movie was being shown. We enjoyed playing the 18-hole miniature golf course that lined the banks of the lazy river, and the kids' activities at the pool every hour during the afternoons were well done. There are so many lounge chairs around the various pools that there was never a problem finding a couple of chairs together no matter what time you ventured to the pool area. The pools at the North Pointe and South Pointe buildings were a quiet respite when wanting a change from the River Ranch's active environment. One thing I really liked was that the resort fee was optional and really very small (less than $3 a day) and you could add it on any day during your stay if you decided to take advantage of things like golf, tennis, or the fitness center (which was very well equipped). The breakfast buffet at the Hole in the Wall was delicious and a good deal, as was the weekend barbecue buffet at the pool. Menu items at the Slim Pickens poolside bar were very good, with generous portions, and the poolside waiters were friendly and prompt. The bar and grille across the street (Gallagher's) was nice for a relaxed dinner, and had so may flatscreen TVs it would be impossible to miss any of your favorite sports. The mexican restaurant just off the property (Aunt Chilada's) had excellent food - loved the unusual chips and salsa. We only ate at the Lantana breakfast buffet once, and although it was good, the line was too long to wait for the one cook who was doing all the made-to-order food. The concierge staff was quite helpful; we enjoyed a great horseback ride at Cave Creek thanks to their suggestion. Even the bellman gave us tips on things to do while there at the hotel. The property is clearly older, but well maintained. It has the feel of an apartment or condo complex more than a hotel. We stayed in a standard suite with a king bed and a queen sleeper sofa.

They provided extra thick lounge cushions making it very easy to fall asleep while sunning--again, relaxing. Pool towels were provided in abundance--as many as you needed or liked. I like extra so that was sweet. They have servers from the bar/restaurant area should you desire refreshments delivered right to your chair--Hi Jessie!--she was great. This resort has very nice landscaping, lots of greenery, sort of surprising and again exceeded my expectations. Restaurant called \"Hole in the Wall\" has a daily happy hour 4-6. Order the veggie sandwich and sweet potato fries--awesome. They also have Blue Moon beer on tap served with the signature orange slice and it goes great with the sandwich. The Hole in the Wall has a fabulous outdoor patio with a fireside pit area--very nice. We tried the other restaurant and ordered salads--just okay. Walk outside the front of the resort turn left and follow the chili peppers painted on the side walk about 1-2 blocks. This leads you to the GREATEST Mexican food restaurant called \"Aunt Chiladas\". This is an old historical structure and has a fantastic outdoor patio seating area. The food is great and reasonably priced. Please go--trust me, you will not regret it. I wish we had found it sooner because we would have been frequent visitors :) We have stayed at many 4-5 star resorts and this one ranks right there with them. We will definitely return again. If you go, be sure to say \"hi\" to David Richardson at the front desk and Brad Wills in Shipping, they are a couple of great employees and will add to your stay :)", "Date": "March 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel but needs some upgrades\u201d", "Author": "dglbltrvlr", "ReviewID": "UR57781420", "Content": "I am a Diamond HH member and was upgraded to an Ambassdor suite.

True house--big place, 2-car garage, gorgeous sweeping views of city/mountains on one side, but the house is cut into mountain so no view on one other side plus the rain just poured in there.

Shower head is 4 feet ground, so anybody over 5'2 has a not so fun time in the shower. As an upgrade, the place was amazing, but to rent? At $2k-$3k per night? Ridiculous. No way. However, entire resort staff could not have been more gracious or accommodating, even when we accidentally locked ourselves out of the house and trudged (through pouring rain and 70-mph-winds) to the restaurant (about 1/4 mile away) to be saved. Narrow road up mountain to house; staff takes you there in a golf cart or van. Awoke in a.m. to find bedraggled, water-soaked coyote trying to make his way up the mountain from our patio. Somehow grand, yet pathetic/sad at the same time. Kind of the perfect metaphor for the whole stay. Dinner at Hole in the Wall; decent appetizers (potato skins; deep-fried Southwest \"spring rolls\") but entrees (filet mignon; ribeye; chicken-fried elk) were pretty bad, as in \"probably frozen/microwaved.\" Margarita seemed watered-down, but kicked my butt.

The River Ranch staff is overly accommodating with the games they host throughout the day. My kids always seem to win a smoothie or a cheeseburger. They even set up a movie projector on Friday nights - last time showing Pocahontas. 2- The semi private pools: After the day of swimming, my wife and I relax in the over-sized room while the kids swim in the semi-private pool that is shared by only a few guest rooms. 3 - The staff and clean rooms: The housekeeping and maintenance staff are invisible, but the room and property is always clean. I have to wonder if Disney doesn't secretly send their staff to the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort for training. 4- The restaurant. We are always impressed with the quantify and quality of food served at Hole in the Wall restaurant, and the friendliness of the staff there. 5 - The gym and spa First rate with ample exercise equipment.

My wife enjoys the spa each time we come, and says this is her favorite place to get a massage. 6- Proximity to hiking and climbing. We clime Squaw Peak each time we stay at the property. A relatively short hike from the room, about 2 1/2 hours round trip. Amazing we can be so close to the mountains ans so convenient to all the good shopping Phoenix has to offer. 7 - and most important, the HERO factor.

First, the location is the best. We like to be outdoors and active. The hotel is situated on a bike/running path which connects to Dreamy Draw Recreation Park. Dreamy Draw Park has many miles of running/walking, biking paths which are both paved, or natural mountain trails. We preferred the paved trails, but many prefer the natural so you never fee like the trails are crowded. Next, the hotel is located just a mile or so from Squaw Peak. If you like to hike, this is perfect. You are there in minutes by car. Squaw peak is a good work out - I think the summit is about 1.2 miles. The path up is a good work out (we climbed 3 times) and you are always in the sun so even if it's cool out (50 degrees for us) you're plenty warm. The climb is moderate to difficult, but most people can handle it if you are careful. Definitly do it - the scenery of the entire valley is gorgeous! We also climbed Camelback Mountain during our stay which is about 3 miles from Squaw Peak. Camelback Mountain is much more difficult and challenging to climb. We saw people of all ages and conditions climbing both, but if you are not in good shape Camelback Mountain may not be much fun, and instead it will be a stressor for you. More about the hotel - we do not have small kids, so the lazy river water area was not a draw for us. However, we met many people with young kids and talked to them. Everyone said they had a great time. The water was kept warm, so even with 50 and 60 degree weather the kids and parents used it and had fun. The hotel pools were warm water too, and the hot tubs were really warm. You could see steam rising from the water during the cool mornings and evenings. Also, there are so many different pools and hot tubs that we neveer felt it was crowded, or we didn't want to use them because of too many people. The hotel rooms are big, with good TVs and room sizes. The staff does a great job of keeping the rooms and grounds spotless. As a matter of fact - the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. My wife and I travel quite a bit, and you usually run into a person or two who does not understand custumer service at hotels. Squaw Peak Hilton - every staff member was friendly, helpful, smiles and a hello, ready to help anyway they can. My wife and I also like to exercise. The hotel Spa and Fitness center was the best. This fitness center also has local members who use it. It is the best, most up to date, state of the art facility I have ever used at a hotel. If you pay the extra $2.50 a day charge, you can use the fitness center, and tennis courts for no additional charge. This is a bargain, make sure you do it. It has free weights, machine weights, many top notch treadmills with built in TVs, stationary bikes and stair masters, exercise classes, steam room, full showers and lockers. The fitness center is a short walk (1 minute) from the hotel lobby - truly outstanding facility. It is big enough that again, even though many people were using it, we felt like we had it to ourselves. Never had to wait for a machine etc.. I strongly recommend this hotel for anyone who is visiting the Phoenix area!!", "Date": "December 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "seattle,wa", "Title": "\u201cMemory Book,s..pictures my memory took.\u201d", "Author": "dinamercille", "ReviewID": "UR52059722", "Content": "My husband and I took our son and daughter to Arizona for 2 reasons. #1 to purchase our new home and # 2 to fullfill a\" Bucket List\" for my husband who has been given 9 months to live due to liver cancer.

It turns out that I did. The purpose of the trip was a romantic getaway for me and my husband before we have our second child that I'm expecting in less than 3 months. Many folks who reviewed said that this was not a good romantic choice. I think that depends on when you choose to go. I chose to stay on a Sunday night in September because I figured that all of the kids would be in school and so there would be very few families left in the hotel. I found this to be true. However, I can imagine that this place is a zoo during the summer, but any place with a water park is going to be like that during the hot summer months in AZ. I chose this hotel because of all of the amenities and the ability to stay in a Casita. The thought of being in our own \"little house\" really appealed to me. Although I had been warned by others that the Casitas were actually a couple of apartment-like structures put together, it still felt like we were in our own little world. It wasn't like being in a regular hotel room where you can hear every toilet flush and coming and going of your next door neighbors. The covered parking right behind each Casita makes your car drivable after being in the sun. There was also a small private pool right next to our one-bedroom King (bed) Casita. The inside was very nicely decorated. The large refrigerator, microwave and sink/bar area were perfect for quick snacks and it was fun to have the bedroom area on a separate floor from the kitchen table, desk area and couch/TV area downstairs. Upstairs was nice as well with a place to lounge as well as a bed and another bathroom. Other reviewers were correct about the door to the toilet area being nearly impossible to close due to its proximity to the toilet itself, but with a 2 yr old at home I'm used to not having privacy in the bathroom! I had hoped to spend time walking the grounds, but we got too busy. Fortunately we had a great view from our small balcony and from the first floor of our Casita. I didn't visit the Spa at the Squaw Peak resort as I had planned, but instead the spa at the sister property at Tapatio Cliffs (they had a Spa Week discount on a particular treatment). I had an aromatherapy/maternity massage. I haven't had many spa treatments so I don't have much to compare it to, but the staff seemed very professional and it was an overall positive experience. There is a free shuttle between the two properties but it only leaves on the hour from one hotel and half hour from another so it may not work if you don't want to wait or arrive early. So overall I was very happy with my stay. Next time I'll book at least 2 nights so I can experience the water park, mini golf, and restaurant. Other positive notes: friendly staff, discounted rate by booking 21 days in advance (non-refundable), ability to check-in 2 hours early simply by calling, close proximity to a mall (Desert Ridge Marketplace - 15 min) and my husband was thrilled at the number and variety of channels on TV.", "Date": "September 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds", "Title": "\u201cNice, quiet hotel - best for relaxing.

Our room was nice and roomy, very clean and had everything we could want. Only downside was that the balcony was very small and was on the back of the hotel so was very dark and had trees overhanging it so we weren't able to sit out. Hole in the Wall restaurant was very nice to eat breakfast - amazing choice for $15 dollars and yes there were busy times but nothing too bad. HitW also served lunch and dinner overlooking the main pool which was nice. The one thing that spoilt the first couple of days for us was the children at the resort..... we did go over Labor Day so did expect it to be busy, but the amount of unsupervised children was ridiculous. We stayed away from the main pool with the lazy river and stayed in the North Pointe pool, but that was just as bad with the kids (and the parents in some cases!!).

Small pool with jacuzzi (not working whilst we were there but nice to use as hot tub) and swim up bar. For those wanting bigger pool there was the main one with the slide and lazy river but the small quiet one suited us. As we didn't have a car, there wasn't much we could do as the hotel is quite isolated but the hotel were great at helping us sort out an evening in downtown Pheonix to see the D-Backs baseball team (excellent evening, highly recommend this, even to non sports lovers.

We booked 2 rooms (1 kingsize and 1 two queensize beds) thru internet. Everything went fine and we got the requested rooms. Rooms (sorry: \u201csuites\u201d) are rather large with a living room, a separate bath/toilet and sink bathroom and a sleeping room. Be aware that kingsize bed suites are smaller than regular 2 queensize beds. Cleanliness of rooms is OK, but you could expect better from Hilton. Value is very good if you can get summer deal prices. On our second stay, we requested extended check-out time (3 pm) for an extra charge of 35$. We were told at check in that it was OK and that we just had to call the front desk the morning of our departure. When I called, I was told that it was not possible because the hotel was full! Pretty strange as the official check-in time is 4 pm. After discussion, we were eventually able to stay until 3 pm. Breakfast by the pool at the \u00ab Hole in the Wall \u00bb restaurant is nice, providing you come very early (7 am) to avoid the crowds of people who consider that a buffet is a all-you-can-eat-contest and leave you with the leftovers and stained napkins. The buffet is good, but rather pricey ($15+tip+tax). There was a convention going on while we were there the second time, and unfortunately the attendees were noisy. They stayed in the inner pool area for hours, shouting & laughing. I asked them to quiet down several times, but without success. But the real downturn of that resort is the crowd that gathers on weekends. The beautiful and quiet pools suddenly turns into a real mess. There were always tons of unsupervised children and teens in the lazy river, swimming (though forbidden), shouting and disrupting everybody. We also found disgusting that food and drinks seems to be allowed around (and even within) the pool. My advice: go there during the week providing there is no convention going on.

We also liked the \"newly renovated\" description as well as the many photos shown. When we got there, we found that what we got did not look like the photos. Don't get me wrong, this hotel is ok and nice, and if you didn't have anything to compare it to, it would be fine, but it doesn't seem to be what you normally find with Hilton Hotels. The buildings seem to be spread out and confusing. We arrived very late, and though we had a map AND directions, had a difficult time finding our room. Directions that are second nature for hotel staff take awhile for guests to figure out. A trip to the main lobby for coffee was a \"field trip\" from our room. One time, while coming from a different direction, I really got lost and it took some time to figure out where I was because buildings tend to look the same. The suites/rooms were described as \"spacious,\" but as a family of four, we found ourselves tripping over each other because the room was much smaller than presented in the photos, and the one bed extended into the doorway between the living and sleeping area. The bathroom was also very small. When we called the front desk upon arrival, they were very nice, but we were told that all the room and bathroom sizes were this size. In addition, the room we had did not look at all newly renovated, and in fact it looked worn and not quite as spotless as I would like. (i.e. dust on door crevices, some spots on rug, floor, etc.) The front desk confirmed that all the rooms were newly renovated. There was a convention going on while we were there. Our room was near an elevator, (doors go to the outside not hallways) and needless to say the conventioneers were noisey. My husband had to ask them to quiet down several times, because there seemed to be no soundproofing, & noise carried right into the room. Again, they weren't doing anything wrong, just talking, but the nights were late ---and the noise definitely carried. The description of the slides at the water park says \"slides.\" There was only one slide, (if there were two we never found the second one) and they were probably not as fun of a slide as anticipated. Several times down the slide and we had our fill. The lazy river and pool area was nice, but not as fresh and new looking as the photos. There were always tons of small and what appeared to be unsupervised children in the lazy river. Many weren't following the rules of using inner tubes, and no staff person said anything about this at all. One other note is there seemed to be a lot of staired walkways to go from point A to point B. If someone has difficulty with stairs, they would find it hard to get around the pool/ waterpark area. The staff overall was very nice. A very pleasant surprise was \"Slim Pickens\" --the pool restaurant/ food service. The food there was absolutely out of this world outstanding---hands down better than the other restaurants on the premises. I would go back there anytime to eat. It was expensive, like the other restaurants, but well worth it. The spa was also and excellent experience. While in Phoenix, we checked out other hotels that showed up as options when we were booking this hotel, and though their photos looked worse online, the hotels in the same star or price range were much more outstanding. This hotel is ok, but honestly, we probably wouldn't choose it again if we take another vacation in Phoenix or recommend it to a friend. My daughter summed it up when she said, \"Compared to the other hotels we looked at with the same star rating while there,(key word compare) this one really shouldn't have the same number of stars. \" If you don't have anything to compare this to, or previous experience with Hilton Hotels, you would probably say the hotel is ok.", "Date": "August 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durant, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cOasis in the desert!\u201d", "Author": "Rebekahj0", "ReviewID": "UR38065479", "Content": "We were only here for one night, but if we could have stayed longer we would have!

The first time was last year and the experience was not quite up to the hype. Unfortunately, things have not gotten much better, and I will probably never return again. Decided to take my wife the first night to celebrate our anniversary, then have our children join us the second night and go to the River Ranch (the waterpark). I had made arrangements for an early check-in at 1:00pm. Upon our arrival at 1:00pm, only the King bedroom part of the two-bedroom, two-story casita was ready, and I was told that we could check-in to that part, then when the rest of it was ready, the hotel would bring over the new room keys. We waited until 4:00pm with no word and no keys. I then walked back over to the front desk, only to be told by another front desk clerk that she didn't know if the rest of our casita was ready yet or not, and she would have to call and find out. I waited in the lobby nearly fifteen minutes while someone went to the casita and checked. Apparently, it had been done earlier and nobody told us or brought us the new keys. Strike One. While waiting in the lobby, I called room service and ordered dinner to be delivered to the room as a nice suprise for my wife. I ordered one filet, one salmon and a bottle of Pinot Grigio. After returning to the room, I received a call from room service stating that they were out of salmon and would I like to make another choice. Out of Salmon at 4:00pm on a Thursday??? Whatever. So I ordered two filets. Delivery was scheduled for 7:45pm. My wife and I had a 6:00pm appointment for a couples massage at the Tocasierra Spa. Upon our arrival, we were greeted with signs that said that the air conditioning was broken (late-May in Phoenix ... 102 degrees for a high that day) and they apologized for any inconvenience. We asked to see the actual therapy room first, and while it was a bit warm and the fans were very noisy, which drowned out the background music, the massages were very good. 50 minute couples massage ... $200 plus gratuity. The men's locker room was a mess, though, with old wet towels all over the floor and trash overflowing in the waste paper cans. Upon returning to the room, room service called and said they were out of the Pinot Grigio, and would I like some other wine instead. So I ordered a Chardonnay. Then I added a cheesecake and an order of chocolate-covered stawberries. At 7:50pm, room service called and said the food was on its way. It arrived moments later. To be honest, the filets were outstanding! Hot, juicy and tender. The mashed potatos and asparagus spears were good as well. The cheesecake was okay ... a bit dry and crumbly. The chocolate-covered strawberries were really good! All of this came to $175 plus gratuity. What??? Apparently, this hotel has one price for its food, and another price, approximately 25% to 45% higher depending, for the same food if delivered as room service (the filet mignon is $32 each on the regular restaurant menu but was charged to us at $45 each as part of room service). AND, they charge a $3 room service fee AND a 22% Room Service Gratuity. The food was good but ... Strike Two! I went and picked up the kids the next day and we spent the better part of the day at the River Ranch in the water. The pools, slide and lazy river are all a lot of fun. However, I did learn that the River Ranch is open to the general public, and that anyone who pays $15 each can get in. I guess there is a certain part of me that resents the fact that I just paid $179 per night for a casita and access to the River Ranch, yet someone can drive in off the streets and get into the waterpark for $15 and take all of the chairs and umbrellas. That evening, my wife and I went to the gift shop to get a deck of cards and a cup of coffee. You got it ... they don't serve coffee after 7:30pm. Went to check-out this morning. Noticed a charge of $157 from Slim Pickins, the food service at the pool. All we had at the pool was one drink, a daquiri, for $9.50. I questioned the charge, and was told that since the accounting departmenht wasn't in on Saturdays, there wasn't much that could be done. I had to demand that the charge be removed, which it eventually was. Strike Three! The casita itself was lovely. We had a two-bedroom, two-story casita. Downstairs was a living room, half-bathroom, dining room and small kitchenette with a 3/4 size fridge and microwave. There is no stove and no stovetop burners, so all cooking has to be done in the microwave. Upstairs are the two bedrooms, each with its own full bath, and a patio. Having a private parking space was nice. The grounds are well-kept and well-manicured. The River Ranch, however, is a mess. I saw empty beer bottles, plastic drink cups and food trays laying around for hours after people had finished them and left. \"Ranch Crew\", as the staff is called, is quick to get you something in hopes of a tip, but it seems nobody wants to clean-up after the messes. They call this place a resort, but in my book, there has to be a level of service and a certain expectation to be considered a resort, and this place just doesn't meet that expectation in my mind.

I haven't seen any pics posted of the interiors of these Casitas, so I'm going to post a bunch :) I know that the Hilton site says that the Casitas were upgraded recently, but they're pretty much laid out exactly as they were, just with upgraded surfaces. - The bed was far superior to its previous incarnation. Very nice upgrade. - The counter area of the bath area was very nice. - The amount of space for the toilet and the shower area could be increased. The door is still very close to the toilet and shower, not a lot of room to move. Overall the Casitas are very nice, they've even got the added convenience of being able to park in an attached garage slot. They're plenty roomy for people staying a long while with a full fridge and kitchenette area (but no stove and I don't remember a toaster oven) and plenty of closet space and drawer space for clothes. There's an upstairs full bath and downstairs 1/2 bath. The Casita 'neighborhoods' are probably a little quieter than the main building area. They're mostly located away from the main pool complex. It should be noted that you are not in a separate building, there are usually two other casitas attached. The grounds are quite pretty and well maintained, a short walk from the river ranch for breakfast (though pricey if you don't have a complimentary card). The only drawback to these units that I can see are the stairs leading up to the bedroom area. They're very steep, not handicap accessible by any means. If you have bad knees, you probably don't want to be lugging your baggage up these stairs. It should be noted that the bedroom area is not closed off to the rest of the casita by a door. You can look over the edge into the stair well going downstairs. This might create some noise issues if you're staying with others below who want to stay up all night watching TV :) I'm presuming, of course, that there is a pullout sofa bed downstairs. I think I read that there was....

The grounds are beautifully landscaped and lounge chairs in the main area around the lazy river, main pool, sport pool and water slide are plentiful with umbrellas and little places to tuck yourself away if you get there early to claim the spot you want. We had wonderful breakfasts each morning at the Hole in the Wall Grille. We recommend the Chorizo with scrambled eggs if you like spicy food at all. The American breakfast was also good especially if you have a big appetite. We were pleasantly surprised because we had read negative reviews about the food but we found it delicious. The service was friendly and accommodating. Tasty Indian Fry bread is included too-- each morning we ordered from the menu so we didn't try the buffet but other people commented that it was good as well. It's definitely a resort set up for families but it was relaxing for us to watch when we weren't floating in the lazy river which gently propels the inner tubes along an interesting route which includes an in-pool fountain. Bottom line-- we would go back. The only real negative was lack of internet service in our building AND our cell phones got no reception. More bars -- there were Not. We met other guests who like us had to go out into the parking lot to get any reception at all-- we laughed about it-- but it was annoying and for emergencies one would be out of luck.

It is a clean, family-friendly resort that is in a good location. I would go back or recommend this as a place to stay when traveling Arizona. Please read the following observations. Pool: Beautiful grounds. Nice space for a family. Lazy river was a good size and kids enjoyed water slide. Main pool was 2.5-3.5 ft in depth. Sports pool was 4 ft depth. Pool by room was 2-6 ft. Main pool was crowded at times; however, we were there during week before Easter. Pool temperature could have been warmer but kids still had good time. Room: Comfortable for family of 5, sitting room was nice with fold out bed. We have 3 active boys ages 12, 10, 7 and the sitting room helps a lot. Beds were comfy. Refrigerator was not working on arrival but we promptly received a replacement. Hotel restaurants: Pricey. We did not even attempt to eat here. Hotel is in an area where you can drive within a few miles and have McDonalds, Applebees, etc. We did see the concierge and went to local restaurants Oreganos and Diner 5 which were good family finds. There are plenty of other places to go that are convenient but recommend having a car. Actually, car is a must. Did not see any other places in Phoenix that I would not want a rental car. Activities: There is a mountain preserve that is visible and close to the hotel. Very nice easy hiking for family. We saw a rattlesnake and kids were thrilled. A hiking map is available from concierge. Went to Diamondbacks game and took stadium tour for cheap price. Boys loved it. Took a day trip to Grand Canyon (which I highly recommend). It was a long day (4 hours one way) but well worth it. Went gold panning at Goldfield Ghost Town. Kids did enjoy this and 7 year old said it was his favorite thing on trip. Apache Trail Tours guided the trip. Not sure that expense was \"worth it\"; although, kids loved it. Kids Club: Did not use. Misc: Size of hotel is not that bad. Smaller than a Disney World resort or all inclusive that we have been to in Mexico. We were in the furthest building but the walk to main pool was hardly anything to even consider. Even my directionally challenged husband could find everything. Enjoy the beauty of your surroundings.

This is a perfect way to end a hectic vacation schedule. Squaw Peak is a beautiful, classy resort, built for families. The grounds and rooms were pristine. Our room was very comfortable. Our kids (ages 6 and 9) loved it! We played mini golf and took advantage of the water park and smaller pools. Chairs at the water park filled up very quickly. They do have a policy of no saving chairs, but that policy was largely ignored. We paid $235 per night during spring break (taxes included), which was fair considering the quality of the resort and amenities. Mini golf, tennis, exercise room were all extra, but we discovered that if pay for one activity you were then able to add on other activities or services for a flat $2 fee (i.i. we paid for mini golf, but then were able to use the exercise room for a flat $2 for the remainder of our stay). NEGATIVE: Eating at this resort is very, very expensive. If you are spending the day at the water park, you are basically captive to the pool side offerings, especially if you want to hold your spot at the pool. Kid baskets (hot dog or hamburger, chips and beverage w/ one free refill) were reasonably priced at $6.25, but that certainly did not hold my kids for the entire day. Snow cones, snacks, and adult food and drink were very pricey. We splurged at the pool, but left the grounds for breakfast and dinner to limit spending.

Usually we go to Florida, but my kids had never been out West, so we thought this would be fun...and it was! The best thing about the resort are all the pools. The lazy river is even bigger than I expected ! There is something for all ages at the River Ranch pool area, which is good because my kids range from ages 4-14. Each building also has its own smaller pool too, and that's where we made lots of friends. The weather was beautiful and we ended up just hanging at the resort more than we'd planned. The place was packed with families....kids running EVERYWHERE. No big deal because 3 of them were mine. If I had come for a quiet week with my husband, I would have left. There is a very peaceful adult-only pool at the fitness center that I snuck over to once. The room was good, but not great. Funky smell at first, but I always bring candles. It also seemed dark to me, but maybe it was our location. Since we are a family of five, it was a little tight in the suite after a while. If we were to go back, I would definitely consider upgrading to a casita. There was a little fridge, but it didn't work very well and no microwave. THE BAD: The Hole in the Wall restaurant (yes, that is the real name). We ate there once for breakfast and once for dinner. Neither was good and it was VERY over-priced. The service was not good either. The Lantana Grille had much better food, but was even higher priced. Cocktails by the pool are $10 for a small cup and usually weak. Only once we got a good bartender. THE UGLY: We had toilet issues from the start...it wouldn't flush correctly. Plunger man had to be called a few times. Then we had a massive overflow that wouldn't stop. Our room was flooded in a few inches of water and it took a long time for anyone to come. When a guy did show up, he was not equipped to handle the job and had to call someone else. Finally, a guy came with a wet vac and a big fan. The carpet was still soaked though (squish, squish wherever we walked) and was never actually cleaned, nor was the bathroom tile. That's just gross! We were able to move to a new room after they finally realized how bad it was. I understand that these things happen, but an apology for our inconvenience would have been nice. Overall, we had a great time. We played putt-putt once and tennis once, but mostly hung out by the pools. The fitness room is nice...I should have spent more time there : ). The spa is okay. I had a massage that was a waste of $100. My daughter had a teen facial that she thoroughly enjoyed, so I guess it depends on who you get. If you like steam rooms, this one has major steam! The resort is not luxurious, but it's nice and a great place for a family vacation. The Old Spaghetti Factory downtown is not far and we had a great dinner there. We also loved Cowboy Ciao in Scottsdale~ trendy with unique and delicious food. Not so much for kids, but they were accomodating and made cheese quesadillas for us. We also went to Rawhide Western Town.

I always like to start with the negatives, of which there weren't many: 1) The main pool is not heated. Certainly not a big deal in the summer in Phoenix, but when we were there it was 55 when we woke up and 80 at midday. It would have been nice if the pool were heated. Note that the lazy river WAS heated and was fantastic during the cooler periods. 2) We blew the circuit breaker in our room 3 times in 7 days, without using any irons or hair dryers. Not sure what was up with that, but it was not a big deal. The first time, they sent someone immediately and they gave our child a \"token\" good for a prize. The next two times, we had seen where it was and just popped it ourselves. OK, now on to the positive - everything else!! 1) Most importantly, the people were great. Very friendly and helpful. 2) The kids had a blast (we went with my daughter & her cousin). They loved the pools, water slide, and miniature golf - all easily accessible & safe. They also loved the ice cream stand & the shaved ices & (virgin of course) pina colada slushes. 3) The kids camp. We always try them for a 1/2 day first. We have found some that are terrible and a few that are great. This fell into the \"great\" category. Not just somewhere to put the kids for a few hours while you do \"adult\" stuff - your kids will be begging to go back to this camp! They have a great \"camp\" facility with books, toys, puppet shows, crafts, lunch, and a short movie after lunch. They spend a lot fo the day outside, swimming (closely supervised), in the small playground, or doing activities like scavenger hunts (broken into small groups, each with a supervisor - who are all friendly & great with kids & range in age from college to say 55). One day, they went to one of the hotel reataurants and learned to make salsa - and brought home a nice sized container of what they made (which was delicious). 4) The restaurants. A tad overpriced and not fancy, but very good food and a great breakfast buffet. There are also a lot of good nearby restaurants (if you like spicy, try Los Dos Molinos - very casual, but great food & very hot). 5) The room. We had a Casita. All the rooms (if you figure out the shortcuts) are very close to the main pool / minigolf area. Most Casitas are also close to a small, more private pool. We tried that one day, but preferred the main pool as we enjoy seeing the activity & being close to food if we want it. (Oh yeah, the poolside grill is pretty good & has fast service). Our room was large and clean and comfortable. 6) The location - you are a few blocks from 51, which basically leads everywhere or connects easily to a road that does. You can be downtown in like 5-10 minutes. We REALLY enjoyed the Phoenix zoo - rated one of the top 5 zoos for kids. We were able to ride camels and pet sting rays and sharks (yes, really). They also have a walkthrough monkey village where there is no barrier between you and the monkeys. There is also a great sprinkler area with a \"water cave\" and small water slide where the kids can relax and cool off - best to bring some shorts to change into (we had some wet kids after that!). We also went on some horseback riding in the desert at a place recommended by the hotel - that was about a 30-minute drive, but worth it. We also went to some American Indian ruins.

(Stay tuned though...it got interesting later when we had to extend our stay another day...) \u00a0 We had king suites and they were very nice.\u00a0 There is a living room with a pull-out sofa, a vanity area with separate toilet/tub, and a bedroom with a king bed.\u00a0 Outside the bedroom is a small patio with two chairs and a small table.\u00a0 The layout was good, and there was plenty of room to move around.\u00a0 It would be a great place to bring kids as the parents could get some privacy with the separate areas.\u00a0 There are doors between the living room and vanity area, and another door between the vanity area and the bedroom.\u00a0 \u00a0 There is a mini-bar, but it was locked.\u00a0 I asked to have it opened and they brought a key right away.\u00a0 It is just a fridge, which is what I wanted it for anyway.\u00a0 Being away from home for a week, I needed a place to store food and beverages.\u00a0 I was quite disappointed that there was no microwave in the room.\u00a0 That limited my food choices a lot, especially since we were working long hours and I just wanted to eat a quick something and go to bed each night! They want you to spend money at their restaurants, I'm sure. \u00a0 Speaking of food...my colleague and I went to the Hole-in-the Wall grill the first night.\u00a0 It was decent food, but the prices are exorbitant here!\u00a0 It would have been cost-prohibitive for me to stay/eat here with my family of five.\u00a0 For example, the lowest cost entree on the menu was a $13 salad.\u00a0 This was not a fancy place folks...just a burger-salad-chicken-pizza type place for the family.\u00a0 Everything was expensive throughout the resort.\u00a0 You can walk to at least 3 good places to eat in 5 minutes or less...I suggest you do that.\u00a0 There is a sports bar called Ghallager's (didn't try it), an Italian place called Tutti Santi (mid-range price, good food and atmosphere) and a deli (don't know the name) all in the same place right there. We did the deli for lunch a couple times and they're open for breakfast too. The food at the deli was fairly priced and good. \u00a0 There is a Mickey D's just down the street right next to a grocery store.\u00a0 Also a gas station and a couple of banks nearby, as well as many other restaurants within a 5 minute drive.\u00a0 Do not pay to eat at the hotel.\u00a0 All of their food and drinks are way overpriced! \u00a0 Kids programming: they have a kids club where you can take them for supervised activities (kind of like on a cruise ship). The place is definitely kid-friendly! There were about a million of them there this week! Mostly little kids, but a few young teens also. Some people let their kids make noise outside in the corridors a bit late for my taste (as a business traveler). However, I do realize this is a resort and people were on vaycay, so not a big deal, I guess. Pools looked nice...didn't get to use them, but we were assured upon check-in that all pools are heated (which was laughable to us because we would not have the opportunity to use them with our grueling work schedule). The river ranch pool looked nice, and they have a lazy river. The pool in the center of the main hotel area also looked nice. I think there was a swim-up bar there and there is at least one hot tub. Parking was a bit hit and miss. When we were in building 2 (south) we had better luck with parking close to our rooms. The last night when we were in the north building, we couldn't find a decent spot. The place was full! Hugeness of it all: It is a huge hotel! You can get lost trying to find an ice machine! They do have signs to point you in the right direction though. No free internet: This annoys the heck out of me! We were at a smaller chain hotel the last time (a couple weeks ago) and they have free internet (wireless or with a cord), but the freaking Hilton makes you pay $12/day for internet (cord) in your room! This is yet another example of the nickel-and-diming going on at this place. Luckily work was paying, so I didn't have to fork over the cash. I guess they have wireless in the lobby if you want to use it. Broken coffee maker/no coffee: My in-room coffee maker began acting up on day 2 or 3. I left a note and they did replace it, but left no coffee! I had to call that night to have them bring me some coffee for the next morning. They are really fast when you call for something, I'll give them that. Service is fast. Everything else in the first room worked well. The rooms in building 2 are more updated than those in building one. For example, the bathroom in building one was smaller and had no exhaust fan. The rooms had the same basic layout, but the room in building 1 was a bit smaller. Pleasant decor and surroundings\u2014very nice views if you can ignore the parking lot. Lots of flowers and trees. Rooms are tastefully decorated. The courtyards in the interior part of the hotel were very nice, with fountains and vegetation. Everything was kept very clean, inside and out. They had super huge, thick bath towels. Much better than what I'm used to at the Hampton or other mid-range chains. Hot water was plentiful, but the water pressure could have been better. The bed was very nice and comfortable. Lots of pillows and very comfy. \u00a0 OK. So, we were at the hotel from Mon-Thur for work. Checked out Friday morning, but had to stay an extra day. We re-booked an extra night. This is where it got bad. We got off work late (a little before 9:00 pm, after a 14 hour day of work). Check in was efficient. However, now we had new rooms and they were in building 1, whereas we had been in building 2 the first few days. My room was on the third floor and as I walked toward it, I saw two women entering my room! I looked at the key, looked at the room number, and it was the right room. I knocked on the door and asked them if they were guests in this room (weird question, I'm sure), and they said yes. I told them the hotel had just given me a key to their room. They were very gracious and invited me in to use the phone to call the front desk to let them know they f*^#-ed up. Turns out, they transposed the last two numbers. They told me which room to go to (really far away) and sent up a bellman with the right key. At this point I was really angry. I told the guy this was unacceptable and did not tip him. Felt bad about that later...wasn't his fault. But, can you imagine if I had walked into a room that was occupied with sleeping children on the sofa bed, or a couple on their honeymoon, or whatever? New towels\u2014not to whine, but the next morning the huge fluffy white towels were brand new. That is good, except you need to wash new towels before using them! I had little white fuzzies all over me after using them! Another positive was the good security on golf carts all the time. I never felt unsafe here. Well, some of the corridors were dark at night.

I live in Phoenix and have stayed at both the Point Hilton Squaw Peak and Tapatio Cliffs Resorts more than 30 times over the past couple of years. I usually stay for a few days to get away or when friends and family visit I suggest they stay at either property and I get a room as well. I am actually bummed that I have to write this review as I have had many great experiences at this property, however be it cut backs due to the economy or just terrible customer service I will not be back. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. As a Hilton Honors member I had the worst experience I have ever had at a property in my life. I have a friend in town with his wife and 2 kids and another couple both are staying at Tapatio Cliffs and took the shuttle over to Squaw Peak. We tried to make reservations at the 2 hotel restaurants, however both said they were booked and they suggested Aunt Chiladas which is off property about 1/2 mile away. They said they had a shuttle that would take us there and back. We had 7pm reservations and they brought us over in golf carts, which the kids enjoyed, and the driver was very nice and I gave him a good tip. We were informed just to call the hotel or the restaurant would call for us to request the return shuttle. We asked for the shuttle via the restaurant and after 15 mins were informed the hotel was not answering the phones. I too tried calling, however no answer and I tried calling more than 5 times. So here we are, 9:30pm and the 2 kids are sleeping (long day, arrived on a 7am flight) and no shuttle. We decided to walk back after another 40 mins of calling and waiting. Not sure if you ever carried a ten year old and a 8 year old for over \u00bd mile in the dark after a long day, however its not fun. We get back to my room and called the front desk, no answer, bell desk no answer, we tried every extension and there was no answer? What the f%$? Where are these people? This is supposed to be a full service resort. Now my friends are already frustrated because we had to walk back, but now they have no ride back to the Tapatio Cliffs Resort. I called the front desk AGAIN and the manager on duty was useless. I finally talked to a bellman (10:30pm) and he tells us the shuttle doesn\u2019t run this late and is not guaranteed and we should have called earlier. Are you kidding me? We started calling at 9pm\u2026\u2026..So I had to call them a cab. We talked to an operator who basically could care less about our situation and was completely rude. She hung up on me because I asked her why an entire hotel staff was not answering the phone. I called back and told her what I thought about her and hanging up on me. During this fiasco I lost my cell phone, probably while carrying a ten year old on my back. I called the operator to get the number to the restaurant to see if they had my phone and she would not connect me, her quote and I swear this is 100% true was \u201cI am never going to let you talk to the restaurant\u201d and chuckled and then hung up on me. Are you freakin serious? I then tried calling the front desk and operator and AGAIN no answer. Anyway, I talked to the hotel Manager today and guess what he was? Useless. He said he read the report of what happened and the hotel operator said I was rude to her? Hmmmmmm, lets see. For $269 per night this is what you get. ZERO support A staff who does not answer the phone Stranded in the middle of the night Pay for cab fair Rude people Sorry if I was a little rude, how about you do YOUR JOBS and do what you say you are going to do, not leave guests stranded and I won\u2019t be rude. Anyway, I get up this morning and decide to go take a swim and sit in the hot tub. The pool area is a mess with beer bottles, cups, dirty towels everywhere. I am thinking what the hell has happened to this place, its like I checked into a Motel 6. I turn on the hot tub and no bubbles???? A worker walks by and says oh that\u2019s still broken? Still broken? How long has it been broken? Oh about a week. Then I decide to at least just soak in the hot tub, I grab the hand rail and it pops out of the hole and I almost fall. Enough is enough, I am going home\u2026. Anyway, do yourself a favor and stay away from this property, there are several others in the Phoenix area that are much nicer and have a staff that values customer service.

You can get anywhere within Phoenix quick. We went to Phoenix for a long weekend mainly to see the Indians in spring training, and to take my neices to the Grand Canyon for the day. We rented a 2-bedroom casita at the Squaw Peak - which wasn't cheap by any means, but I had stayed there 9 years ago, and remember the pools and thought they'd have a great time. We were disappointed by two things right off the bat - one that we only received a select number of passes (6 for a casita) and that the River Ranch was only open limited hours, 10-6, or at least that's what we were told by the front desk. We later found out it was really 9-7, but that's still very limited and wish we would have known that as we probably would have just stayed some place else with a regular heated pool and a regular room. I do have to say the landscaping is absolutely beautiful. From someone how loves flowers - I was blown away by the color and beauty. Outstanding. The casita was beautiful, plenty of room and well furnished. The 2nd bedroom was laid out strange, but it worked. It was nice to have the pools around the casita area, but by no means were they \"heated\" as they claimed they were. Our shower head was horrible, no water pressure and spit water at us instead of streaming. And the TV would blare sound when first turned out - scrared you to death every time it was turned on! We tried the River Ranch for only one day we were there as the other day was consumed by our day trip to the Canyon. The girls had fun at the Ranch, my husband and I played the mini golf, which I don't think you should have to pay extra to play. We already paid a fortune to stay there - they could throw in a round of mini golf. The mini golf course was poorly designed and confusing to say the least. Not much fun, but it passed the time I guess. Dinner at the Latina Grille was expensive and medicore. Although, there were coupons in the room we later found to help with the costs but we didn't go back. Just eat elsewhere - there are so many places in Phoenix to eat - but a car is essential. Overall we probably would only come back if we had a lot of time to spend lounging around and with kids.

After reading some of the more recent reviews, I almost canceled our reservation, but it was hard to beat my company's Hilton contract rate here. I figured if it was *that bad*, we would just switch somewhere else after one night. I have Hilton Gold status and they upgraded us to a Casita. A bellman escorted us to the room and helped carry our bags in. The Casita was nice enough though the look is rather dated. There is a stained-glass window over the staircase to the second floor, and no way to block the light coming in through this window. The bed was comfortable and the main bath was nice enough. Some have mentioned having poor cell phone coverage... there was only one place in the room where we didn't have a signal, overall that wasn't an issue. We were given free continental breakfast coupons and had breakfast one day at the Hole-in-the-Wall. As other reviews have mentioned, the food there was terrible and we didn't go back. Also the cell phone didn't really work in the restaurant. It was a little too chilly to enjoy the lazy river, though the water was warm and there were a few kids floating around. The whole resort had a rather empty feel during our stay, though the casitas seemed to be mostly occupied. The staff in the convenience store were really nice as well as at \"Rodeo Drive\", and the concierge helped us decide where to go hiking one morning. We also liked that the small pools are open until 11 PM, and while they have a plethora of clean towels in the pool area, we couldn't figure out where to put the wet ones. We had a security issue where the back door to the casita (at the carport) wasn't closing properly. Even if it was closed, I could push it open! We called maintenance and they fixed it while we were out one day. While the door was indeed fixed, they left the other door to the unit slightly ajar when they left! We could have had stuff stolen out of the room. Thankfully nothing was, but it was beyond careless that they left the other door open upon completion (we are sure that we did not leave it open - it was obvious that maintenance was using that door while they were repairing the other one). When we called about this, they sent maintenance over rather than security...security eventually called. We found out too late that with Hilton Gold status we would have been able to use the gym for free -- the published day rate was $12. It looked like a nice gym.

I joined him for the last 5 nights before we headed off touring. Despite having a high level Hilton Honors priviledge card, he got a very ordinary room, surprisingly small compared to say the average high end motel room, and was told nothing else was available, when he checked in. They gave him a few complimentary vouchers for the cheapest breakfast available on site, instead. When he got to the room, it had yet to be serviced. Two days later, he returned to his room mid morning to get some papers he had left inside by accident. The keycard would not work. He ran to reception where it was reissued. It still didn't work. Long story, short - 5 maintenance staff members and 45 minutes later, he got access to the room. Of course, by now, he was extremely late for a meeting where he had to make a presentation. They gave him a $20 voucher for his inconvenience!!!!! The room was very tired - furniture scuffed and old fashioned, drapes faded, paintwork scratched, bathroom fixtures scoured until the base metal was exposed, that kind of thing. The desk was too small to do any work on and use a PC at the same time, it had an old-fashioned TV with a poor screen. Worse, the airconditioning was extremely noisy and the thermostat very insensitive. It turns itself off for long periods, then the fan comes on at maximum warp to cool the room down in a hurry, then runs a little more quietly before shutting off. This cycle is not conducive to a peaceful night's sleep. My first day, arriving jet-lagged from the UK, they had a water problem. I ended up having a cold shower in the morning, but there was NO water by 10.00 am. Guests were told they could use the facilities in the spa building, 5 minutes walk away. While the water was off, housekeeping 'did' the room. How you can clean a bathroom properly and hygienically without water, nobody ever managed to explain to my satisfaction. Further, there was evidence of remedial repair works going on around the accommodation blocks, and the nearest elevator to the room was out of order for the whole of my husband's 12 night stay. This hotel has a large pool and water activity based leisure facility. This is ideal for families with children and people wanting to relax and sunbathe. If you spend most of your time here, you will probably consider the property not bad. If you mostly just use the rooms, you are unlikely to be impressed. The best feature, to me, was a reasonably comfortable bed. While the front of house staff were polite and embarrassed at the shortcomings, and claimed they wanted to help with the problems we encountered, they didn't actually achieve much or offer anything positive or genuinely meaningful to alieviate the situation.

Anyway, to be objective: Check in- was swift, but failed to identify or provide the appropriate vouchers for breakfast (identified as an issue on many reviews), and gave out of date \"value\" pack, which was worthless Room- no different from 5 years ago, although in the main block this time; Dusting is obviously a long forgotten art here, as is recognition of Diamond HH status- no benefit at all at this hotel River ranch- facilities good, but maintenance and consistency (water butts/cups etc,) hit and miss; Slim Pickens bar- \"you need it more than me budd!\" when leaving only $1 after having walked the length of the park, had a single beer poured and charged \u00a35.50 for it! I Dont get the tipping thing when the guy/gal has done F all for it!! Breakfast- eventually having managed to get our entitled vouchers, we began to regret it! Food at the Lantana is a complete lucky dip, which fits perfectly with the service! Dont even worry about the time, just dont think about what is going to turn up- you order white toast, guaranteed its brown; scrambled eggs and bacon appeared as poached and sausages! One day, not even given a plate- \"I thought I'd just put yours on your husbands!\" Another day, seated at a table with no waiter at all taking responsibility for it! Had to coerce a guy to help us to get served! Lunch- DONT GO to the Hole in the Wall! Food crap, overpriced and thats even before they try to rook you later by adding 50%, which takes days to fight! keep your receipts! Seems that the Cowboys are still around, now just outlaws! Dinner- didnt take the chance- too risky! Positives: The weather is great, the pools are well maintained, and most of the staff are friendly, if not necessarily professional. Housekeeping staff are patient and thorough, except for dusting! and the Tocasierra gym was excellent, with helpful staff and good facilities. Cabs- obviously the hotel has a kick back from the cab company they use- its impossible to get a sedan, always an SUV at 10% more, but also more thn the cabs from the Ritz (from Hilton to Biltmore- $25, from Ritz at Biltmore to Hilton- $18!! Dont bother booking- 5 years ago, booked, failed to turn up; Same this time! Recomendations- Shop at Basha and enjoy balcony snacks, supported by happy hour snacks from Lantina grill; Go to Elements at the Sanctuary for a good meal- a little pricey but the service and quality dwarf anything near Squaw Peak . Manager of Lantina- have buffet guests in one area- they need little assistance other than drinks top ups, and have continental breakfast set up so that one person can supervise (if you are that untrusting), but for goodness sake, make sure that people are served within 30 minutes of seating and get the order right!! Or employ people that like their work! Sounds like a harsh review! Would we come back- probably not due to the complete lack of understandng of customer service and value, but maybe, because there were a few that made it worthwhile- Felipe, the gardener at the top pool, Sam at front desk, and Patti our housekeeper, the gym staff, and some others whose names we didnt catch- the manager at the water ranch, the guy who checked us in, and our waitress on our first and last days.

We choose this resort as we were traveling with our daughter, son-in-law and small granddaughter and by the reviews written by others, this property seemed to be a good choice for kids. The property has recently been renovated and I enjoyed the warm colors of the resort's exteriors as well as the suite's colors & furniture. We had adjoining rooms; our's with a king bed and the other with 2 queens. After reading someone else's review I also requested suites in the South building (where the main lobby is) and this turned out to be great as the bedrooms didn't have the hot afternoon sun, but rather nice shady balconies. Our suites were just a short walk across the parking lot to the River Ranch. The beds were extremely comfortable..great Serta perfect sleeper mattresses, comfy pillows and soft sheets. The bathrooms were sparkling clean and nice idea to put the shower and toilet in one room and separate dressing room. The bath towels were very good quality, new and fluffy. The swimming pool area (by our suites & main lobby) was nice, with very comfortable lounge chair cushions. One complaint would be that the towels here & at River Ranch could use upgrading as they were really thin, small and not of the quality they should be for a Hilton resort and compared to the quality of the bath towels in the suites. The River Ranch was great. Plenty of lounge chairs throughout the area. The lazy river was fun and again plenty of tubes available. We rented a locker to store our personal items although we felt like the area was pretty safe when leaving sandals & coverups, etc. on the lounge chairs.Bring your own lock if you have one for the locker but we were able to purchase one for $5. The one area of the resort that did not meet our expectations were the on-site restaurants. We were warned of this on other's reviews but did try 3 restaurants for ourselves and were also disappointed. While the Slim Pickens grill in River Ranch makes excellent smoothies, they didn't seem to care at all that they never processed the burger part of the order. In fact the young man there was rather flip about his error when my husband asked for our money back. We also tried the Hole in the Wall restaurant for lunch. We were one of only 2 tables in the restaurant and the meal took which we considered borderline too long considering the order consisted of one sandwhich & fish and chips (Friday Fish Fry special). It was just ok. The waitress never came by the table to let us know of the meal's progress. There were several servers all walking around and talking to each other but it would have been nice to have gotten some attention ourselves. The biggest disappointment was the Lantana Grille for Saturday buffet breakfast. Our server took much too long to come to our table after we were seated, finally brought us OJ, but never stopped by again to ask us for a re-fill or anything else for that matter. The buffet was sub-par, with pastries that looked like they were packaged grocery store type, bagels were never replentished, lox never had tongs on plate, chaffing dishes were either empty or almost empty of hot items most of the time, eggs were over-cooked and dry. The cook in the special order (waffles, omelettes,etc.) area was incompetent....couldn't keep orders straight. Definitely needed help. What was amazing is that there didn't seem to be anyone overseeing the buffet at all. $16.95 per person for very poor quality buffet. Don't waste your money here! We found the staff around the whole resort very friendly. We had a little problem with something sticking out of the floor door frame in the area between our suites that cut my son-in-laws foot. I called housekeeping and someone showed up at our door within 5 minutes to fix the problem, so we were impressed with that. There is free Wi-Fi in the lobby area but if you want it in your room, it's $11.95 for 24 hours. It would be nice if this was complimentary but this is the way it still is in many hotels.

We only live a mile from the property but our kids love the water park, and we love the suite sized rooms (400SF) with seperate bedroom and living area. You cannot beat the location if considering staying in the Phoenix area. This is close to downtown (5mi), Scottsdale Fashion Square (5mi), Biltmore Fashion Plaza (3mi), great hiking (Squaw Peak - 1mi, Camelback mountain - 2mi), and freeway (1mi). Seems there has been some remodelling in the rooms since our last stay, as rough texture on walls has been smoothed out (popcorn ceilings still present though). Also added shade coverings on the balconies, which really helps with the intense afternoon sun. We always stay in Pointe South (this is a big property with suites and cabanas, Pointe South is where the main lobby is, there is also Pointe North with a seperate pool) in a non-smoking suite, next to the pool, room 2362. This is a king bedroom, with queen sofa bed. We were really pleased with the room, as normally always get 2 queen beds (rooms are a little bigger). Room on the East side (less intense afternoon sun). Furnishings look new, and very comfortable. TVs both worked, and bed was very comfortable with nice soft sheets and pillows. My wife is allergic to down/feathers, and was no problem having comforter and pillows changed. We also checked in at 12pm (4pm normal checkin) and checked out at 1pm 2 days later, with no questions or hassles or extra fees. We spent a lot of time at the lazy river and water slide. My wife preferred to hang out in the room, and relax. We did not check out the gym, although usage was included in package. There is an 18hole mini-golf which I played with my daughter. Also 4 tennis courts (no idea of pricing). Internet access is $12.00/day (in-room) but have free wi-fi in the lobby (which seemed to work in the patio area that liked to sit in. We ate at the \"Hole in the Wall\", mainly burgers, steaks and chicken. Sat on the patio first night, and was disappointed with number of flies. Food was okay (kids eat free a good deal), service was a bit slow, I seem to remember the same problem the previous year. This was a holiday weekend, but restaurant did not appear overly crowded, and not sure why it took 20 minutes from placing order to getting burger and fries. Made use of the buffet ($6.00/kids under 12) at lunch. Never ate at the Lantana grill, bit outside our price range. There are a number of good restaurants within 2 miles. - Golden Dragon - very good Chinese, Northern/12th St (1mi) - TexAZ grill - excellent BBQ, 16th St/Bethany Home (2mi). - Sauce - modern Italian eatery - pizza/salad, Glendale/7th St - PeiWei - Asian food (PF Chang subsidiary), Glendale/7th St - Moto - Japanese, Glendale 16th St. - Aunt Chilada's - Mexican, soft chips (opposite hotel) - Carlos Obrians - popular Mexican food 12th St/Northern - Paradise Bakery - 12th St/Glendale (good bread, sandwiches) Fast food: - MacDonalds - 16th St/Glendale (0.5mi) - Subway - 16th St/Glendale (0.5mi) - NY Pizza - 12th St/Northern (0.5mi) - Stumpey's Pizza - 12th St/Glendale (deliver) - Papa Johns - 16th St/Glendale (deliver) - Pizza Hut - 16th St/Bethany Home (deliver) - Starbucks - 16th St/Bethany Home Grocery: - Bashas - 16th St/Glendale - Safeways - 7th St/Glendale There were a lot of people at the property but never felt too crowded, and swimming pools were kept very clean. I was a little suprised at how relaxed everyone was with the rules (lazy river and water slide). Maybe it is the end of the season, but in previous years were very strict on height for water slide and making sure used a tube on the lazy river. Hiking at Squaw Peak, 2mi to parking, 1.25mi 1000ft climb. Very popular hike, good parking. Get there early on weekends. Can also hike at Dreamy Draw Park which is on the North side of Squaw Peak, lots of trails, and easy 1mi drive from hotel. Camelback mountain, 3mi to parking. 1.25mi 1200ft climb. Two routes, East and West. Recommend West route, but limited parking at Echo Canyon, more parking 0.6mi away. Get there early on weekends. North Mountain. More gentle, can even take the paved road to the top. 7th St/Peoria, near Pointe Tapiteo (2mi). Cons: I got home and checked my bank account, and see a $360.00 deduction pending from my account from Hilton hotels (Hilton manage the Pointe hotels - there are three Pointe South Mountain, Pointe Tapiteo, and Pointe Squaw Peak). I knew my bill was only $283.00. I call and am politely told they put a hold on the hotel rate plus $50.00/day for incidentals, and should be credited back within 72hours of departure.

We never ate there for dinner, so I can't comment on the quality. Spa and health club - I am a runner but didn't do any exercise on this trip (unless you count downing margerita's).

I had spent a lot of time researching various hotels in the Phoenix area and settled on the Squaw Peak because it appeared to be quite \"kid friendly\" from what we read, including the reviews on TripAdvisor. Our kids, aged 8,10 and 14 had a great time. The lazy river and pools were a big hit, especially with our younger kids. The check in process went smoothly (we booked through United Vacation.com and got a great deal on the lodging as well as the flight from Denver) and we were given one of the standard rooms with a bedroom with 2 queens and a separate living area with a foldout sofa. When we checked in we were told to check back in a couple days about a possible upgrade. I did check back, and we did receive a room upgrade on about our third day at the resort. The upgraded room was a two story casita, with plenty of room for our family of five to spread out. Much nicer than the standard room. We stayed a total of 9 nights at the resort and truly enjoyed it. We had been concerned that the heat would be unbearable but as it was Phoenix was blessed with a few days of relatively cooler weather in late May before it started to warm up, gradually. Didn't really matter to us as we spent a lot of time around the pools. The breakfasts at Lantana Grille and the Hole in the Wall at the River Ranch were pretty good. We tended to go off-resort for other meals - there are some decent places to eat quite close to the resort. We did do dinner at the Hole in the Wall one evening but the service was terrible - in fact my wife and kids got tired of waiting for the food and left - we ended up eating it in our room. I used the fitness facilities at the Tocasierra Fintness Center a number of times and found it satisfactory, with plenty of equipment - although a couple of the treadmills were not very stable. My wife and eldest daughter also indulged with spa treatments, and although somewhat pricey, they did find them enjoyable. The River Ranch was the big hit of our vacation, and there was never a problem finding lounge chairs, towels, etc. - although getting service at your lounge chair on the weekend days can be a bit frustrating due to the volume of people. We also took the free shuttle over to the Tapatio Cliffs resort on a couple occassions. The main pool area at that resort is also quite nice, and I found the bar area actually a little livlier. The fact that we could use the facilities of both resorts is a real plus in my mind. I travel quite a bit both domestically and internationally, and while the Squaw Peak is a nice place, with decent amenities and mostly very good service, I would not rate it a premier resort.

The restaurant was just understaffed. Our waiter did the best he could. He was just over worked... 6. Lots of local high schoolers invading the pool complex. 7. NO WiFi in the rooms!! Come on!!!

We particularly liked the spacious private casita. We had a pool and hot tub right outside our door and it was never busy. We managed to squeeze in one afternoon floating down the Lazy River and going down the water slide. Great fun in the very hot sun! Ate one night in the hotel's Lantana Grille and it was okay. Another night we wandered down the street about 2 blocks and stumbled on the best Italian food in a restaurant called Tutti Santi. From the outside it doesn't look like much, but inside is great and we had a really fun evening there. Because the hotel is close to the freeway, it was easy to dine in other areas and we had a fabulous dinner at Roy's in Scottsdale. At this hotel we liked the spacious rooms which included a kitchen and we like the proximity to the freewy. At Tapatio Cliffs we liked the scenery, the layout of the resort in the cliffs, and the more adult-oriented facilities including the great bar by the big pool. The rooms at Tapatio Cliffs were smaller than casitas but they were very nice and we liked being able to keep our sliding door open all night.

Also out of all the hot tubs NONE were working, some had no lights around them working, the bubbles did not work and some were also cold. the tiles were chipped and hanging off. which meant sharp edges Our chill out time to sit in one with a glass of wine when the kids were in bed..did not happen. when we tried to compain we were told that it would be rectified but in the mean time we were told to walk from our room accross a very large dark car park through the lobby and try the one there!! The lights did not work!! nor did the bubbles. They did manage to heat one but that was all, no lights and when we put the bubbles on it emptied the hot tub.

SO we parked on the street. This was fine. So let me get to the horrible part. When we were ready for bed, at about 10pm, we heard very very loud rap music apparently coming from the room below us. I called the front desk once and they called the other room and the music stopped. OKAY fine, right ? NO WAY. At about 12am we were awoken to very very loud music and a bunch of kids screeming \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY\". I called front desk, they sent out security and the music stopped. ABout 20 min later, the music started again. AND SERIOUSLy, it seemed like our walls were paper thin. We could hear these kids cussing and yelling and we even smelled pot. I was SO furious by this point, its 2am now, I called front desk and asked for another room. THEY REFUSED and said they would call security again. Security did nothing but made all the kids leave the room. SO now the kids are standing outside our window cursing and breaking bottles. WAS this the HILTON OR WHAT?? I called the front desk yet again and demand a new room or to call the police. They still did NOTHING. Let me tell you I was even afraid to go outside to check on my car. Well, I called and got the managers name, obviously an inexperienced kid, and in the morning when I spoke to the manager, he again did nothing. OH wait, he took $20 off our BILL> I WAS SO FURIOUS!!

I found the hotel to be a great value at around $65.00 per night. The lodging consists of two four story towers designated as north and south, and a large number of two story \"casitas\". My accomodations consisted of a two room suite in the south tower. It appears the two tower buildings are at least 30 years old and are in need of some cosmetic touch ups on the exterior. Signs of aging are apparent on parts of the stucco and tile roofing. However, the fourth floor suite I was assigned had been recently updated and was quite acceptable for the price. The bed was fantastic, very comfortable, and although the bedroom and bathroom was small, it was cozy and the balcony afforded a nice view of the nearby mountains. (Keep in mind all suites do not offer a view of the mountains). I ate three times at the \"Hole in the Wall\", and found it to be great. The food was excellent and priced reasonably for a Hilton. This is not your fancy food, but offerings such as Country fried steak for dinner ($13.50), and barbeque brisket sandwich at lunch ($9.25), were delicious and the portions were huge. My server, \"Belle Starr\", offered exceptional service, was extremely friendly and remembered my name each time I dined there. She was typical of the great service I encountered at the hotel. The true centerpiece of this resort is not the accomodations or the restaurants, but the huge water park located on site. It is sprawling and very impressive and would be a dream come true for kids of all ages. Even in December, when the daytime temperatures were in the 50's, I saw kids in the water. Another plus is the close proximity of the Hilton Squaw Peak to the Phoenix Mountain Preserve, a quick 3 mile drive to the east. The preserve offers ample opportunity for hiking and getting close to nature and the hike to the top of squaw peak offers breathtaking views of the valley below.

My girlfriend and I stayed in this fine resort for 4 days in early Oct. We found most of the reviews to be very true and accurate. Rather than sharing useless details about our stay, I will instead provide you with suggestions on how you can enjoy your stay to the fullest!. Hopefully these suggestions will make your trip as successful as ours. #1 - Request a remodeled room upon making your reservation. The remodeled rooms contain new everything! Our room was AWESOME! We checked out some rooms that had not yet been remodeled, at the same price, and were so thankful that we had made this request (thanks to other reviews on tripadvisor.com). #2 - Request a fridge upon checking in. This cost us nothing and proved so nice to have. #3 - Take advantage of the free shuttle system. Upon request, the bell desk granted us free shuttles to the Fashion mall and the Squaw Peak Summit. They were EXTREMELY courteous and very informative. Assuming you are at all adventurous and enjoy the outdoors, I cannot say enough good things about the Squaw Peak Summit climb. 1.5 miles, 1200 feet up, and so very very beautiful! The other climbers are VERY friendly and the view is to die for. Be sure to bring your camera and plenty of water! #4 - Eat at Hole In The Wall! The food is fantastic, VERY reasonable, and the service is professional and timely. We ate there each day. Dominic was our waiter and VERY friendly! #5 - Take advantage of the concierge. We knew very little about the area that we were in along with the attractions that were nearby. They are VERY helpful and will provide you with an array of attractions, availability, prices, recommendations, etc. #6 - Lastly - plan on making a trip to the Walgreens or any local grocery store on the first day. The water in the room is a complete rip off ($6 a bottle) and the drinks at the pool ($9 for a weak mixed drink) were about the only negatives that we could come up with. After the first day we stocked up on water and bought some liquor at the grocery store in order to make this trip more affordable and enjoyable.

Resort located in midst of city, surrounded by heavy traffic roads, etc, though we could not hear any road noise due to the landscaping and how the rooms faced inward to a pool area. Room had a separate two queen bed bedroom, TV, bureau, credenza and closet - no security safe though. Odd shape of room led to the use of a pocket door instead of a regular door, plus one bed partially blocked the door exit. Otherwise, the bedroom was fine. \"Patio\" which was a sliding door off the bedroom looked out into the pool and the neighboring hallway.

Hotel pools were well maintained, plenty of towels, chairs, cleaned pool, kiddie pool, whirlpool, chilled water cooler/cups. Water park was typical - lazy river, sports pool - volleyball, regular pool with water falls. Too busy for our needs, so we visited only once to see what was offered. Adjacent grill provided food.

Although lacking the initial wow factor that I expected, I thought that The Hilton provided amazing service. The concierge was friendly and extremely helpful, our room was always clean, the pool attendants were very welcoming, and room service was quick and delicious. With any hotel, there were a few things that I wished were a bit different. The sitting room was dark, even with all three lamps on, the air conditioning was a little loud and the sink/mirror were separate from the shower/toilet. The light switch to the bathroom was located outside of the bathroom door. So, for those of you traveling with practical jokers, they will have a great time at your expense! Nothing earth shattering, just food for thought. Now, back to the fun stuff...the hotel offers many different pools to accomodate people of all ages, and they even had a movie night! Our courtyard pool closed earlier than posted, so you may want to check the hours. The hotel is conveniently located for sight seeing. Take time to drive around and look at the mountains, they are gorgeous! Scottsdale/Phoenix has wonderful restaurants . NY pizza delivers to the hotel and was fast and delicious, Charlestons and Black Angus are casual but very nice, and have wonderful food and excellent service. Bahama Breeze has good food in a fun environment, and also had outstanding service. Kierland Commons and Desert Ridge shopping centers offer fun shopping, and are nice areas even if you are only window shopping. Plenty of antique shops and golfing opportunities abound. Antique shoppers traveling with families beware: there is one town in particular that is well known for it's antique shops. They have a beautiful brochure, which is extremely misleading. Once you see the gang graffiti, turn around, it does not get much better. It is obvious that the town is trying to clean things up, because the actual downtown area is being renovated and looks quite lovely. The surrounding area...not so lovely, and it isn't worth the risk. Although I feel a little guilty for indirectly ratting them out, I feel a deeper loyalty to innocent families who may get into harms way. Don't miss the Desert Botanical Garden, which is beautiful and very peaceful. There are also plenty of little squirrels and quail to amuse everyone. Crackerjax offers miniature golfing, go-carts and an arcade. Although not entirely perfect, the Hilton offers a comfortable environment for the whole family, and near-perfect service.

Towels were not picked up and food and beverage containers were still everywhere from the night before. About Wednesday, things changed and the pool area was spotless. Possibly the person in charge of the pool was on vacation at the beginning of the week. Another problem with the pool was a private company giving swimming lessons to small children. After a day of being in conferences, it would have been nice to just get into the pool, but that wasn't always possible. Last, there are no pool rules posted and children were throwing balls, diving into the pool (there was a no diving sign), and many just being obnoxious. No real parenting going on there.

We wanted a \"fun\" place to take him and this looked like it was it. After booking, I became concerned after reading some of the TripAdvisor reviews. Having stayed in a number of Hilton properties, I can tell you that if you have children, this is the place to go. The River Ranch has multiple pools, a long lazy river for use with pool-supplied inner tubes, a water slide, and a kiddie pool. Neat waterfall for kids and adults to play in. There is also a hot tub at the River Ranch. Food at the River Ranch outdoor bar is the same price as any pool resort-a little pricey, but not outrageuos. But there are plenty of \"water stations\" at the pool with large containers of free cold water and plenty of cups along side. The only aspect that bothered me is that through the week, it closed at 8 pm. I thought that too early-especially with the temp hitting 112 degrees... The Hole in the Wall restaurant at the River Ranch was good and the prices were very reasonable. We did not play the miniature golf only because it was too hot, but it looked fun. We stayed in a regular suite with 2 queen beds, and it was fine. Very comfortable bed. No, you could not put personal items in the fridge, but we bought a styro cooler down the street at Walgreens and kept it filled with ice from the ice machines located on every floor. If you are eating outside the resort, you will need a car. You can walk to Aunt Chiladas (good Mexican food-neat atmosphere- very reasonable prices-good margaritas -you can purchase your own shaker to take home!) Other than that, you will need to drive. Good choices are Claim Jumper (good prices- kid friendly-neat menu choices-to die for 6 layer chocolate cake..it is a 10 dollar dessert, but feeds a host of people!) Another fun place to take kids is the 5 & Diner. (Juke box at every table, milk shakes served in the stainless shakers-terrific food real really reasonably priced..) Pizza was good and inexpensive at Streets of New York. We were only there for 4 days, so we did not go on any tours or day trips. But our grandson enjoyed the pools so much that it did not matter to us that we did not go anywhere else. After the pool closed at 8 pm, he could swim in our south-end pool complex. I thought the water was cloudy in the hotel complex pool, but he enjoyed it anyway. I was looking forward to using the hotel complex hot tub after the River Ranch closed, but the first night, it was ice cold! It was warm the remaining nights, though... We did check out the Hilton Tapatio Resort also in Phoenix. Again, if you have kids or are an adult that likes water play, stick to Squaw Peak! I did think the pricing for the Squaw Peak kids \"Coyote Camp\" was too high. But since our grandson was perfectly happy making friends in the River Ranch water area, we did not use the Camp. The River Ranch is open later on Fri and Sat nights-they show an outdoor kids movie on Sat nights. The kids can swim and watch a movie at the same time-that was kinda cool... It did bother me that there were no safes in the rooms-that needs attention!! And a 10 dollar a day charge for internet service was ridiculous-I would not and did not pay for that-even thought I took my wireless laptop with me. Sorry, but that should be free!!! The staff was friendly and they all took a few moments and chatted with our grandson whenever he wanted to show them his latest purchase from a gift shop or needed scotch tape or glue for something he was working on..(Much appreciated, staff!) And the lady at the 3rd floor kids concierge played a board game with him one hot afternoon-thanks! And the hotel concierge in the lobby really knew the area and what to recommend. He printed a map for us one night when we asked directions for an eatery. And they will print your boarding passes for you the day before you leave-that was a great help to us! I do think they need more handicapped parking. My husband requires handicapped parking, and it was always hard to find one available-especially during the weekend. But all in all, we had a really fun time just swimming, exploring the resort complex, trying out new restaurants-just spending some quality family time together. It was very relaxing and my grandson is ready to go again next year.

I've indicated \"Pro and Cons\" below: Pro: 1) Great pool(s)! - The North & South buildings all had their own pools, with hot tubs & bars. The River Ranch was huge, with multiple tiered pools. The \"River\", although slow, was very nice and pretty long. You basically ride a large inner-tube. The pool area is great for families with kids. 2) General service - I thought the service was great, very helpful. 3) Nice rooms - The rooms were nice, not very upscaled. We stayed in the regular 1-bedroom suites, so I can't speak about the bigger units or Casitas. 4) Easy check in/out. Be aware of the 4pm check-in though. 5) Room service (meals) were good. Cons: 1) Construction work on our floor....changing out locks. Not too much of an inconvenience, but a bit of a hassle getting new keys. The resort is starting to show alittle wear & tear, hence the need for constant \"fixes\". 2) Maid service had to be reminded to make-up rooms. 3) The resort is a bit expensive for a Hilton, but many discounts (i.e. AAA, Entertainment) exist. 4) This is a great family resort, however, given that my group had no kids tagging along, we got alittle tired of all little ones running around. If that's a problem, go elsewhere. Things to do: 1) Sedona was a great day trip. I'll certainly make another trip there someday. 2) Golfing - we played at the Sanctuary and the Arizona Biltmore. Both great courses! The Sanctuary is a VERY tight desert course, while the Biltmore is a traditional course.

They are not the nicest Hilton rooms, but the are great for a family. We stayed in the North building in a 1 bdrm suite. It was nice to shut the doors and watch tv while kids slept. There is only one sink, but there is a dressing area in the bedrooom. The price is actually good. We have relatives that paid the same at a basic Best Western and they didn't have near the pool areas that we had. We had a great pool right by our room and when we wanted a change we wandered off to the River ranch, something my children enjoyed thouroghly. The food at the hole-in-the-wall for breakfast was good. The dinner a bit pricey and only average. I suggest you rent a car and try some of the other restaurants that Phoenix has to offer. If you don't have a Cracker Barrel restaurant where you are from search one out while here. They are the best. Also Aunt Chiladas is just O.K. If you come from an area with good Mexican food you will not enjoy this restaurants version. Try to eat at Macayos. Much better.

I'm pretty much in overall agreement with that reviewer's comments. The rooms are dark and average (ours smelled so strongly of room freshener it was nauseating). The decor is standard Hilton hotel room; nothing imaginative or interesting. If you came with kids, you'd probably appreciate the pools and activities. We don't have kids, and aren't really into the Disney-themed plastic decoration (including a fake old western town store front theme). I thought the price of $200 per night was pretty high for what you got. The spa is, in my opinion, very misleadingly described as one of the 10 best in Arizona. I don't know what list they are working with, but I can't imagine that is the case. I booked a $165 massage. The massage itself (by Ron) was quite good. But for that kind of money, there's usually a pretty nice spa experience that goes along with it. In this case, I checked in, and the girl at the counter didn't even offer to take me to a locker room and give me a robe! I had to ask for that. The locker rooms are your regular gym-type locker room. There is a co-ed steam room and sauna. No whirlpool. After I saw a man in the steam room stretching his hamstrings in full workout gear (including gym shoes), I wouldn't have gone in the steam room if you paid me! The showers are badly in need of an overhaul -- mildewed, no water pressure. The waiting room is basically on a sofa in the beauty salon -- strong smell of nail varnish. During the massage, the table rocked throughout (it needed some sort of repair), and everytime water turned on in the hair salon you heard it loudly. One nice place to hike -- the Phoenix Mountain Park (east on Glendale past Highway 51). Great nice hikes -- although you have to drive about 10 minutes to get there. The Aunt Chiladas place was a good place to grab a bite.

We checked in early, had a very nice suite (asked for non-smoking, king, and not first floor and all were accomodated). Also got a $90 (+tax, etc.) per night rate on Pricline so that was a bonus. Pros- nicely kept grounds, friendly staff, great pool. We do not have kids (I'm 8 months pregnant actually), but we still enjoyed the place very much as a couple seeking a final pre-kid escape. Our room was quiet, the pool(s) were spacious enough for all comers on a holiday weekend during high season, and our bed was absolutely wonderful. We're not typical resort folk (more the bargain hunting type), so this place was a wonderful treat for us. We also had a rental car- if you didn't you might be limited as there's not much close by except the hotel restaurants and shops. Minor cons- the suite has a nice kitchenette but the small fridge is locked and overstocked with items for charge-- the hotel information says \"do not store personal items in the fridge due to spoilage concerns\" or something. That's a bit ridiculous. We never opened it for fear of excess charges. It would have been nice for us to be able to use the kitchen for easy breakfasts, and keep our own milk and oj and leftovers in the fridge. Also, the remodeled Lantana grill has no atmosphere and is overpriced. Our beef satay appetizers were great but the quesadilla we ordered was horrible. I'm glad we didn't order big expensive dinners- a family seated behind us was clearly unhappy with how long it took to get their meals and how they were done.

Staff were all very nice and wanted to be helpful; however, most were young and inexperienced.

When we saw all of the pictures on the hotel website of this hotel and its amenities, we were pretty excited. However, the pictures and the hotel itself do not live up to expectations. First of all, even though the pictures on the hotel website show this gorgeous view of the mountains from your room, this is hardly ever the case. Our room was actually on the ground floor, in an inside courtyard. There was a tiny patio, perhaps 2 feet wide in length (see picture) with a cement wall in front of it, so you could see nothing from your room but the cement wall. The rooms are all suites, which is nice, there is a sitting room, with a lumpy couch, a tv, and a coffee-maker (no tea, though) and the water from the taps are undrinkable. You can buy bottled water for $6.00 a bottle, or get water from water fountains all around the hotel, which is probably filtered and tastes a lot better. The bathroom is so small that the bathroom door grazes the toilet when you try to shut it. The sinks are in a separate alcove, with a nice shaving mirror, hair dryer supplied, nice Crabtree & Evelyn Toiletries, and two nice robes are supplied as well. The bedroom does have a comfortable bed, adequate closet and dresser space. Since our suite was on the ground floor, we had to keep the curtains in the sitting room closed all the time, since that room faced the courtyard. The bedroom was the room with the patio and brick wall. This also meant that we could never open any doors to get ventilation, since the screen on the patio door was broken. Housekeeping was adequate, no complaints there. The hotel states that there are many walking trails in the mountains nearby. That is true, but what they do not tell you is that in order to get to those walking/hiking trails, you need to actually drive there, it would be about a 3-4 mile walk. However, you are not permitted to park anywhere near the trails. You would have to park at the hotel and walk to the mountain trails. There was only one restaurant that was open, and that was The Hole In The Wall. The other restaurant, The Lantana Grill, was still closed for renovation. The food at The Hole In The Wall was not all that good, and it was expensive. We ate breakfast at the hotel twice because we did not know where else to go at first. If you smoke, you have to sit in the bar, or sit outside. Breakast was around $10.00 a person, and for that you would get eggs, breakfast meat, some nasty fried potatoes, biscuits and fried bread. We had dinner once in the restaurant, and once was enough. The fried rattlesnake was good to try, and you get a t-shirt for trying it, but that cost $38.00. I had the prime rib, which tasted like it had been reheated in a microwave. For around $23, it was not that great. There was nothing special about the food or the menu. The one night we ate dinner there, since we smoke we did sit in the bar to eat, and there was a couple there with four children. This was at 9:00 pm, the couple was quite inebriated, and the four children were screaming, obviously tired, and out of control. We honestly thought that the bartender should not have continued to serve the parents, but I just think she was hoping they would simply go away. It was not a pleasant meal. There is a nice fire pit on the patio outside the restaurant, and we went by several times on several evenings, hoping to be able to sit outside there and have a drink, but the fire pit was never lit. The property itself is lovely. There are many pools, and the one plus to our room location was that it was literally steps away from the pool and hot tubs. The hot tub was great, we used that every single night. The pool was chilly, but still coming from Delaware, where it had been 12 degrees when we left, we were thrilled to be able to be sitting in a pool outside anywhere in December. We took a stroll through the water park, which would be very nice if it had been slightly warmer. I think there are a lot of activities here for kids, but for adults there is not all that much to do. On the plus side, the concierge service is excellent. We had never been to Arizona before, and wanted an idea of some places to visit. The concierge gave us all sorts of brochures, detailed directions, and they were extremely friendly. However, Western Town is not open at this time, since they were moving the entire town to a reservation. We drove all the way there, only to find out it is still under construction. Parking can be a nightmare if there is any kind of function going on at the hotel, which seems to be often. On a Saturday evening there were at least three huge parties and the traffic was a nightmare, with cars driving all over the place, in the wrong lane, and not enough personnel to direct the cars anywhere. It was like New York City at rugh hour. It took almost 1/2 hour to get from the entrance of the hotel to a space reasonaly near our room. That was ridiculous. The hotel is located in the middle of nowhere. Well, not in the middle of nowhere, but you have to drive to get anywhere. If you come for a conference with your spouse, and the spouse takes the car, you would be stuck at the hotel, as I was, with nowhere to go. If you think ok, you can sit in your room and look at the mountains, as I thought I would be able to do, forget it. You will sit looking at that brick wall. The hotel does offer a shuttle, however, to the two malls in Scottsdale for a cost of $10 and $15.00. The layout of the hotel is very confusing. The buildings are not marked, and so if you come in at night, as we did, we drove around forever trying to find our building. Lighting is poor. The hotel charges an additional $9.00 a day for use of facilities, such as the water park, miniature golf, etc., but they will remove this charge if you do not use those facilities. The entire staff is very friendly and accomodating, and does make you feel welcome. There is a gift shop in the hotel, with items you could find in a million other touristy gift shops, and the prices were about the same as everywhere else. If you want a decent breakfast for a lot less money and a lot more character, I would suggest driving to the 5& Diner, which is about a 10 minute drive away. The place is cool reproduction of a 1950's diner, the waitresses wear poodle skirts, the diner has the metal box-car look, juke box music inside, checkered floors, and the food is great. The prices are really good, half of what the prices are at the hotel. Don't miss the chicken fried steak platter for breakfast. A nice dinner alternative is about a block from the hotel, called Aunt Chilada's. Its' a Mexican restaurant, good food, great prices, good drinks, and you can sit in a beautiful outdoor heated patio, surrounded by fountains, birds and trees. It was a really pleasant adult experience. The hotel will give you a list of recommended restaurants within an hour's drive. We tried to get to one of the restaurants that was supposed to be a cowboy grill that seemed a lot of fun, but the directions on the sheet were wrong, they simply ended at the critical point, and after driving for over an hour in the horrible rush hour traffic, we never did find the restaurant. We ended up driving back to another restaurant recommended by the hotel, Don and Charlies, and that was also disappointing, as well as expensive. If you are planning on visiting any museums while on your vacation, take note that all museums are closed on Mondays. It would have been nice had we been told this when the conceriege gave us the directions to the museums, saving us a trip into downtown Phoenix. One thing to be aware of, when you get those directions, it states an approximate time of how long it will take you to get there. In almost every case, add at least one hour to that driving time. When we went to Sedona, definitely a place not to be missed, the directions stated it was about a 1 1/2 hour drive. It took us 3 hours, and my husband is a fast driver. When we went to visit The Apache Trail, another not-to-be-missed sight, but not for the fainthearted or anyone with a large car, the directions stated again about 1 1/2 hours, and it took us 2 hours to drive there. Arizona is a beautiful state, and we can't wait to go back again, but with all of the hotel options available, we would not stay here again.", "Date": "December 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Silicon Valley, CA", "Title": "\u201cA 3-Star Hilton, Not a 4-Star Resort\u201d", "Author": "Onmessage1", "ReviewID": "UR4228643", "Content": "This hotel has very nice rooms -- it's an all-suite property with excellent new beds.

ROOMS: We had a suite of sitting room with sofa sleeper and bedroom with 2 doubles. The first night we were in the south pointe block, very dated rooms with vanity at end of bed in main bedroom and only 4 small drawers for 5 peoples clothes for a week's stay!!!! The paint was flaking off the woodwork, the room smelled dirty even though it looked clean, and the bathroom was the most basic and I thought the smallest bathroom I have experienced in the USA. We had just spent all day driving so we just shut up and put up. Next morning we got transferred over to the north pointe block to an updated room on the ground floor which I had said was OK but the desk clerk failed to mention that there was a five foot screen blockwall enclosing our tiny patio because it adjoined the car park, the suite was tidier but the bathroom was even smaller than the first, a very short tub but slightly better shower head, thankfully the vanity had its own recess seperate to the bedroom and was pretty with granite countertop and nice fittings. You could only get out one side of the beds as I found out when I got up in the night and crashed into the wall and I am quite petite! There was more clothes storage though. Suites are better suited to a 4 people occupancy than 5, my teenage son was not amused that the maid had walked in 3 times by 8am, he was on the sofa sleeper and waiting to shower, he made sure he used the do not disturb sign after that. Registration told us that they were sorry we had been wrongly advised, we should have booked a casita. FOOD: We were advised to take out the bounceback breakfast package at an extra $20 + tax a night and that kids breakfast was free, our kids ages were on the confirmation slip so reservations knew 2 of them were over the age 12 cut off for kids meals. Bounceback breakfast only costs $8-50 at the table so it is cheaper to pay or charge it at the table on a daily basis than to purchase vouchers in advance, kids breakfast is not included but it is only $4, but our breakfast bill was an extra $15-$20 daily on top of what I had been quoted, we got another I'm sorry, you were misinformed. Also check your restaurant bill, ours was wrong 3 days out of 4 and the bounceback breakfast options varied depending on your server despite being written clearly on the menu- we opted to skip breakfast after that as we couldn't face any more meals there or any more 'I'm sorry but you were misinformed' comments - the other restaurant was closed. The restrooms in the hole in the wall are labelled 'squatters' and 'standers' which I actually found offensive. RIVER RANCH: The nightly rate only covers 4 people per suite, extra kids are $10 daily, another 'I'm sorry but you were misinformed' as I specifically asked if all resort fees were included for all 5 of us when I booked and was told - yes of course. River ranch has a lazy river (it is actually the river that is lazy, it is so slow you have to paddle yourself in order to move). There is 1 flume type slide, a toddlers pool, 2 swimming pools and a very hot spa, which I liked once they cleaned it out but I was the only one in it, others dipped toes, said ouch and walked away as it was so hot. My 5 year old was kept amused for about the same amount of time as in a regular hotel pool, my older kids were not particularly impressed and actually didn't bother swimming everyday, I had booked the hotel specifically to treat the kids to better pool facilities after they had seen the pool area on the website, they had been looking forward to staying there too. STAFF: Always friendly and courteous and very good at saying 'I am sorry you were misinformed'!!

The \"suite\" was a nice change from having \"just a room\", and the extra television set was great for my daughter. The beds were comfortable and had nice linens and a down comforter (although not what you need in Phoenix in August!!) I felt the room was dark and needed some updating. I don't care for sinks outside the bathroom...and you guessed it...here the sink is outside the bathroom! Initially, when we checked in we were given a first floor South suite location. This room was not to our liking, since it was in a dark part of the building that seemed out of the way! We immediately went back to the desk and they offered us a room on the fourth floor. The room was better...however, the elevator to get to the room had no a.c. and the fan did not work!! We realized this was a problem after we had already unpacked! So for five days, my daughter and I ran up and down the stairs to get to the room while my husband decided to \"tuff it out\" in the elevator! (Note: I told my husband we should complain about the elevator, but he insisted that this is probably something they are well aware of! To be continued...at end of review) They appeared to be doing lots of updating around the premises (but not to the elevator!) The pool area for the \"South\" building was closed due to \"renovations\", however, during our stay, we never witnessed any renovation work going on there! The water park area was nice, and since we were there midweek, there were no crowds to contend with! The lazy river was soooo lazy that sometimes, we actually paddled our way through it! High marks for the cleanliness of the pool area (especially the bathrooms..kept nice and clean!). Ate several times at Hole in the Wall and was very pleased with the food. Had a great waitress the first time we ate there so we were sure to return. This waitress brought to our attention that \"kids eat free\" which we were unaware of! Nice bonus! However, upon our return visits, we were charged for our daughter's meal and had to remind our servers of this! The service got worse and worse with each return trip and we never saw that first waitress again! We ate at Aunt Chilada's and found it to be an excellent dining experience! (great chips!!) Also had breakfast at 5th and Diner and enjoyed it! Every time we wanted to eat away from the hotel, we needed to drive at least 10-15 mins. to do so. I would have liked a hotel that had places to eat and shop that were a bit closer or \"walkable\". Before I selected this hotel for our stay, I read many reviews and selected the Hilton based on the information I gathered. The \"kid-friendly\" factor was key to my selection of this hotel and our daughter did enjoy the water park facilities. I would have liked \"spiffier\" accommodations for my husband and I to feel a bit pampered, but I guess at the rate we got, it was what we paid for! Back to the elevator story....(I didn't forget!!) when we were checking out, I decided to mention to the desk person that the elevator in our part of the building had no a.c. or fan and that it caused lots of inconvenience for us. She said they were unaware of this and that no one else mentioned it!

The positives far outweighed the negatives. Checkin/Checkout - Easy and quick. A bit of pressure from the bellman to have them assist you with your luggage, but the gentlemen who ended up helping us was very nice and helpful. Room - We had a 2 bedroom casita in the back of the resort. The 2 level casita was spacious, clean, comfortable and well-equiped. 3 total TV's, all of good quality and size. High-speed internet is $10/day and worked well. There was a fullsize refrigerator in the casita and a microwave. The casitas are far from new, so there were certainly a reasonable amount of paint cracks, carpet stains, tile disclorations. Nothing that anyplace that age wouldn't have. The air conditioning worked great! Resort - The resort is large and very quiet, considering how many people were there. It is very well kept up, and the views of Squaw Peak are great. The pools did get a bit crowded, but we had no problem finding lounges. Towels were provided at all pool areas. Outside of the main \"water park\", the other pools were quite small, but plentiful. Kids loved the lazy river (it's a bit too lazy I think). A negative for me are that there did not seem to be a bar area that was open late. Also, there did not seem to be a game room or some central location for the kids to congregate. Restaurants - I had numerous meals and drinks at the pool bar. Service was friendly and quick and the prices were reasonable for a resort. If you start a tab there check your closeout bill carefully as I was charged for others orders. It was taken care of by the staff without any issue. I had breakfast one day in the Hole In the Wall and it was quite good and reasonably priced. Location - I mentioned the mountain view earlier and that is a big plus. There is a supermarket and Walgreen right down the street which we found handy. Highway 51 (North/South) is also right down the street and was used often. Fairly close to airport. It's ~ 15 minutes to Scottsdale, so if you plan to spend a lot of time there, you may want to consider one of the many resorts there.

The family had a great dinner every evening and I paid only about $7-10 bucks out of pocket for tip which fed 5 people. We primarily ate at Hole In The Wall restaurant. The food was good and this restaurant is definitely more geared toward family and kids than Lantana, the other restaurant on the property. The rooms were nice, clean, and quiet. We got a 2 double-bed suite. Air-conditioning worked fine even in the hot August days. The kids had a great time at the River Ranch as well as the pool in the South Tower. Two TV's allowed the two boys to watch their programs and not fight. Laundry facilities on 4th floor was easy to use. Cleaning staff was very helpful.

Booked directly through their website & selected a \"Bounceback Vacation\" at $99 nightly which included breakfast for two adults. We were advised during a quick, pleasant and straightforward check-in that \"kids eat free\" on this deal - this was not advertised so came as a very welcome surprise. Optional $9 daily resort passes were explained to us but we were not pressured to buy them. [In fact these seemed to represent very good value when shared by a family who would use the additional facilities]. On booking I had requested only that our room be not too far from pools. We were allocated a \"remodelled\" room top floor North Tower: Yes our balcony overlooked the inescapable car park but directly beyond that only mountains with fantastic view of sunrise [which with jet lag we were able to fully appreciate each morning!].... and excepting the Casitas it was as close as could be to the River Ranch pools. The Hotel and Grounds were attractively landscaped and commendably vigilently maintained. Our suite itself was immaculate - spacious, comfortably but not overfussily furbished, well laid out & generous storage. The bathroom & dressing areas & fittings superb. Wonderfully comfortable Beds and especially the plumpest ever pillows get a special thumbs up. The River Ranch was great for families with younger kids - nothing too hardcore for thrill seeking teenagers mind. One decent Water Slide, [very] lazy river, waterfalls, sporty pools set up for volleyball, basketball etc, kids pools - you name it. It was at all times generously staffed and very well maintained. I was particularly impressed with Poolside RestRooms - which can't be easy to keep spotless all day long but they managed. Refrigerated drinking water was freely available throughout the resort. Pool water was probably more heavily chlorinated than your skin appreciates but certainly not more so than other hotel pools. River Ranch opening hours were from 8.30am to 8.30pm but the good-sized and [while we were there] tranquil courtyard pools and hot tubs are open from 5.30am until... 11pm, I think - so if you are noise sensitive you might not appreciate being allocated a ground floor room in this area. The Kids Koyote Club was way out of our budget to send the Kids just for the fun of it if you were remaining on-site [about $60 per child per day session I think?] but no dobt a valuable service for those here on a conference or needing some time out. They also offered a great $5 midday movie & popcorn to entice the kids out of the midday sun. We ate three times at the Hole in the Wall Restaurant: Two breaksfasts and one dinner. Service and food both consistently exceptional - very child friendly indeed. The lovely location of the terrace overlooking the River Ranch is the icing on the cake. Lest this review read like I am a share-holder [although after this experience I might just consider?] let me say that our only negative experience was a breakfast at the Lantana Grill [this place seems more oriented to Squaw Peaks other key market - Conference - than family market]. On our visit here customers seemed to be outnumbered by staff about 3 to one yet it took 20 minutes to have our order taken and another 30 for our breakfasts to arrive - when it did the orders were wrong but we were running so late by then I confess we let it go. Lantana Grill menu prices seemed comparable to Hole in the Wall but neither portions nor quality of food was close. The staff stood around in large groups talking and ignoring us. When I visited the restroom it clearly hadn't been checked for hours as the bins were flowing over and the wet floor strewn with wet towels .. and crawling along the foor I saw the only cockroach I spotted in the entire resort grounds. We also dined at the adjacent Aunt Chiladas Mexican which has been enthusiastically reviewed on this site. I confess I was very disappointed with the food which appeared at our table in the blink of an eye after our orders were taken ........ and was bland and overcooked. However I do have to admit their complimentary chips & dips are as good as any I ever tasted and the ambience was great! We were fortunate to visit midweek when the resort was lively enough to be buzzing but not in any way crowded. As we were leaving [start of July 4 holiday weekend] the hotel was clearly heavily booked and getting hectic - possibly I may not have enjoyed that weekend quite so much. Nor would it be my first choice for a romantic weekend away from the kids. I have no doubt that there are more exclusive resorts in Phoenix - with plusher pool towels, but in this price range? - at $99 daily with a delicious & generous breakfast for four, lovely environment to relax in, all day entertainment poolside without having to fork out an extra penny ... and the best nights sleep away from home - why it quite distracted me from lamenting the heat!

My family loved the River Ranch water park that contained a 'lazy river' where we floated on rafts at a leisurely pace and enjoyed a refreshing waterfall in the large pool. The pools that were in our suite complex provided my family with a peaceful retreat when they wanted to relax or swim in a garden area close to our room. We had lunch in the Hole-in-the-Wall restaurant that serves good meals in a casual setting (even provided free drink refills to-go without anyone asking for them!). The conference facilities were among the best I have ever seen. The conference rooms were set near desert patios that contained large planters full of trees and flowers where we could sit and talk.

The first room we were given was a handicapped room (we're not handicapped but the room was very spacious!!!), and it had no seal on part of the door, so bugs could come right in, you could see a lot of light on the bottom of the door. I notified the front desk and requested a new room. We were moved to a different room, but realized it had the same problem. I didn't want to be a bother and request a third room, so we stayed. Also, the ceiling on the patio appeared to be moldy, it had black splotches all over it. Someone from housekeeping came in our room without knocking right after we got settled in and were getting ready to go swimming. My daughter was completely naked putting on sunscreen in the front room (had a room with a front room near the main door and a bedroom). This lady just stood there with the door wide open trying to hold a conversation with me while my child was standing there naked. She didn't leave until I told her to \"Get Out!!\" That was the worst experience for my daughter. She was so embarrassed! The bathroom sink was nearly impossible to turn off and it dripped constantly if you didn't use all of your strength to turn it off. Then our dinner at Hole In The Wall was so burned, it was not edible. Not to mention I asked for no onions and no peppers, I got both, but I didn't get the tomatoes that were supposed to come with it. The manager was great about that, he didn't charge us for the meal and gave us dessert for free too. That was nice and our other meals there were fine. I had a magnetic \"Organ Donor\" ribbon stolen off my car while we were there. Room service took about an hour to deliver and the quality of food was poor. The salad actually made me sick. They also had some sort of sports teams there and the kids were running all over the hotel very late. They were knocking on doors and being very loud. I called the front desk and they said they would put a stop to it. They didn't. The final straw for me was the salon. I went to Toca Sierra Salon for highlights. The next day, it was not even noticeable that I had it done. They used too dark of a color, so I spent another hour there getting it re-done. Including tip, I spent $100, and it wasn't a good job. It's so far from the roots, it looks like I need to have it re-done already, and I do. After returning home, I contacted the salon manager. She was awesome about the whole situation and is refunding me all of what I spent and sending a certificate for a free massage. I have yet to hear back from the hotel manager in order to get the hotel-related matters resolved, but at least the salon was quick to respond and was very helpful in the situation I encountered. I guess if you do choose this hotel, make sure your doors are locked at all times and check the room they give you top to bottom before you unpack and ask for a different room if you see a problem.

My wife asked if our son had arrived and was told \"yes.\" \"Was he given a key to our room?\" \"No, because he hadn't a picture ID!\" \"But he has his passport - he just flew in from Montreal,\" my wife said. \"Lower your voice when you're speaking to me!\" the man replied, though I didn't note anything extraordinary in her tone. His escapist reply might have been comical, were it not so rude. \"But we arranged for him to be given a key...\" my wife continued, nearly whispering, and glancing to her side at the (formerly) smiling girl who was now leaving the reception area to escape any possibility of becoming involved. I was wondering what the man would say in regard to the passport - obviously our son could not fly in without an adequate picture ID. \"Don't point your hand at me!\" the man instead replied, though all my wife was doing was resting her right hand (she was holding our car keys) on the countertop, while her left hand was still holding her purse. That desk clerk could be termed a cretin, a loose cannon, an untrained or idiot \"Faulty Towers like\" clerk - whatever - but I have little inclination to ever return to that hotel just because of him and the \"smiling girl\" who apparently feared involvement because her colleague had probably intervened and refused my son a key. The Pointe's grounds at Squaw Peak are extensive. We searched for our son for nearly an hour before we found him - our paths between the Hole in the Wall and Dantano restaurants and the pool, convention center and room nearly crossed several times, till finally we called for the Nth time on one of the hotel phones and received word he'd \"checked in\" What a joke! It was after 4:00 p.m. We also received a message on our room phone to that effect. The following day, the idiot clerk graced with us a perky \"good morning\", etc., while the \"smiling girl\" avoided looking. I felt a strong inclination to answer his \"good morning\" with \"Don't raise your voice at me!\", but why escalate things with a moron. They've got a great water park - and maybe it justifies dealing with idiots. I'll leave that matter to other guests to balance out. Some items in our room were non-functional (e.g. high-speed Internet), but I could easily have overlooked them - in fact, one can overlook a lot of small deficiencies, if only the staff is civil.

We stayed in one of the two bedroom Casitas and although it was clean it did have an old musty smell. The Cicada was very out-dated and in need of a few upgrades, particularly the carpet. They spared no expense on the beds. The beds were very comfortable with down blankets and pillows. My 9 year old daughter said that this wouldn't be a 3 star hotel if it wasn't for the beds. The Hole in the Wall restaurant was good food and average service. The first couple of meals were fine but one morning for breakfast we waited over 40 mins. And never saw our food or water again. We had to track him down in order to get our bill because my wife had meetings to attend. They did box up my food to take with me at no charge. They informed us that they were very busy that morning and apologized. The service by the pool was horrendous. There were very few people to take care of a very large area. We had an average wait time of about a half hour for a drink. At one point a server had noticed that a half dozen flags on our lounge chairs were up and he told us that our server was busy and he walked off and sat down next to a girl sun bathing and continued to talk to her while we waited. When our guy did show up there were so many orders to take it was another 20 mins before we received our drinks. Oh, and he forgot my two daughters' drinks... After that I decided to just go to the bar (Slim Picken's) myself. Only problem here is there isn't enough staff to service all of the servers and people at the bar and people that can't get served. While my wife was in meetings we were at the pool and the service continued like this for three days until my very hungry wife (day 3) who was never served breakfast met us by the pool for lunch. We figured a hotdog lunch and drinks but we only saw one server and because of this the line at the bar was about a 30 min wait. My wife had called to let the manager know that the pool was way under staffed and that if we can't get served and can't bring anything into the pool area, how were we going to eat? The manager sent us the director of the Slim Picken's and Hole in the Wall. This guy was very nice and apologetic and offered to get us a seat at the Hole in the Wall but we informed him that there was a chance we would get served because or our earlier experience at breakfast. This man not only personally served us lunch by the pool but he completely fixed the pool services problem. Six people showed up and all the lines went away. Servers were walking around asking if you wanted anything because everyone was taken care of. He also to our surprise took care of our dinner bill that night. We also ate at the Aunt Chiladas restaurant. Very good food and it could have been a coincident but we had an ok service the first night so we went back the next night and in took about two hours from time we sat down to the time we got our bill.

We arrived in the pouring rain. It was flooded everywhere but we didn't mind cause there was no snow! Our check in went very smoothly. We were offered bellhop service but chose to find our room ourselves. We had requested that we be away from the 24 hour pools (less noisy) and on the top floor if possible. Both our requests were met. Our room was clean, spacious and even had a microwave! Our view was of the parking lot but was partially screened by a huge palm tree growing right outside our window. We were at the very end of the row of rooms closest to the side entrance into the complex.-good because there weren't people walking back and forth in front of our room... bad because the view wasn't great from either window! (Also the garbage truck came in the side entrance and you might be disturbed by the noise) We bought the BounceBack package which gave us food vouchers for breakfast every day at either of the two restaraunts on the property. A very good deal (We loved both of them) .Lantana had great Mexican shredded beef! Hole in the Wall was more fun being right outside by the pool. Suggestion to those who have read this far... get there early 'cause it fills up fast. We never ate the buffet because there were so many other tasty things on the menu. As for lunch, we broke the bank and ordered poolside, heh you only live once! The quesadillas were quite good! Dinner we went off property. Aunt Chilladas across the street was very good. Large servings of Mexican and reasonably priced. It is a hike from the far side of the property, so have the bellman drive you over in his cart! We went way out of town to a place that had sawdust on the floor and neckties hanging from the ceiling (this place was in one of our guide books, maybe Frommers) and it was a waste of money. Sorry I can't recall the name! The pool... lots of fun, even for my 12 and 13 year old boys. They enjoyed floating very slowly (it was very crowded and bottle necks occurred lots) down the lazy river and they also had fun in the larger pool as well. Another hint for those who are still reading... the lounge chairs can be very hard to get especially under an umbrella. Make sure to get up early and get down to the pool so that you can get a chair. I mean stand in line at the pool entrance before it opens , lots of others will be there already, I promise you!!! (Warning -Don't try to save a chair by sneaking in early thru the tennis courts - there are empoyees who watch for this tactic and will take your stuff away or send you back out on your way!!! First hand experience!) We had fun playing tennis; choosing early morning or evening court times to avoid the heat. Be sure to book reservations because they too fill up! Have fun.

We ate from the pool food/bar which was fine, and then at the Hole in the Wall for dinner and then breakfast. It is not that overpriced compared to any full-service hotel. If you want to purchase the hotel service package for $9, you receive an additional admission to the water park (we had 4 with our room), unlimited use of the fitness facility, miniature golf, 2-for 1 ice cream, etc. We will definitley stay here again.", "Date": "June 12, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norman, OK", "Title": "\u201cfine for family\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2179890", "Content": "...advertised as a suite, but terribly small.

We did have to wait on our room, but the hotel gladly held our luggage until the room was ready. The food in all of the restaraunts was wonderful and the drinks were happily served and worth the amount paid. We have absolutely no complaints and would highly recommend this resort. The pools were almost to yourself and the room was wonderful and clean.

We stay in a two bedroom casita which has its own pool. Never crowded! You can get up in the morning and take a dip all by yourself if you wish... or even in the afternoon! I have read the other reviews about the drink prices and food prices being expensive... I don't think their prices are any higher than any other resort. What do you expect ... This is a 4 star resort! It makes me wonder have they been staying at Holiday Inn's on their vacations or what? This is a great resort, I usually go on cruises but this is by far equal to any of cruise for a good vacation.

I keep coming back because I think it has everything. On my first trip I came alone as I was meeting up with family who live nearby. I was well looked after by the staff and found the staff really helpful and pleasant. On the 2nd trip, I was with my sister. I just had to let her see the fantastic place where I had stayed on my previous trip. We had a great time and althought this was 4 years later some of the staff still recognised me. We dined at each of the resorts restaurants, The Hole In The Wall, Lantana Grille and Aunt Chilada's. We really enjoyed them all and our favourite is Aunt Chilada's. They have everything there including great staff. A regular bar area which is nice any time you want to just drop in. A restaurant area inside and outside. Also a great back area for evening entertainment, food and drink. My 3rd trip was with my friend for her 50th Birthday. I had raved about this place so much that a holiday here was the only thing she wanted to do to celebrate this milestone. This place is for all ages. We are no spring chickens, but we can still enjoy great food, great music and meeting new people of all ages. The guys at Aunt Chilada's really made it special for us when we told them it was her birthday. And they had all remembered me from my previous trips. I think that this place is what you make it. This summer, for my 20th wedding anniversary, I thought it was about time I took my husband to sample the pure delights of Arizona and YES we will be staying at the Hilton at Squaw Peak. I am sure that he will love it just as much as I do. And if anyone sees Jimmy from the pool bar and T-Bone, Greg, Antonio and Shula from Aunt Chilada's tell them I said Hi. This will not be my last holiday to Arizona and definitely not the last time I will stay at this hotel.

Walking across the street to get takeout at Aunt Chilada's restaurant was much better. On arrival, after flying all day, we wanted to check in an hour or so early.
