The hotel is really nice for the area. Its Nothing too fancy, but given the other hotels in Daytona, its probably one of the nicest. The pool and beach area is a little too crowded for my taste but with a hotel that big, its to be expected. A few of the goods and bads. The goods: Big, clean hotel with nice, comfy rooms and beds. Our room was through an independent owner and it was really nice but i saw into some other rooms and they all looked cozy. The place is big. It has two towers and a helpful, patient staff. The indoor golf was a nice plus as was the lazy river and the waterslide. The location is the best on the beach, as the hotel connects with a crosswalk to a water park and an outdoor multilevel shopping area, complete with bars and restaurants. Also there is a huge auditorium-like stage right there on the boardwalk, where they had bands playing. The bads: The elevators are slow. SLOW. I found myself taking the stairs (coolers, beach chairs and umbrella in hand), because of the wait. The beach chair rental service was another negative. They set up rental chairs behind the hotel on the beach very early in the morning. But they take up nearly the whole beach, so if you happen to bring your own chairs and umbrella, you have to squeeze into a spot to set up. Its pretty crowded. Reminds me of the rear of La Vela in Panama City Beach. And lastly, (and this may only happen on certain days) was the parking. We went to eat one night and came back and was told we had to park across the street in a parking deck. Kinda annoying but no biggie, as the parking deck is connected by a crosswalk. The aggravation comes during the process of getting your car out. The hotel apparently leases spots from this parking garage and covers the cost of parking when Their own lot gets full. Getting your car is a hassle. You have to park and walk into an office then sign some papers, then they give you a key card to exit, then you have to take your card back to front desk or you will be charged $50. It was just too much walking and agggravation. But all in all it was a great stay, I would go back. I think, given the cost, we will try somewhere different next year. But it was still a great stay. And in a great spot. PS...There is NO driving on the beach behind this hotel. So if you bring towels and chairs and coolers...keep in mind that you will have to carry all that stuff.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA day in Daytona Beach\u201d", "Author": "Maryjoe1832", "ReviewID": "UR139283071", "Content": "Well in Dayton there's some rides and all the souvnier shops you could want.

So as I always do I'll take u from pull up to check out. It's in a great location central to all that is Daytona. As we arrived we were greeted by a guard that guided me to the check in desk. Once there I was greeted by a really nice lobby and an equally nice receptionist who made short work of the check in process. I mount my noble steed and I start my trek up the turns of the parking garage. After getting as close as I could to the 13th floor I parked and made our way to our room we were in the south tower in room 1314. I open the door and was greeted by a pleasant smell and well decorated room with small stove,fridge,micro,and all the comforts of home. Being tired from the travel it was bed time I crawled into a very nice kingsized bed a sleept like a very tired baby. I wad awaken by my son saying dad come on let's go of course its 7 am at this point I roll from my slumber nest and put my trunks on don the sun block and away we go. We start off at the lazy river which was empty at 9 am but the kids didn't really love it sure it was fun but the tubes that you have to use are for adults not 6 and 4 year old frames so when seated in the proper relaxed floating position they would fall through the hole in the center of the tube which meant they would have to take this journey aboard the SS daddy that's right they road my back as I road the tube...its ok you will figure it out in a minute anyway not the most fun activity. So.we moved to the muddy splash pad also empty at this time we had fun here some of the spray nozzles were broken or wouldn't turn off but not something the kids paid any attention to we played here for a good hour before the water slide open at which point of course won over the splash area the slide is nice a pretty low speed but you do have to be 42\"tall to ride it dumps into the shallow end of the pool with plenty of picture taking room for all of us parents that are crazy like that. All of the amenities that used were great this looks like the place that both parents and couples can have fun with something to do for everyone.

Lots of entertaining activity. We are Wyndham owners, so we only book through Wyndham using our points, we've never had a problem in the 13 years we've been staying at this resort. I can understand where confusion could happen. There are units that people own, they rent out themselves and Wyndham has nothing to do with. There are units that are rented out on the internet, etc. (This seems where a lot of problems happen, overbooking, downgrading, etc.) And using traditional Wyndham points (this is what we do). We've always had a good experience, always got the room we booked. There are 2 towers. Each tower has a different security company, confusing. The pool is always busy, so we save up and rent an umbrella and chairs for the week, and stay on the beach everyday. You can get in a pool anywhere. This is a Timeshare resort, not a hotel, there is no maid service. Most units have a washer/dryer. We stay in a one bedroom deluxe unit, very spacious, whirlpool tub, full kitchen. This is an area that you can park your car and leave it parked all week. The only time we got in our car was the first day to get some groceries from Publix. We love this resort and plan to be back every year. One tip also, a smile and a friendly attitude is much better than screaming if there is a problem.

Instead we had to walk down the block to the small grocery store on the corner. Not a big deal, but a minor inconvenience. There was some confusion at the pool area when it stormed. I guess one pool and the kiddie pool is overseen by a separate group of security than the lazy river and pool with a slide, and because of this, one side was open and one side was closed, which was very confusing to guests.

We did enjoy the stay and the property. Checkin.....We arrived at a good time and line moved pretty quickly. Over our stay we did see the line short at times and long at others. It is really hit and miss, They told us that Friday, Saturday and Sunday checkins are busier. The room.....The room was great. We had a 2 bedroom with a side ocean view. The view was not as good as ocean front, but still not bad at all. The room had everything in it that we would ever need, always does. The deck area.....Well, on a summer weekend, if you are not on the deck by 8am, you are going to have trouble getting a lounge chair. This July was busier at the resort than our last visits. Of course the beach is always available. We like how they have security making sure that the kids do not get too crazy in the river and around the pool. Bonnet Creek in Orlando could learn a thing or two from Ocean Walk. Also, I hate when one person comes down and puts towels on 5 chairs and then goes back upstairs for 2 hours. We asked the guards about this and they said they cannot do that, but they did and no one said a word or moved any towels off. I guess people will do it as long as they can get away with it. Another thing, the pool bar closed early every day. This makes no sense to me. Come 8pm, there would be countless people who would want to sit on the deck, have a drink and relax. They are losing money and the guests are missing out on a nice amenity. Other items.....Yes, wireless internet is only in the lobby. This visit, we really did not use it. We were just there to chill. The kids liked the karaoke in the bar at night. The kids liked the free indoor putt-putt when it got too hot or rain was threatening. Lazy river is always nice.

Later to find out it was the wrong room, after awakening my entire family. No apologies were made by property management nor security. No WI-Fi Cable went out but was available in bar (Room cable was out for entire night) We have given original reservation rep our credit card, in regards to security deposit, yet we were ask again at check in to give another ($150) deposit. Basically, card was charged twice for one deposit.

We've had great stays here, and only sub-par stays. This particular stay was about middle of the road. The buildings are clean, though they seem a little like they're becoming run down. It was just a few little things I noticed here and there, though nothing that stood out as red flags. The pools are nice, though the indoor pool was down right gross. It had way too much chlorine in it and about as much hair. We went in one afternoon when it was storming really bad (as it does frequently in Daytona) and that was the one and only trip to that pool. My son loved the kiddie area and the lazy river though! As for amenities - I love the fact that they do kiddie things every day, though i wish they did even more. My son was too young for such activities (only 1) but when we've stayed elsewhere, they had several organized activities every day and made sure that the activities were well posted. I'm not sure if we just didn't know about them or they didn't have them, but I'd love to see more of those. I feel like they had more several years ago, so maybe budget cuts has hurt that aspect? I also wish the little store had more options in it. Since most of the units have kitchenettes (or full kitchens), I think some basics would be handy such as bread, butter, etc. The most frustrating thing about the trip was our door lock. Nearly every time we went out, the door lock stopped working. We thought it was our keys for the first 2 days, but then we had multiple maintenance folks up and even their master keys did not work, confirming it was the lock. Then the finger pointing began: the owner of the unit said that it was the building's job to fix it, and the front desk said that the owner had to take care of it. Thankfully we had a larger unit with a second door, so we were able to get in, but it was incredibly frustrating to have to constantly get them to reset the door lock, which of course only fixed the issue for a few of us for a few hours before breaking again. And to boot, the elevators are the slowest I've ever encountered. It's not a bad place to stay by any means. It is family friendly and everyone is fairly nice - both staff and guests. There are 2 pools, a slide for big kids, a lazy river, 3 bars, and a great kiddie area. The location is great as well - near several restaurants, the boardwalk, and the movie theater is right next door for those rainy days. There were several days that we never even had to move our car from the garage. It's just not as great as it used to be and I'm concerned that it could be headed downhill.", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cBeware the Roach Motel!\u201d", "Author": "Cecilia S", "ReviewID": "UR137189067", "Content": "Stayed first week of August, 2012. Beautiful setting and friendly staff, but this property has seen better days. Apparently, since they are the only hotel/motel in town, they feel they can get away with poor, unsanitary management. To call it a \"resort\" is a joke! First, the carpet in our unit was so soiled, one could not even discern its original color! The second day a \"bug\" crawled up the wall behind the couch while we were watching the Olympics. It was a roach! Of course, most all hotels deal with bugs, but what I did not expect was that under the kitchen sink were several dead roaches, and under both BR sinks in the cabinet was roach dirt \"poop\" where housekeeping had laid clean towels on top of without cleaning the cabinet first!! When I complained to the management they referred me to head of housekeeping (a contract company) who is off site. The first time no one showed up. The second time, the lady said she had only been on the job a few weeks and that she was short staffed and that the units are obviously not cleaned properly and need to be renovated. She made no offer to rectify the current situation, but complained about the shortage of permanent housing she could rent to keep her job on the island! We noticed ground staff spraying around the condo units later. The next morning a live 2\" roach chased my son out of his room. That was the last straw! When we left that morning, we complained again to the \"resort\" management, and the Asst Mgr asked us what we wanted him to do as he was not responsible for housekeeping! I wanted at least a substantial discount on our room, if not a refund since we drove 6 hours to get there and there was not an alternative place to stay. In addition: 1. The Mini golf course was old, flooded, mildewed and had leaf/dirt litter all over it. 2. The pool had to be closed at dark, as the Security guard told us know one had bothered to fix the pool lights in quite some time... 3. Two units on our stove did not work, not did the garbage disposal. In fairness, they did send someone to fix those. 4. The toaster burnt toast on one side, even on the lightest setting. 5. They gave us metal cooking utensils to use in Teflon pans. You can imagine what those looked like! The Asst Manager said he would \"have to check with head office about a discount/refund\" since we had pre-paid. It is now a week later. Do you think I have heard anything back?!

Second, the hotel doesn't really have a good restaurant. Just a place to buy pizza that doesnt really look too clean. They offer some snacks that are overpriced, so you have to go somewhere else to get a good meal. No delivery to the rooms because of safety.

We had a wonderful 2 day vacation and a beautiful oceanfront room. When we checked in we were asked if we would like to go to a time share presentation and accepted. They scheduled it for July 21, the day we checked out and gave us a late checkout. Our presentation was 3hours and 15 minutes instead of the 90 minutes they said it would be. While on tour of the resort our sales rep stopped at the front desk and reconfirmed our late check out. When we arrived at our room, after the presentaion, our keys had expired and we had to go back to the front desk and have them remade. Upon arrival back to our room it had been cleaned and everything we had left in it was gone. Before the presentation my husband had taken most of our belongings to the car so we would only have to make 1 trip after the presentation. I had left my bag, which had every thing I had brought with me, including make up, hair blower, curling iron, swim suit etc. etc. etc. We contacted security, housekeeping and night mgr. After 3hours of looking for our belongings they said housekeeping had thrown my bag down the trash shoot. There was also sunglasses and a thermos cup left on the kitchen counter that were never taken to lost and found. They said not to worry, I would be taken care of. The only time they communicated with me was if I called or e-mailed them. Each time I did they responded in a timely manner. After 2 weeks of waiting for a compensation check I threatened to come to the hotel and meet face to face with the Mgr. They immediately sent out, not a compensation check but a Wyndham Gift Card in the amount I had listed for the things I had lost. This was just another inconvienience because most of the things that were taken from me had to be replaced immediately and I can't use the gift card to pay for my purchases. Nothing was offered as far as a stay at the Wyndham for our inconvienience or that we might have a more positive experience. Just a note saying sorry this happened. Customer service is very important to me. I will stay at a 3 star hotel before a 5 star hotel if the customer service is better.

How do we know this? Because when they were talking to the \"manager\" about out room, we pulled out a computer and checked availability. YEP, sure enough, there 2 rooms like the deluxe oceanfront we had booked that were available ... but FOR 3 TIMES THE ORIGINAL PRICE. In a nutshell ... if you stay here, the hotel is fine. Food was \"okay\". Didn't use any of the services so can't comment on that. Beach was nice as well as the pool areas. BUT, if you book here, book ONLY through the hotel. Do NOT use a booking service like hotels.com, etc because then they have an excuse to do whatever they want to you and you have no recourse. They won't refund your money because (according to them) they didn't get your money yet. Fortunately, we booked directly with the hotel and had some leverage when they tried to take advantage of us. Would I stay here again? Not a chance in HELL. And I'll tell everyone who asks about their underhanded business tactics. Stay someplace else is my advice.", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lee's Summit, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cSecond Stay\u201d", "Author": "Pam M", "ReviewID": "UR135837719", "Content": "We stayed here in 2009 and had a good experience.

I arrived at the Wyndham Ocean Walk late in the evening to avoid that lines I read about, I was able to get checked into my room in under 5 minutes, a \"Walk on the Beach.\" We were accommodated in a one bedroom ocean front suite that was more than I imagined. I can honestly say that I was terrified before we arrived, I read the reviews and thought to myself \"SELF-you can find another hotel on the beach if you need too.\" BUT I will almost venture to say that the Ocean Walk was the best I saw on the beach...It is right next to the Hilton hotel which is HUGE but still not as Family oriented as the Ocean Walk. Our Room was suite 1602 A it was a handicap room with an Ocean Front View. The suite was clean, beach chic, and spacious! FYI Guys this is a FAMILY destination resort. So you will experience a lot of children and family. Don't be alarmed.....YES there is a line for the elevators just as there is traffic on the express way when you get off of work. No big deal, after the first day you'll know how to schedule you elevator rides! Your suite features a fully equipped kitchen so there is no need to complain about there not being any restaurants in the hotel. The Wyndham is attached to the Ocean Walk village and features many options for food or snacks. My favorite thing about this hotel was that I felt like I was home. I don't like to use the word cozy because people generally think small. The Wyndham Ocean walk was cozy in a grand type of way. I loved it! Initially I was bummed about the ocean walk not having a spa, but went to a few of the spa's at surrounding hotels and it was the ultimate relaxation.

The lazy river could be crowded at times but it was still relaxing. There was also an indoor pool and weight room that were never used because people ran and walked on the beach!

We are not spoiled adults as we have to save all year for a vacation. I wish we would have gone somewhere else. To begin, upon arrival we had to stand in a long line to check in. This took a little over an hour. We then had to go to yet another desk to schedule our \"tour\" of the facility. We DO NOT do this; you do not have to, but you do have to go through that line to receive your arm bands for the pool. After traveling all day, we were exhausted. We arrived at our room and discovered it was NOT an ocean room delux, which we had reservations for. I had called the Tuesday before our arrival date, and I was told that yes our reservations were in the system and our room was what we were down for. I was told to go back down to the reservation desk and they would help me. Well guess what? I had to stand in an hour long line AGAIN! We DID NOT get our ocean delux; we had to stay where we were and they stated they gave me a better room than what I had! We were NOT the only people they did this to. One owner had made reservations in December and he did not get his ocean delux. So many people we spoke to had this problem! They are screwing the owners over and putting \"prospective\" buyers in these rooms. We had rented our good friend's condo here, and they are trying to sell it. Our room was nice, but not what was reserved. We were on the Atlantic Avenue side. There are 25 floors for each tower and only 4 elevators! One could wait 20 mins. for one of these. We learned to ride up just to ride down to our floor! Everyone complained about this constantly the entire week we were there. Furthermore, they speak of the 3 hot tubs; good luck getting in them. They are filled with junior high students and younger. The pool is always crammed packed and not enough chairs to accommodate everyone. I am telling you it is packed! I teach school and I love my job, but I am definitely not going to back to this family resort! The kids overrun the facility, and of course the parents just let them run alll over. Don't go to Sloppy Joe's for drinks. There is a restaurant called Wings in the walk way and the drinks are $3 CHEAPER and better. Way overpriced! As far as location in Daytona, it is very convenient. I have been to Daytona a dozen times and from this location you can walk just about anywhere. Go to the movies on Tuesdays in the walk way because the cost is only $5. On Friday night the little amphtheatre has local bands that play. Take a short walk to the Oyster Pub; they have happy hour and fresh seafood. You can walk to Froggies and Boot Hill for some local good times. Facing toward the coast there is an IHOP about one and a half blocks north and also a convenient store. Make sure you go to the Deck Down Under. You would head south to the Dunlawton Bridge and go under the bridge not over it. You will see it to the left. it's a great place to eat and you can watch the dolphins feed in the canal. Good food and cold beer. All in all we did not let the room hinder our vacation, but very disappointed in their attitude toward us about that. There is a ton of stuff to enjoy in the Daytona Beach area!

The Pluses - hotel is right on the beach and next door to a small shopping center with movie theater and restaurants. A short walk to the pier and great views of the ocean(ask for a room with the ocean view...not all rooms have it) The rooms are great for a family. THe kitchen has all the amenities you would need for your stay...including blender and bake ware. Washer and Dryers are a big plus! Bathrooms are large, and beds were very comfortable. I even said the fold out sofa bed were unusually comfortable for my boys. THe pool area was great...the lazy river and the two pools are fun for the kids. We had some bad weather on our trip so the indoor pool was a sight for sore eyes. Great security and the beach area is wonderful. They inflate a large slide for kids to play on the beach. There are food trucks on the sand and a small board walk steps off the hotel. Love it! Minuses - We had to change rooms because the safe in our first room was broken. It took them close to 2 hours to resolve the matter. If you have a problem...dont call for asssitance on the phn...go to front desk and ask for manager right away to resolve your problem. I just think there is a shortage of staff for such a large resort. Upon check in you have to go to pick up your beach towels for your stay. They give you one towel per person for your entire visit. Now keep in mind...if you loose these towels your have to sign your life away. They expect you to wash and dry them for your stay there. Tip - bring your own. You can wash them everyday in washer if you have to. They say they have free wifi...but only in lobby area and business center. There is not much to eat on site. The elevators are always full and very slow. So be patient if you plan on staying here. They have 3 hot tubs. One was not working and the others had cold water. The hotel is a great value and great location if you are looking for a beach resort. The pool area is great for he kids. It is noisy so dont expect the peaceful bliss.

Having read numerous reviews beforehand, I was a bit apprehensive as to what we would actually find upon checking in. Many reviewers cited mold in the bathroom, which we did not find. The general traffic areas in the elevators and areas around them were persistantly damp, however given the pool/beach traffic and the general humidity (it rained quite a bit ), doubt much can be done about this. Some of the positives are also negatives: the place is crawling with very young families with oodles of small kids--it is a great place for this, but starts to grate on your nerves a bit. Creates lots of elevator traffic and you wait forever. The decor is pretty outdated, really in need of some updating. No restaurant on site, only a little snack bar w/hot dogs, chips, etc. The bar appears to be nice, good drinks, nice place to hang out, drink specials were very reasonable ($2.00 beers). The garage is pretty well located, you have in/out privileges, so no having to tip a valet. Check out time is rather early, 10am, which is a pain if you are lugging around a lot of belongings, or have teens who are slow moving in the morning. Upon our arrival, we had NO towels. We requested and were brought the towels--one per person- pretty skimpy, however I didn't ask for additional, we made use of the dryer for damp ones. They do not replace, you are expected to launder your own, and they will provide extra detergent for that. There is no \"maid\" service, and not much in the way of cleaning supplies-could've used a broom (only had one of those push-sweepers) or spray cleaner. The kitchen was great, we tried to fix breakfast most days, a grocery store close by. Would have been nice to have been provided some salt and pepper shakers--no one wants to bring/buy this stuff. Having a washer/dryer was super--brought detergent from home. Nice to not have dirty clothes or wet towels. Beach towels are handed out extra, btw, also used for shower towels when we were short. The unit was unplugged--had to call maintenence guy to come move it and plug the thing in, though. We booked a one-BR ocean front--super, super view, loved the balcony. The sofa sleeper (cheap, 2 or 3 in mattress) basically is not useable--my daughter slept on it one night then moved to the xtra bed-- my husb and I crammed in the other double. Not much closet or drawer space--a must for a week long stay with dance costumes. Also the owner's belongings were locked in a large cabinet in the bedroom, taking up more of the already cramped space. Get the feeling there's lots of partying misbehaving--security hovers around the pool, harrasing people to show their plastic armbands (which we were not told about)--I get why the need is there, but really, we were a bunch of adults, 45-60 years or so, how much trouble could we have caused??? Still had a good time, beach is great, lots of decent, fun restaurants nearby. Prob would not stay here on my own--its def. not a HOTEL, its an ownership property, and they do try to rope you in to hear the sales bit.", "Date": "July 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sarasota, Fl", "Title": "\u201cVery few things, ruined the whole trip\u201d", "Author": "mccordck", "ReviewID": "UR133721778", "Content": "We stayed here the end of April 2012 for the Florida States AAU Gymnastics. When I booked this hotel, I was soooo excited. It seemed like the perfect mini vacation for my family. When we got there, we checked in and went to our room. It was awesome and overlooked the beach. They had 2 pools and a lazy river. We immediately got dressed and headed down to swim. It was what seemed like the perfect start of a perfect weekend. We had rooms side by side with my in-laws. When they got there to check in, they got their room key. When they went up, they found there room was not cleaned. Since it was around 4/5PM in the evening, housekeeping could not get their room ready, so they were moved, to a different floor. One of the TVs was missing a remote and when I asked about it, they said there may not be an extra one. I told them, no biggy and left it at that. My husband was more concerned about reporting it so we would not be charged for a missing remote. As I was taking a shower, I noticed a TON of mildew/mold on the inside of the shower curtain. It was not just a day or two amount. It was weeks. It was covered from top to bottom and beyond gross. I pushed it out to the outside of the tub so we would not touch it. After all 4 of us took showers, there was a ton of water on the floor since the curtain was now on the outside. I now felt like the whole room was dirty, so I would not let anyone use any of the dishes in the room. When we came back from dinner, I asked for a new shower curtain along with towels to dry up the floor to be brought to my room. (I also asked for a remote because by then, I was curious exactly what type of customer service they had). She said everything would be sent up soon. About 15 minutes later, someone came with a remote. Then about 45 mins later, I called down as no shower curtain or towels has been brought up. We had to be up early for the gymnastics meet and I was getting upset by then. Finally a lady came. I answered the door, and she handed me the shower curtain. I asked her if she was going to hang it, she gave me a big sign, a rolled eyes and said \"I guess\". I explained there was no way I was going to touch it (by now, I was pissed) and I showed it to her. She kinda gasped and then understood why I refused to change it. She did apologize. I asked her where the extra towels were, and she said she had not been asked to bring me any. She would be back with towels. She never returned. I went to bed. The rest of the stay was just \"okay\". Unfortunally, it was ruined by what had happened the day before. It should have been great. We did have fun, they have a ton of great things to offer. But my frustration from the day before and how dirty I felt the room was, really really ruined it. A few days later, I called and asked to speak to a manager. The one on duty was busy so they gave me a voicemail. I never received a phone call back. About a week later, I called again and asked for the actual hotel manager. I was told there was a bunch of people in from corporate and the manager could not come to the phone but if I left a message, I would get a call back. Maybe not that day because of the meeting, but I would. I never did. I was going to go directly to corporate, but I have not yet.

Check in was a breeze. Less than 5 minutes & I was parking the car. (Full Disclosure: After a traffic nightmare, we were nearly two hours late, so that may very well account for my easy check in) As luck would have it, we were placed on the 19th floor of the south tower. This is the top floor of that building, so no pesky footsteps above us. The room was clean & spacious. I had requested two doubles & received one king bed, but that was not a deal breaker. The bed was a bit too hard for my taste, but there were plenty of pillows. The view from the balcony was breathtaking! I could have sat there staring out at the sea for hours...and the first night, I did. The kitchen was well stocked with all the necessary items needed to prepare meals. The living space was quite comfortable & my daughter enjoyed the large flat screen for morning cartoons before hitting the pool & beach. Now, the pool area was very nice, with the exception of several small areas with broken concrete surrounded by caution tape. For what is charged to stay at this resort, there are no excuses for these oversights & they should be repaired posthaste. Because I do not enjoy fighting to the death over lounge chairs on the pool deck, I spent most of my time on the beach. The chair situation at the pool is totally out of control. Plus, they allow smoking poolside and I don't enjoy second hand smoke while sunbathing. None of this mattered once I was on the beach. Once night fell & my daughter was sleeping, we enjoyed sitting on the balcony & listening to the surf. There were several groups of young adults staying a few floors below us. They were having a great time, playing guitars & singing, and were quite good. This didn't bother us at all, but I know some people would not appreciate the show interfering with their serenity. So, book this resort knowing that there is a significant amount of partying & alcohol consumption that may happen in your general vicinity. All in all, we had a great time here. Our room was comfortable & clean, if not luxurious. Do not expect soft beds with high end bedding. Knowing all of this, should we choose to return to Daytona Beach, we will most likely stay at Wyndham Oceanwalk Resort again, provided we were able to stay on one of the uppermost floors with a large balcony because the noise level & partying would make our stay in a lower level room too noisy & disruptive.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cIt was fantastic...\u201d", "Author": "jtslim", "ReviewID": "UR132719791", "Content": "I wasn't sure wat to expect because we have been to other resorts and the rooms are always small compared to what u see online....but this time it was opposite we did not excpect the size of room and the great service...the only downside of this resort is the wait time for an elevator:-(...but overall we enjoyed ourselves and will be back again...", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cUpmarket but disappointing\u201d", "Author": "Keith0507", "ReviewID": "UR132637196", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for a week.It is clean modern and well-appointed but our room had no outside windows which was unpleasant.The pool was really busy.", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay!!\u201d", "Author": "melwilson1983", "ReviewID": "UR132589158", "Content": "We stayed in a two bedroom condo and loved everything about it.

In the morning I noticed there was no coffee maker-an amenity listed in the room description. So I picked up the room phone to call downstairs, but it wasn't working! 20 minutes later, using my cell phone, I finally got thru to the hotel. I asked them to bring up a coffee maker and send a maintenance worker to chec the phone. A man came and said it was the phone line and it was an ATandT problem, and they probably won't come out to fix it Bc it was a holiday weekend. An hour later still no coffee maker so I had to go out into the hallway and use the phone near the elevator to call downstairs. I was told they ran out of coffee makers and I couldn't get one. As a consolation, the woman offered to bring us coffees from the restaurant and she did. Now off to the pool! When we arrive the place is swarming with guests and not a empty chair to be found. So we decide to go down to the beach. But first we need towels so we head back into the hotel for them and found out that they've run out of those too!

(mind you there was a huge bin of dirty towels sitting in the hall all day - no one rolled it away to wash them, though ). As we ended our weekend we still had no coffee maker, a simple request , a broken phone, and i had to continuously rewash our bath towels daily. I will NEVER return to this resort, solely due to the poor service. The hotel is ill-equipped to handle a full house of guests on a holiday weekend. No one knows how to resolve minor issues at all (come on, couldn't someone make a run to a local Walmart and buy a dam coffee maker?? Housekeeping needs to devise a better plan to provide basic pool towels to guests. And if there aren't enough pool chairs to accommodate guests, the hotel should at least provide more chairs along the beachfront so there is enough space for all. My suggestion to those who still want to go: be prepared or be disappointed. Bring your own towels and basic room supplies because the staff won't do a damn thing to help you.", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cWyndham Ocean Walk was a great choice\u201d", "Author": "snowwhite1986", "ReviewID": "UR131336025", "Content": "As soon as school ended, my family decided we needed a little R and R, so we traveled to Dayton for a few beach days.

We were directed to the 6th floor in the South tower (which I\u2019ve read is the oldest tower and the north is better) since the North tower only houses 2-3 bedrooms we had to stick with the south tower (which made me nervous as to what to expect based on reviews). As we entered our one bedroom oceanfront room we found that not only was the room clean, well lit, colorful, bright with a beautiful view\u2026 we also found everything worked included the dishwasher, fridge, air conditioner, and washer and dryer. The staff was very friendly, they brought us extra toilet paper, towels, and trash bags. I\u2019m not sure why people say the elevators by the rooms will drive you crazy because there weren\u2019t any rooms near the elevators that are not the way it\u2019s designed! There is music playing outside by the pool area but it isn\u2019t loud enough to bother anyone nor does it play all night. All pools were clean and the security is very attentive to kids breaking the rules. We stayed for one week (Monday-Saturday) we found that many guest will arrive at the pool early to reserve a chair and not use them but we always managed to find an empty chair. If you have any problems what so ever always ask a staff member, that is what they are there for. I was very pleased with this resort and if we ever return this is where we will be staying.

When I pulled up to check in I was not allowed to park near the front door even though there was room for a car to park. I was sent into the parking garage without my luggage or other property. The check in process was also a mess. I was asked for my car's license plate number, and, since I didn't have it memorized, I had to walk back out to the parking garage and write down my license number to complete the check in process. The rooms themselves were roomy and nice. However, I would have gladly exchanged the room size for a nice hotel room with personable employees and a property with some basic amenities. This property has no restaurant at all. There is pizza and salads available if you can find the lobby bar open. I was there around 3 o'clock on a Saturday afternoon and they were not open yet. I was told to complete the check in process I had to go over to another area to get my \"pool pass and welcome gift\". I did not want a pool pass or welcome gift so I went to my room. I was left several messages that I HAD TO get my welcome gift and complete the check in process. I stopped by the desk and gave them my room number and told them that I did not need my \"welcome gift or pool pass\" as I would not be using the pool and I did not want the \"gift\". This is a time share property and anyone staying here can expect a time share hard sell. So be advised. I wanted out of this property so bad that I got back to my room at 3 a.m. and checked out and left without spending the night that I had payed for in advance. When I went to check out they demanded my Driver's License as a \"security deposit\" for the cart that I had borrowed to bring my luggage down with. I have stayed in hotels for many years and never once in my entire life has a property demanded a \"security deposit\" for a cart for me to bring my luggage out with. I told the desk clerk that and she said that that was hotel \"policy\" and there was nothing she could do. Even though they had my credit card, even though I was paid in full in advance and had no balance with the property they still needed a \"security deposit\". This property is the worst hotel experience I have ever had. Along with no restaurants, bad policy, and rude employees they collected upfront for the stay. I now know why.

There were no children in our party, and this place is all about family with kids. The only real amenities are the pools and beach access, with only a tiny, open lounge off the lobby and a snack shop that is the only \"restaurant.\" There are no shops, no spa, no business center, no concierge, no guest services, and none of the other things you might typically associate with a hotel of this price. It's a one-trick beach resort of very large size but very little dimension. Our room appeared freshly painted, and was clean and quiet -- this is quality construction. The balcony view of the ocean was truly nice. The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare our breakfasts, and a family having multiple meals in-room would find it more than adequate. The room also had its own washer/dryer stack. Downsides include the constant crush of people at the pools and the elevators, of which there are far too few. Be prepared to wait as long as five minutes for an elevator, especially during check-in/check-out times. The facility has far too few luggage carts and, without benefit of cart when checking out, I had to drag luggage for four (including my elderly in-laws' luggage) down a long hall to the elevator, down several floors, back down a long hall, and through the parking lot. When I went to the cart center earlier and was told there were none, the attendant said, \"we have many people checking out this morning.\" And the reason they are unprepared for that is what, exactly? The worst part is, as with the cart attendant, a staff that are mostly indifferent as to your experience during your stay. With a few exceptions, these people just shouldn't be employed at a resort. The worst offender was a very large, semi-blond woman working the front desk one evening. My wife had left her prescription sunglasses in the lounge area that afternoon, and had gone to the front desk to ask if they had been turned in. The large woman told her to come back later, as they were still processing check-ins. Fair enough. My wife returned about 8:00 PM to ask about the sunglasses again; the large woman asked her to describe them, and then said \"Nothing like that has been turned in.\" End of story. When my wife returned to the room and told me this, I went to the front desk; the large woman was occupied, and I quietly asked another woman behind the counter if a pair of sunglasses (I described them) had been turned in that afternoon. She called security, who brought the glasses to the front desk in less than two minutes. When I showed the retrieved sunglasses to the large woman, said that these were the ones my wife was looking for earlier, and asked why she couldn't have called security, she said, \"I'm glad you found them,\" waved me off and turned away. She could not have cared less whether a $300 pair of prescription glasses had been returned to their owner. WHY IS THIS TERRIBLE WOMAN WORKING BEHIND THE FRONT DESK OF A RESORT???? You'll find similar indifference from staff in other areas -- we heard plenty of people grumbling about very poor customer service while riding elevators. In short, if you want a vacation that's all about pool and beach, and want to cook meals in your room, and if nothing goes wrong, this place may suit you.

Also -- the ice maker in my unit did not work AND the ceiling fan made so much noice and wobbled and shook so bad that we could not turn it on. There was also a HUGE hole in the door of the master bedroom and the couch had a rip in it. I could have dealt with the above -- but then around 10pm on wednesday night -- the Rock band at the restaurant next door (we were in a end unit) began to PLAY at 10 PM and played until 2:00 AM -- So when I called the front desk and asked about it -- they said they could not control that and they informed me that the band would play till 2:00 AM I told the front desk that they should have respected me as a person to give me a heads up about the band and inform me about the noise -- and BY THE WAY -- this was a NIGHTLY THING FROM WED THROUGH THE WEEKEND -- I can not even begin to tell you how loud the band was and then the screaming from the people in attendance In my younger days I would have been down with a live rock concert at 10 PM -- but not when I am traveling with guests and elderly parents. I was from out of town and had no idea what was next door to this resort. I felt they owed me the courtesy of informing me about what I would have to deal with being in the end unit.

There were always excuses: just came on shift, didn't know there was a problem, someone else was handling it, new staff members, etc. etc. The bottom line is that this facility is poorly run and has absolutely no sense of customer service. They are nice to you while they take up your vacation time trying to sell you a membership. But once they find out that you are not buying, they seem to have no use for you.

I knew going in that there is no guarantee of room location or view. I did call and request ocean front. Upon arrival, I found there were none facing the ocean, but was given an ocean view. It was on the 19th floor facing north. From what could tell, there are at least 2 different floor plans for the 2 bedroom units. Ours on the side of the building had views from both bedrooms as well as the living room. The units facing the ocean are different. Their 2nd bedroom faces the hallway. The advantage to those however is that they are lock off units. They have 2 kitchens and 2 living rooms, so that is the trade off. There is a building on the north side that might be about 12 floors high. Had we been below that, our view would have been blocked, but there would still be a sideways view of the ocean. Our room was spotless. The furnishings, carpeting, and appliances were all in great newer looking condition. The bathrooms were huge, the bedrooms large. The balcony was probably about 5' x 18'. They provide you with basic essentials for bathroom and kitchen. It also has a stack washer/dryer. You do have to wash your own bath towels and beach towels, so just plan for that. The resort is beautiful. The pools are great with lazy river and water slide. There are 2 indoor pools and an arcade for kids. There is also a water park across the street and a small amusement park a block away right on the beach. I don't have children, but think it would be a great place to stay with kids. The resort doesn't provide chaise lounges on the beach. Another company rents them out. For 2 chaises and umbrella it was $30 a day. We bought our own and Publix down the street and just left them behind. Much cheaper that way. There are very nice chaises by the pool however. I read other reviews that those are hard to get sometimes. But, that tends to be the case at many resorts or cruise ships for that matter that I have been in. Parking was not an issue.

There were several other elderly guests besides us who would have enjoyed using these chairs during their prolonged, unthoughtful absence by giving consideration for others. There was not one personnel employee checking on this matter,which reflects poor courtesy to paying guests.One more tip to guests,do not park your vehicle under the edge of any balcony on the top level- when it came time to go to our vehicle,we had a surprise of our life . Someone had consumed too much to drink and eat decided the best way to alleviate his problem was to hang over the balcony and let it go,,down to the roof of our van,side windows, door handles,rear window and rear bumper.Which was dried on pretty good.

To begin on a positive note, the general hotel grounds and amenities are well cared for and we thoroughly enjoyed the two indoor pools, the outdoor heated pool, the hot tub (spa) and the waterslide. Although during our trip the weather was cold and windy we were able to swim in the outdoor pool that had the waterslide as it was heated to an agreeable temperature. The outdoor lazy river was not heated (I am told it is very hard to heat moving water and keep it heated so this is understandable) and we did not use it. Also, the kids area was not heated so my children played in the pool. The pools were open until midnight (YAY!) which we took advantage of by swimming on our arrival evening late with our two children. The pools were never crowded, although if you wanted a lounge chair in the sun you had better get out and reserve your chairs early. The indoor pools were also very nice, uncrowded and heated to a slightly cool temperature that was still comfortable for swimming. After returning to the lounge one evening we found that they were doing Karaoke in the bar/lounge area that is part of the lobby. The activity director approached us and asked my seven year old if she would like to sing. My daughter loves nothing more than to entertain so she took him up on his offer and he managed the crowd and her singing with care to make sure none of the \u2018rowdier\u2019 guests got out of control while she was singing (not really much of a threat since it was a pretty sedate group, but I was happy that he did it anyway. It was a positive experience for us and very memorable. We were very happy he approached us because we never would have thought to do it otherwise. The hotel staff was all very friendly and helpful. We did need to ask for some extra dishes/silverware and had a running toilet that needed fixed and all of these were given prompt attention. We found the location of the hotel to be very convenient. I think they push that being close to the Ocean Walk Shoppes is a great advantage of the resort, but really we found the shops and dining to be passable and used them more for the convenience of location rather than because they offered superior product or great value. Now for the negative: the room. We booked a one bedroom which is usually plenty of room to accommodate my husband, two small children and myself. The room did have a lot of space, but really lacked any thoughtfulness to the design. We really had no place to put any of our stuff away which meant everything was out in the open and we were tripping over it during our stay. Even something like this can be overlooked if the rooms in general are in good condition. Ours was not. We only had two cups and two spoons in our kitchen for four people (we called and we were given more), there was no dishtowel or anything of the sort and really when they say in their description that there is a mini kitchen they are not kidding, there was barely room for one person to turn around. There was no dining table in the room, just a small expanded area of the kitchen counter with four tall chairs around it (not appropriate for small children if you ask me). If people are sitting at the counter while you are prepping a meal your counter space is significantly reduced. Our microwave door was duct taped because the bottom section by the handle was broken, the burners on the stove were not attached and the burners would not work (this was easily fixed by my husband who is very handy, but I never would have been able to fix it on my own) the fridge door handle was very dirty and it looked like someone tried to paint the fridge and the paint ran and it was never corrected. The dishwasher barely accommodated the breakfast and lunch dishes from my family of four and we had to run it twice a day (I recommend bringing some extra dishwashing detergent). No big deal to run it twice a day, except it was really very loud. The appointments in the living area were old and outdated and appeared to be unclean. We found an old moldy tomato on the floor and gum stuck to the bottom of the counter (actually my five year old found them). While we didn\u2019t use the pull out sofa sleeper, it looked to be broken and was desperately sagging in the middle. The real problem was the bathroom. The mirror was so old that the corners were wearing and had no reflective value to them. There was black mold inside the handle on the shower and along the wall in the grout around the edge. There was no way I would allow my children to take a bath so showers it was for all. The shower curtain was just a curtain made of some silky material (no liner) that a) barely reached the top of the tub and b) was made of such a light material that when the warm water was on it created a draft which made the curtain blow in and stick to you while you were in the shower (and this was gross because that too was moldy). The toilet and sink top appeared clean. The layout of the bathroom was not well thought out. The door from the bedroom and the door from the hallway both opened in and took up most of the usable space in the bathroom. There was only one towel rack which was hung over the back of the toilet. Not only was this not enough space to hang wet suits and beach and bath towels, but if you drop anything off of there and the lid is not closed on the toilet it is heading right in! The beds were average and the pillows somewhat uncomfortable and hard. The TV in the bedroom was laughably small and there was an odd window to the HALLWAY in the bedroom?!!! The air conditioning unit was in the hallway closet and was really loud. If you have trouble sleeping with loud noises (it would circulate on and off so it was not steady and we found it disturbing whether you were in the bedroom or the kitchen/living area). We were on the eighteenth floor and the balcony was very nice and the view from it was excellent. The screen door to the balcony was broken so we really couldn\u2019t leave the door open. The layout of the room was absolutely nothing like the layout they have on their website. The kicker was we went on a tour for the timeshare. The room they showed us as a sample room was beautiful. Immaculate, updated and clean, it really only made me angry that I was paying for the junky room I had and at the same rate as the rooms in the north tower. I questioned our salesperson who assured me that only the rooms in the south tower were old, that Wyndham actually owned the rooms in the north tower while they only managed the rooms in the south tower and had less control over the condition. Really I was appalled that they (Wyndham) would put their name on something so trashy and then ask us if we wanted to invest a large sum of money with them to stay at their properties regularly. If the rooms in the north tower were all really that nice then Wyndham should be ashamed for renting rooms in the south tower for the same rate and it should be advertised as a \u2018lesser\u2019 selection. If the rooms in the north tower were not that nice, then shame on Wyndham for being so misleading in their sales pitch! We did ask to be shown another room and were told that there were none available (I kinda doubt that since it was the first week in February). All of this was such a shame since all the common areas were well maintained and the resort location was so convenient. The only reason we didn\u2019t leave was because we were not in the room very often and spent most of our time in these common areas or out and about in the Daytona area. Sorry Wyndham, you won\u2019t be getting any recommendations from me and I surely will not be staying at any of your properties any time soon. I can handle a room that needs a little updating, but I cannot handle dirty to the point of disgusting along with dishonest business practices.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carberry, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Holiday\u201d", "Author": "bmcdon", "ReviewID": "UR124666775", "Content": "We spent 3 weeks at Ocean Walk in 3 different condos and Fully agree with ED S and his comments.

Most of the nice hotels were all booked up, but my mom managed to find us a room overlooking the ocean at the Wyndham Ocean Walk hotel. We\u2019d never stayed in a hotel like the Wyndham, so I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. The best word to describe the Wyndham hotel was massive. I love staying in luxurious places that have many amenities and lots of things to keep me busy. Wyndham easily met my expectations. It was about thirty stories high, and the building was a lot of different colors in the front. It was definitely an eye catcher, even considering the fact that it\u2019s located in the busiest part of Daytona. The lobby\u2019s floors shined and the pillars that supported the ceiling were striped with vibrant blues and greens. If you walked out the back door towards the ocean you were met with two huge pools, two hot tubs, a water slide, an enormous blow-up slide, a snack stand, and the beautiful beach. You could rent umbrellas and lounge chairs down on the beach if you wanted to have some shade from the sun while you spent the day outside. If you walked out of the hotel and turned right there was a theater, shopping center, restaurants, a live band, and more. People were constantly out enjoying the sites and activities. There was even a carnival with rides down the strip if you walked far enough! There was never a moment during my stay at Wyndham that was dull. When the weather was nice my family and I would enjoy the pools, beach, and other things that Wyndham\u2019s resort offered. On the few days it rained in Daytona the inside of the hotel had plenty of activities to keep us busy too. There was a movie box where you could rent a movie to watch for the night, a game center, indoor pools, hot tubs, restaurants, golf, a workout room, and much more! The people that worked there were friendly and helpful; they knew how to make you feel welcome. The week I spent at Daytona Beach was easily one of the most relaxing and enjoyable weeks I\u2019d had in a long time. The stress disappeared as soon as I laid eyes on the ocean and the exciting things to do at the hotel. Being at the beach always brings out my best attitude, and Wyndham made it ten times better. If you want a family friendly vacation then Wyndham Ocean Walk would be perfect for you. My family thoroughly enjoyed it, although the weather certainly could\u2019ve been a little better. Going in the summertime might be better than the spring time; that way there would be almost no doubt that it\u2019d be warm and sunny. Have a fun vacation!

We had three separate families travelling together; we had an room next to my brother and his family, and my parents had a room with a view of the ocean, on the same floor. All of the rooms were very nice; we had a small diswasher malfunction when we entered our room, and maintenance came very quickly and fixed it immediately. They were friendly and apologetic for the inconvenience, we didn't have any additional issues during our stay. Check in was normal; not the fastest part of the trip but not unpleasant. They did ask us if we wanted to take the timeshare tour, and we declined; they were not unfriendly afterwards. My only complaint, in general, is when we tried to obtain more laundry soap, it took us two days. The front desk directed us to the concierge, who directed us to Housekeeping. Left the message with Housekeeping, who said they would bring it but did not. Called again and they told us to go to the front desk. Different front desk person sent us elsewhere - anyway, it was just laundry soap, not a big deal, but a little frustrating. The facilities were very nice - a couple of pools, hot tub, water slide, etc. They had activities for those who wanted to participate. I appreciated that they had an Under 18 computer room, and an Adults Only computer room - I did need to do a little work while travelling ,and with no wifi in the rooms and logged in on my computer in the Adults room. It was quiet and comfortable. I did notice, however, that of the three computers at the public computer bank, only one would print, and one of the others wouldn't connect to something. There was some frustration from those using those particular computers that they couldn't do what they needed due to those issues, or had to wait for the computer that did have everything working. I also noticed that people did have to wait to use a computer, although when I was there it generally wasn't too long - probably 15 minutes at the most. It seemed the guests using the computers did realize there was a line and took care of their business quickly when necessary. The beach in front of the resort is very nice; there is a very long stretch of beach to enjoy, so while it gets busy there's plenty of space. It DOES, however, get busy. The pools at the hotel also get extremely busy - it's hard to get a deck chair, and there are always a lot of people coming and going. We enjoyed being so close to Ocean Walk, as we did walk over and eat at several establishments over there. We're not big race fans, so we didn't spend any time in Daytona at those establishments. We spent most of our time just relaxing at the beach, and had a very nice time.

We are Worldmark owners and booked a 3-night stay here as our first visit to Daytona Beach. We used it as a home base to visit St. Augustine about an hour north. However, the resort needs maintenance and the service needs an upgrade! It gets 3 stars simply for its good location. There is no Worldmark check-in desk, so even if you\u2019re an owner, you\u2019ll stand in line with everyone else who booked this resort online or via a travel agent. When I went to a side desk near the front desk to inquire about check-in, the person (Patti Richardson was her name) looked very angry and unhappy and said, \u201cThis desk is only for VIPs.\u201d I asked, \u201cI\u2019m a Worldmark owner. How do I know if I\u2019m a VIP?\u201d She said, \u201cIf you were a VIP, you\u2019d know. You can stand in line with the others.\u201d I don\u2019t mind receiving an answer I don\u2019t want to hear, but she could have cracked a smile. Looking back though, not only was she rude, but I am increasingly shocked that there was no check-in line for owners. Our wait in line was 25 minutes on a Friday night at 9pm. Not what we expected, and not a big deal on its own, but read on. Now for the room itself -- It was spacious, and I bet when the resort was new, it was probably a really nice space! All of the rooms were HUGE! The view was of the parking rooftop, and some of the city of Daytona, but it is what it is and I won\u2019t fault the resort for the poor view. What I DO fault the resort for is the poor maintenance and the fact that our room wasn\u2019t ready even after 9pm \u2013 - We were in room 1131. The kitchen was not stocked with any coffee, though the coffee filters, sugar, Splenda and creamer were in full supply. My husband went to the front desk on our second morning to pick up the coffee. He should not have needed to do that. The kitchen should have been stocked prior to our arrival. - The bathroom had no little bottles of lotion, shampoo, or anything at all. We were only supplied with two bars of soap. On Day 2, we went to the hallway, found a cart, and picked up the items we needed. This should not have happened. -The inside door handle to the shower was missing. Imagine stepping into a shower, and there is no way to shut the door. That\u2019s what we had to deal with every morning. Additionally, the plug was missing at the bottom of the shower door to prevent water from leaking all over the floor. So, after each shower, water dripped all over the floor from the bottom of the door. -The door stop opposite the front door was broken. It was literally just hanging on the wall with broken wood around it. -The garbage disposal in the kitchen was missing the rubber protector which meant when you looked into the drain, you could see the disposal. When we DID use the disposal, a red piece of plastic shot out of the disposal because that protector was missing. -On our final morning, we decided to take one last dip in the hot tub as we\u2019d done a couple of mornings before. However, none of the three hot tubs were working. Two were turned off and the water was lukewarm. The third hot tub was roped off. Another disappointment. -The kicker was when I went to take my final shower on our last morning and all four of the electrical outlets in the two bathrooms stopped working. The GFI buttons on the outlets were in the correct position, so we\u2019re not sure what happened. It was likely a problem with a fuse or the breaker, neither of which we had access to. My husband notified a maintenance worker in the hallway so he could address it, but I was completely undressed since I had just showered. To put a \u201cband aid\u201d on the situation, my husband moved the dresser in the bedroom to gain access to an outlet with a mirror so I could dry my hair and finish getting dressed. Our stay here included a comedy of errors from start to finish at this resort. We have never missed a maintenance fee payment in the 15 years we have owned Worldmark, and were disappointed in the apparent lack of maintenance and courtesy at this resort.

It went way down hill and has since been on somewhat of a rise over the last 5 or 10 years. That being said, it is still a bit on the rough side. This resort and the restaurants & shops attached to it make all of that much more tolerable. I would not put Daytona anywhere near the top of my choices though for a family vacation. Because of the good security and facilites on site, we were looking forward to a nice relaxing 3 days of mid 70 degree weather by the pool and beach, enjoying the property. Well the weather held up and the staff were quite friendly. The room was not ready even minutes prior to 4pm, and in all fairness check-in was 4pm and we got our room at 4pm. The 3 main pools out back were not what we expected. The two outer pools were maybe mid 70's, but nowhere near a pleasant temperature. The center pool which is the lazy river may have had ice cubes in it. I had stared at the photo of the lazy river several times prior to this trip and was very dissapointed it was not heated. The tiki bar (called something else) does not even open again until February! The beach was as great as always! The room was a one bedroom which is what we booked. The bedroom portion was adjacent to the elevators and noisy. The bedroom window looked out to the hallway and elevator and had horizontal blinds with decorative side curtains that did not move. So at night, if you like a dark room and quiet, you will get neither. The flatscreen on the wall was comical. If I can figure out how I will post a picture of it. It must have been a 19\"-20\" or so. It looked more like a laptop mounted to the wall. The main living room was spacious and had a very large flatscreen TV. The entire room was clean. It did not however smell clean or fresh in any way (more like the waffle house). The handle to the sliding glass door was broken off and laid with the remote controls like it belonged there. There was a full ktichen that we never used, but appeared to have whatever you neeeded. The location has a large 3 story small mall of sorts with shops and restaurants adjacent and attached to it. Opposite the shop area was a Hilton that looked pretty nice. I know it used to be Adams Mark back in the day. I have not stayed at that facility (Hilton) but would look into it if I decide to return.

There is no question that it is probably the nicest timeshare on the beach but it is handled differently than the other Wyndham resorts. Many of the units have full-time owners who rent them out so there are not only timeshares but daily rentals, and also in the AAA book as hotel rooms. So there always seems to be a question about our reservation. The timeshare is, of course, a great deal for us, especially compared to the nightly rate. We have enjoyed very much the nightly stays available through the Wyndham points system. We have stayed there many times, most recently December 2010 and will stay again in January 2012. We have only been able to get to the front desk once when calling in advance and I always want to call in advance to verify our reservation, especially since they also have had, more than once, problems verifying our reservation once we were there. They only want you to call the regular Wyndham 800-number which is of no help for confirming our reservation onsite. There is also a long wait time on that line. Front desk people have not been very friendly. VIP desk seems to be no more with no early check in\u2019s and when it used to be in operation, we had to wait until after 5 p.m. more than once for our room to be ready. One time, when we had back to back reservations, which they assured us were fine; then security came to our door at 11 am. demanding that we leave immediately I had to rush downstairs to verify our dates, which of course, I had already verified upon check-in. A front desk person had assured us it was fine. Like I said, there always seems to be a \u201cquestion\u201d about our reservation. One reviewer has said as exchangers, they felt like a second class citizen. Well, don\u2019t feel so bad, owners are treated that way too. In that case, I don\u2019t know who would get a nice front desk clerk. Check out usually requires a long wait in line as well (while we are sweating out the 10 a.m. or else check-out deadline!) There is also always something in the room needing to be fixed, the most common the televisions. They are missing remotes, missing the electric wire, cable connections are twisted or actually broken off, and twice were not even hooked up to any wires; so now we know to check them right away since at midnight, when going to bed, when we find there is no television in the bedroom, it is not the time to call and wait for maintenance. Shower doors off rails, toilet seats broken, no kitchen wastebasket, dryer won\u2019t turn off \u2026lots of maintenance problems which may or may not get fixed the next day. One time, right after the Fairfield name was changed to Wyndham, there was no bedspread on the bed. The bedroom looked so strange; it actually took me a while to realize that the blanket was on top with the mattress showing below. I called to ask for one 3 days in a row, I guess they couldn\u2019t believe it either. Finally I asked if this was the new \u201cWyndham decorating system\u201d\u2026well, I don\u2019t think they \u201cgot\u201d it \u2013 but they brought a bedspread then! Most recently, the front desk person was not interested in any of our maintenance notes until we told him about the roaches we found. He perked up then! Apparently, they have changed the pool towels procedure from before, but it is still not ideal. They will charge you $15 each for not returning the pool towels but when you return them to the special office downstairs, the lady just says, \u201cThanks, just throw them out on the pile there in the hall. Goodbye.\u201d Well, I wanted some sort of receipt to prove that they had taken out the carbon copy of my name from their file, but she said No, could not get one, didn\u2019t need one. That makes me nervous. This to say that I am usually very happy even with non 5- star resorts, so this one seems so strange since as an obvious gorgeous 5 star resort, there always is an issue. Nevertheless, it is a beautiful resort, oceanfront, and art deco d\u00e9cor that will knock you over.

The pools are great, especially if traveling with children. Great splash zone for the little ones. Lazy river is also a plus. For Daytona, you probably will not find a better selection of pools/water options. Cons-The rooms are dated and need remodeling. If you are a room person, this may not be the place. Also, we went with our family and a set of grandparents. We reserved a one bd rm king and the GPs also reserved a separate one bedrm king. We checked in at different times and both of us were given a one bedrm w two queens. We both had a little bit of a hassle actually getting the rooms w kings. Other guests said that, regardless of what you reserve, you don't get a king one bedrm unless you insist on it at check-in. Also- in our one bedrm, we had 4 towels for 4 people and one travel bar of soap for a 6 day stay. Yes, they have washer/driver, but when 4 people are at the beach all day and no one stays in and does laundry, you need at least 6 towels. Also, one travel soap is not sufficient. I asked for extra towels and one extra bar of soap and the front management said no. I had to make a special request to a supervisor- something about my condo was owned by another company or individually owned and they would not provide additional towels or an extra bar of soap. Really? This soap request had to be elevated to the next level- not kidding. Take home message: nice pools, but do not expect the full Wyndham experience as far as rooms or service. But, it is one of the nicer options in Daytona (we had other family obligations right outside of daytona and combined it w a beach trip, or we would have probably picked a different beach location altogether).", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cSeen better\u201d", "Author": "Alex P", "ReviewID": "UR119352331", "Content": "Slide was closed and pool deck was under renovation and they said nothing about it when we made the reservation.

We contacted the guest services staff who indicated that because it was after 5pm (it was approximately 6pm) they couldn't do anything about that because \"maintenance handles those things and they are finished at 5 and lock-up their things in a separate building.\" We asserted that our daughter had no place to sleep and they responded that there was nothing they could do. This was unacceptable. I drove back to guest services and calmly asserted that point. The manager maintained that she could help us in the morning until a man emerged from the back and said he would try to borrow a set of bedding from another unit. He returned with a bag of sheets and no apology. By then it was well past my daughter's bedtime and I returned to our condo to make her bed. When I arrived my husband said another bag of sheets had just been dropped off. Not a great first impression of the Wyndham idea of guest relations.

By what I've heard, the check in in the afternoon is a nightmare. We had to get a cart to take our luggage upstairs. I had to surrender my drivers license to use it. We were on the 24th floor in the North Tower with city views/river views/ocean views which was beautiful. We rented from an owner so the room was very nice and updated. The bathroom was huge. So much room that we could not have been any more comfortable. It was just myself,husband,& baby. I pulled off the comforter from the bed because I don't care where you are at , I swear they NEVER wash them. Well underneath was the other blanket that was brown. Well glad I pulled that one off because I could see where something dried on it. It could have been bodily fluids for all I know....GROSS!!! Luckily I brought my own blanket to put on top of the sheets. The kitchen had everything you would need except the ice maker did not work!!!! That was a major downer. You should wear a pool band while in the pool areas, however I never wore mine & I was never questioned about it. The security does stand around the pool areas. The indoor pool in my opinion was not comfortable. It should have been warmer. We arrived on a Tuesday night and it was so peaceful. The elevators were quick. There were plenty of parking and no lines anywhere. We could find a beach chair at 11:00 in the AM. I say that to say this....by Friday when everyone showed up things we complete madness. You will enjoy this hotel if you can go during the week in the off season and not in June/July. We left a day early because the amount of people was crazy. We went out one morning and had to go to the beach because they had no pool chairs. The elevators were very slow with all the people coming and going. One of the problems came when I got on the elevator only to discover that a boy and his 2 freinds had pushed like 5 other floors randomly thinking it was funny. AND THERE PARENTS WERE NO WHERE TO BE FOUND!!! We did enjoy all of the pools and the lazy river was clean blue and enjoyable ! We would stay here again if it is not Labor Day weekend, or a weekend in general. We would come back during the week. That is when you can really enjoy the facilities and get your money's worth ! I also had to get my key card reactivated 2 times. The front desk was very nice and helpful and it only took a second. The second time I called from the floor and they sent up a security officer to let me in. He was very polite and helpful. Then an engineer came to fix our door...it may have been messing up the key cards or something. One last beef.....we forgot the pack n play for my baby to sleep in. Well the front desk said they were out for the night and for me to call back in the AM. When I called the next day, a man told me that since I am staying in a room from an owner that I am not allowed to use the pack n plays at the resort. I WAS LIVID!!!!!! A stay at the hotel is a stay at the hotel or so I thought. So I had to make a run to Walmart to buy a cheap one that I could take back later !!!! We should be allowed to use anything there !!!!!!!

The 1-bdrm suite does not come with an outside view, so nice for just add'l sleeping and dressing space (that's basically what we used it for). The furniture and appliance were modern enough but the flooring throughout needed a change. Great breakfast at the cafe there in the resort and not too costly. The main pier was closed for construction so that was disappointing. I was surprised how clean this beach was considering it is a very popular beach and cars are allowed in certain areas. The umbrella and chair rentals at the beach can become costly if you are staying for a while so budget for that expense ($25 p/d). There are many small shops throughout and area the resort making it easy to get things. Those who like to shop there is a mall and bigger shopping centers nearby, but you will need to drive. The staff was nice and friendly and very accommodating to our needs. We requested more towels and got without a problem. And the hall light bulb blew so we call to ask them to change it, left the room when we return few hours later it had been changed.

The staff at the desk didn't seem very friendly, much information (that was somewhat unnessesary) was required at check-in. After receiving a room number and key, we were then required to go to another person (across the room), who welcomed us and informed us they could help us extend our check out time on our day of departure (originally we had been informed it would be 10:00AM) to 2:00PM. Their main purpose, it turned out, was to encourage us to attend a breakfast scheduled for Monday morning. When I inquired if this was to solicit us for a time share, the lady was very evasive, and assured us there would be no \"pressure\". We then proceded to our room, and our immediate reaction was disappointment. There was no ocean view (we had reserved a one bedroom), the pictures on the website were in no way representative of what we got. When I went into the bedroom, the venetian blinds were broken (at the top and bottom) where anyone walking past could see into the room. I called the operator (dialing zero) and the person was not helpful, and was in fact rude. She ask if I wanted to speak to the supervisor and I told her that in fact I did. The supervisor's reccomendation was that I hang a blanket over the window. When I informed her that I did not \"hang blankets over windows at home\" and I had no intention of doing so here. I told her I did not pay over $1000 dollars to hang blankets over the window. She ask if I wanted to change rooms, I informed her yes I did. She stated there would be a \"room cleaning\" charge (remember I hadn't been here ten minutes yet). I questioned this, and she stated it was \"policy\". Then she switched and told me they were full up and there were no rooms available. The maintenance person, to his credit, found??? a new blind about two hours later and installed it. In addition we discovered; the can opener did not work, the phone in the bedroom did not work, the remote control to the living room TV did not work. I called again and was informed they would be fixed, they never were. I called back later, and they informed all had been repaired (they weren't) we had never even left the room. Finally, we retired for the evening resolved to make the best of it. The light that came into the room the whole night was like daylight there were no curtains only the blinds and the light from the bright lights in the hall could not be stopped (I guess we could have hung a blanket over the window). In the morning we were both very sore as the mattress was as hard as a rock (I now suspect we were indeed sleeping on the boxspring without a real mattress). I say this because on the day we checked out I discovered the edges were made of metal, I never removed the sheets to check, it was later that I wondered if it was indeed the boxspring. My wife had to sleep on the couch in the living room the last four nights as her pain just kept getting worse. The pool was good, the ocean great and Daytona and surrounding area wonderful, but I would never stay at Ocean Walk again.

My family had lots of fun going to the well maintained beach, the boardwalk, the shops right next door and across the street, and most of all, the lazy river.

The pools are as clean as they can be at a resort which is right on the beach and the staff do what they can to keep it clean.

We agreed and went to the presenation. It was for a vacation club time share. We were bombarded with slide shows, talks, a tour of a room like we had just stayed in only cleaner. Then presented with a deal to buy into a time share for around $30,000.00 when we turned that one down the dog and pony show started. As typical the first person trying to sell us acted like he really didnt understand everything so the MANAGER had to step in and help. We were then hit with 4 more deals that finally went from $30,000.00 to $9,000.00. When those were refused a third person was brought in. He act more sternly with us than the first two. He presented us with a buy in at $2800.00. When we refused he acted some what upset. Finally we were able to get the items promised after 4 hours. I do not know if I will return to Wyndam or not?", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange Park, Florida", "Title": "\u201cThis place stinks!

Room wasnt ready by 4pm even though that is the check in time. Had to wait in three lines and after two and a half hours my room was still not ready. Finally given another room on the 16th floor of the south tower. Room smelled horribly. Squished bugs on the walls and ceiling, about 20 of them. Bathroom looks to be 20 years old and never renovated with mold around the tub and the faucet dripping. The oven knob was broken and the temp was not right and burned stuff. Another knob for the stove was missing. The phone barely worked. When I called down to report the squished bugs it kept cutting out when I moved and talked at the same time. After returning around 5pm the 2nd day the bugs were still there. I went down to the desk and asked for a new room. They said someone would be up right away to clean them. No apologies. They did clean them up that evening. The place was crawling with hundreds of unsupervised teenagers. People get in line at 7am to reserve a place at the pool by putting towels down on the chairs then dont return for 2-3 hours. One day all the pool/beach towels were out by 11am and they said they would not have any more for the rest of the day. The lazy river is supposed to be limited to 30 persons but one night I counted more than 60 in there. Parking is a pain and if you have more then one car you are out of luck.

For those that have 2 and 3 families staying in one unit, they have to pay for parking in the public parking garage. For as much as it cost to stay at Oceanwalk, you shouldn't have to pay for parking. There should be some arrangements made with public parking at no cost to the Oceanwalk residents or some other form of parking available. There should be more tables by the pool with umbrellas instead of up on the patio where the doors are to the hotel.

They do try to accomodate in such a positive manor. I did attend the presentation on the vacation rentals and Aaron was awesome, even though I could not purchase at this time. I attended one when Oceanwalk was a Fairfield resort and was very pressured to purchase. You can not ask for a more centrally located spot with alot to do .

In order to be fair and clear I will begin at the beginning...We rented for an individual owner who was very nice to deal with...the room we rented was a King Bedroom with a lock-out ... the layout was wonderful and there was an abundance of space for the 5 of us! We arrived approx 6pm on the day of check-in...The line was jaw-dropping, at least a 45 minute wait to speak with one of the three desk clerks. As we had rented all of our units from the same owner, we had pre-paid our rental fee, cleaning fee, & security deposit and signed a complete short term rental agreement. When we reached the counter, the clerk asked for another $150.00 cc hold/deposit...now we are talking $450.00 in deposit...when I asked about the deposit I was told... the larger deposit is for the property owner and the $150.00 for resort incidentals. Should have been a red flag but I didn't catch it...I was also presented with a resort contract, requiring my signature. The problem with this was the contradictions with the original rental contract. Check-out time, which is enforced with a financial penalty was different, the parking (which I will address later) was different...and when I asked for a copy of this document that was not their policy. All checked in and ready to proceed to our room, we learned there is only one bellhop on-duty and only 4 luggage carts...it was suggested by the desk clerk that we \"just wait until around 10pm and then try to get a cart\". The 5 of us proceeded to our 10th floor unit while the 4 others made their way to the 9th floor. On our route we found an unattended luggage cart sitting in the elevator hallway. Of course we grabbed it, telephoned the other members of our group and made tracks to the parking garage to retrieve our luggage, deposited it the rooms and returned the cart to the main lobby. Our unit (with lock-out) included two full baths...after 11 hours in our vehicle, we all wanted hot showers and dinner. Surprise! No hot water in the South Tower, response from front desk \"They are working on it - Should be several more hours\". When we returned from Dinner, around 10pm, we had warm water and virtually no pressure, which continued for throughout the trip. Rinsing my hair was a lesson in determination, it took forever, the pressure would barely rinse the soap from your body. The outdoor pool areas were like nothing I have ever seen or experienced...The South Tower pool, hot tub and lazy river were dirty with a scuzzy film floating in the water and in great disrepair. The North Tower pool was much cleaner. I did not utilize the Kid's Water Play area, so I can't comment on the condition. The Turtle's Nest Tiki Bar opened around 11am and closed between 2:30 and 4:00pm...I would think the hours would line up, more closely, with the pool hours, which were posted as 8:15 to midnight. On our first morning, our group was perplexed by the line of people we observed forming on the sidewalk, beginning at around 7am. Imagine our surprise as we watched the uniformed security guards (south tower) and resort-attired personnel (north tower) begin to appear. At 8am...the guards/personnel stepped up, announced his wish that everyone should \"Have A Great Day\" to which those gathered on the sidewalk and steps responded by jumping barrier chains and bolting to chairs and tables. Often arguments and disagreements followed, which the personnel of either were unwilling to mediate. So, if you want a chair or table on the pool deck, plan to show up around 7am, get yourself in line and then behave like an NFL front lineman to claim a spot. This happens every morning, without fail. We fondly referred to this process as \"The running of the Bulls\". If you don't mind afternoon pool activity in the shade, you can show up around 2:30pm, as those wishing to enjoy the sun begin to vacate the area due to the buildings shading the entire area from 2:30pm until dark. Over the course of our seven day stay we began to hear other guests grumbling and complaining about various issues. We were also able to gather a great deal of info about the issues. The front desk personnel were routinely hateful and prone to a \"pass the buck\" attitude. It was here that one explained to me that the South Tower Homeowners Association and the Wyndham Resort are engaged in a law suit, therefore the staff is there to service the North Tower and is unavailable for the South Tower Guests, with the exception of things which they choose to do (check-in). Which explains why the personnel is unable to cross the invisible line on the sidewalk, answer questions, provide assistance, or even conduct themselves in a professional manner. It was a nightmare...they even have segregated lost and found areas. (ie...if you are staying in So. Tower, lose an item, an No. Tower Guest finds said item, turns it in to the front desk, you must contact So. Tower Security, have their personnel agree to contact No. Tower Security to inquire and retrieve item (if found) and then hope that So. Tower Security (third party firm) returns item to you, the rightful owner. Parking...The property owner who I rented from was clear and adamant that parking would be provided for only one vehicle per unit...I understand, it is peak season and parking is at a premium. Imagine my surprise when we returned to the property on Wednesday evening (approx 10pm) following dinner and were greeted by \"Garage Full\" Signs. The attendant said we should obtain an additional pass from the front desk. Clerk informed me that the on-site garages were full, gave me a 12 hour voucher for the public garage across the street, stating they can only park 90% of occupants and if I wish to park on-site I need to have my vehicle in the garage by 7pm. Along with a stern lecture that the car should be moved in a timely manner as they would not be responsible for additional fees, outside the 12 hours. The homeowner, from whom we rented, was very clear...One Pass for On-Site Parking...When we retrieved our vehicle at 8:30am, the following morning, there was a nasty note on the windshield about overnight parking and a chalk time written in the corner of the front windshield. It is our family tradition to rent scooters for one 24 hour period while vacationing in Daytona Beach. This has never been a problem, the other resorts allow you to park these very small vehicles in an out of the way corner of the garage without issue or conflict...NOT SO AT OCEAN WALK! We even offered to park them in the same spot with our vehicle...which was more than possible given the vehicle size...The response was if you do that we will tow one or both vehicles. We returned the rented vehicle and thanks to Julie we were able to amend our rental agreement and avoid a total loss of prepaid fees. Thanks Julie! So are ya keeping up so far,..In-line for pool chair no later than 7am...Vehicle in the garage by 7pm...No parking of Fun Rentals. The bottom line is this...This facility could be top-notch but they are far from that...Divisiveness among the \"Powers-That-Be\" have created an unfriendly, almost hostile atmosphere ... What a shame! We are only a group of 9, but we won't be back...when I am on vacation the last thing I want is to be drawn into and effected by someone else's drama and conflict...No Thanks...I will return to a resort where it's all R & R!", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chattanooga", "Title": "\u201cAWESOME EXPERIENCE\u201d", "Author": "Daddy21", "ReviewID": "UR115504931", "Content": "Location, Location, Location!

He said to build family memories by putting your family in situations where you have to overcome adversities. He mentioned camping. I think this hotel qualifies in place of camping. After we checked in and mentioned to the people trying to sell us a timeshare how bad the rooms were, they told us the hotel is divided into two parts. The north tower and the upper part of the south tower are managed by Wyndham Resorts, and the first 12 floors of the south tower are managed by Wyndham Hotels. So you have a 30% chance of getting a really bad room. The resort rooms are periodically updated. The hotel rooms look very old. Resort rooms have granite granite countertops. Hotel rooms have Formica. Stains on the couch. Really bad stains on the curtains. The one thing that was recently updated was the washer. The hotel gives you one set of towels for the entire stay, so we were washing towels. The drain was not hooked up on the washer, so when it went to the spin cycle, it drained the water onto the carpet. Maintenance did come and get most of the water out, but it was still pretty wet. They didn't have fans to dry the carpet. They didn't offer to move us to another room. They told us to run the ceiling fan to dry it out. (Seriously, they actually told us that.) The carpet was still wet enough three days later that it would get our socks wet if we walked on the carpet without shoes. The window view reminded me of a motel. It looked out into the hallway and onto a rooftop. If you actually opened the curtains, you would have watched the people walk by your room (and they would have watched you in your room). The hall way smelled like urine, especially in the afternoon when the sun was shining in on it. (I guess that's like camping too, just go behind a tree.) No free internet in the rooms, but they do have it in the lobby area. Dave Ramsey says to avoid the time share traps. Instead, pay a little more and enjoy your vacation. Unfortunately, we followed Glenn Frey's financial advice, \"It's the lure of easy money, it's got a very strong appeal.\" My advice if you do take the bait is to review the timeshare users group forum before you go. Some very good advice on that website. Bottom line, if you do buy, buy on the secondary market and don't borrow money to do it. Anything positive? The lobby area was nice. Pool and beach were good.

The Good- The hotel has nice finishes and the room we stayed in was clean, well designed and fairly up to date. I liked that it had a small kithcen as opposed to just being a hotle room. The pool is beautiful and there are lots of amenities such as beach towel service, kids activities, two indoor pools, a nice gym, snack bar at the pool, etc. Daytona also puts on a great fireworks display every friday night that you can see from your balcony. The BAD- Its a timeshare and they will pressure you to buy a timeshare. They will run your check in credit card info to access your credit report and then offer you financing for the timeshare. Thinking of buiying a time share? Ask a realtor if thery really are a \"great investment\". I am very much opposed to buying them, but I love to rent from teh people that do own them. But back to the review.... Also, be preparred for a horrible check-in experience. Lines and waiting. Other Guests- There were a lot of other guests. The pool and lazy river were so crowded that it made me not want to get in. This was likely due to us going at the most busy time of year- Im sure its probably not as crowded in the fall/winter. There were way more smokers than I am used to. I have a new baby, so I was not happy to be surrounded by smokers in the pool area. Daytona seems to be trying to move past thier \"bike week\" reputaiton and attract more families throught the year. The guests at the hotel were representative of this transition. It was not uncommon to see guests in the elevators with open containers in the evening, but no one seemed to be overindulging or acting in an offensive manner. TIPS= -If you book via a \"third party\" like orbitz or kayak or hotels.com be sure to confirm your reservation. There was a \"glitch\" in our reservation and if I had not called to confirm we would have gotten there and not had a room -They say check-in is at 4, but the earlier you arrive the better and more likely you are to recieve the oceanfront you booked. You can \"pre-check in\" any time and then show you your ID in ANOTHER line after 4 to get your room key. I suggest waiting until 5 to get the key so the line dies down. -When returning from the pool/beach, go down to the lower level and get on the elevators at the LL level. You will skip the wait on the main lobby level and not have to parade the lobby in your swim suit.

We loved Bonnet Creek and Glacier Canyon so we knew we were going to enjoy Ocean Walk.....wrong! Our ocean view room was given away since we did not flag it a \"do not move.\" No where was that stated on their page. So we were upset about that. Then we were suppose to check in as VIP's and their VIP counter was not staffed (we learned later from several staff members that they were understaffed). We went to our room and everything at that point looked great. After a day on the beach and receiving wrong directions from a guest service representative to the local Walmart, we decided to seek out their out door bar by the pools and ocean. It was closed at 3pm due to understaffing (a staff member pointed this out). Then we decided to walk on the beach and go to dinner. When returning to the hotel room at 9:30ish we turned back the covers to find clear sticky stuff all over the sheets. I called housekeeping for a new set. It took over an hour and a half for them to arrive. My husband then decided to take a shower and the shower head was sitting on the soap dish in the shower stall and would not attach. A call to maintenance. Another hour + wait. My husband called to speak to a manger and the clerk said she would call right back. NOTHING. The next morning we went to seek out a manager. On the way we noticed a foul smell coming from the vending room. We think it was the sewer. The manager talked to us and did admit staff problems and wants to send us a two night stay on them for our problems. We will not be going back...why? Let me tell you....He had us go to a new room the next day. It was ocean view so we were happy until we saw the comforter which had a brown crusty matter on it....eeeewwww! Housekeeping brought us a blanket instead and took the comforter. Then at night I got up to go to the bathroom and found roaches everywhere. I also checked the kitchen...roaches. We researched them when we got home and they look like German Roaches. I frantically called a manager in the morning. She said she would move us AGAIN and would have someone write or call corporate and we would get a copy of the letter. NOPE! Never received that. Also we caught two of the roaches and gave them to the manager. The next manager had us wait for our room and when we did move an exterminator was waiting for us to move our things out and so another day wasted. The last room was also an ocean view but by this time we did not care. All we wanted was to get out of there and to go home and toss our luggage so we did not bring home those roaches.

There are umbrellas and beach chairs available for rent for about $25 a day (umbrella and 2 chairs). The pool area is large and is well shaded in the afternoon by the building. There is a kiddie pool that will hold the tots' attention. The beach bar and grill has food for kids and adults with decent prices, but seating gets tough to find at lunch time so plan accordingly.

Admittedly, the first impression this time was not a particularly good one; the check-in lines were abnormally long-- even the VIP Express lane. To our disappointment, we were given only one parking pass; the other car in our party had to pay for overnight parking in a garage across the street, and the customer service associate didn't seem particularly helpful or sympathetic about the situation. The service manager did rectify the problem the next day, however. The hotel's location is right in the thick of things; it's right next door to the Ocean Walk Shoppes (with several \"upscale casual\" restaurants like Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.), and a short walk from the Boardwalk and the Pier. There is a Burger King, two pizza places, a Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks within a three-minute-walking radius. The only negative I can think of about the location is that the only way to exit the parking area is a right turn onto Atlantic Avenue (divided highway), so travelers must go down a couple of stoplights before making a U-turn, which is thankfully legal in Florida. Our room was a 3-bedroom suite, the largest type available at this facility. Except for the rather well-used couch, the interior was in good repair, and the bathrooms showed no sign of mold or mildew. The full kitchen is well-stocked with cookware; I recommend using it for breakfast and the occasional lunch, in order to save money versus the rather high prices in the on-site deli. A definite improvement from 2009 is the availability of free WiFi in the rooms. Don't get too excited; signal coverage is sometimes spotty and can vary from point to point inside the units, and speed is not particularly fast-- good enough for a Facebook status update or e-mail check, but video streaming is not feasible for extended viewing. Those of you who are worried about the pool's current state of repair because of recent reviews, worry no more. All pool facilities are now fully operational. I've included a photo of the \"lazy river\" and pool with waterslide; both were running just fine the entire time. There is a second full-size pool and gated kiddie splash area, which helped ensure that no pool was ever too crowded, even though this was during peak season. The pool deck could have used a couple dozen more chairs though; they were indeed in short supply. I marked the Sleep Quality down as \"average\". The beds are comfortable enough, but the fact that this is a high-rise facility virtually guarantees that another guest is above you, and is likely to have a different sleep pattern and/or occasionally rowdy children or teenagers.

I was really skeptical having read all of the reviews, but to my surprise it was one of the most relaxing vacations that we have taken. The check in was smooth, but that may have been due to the fact that we checked in on a Sunday. We were on the 9th floor in the North tower and the unit was beautiful with a breathtaking view! Most things are actually in the South tower, but easy to access. The elevators were very slow though, so you will have to be a little patient. My husband and I actually took the stairs a couple of times because we didn't want to wait, but they are not well labeled, so you may have to hunt. The parking garage was packed with vehicles, but we expected that. Each level of the garage is accessible to the elevators by going through a side door. Our unit was top notch. Our gift was given to us by people who own a timeshare through the Wyndham, so I wonder if that made a bit of a difference with the shape of the unit. The only complaint with the room that I had was a little mold around the shower head in the main room. Otherwise it was excellent from the view to the bed and its comfort! The bar is only open a little after 11pm, but the bartender in the evening was fabulous! The drinks were great and he sparked conversation with ease. I think his name was Micheal. The Turtle's Nest out by the pool is great too! They do start serving food at 11am, but stop around 4pm, yet drinks were available until around 6pm. The shops next door were handy and nice to access. We enojoyed walking down the boardwalk and taking it all in!! The Mai Tai Bar is next door and I believe they have happy after 7pm!!! We didn't go, but I am sure it is a deal. That is now my favorite drink!! So, please DO NOT go to Napoli pizza acrossed the street! They have horrible customer service and I think the sauce is actually tomato paste!! Restaurants in the area that I have to recommend are: Crabby Joe's-- Sunglow Pier! We ate there twice!! Excellent view and food! Oyster Pub-for yummy oysters and a sportslike atmosphere..be aware the drinks are Not strong...beer a better choice! Tailgators- Up A1A a bit from the Wyndham, Karoke Sunday nights and great food! You will be amazed at the Gator Bites appetizer. Ocean Deck- A short walk a way from the hotel and very popular! Great drinks and Great food!! Old City Pizza-Great oven brick pizza and they deliver to the lobby of the hotel!! Barnacles-Grouper like you have never had it! Ker's Wing House- Great salad and wings! They are different than we are used to the wings here in the Northeast. Bubba Gump Shrimp- great for lunch!! Sloppy Joe's- Also great for lunch The beach is 26 miles long and nobody can own a part of Daytona Beach!! This makes it quite accessible and really enjoyable if you want to go to a section where there isn't a lot of people! We drove almost to Ponce Inlet to find a nice area of the beach where we felt spaced out and could enjoy taking a nap and relaxing. I would recommend the Wyndham with or without Children....they have so many things for the kids to do it is impressive! We would really go back in a heartbeat!

Understandably, each room houses several hundred people per year so there are a few minor glitches but nothing like some of the poorly written reviews. The bugs everyone are talking about are called LOVE BUGS! We asked because they were everywhere (even in our room). Unfortunately, we were told they are seasonal and there nothing anyone is the state of Florida can really do about them. The love bugs don\u2019t bite but are annoying. We live in Chicago so we understood their frustration with the love bugs due to our experience with cicadas. The timeshare people did call us once. My boyfriend simply told them we were in town on vacation and he wasn\u2019t sure of our schedule. Needless to say, they didn\u2019t call again. We called guest services in need of a crib for our 15 month old and they brought one up in roughly 20 minutes (with clean linen). Your key is needed at all times to enter the facility and beach area \u2013 no biggie. If your used to room service, stay at a hotel that offers so.

We stayed on the 14th floor in an oceanview 2 bedroom deluxe and it was nice-not sure what was delux about it but it was comfortable for 2 families with 3 kids under 4. Considering it was a busy holiday weekend, I think things were as good as can be expected with so many people at one place. All of the negative things were a result of the holiday...I think. First, check-in took about hall an hour. Long line, but we got there at 4pm on the dot. Next, parking garage was a zoo and there are not many extra spaces. Only 1 car per reservation, additional cars will have to park across at the city parking garage for $10/day. Do not plan on parking on the street. A) There aren't many spots and B) I wouldn't consider your vehicle safe. I hate to say it since I am from the area, but outside of the Oceanwalk is pretty dirty-old area, cheap housing, lots of homeless people. If you have teenagers---don't let then wander around on the street. There is plenty to do at the Ocean Walk, no need to go outside. So, parking was time consuming but manageable. Next is trying to secure a luggage cart. Forget it from about 4-6! I asked and there are 6 carts! 6! For 800 rooms. Crazy. There are bellman and honestly, it's worth it to pay them and let them do the work. You are on vacation... Why save $$$ at this point. Once we got parked the elevators were the next hurdle. After 25 minute wait we hoofed it up 8 flights of stairs with 2 three year olds and a 8 month old and as many bags as we could handle since we didn't get a cart. Once we got situated though, it was pretty much smooth sailing. Yes, the elevators are slow! Don't get in a hurry or plan to take the stairs. About half the time we didn't wait at all, it just depends what time it is. Few things to consider... If you are going for peace and quiet look into somewhere else (New Symrna Beach is nice and quiet) or go in the off season. If you want a very fun place with lots to do.... Bingo! There are great pools. The kiddie area is great, the lazy river is very nice, there is even a waterslide into one of the pools. Chairs were hard to come by after 8 but like I said... Holiday weekend. Ppl get up early reserve seats with towels all day with out sitting down. I heard that if you point it out to security they will wait half an hour and if no one returns they will clear the chairs and let you have them. Sounds fair. security is out and about and seemed very helpful. Poolside bar was nice, sodas were only $2. Indoor pool was nice, they even host dive-in movies in the evening. Kids loved it. Beach was busy but since it's a no-drive area it's not unbearable. We sat at the very north end of the beach infront of the resort and the crowd was thin. A vendor had chairs and umbrellas set up. $30/day gets you 2 lounge chairs and an umbrella. Good deal if you don't want to lug stuff back and forth. If you do though stuff seemed safe staying down at the beach while ppl went back up to the hotel. We visited the Ocean Walk Shoppes only once for dinner. Not our best idea-waited til 7:00 along with everyone else and every restaurant had 45-1 hour wait. Either go early or call in and get it to-go. You can pretty much check in and not leave again until you check out. Bring food, snacks drinks-you will be set.

It doesn't matter what problems you may run into because Wyndham is a HUGE chain and they know how to work the system, so they will always be right and you as the guest will always be wrong! All of the staff at the front desk are rude and they will tell you anything to get you out of their face. The pools were nasty and desperately needed cleaning...hair and cigarette butts floating all around in both of the larger pools. The lazy river was shut down the entire week we were there and you better not lay your towel on a chair and leave it...even just for a few moments to dip in the pool because the security guards will come by and take your towels and leave you a slip to go pick them up! Basically, they want your money, but they will do nothing to make sure you are happy once you get there. A member of their staff tried entering into our unit without knocking. The card/key was in the door and the door was opening, except we had the door latched at the top, so they were not able to get in. We called front desk, they sent security up and he told us to go on out to the beach and he was going to run a device to see who actually was entering into our unit and would let us know. We never heard a word from anyone at the resort. We asked the front desk again if they knew who was coming into our room and they told us that a \"runner\" had accidentally tried coming into our room. That i can understand...sorta! But, the Manager at Ocean walk proceeds top tell me that nothing else came up on the device except for our key that we used to enter with. Ok, so either the Manager is Lying or the device was erased to protect their staff member. We have been to this hotel before and always enjoyed it, but we also had an incident last year where someone broke into our car and stole our $1,000 camera and our GPS...in a covered and secured parking garage!

We just returned from a week stay at Ocean Walk and these people on here had me very worried w/ all of the negative comments and complaints. We had thought about changing to Bonnett Creek in Orlando as we had been there recently but decided to give Daytona a try. It had been 8yrs since we had last stayed at Ocean Walk as we seem to have the hardest time getting reservations there. We reserved our condo in January and were quite excited until I came on tripadvisor and became worried by what I was reading. First and foremost you with the negative comments need to get a clue! This resort is showing its age a bit but there is a reason, they see so many guests coming and going and using this place of course its going to show some wear and tear. There was not a day that went by that I did not see people working, cleaning, painting all day and into the night. A lot of people complained about the lazy river being down, you can thank the last years Spring Breakers! We talked to management and they said last years Spring Break was horrible on them. They have been struggling to clean and fix all the things they had broken and torn up. This year they were more strict, they had security guards everywhere! They did fix the lazy river while we were there but they had security constantly watching as the pumps were what they tore up and they were so expensive to replace. As far as the rooms, we were in the North Tower and our room was immaculate! One thing I do notice about this resort compared to other Wyndham properties is that there are a lot of owned units here, not managed by Wyndham. If you rent from an owner and not Wyndham you are going to have problems, and you can not blame Wyndham for the condition of the units you need to talk to the owner you rented from. Lastly I saw a lot of complaints here about service. We had an issue right at getting into our room and a toilet not flushing, they were there w/in 10min - left to get parts and were right back and had it fixed. The Guest Services were always kind and helpful and glad to help w/ anything. Please rest assured this is still a great resort and I would not hesitate to stay here again. If I can be of any help to anyone please feel free to contact me.

The person was extremely slow and didn't seem to understand the check in process very well. He stood looking at the computer screen clicking away that took almost 15 minutes even though we had advance reservations. We booked a one bedroom room for the 25th through the 27th. At the front desk we were told it was an inside room. I asked the person if he could give me a price on an oceanfront room. After another 10 minutes he handed me my key. I was just grateful to get it. The crowd behind me was growing. I went to the room and it was a crypt. One window looking in to outside hall. It was dank and dreary with no natural light. Not the way I wanted to spend my days while on vacation at the beach. I went down to the front desk and waited on line again. After a half hour I was told that because I made an internet booking I needed to call the 800 number and change it to the oceanfront that I wanted. The 800 guy was no help. He also stated that he couldn't help me because it was an online booking. He then said to go on the website and modify my room. Of course there was no internet in any of the rooms. I had to tether my cell to my laptop. Again, no area on the website to modify my room. This now has been 2 hours since I checked in. My wife and daughter was waiting for me to resolve this while it was a beautiful day. I went down and asked for the manager. Of course the manager would even come out to talk to me she sent another agent to ask me what was wrong. Finally after 2.5 hours I got another room that was great. I didn't mind paying for the upgrade. But the hassle of that front desk where they had no clue on how to run a resort. After this we went to the Omni Championsgate in Orlando.

We immediatly went back down to the front desk and informed them that we booked a non smoking room and needed to change rooms. They switched us to a different room and we moved all of our bags and belongings to a diferent room, the air conditioner was being worked on so it was pulled out and on the floor in the hallway so we had to switch rooms yet again. They did give us five $10 vouchers for the eatery for the inconvenience tho which was nice. The purpose of my visit was to meet with my wedding vendors because we are having our wedding at the resort in October. I had one of my vendors meet me at the resort to go over some things and she called me from outside because there was nowhere for her to park because you have to have a room key to get into the parking garage at the resort. I called the front dest to ask where she could park and they were extreamly rude to me and told me to go down to the parking area and let her into the garage with my room key. Its going to be such a hassle to have to do that for our wedding guests and vendors on the day of our wedding. We have already booked everything tho so its too late to back out now. The staff is extreamly rude and you always have to call severl times to get the front desk to pick up if you need anything. The lazy river was closed off for renovation also which was dissapointing.

There is plenty to do in the area and the location is great. There are some improvements to be made on the property and if you are a Wyndham owner, be prepared for the early morning call asking you to talk with some Wyndham reps about your \"check in\".. First of all, the resort location is fantastic. You are very close to several pizza joints and local restaraunts. There are a couple bars near by as well as beach gift shops. We didn't make it to the Ocean Walk shoppes but they were busy each time we drove by. The local pizza joints do deliever but you have to pick your order up in the lobby which isn't a problem. Parking wasn't a problem for us until the last night of our stay when we had to park in the south tower versus the north as there wasn't room. The resort is right on the beach and within steps of the outdoor pools. We didn't make it to the \"boarwalk\" but there are rides if you are looking for something to do in the evening. Now to the unplesantries. First of all, we are Wyndahm owners and expected that we wouldn't have housekeeping the week we were there. We got checked in late and were woken on our first morning by a chipper girl named Michelle saying that they wanted to come to our room to do a brief survey to see how check-in went and to bring a \"gift basket\" up. Knowing we would be asked to come to some presentation or other, I told her I wasn't interested but she insisted that it would \"really help us out\" and the questions couldn't be answered over the phone. She assured me the \"visit\" would only take 10 minutes. I called her back a couple hours later saying that we were on our way out if she wanted to send someone up before we left, we would see them. An hour and a half later, two Wyndham employees came up with a JOKE of a \"gift basket\". It had two bottles of water and four small bags of snack foods. I was very firm with them and told them I wasn't interested in going to any presentations, updates or anything else that would take time away from our family vacation. However, we agreed to answer their questions. They asked ONE question about check in and the rest of the 25 minutes was spent trying to convince us to come to a Member Welcome Lunch the following day and so forth. The gentleman also asked if we were aware that we could have had an ocean front room if we only had a few more points. Of course we knew this and pointed out that the room was all we needed for this trip. I had to tell the Wyndham folks several times that we weren't interested in ANYTHING and were just there to vacation, not to be bothered with meetings and the such. Needless to say, we didn't attend the lunch the following day. The resort staff members were very nice, but slow. We called the \"Fun Center\" to have a high chair brought to our room and were told that the woman working was the only one there and couldn't leave so she would have someone from the front desk bring the chair or we had to come get it ourselves. Well, no one ever brought one and we had to get it ourselves later in the evening. To boot, we had to personally return the chair the night before our departure, instead of housekeeping taking care of it for us. Another night, we requested a second blanket for our room and were told it would be bright right up. Well, 45 minutes later, I called again and they said \"it should be on it's way\". After another 45 minutes, I went to the desk personally and asked for the blanket and was told that housekeeping had to get it off the floor \"storeage\" and they had none at the desk. Finally, they called housekeeping and I was advised the blanket had just been delieverd, and it was. On the upside, we also requested extra lanundry detergent and it was brought up very quickly! The lazy river was not working and had been down for at least three weeks. This was the one thing my husband was looking forward to and one of the reasons he booked this resort. The water was green but no one worked on it the entire week we were there. Besides the green water, I'm not sure what needed work on the lazy river. Other reviewers have mentioned needing wrist bands to get into the pools. We were not given wrist bands at check in and none of the security guards questioned us, ever. Maybe this is something more geared to families with older children and college \"spring breakers\" who might be more prone to hotel pool hopping, I don't know. We brought our own beach towels from home so we had no need to use the hotel towels when going to the pool or beach. I have to say that the drink and food prices at the outdoor bar were reasonable and not overpriced as I expected. Beers started at $2 and food platters started at $3.50. We didn't go to the lobby bar or the \"convenient store\" inside the resort so I cannot comment on those prices. Overall, it was a nice stay for our family of three. We don't have enough points for an ocean front room but our one bedroom was just enough for us. There were college spring breakers but they weren't too much of a problem. At one point, there was a loud group of girls walking the hall and I politely stuck my head out asking them to quiet down as we had a baby who was trying to sleep. The girls were nice enough and apologized. I imagine that the ocean front room would have been quieter. On a side note (since I haven't seen it in any other posts), you can rent beach chairs and umbrellas on the beach from non-resort companies. We rented two chairs and an umbrella for $30 for the entire day (until 5PM, when the companies start packing up). The resort towers do begin to block the sun by about 2:30PM and it is difficult to find a place to sit if you get down to the pools in the afternoon. Our daughter really enjoyed the kiddie pool area and other kids played with her. It was a nice change from the louder big kids in the other pools!", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "florida", "Title": "\u201cNot so awesome\u201d", "Author": "lisamotley", "ReviewID": "UR102058425", "Content": "Our family decided to supervise my teenage daughters spring break trip. We rented what seemed like a nice condo from the owner. We stayed in unit 1906 at the Ocean Walk hotel. The unit was on the top floor and the view was amazing but the tremendous amount of smokers smoking on the balcony started early and continued throughout the evening so we couldn't use the balcony. The beach was beautiful but the religous man shouting through a megaphone standing on a bench 1 ft out the gate of the pool area made it unusable. The things he shouted were horrible and insulting. It was offensive that he was allowed to yell those things at anyones child. He would start at 10 am and shout until after 4pm and could be heard all the way on our 19th floor room. The lazy river was green/brown and not operable. The pool deck was packed from sun up to sun down and the water quality reflected the large swim load. The put-put wasn't free as stated in the directory. The nightly Karaoke was loud in the lobby which one evening included the full length version of Michael Jackson's triller. Its was a great video but WAY TOO MUCH SCREAMING for a lobby area. Yikes! Wifi was only free in the lobby so I know this went on every night. When we arrived and were given a list of \"dos\" and \"don'ts\" and were charged a $150 room deposit. We kicked off our shoes when we got there. The tile was grimey and our feet were black in minutes. I felt like I had to leave a kidney on deposit to get a beach towel as we were warned not to use the ones provided in the unit anywhere and that the towels were to be cleaned before we left. Eating options were ok but were a bit pricey. Our family of 5 never left a resturant under $80 and that is without alcoholic drinks. I don't believe I would recommend staying at this resort at this time. Not being able to enjoy the balcony, the beach, or the pool deck was a huge disapointment and certainly not worth what I paid.", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Butler, Florida", "Title": "\u201cIt was just OK\u201d", "Author": "lagators33", "ReviewID": "UR101569393", "Content": "Nothing great about it.

This hotel is centrally located to all the nightclubs and attractions and directly on the beach. The rooms were large, with a washer/dryer, dishwasher, plates and silverware...fully stocked. The downside was that there was no housekeeping during the stay and we were forced to reuse our towels. 4 beach towels are provided per room with only one exchange per stay. The pool fills up during the morning and it's impossible to find a seat if you don't get there early. Around 2, the hotel starts hiding the sun and people start moving to the beach to catch some sun. The pools and slide were heated and warm. There were two indoor pools that very few people used. I was a little angry that the lazy river was closed and looked like algae or yellow water was floating around. My friends and I went down for Spring Break and I highly recommend this hotel. We picked up a VIP pass for $25 and enjoyed free beer from 8 to 10 and no cover for each club during the week. Great deal but there were tons of spring breakers taking advantage of this deal so there were long lines. The hotel is about two blocks away from Razzles, Aqua, and Lounge 509 which are the hottest clubs in Daytona. There's plenty of good restaurants nearby. 32oz mugs of beer for $3.29...I'd spend more than 4 times that amount in New York City.

In comparison to last year's good experience, this year's was 'not so great'. The only thing superb was the weather. The positives first. Yes, Ocean Walk is still the best value on Daytona Beach for families who want a large, oceanfront unit with all of the comforts of home including a full kitchen that is near everything. The Hilton stands just next door but there is no comparison. No balconies, kitchens or decent pool there. I gave Ocean Walk four stars last year because it is NOT a full service hotel like the Hilton, with a sit down restaurant, room service, valet etc...If you want THAT, go THERE.I enjoy the convenience of self-catering. No lines, tips, bad service or getting dressed to go out to eat. And then there is the huge tab.We have saved literally thousands over the years 'timesharing'. Disappointments at Ocean Walk this year: The lazy river, a point of relaxation and fun last year was closed and had algae growing on the walls. I never once saw anyone working on it to get it up and running while we were there. The entire property had been invaded by spring breakers. Every night we were there they invaded and took over the South hot tub and drank beer there until the early hours, in a very loud and often vulgar manner. I was awakened one night at 2 AM by drunken screaming from a balcony nearby. That South hot tub itself was very unclean, murky and had a greenish tint all of the time we were there. I watched the South deck cleaners open up the deck each morning before sunrise. The fellow with the powerwasher would focus on the area around the hot tub and the entrance to the water slide, then quit. I guess he then felt able to say Yes, I powerwashed the deck\" to his supervisor. Unmotivated, I suppose. Too bad his efforts did NOT show improvements. The entire deck needs to be powerwashed more often AND re-surfaced. The deck swarmed with spring breakers every day,and Ocean Walk catered to them by playing VERY LOUD music. The bar now advertises to the general public \"$3 draft beer\" on a large, permanent banner to the general public walking by on the boardwalk. At the Eastern boardwalk entrance, a room key is no longer required to enter the pool deck area. Thus, enter ALL of those who are not staying at Ocean Walk who want to use the deck and buy that cheap beer! Forget security. There is none at Ocean Walk any more. The room card security lock at the entrance from Ocean Walk shoppes complex has been disabled as well. I guess the security of Wyndham's guests is not too important anymore...at least not at Ocean walk. I felt safe last year letting our two tween kids roam the property when the security system was working and being enforced. I saw FEW people wearing their pool deck ID bracelets because that simply was not being firmly enforced. We wore ours for the first two days of our one week stay, then just took them off because.hey, when in Rome...The only difference was that we had the RIGHT to be in Rome while others obviously did NOT because of the lax security. This is probably the worst mistake Wyndham can make at this property because there are dozens of young people loitering around outside the resort on the streets at any given time. Obviously many of them are not there to go to church, as evidenced by their physical dress and appearances. In our unit: The balcony railing in our 2 BR unit was filthy. I wiped part of it with a white wash rag and it came away black. On the ledge outside the master BR window there was pigeon waste. The balcony itself needed a powerwashing too. The balcony furniture was grimy. In the unit itself, two stove burners had to be plugged back in before they could be used. The dryer squeaked loudly when it was used, there were cracked tiles in the unit, the dishwasher was loose, the master BR smelled slightly of vomit....Thank God the safe worked...I would have been somewhat afraid to leave my valuables out in the open with ZERO SECURITY... We won't be using our Wyndham points or spending our money at Ocean walk again unless there is a change of management to one whose financial hands have not been tied by 'corporate' and has a watchful eye for details. If there are no immediate changes Wyndham's Daytona Beach Ocean Walk, flagship of the Florida Southeast Atlantic seaboard should be re-named to 'Titanic' except no one is even polishing the brass anymore....Too bad. One more item.Each suite reservation gets only ONE parking space despite the size of your party,even if you are in a 3 bedroom which sleeps what,10 people? Great! All other members in the party who bring a car get to pay for parking in the public parking garage across the street.How unrealistic.Wyndham could not strike a deal with the garage to provide reduced rates or even free parking like OTHER nearby businesses do,in exchange for their guests' patronage? It's only good business....Aparrently the bottom line has to be REAL FAT,eh Wyndham?", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsfield, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cCouldn't have planned it any better.\u201d", "Author": "Creative20", "ReviewID": "UR100602696", "Content": "We were very pleased.

I gave her the details of the reservation, price, the information about the confirmation page., but I did not have the confirmation number due to driving down the road and not being able to write it down or print. I thought no problem and asked her just to start a new one and check me in. No problem right? Wrong, she informed me that I would have to pay the rack rate, you know the max rate posted on the back of doors in some hotels. It was $200 more then what I had booked and she was happy about it. Hey, it's after midnight, I'm tired and I informed her that was not correct. She was more interested flirting with the drunks that had stumbled up then helping me which really annoyed me. I tried pulling up my email etc but no confirmation number etc. This room was going to go unsold and I had enough details to be believable but no confirmation. Any hotel I have ever stayed at would have done the right thing and given the room to me at the online rate but not her.

WHAT? and the very loud drunk bikers continued to come and go unnoticed by her, the manager and security. No one had gotten loud, cussed or anything except complain normally. The manager stuck by full rack rate despite me looking up the rate on a ipad and showing her that now the rate had even gotten lower for the next 3 night I was staying.. She was as rude as they come and did not care. So I paid the extra 200 for the first night and booked the other night under a separate reservation with her watching.

When we arrived it took me over two hours to get them to actually give us (7) one bedrooms as he only reserved five. I have to admit Dillia was absolutely wonderful in helping me with this. Later we were informed they only have (3) three bedrooms to sell in the entire complex and they sold our's out from under us. Needless to say we will never stay there again. The activities were poorly ran and in fact my husband dealt cards for the poker tournament one night because they had no one to run it. They were always late for activities and blamed it on people not showing up. I wonder why ?? My parents unit didn't have hot water and were informed to get up early and take their showers before everyone else. They were finally moved to another unit. The plumbing was very poor and the coffee maker and toaster didn't even work. Just one more hassel to getting things fixed. What a disappointing Christmas for us. They also said they would compensate us for all the hassel and we never heard from them, \"except\" to fill in this review, so that is what I am doing.

I rented through an owner. The units were very nice and reasonable. We had an ocean front side (side A) and hallway side (side B). Overall, I am happy with the owner I went through and if anyone wants to send me a message to find out the owner, feel free. Everything that we needed was there: beach chairs, umbrellas, bedding, fully equipped and working kitchens, washer/dryers, beach toys, more...The view from the balcony was very nice. Ocean front just like the picture. The location of the hotel is really good. It is right on the ocean and within walking distance to shops and places to eat. It is in the nicer area of Daytona. The bad: Like most people have said on here, the customer service is really awful. We didn't ask them for anything like towels or paper products, because we knew we had to launder everything ourselves and buy our own tp, stuff like that. My spouse did complain to the management a couple times about a high pitched noise that made sitting on the balcony or around the pools sometimes unbearable. A security person determined it was one of the pool pumps. It was so loud, we could hear it with the balcony door closed in the living area of the room and all the way out to the beach. My spouse approached a manager about it a second time and the manager was a smart [-]. He said, well you could move to the other pool. No sorry. No we will repair it. Even if we moved to the other pool, it was so loud it could be heard no matter where you went. Oh. And the really STUPID rule with the pool towels. Get this. You are allowed to check out towels and you need to launder them. You can't exchange them for fresh ones except for one time the entire stay. So, if you exchange ONE of your towels, early, say one towel fell into the pool and you didn't want to drag the sopping went towel up through the lobby, onto the elevator, down a hall and into the room, that counts as the one exchange. You are NOT ALLOWED to exchanged anymore towels. Really, every hotel I have ever stayed at allowed towel exchanges anytime. The pools outside were so cold it felt like there were ice cubes floating in it. The inside pools were not much warmer. The ocean in November was warmer than the pools. Like other people have mentioned, there are tons of hair floating in the pools and hot tub. Supposedly, they will be replacing the pool pumps this month, but come on. Did they ever hear of a pool skimmer? The lazy river looked greenish, but it might have been the paint color. In any case, none of my children were willing to take a chance on that. The pool water looked clean in all the pools I saw, except for the hair. It is a nice hotel. The lobby is nice. The pool areas are nice. I think it could be a very nice place if they get rid of just about all the management people and the stupid rules they have. And let me emphasis again, go through an owner. You will get a much better room and if anything happens, you can call the owner and not have to deal with the management at that hotel. I would only recommend this hotel to a friend if they rented a unit through the owners we used. I would suggest to a friend that they stay during a less busy season, like we did. We had no trouble finding chairs around the pool, check in was fast, it was quiet, and I think had it been busier, we would have ran into some of the problems other people mentioned.

We also loved the ocean and we had a great trip in spite of the poor customer service. Checking in took forever and most of the time spent was waiting for the one person ahead of me on line to be checked in. My husband waited in the car outside and was told he had to move his car when we hadn't even received a room key let alone a parking pass. After checking in I was told that I had to see the concierge for pool passes. Before you can get the pool passes they try to get you to commit to attending a time share presentation for 90 minutes. Meanwhile my husband is still getting harassed in the car at the drive up check in entrance outside and all I want are my pool passes! Every room in the hotel gets one parking space. That is fine for a one bedroom but in our three bedroom we needed three passes. it was quite a hassle to get them and the public parking that they wanted us to use was an expensive rate. Every request to the front desk was an adventure in bad customer service except for the woman who finally opened a line and checked me in after waiting for a long time and the person in the sun room who allowed me to borrow a wheelchair for the weekend for my elderly Mom. Those two encounters were the only pleasant ones I had with staff the entire weekend.

Thieves took our camcorder, digital camera and computer while we were out to dinner. Oddly enough, our safe did not work, which we reported but a part needed to be ordered to repair it. We put our money/ipods in a friend's safe that was staying at the Ocean Walk as well. We discovered after we were burgarlized that the door did not shut/lock properly. When you leave the balcony door open, it creates a wind tunnel, causing the door to slam. After this happens over and over, the door evenutally comes off balance and does not line up with the lock correctly. When we left the room, we thought the door was locked, we pulled it shut tight behind us and checked the door handle, but all you had to do was either push hard against the door or put a driver's license or a room key between the door and the door jam, and the door would pop open. We have video of how easy it was to open our door (of course we had to borrow a friend's camcorder since ours was stolen). Had my husband not noticed this, our room could have been broken into over and over. What really upsets me is it is just stuff, but my 17 year old daugter returned to the room alone that night at 9:30 while we stopped off at a friend's room. I hate to think of what could have happened if she entered the room and they were in there. The entire rest of our vacation, I did not feel safe. They did repair the door, but I did not feel safe staying there. The management blamed it on the private owner not providing proper maintenace, but honestly there is a total lack of security. There are 3 security guards on duty - 1 in the basement that distributes the keys to the maids, 1 at the pool area and 1 in the lobby. There are no security cameras or security personnel that patrols the hallways. Anyone can enter the hotel and go anywhere in the complex - you do not need a room key to wander around all 25 floors -except for the pool - they guard that really well. You also do not need a key to enter via the garage, you can just push hard against that door and it will pop open as well. Anyone has access to the garage from inside the complex. We did contact the hotel mgmt, security and Daytona Beach Police. While I was in the lobby walking the police office out, another gentleman stopped us and asked us if I had been robbed. He said his safe didn\u2019t work and his room was robbed as well. Ocean Walk was advertised to me by the owner as a \"5 Star Resort\". I\u2019ve been in 5 Star Resorts and this certainly is not one. Besides the robbery, the safe was broken, ants in the kitchen, dishwasher did not work, no remote, or remote did not work for the tvs. My husband repaired the bedroom door himself so it would shut properly. The room needed updating, but it has a beautiful view and location and we were willing to overlook these details. We cannot overlook a robbery. Not only did we lose our items, but we lose several days of vacation waiting in the room while the safe was repaired, working with the police, hotel security, and while the man repaired the door. The owner offered to repair the dishwasher and I said \"never mind\" I wanted to get to the beach just a little bit at least during my vacation! People are entering the Ocean Walk like lambs going to a slaughter. This is recognized as a place for families, yet they have no security to protect those staying there. Please think twice before staying here and putting your family in danger like I did. I didn't take the warnings seriously of other postings thinking it couldn't happen to me - it did and it can happen to you. If you have also stayed at Ocean Walk and were robbed, please contact me through Trip Advisor. I have filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, Hotel and Motel Regulation, sent letters to the Wyndham Corporation, the mgr of the Ocean Walk, Joe McMenamin, the private owner I have rented from, the Daytona Beach Chamber of Commerce, The Mayor of Daytona Beach and the Chief of Police.

Everything of any value had been taken such as $3,000.00 in cash from a shirt in our suitcase, my purse, wallet all my credit cards our keys to our bike, bike trailer, vehicle, jewlery cell phones. Had to call a locksmith to have keys cut so we could get home which cost us $300.00. The police tsaid the security at this resort was terrible and they have been having alot of trouble. The security guard that was on duty was elderly and they had no security cameras at all!! Overall we had a claim for around $13,000.00 as far as how much was taken. Basically the Wyndham manager did not want to deal with us was very unsympathetic and pretty much tried to avoid the whole situation. We were DEVASTATED. The manager ended up moving us to another room after this happened and the lock on the door of that room was broke. After just being robbed behind a door that was locked and moved to this room I was a nervous wreck. To make a long story short after having to put a fraud report on my credit file and cancel many credit cards etc. I asked the Wyndham if they would credit us the last few nights of our stay not even because of the break in but because we paid for an oceanfront room and they moved us into a tiny room with no windows and a door which was not even safe. Management told us they could not do anything for us and that we would need to take care of things on our own and use our homeowners insurance.

The wall paper was falling off the walls, the paint/plaster was falling off the walls, and there were huge water spots in the ceiling right above the bed were it had been leaking. The worst was the toilet that did not work from the moment we got there. (only one bathroom) It was thursday..by friday the maintence man \"fixed\" it...it still did not flush right. Friday night we were told on sat they would have someone to fix it at 9am. We left the room and came up for lunch, not one person had been in our room at this point. I called the desk and was told \"they are coming right up\" We came back at 430 to find \"Dumb and Dumber\" the \"plumbers\" attempting to fix the toilet. I was then told they had to pull the toilet. When I asked how long that would take I was told it would take hours and was advised to \"use the public bathroom by the pool\" . This is on top of all the hastle already including the fact we didn't even have pillows in our room and when I called for some I was told \"we are out because people take them home\" We did not get pillows until after 24 hours of my begging did they finally bring us pillows. They also finally brought us cooking items. I had to get the manager involved into getting our room moved after the toilet incident. He did move us to another room not before the plumbers broke the water shutoff taking out the toilet flooding the room. The grounds are needing a good cleaning and the bottom of the pools are black with dirt that you could see from our 19th floor room. There is paint peeling everywhere on the pool deck and no one had ever cleaned the pool. The lazy river is green and needed to be cleaned as well. As far as their activities dept. It consists of a bunch of college kids that are just \"putting in their time\" and do not care about making it fun for kids or families. The Ocean Walk could be a nice place due to the location but no one cares at all about it and it is falling apart.

This resort is labeled as a Wyndham resort, and only a few floors are dedicated to Worldmark owners. i first have to say that the the staff was friendly, there is an onsite little market place that is convenient, and the prices were reasonable. there is also an interior bar that we didnt get to experience because of the open times, however, the bar outside by the pool area that also served food, was fine enough. the location of the resort is smack dab in the middle of Daytona Beach and is right on the sand. there are many other hotels surrounding the Wyndham Ocean Walk, including the Ocean Walk shops, VERY CONVENIENT. there is a Sloppy Joes, a Mai Tai bar/restaurant, and many other touristy places to venture. we also had the opportunity to watch a Summer Jazz festival that was going on while we were there (Aug 15th). the patio at the Mai Tai bar had a perfect view of the stage while we sipped our coctails. there is also a family fun center literally across the street from the hotel on the adjacent block called Daytona Lagoon. very fun arcade for kids, water park, bumper boats, and go carts. the hotel itself had 2 different pools with a lazy river and 1 kiddie area. the main pool had a slide that the kids and adults enjoyed. while we were there, there was also a very large inflatable water slide that cost $20 unlimited per day, or $3 per ride. most of the kids LOVED this ride. i'm not sure how often this is available, but i assume it's for the entire summer. there is a gate entrance from the pool area that leads you directly onto Daytona's Beach...very convenient! there were also beach bicycle rentals directly on the beach, along with some snack trucks if you get hungry on the beach, and dont feel like pool bar food. the resort rooms themselves were very comparable to what we're used to at Worldmark. Fully stocked kitchen, washer/dryer. we stayed in a 3 bed 3 bath room because we had not only our family but two other families with us. we live in Jacksonville, FL, so it's only an hour and a few minutes away for a convenient weekend getaway, which is how we vacation anyway. the only thing i have to say about this resort, is it is a bit crowded for a Worldmark resort. as Worldmark owners, we do enjoy the exclusivity of being Worldmark/Trendwest owners. this Wyndham resort is extremely big with many accommodations, and was extremely busy...i'd say to capacity. i wouldnt say it was PACKED with people, but i will say that it was much busier than what we're used to with our exclusively Worldmark resorts. of course, this didnt bother the kids, since they just make new friends with the other families present. i'm guessing this hotel was this busy because we are in the Summer Vacation period, just before school starts. most families just want one last weekend getaway before the busy school year starts; this is the reason for us anyway. there is a put put miniature golf (free) on the 4th floor of the South tower, an underground pool hall and entertainment room, as well as an arcade right next door, an indoor pool, and even a business center with free internet where i saw a lot of teen agers facebooking :) there was no free internet in any of the rooms, but i suspect if you bring your laptop to the business center, there will have likely been wi-fi available. one last thing, the resort on the North side of the Wyndham buildings (opposite of the Ocean Walk side), did have a bar and pool of it's own. i believe this is the Hawaiian Inn Owner Rentals. our balcony and master bedroom faced the ocean, and the Hawaiian Inn's bar and pool were directly below us. at night, they have a singer there on Saturday night, and the noise came through the windows on our 14th floor that made it difficult to go to sleep. the music was on until about 1 am, so please take that into consideration. besides the noise from the neighboring hotel, and the amount of people, this resort was very nice, and very accommodating. i will say, that the floors reserved for Worldmark guests were VERY QUIET in comparison to the rest of the resort...likely on purpose. great hotel, great stay...definitely recommend for a FAMILY stay...", "Date": "August 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dawsonville, GA", "Title": "\u201cNot what it used to be....\u201d", "Author": "jbrockn2", "ReviewID": "UR75472018", "Content": "We have been staying @ Ocean Walk for over 10 years and this was undoubtable the worst stay in all those years.

However, others in line that had been there before said it was the most crowded they had ever seen it, and that it is not always that way. I booked direct through the hotel's 1-800 number. We got the exact type of room that we requested with no problems. We stayed in a one-bedroom oceanfront. The room, while a little worn around the edges (perfectly understandable given the volume of people they cycle through there), was good size, and while the beds were firmer than I am used to, they slept surprisingly well. The room was adequately equipped with everything we needed. Plenty of towels and nice bed linens. The elevators were only slow on Saturday during check-in times. We had no issues with slow elevators for the rest of our stay. The pool was very crowded, and the chairs were usually full, but we never went without one for a long period of time. People were always coming and going, and several people offered to give up their extras when they saw us looking. I think people just need to be more realistic in their expectations. This is a condo, so there is no maid service. I've never been to a popular condo on the beach where pool chairs are not hard to come by, so that is not unique to this resort and should be expected. The rates were way less than a comparable room at the Hilton, so you can't expect Hilton quality. Manage your expectations, and you will be well pleased with this resort. We thought it was a great value. We loved the convenience to the Ocean Walk Village next door, and we played the indoor miniature golf course multiple times. The Saturday night fireworks next door were a great start to our vacation. As long as you don't mind the crowds, this is a great place for families with kids because there is so much to do.

After another half hour, if the security guards do not notice anyone using the chairs they put all items on the chairs into a bag and send them to a location inside the hotel where the guest would need to pick them up. So you and your family go up to the room to get a change of clothes or a snack for the kids or may even take a walk on the beach and when you come back down, your chairs are being occupied by someone else, who have had the same thing happen to them the day before so they are nasty and obnoxious.

Overall, it was a great vacation. Pros: Great location, had pools, game rooms, activities indoors (i.e. gym, craft room, movie rental box for $1 a night). Room had kitchen (with granite counters, which was a nice touch); allowed us to eat in some meals and not eat out all the time. Free in-room wireless internet worked great for us. Being originally from Long Island AND traveling to Myrtle and outer banks, we did not consider the beach 'crowded'. Sand was nice, surf was great and there was pleanty of space to be found. Walking distance to Ocean Walk shoppes for restaurants, a huge water park/go-carts/arcade and several restarants, so if you didn't want to drive, you didn't need to. Concierge is helpful - we got some good discounts (i.e. free appetizers at local restaurants) and discounts on some tours - highly recommend seeking them out when you get there. Would recommend that you bring a canopy or beach umbrella and chairs if you plan on sitting on the beach. A local company rents them for $30 a day (one umbrella, small side table and 2 lounge chairs), but that gets very expensive and given how hot the sun gets, we needed to fork over the money. Next time, we will bring our tailgating tent and chairs to save the money. On the downside, like the other postings, resort does need some updating...specifically, we thought the room furniture (esp the beds) needed new mattresses, carpet can use replacing and the 1980s beach decor was dated. Air conditioner was very loud as well. While everything worked just fine, hotel needs to start investing a bit. If it's important to you, I would also specify Ocean Front vs Ocean View. There is clearly a difference. We had ocean view (which we could see the ocean from our balcony...but it wasn't the ocean front we were hoping for (walk on to the balcony and all you see is ocean. Beware, too - we were on the north side of the building - we could see directly into the neighboring buildings and right above the garbage dumpsters. So, at 6pm (when we wanted to have a drink on the balcony, it stunk outside from the full dumpsters. We couldn't even enjoy our ocean view. Additionally, elevators got very crowded quickly - so when you can jump on one, do it, even if you need to go down a floor before going up. Timeshares are typically no-frills (no daily maid service, clean your own, sales pitches), so none of that was a surprise to us. Overall, for a timeshare resort, this one is a bit better than others that we've seen. We would consider staying here again if our travels point to the beach.

We decided to take a vacation in Daytona Beach and none of us had ever been there. We have never taken a family vacation and it was up to me to book and plan the trip. I got on the internet, searched vacation condos in Daytona Beach on vacationrentals.com and several rentals popped up. The pictures and description of the Ocean Walk were tempting, so I contacted the agent/owner listed and made the arrangements. She was very friendly and helpful. I also felt that she was very upfront with me. She explained that even with a request for an oceanfront condo, we might not get it. Our condo may be situated on a corner that had a view of the city and the beach. It was only after I booked and paid that I started looking at reviews of the place and my heart sank. There were tons of unfavorable ones and very few good reviews. I was almost sick. I decided to just make the most of our vacation and hope for the best. After a hellish trip from SW Indiana, we got to the resort. With six of us and tons of luggage, we took two cars. There is room for one car at the resort's parking garage and the other car (if you take two) has to be parked elsewhere. The only place we could find was across the street at the Ocean Walk Shops parking garage. That cost around $16 a day. Next time we will try to find cheaper parking for the extra car. Our trip entailed a two hour traffic jam so I had called the resort to let them know we would be arriving a couple of hours late. They noted it and assured me it was no problem. Let me first address the \"cons\" I read about and what I found in comparison. Crowded busy check-in: Folks, it's a huge resort with tons of people checking in. It's going to be busy. Be patient. If you didn't get the condo you thought you were getting, I bet it's not the desk clerk's fault. No maid/cleaning service/laundry service: The website makes it clear that there are washer/dryers in each unit so you can do your laundry. This isn't a hotel. You are responsible for cleaning, doing dishes, and such. I don't know how so many people misunderstood that unless they just did not read the descriptions. Need for more elevators and luggage carts: Huge problem. The resort is comprised of two towers with at least 23 floors (?) each. Only four elevators for each tower??? It gets very crowded and lines form at check-in, check-out, and when rain drives everyone in from the pool/beach. I don't know how many luggage carts there are, but they need more. Not only are they used for luggage, but we found it necessary, as did others, for hauling groceries to the condo. Be prepared to leave your driver's license to use a luggage cart. That being said, we absolutely fell in love with the Ocean Walk!!! We did get an oceanfront room with a beautiful view from the 19th floor of the north tower. The 2 bedroom condo was on a corner, the kitchen had the basics needed for cooking and dining for a family of eight. There were six of us, two parents and four children ages 20-8. We loved having the beach just steps from the resort. The putt-putt course on the 4th floor came in handy when rain came, as did the computer rooms and arts and crafts studio. There are tons of brochures and coupons available from the concierge. We opted out of the \"sales pitch\" and were never once pressured to attend or buy. The mini-mall next to the resort I found to be noisy, crowded, and pricey. Our stay was fairly low-key. Deep sea fishing, parasailing, and shopping was as exciting as we got. We loved it. The pools and lazy river all seemed very nice and the kids enjoyed all of them daily. Me, I want the beach. There is a towel service for beach towels. You can check out towels but be warned, it is $15 for each towel you lose and don't turn back in. We took our own beach towels, but used theirs also to keep from doing laundry all the time. We also took extra bath towels and that turned out to be a good idea. We were supplied with several bath towels, washcloths, kitchen towels, a few rolls of paper goods, some trash bags, small packets of laundry detergent and dishwasher soap, and some bath soap and shampoo. Go shopping when you get there to stock up. The washer/dryers are stacked units and small. One night the a/c didn't seem to be cooling. I called about it and had help within two minutes. They instructed what to do and even waited while I tried it. Remember to turn on the icemaker when you get there. All in all, I was surprised by the bad reviews I read. Maybe your experience depends on when you go. Maybe it's how the owner/agent handles the unit. Maybe some people are just never happy.

I took 4 teenagers, ages 16 to 18. After returning from Wal-Mart, we were not allowed to enter the entrance door of our parking lot due to some blood in the doorway. Come to find out 1 of my 4 teenagers had been attacked after exciting the elevator. In the elevator, a thug was stepping on my daughters toes. She requested several times for him to stop, moved and he continue to purposely step on her toes. My 16 year old son told him to stop as well as the cousin. After the elevator stopped and my kids got off, the thugs got off and followed them to the parking lot. One of them punched my cousins child in the nose - blood everywhere. My kids went to the front desk to report. After I found out, myself and my cousin was with them - police, medics came. We requested they pull video - we wanted to file charges. They were older and these were 16 year old boys. My kids had perfect description and knew what floor they had punched. They were to contact us when the found them. After leaving, I had a bad feeling they were not going to even look for them. They had also punched a hole in the wall by the elevator. The thug actually knocked his girlfriend around some in all the commotion. This was a nightmare, and needless to say ruined the vacation. We were scared to let the kids leave us after that. The child with the broke nose is in surgery today. He also has nerve damage. The hotel cleaned up the blood and patched the hole in the wall really quickly, but never contacted us again to see how he was doing or anything. As the week went on, his face got worse looking and hurting more. I phoned the hotel today to let them know I was disappointed in them never following up. That I worried about them in the ocean and on the strip, but didn't know I had to worry about them in that nice hotel. I was just told I would need to contact the Daytona Police Department - that their security wouldn't be able to arrest or do anything. There was absolutely NO CONCERN over this severely injured 16 year old boy. I find this very disturbing as well as everyone I've told this to. PLUS<<<<< the elevator is a nightmare. At some times the line would be 50 people long,,,you would have to wait 5 or 6 times to be able to get on. The parking was just as bad. You had to hurry home from eating because after about 10:00 there were no parking places left (they only allow you one). If you don't have one, oh well - park across the street and pay 20.00 a day. The room was nice, but did have a hugh roach when we arrived waiting for us! They provided us with 2 washclothes. Luckily we had a washer & dryer and I had brought my own washclothes.

One pool had an amazing amount of human hair floating in it and the other had thick grease smeared on the sides. The lazy river was an unusual shade of green which my 8 year old thought was due to the resort using real river water- sadly, she was wrong. Parking was terrible. Our non-smoking suite had cigarrette burns and the bed had blood stains. We were told they weren't planning on cleaning our room when we called about the blood, but after 2 calls and 4 hours, they did bring us some fresh bedding to change on the bed. Towels were strictly allocated and limited, but fortunately, the units have washers and dryers so you can wash the towels yourself.

With the exception of the employee who greeted us in the driveway, all employees were flippant and acted as though we were trying to scam them out of something(like clean bedding!). Also, they employ a person to go door to door to make sure that you do not overstay.

The kitchens are hit or miss as to how well stocked they are with utensils and cookware(we had friends staying in the same resort, so could pull together a spoon, pot, and colander between 3 rooms). My family used the stairs whenever possible (10 flights!) and the stairwell smelled of urine. Of course, we had numerous offers to buy timeshares while staying there. Also, security was very poor.

This year I made the mistake of renting from Wyndham or Holiday Express and will never rent through them again. I rented and paid for a 618 square foot studio suite that was supposed to have two beds, a couch, little living room area, kitchenette and an ocean view. When I checked in at the Wyndham, the front desk failed to advise that the air conditioning had been broke for over 24 hours. I soon realized that was the least of my concerns. After we brought our luggage to our room, I realized that Wyndham must have put me in the wrong room. Our room was no more than 300 square feet, no couch, no ocean view, unless I leaned over the balcony and looked beyond a building and only one of the two burners worked on the stove. The room was not updated as the pictures on the website shows. There was a VCR with a 32\u201d bulky TV. The wall paper was tearing off the wall. The furniture was hideous with what appeared to be grease stains smeared all over. I have stayed at cheap hotels with nicer living conditions. The stove had grease an inch thick and the floors were very filthy. Having three adults and a toddler, this was not a room I wanted to stay in for the next 8 days. I immediately called the manager on duty, Guido, and explained to him that I am supposed to be in a studio suite and not a one person efficiency studio and that my room was filthy (I have photos of the filth that I will attach. If they are not with this review - this means management took them off and did not want you to view them.!..) and there was not an ocean view balcony. Guido advised that I was indeed in the wrong room, but there was nothing he could do because there were no more rooms available. He did not offer to have my room cleaned, a refund - NOTHING. He told me there is not one thing he can do to fix my problem. He gave a name and number and told me to contact that person at Holiday Express. I called the number three times that week and left three messages, but never received a call back. Luckily we had beautiful weather and did not have to be in our room much; I love the resort and will go back but would never rent through the Wyndham/Holiday Express again. On my last day, I explained my room situation to another manager who advised that I would receive 30% back on my charge card the following Monday for the \"room mistake\".

Then wait a half an hour to get reimbursed the next day. Air conditioning went out for the whole north tower and they had to go around and flush each air conditioning unit . We were told at 8:30 am that our name was on the list. 13 hours later we went down to front desk and find out no one put our name on the list. We asked if we could leave and not have to pay for that night and were told the charge was already on our credit card and they don't have the authority to do credits at the hotel because I booked over the phone. So we were stuck there. By chance when we went upstairs after complaining Maintenance was in the unit next to ours and they came in and flushed our air conditioning. Then it started working. We decided to stay up late and watch some T.V.. We could only get Channel 2. I called the front desk and was told that the cable was out.. Wow!!!! This place was unbelievable! I am glad we only stayed here for 3 days! Daytona in itself doesn't look to have very nice properties to stay at . From the looks of the Wyndham it looked to be one of the better ones. I guess looks are definitely deceiving. The last kicker of the trip! >>> When I goy home my credit card statement was waiting for me. I open it up and I am already charged for my stay. The place also charged me $25. twice for the resort fee.. I called them up and was told \" Oh yes, we did make a mistake we will credit you next month.\" So word of advice make sure to check your statements!

I assume it was because they had to shock it. The place holds so many people that it is worse than being at Disney World during busy season.

Of course the location is great, right on the boardwalk. Restaurants and shopping at your fingertips. So although this was convenient, there were lots of inconveniences. For example, upon arrival, you have to leave your driver's license in order to get a shabby falling apart luggage cart that you have to \"check out\". Then you have to check out Towels and promise to pay for them if you lose one. There are so few chairs by the pool area that you are not allowed to leave your towels on them for more than 30 minutes or the security gaurd will take them to allow someone else to have a seat. So if you go up to your room for lunch then you might as well surrender your spot by the pool. Anyway, the pools are dirty and the lazy river has not been cleaned in a long while. There are never enough floating rafts for you to get in. They are not policed like the towels so you can stand there and wait for a raft and you still might not get one. If you want to go to the beach, the area in front of the resort is very crowded and the local chair/umbrella company sets up their rentals on the first line at the beach. These cost $25.00 day. So four days at the beach, $100.00 if you didn't bring your own chairs. If you did bring your own chairs you have to try to squeeze them somewhere in between or behind the ones that are already set up, unless you wait for the tide to go out, then you have to worry about it coming back in, soaking all of your stuff. We had a 3 bdrm unit, (which are ALL ocean front), but we had only two crappy chairs on the balcony to sit in. What good is a balcony if you cant enjoy relaxing on it? Our room was fine, but we had to ask for kitchen items that were already supposed to be stocked. They were supposed to come up and inventory the kitchen for all of the missing items and they didn't, they only brought two of the items I asked for that I needed.

We took part in movie nights by the pool, kids crafts and contests, music and dances and volleyball daily. We would like to make a few suggestions to improve the appearance of your resort. Our children loved swimming in the big pool with the water slide. My husband and I wanted to avoid this pool as there we huge chunks of hair floating in the pool. We were disappointed that the pool was not cleaned daily. We believe that this could be avoided with the proper care. In addition, when we took our girls to use the restroom by this pool there were six toilets filled with fecal matter and paper. We can understand that people can be irresponsible but we were disappointed that staff members did not check and clean the restrooms periodically throughout the day. Lastly, we would appreciate that spills and trash be cleaned up off the pool deck occasionally. This is a large resort and we believe that constant supervision of these areas are necessary for good health and enjoyment. We felt the priority of the staff was to monitor pool chairs and not the overall cleanliness of the pool area. We hope you will take these suggestions into consideration to make these well needed improvements. We look forward to returning next summer and are encouraging four more families to join us.

It didn't even wash the clothes. The room itself looks so outdated! With the money they are bringing in at that place, you would think they would update!!!! The carpet and couch was nasty! The ice box was loud, the ice maker quit working mid way through our trip and water started coming out of the bottom of the fridge. I contacted the maint. man that we were told to call with any issues and I couldn't even get his # to go through, so I called the front desk and told them and I had to leave a voicemail for the building maint. man.

There was what looked as blood smeared on the bathroom floor next to the wall between the 2 bathroom doors and there was also some on the front of one of the dresser drawers. The toilet wouldn't flush right. There was hair all over the bathroom floor, around the toilet and tub etc...The shower curtain...OMG! It was molded on both sides from top to bottom!!!! There wasn't even a liner on the shower. It was a cloth shower curtain! I also assumed (could be my fault) that we would of had at least one dish rag and one dish towel, and there was nothing.

The first room was, (after we managed to get security to let us in because the electronic lock was broken) not the size room I reserved and paid for in advance and it was torn apart. The carpet was disgusting. The walls trashed and the vases or whatnots on the shelf next to the TV were broken and had sharp pointy edges. Luckily for our family we do not have small children. The couch, chair and stove where torn apart as if someone was in the middle of searching for something or perhaps got interrupted during cleaning. The trash was on the on top of the bar where guest are supposed to eat. I called to complain about the size and condition of the room and was told \"Rooms are not guaranteed.\" What? They sure as heck took my money in advance to guarantee that I would show up! The least they could have done was to give me what I paid for! I was told \"there is nothing we can do the resort is booked.\" No apologies on the wrong room no nothing - just tough. The front desk did agree to send someone up to clean the room, but when the maid got there all she did was drop off a couple of bars of hand soap and leave without cleaning a stinking thing. So resigned to getting ripped off and stuck in a substandard filthy room, my husband and I go to the bedroom to unpack for our two day stay and found that the linen was visibly filthy. I called down and ask for clean linen. Of course they didn't bring it so I had my daughter call back down and ask again. This time a male staff member was extremely RUDE to my daughter and asked her why I wanted clean linen. You would think that an explanation for clean linen would not be needed. The TV remote didn't work which wasn't a big deal until I tried to turn it on manually and found that the on/off button had been removed or yanked out. There was a whole where normally a button would be and I wasn't about to stick my finger in it so I called to ask for batteries. I think this fourth, fifth or sixth call to the front desk finally made them take note and miraculously a room (the type I paid for) became available. So now we are in room two after wasting hours of our vacation time. We get in this second room which at first glance seems to be cleaner and in better working order. We go about our day trying to enjoy the pool which by now is filled to capacity with nowhere to sit. We won\u2019t discuss the issue with the pool towels and the policy on getting a clean one. Suffice to say, bring your own detergent. We go get lounge chairs and take them down to the beach where finally we can start to relax on our vacation. That night, my daughter goes to make her bed on the pull out couch only to find that she has no pillows. We only had three undersized flat pillows on our bed so we call down and ask for three more pillows. Two were to be used by my daughter and another one for me since a recent surgery requires I maintain a certain posture. This usually isn't a problem with most resorts. At any rate, I wait up fully dressed, listening to what seems like the loudest air conditioner on the planet and smelling something rotten emanating from the AC closet, so that I can answer the door when the pillows arrive. That of course never happened. I woke up fully dressed still waiting on pillows the next morning. We called down to the front desk another two or three times that day asking for pillows, only to be told that the maid or runner said she left them in the room (we were in the room \u2013 no one came). My daughter assured the front desk that we did not receive pillows, but was treated very rudely and suspiciously by staff again. Finally after hours of waiting and fussing with staff my husband and I went down to the beach. I won\u2019t even go into the third degree the man at the wristband counter gave me when I tried to get wristbands for the pool area for day two. Apparently you have to put the hospital like disposable wristbands on loosely enough to take them off when you are not at the pool are (which for my husband is impossible) or wear the hideous red thing for however long your stay is, because they are only going to give you one. At any rate, my daughter calls me shortly after we leave the room to tell me, much to my horror and utter disbelief, that staff sent a runner to search our room. That was it! That was all the abuse I was going to take from these over puffed, over inflated, pompous you know what's, so I went to talk to management face to face. I calmly, because you get more flies with honey, asked for the manager in charge and was greeted by a very friendly young lady who assured me that they would be dealing with the runner who had the audacity to search a guest\u2019s room. I explained part of the ordeal that we had been put through over the past couple of days and she seemed sympathetic. She told me to expect a phone call from a Robert somebody within the next couple of days. That never happened. I asked for corporation\u2019s phone number on day one from a staff member at the front desk, but found that when I tried to call it, it was a bogus number! We checked out before 10:00 a.m. on our scheduled departure day. We could not wait to say good riddance to the so highly rated pathetic excuse of a resort. We all vowed to let anyone who asked us about the place know exactly what happened and what we thought. We vowed to NEVER AGAIN visit Wyndham's Ocean Walk Daytona. You would think the mistreatment would stop there, but nooo. Low and behold, when I got my credit card statement you will never guess what they did. You would expect that after knowing what their staff did to our family or how crappy and out of shape the rooms were that they put us in, they would give us a small discount, but noooo. They charged us for an extra room and I have been given nothing but the run around for going on two weeks trying to get it off my credit card! I\u2019ve called the direct line of the gentleman that I booked the vacation with but he said he can\u2019t do anything about it because it was a charge that the hotel or resort or whatever they claim to be, put on my card. I talked to several people at the resort before getting a hold of a manager or assistant manager who requested a copy of my credit card statement (of which I emailed her over a week ago). She stated that she would call me back the next day. But you know that never happened either! I\u2019ve left her voicemail after voicemail, but all I hear are crickets. I have been reduced to disputing the charge on my credit card. My next stop, other than letting everyone under the sun know how miserable a state the resort is in and how absolutely despicable the staff members are, is to make a complaint with their local better business bureau, and the Central Florida Visitors bureau. Innocent law abiding citizens such as myself (who also happens to be a War Veteran) and my family members should not be subjected to having their only vacations ruined by such conglomerates.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ocala, Florida", "Title": "\u201cSeen it's better days--but still is a great place\u201d", "Author": "dieljca", "ReviewID": "UR66255760", "Content": "We go to Ocean Walk a couple of times a year.

The resort needs to buy more luggage carts. I waited twenty minutes for one to use.There are porters if you wish to let them do it for you on a tips basis.Tips are discretionary. The room itself was very comfortable.We were in the South tower on the 13th floor,directly on the ocean.Our balcony view was fabulous! The king bed was comfy and Wyndham offerred all the comforts of home.In fact,after the 4th day,it began too feel like home.There was a jacuzzi tub,washer and dryer,safe,ironing board,iron,full kitchen with dishwasher,all utensils,cookware and table settings etc...Wyndham thoughtfully supplied laundry soap,diswasher soap and much more throughout the unit.The units are also solid,quiet and very private.No noise once the doors are closed. The staff were all pleasant and efficient.We had two minor problems (thermostat and kitchen sink sprayer handle) with the unit while we were there and both were taken care of promptly.The location is perfect for partying or just doing nothing.Wyndham has \"'won us over\" to Ocean Walk.We know the Daytona Beach area very well and have been going there for years.It's not as swank and ritzy as the Hilton which is right next door,but it certainly is much more family friendly.You'll save big $$$ by just making a trip to the local Publix supermarket and cooking for yourself while you are there.Ocean Walk is NOT for those who want to pay out wads to be pampered.If that's what you want,go to the Plaza,Hilton or The Shores resort and spa.Ocean Walk was never designed to be a five star,full service resort.It is what it is.At best it is four stars because it lacks room service and a sit down restaurant.Ocean Walk has the best pool deck/tiki bar on the beach.Security is excellent.Parking is free in the secure garage.Electronic key card entrance to all ways in.Kid zone,PC zone for kids.Private billiards room with PC access for adults only! Gym,lap pool,lazy river,water slide,three hot tubs, indoor pools,dvd rentals,in-hotel store (prices are atrocious!).Sit down breakfast from the grill, bar with tvs in the lobby...and so much more.Wireless PC access in all lobbies.No wireless plan for the rooms yet! But it is coming soon.That and the fact that they do not hand out freshly laundered towels on a daily basis to pool goers were the only real negatives that we spotted.The answers were obvious for us:we were on vacation at one of the best resorts at \"The world's most famous beach\"! Why in the world did we need to have PC access in our rooms? The weather was perfect (There is premium cable TV available in all rooms as well as dvd players and a blockbuster rental kiosk on the LL level). The thing with the towels was equally obvious.It cost us nothing but a few minutes' time to launder them in our rooms every other day.Bring your own towels if you do not want to pay $15 if the resort towels that are allocated to you are lost. If things like this bother you,then you probably don't need to go to Ocean Walk.It's all about fun there!

During our stay the pools were fine, could have been a little warmer but swimmable. The resort is great because you can walk to things if you want (great location) and you really don't have to leave unless you want. pools were clean enough although the toddler pool could have been a little cleaner. Check in/ check out was no problem, although we were doing it at days/times that weren't real busy. I did see a lot of people in line at busy times. The \"market\" was great for breakfast and the drinks at the pool bar, while pricey, are very good. The only real negative I have about this resort would be service, but not with the people. I think a resort should make it as easy as possible for people to \"do things\". Example: we need a dolly to take the groceries up to the 19th floor. I have to go all the was to the \"sun center\" (or whatever it is called), leave my ID, go out to the car, get my stuff, go to the room, go all the back to the place to return the dolly.

The resort had no vacancy at this time according to the desk but did not seem crowded at anytime (may have been the weather). We had no trouble checking in, the biggest problem I had was deciding which floor I would like my room on. The entire process took approx. 5 minutes before my room keys were in hand. We had an oceanview room in the North tower (3 bedroom,very spacious 5th floor), it was a room that has not been updated yet but was very nice and clean. We did ask mid way through our stay see a two bedroom in the South tower to see what the resorts updated rooms looked like - very nice new color scheme and flat screen lcd Tv's. There is no longer a Spa in the resort, they advertise for one two blocks up the street and WiFi is currently still only available in the lobby but this is supposed to change in the next few months. The Ocean Walk shops next door offer several restaurants/bars, a few shops and a Movie 10 theatre. You could walk over through the 4th floor of the South Tower and then over to the Hilton through the Ocean Walk Shops without going into the rain. The Hilton has some lunch and dinner speacials at their restaurants worth checkingout. The lazy river was not heated while we were there so we did not use it. The pools were a nice temp. for the time of year as were the hot tubs. Did not use either of the two indoor pools or the children's pool with playground but checked and the children's area was heated. Security around the hotel was always present, although I found it odd to have the person at the front chasing you down for your parking ticket as you had to use a room key for entrance to the garage. I could see having them there to keep people from parking and blocking off the entrance to the garage which seemd to be occuring at check in as ther is no space for temp parking. There are lots of activities for both children and adults if they wished to particpate, including yoga classes, indoor mini putt, socials -wine and cheese, ice cream and different games. Yopu could signed out board games to take to your room at the activities desk and sign up for computer time. There is also a business center for adults separate from the time limit computers. The units were well socked with appliances, utensils, starter dish and laundry soap. The pillows were comfortable but could be larger (twin pillows on a king bed). The bed was okay for comfort, I have slept in better and I have slept in worse. Overall,we enjoyed our stay, the Ocean Walk is a very nice resort. It was clean, and I found the majority of the staff friendly and helpful, they accomadated our requests as best they could and went out of their way on occasion - we were unable to see the one bedroom rooms at the resort due to no vacancy but they did give us a key to see the two bedroom that was being updated. I can not comment on price as we are Wyndham points owners and used our points. I would return to this hotel with our children in the future.

Booking was a little confusing, as I didn't fully realize that I was essentially renting someone's timeshare. Whatever, I'm not picky that way. Picked out a one-bedroom deluxe oceanfront. Arrived around 8:30 PM, no problems checking in. Go up to my room, it's as advertised, looks very nice, clean, beautiful ocean view. Then I step onto the carpet. It squishes under my feet. Investigate further, water is on the tile floor by the toilet and the carpet where it meets the tile is soaked. Determine it's clean water, decide to leave well enough alone. By the next evening it's dry. Layout of the room is nice, everything was clean, kitchen was very well provisioned (I could have made waffles!), beautiful whirlpool tub and big shower. Even had packets of laundry detergent to use in the washer and dryer. Absolutely no complaints except for the standing water. Only other odd thing was that every window and the sliding glass door were all unlocked. The strike plate for the door was also loose. Fixed those things myself. I'm an engineer; I couldn't leave it like that... Go get my \"Welcome Packet\" the next evening and learn it's a marketing ploy to get you to listen to a timeshare sales pitch. Fortunately I'm busy all day every day and the nice lady behind the counter was not pushy. At this point I learn that the only food available here is vending machines or the glorified convenience store that is only open in the morning and early afternoon. Good thing the Ocean Walk Village is right next door. Come back to the room, flip open my laptop, start looking for Internet access. No joy. Only place it's available is in the lobby, but I could sit anywhere and it was free, just like the parking. Even though it was only about 50 degrees Fahrenheit outside the next morning, the outdoor pool was like a bathtub. Lazy river, etc. was all in working order. Wonderful! There was always a security guard out front and usually in the pool area. I never felt unsafe, even when walking back late at night. That may have been because the oceanfront was completely dead due to cold weather, etc. On the last day, I needed to store my suitcase while I attended the conference. It took an inordinate amount of time to locate a bellman to put my bag in the \"closet.\" When he did finally show up, he did not have any claim tickets with him and just handed me a piece of paper with a couple of details as my \"ticket.\" As a result of all this I was ten minutes late to the meeting. Go back to pick it up, again, no bellman, walk back with the maintenance guy to get my back from the \"closet.\" It was an unused meeting room at the back corner of the hotel. It was not locked. This whole process took nearly 20 minutes. Ended up scrambling to make my return flight. Fortunately I only had to go back to DAB and not MCO. So, long story short, it's a beautiful hotel with a nice swimming area, but not much else. It is a great location, though.

When I made the reservation to stay here, I didn't realize I was booking the best resort in the area! This place has everything! The check in was a little different. They are a timeshare resort, so after you check in, you have to go to this seperate desk to get your \"welcome packet\" where they try to schedule you for a tour. Yes, they do give you something for taking a tour, but we weren't interested. They were pushy for a moment but backed off. They only other complaints we had were you had to leave your license if you wanted to use a luggage cart, check out pool towels and if they weren't returned to the desk at the end of your stay you'd be charged $15 per towel and had to check out a pack n play. We used the luggage cart at the end of our stay and used bell service to get everything up to our room. Was well worth it since the rooms weren't close to where we checked in, We didn't check out pool towels since we were afraid we'd forget and leave them in our room, plus we already had our own. The other complaint was in the bedroom was a window leading to the hall. Although they had mini blinds up, the room was still quite lit up. We didn't have a problem with people walking by since we were towards the end of the hall, but was still weird having a window there. Would like to have seen black out curtains at least. Our room was on the 18th floor and couldn't have had a better view! You could sit on the couch in the living room and it felt like you were on a cruise ship....I look out the window to the balcony and could only see ocean! Can't get much better than that! The kitchen was adequate with everything we needed. We were able to go to the grocery store and get a few items to cook in our room. After that, we never left the property! There was no need. The pools were awesome!! Great kids pool, lazy river, etc. Beach was just right there so you could spend your day lounging from the beach to the pool, etc. Restaurants that were on property were pretty good as well.

The room was beautifully decorated and very clean. The jacuzzi tub was an added bonus. The large stand up shower was relaxing. Everything about the room was great, the only thing we wished we had was opening windows in the bedroom so we could hear the ocean better at night. The central air was very efficient. Full kitchen ammenities and the washer/dryer were great to have. The hotel itself is a self contained community with every ammenity at your fingers. The basement floor has a inground pool, yoga studio, fitness center, childrens play center, billiards game room, computer center and more. There is a miniature golf course on the 4th floor. Ground level has a inground pool, eatery and bar. Outdoor pool area was incredible! Every morning we floated around the lazy river for awhile and then jumped in the pools and took great advantage of the water slide. I especially appreciated that the pools are 6ft deep in parts .... I know that in Orlando you are lucky to find a pool that gets to 5ft deep! Oh, and I'd like to add that the outdoor pools were NOT overly chlorinated! Infact, it was the cleanest and least chlorinated pool I have ever swam in. The indoor pools however, though very warm and inviting, did sting your nose and eyes a bit. It is a 1 minute walk from the pool area to \"OceanWalk\", where there are a variety of eateries, shops and even a 3 story movie theater! (The theater was awesome, seats were very comfortable). Across the street is a water park and indoor fun park. The water park was to our dismay closed for the season during our stay. We loved this hotel and can't wait to go back! It was the most relaxing vacation ever .... from the comforts of the room, to the magnitude of activites within walking distance ... from the refreshing pools to swimming in the warm ocean and walks along the beach, from Starbucks every morning to Coldstone IceCream for afternoon dessert .... and sitting at the maitai bar under the tiki torches and watching electric storms over the ocean .... absolutely amazing!", "Date": "October 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Upstate SC", "Title": "\u201cNice play to stay only a few surprises.\u201d", "Author": "MomofTeensSC", "ReviewID": "UR46922504", "Content": "We went on the trip for part business/part family trip.

We were told it wasn't a problem the 1st space would be complimentary and the 2nd space was $10. What we didn't find out until we arrived was that only 1 of the 2 would be in the Wyndam Parking Garage. The 2nd space was across the street in the public parking garage. Not a huge deal, but a little aggravating when we all left to go somewhere. Then there was the luggage carts... if you want one, be prepared to give the attendant at the carts your driver's license. You won't get a cart unless you do. Again, not a big deal, but not too crazy about having to leave the license to get a cart. And finally, we did not know that they didn't have housekeeping come in unless you call and request (not a big deal though, I prefer people not running in and out of my room unless I'm there anyway). But we did find out after asking about getting additional clean towels that we had to wash the ones we had.(there was a stackable W/D in the suite). Again, not too big of a deal, but just wasn't informed. Pools could have used a vaccuum a little more but not bad. Overall it was a great place. Not complaining about these things just informing you of things we did not know at first. I did love the place. It was very well kept, staff was friendly, on site store and eating options.

Upon driving 15 hours and checking in, I had to wait for over an hour and a half to catch an elevator from the parking garage to our floor. That was ridiculous. 2. The pool policy of confiscating all our stuff after 30 minutes is horrible. I was swimming with two children and we decided to get out of the pool. We got to our chair only to discover all our stuff was missing. It took me 15 minutes of searching out \"security\" guards to find out that they threw it all in a trash bag. This is a horrible, horrible policy for a \"family\" resort. Do you really expect people to just lay out and sunbathe and not get in the pools without constantly running back to security and \"checking in\" to make sure all their stuff doesn't vanish. It's a damn good thing I didn't have my wallet, cell phone or any valuables with me that day. 3. The utensils in the room were sub-par. We had to make due with a pizza cutter that was broken. The only pot in the room held about 2 cups of water and there were no baking pans at all. I have stayed at many different resorts through time share trades and this one was the worst stocked kitchen I have ever seen and it wasn't even close. 4. The door on the second bedroom of the unit we had wouldn't even close because of swelling or it was improperly hung. 5. The shower in the main bedroom wasn't very clean upon check in. It wasn't filthy, but it also looked like it hadn't be truly cleaned in a few weeks. 6. The pool area was roped off every morning for cleaning. We walked on the beach to see the sunrise one morning and security wouldn't let us walk through the pool area to access the beach. We had to walk through the resort down to the South exit to get to the beach. For a resort that is \"on the beach\" that is another horrible policy. 7.

The concept was good to have them, but they were very nasty to small children and patrolled things that didnt need it and things that did need to be addressed were over looked. You were suppose to wear wrist bands but again security picked and choose who they would check. We rented from a VRBO and room was ok. No sheets on pull out and we were told we had to ask owners, blender didnt work, little things like that.We did voice our concerns to the front desk but they were simply ignored. One staff member did agree with me that the security guards were very nasty but again that went no where. Over all huge dissapointment and we have decided our last visit to Daytona.

We had a washer and dryer, as well as a full kitchen. While it is true that there were not many towels, doing laundry was no trouble at all. You could start it in the morning when you got up, throw stuff in the dryer, and have it be done when you got back from the beach. The pools were great, and the beach was lovely. We brought our own beach towels from home, and bought a cheap umbrella for 20 bucks. The food poolside was a tad expensive (9 bucks for a burger and fries) but hey, thats hotel food for you. I really enjoyed the activites the hotel had during our stay. We went to karaoke 3 times, water aerobics 2x, and hip hop aerobics! They also had a pirate and princess party that my 5 yr old niece enjoyed, and a hoola hoop contest my 9 yr old niece competed in. My son has autism and had a great time with the pools and the ocean, which was a great relief to us. Our hotel room never felt crowded. I do agree that the elevator situation is a complete joke. We stayed in the North Tower, which had 25 floors. One bank of elevators (4 total) is not nearly enough. I also don't understand why there isn't hotel wide wi-fi.

I rented a one-bedroom condo at the Ocean Walk from Daytona Ocean Rentals (DBA Cindy Grutza). The room was filthy! The bed linens were stained (both the set of linens on the bed and the back-up set) and the blanket had cigarette burns in it, even though the room was supposed to be non-smoking. The night stand and kitchen table both had sticky soda stains all over their surfaces. And the last renter's toiletries were still in the bathroom (someone's used razors, dirty hair brush. old Ziploc bags and tampon wrappers are not my idea of cleanliness). It was a complete nightmare. To top it all off, the view from the balcony had been deliberately misrepresented. It looks as though Daytona Ocean Rentals took a picture of the view from a few floors above this condo and cropped the photo so you don't realize until you arrive that your view is 100% obstructed. Yes -- the entire hotel is between your room and the ocean. And with wall-to-wall windows along each internal hallway, all 20-something floors can see you while you try to relax on your balcony. I work in marketing; I know exactly how and why the picture was cropped like it was. To make matters even worse, Daytona Ocean Rentals overcharged me $560! They promised to refund the unused portion of our stay because of these problems (which is the only reason we checked out early; otherwise we would have purchased our own sheets and stuck it out). But when I got home from vacation later in the week, I received a handwritten note (oh yeah, she's that professional) saying she had changed her mind and would not be refunding our money. I have never in my entire life had a hotel or a merchant rip me off. It is the most frustrating experience I have ever had and I would never want another person to have to endure this. In an economy like this where people are struggling, I find it disgusting that there are hotels and rental companies who are trying to take advantage of people to make an extra buck.

Though we already had our yearly Daytona Beach reservations in place we began to research the possibility of changing our plans and surprising our boys. Many hours were spent in search of an affordable room and reading different reviews. Even though some reviews made us second guess our change, we truly believed it would be the greatest vacation ever. Well, you decide! We arrived to a traffic and check-in nightmare even though we were allowed an early (2:00 pm) check-in. During check-in we were given blue armbands to wear during our stay. I have no problem with the armband if you can remove it before going out and if everyone else wears theirs while at the resort. If worn as supposedly required you make a good target for those looking to cash in on vacationers. Our unit (606) was an owner unit and it only had five bath towels. Our rental didn\u2019t provide housekeeping so we were required to do our own laundry. So, with 5 bath towels we were basically doing laundry every day. I would recommend using the dryer while out of the unit due to the \u201cjet engine\u201d sound it makes while running. Lounge chairs were hard to come by. In order to get a chair you had to wait in lobby along with lots of other guests until 8:15 when pool area was opened and race to a chair. So, forget sleeping in. Also, be prepared to wait in line just to get in the lazy river. People aren\u2019t allowed in it without a tube which is usually hard to come by. No \u201cbody floating\u201d is allowed. On second day, buses, vans, and more buses arrive with youth groups attending a youth convention. Resort was overtaken by teenagers. People would \u201cknock and run\u201d on door and windows at all hours of the day and night. Elevators which required patience anyway were basically inaccessible when youth groups came in. The joke was to press all 20 plus buttons so it would stop at all floors all the time. If you pick this resort we recommend checking the Daytona Convention Center events calendar before booking. On third day, air conditioning in parts of the south tower quit working. Air conditioning was not restored for approximately 30 hours. Our 85 degree room was abandoned for an entire day. We were lucky to have family at a nearby resort so we spent the day with them. Resort management was very unprofessional, unfriendly, and unaccommodating about the whole ordeal.

Ours had a lovely view of the hallway too, which we were told it had a riverview, but I guess it did if you opened your blinds and looked through the hall out the back of the place. But who wants to open their windows into a hallway where everyone can look in your room as they pass??? There were no overhead lights either. All you had were lamps so it looked like a dungeon. Also, the first night we were there, the air conditioners on the entire 13th floor were out. We called repeatedly to the front desk and all we were told is we were on a waiting list. I finally asked to speak to a manager and she said there was nothing they could do. Meanwhile, my 4 year old daughter was pouring in sweat in her sleep in our 1304B dungeon.

Unit 2222AB is actually 2 one bedroom units that have a door in the middle that connect the 2 into a Two bedroom unit.

The unit was stocked with adequate dishes and pots and pans making meal prep convenient. The King Bed in the master bedroom was VERY comfortable. Definately a high quality mattress. The 2 double mattresses in the other bedroom was worn and one even sagged in the middle. THe towels were also high quality. THe condo contained shampoo, soap, dish detergent, bath foam. The resort DOES NOT have ice machines. Be sure to turn ON your ice machine in the condo freezers if you want ice. The resort does have a lot of activities for all ages. Women be sure to take advantage of their $5 Spa package on Tuesday at 1:30. It is quit the bargain for the price. It is actually a beauty control consultant promoting their spa products but you get to try a lot of stuff and it is in a very spa like environment. For $5 you get a warm neck wrap, instant manicure, facial, dark circle/eye treatment, foot treatments and seveal other pampering items. It is very well worth your $5 and a 80 minutes of pleasant treatment. I would recommend this unit to anyone, while it could stand some DEEP cleaning, it was suitable.

You walk out the back of the resorts past the pool, out the gate (you need your room key to get back in) and poof, you are on the beach! This was the best part of being at the resort - plus it's in a no-vehicle-on-the-beach area. There are also beach vendors selling food and drink (cheaper than the pool bar). We did have a few problems with the room - hole in the wall, no towels, missing doorknob on guest BR door, shower door off track in Master BR, wet carpet, broken toaster, and, our favorite, a pair of kid's underwear from the previous guests found in the living room! They did resolve all the items we reported on the first day (toaster and underwear happened later in the week, and we just didn't want to bother). Activities center was very nice - went for an ice cream social and to paint ceramics. Reasonably priced. No internet access in the room itself. Wireless was available down in the business center. They also had computers there that you could use. Also access to a printer to be able to print boarding passes. Beware of the hair weave people at the resort. They charge $2 per inch for the hair wrap. She wrapped at least 2 inches longer than my niece's hair, and it started to come undone where it wasn't wrapped around the hair. She did fix it that same day, but the wrap should have been 2 inches shorter (and $4 cheaper) in the first place. Shopping - there is a souvenir shop called Oceanic Gifts on N. Atlantic, 2 shops north of Main St. Prices here were very reasonable, good selection, friendly staff. The one that's across the street from the resort (I don't remember the name), I would not recommend. They do the iron-on designs, and after 1 washing, the decal on one of the two shirts purchased already started to come off. They were also kind of pushy. Bottom line - the location of this resort really overrides the issues we had with the room. They were all minor issues, but the fact that there were so many of them made it seem worse. If we had the opportunity to stay here again, we probably would, despite the problems.", "Date": "May 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "duluth, mn", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place for any age person!\u201d", "Author": "band", "ReviewID": "UR29346619", "Content": "We just got back from our second week stay - one week in March and one in April.

Finally another maintance worker came up, told us they have had numerous issues with this room and the front desk should have never rented it out. They finally gave us another room. Another issue was we never had wash rags, asked for those twice finally gave up. Kitchen was missing several items that were in our other room. Rooms were not consistent with anything!

We kept checking to see if our room was done and at 1:45 were finally told that our room wouldn't be ready until sometime after 4pm (we had been \"assigned\" room 515 in the South Tower since our booking months ago). They quickly relocated us to 527 in the North Tower (corner ocean front unit) so we could move all our stuff in. Upon entering our room, I quickly noticed grey painted footprints in front of the balcony doors and issues with the lamps in the living room. It was obvious that someone had recently painted the balcony, got paint on his shoes and stepped into the condo. You could track his movements turning around to close the balcony doors. I also noticed that the carpet leading from the master bedroom into the bath area had pulled up. This was reported to the front desk and I was informed that the carpet issues couldn't be corrected during my stay. No big deal since we were all adults and could watch our step. The rest of the condo was beautifully decorated with a table in the entranceway, a couch, two chairs, endtables, coffee table, entertainment center and TV in the living room, a dining table with 6 chairs and a eat-in bar attached to the kitchen counter with 3 or 4 more chairs. There was also a VHS player which was kind of funny to me since all other Wyndham resorts have DVD players. Good thing I always travel with our portable DVD player! The master bedroom had a king sized bed, 2 nightstands and a dresser with TV. The bed wasn't a comfortable as mine at home, but I didn't have any trouble sleeping at night! The dresser needs to be replaced though. The master bath had a two sink vanity, standup shower and whirlpool tub with a separate room with the toilet. The second bedroom had two double beds with a night stand between them and a dresser and TV. The rest of the resort was BEAUTIFUL!! I LOVED the colorful \"boardwalk\" with sun. The streets of Daytona had similar street artwork at all the intersections (fish, shells etc). The accessibility to the beach was WONDERFUL. We never used the pools or hottubs as we spent all our time on the beach. You walked right by the poolside bar (sold drinks and lunches), down the steps to the boardwalk and right onto the beach. The view from our condo was great too each morning and evening looking right over the large expanse of beach. The location of this resort was great too! With the Ocean Walk shops/restaurants etc right there it was easy to get my starbucks addiction satisfied each morning. We ate at Bubba Gumps too but could also walk to many (of varying price) places to eat. Right across the street is the Starlight, just down the road is Burger King and Hog Heaven BBQ (GREAT). We ordered pizza a couple of evenings (a MUST with teenagers).

Unfortunately, the weather in Daytona was not cooperative- it was in the low 60's all weekend. However, we got an opportunity to walk around the property to see what the Wyndham had to offer. Let me be the first to tell you- if you have a family with children, this is THE place to stay. The pool is divided into different sections. They have a lazy river, a kid's water slide, kids play area, and a regular pool. They also have an indoor pool and schedule lots of activities throughout the day for guests and kids. On Saturday night, we walked by the pool and saw they were showing a movie at the indoor pool! There is a game room, computer room, and kids craft room. We were not able to locate a restaurant within the hotel. Either we didn't find it, or they don't have one. My wife and I stayed in a 1 bedroom room. There was plenty of space with a full kitchen. It would have been nice if we had an oceanview room, but we were okay with the view of the Daytona strip. There were two things that were \"red flags\" about the Wyndham: 1) The elevators kept breaking down! Fortunately we weren't inside one when it happened! 2) There were people in the lobby wearing shirts that said \"I made a HUGE mistake BUYING here, it would be cheaper to RENT.\" Obviously the Wyndham sells timeshares. But, seeing those people in the lobby was somewhat of an annoyance (in my opinion). Overall, we definitely look forward to going back to the Wyndham.

We had friends who were generous enough to let us buy a week of time, points, or whatever you call it in a time share system. We were very impressed with the place. CONS: Everywhere you turn you are propositioned to attend tiimeshare sales pitches. Depending on your position you may want to consider it. We were offered $80 in dinner funds. We weren't buying, shopped at the local Publix grocery store (excellent!), and didn't want to spend the time, so we declined. Our room, though v ery nice, was in an interior hallway which was really weird because the only two windows (living area and bedroom) in the place overlooked an interior hallway, which meant anyone walking past could look at you like a zoo exhibit. The draw shades were light-proof, and we kept them down the entirety of our stay. We had no natural light when we were in the room. The view from the hallway was of the Halifax river and what we though may be downtown Daytona. Nice view, but it was a weird environment, as such. If you can do so, book an oceanfront room. The couch bed in our room was really filthy from food stains. We covered it with the extra blanket and sheets in the room in order to sit on it.. We reported this to the hotel. The sign on the outside hot tub says something like \"children under 12 are permitted with supervision.\" Supervision for some parents is if you are within one-quarter mile. We thought there should be a ban on children in the hot tub altogether. We left twice because of the little rugrats (we raised ours, and don't care to have to watch those of strangers). The resort apparently does not recycle. We're not tree huggers, but we have recycled for years, and I cringed every time I had to put glass and plastics with the rest of the trash into the trash chute. But hey, that's just me The weekend we were there, there was a large adolescent youth group staying there. They held the elevators open, which were usually not a problem as far as waiting, were shreiking in only the pitch that adolescent girls can achieve, took over the pool/hot tub area in the evening, and pretty much stole one night of relaxation from us. This was a disappointment that the resort would rent to such a gaggle of hormonal youth, but they did. We didn't see an adult with these kids. We were glad to hear so many other guests express their dismay with this group, as we thought we may be the only ones. Even the lobby/bar area wasn't exempt from the noise of this group. It took an evening from us. We were not happy. PROS: **THE SERVICE IS EXCELLENT** One of the high points I found, was that I was willing to look foolish enough to walk through the interior hall with my laptop computer on and found a wireless internet access about 20 yards from our room, which was a **MAJOR BONUS* * iff you were willing to stand at a window with your computer. I was. Internet access is available in the lobby, but if you want to search for it, you may find it closer to your room. We had a few problems with our room: The TV in the living/sitting area didn't work. Two lamps in sitting area didn't work. We called, and within 90 minutes this was taken care of. Problems may be considered a \"con,\" but the time it took to fix them put them in the \"pro\" category. One evening at 12:30 a.m. we realized our air conditioning quit working. A call to the front desk (they asked if we wanted it now or if we were willing to wait until the morning.... it was Florida, we weren't!) brought a maintenance staffer to our room in less than an hour, and the problem was fixed. We were quite impressed. The fact that the resort issues beach towels is a plus for guests who are flying to this destination, as they are heavy in a suitcase. There is an inside lobby with a bar that offers different theme evenings for those that imbibe, or just like a good time. There was a wine and cheese evening, a martini evening, and a karaoke evening for all you singers. If you enjoying socializing, this is a great venue. There was never a search for beach chairs. There were always unused beach chairs, and tables and chairs. If you're willing to pay the price, there is a restaurant/store in the lobby area that has *great* pizza, and good food, beer and wine available to purchase, along with just about anything else you might need, such as suntan lotions and a smattering of souveniers and clothing. I can't speak for all the beds in all the units, but we had a king size pillow top mattress that compared to our home mattress, which was so very comfortable. Not that we're willing to buy into timeshare, but if we were we wouldn't think twice about this one. Thinking about staying here?

We booked a condo rental through RCI for about $300 (through the military vacation packages). We arrived near midnight (left home late) and their front desk was open and very helpful. We were told to go by the customer service desk after 9am to pick up our wristbands for the pool and our \"welcome gift\". Of course we knew we would be hit up for buying a timeshare after reading the other reviews but we needed the wristbands, so we went. The staff was deceptive in trying to get us into their timeshare presentations, saying it was a \"survey\" to get our feedback. My husband told them he might or might not be available but they signed him up anyway. We got a free totebag and frisbee but never went to their presentation. Staff seemed overly pushy to sell timeshares and we even heard one griping to another about someone not buying one when we passed him in the hall, but after check-in we didn't have any issues with being pressed to buy a timeshare. Other than that, this place is top notch! Parking was great - there is a parking garage with easy access to the elevators. Luggage carts are few and far between but we carried our own luggage anyway. The room was impeccable - we had room 1915 which is a condo on the top floor corner. It had a master bed, 2 guest beds and a couch with a pull out bed. We had a few minor inconveniences (like the accordion door coming off on the pantry, and the light in the guest bedroom was out but we didn't use that room anyway). Other than those few minor things, it was great. It had a huge jacuzzi tub, 2 TVs, balcony with a beach view (which was not locked by the way - it looks like their outside renovations are complete). We had everything we needed - paper towels, dish soaps, pots and pans, dishes, vacuum - everything was provided. Downstairs they have a fitness center that looked nice, but I was disappointed to find all the treadmills occupied in the morning so I ran on the beach instead. There is an indoor pool which I saw only about 2 people in the entire time. There's a computer area with WIFI (no interenet connections in the rooms - BOO!!!). There was a nice looking childrens area where they can do crafts. They have activities which we didn't try, but heard someone complaining on the elevator that Bingo was only for timeshare owners, so be aware of that. We didn't swim in the outdoor pools but they looked very nice (if only a little dirty on the bottom at times, as seen from our balcony). We floated in the lazy river almost daily and it was nice. There is security everywhere (in front of the hotel and in the pool area) so we felt safe at all times. Be aware that there is a large entertainment area with stage right outside near the beach on what appears to be separate property. They had a loud concert on Saturday night until about 10 pm - it would be a problem for early sleepers on a lower floor (we could hear it all the way up on the 19th floor). There is a small \"shopping\" area attached that has a Quizno's and Coldstone Creamery but it's not good for much else. You can walk right out to it from the 4th floor.

When you finally catch an elevator, be prepared to squeeze in with wet, smelly beach-goers and LOTS of kids. Next problem. The pool. The pool area is an absolute mad house - crowded, not enough chairs, not that clean, noisy - total chaos all the time. Next problem - the neighborhood. I knew Daytona was a little sketchy, but I did not expect this level of sleaze. You'll share restaurants and walks with bums and faux-bikers and roving gangs of teenagers. Be aware.

That was not so awesome. Overall, we had a great time at Ocean Walk! I have TWO PIECES OF ADVICE..... 1. If you leave the parking garage, you better be back before the dinner crowd gets back....otherwise you'll be pressed for a space. We had to go to the other tower to find a space on two nights and had to go all the way to the top! It took FOREVER! 2. EAT AT BOONDOCKS! It's down A-1 headed towards Daytona Shores.

Our check-in process was a breeze and the staff couldn't have been more polite. We arrived early and our unit was ready and we were able to check in about 3 hours early. We were in a great 2 bedroom unit which was huge and the view amazing. It was clean, well stocked and everything in working order. We moved our car only a handful of times during the week because everything is right there to include restaurants, movies, shopping, ice cream, pizza, etc. The pools can be a little crowded like most resorts but you always have the beach and access is right there. This resort has something for everyone, young and old, couples or families.", "Date": "July 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cGoing Downhill\u201d", "Author": "kymotherof2", "ReviewID": "UR17643682", "Content": "Have stayed at this resort several times, but this time was the absolute worst.

The pool inside I wish they would turn the heat up on the water. It was pretty chilly. I also wish they had a hot tub indoors because the last 3 years we have been there we didn't use hot tubs as there were nothing but a bunch of teenagers in it goofing until they closed down for the night. I think Adults should be able to swim and be in hottub at own risk of course, after hours. Us adults are unable to enjoy these amenitys when there are teens around goofing off and the pools are packed with splashing children and so on. Don't get me wrong I have children as well but it would be great to be able to go out late at night for a nice, QUIET swim. They could also use a few more elevators at the size of this place there should be 8 instead of 4. Elevator wait time at times is horriable.

I am an early riser and got them, but did not enjoy having to stand in a line until 8:15, then actually run/race with others to get chairs where we wanted them.

Everything was very clean and the one issue of no linens for the sofa bed was remedied very promptly. The staff were great from the beginning to the end. Brigette checked us in and was very friendly.

The pools were great, especially since that was what really drew us to this property. The kiddie pool was closed for what looked like serious maintenance when we arrived, but we were pleasantly surprised to find it open on the second day. The pool decks were crowded and chairs were hard to come by, but we spent most of our time swimming anyway, so we didn't really care that chairs weren't available. Drinks at the poolside bar were pricey, but no restrictions on bringing your own from your room. The poolside bar even had cups available for you so that you didn't bring glass poolside! Having restaurants within walking distance was great - we didn't move our car for three days! We walked to the pier, the boardwalk (what is left of it anyway), the arcade/mini golf/ waterpark across the street, and the shopping/dining area next door.

My husband and I have two little girls and my vacation is from about 6:30am-7am with a cup of coffee on the balcony. THAT is why I save all my hard-earned money over the year - to give the kids a great week and have a little mom-time on the balcony in the morning with my cup of joe. So we get to the hotel where I've booked a 2-bedroom suite. My worst fear - no balcony at all. If you get the fifth floor - #516 or higher, you will have no balcony, further, no opening windows. Your view will be the top of the OceanWalk shopping center and trash (including beer bottles and cigarette butts) from the balconies above you. It's hideous. Wyndham and OceanWalk would be better off taking all of those units out of service and turning them into offices or the timeshare area. Those units are probably the bain of the front desk manager's existence. Every other person in those units griped to the front desk - all were told they couldn't be moved. We even offered to downgrade our room to a 1BR to get out of that 2-BR suite. Wyndham needs to understand that people are spending big money to travel. As we all get strapped from every end of our budget, we demand better value for our precious travel dollar. If I spend thousands for a week in Florida, I better at least have windows that open. OceanWalk was nice in almost every other way. The kids loved the pools, the beach and the kids area in the basement. We had overall good service - there were some glitches.

We stayed here before when it was owned and operated by Fairfield and had a great time with excellent service. This time was terrible, as far as service goes. First of all, when I booked the room (we had a large 2 bedroom, 2 bath unit) I asked specifically about the balcony situation because I was told by someone that their balconies were being worked on and that I might have a locked out balcony. The man on the phone became very rude, and I said, well, I might have to cancel the reservation and go somewhere that appreciates my business, he said \"that's your prerogative\". Poor attitude. Anyways, we decided to take the chance and keep the booking. When we arrived, I had to stand in 3 different lines to check in. They kept asking me how I booked it (internet, phone, etc.) Each time, I told them, I booked it through your reservation phone line. They kept telling me to go to a different line. After standing in line for 30 minutes, our room wasn't ready, so they gave us our wrist bands and off to the pool we went. We went to pick up our towels and were told that we only get 1 towel per person for the entire stay. Yep, that's right, no fresh towels after a long day of sunscreen and sand. We have to wash them ourselves in our unit if we want them to be clean. With Fairfield, we got to pick up fresh towels each morning. We went back 3 times to check and see if our room was ready. Finally, it was ready. When we get up there (20th floor) the maids are still in there cleaning. So, we wait for 30 minutes until they are finished. Then we leave for dinner and we come back and we are locked out of the room. We call downstairs to get security up there to let us in. We have a 3 year old and a 6 year old who have to use the restroom. We wait 25 minutes for them to come up and let us in and then the guy tells us we have to go back downstairs to get new keys made. Well, guess what, 2 out of the 4 elevators in our tower are broken. So, it literally takes 20 minutes to go down stairs and 20 minutes to come back up!!! People were cramming into these elevators, making alarms go off and people screaming at each other b/c it is overcrowded. Crazy. There was a fight that broke out in front of my 2 children on the elevator. Nothing was done about the elevator problem for 2 DAYS and the hotel was sold out!!! That is unacceptable to me. The next day we wake up to a beautiful GREEN pool. Disgusting. It was roped off and closed for 24 hours while they poured a thousand gallons of chlorine in the pool. The other pool was also disgusting. Bandaids, hair, snot, you name it, was floating around. I never did see anyone cleaning the pools and I was up late and up early. So, when the green pool was closed, you can imagine how crazy busy the other pool was. We go to complain about all of our poor service and guess what, we were given 2 complimentary breakfasts just like one of the pp stated. We went to use the complimentary breakfasts this morning on the day of checkout, you got it, no breakfast during the week. No one told us this, so again, we went to complain and we were told that a manager would call us ASAP. No call so far.

The unit is very large (maybe 1100 or 1200 square feet, not including the balcony) and had a double sized balcony that can be accessed from the living room or one of the bedrooms. The unit itself was clean and well appointed -- sofa, two large living room chairs, rectangular dining room table with six chairs and a counter attached to the kitchen with three chairs. The decor is very nice -- great colors and themes. One bedroom has a king size bed and the other features two double (54 inch) beds. Rooms were very clean although the bedspreads were a bit tired. Each bedroom features a television with cable. The kitchen has a microwave, stove, fridge, dishwasher, dishes and utensils. The kitchen was very clean and fairly large. The dishwasher was a bit balky. There are two bathrooms -- one with a double sink, shower and hot tub and the other a basic sink and tub. Everything was spotless. You have a small washer and dryer, which worked very well. They provide you with soap, dishwasher detergent, a couple of small laundry soap boxes, shampoo, conditioner, etc. There were lots of towels, but you will probably have to wash them if you are staying for a week. This is not a problem. You can go out and buy some additional laundry soap. You bus your own garbage to a shoot in the hall. The unit itself would earn a grade of \"A\" in my view. There are two outdoor pools, one indoor pool, a 'lazy river' ride (inner tubes pushed by a current around a circular water track) and an outdoor hot tub. The pool area features good security coverage (they will ask you to produce your access card or an arm band) and is busy at certain points in the day. Very nice setup. The beach is not really private as a previous reviewer indicated but it is in a pedestrian only area and there is easy access to the hotel pool area from the beach. There is a bar by the pool, which seemed to close its doors at a reasonably early time. The water was 75 degrees in the ocean but you are advised not to go out too far due to the current (waist deep). The staff at the front desk and in the hotel were friendly and helpful. There was a bit of construction work around the parking entrance area but this was not a big problem. You could enter the garage through a back entrance.

First, drove up to the front of the hotel just to find out about parking--the bellman/doorman must have been 100 years old and just didn't get that all we were trying to ask was where to park since our rooms weren't ready yet. Took like 5 mins for him just to tell us to go in the garage after giving us the 3rd degree about why we were there. After parking, the next encounter with staff was where the meeting rooms were. No one could explain how to get to the meeting area, and when we finally figured it out, the girl working that area was quite short and abrupt with us, not very willing to be helpful. Then, after our business was over we went to the front desk. What they don't tell you and don't have signage for, is that there is a separate check in area for owners or in our case, it was pre-arranged rooms for our compnay at the owners desk, so after standing in the regular line forever, we have to go to a different line. These front desk people were the SLOWEST and RUDEST people I have ever seen. They complained about their jobs and it took 2 people about 1 hour to check in 10 people, causing some in my group to be late for the next meeting. Be ready to sign your life away to about what you can and can't do at the resort. The only GOOD service was at the outside pool bar where the bartender was friendly, outgoing and very accomodating. The rooms were OK--nothing fancy or shiny and new. Oceanfront rooms are great for the view. Had maitenance issues with lights not working, and when I pulled the sliding glass door, the handle came off.

I have been planning this trip for quite awhile and kept coming back here to read all the new reviews that were posted to see what I could find out about the resort since I had not stayed there before. After reading the reviews, I was very concerned and thought I had made a HUGE mistake to plan a family vacation at a place I didn't know much about. We arrived at about noon and our room wasn't ready so we checked our luggage and went and did what we wanted and retrieved our luggage when we were able to check in (my parents also rented a condo and arrived at noon and their room was ready and they went right up, so yes they DO let you check in before 4:00pm if the room is ready). I was very nervous about the condo but there was no need to be. It was a VERY nice room. We rented a one bedroom condo and we were on the 15th floor. We ended up on the side of the building, overlooking the Ocean Walk shops and had a partial ocean view. It was perfectly fine with us. If you are not willing or able to pay the extra for the ocean front rooms then you need to be satisfied with the view you get and we were more than pleased with the room, ocean-front or not. Also, if you are on the street side of the hotel, you do have a water view of the Halifax River, which is very nice. Our condo was very nicely furnished with modern furniture and a nice booth-like eating area in the dining room. We had a large bathroom with a jacuzzi tub and a separate shower that was huge. The bedroom was really nice sized and had a king sized bed. We were very pleased with how clean and nicely furnished and painted it was. I don't know if some people don't understand that this is a condo, not a hotel but no....there is no maid service and it explains this in the directory if you take the time to read it. They are not going to come make your bed for you and give you clean towels. There is a washer/dryer in the unit and they give you two complimentary boxes or laundry detergent. It's a very small washer and we were able to do four loads of laundry with the two boxes of detergent we received, no problem. There was more than enough dishwasher detergent and liquid dish soap as well. I have no idea why anyone would need to go out and buy any themselves as I read in other reviews. I saw many people setting their trash out in the hallway for someone to take away and it sat there for a couple of days. I also read in the directory that you are to place it in the trash chute, which you walk right by to get to the elevators so we had no problem taking our trash and dropping it off and there were plenty of extra bags under the sink and also inside the bottom of the trash can. I had read about the issues with waiting in line for longer than an hour to check in but when we got there, I probably waited 1-2 minutes to both check in and check out. We had no problems with that. We also had no problems with the elevators. I never waited any longer than 1-2 minutes for an elevator at the VERY MOST. Generally it was there within seconds after hitting the button. Also, I never saw anyone placing towels on chairs at the pool and then leaving. We were down there several times and never had a problem finding a chair and never really noticed any chairs sitting with towels on them. There are PARTS of the pool area that are shaded after 1:00pm but certainly not the entire pool area. I was specifically curious after reading that so I made a point of checking on it and yes, there were certain areas that were shaded but definitely not the entire pool area. I could still find sunny parts up until about 3:00pm when we were there. We felt the pool area was more than accomodating for the number of people there but I imagine it might be different during Spring Break and I avoid travelling during that time due to the number of people you have to deal with. All in all, we had a wonderful time and would recommend this condo to anyone that asked. I thought the grounds were very nice, the staff was decent. Not OVERLY friendly but not rude either. There were several security guards around the building and in the pool area, which was nice to see.

We were just there for a week with our almost 2 year old. Nice family atmosphere, right on the beach, nice kiddie pool area, restaurants and water park next door. The pool area is large, but probably not quite big enough for the enormous resort. If half the people didn't go to beach there would be trouble. It was hard to get a chair if you didn't go out early. Of course we were out by 9:00am with our little guy. The pool is shaded by 1:00pm so it's best to do the pool in the morning and then move out to the beach in the afternoon. We used a week of my in-laws time share vacation for our stay so it only cost us $150 for the week. Of course we were pleased for that price - but if we had paid more I'm not so sure... We had an okay 1 bedroom with a great view of the ocean, which was a bonus surprise. The units without a view looked terrible. Windows facing into the hallway that were beat by the sun all afternoon. Probably very loud too. In room washer/ dryer was great - not sure if they all have that. Especially since you don't get any fresh towels for a week. I washed ours frequently at my own expense. We got two packets of laundry soap and when I called to get more I was told I had to go buy it. Also couldn't get anymore dishwasher soap, dish soap, paper towels, or garbage bags. I just took a trip to the dollar store down the road, but I was a little surprised by how rude housekeeping was when I called to ask. Check in time if 4:00pm and we weren't allowed in a minute before that. You can park early though and use the pool and beach if you arrive earlier in the day. That was okay, but I did have a problem with check out time. It's a ten in the morning. At 9:30 my husband started taking luggage out to the car - he was surprised to find housekeeping standing outside with their cart ready to come in. They stood there and watched him make 2 trips to the car, then started beating on the door at 9:45. I was so surprised I didn't say anything at the time, but.... We didn't have much contact with staff members other than the rude housekeeping department. There were several security gaurds stationed throughout the resort that were friendly and did seem to be doing a good job of checking for wrist bands or hotel keys.

We chose this resort for its location and amenties for children. I grew up in Daytona and am very familiar with the beachside, but this resort was built new after I moved away, so I was not familiar with it before we stayed there. Pros: Location is great, right on the beach. Attached to the boardwalk, which is undergoing renovations. Restaurants and a movier theater (and Starbucks) are right by the hotel. The hotel itself has indoor miniture golf, two indoor pools, a nice lobby, and a nice pool deck. The room was large and had a nice jacuzzi tub, the kitchen was well-stocked and the washer and dryer were very useful. Cons: The room we got was on the opposite side of the beach, so we had a view of the parking garage. The view was awful, we could smell car fumes when we had the sliding door open, and because the hotel is so tall, we could not even hear the beach or waves. The carpets were filthy, and my 1 year old was filthy from crawling on them. The service was ok, the staff responded to calls but were not always friendly. The bellman made it seem as if it was an imposition to help us with our luggage. Since we went in November, it was a little cool out, and the pool deck only had sunlight up till noon everyday since the very tall resort buildings blocked the sun after noon. So, we could only swim outside from about 9 till noon. The beach was covered in seaweed and there was only about 10 feet of beach between the seawall and the water. The seaweed is not clered off, so you really can't do anything on that stretch of beach. We drove to another beach to sit and play in the sand. Since this place is a timeshare place, we did do a presentation to get free Disney tickets. The presentation was nice and the salesman was pleasant. Be aware that Daytona Beach boardwalk area is still a little sketchy - not much has changed since I moved away. You will find homeless people hanging out on the boardwalk and asking you for money and cigarettes. Since I knew where I was I was not bothered by this, but if I had never been to Daytona, I would be unnerved by this.

Our family of 4 stayed in a one bedroom condo, which worked out great as there are 2 double beds in the bedroom, so we could put the kids to bed at night and still have some quiet time to ourselves to relax on the balcony or watch t.v. The unit was exactly like the photos on line. It was clean and had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. The resort itself had activities on every day for everyone in the family, so we could choose to participate or to just enjoy the pools and the beach. There was never any pressure to participate. (The \"dive-in-movie\" was a big hit with us all.) There are security people all over the place, so we felt somewhat safe there, but it didn't take long to notice that there are many ways into the resort without going through security, so it isn't quite as safe as it seems, but even so...some security is better than nothing, and more than you will find in most places. We never encountered any trouble there that's for sure. Beware of the \"short tours\" of the resort scam. Ocean Walk is a timeshare resort, and you will be approached many times (or called in your unit) to come for a \"short tour\" of the resort, usually for a prize of cash, free gas, etc. You don't have to go!!!

We were asked if we wanted to do the timeshare talk and we said no, and they promised us we would receive no phone calls about the timeshare. Well we received 4-5 calls per day starting around 7:30 in the morning (not when you want to be awoken on your vacation by annoying timeshare people) It wasn't even just the hotel people, they apperently \"sell\" the names and room numbers of their guests to a timeshare week place down the street, because they called us numerous times everyday, and they said they got our names and numbers from the hotel itself. We complained about this and the hotel stopped calling but the timeshare week people did not. Other than almost every game in the game room being broken (both air hockey tables) and the mini golf being very bad the hotel itself is very nice. Our room was clean, the only problem we had with the room, was in the extra bedroom and bath, there are a total of 4 doors. Only two locked. That was a problem as we had 3 children with us to tend to not knock on doors. The door to the hallway locked and the door to the bath and bedroom locked but the actual bedroom door and the door between the toilet and bath tub did not lock. We had a nice view of the ocean and pools. The elevators at this hotel were horrible to say the least. The only time we didn't wait at least five minutes for an elevator was very late at night, and the stairs weren't much of an option as we were on the 19 floor. There are only four elevators and over 20 floors of rooms. When you did get an elevator they sometimes were to full for you to even get on, and you would have to wait again for another. The pools were very crowded, and were full of sand, you must have a raft for the lazy river so you also usually must wait for those. The beach was nice at low tide, there was a sandbar the kids loved. I am not much on swimming in water where I can't see what is around me, so I didn't care for the beach much, but the guys loved body boarding and the kids liked it. Like I said this hotel is okay, and since we didn't pay for it I shouldn't complain, but I would never pay to stay here.", "Date": "July 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando,fl", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Ocean Walk in okay Daytona Beach\u201d", "Author": "kfamvacation", "ReviewID": "UR8213303", "Content": "Not a fan of Daytona Beach, but stayed just for Ocean Walk Resort.

The amenities were awesome, including lots of freebies like indoor mini golf, computer room, games you can check out, movie nights by the pool, lazy river between 2 outdoor pools.

Also 2 indoor pools. A great gym, adult game room seperate from kids game room (although pool table was broken in kids game room). There was also a spa, although I never made it there! We ate lunch and had drinks at the poolside bar one day and it was very reasonable for a resort. Some days there was a dj outside, and poolside games. Inside just off the lobby was an inside bar, and a restaurant serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. Ate the buffet breakfast one morning; average meal and price. Noticed dinner buffets also, but didn't eat there. Tip: if you walk into the restaurant there is an area to the right that sells food to take to your room (coffee, drinks, icecream, fruit , breakfast items, etc). Adjacent to the resort is a great area with shops, restaurants, movies...even a starbucks! The bandshell is also right there, they sometimes have free concerts. The Pier is within walkiing distance, and on Saturday night they gave us a great 15min. fireworks show from poolside! The Only complaints we had were that if you didn't get to the pool by 9:30-10:00am you didn't get a chair, and they could use more elevators-they were always busy-especially at ckin times or ckout mornings and if the beach and pools were suddenly closed for a storm.

However, we encountered none of the terrible concerns mentioned earlier. Concerning check-in, while it was 9 pm, it took about 5 minutes as there was no line. The desk staff was helpful and gave us good information. We had a 3 bedroom suite which has a balcony facing the beach. The unit had no major problems. Minor ones included no TV remote for the master bedroom, and the living room tv remote did not work well. Cooking supplies as in pans, etc., were quite slim, but we managed. Due to what we had to pay for the unit, we chose to eat as many of our meals in as possible. The refrigerator and ice maker was turned to the off position when we arrived, so it took a few minutes for the frig and freezer to get cold and the ice to produce. The unit was clean and well done. We only asked for additional wash clothes and all were delivered within 15 minutes. Then the desk called to make sure they were delivered. There are 4 elevators which serve each tower. There can be a wait during busy times of the day. We used those times to get a short workout and take the stairs to our 10th floor. Our 4 kids, ages 10-15, enjoyed the mini golf and game room. The pools were crowded on the weekend days but slowed down considerably on weekdays. On the weekend, the chairs were taken or marked with towels very early. Mgmt did issue notices to those who had not used their towels within 30 minutes by not being at the pool. It all seemed to work out. Parking can be tight in the parking structure. By late in the evening, spaces are hard to find. I was notified that a $12 a day charge would begin by 6/1. We did not eat at the resort except at the pool bar one day. Due to the crowd, it was extremely busy and very slow. The pools were great, the water warm, and the late night activities such as the \"dive in\" movie was great. This was a large, inflated movie screen by the pool. Access to the beach was very convenient through a gate at the back of the middle of the pool area. Vendors are immediately behind the gate with umbrellas, chairs, etc. for $25/day. It was convenient to have everything next door such as the movie theatre, Johnny Rockets, Starbucks, Baskins-Robbins across the street, IHOP down the street, etc. The beach was great, waves were good...we had no problems at all. We would seriously consider the resort again. We paid about $300/ night. This resort is next door to the Hilton Resort. I believe these two resorts are by far the nicest in this area of the beach.

I have read the recent reviews of this resort and was anxious to let people know how are stay went. We were very happy - we had 3 maintenance issues when we got to the room (screen door, light bulb, safe) and all were fixed within 30 minutes of reporting them. It took about 2 minutes to check-in (about 4:30 on a Saturday) and about the same to check-out(about 9:30am on a Saturday). The pools were warm, the grounds were beautiful. We had no complaints at all. There were some minor changes - there was definitely more security than in the past and you had to were your wristbands around the pools. I welcome this. They no longer do the cookouts, instead they serve food out of the tiki bar. We did not order any food. They no longer had the \"theme night\" as in the past, but this was no great loss to us either. You could not access the beach from the resort due to construction on a city park, so this was a minor inconvenience but not the resort's fault. We did talk to the guy who brought up our luggage about the recent bad reviews and he did say that since Wyndham took over the employees were not as happy as they were with Fairfield and that with major maintenance issues they were taking longer to resolve. As I mentioned above, we had no trouble with our maintenance issues. The room was very clean and well-stocked. I will attach some photos of the place. I still think this is the best place to stay in Daytona and I think Daytona in general is making improvements to clean up the city and make it more upscale.

Well, here I am feeling so strongly about the bad situation that I just experienced at the Ocean Walk Resort, that I feel it necessary to write a review. I will start with the short story: I checked in and then checked out within 2 hours of arriving. Here's the longer version: When I reserved the room which was for a business trip, I reserved an oceanfront room with a King size bed. I called the hotel about 3 days prior to arrival just to double-check on the reservation and was told that it was there, they had me in a room with a king bed, and the guy at the resort even told me that my room # had been assigned and gave me that information. I found that odd (since we were communicating over the phone, how could he be sure I was the actual guest who was going to be staying at the property?...that was a safety issue in my mind), but figured they do things a little differently here. After checking in I went up to the room and upon arriving at the door noticed that the white doors were very dirty. Not a good sign for someone who is very particular about cleanliness in a hotel. I went in and found that the bedroom was right at the front of the unit, with a window that opened to the hallway where people walk up and down to go to their rooms. Because of where my room was I literally had a view of the elevators. I didn't really like that set up, (would have preferred for the living room to be at the front and the bedroom at the back closer to the ocean), but figured I would just close the blinds and pull the curtains on the bedroom window so that people walking by couldn't see me and the light from the hallway would not bother me when I was sleeping. However, when I went to pull the curtains closed, they didn't move. They were \"fake\" curtains that were purely decorative and not functional, so I could close the blinds (which didn't close tightly and the light from the hallway still shone through), but I couldn't pull the drapes. I decided that I would go downstairs to see if there was another room that was set up differently. I noticed as I was leaving that the room didn't really have a \"clean\" feeling and the furniture looked tired. Also, the bedspreads on the 2 double beds didn't match. That looked really tacky. I went downstairs and asked the front desk worker (a different person from the lady who initially checked me in) if they had any rooms that didn't have windows that faced the hallway from the bedroom. He said that they do have rooms where the bedroom is at the back of the unit that would match what I was looking for. He said they were a slightly upgraded unit. I told him I was fine with that, I would pay the difference in price. He looked for a room, found one that was supposedly available, and gave me my 2nd get of keys. I went upstairs and thought to myself \"that wasn't bad...so glad I spoke up and asked about a different room\". I went in the room and as I headed to the bedroom, realized it was an un-cleaned room. The bedspread was on the floor, towels were on the floor in the bathroom, the kitchen had not been cleaned...it was a little disarming. So I called down to the front desk and told them that the room was not clean. I asked if someone from housekeeping could come up and clean it for me. (I really wanted to stay in the room because the layout was so much better than the last room. I was willing to wait an hour if that is what was needed to get the room in clean shape.) The lady who I spoke to said that she had taken note of the issue. She seemed like she was hanging up but I had no game plan yet, so I said to her \"do you want me to just stay up here and you will call me back to let me know what is going on?\". She said yes. I had to call back down since time had passed without hearing back from them. I asked for an update and was told that I was being moved to another room. She then said the bellman will come to bring my new key. I went to the new room (this is now room #3). I go in and turn to put on the security bar and realize there is none. There is the normal bolt that you can turn to lock the door in the hotel room, but the security chain or bar that is usually in a hotel room so that even housekeeping cannot come in if you are in there was not on the door. I felt very uncomfortable with that, especially since I was going to be the only one sleeping in the room. Also, I have never stayed in a hotel that did not have that security feature. So I went back downstairs and told them that my room did not have the security bar. The girl at the front desk looked alarmed at that but then said that she would see if engineering could go up and install one for me. She came back and said that they actually could not install one for me. She said they would just assign me another room. She assigned me another room and I asked her if she could tell by looking in her system if this new room had the security bar. She said no, the only way to find out is by actually going to the room. So I headed up to the room (room #4). Upon entering, I realize there was no security bar/latch...again. I call back downstairs because I refuse to stay in a hotel room that doesn't provide me with the adequate safety features. The front desk person then says that she has another comparable room in terms of layout, but that it is smoking, and apparently that is all she had to offer me. I told her that I don't smoke and I want a non-smoking room. She responded that many times even though it is a smoking room, it doesn't smell like smoke. I said fine. She told me to just stay up in the room and someone will bring me my key. About 3 minutes later, after more thought, I decided that I didn't want to compromise and go to a smoking room. I decided to go downstairs to the business center to use a computer to look for another hotel. I found my way to the business center (which is really a pool hall/lounge with a couple computers along the wall), and searched for a nearby hotel that had availability without success. I proceeded to the front desk to let them know that I am checking out because they were unable, after 5 tries, to find me a suitable room (all I wanted was a clean, non-smoking room that had the security bar/latch). The front desk lady (the 4th person I have now dealt with at the front desk) proceeds to do stuff in the computer. She kept doing things and doing things. After about 10 minutes I finally said to her \"I am just checking...I presume you are processing my refund back to my credit card?\". She looked at me and said \"no, we can't give you back your money\". I told her that I had not even stayed in a room yet...I had not even been in the hotel itself for more than 2 hours...and in no one room for more than 20 minutes. She went and got another lady who I am assuming is some sort of supervisor. This lady is one who had helped me locate a room with a security latch earlier, so she was clearly aware of all the issues I had been having. She asked me how she could assist me. I told her that I was checking out and that I didn't want to be charged for the stay. She said that they have a 72 hour cancellation policy and that they could not give me my money back. I asked her what the charge would be and she said the whole amount had been charged to my card for the 2 day stay and they couldn't refund any of it. I looked at her incredulously and explained that the only reason I was leaving was because they could not find a suitable room for me after 5 tries and I was really tired and didn't want to continue the saga. She refused to give me back my money. That was the final sign to me that this was not the place for me to stay. How a hotel can keep $400 + from someone who never stayed at their hotel is amazing to me. She just kept telling me I was choosing to leave even though they kept giving me different options. So did she expect I would just spend the whole night going from room to room, hoping we would find a clean, safe one?? At some point any reasonable person needs to put an end to the fiasco, and I ended it after 5 tries. I wasn't going to argue with her...figured I will just dispute with my credit card company. The customer service was horrible, the rooms were not clean and looked very run-down (the closet in one of the rooms was broken and kind of just leaning up in the track, and the carpet was pulled up, as if a dog had just clawed it for a long time), and they did not have the appropriate safety features that standard hotel room should have. I called my boss to tell her that I was leaving and told her my experience. She said she was going to add my experience to her list because she had had so many issues already herself (she also did not have a security latch on her door in her room, among other poor customer service issues). This was the shortest & worst hotel experience I have ever had. I do not recommend that hotel at all if you have any level of class or discernment. If you just want a place to lay your head between sitting at the beach, then maybe it is the place for you. But if you want safe, decently clean, and any level of customer service, please do not stay here.", "Date": "May 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas", "Title": "\u201cGood place\u201d", "Author": "LyndaKansas", "ReviewID": "UR7546151", "Content": "The Ocean Walk was an okay place to stay.

The timeshared part of the hotel (you can rent through vacationrentals.com, and I'm sure those poor timeshare suckers will be really thankful you did) is pretty nice. Suite-style rooms, with nice living room areas, TVs in all bedrooms, great master baths, washer and dryer, and a great kitchen. Not even a kitchenette - a full kitchen with oven and range. If you're coming to stay for a long time, you can definitely treat it as a home away from home. The rooms are clean, but you don't get replacement towels each day. The beach is actually quite nice and not horribly crowded. The pool's a little different story - fairly overrun, but not awful. It's a little dirty and rundown - everyone in our party cut their foot while in the pool. Some okay stuff for kids, including a nice (but small) lazy river to float in. We didn't eat in the hotel's restaraunt, so I can't comment there. The parking's okay, assuming you have one car.

I looked through a lot of reviews till my eyes went cross, and when I got in the car for the trip I have to admit was just a little bit worried. We got to the Resort at around 2, and since our friends were VIP we had early check in. Granted we waited for about 10 minutes while the people in front of us took forever, but as soon as it was our turn it took about 3 minutes to check in. We didn't have to wait till four like people had talked about on so many sites. The bell hop was right there ready to take our luggage upstairs. The eleveators were quick (in fact the only time we had a really long wait was the day we left). After we got back from the grocery store we realized that our fridge did not work, they came up in about 10 minutes to fix it. they advised us that if it still didn't work they would come back. at about 10:30 at night we called them because it still wasn't working. They came up and replaced the fridge that late at night. That was the only problem that we had. The rooms were nice, nothing was broken or stained. The pools were the right tempature. Later in the afternoons the teenagers got a little out of control, but the security (yes they are every where around this place) quickly put stops to it. I have nothing bad to say about this place. It was the best place i have stayed in, and I have stayed at some really nice places. the staff is perfect and always willing to help (if the bartender is Nathan ask for his special drink). And I am not sure if the problem was fixed or never exsisted, but we never had to wait for a pool chair. There were always more then enough, and they do take your towl and stuff to the sun center if you do leave your chair for more then a hour. Also if you are looking for gifts a local gift shop across the street from the resort on the corner is the best out there. nothing is overly priced and has a lot of stuff. Too many people are picky about this place. They need to understand that this is a time share type enviroment. you are not going to get new towls everyday and you beds are not going to be made (although half way through our trip they came in and gave us new towls and made the beds).

We rented directly from the owner, not the hotel. Check-in was a breeze, room ready on time, and the room was clean! (and I'm very picky). We bought all our own food, and even extra TP just in case, washed our own towels, which by the way, we had plenty for 7 people. You do have to wash your own towels and take out your own trash, but they have trash chutes on all floors. We felt very safe, always security walking around, checking wrist bands to see if you were a guest around the pool area. Always found a parking place, but we were never out super late maybe 9pm at the latest, with 4 small children. The only down side was that the elevators were slow at times, like check out times or \"time to go to the beach and pool\" times. But overall not too bad. Never waited for one longer than 5 minutes. You have to expect crowds if you go during spring break, and maybe even a little partying, but there was never anything that was too annoying, couldn't hear much thru the walls, and we had some parties going on above us a few nights. The pool does get crowded early, and you can't go down just to put your stuff on a chair, b/c if hotel staff walks around and sees no one in the chairs, they put a notice on them, and if no one has returned in 30 minutes, they remove your things and take them to the towel stand to be retrieved. I suggest renting 2 beach chairs, little table, and umbrella for $25/day, plus you can add extra chairs for $8 a piece. Pool does calm down later in the day, so go then. Whatever you do--don't order delivery from a restaurant called \"Pizza, Subs and More\". There was an advertisement in our room for it, so one night we called and it was the worst food ever! Not just a few of the things, but everything we ordered! We just laughed about it b/c it was so bad.

Got kicked out of line twice stating that we were not allowed to pre register. Room was not ready by 4pm. When we finally got into our room, we were given a 1 bedroom instead of two. When I called down to the desk they told me I had to get back in line to get the room fixed. When I finally got the right room, we all decided to take showers, but no hot water. The whole tower had no hot water and this had been a problem for 2 days now, and they checked me in anyways. I went down to complain and there were 30 some people down in the hotel lobby complaining about the hot water. I finally got my room changed about 10pm at night. What a vacation. Then when we got to our new room, there were no towels and it was smaller than the original room. When I went to the desk, I was told that the laundry is sent to Orlando and the truck hasn't come in yet. I was able to get a few towels, but no washcloths for 3 days! The next day I called to see when my room would be cleaned, since when I booked it a year ago, I was told it would have housekeeping included. The woman laughed and said \"honey you must clean your own room, wash your own towels, and take out your trash!!!\" So I paid over $300.00 a night for nothing. The next morning I again went to the front desk and was given free dinner tickets for all my problems. So my family went to dinner the next evening. We ordered chicken, and actually got 4 plates of completely raw chicken. We returned it to the kitchen and they were very apologetic, but my kids got up walked out and went to Burger King. They did make sure they took pictures of their raw chicken!!The next day we went to Disney and came back at midnight to no parking spots. One day we lost power in our room. You definitely don't get what you pay for here at this hotel. The staff got to know me because of my frequent complaints, and they stated since they changed hands from Fairfield to Wyndham, the hotel has gone downhill. They fired most of their housekeeping staff. The staff hates it. They laugh about the inservice they must attend where they learn about MAGIC-making a good impression on the customer. This hotel makes an impression on the customer, but not a good one. You must go down to the desk for toilet paper or anything else you might run out of. Its a joke of a vacation staying here. I saved up all year to take my kids on this trip with their friends, and I was thoroughly disgusted. I have stayed at alot of hotels before, but this is definitley the worst. There were parties down the hall with kids getting arrested. It was very loud. There were missing pictures on the wall, just nails in the wall, the sliding glass door to the balcony didn't shut properly, so we were left with sand flies all over our room every morning. And you would think when a different company takes over, customers would be notified since it doesn't include the same things as when the room was booked. If it had housekeeping when it was booked, it should have it when I stay there or my price should be reduced. The owners of shops in Ocean Walk also laugh about the hotel. They say when they have friends and family come down, they won't let them stay at Ocean Walk because its so bad, they stay at the Hilton. The security is a joke. I also picked this hotel because it was supposedly safe and you needed your key to get into the hotel, parking garage and into the pool area. There was never a security guard at the pool gates. The gates were always open There were always kids walking around from different hotels. The elevator waits were sometimes 10 minutes long.

Check in for us was to be 2:00 pm since we are owners with Fairfield/Wyndham and have vip status.. Well, we got behind about 6 other families and waited while 1 girl worked to get everyone squared away with their reservations, meanwhile, the non vip line had 4 people working and they were getting people through very quickly. When we got our turn, we were told that there was a \"issue\" with the room we were supposed to be in on the 13th floor, so they were going to have to put us in a room on the 9th floor (#928 North Tower) but the room wasn't ready yet, so we would need to wait and were told we could walk around and get familiar with the resort. We did and came back about 40 minutes later and still the room was not ready. I asked for the keys anyway and said that we at least wanted to get our stuff out of the car andneeded the key to get into the garage. The only way to get a luggage cart was to pay a bellhop to do it for you, they guard those things with their life. Our room was large and overall very clean and well kept, with the exception of the cracked toilet seat in the master bath OUCH! and the broken handle on the microwave and the screen door on the balcony that was unable to open and close. The jacuzzi drained while you were in it, so you had to keep adding water to it. I think the thing that upset me the most was the totally disassembled smoke detector in the master bedroom. i mean, someone had pulled wires and all. This bothered me immediately and was never fixed even after reporting it. Ironically, on Tuesday morning at 6:00 a.,m. the alert speaker that is also in the room, went off and we all quickly got shoes on and gathered at the door and went downstairs with many of the other guests from the resort, seems there was a small fire in the trash chute of the south tower! On the flip side, I have to say that the resort is very nice. The pool did get crowded early and this time of year it was with all the spring breakers that were hung over from the all night partying they did the night before, but the pools are nice, the beach area is great and the indoor pools are also nice. The folks at the bars are really nice and were really sweet with my young girls who were ordering Virgin Pina Colads all week.

Please note, some rooms, I believe they contain a B in the room number, do not have a balcony or window to the outside. They face the interior hallway.

In addition to the 2 bedroom deluxe, which faced north (beach view if we look to the right) we spent our last couple nights in a 1 bedroom deluxe which faced south, actually we had a view of the other tower and the lobby area. We didn't mind at all. I do not have photos of the one bedroom deluxe unit but it was also very clean, well appointed and everything was in good working order. Both rooms had a jacuzzi tub. Things to consider - I am not sure if this is true for all staying at this resort but we stayed as part of our timeshare/points system. There is no daily maid service. If you want a touch up, they will come and do that for a fee. Your bed will not be made unless you do it. You will not get fresh towels everyday. For touch up cleaning you are provided with a washer and dryer in your room, a vaccum cleaner, a dishwasher, a broom and a mop. They give you enough laundry soap for two loads and an adequate amount of paper towels, dish soap and dishwasher detergent. If you expect someone to come and bring you fresh towels and make your bed it is not going to happen (unless it is different for some folks renting rooms not as timeshares). If you are not sure if this applies to you, ask before you book your trip. If this (not happening) will ruin your trip you might want to stay somewhere else.

We had read some complaints that the property was dirty. We did not find this to be so. The view, design of the rooms and location were fantastic. Yu are near the pier,arcades, shops and movies. Starbucks is a half a block away. We are from Portland,Oregon so we really enjoyed our morning latte. Some thoughts on the resort:: The design and architectural style of the resort is first class but it is not kept up as well as it should be and the staff although friendly aren't very attention oriented. They seemed lazy and not interested in resolving problems. I booked my stay for a week but later called to extend my stay by one night. They told me they would have to cancel my reservation and start again. If they did this there was a chance I would lose the whole reservation and no t be able to have the upper floor, ocean front unit I wanted. Since we booked six months ahead and I didn't want to lose my reservation, I didn't want to do this. At check-in I again asked to extend the stay. They said I could but would have to come down early on the check-out day to do this. I wanted to avoid getting up early and avoid the check-out lines so I tried to do it the night before. The desk-clertk said it was a done deal but the next day they called me twice, saying why haven't I checked out. My key also didn't work, after keying it twice. The maid also knocked on the door at 10:00 to make sure we were leaving,,when we weren't. It just seemed a little tacky and rude. Customers didn't come first. We had a very pretty two bedroom condo. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were very quiet with good black-out curtains. Although very well designed to look top quality, it had a broken armoir, a kitchen faucet that sprayed the counter, leaky tub and a dryer that you had to slam multiple times to close. At check-out I gave the repairs list to the front staff and they didn't seem to care or say they would get on it. The lazy river wasn't heated ( and it was thanksgiving vacation) and since it was cold out, the lifequard wasn't at the slide most of the day. It seems like they were trying to save money by hiring an unpolised front desk staff and defering maintence. Since many rooms are on a timeshare program, they seemed more interested in getting the money than keeping it or providing a quality vacation. Many of the hotels in Daytona are upgrading and refurbishing themselves, soon competetion will be tough.On a positive note, many child activities, arts and crafts were offered. The game room was fun. They had a large TV with Gamecube and Nintendo. There was free mini-golf and if you have teens, its near the movies and shops so you wouldn't need to drvie. Good restaurants are within walking distance. I recomment seeing the manatees at Blue Springs State Park, the Space Center and a trip to St. Augustines.

As always had a great time. We tend to set up shop down on the beach, so I don't know about the problems reserving poolside lounges. Beach was great; there is now an ice cream wagon parked on the beach most of the day right in front of the hotel, which is convenient. We bought the lunch by the pool every day; it's really convenient. The steak sandwich is a steak, not sliced steak, a small individual steak on a bun. At $6, it's a steal! They will cook the steaks rare and they were delicious. There were fireworks at about 9:30 on Saturday night, which we watched from our balcony. Very impressive; it lasted about 20 - 30 minutes and had some cool effects. The kids all loved it. The arts and crafts were fun; our whole family made stained glass, which are now proudly displayed on our kitchen window... I highly recommend this hotel. My sister and her husband also loved it and are considering buying with Fairfield Resorts, which owns the hotel. I have noticed the many negative comments recently posted and I was a bit nervous, but we had no major problems. Our room was clean and tidy.

Every bad review is right on!! Now I am going to add mine. My husband, myself and my twin 6 year old daughters were so excited to come here as our last vacation of the summer before the girls started school. What a mistake coming here. From the minute we arrived it was a disaster!! We arrived around 4:30 pm. Check in was chaotic. The bellman brought our bags to our room......he was coming down the hallway leaving our room and my husband asked him if we were \"all set\"?? He replied, \"well, almost, your room was never cleaned\". He said that, and just kept right on walking. He never offered to call someone for us, or try to help us out in anyway. When we walked into our room, I honestly thought I went into a state of shock. We travel quite a bit, and I am not exxagerating when I say that this room was disgusting!!! The room had a bad odor, the carpeting was filthy with crumbs, etc. None of the beds were made up and all of the bedding was in piles all over the floor. The bathtub was filled with dirty towels. The kitchen was full of garbage and dirty dishes. As we were walking throughout the room, my daughter found a spider on the rug, my husband found a dirty shoe (yes, I said SHOE) in the room safe!!! I feel like I could go on and on about the condition of this room and how bad it was. When they finally sent someone up to clean it, they told us it would take about 40 minutes to clean, which I thought they would have had to have been miracle workers. We didn't get into our room until 7:30 pm. The supervisor at the front desk acted like this whole thing was \"no big deal\". She then offered me a gift certificate at the restaurant in the hotel for breakfast. No thanks....the food was cafeteria food at best. We went for breakfast the following morning to the Hilton....just down the street. Wish we would have stayed there. The pools were dirty looking/stained as was the pool deck. Everything just looked run down. I would never, ever stay here again even if they offered me to stay for a week free!!!! People.....don't believe what you see and read on Ocean Walk Resort web page.......they make everything look really nice and clean, etc. and it is the complete opposite.

A list of what was missing and approximate value: -Bebe Jeans ($125) -American Eagle belt ($39) -Pink Coach wristlet ($68) -Bebe black rhinestone bathing suit ($85) -Polo Ralph Lauren black bathing suit ($95) -Hollister rhinestone jean skirt ($48) It is unfortunate these items are not covered under insurance as the resort suggested... it just saddens me because I bought these items with my own money, most of them for my exciting Spring Break adventure at the OceanWalk Resort, and I ended up losing items (approx.$460 worth) totaling more than my 5 night stay at the resort ($236). When we arrived early and couldn't check-in, I didn't even give a second thought to not trust the resort to hold my luggage. But the fact that the items missing were the easiest to access because of their location in my suitcase leads me to conclude they were taken during the time they were under the supervision of the resort. *** Also, when we handed our luggage over to the bellman, we were told they would be brought up to our rooms upon check-in. I had to call down to the front desk to inquire about my luggage, and with no results, then go down and ask about my luggage because it still hadn't arrived in our room an hour or more after our party checked-in at approximately 5:00---and we were getting worried! ***** After 4 months now of communicating (phone calls, emails and paperwork) with the resort staff and management and doing everything they suggested (filing a police report with the Daytona Beach Police; filing a claim with their insurance company) it seems Ocean Walk Resort Management has elected to ignore my communications and thus take no responsibility for my loss while my valuables were in their possession.", "Date": "July 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis", "Title": "\u201cOkay, but be ready for a sales pitch...\u201d", "Author": "jenkaa", "ReviewID": "UR5514503", "Content": "We had never been to Daytona and were finishing a vacation that started at Walt Disney World, so we were looking for calm and quiet. We checked in on Wednesday and checked out on Sunday. Check in was okay. We stayed in the condo tower. Our main complaint was that we kept getting pushed to go to a sales meeting on Saturday to encourage us to buy a unit (which we had no plans to do). As mentioned by others, chairs at the pool are all but impossible to obtain unless you go down at 8am to \"reserve\" a chair by placing a towel on it. After doing this one day, we decided the beach was much preferable (cooler, less crowded, and less obnoxious). We didn't use the \"lazy river\" but it was not supervised by hotel staff in any way, that we could see. We saw no rules being enforced. The beach is lovely with a sandbar just off shore which made the ocean less anxiety-ridden for those with little ocean experience. It was expensive to rent umbrellas and chairs (two chairs and an umbrella for $25) but we did this one day and were glad to have spent the money. Weekends are a MADHOUSE! Friday evening, the hotel started to fill up. Obnoxious kids were running the hallways until about 11pm, hitting windows (which open onto the hallway from the bedrooms), and making lots of noise. Elevators were almost impossible. My husband lost his driver's license while there and needed a police report for our return flight home. The hotel security staff was hard to get hold of. He waited in the lobby for a long time before anyone came to assist him. When they DID come, they claimed to call the local police, who were supposed to come to the hotel to make a report. No one ever came, even after prompting several times to the hotel staff, and finally we were encouraged to go to the police station in town. When we went there, we were informed that the Beach Patrol takes care of such problems and they are available ON THE BEACH, JUST OUTSIDE THE HOTEL! My husband and I wasted about 2-3 hours just trying to get this taken care of. We couldn't believe that the hotel staff would not know to direct us to the (very accessible) Beach Patrol. We enjoyed the beach, the hotel was okay, you had to figure out how to get towels (on the bottom floor by the indoor pool) and then wash and dry them yourself so that you would have them for the week. We LOVED having a washer/dryer in the room. We went home with mostly clean clothes! The little \"mall\" just south of the hotel was good for eating (Bubba Gump's and Adobe Gila's were our favorites).

But I felt the \"lazy river\" became a loud, crazy zone of wild, unruly children pushing and shoving and turning it into bumper cars, with many \"tube-jackings\" (kids stealing inner tubes). Fortunately my usually quiet children stuck up for themselves and managed to maintain inner tubes long enough to enjoy themselves. The sign stated \"children under 12 must be supervised\" so I went in the River with them the first few times, but when I realized I was the ONLY adult in there being shoved & splashed, I quickly learned that the rule was not enforced.

The beach chairs and umbrellas are not a part of the hotel and you must pay extra to rent them. We chose not to and just played in the ocean. On Sunday, things settled down a bit. We were actually able to get an elevator with only a 5 minute wait (15 minute waits were the norm on Saturday). We don't mind walking but they put us on the 17th floor). The lazy river was almost lazy instead of crazy on Sunday and Monday. The biggest problem that I did not plan for was the lack of POOL TOWELS! BRING YOUR OWN!

The views were to die for, we were on the 17th floor which i was a little concerned about with having a very active 3 year old, as the balcony wall and rails were quite low, but our patio doors were quite difficult to open for myself, and my husband as the runners were slightly faulty, due to the salt air.......the beds were very comfortable, and good quality bedding.....A beautiful bathroom with plently of towels, the only bad thing about the bathroom was the cheap shower curtain rail, which with the slightess touch would fall from the walls.......but luckily my husband tightened it, so it was fine from there on........ ...The hotel itself is beautiful with 2 indoor pools which were beautiful and 3 outdoor pools which included a childrens pool and a lazy river..... i had a few bad points about the pool area though as there were very few chairs around the childrens pool, due to the fact that people without children would seat themsleves there..which really annoyed me as there were plently of seats around the main pools...this meant that families were forced to stand or sit on walls to watch thier children play in the pool.....Another thing which was really annoying about the pool area was the rush for seating in the mornings...people would queue before 7.30- 7.45 to get a seat, even though you were not allowed into the pool area before 8.00, after 8.00am it was manic, 100+ people running to get their spot.......by putting a towel or bag on the lounger, once they had done this they would then go, and sometimes not come back for hours, so when you came to the pool, the seats were empty, but we could not use them..! The hotel was very busy, but the staff i found were very helpful, in all areas. Great location across from Ocean Village shopes, and Daytona Water park. We would definately go back, but probably earlier in the year and would book the 2 bedroom oceanview unit.

Ocean Walk is probably one of the best resorts in Daytona Beach, and with certain\u2026..\u201dcorrections\u201d\u2026. it could be one of the nicer resorts in the state. BUT\u2026 there are certain things that keep it from being the premier resort that I expected and like I have enjoyed elsewhere, and I am not sure that those \u201ccorrections\u201d can be effected. But let\u2019s start with the PROS ------- POOLS \u2013 Two outdoor, two indoor, one Lazy River (the four pools are a good size, Lazy River not such a good size) Water slide on one end of the pool area, kiddy play area (small slide, lots of sprinklers) on the other. BEACH\u2013 There is very little beach in Daytona that cars are NOT allowed to be on (Why anyone would want to sit next to their car while on a beach is beyond me, why anyone would want to sit by someone ELSE\u2019s car on a beach is beyond sanity) Fortunately, no cars allowed on this section of beach) ROOMS/SUITES \u2013 Spacious, nicely decorated, and well appointed (with the exception of surprisingly small TV\u2019s, in comparison with everything else \u2013 but we weren\u2019t there for the TV anyway) STAFF\u2013 Everyone we had dealings with was courteous and professional, though unlike other resorts we have stayed at, never felt anyone was \u201cpersonally interested\u201d in the guests OTHER leisure facilities \u2013 Well appointed exercise room, game room, pool table, computers, spa all on premises CONS ------- HOUSEKEEPING \u2013 non-existent during my stay. Over 50,000 Fairshare points to stay here, and didn\u2019t even get a \u201ctrash and tidy\u201d ONCE. FOOD \u2013 There is a coffee shop here; it is not table service, and quality is barely a cut above fast-food. One would think that a 4-star resort would have at least a 3-star restaurant. And the prices are ridiculous, for the quality. Four bucks for a hot dog with nothing (no fries, no kraut, no nothin\u2019) at the poolside grill, and it\u2019s bland as all get out. First high-end, \u201cfull service\u201d resort I have been to without a full serve restaurant. BEACH \u2013 Early every morning, a chair-and-umbrella rental place sets out their furniture across the entire width of the hotels beachfront, about 2 feet between set-ups, taking up the entire \u201cfront row\u201d of the beach (you know, the high tide line, the closest bit of soft sand to the water). They then wait to rent the set-ups to people throughout the day. If you are unable or unwilling to drop $25 for the day, or if you just prefer a sheet on the sand to a lounge and umbrella, you have to either go past the hotels boundaries, or sit behind the huge furniture, having it block your view of the water. Or sit in the wet sand in front of the furniture - not too comfy LIFEGUARDS \u2013 saw the highchairs, but never saw a guard on them during our entire stay. Not comforting with small kids, considering the strength of Daytona Beach currents. NOISE \u2013 EVERY day, for four hours in the middle of the afternoon (about 11 to 3) DJ\u2019s set up speakers about half the size of a Volkswagen, on a balcony in the center of the pool area. They play music, one of them sings to his own electric piano accompaniment (I would tell him \u201cnot to give up his day job\u201d, but it IS his day job ! ) and they blast the volume so loud that we could hear it way down on the beach, one hotel away. Poolside, you have to shout to have a conversation, except at the very far ends of the pool. I am not a loud music hater by any means, but these guys NEVER TAKE A BREAK. Those of us who like to be able to converse a bit don\u2019t get anytime at all during those 4 hours, which I think is grossly unfair. If one wants to hear music non-stop, and there is no DJ playing, one can always use an iPod, or walkman. If one wants to hear only the ocean, or your own conversation (or your kids calling for you from the pool?) there is no \u201ciPod for silence\u201d. All management would have to do to be fair to all is let the DJ take a break for 15 minutes an hour. (I talked to the DJ \u2013 management insists on non-stop music) ELEVATORS \u2013 Two towers. Approximately 300 rooms per tower. Only four elevators per tower. Do the math. (You\u2019ll have plenty of time while you\u2019re waiting for an elevator to arrive, or while riding up or down from a high floor.) CHECK IN. \u2013 Even if your room is ready, you will NOT be allowed to check in to your room before 4 pm. You can check in to the hotel earlier, and get your wristband to use the facilities, but you still have to go back to the desk at 4 pm to get your room card. The day we checked in, so did 238 other rooms. You can guess what the line was like. Makes no sense at all not to let people have their room early if it is ready when they arrive. CHAIR CONTEST \u2013 The pool deck closes for cleaning between 6 am and 8:15 every morning. At about 7:45, people start milling about (not lining up \u2013 MILLING \u2013 there\u2019s a difference \u2013 lining up implies order, courtesy, respect for first come first serve) the entrances to the pool area. At 8:15, the security guards \u2013 yes, SECURITY GUARDS \u2013 who have been keeping people off the deck step back, and the race for a chair is on. Within 3 minutes, all lounges and tables are saved. You wont be able to get one until late morning or early afternoon if you aren\u2019t there by \u201copening bell\u201d CROWDS \u2013 Despite all these great facilities, they DO NOT SUPPORT THE POPULATION. And this is not something that should be excused just because it was peak time; we ALWAYS travel at peak times (I work for the schools, and have two kids in elementary school \u2013 only take vacations at peak times \u2013 Spring Break, President\u2019s Week, etc) and this is the worst overcrowding I have seen anywhere, except possibly the Jersey Shore on 4th of July weekend. This place has been OVERBUILT. Too many rooms, the towers are too high (they also put the pool in shade by 1 pm, and the BEACH in shade by about 3:30 pm), and there is no feeling of spaciousness or leisure to the place; rather, it is more FRENETIC than relaxing. I guess that last bit is a Con more from Personal Preference \u2013 not everyone wants relaxation at a high-end resort, and The Crowd here certainly seemed to like the frantic pace. The general population here seemed not so much a Young Spring Breaker crowd - more like a Carnival crowd. Not seedy, but certainly more tacky than we are used to in a high-end resort.But I guess htis is not as high-end as I first believed.", "Date": "April 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "north carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat place\u201d", "Author": "lovingcarolina", "ReviewID": "UR4966730", "Content": "1 bedroom unit was great.

That't it! Over a week ago I stayed at this hotel for five days 3.26.-3.31. After we checked in we noticed that the room was not properly inspected. First of all the one of the cabinet in the bathroom was missing, the roller blind (curtain) that was covering the washer and dryer were broken, the disposal waste in the kitchen was not working, since it was full of silverware and thrash. In addition the nightstand in the living room was missing a leg. Two hours after we checked in we called the front desk and put in a claim for replacing the little table in the living room. Unfortunately, it took over 3 hours and nobody showed up. Therefore we called again and they told us that next day someone form maintenance will come and replace it. On Monday morning someone from maintenance showed up, took the table, told us that we will get another one soon, but it never happened... On Friday after a very nice stay at the resort, and very wonderful vacation, we were sure that we would come back again. However, on the 4th of April my credit card was charged 430 dollars, and I really thought that was a huge misunderstanding! I called the hotel and talked to the clerk from accounting, they said that the charge was because of damage to the the room and they listed 4 things that were missing or broken, the missing cabinet in the restroom, broken stereo (that we never had in our room), broken curtain. I was told that I would be transferred to the manager but I was not. They said that the manager is busy, and can call me back, but it never happened. In addition, I requested the full list of the things that I was charged, but they refused. I also asked to send the list of the broken things to my email, but it never happened. Yesterday I claimed the dispute at the Bank for an unauthorized charge on my account. EVERYBODY!! Be careful, and after checking in properly inspect your room and call the front desk!

I don't think any of them are as \"happening\" as this hotel is though. If you are looking for a little more seclusion, you might check out the Shores. If you want to be where the action is, this is the place! I purchased my rental directly from a condo owner on E-Bay. You can get much better rates than booking online. The room we had was outstanding! It was a street view but it was up high enough to see the ocean as well. The view of the city was outstanding at night. The room was ultra clean. I've read other people complaining about the cleanliness, but we had no problems. As a matter of fact, we noticed staff cleaning all over the resort constantly - railings, windows, etc. The same people clean this room as clean the time share units. It was also huge! Two bedrooms, full kitchen, two bathrooms (one with a huge Jacuzzi), dining room and a wrap around balcony! Why stay in a hotel room? My only complaint is the crowdedness at the pool. There really isn't enough room for the number of people in the hotel to all be at the pool. This is pretty typical for a huge resort, but I still don't like it. What I did like was that the guards were going around and removing towels from chairs that hadn't been occupied for sometime. My wife and I took a spot that we were suprised to find. Later the original \"owner\" showed up and gave us an earful. We told her that we didn't move her stuff, but she didn't care. I think the hotel should let people know up front they are going to police the pool chairs. I agree that they should, but it puts folks like us in a bad situation. The funny part was here stuff was on two chairs right in front of the \"No reserving pool furniture\" sign. Here's a tip: Can't find a place to sit? Follow a couple of the guards around. Eventually they'll move someone's stuff and you can get that spot. Be prepared to hear about it though! Check-in was a nightmare, but many people that had stayed there before said this wasn't typical. They were having computer problems. The next day didn't look even half as bad, so it probably was some sort of glitch. While we were there, everyone was nice. We didn't really take advantage of services other than the pool bar. They were very friendly there as you might imagine. The activities center and staff are outstanding. There is always activities going on either for kids, families or adults. Every day they have a DJ at the pool; crafts, games or activities in the Activities center; and lots of exercise class options. Each afternoon there is a Ice Cream party - great for kids of all ages. There were several things for adults in the evening like dance lessons and a billiards tournament. The schedule of events rivals that of cruise ships we have been on. They really have a first class outfit! All in all it was an outstanding trip!

In general we had a good time. The kids had a blast! There were tons of other teens (espcially girls!) at the pool and on the beach, so our boys were not bored for a single second. The pool deck is open 22 hours (closes from 6 - 8 a.m. for cleaning) and has 24 hour security, so we let the kids stay out \"late\" with no worries. The OceanWalk Village area was \"crawling\" with Security guards and police, so we felt very safe. I guess there was more security than normal because of BCR weekend. We checked in on Wednesday, we were first in line and it still took 25 minutes to get checked in by a very flustered new employee. On Sunday the check in line stretched all the way from the lobby into the bar and it was taking some very upset people over 2 hours to check in! Apparently the resort had trouble getting the BCR revelers out of bed to check out - thus the delay in cleaning rooms and checking in new arrivals. We rented a lovely 2 bedroom oceanfront unit from the resort. We loved the floorplan - we had 2 of everying! 2 bedrooms, living rooms, kitchens, bathrooms and even 2 sets of washers and dryers. The kids really enjoyed having their own \"place\"! The unit was very clean, the furnishings were nice (except one sleeper sofa had seen better days)and the carpet was ripping out where it met the tile. The jacuzzi tub in the master bath was awesome and the jets weren't too loud. The oceanfront balcony was spacious and our unit was supplied with 10! plastic deck chairs. We did not have maid service during our 5 day stay - but we didn't really need it and didn't ask for it. I just assumed being we rented from the resort, we would automatically have maid service. However, we were supplied with a generous allotment of towels everyday, including extra large fluffy blue and white striped beach towels. When we made our reservation in December, we requested an upper floor unit. We were put in a unit on the 4th floor (which is the lowest!). Turns out we liked being on the 4th floor. Easy stair access to the pool and lobby and we had a great view of pool deck and beach so we could easily see what the kids were doing. My husband (who is recovering from 8 months of chemo) could sit on the balcony and enjoy the pool atmosphere without leaving the room. The only drawback was the noise at 7:00a.m. from the power sprayer used to clean the pool deck. The resort was booked full during our stay, but it never seemed too crowded. At 9:30 a.m. there was still a good selection of chairs by the pool - by 10:30 they were all taken. I didn't really observe a lot of \"reserving\" chairs that is mentioned in other reviews. The pools are beautiful, but we were grossed out by the huge(3 INCHES LONG!)bugs swimming in the pool. Someone said they were palmetto bugs. COCKROACHES that can swim and fly! Yuck! They were only in the South Tower pool with the slide. The North tower pool was bug free. We really enjoyed the Pool Bar and the cheeseburgers from the grill! On Thursday, we rented chairs and an umbrella ($25) on the beach. On Friday, Saturday & Sunday the vendor was not there, maybe because of BCR? See the concierge for restaurant resevations and lining up acitivities. She was extremely helpful! She lined up jet skis and street legal scooters for the kids from a great place on Ponce Inlet that has all new equipment! (Scooters were delivered to the resort. Kids skiied at Ponce Inlet and on the ocean - best ever!) A few notes of caution: 1.) Parents - watch your little ones! A 3 yr. old boy left his parents condo on his own! His parents were frantically trying to find him and after an hour of hell, security did locate him. This could have been tragic! 2.) Another little boy got his arm stuck in the elevator. It took several strong adults to pry the elevator doors open to free his arm. (It was badly bruised)Be aware - elevators can malfunction and can be dangerous! 3.) DANGER!!! WATCH FOR CARS!!! DRIVE SLOWLY in the parking ramp. On Monday, an elderly woman was hit by a car in the parking ramp. What a way to ruin your vacation! People drive way to fast and walkers need to stay out of the driving lanes. I can't emphasize this enough! Overall we had a great time at this resort and would definitely go again.

Clean Rooms. 1 BR Unit was well spacious and comfortable for a family with 2 small children. Laundry in room was great. Entertainment by the pool everyday...music & contests. Kid's pool was great for small children - especially toddlers (mine were 5 & 7 and had fun in it). Consierge very helpful and made reservations for us quickly and got us a good table. CONS - Now let me say - don't let this list overwhelm you...all in all our stay was very good. This is only to educate you ahead of time. During the entire week housekeeping never came once - I washed all the towels myself. They try to tell you the striped beach towels are \"for the week\"...no thanks ...I'm NOT going to take my sandy wet towel out in the morning and NO I'm not going to wash those too! Hospitality of staff was very inconsistent - some were VERY nice and some really didn't have a clue what was going on OR didn't really want to help. Pool with the waterslide was not heated and even in high 80 degree weather - you didn't find me in there...even my kids wouldn't go in! Lazy River was not heated and freezing too. By around early afternoon at least half of the pool area is shaded (including the kid's pool) so it is imperative that if you want a good sunny chair all day...get out of bed and get down there right when the pool opens at 8:15 ...no joke...people are lined up waiting. Get as close to the fence by the beach as possible for the longest sun. Tips - When parking in the garage go DOWN instead of up - there are always spots on the lower level and you can go right in the LL door and up the elevator. If you go during spring break (or during any major convention ie. Car Stereo Convention) just know that it's a bit crazy. Maui Nix Surf Shop was great (the big one down the street) a lot of great stuff and my husband rented a surf board for a few days from them. Beach - Chairs are not provided by the resort and are generally available by a vendor for $8/day (x 2 x5 to 7 days...lot of money when you are only spending maybe the afternoon on the beach because the pool is now shady). We bought cheap chairs and some sand toys. On the way out I asked people in line if they had children and passed down the sand toys to be enjoyed by other children. Restaurants - Highly recommend The Chart House...then Stonewood Grill and Inlet Harbor was fun (kid's had a blast in wooden ship they have to play in). Hope you find this helpful.

A good time to go as the high season crowd seem to have eased off. The Fairfield resort was more than we expected from some of the previous reviews we had read. We swapped our points to Ocean Walk to be close to the beach and have a quality experience. We had never been to Florida before so was somewhat nervous not knowing what to expect. The Fairfield staff from the front desk to check out were outstanding and helpful in every way. We had a wonderful unit facing onto the beach and pool area. We were on the 17th floor which gave us a fantastic view of the ocean and sea front, as well as away from any noise. We observed that the units on the reverse side of the facility had a nice view of the inland waterway and city, but you get what you pay for. This resort has most everything that an individual or family would want. You can have individual privacy on the beach or family fun with all of the in-house or local area activities. Attached directly to the resort is Ocean Walk which provides resturants and shops of diverse styles at reasonable prices. There are also many shops close by also within walking distance that provides for most of your needs. One problem which we experienced was the drive into the facility. It gets a bit crowded during the busy check in and out times getting the family, luggage unloaded, but the hotel staff attempts to process you as quck as possible, and provides good instructions as to parking and access alternatives once you are booked in. We read that problems were occuring at check in and with the resort elevators. We arrived about 3PM on Saturday and had no delays what so ever. For timeshare owners, and if you have a car, we recommend that you go to the Publix supermarket which is located about 2 miles north of the resort, to purchase your food and necessary needs. The hotel staff will give you specific directions, but it is easy to find. The hotel concierge staff were very helpful and provide some great advice and fantastic savings coupons for activities and resturants. Yes, during high activity periods, the elevators traffic did have some delays, a few minutes at most, but expected with the size of the facility and the number of patrons in the resort. One of the main attractions at the resort is the Lazy River tube float area. Fun for both children and adults alike. Also, the direct access to the beach from the resort is great with a shower rinse unit at the gate to clean off the sand. Let us highlight one point - there are safes in every facility for security of your personal property. We used the safe in our room, but forgot to remove our valuables upon checking out. Once we realized our problem the next morning, we quickly contacted the resort and they took quick positive steps to resolve our problem. They took proper steps to confirm who we were and went on to look into the problem. Within minutes they called back acknowledging that the possession were secured from the safe. The hotel security staff ascertained where we would like to have the items forwarded and took immediate actions to provide us with our items in a very timely and secure manner. The material was forwarded to us by overnight FedEx and we received all items within 24 hours. Wow!! What a relief and fantastice service by the Fairfield staff. Our thanks.

That was a great start to a great stay at Ocean Walk! Check in was quick, and soon we acquired a young bellhop named \u201cCharles\u201d who was very nice and treated us as if helping us was the only reason he came to work that day! We made polite conversation as I walked with him to our room as he carted our large amount of luggage; meanwhile, my husband parked the car in the south tower garage. He had no problems getting a parking spot. We left several times during our week-long stay and never had a problem getting a good spot (although I could see that if the resort was filled to capacity that it could be a problem). Be careful about walking/driving in the garages, though! Too many drivers are driving around the tight corners like they are the only ones there! Slow down, please! :-) We were blessed with an Ocean-front 1 Bedroom Deluxe on the 11th floor of the South tower near the back-end of the bandshell. We had room 1114 A and were thrilled with it. Upon entering, I gasped at how beautiful everything was and to see the ocean right outside of the sliding glass door. The unit was very clean with nothing missing, and the neat shapes that all the towels/washcloths were in made us almost not want to use them and mess them up! It was not perfect, but nearly so! The shower was a little tricky to get hot water from, but my clever husband figured it out and it worked (although I only used it once and enjoyed the hot tub the rest of the time); we had to turn the knob all the way on in one direction until the water pressure left and then turn it back the other way very slightly where there was a very small \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d for hot water! (although not with as much water pressure as we\u2019d prefer). There was a stain on the carpet in one small area in the living room, but other than that, the blue carpet was very nice. You could see where a part of the microwave door had been broken and glued, but it wasn\u2019t an eyesore for me, just a close observation of mine. I loved the cheerful d\u00e9cor, the ocean-front balcony off of the living room was wonderful for watching fireworks from the pier and listening to a concert at the bandshell one evening. I enjoyed using the Jacuzzi nightly after my swim! There was never a problem with getting plenty of hot water for the Jacuzzi, by the way. The washer/dryer was a great help (I probably did 2 loads a day, our own clothing & freshening towels/swimsuits). The kitchen had all we needed for cooking and dining, and everything was in great shape. My husband and I thought that our King bed was very comfy, one of my sons comfortably slept on the queen sofa bed in the living room, and there was plenty of floor space in the living room for my other son to use his air mattress with sleeping bag. They are teen boys and will NOT sleep together! ;-) During the day, the air mattres was placed in the entryway closet out of the way. It was plenty of room for the 4 of us; we all loved our condo! I couldn\u2019t find any sheets/blankets for the sofa bed, so I called the front desk around midnight our first night there; they sent someone up within 15 minutes with clean sheets/blankets, which I thought was a reasonable wait. In everything, we found that we received wonderful service from the Ocean Walk staff! It was very hot during our stay, so doing anything outside other than swimming wasn\u2019t even a consideration for us. We loved being able to go to the 4th floor of the North tower to play putt-putt golf in the COOL A/C in the middle of the day when the sun seemed its hottest. This was free and a lot of fun for us. The resort offered many activities for all ages, but we opted to do our own thing for the most part. I think that a lot of people checked out during the weekend, so Sunday through Friday left the resort much emptier during our stay. Since the resort was not too full, the pools were never what I would call crowded. I don\u2019t know why, but pool wristbands were not used, nor given out during our stay. The lady at the front desk said that they weren\u2019t using them; I was glad for that! Some may have saved their pool chairs, but it was not very noticeable if they did; there were always some empty lounges (usually many were available). I do know that the pools were always open except between 6:45am and 8:15am (or sometime close to those times). During those times, they pressure-washed the pool deck (I watched them a few mornings) and there were no towels or other belongings anywhere near the pools or deck. If someone had gotten up before 6am to save a chair, either their stuff would\u2019ve gotten soaked or they would\u2019ve removed them (so nothing was ever sitting down there at that time during my stay). The beach was never crowded during our stay, and we loved the ease of going back and forth from pool to beach and vice-a-versa (there are showers & spickets to rinse the sand/salt off as you enter pool deck from beach). I loved the lazy river (never a line for it, but clearly very popular), although I did suggest on our comment card (that we turned in to the front desk) that there be periodic adult-only float times i.e. first 15 min. of every even hour. Kids can get really rowdy in the lazy river\u2026and it suddenly feels very UN-lazy during those times. There were some times that I could relax in the lazy river, although if it had been busier, I wouldn\u2019t think enjoying it would\u2019ve been as possible). We chose to attend a timeshare sales pitch our second day there and had a time window of being there anytime between 9am \u2013 3pm. It wasn\u2019t too bad and took about 90 minutes. We didn\u2019t buy, but thought that the $50 restaurant-of-our-choice gift card and 4 Free adult Daytona USA combo tickets (with track tour, worth over $30/person) were worth the time. There were several other choices in gifts available also. The resort never called us about attending, but we were pursued by a man in a Fairfield timeshare booth at the Ocean Village Shoppes. We had already planned on going anyway, so we didn\u2019t mind him asking us about it. All-in-all, we loved staying at the Ocean Walk Resort. My husband is pretty picky, and even he wants to go back whenever we take another beach trip! I could\u2019ve easily stayed 2 weeks instead of the 1 that flew by too quickly! The place is beautiful, and I know that my instant camera photos will not do it justice.", "Date": "August 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cRooms are fantastic, views are even better, not a place for relaxing\u201d", "Author": "mistyromine", "ReviewID": "UR3752611", "Content": "We loved our room it was great and the view of the ocean from it was spectacular.

We had been scheduled to go to Playa del Carmen to an all inclusive resort that week, but the night before our departure (really the early morning hours of our departure date) the forecast track for Hurricane Emily caused us to cancel our Mexican trip. We were all extremely dissappointed, having planned and looked forward to the trip for a long time. We were packed and determined to go SOMEWHERE, and were fortunate to get accomdations at Ocean Walk in Daytona, a 2 1/2 hour drive from our house. We had a huge 2-bedroom beautiful apartment on the corner of the 24th floor in the north tower. It was ocean front, with amazing views of the ocean and down Atlantic Blvd. The master suite had a jacuzzi tub, king bed, nice sitting area. The other bedroom had two double beds, a walk in closet and another large bathroom. There was a washer and dryer and fully equipped kitchen, including a blender for margaritas. We could only have that room for 2 nights. We then had one 1-bedroom for two nights, and two 1-bedrooms for three nights. The bellhops were very helpful, and stored our things the day we had to move. They even stored the refrigerated items for us. The next unit was in the south tower, (a little older) but was on the 18th floor and was beachfront with amazing views as well. It was smaller, with two double beds in the bedroom, a pull out couch, but a fully equipped kitchen with bar, VCR, and a washer and dryer as well. The bathroom was a little smaller but still nice. We didn't have to move after two nights. We just added another unit which was on the 12th floor for the boys. The girls absolutely loved the resort. There were constant activities with the game room, putt putt golf, internet access, and video games. There were tons of teenagers and they made some friends. The 17 yr olds loved the location at the boardwalk, and loved the fitness room. The hotel connects to the shops at the Boardwalk, which was really convenient. There were live bands at the bandshell and fireworks several of the nights. The hotel is beautiful, with entertainment by the pool during the day. It was the closest thing to the all-inclusive resort we could have found in terms of activities for the kids and entertainment. We did have to play the \"towel game\" every morning to get a shaded spot by the pool. The security guards actually would not let anyone on the pool deck before 8:00 A.M. to reserve a spot, so what ended up happening was everyone waiting by the door (some actually kind of hiding in the bushes - really!!!) and then at 8:00 making a mad dash to get your preferred spot. We were lucky and were able to get shaded tables at the pool with views of the ocean every day. One man actually fell running to get a spot one of the days. He got back up though and did get his spot! I noticed people coming down around 9 still able to get chairs by the pool, but if it was much later than that, they were taken. I also noticed the beach in front of the hotel was really crowded, but we considered it a trade-off to put up with a more crowded beach in exchange for a full service resort with all of the activities and amenities it offered. If it were just my husband and I, I would opt for a condo on a less crowded, more laid back part of the beach. But with teens and preteens, they'd probably be bored and this resort fit their needs perfectly. They had movies for rent in the lobby. They had crafts every day, and board games, footballs, frisbees, boogie boards, etcetera that could be checked out at no charge. Worth noting is at The Eatery just off the lobby you can purchase a drink, and get free refills the rest of the day. They also have $1 soft ice cream cones, and reasonably priced blizzards that were deliciious. We deep sea fished. We parasailed just a few hundred yards down the beach, and Ocean Walk guests get a discount. The boys rented scooters to ride around town and the beach and had a blast. Bubba Gumps is a neat place with good food. We also like the North Turn restaurant down in Ponce Inlet. It's right on the beach and the food is good. We also played putt putt golf. There's plenty to do in the area. Next time we're going to rent a pontoon boat and go down the river. Check-in did take a while, and a few times the parking garage was over full, so people were parking in non-parking spots. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this resort for active families that like a lot of activity and want to be in the center of all the action. I'd recommend it over Adam's Mark, which is next door. But if you want a less crowded, more laid back atmosphere, I'd pick something in Ormond Beach or Daytona Beach Shores. This truly is a full service resort with all the bells and whistles, beautiful rooms, and the kitchens and washers and dryers are big pluses.", "Date": "August 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mason, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cA honest review of the resort.\u201d", "Author": "sweetiepie", "ReviewID": "UR3729899", "Content": "I rented from a private owner at the resort.He had unit #1108 in the south tower.It was a one bedroom condo with a oceanfront view.I think renting from a owner is a better option than the resort.The first reason is price.I only paid $121.00 a night including tax and cleaning fees for 7 nights.If I would of rented thru the resort it would of been around $189.00 a night before taxes.I think the owners keep their rooms nicer in the long run.The resort treats your needs the same if you rent from a private owner.We got all the sheets,towels,paper towels,dish soap,laundry powder,shower soap and shampoo,lotion,and toliet paper we needed.The only negative about renting from an owner is you do not get daily maid service.The room has all the dishes and pots and pans you need to cook.The washer and dryer was very handy.I used it once a day to fresh up pool towels and bathing suits.I also like the nick nacks on the selves in the room.This made it feel more homey. When we arrived the pull in was full of cars and crowed.The security guard was very helpful out front telling people to go ahead and pull into the parking garage.There is two parking garages in front of the building on each side of the the north and south tower.The south tower is older.The resort seemed to be easy to figure out.When you park there is 8 floors in the south parking garage which coressponds to the floors the rooms are on.The Lobby is L in the elevator.The parking never seem to be a problem but,the spaces did seem to be narrow.We really did not ever really need to drive anywhere.We could walk to most things during our week stay. The lobby was packed full of people around 4:00p.m. on Saturday when we checked in.The owner I rented from allows us to check in at 2:00p.m. in the Vip lane.I believe it only took me about 10 mins. to check in the Vip lane but,the resort regular resort line looked to be at least an hour long.I am so glad I rented from a private owner after seening that line.The resort has a guy doing magic tricks for the kids in the lobby.They were also giving out coloring books and crayons for the kids.I thought that was cool.There were many bell boys getting peoples bags.We decided we would would rather do our own. We went up to our room and it was beautiful and clean.Our room was missing some items such as soaps,extra towels and such.I called the front desk and they brought up everything I needed without any problems.They were a little slow about it but,I think it was because the resort was so busy.The maid that had that brought our items was a nice young man that was 19.He was nice and Friendly.We chated for a while.He told me he works 8 am to 12 midnight 5 nights a week.He seemed cheerful and said he loves his job.I saw him almost everyday.He was always working hard and stopped to talk to me. The elevators were crowed and slow most of the time.We really didn't seem to mind, we had that problem at many other resorts we have stayed at in the past.A secret is just get in rather or not it is going up or down when the elevators seem busy. The resort had a week of activities set for the kids as well as the families.It changed every week.We decided not to do any of them.We like to relax and do our own thing.The activities room,game room,and indoor pool,gift shop and work out room is on the LL ( lower lobby). The outdoor pools were pressure washed and cleaned every am about 7:00.I believe they cleaned for almost 2 hours every am.People went out to put towels on the chairs about 7:00 and by 9:00 when the pool was open there were no open chairs.We did not seem to mind because we did'nt drive over 900 miles to use the pool.We went for the beach.The pool area would clean out a little by 3:00 pm.We went to pool then.My 2 year old just loved the kiddie pool.It has a small waterslide and steering wheels that turn on sprouting water.My 13 year old loved the pool with waterfall and waterslide.I loved the lazy river ride.I did it everyday.The line was long but, it was worth the wait.I also like the fact the resort has life guards at the pools.The pool was opened all night except the kiddie pool and lazy river.We never got in the other pool that had water volleyball set up in it.They had a DJ almost everyday from 10:00-2:00.They have a great pool side bar but I could not figure out their hours.They were open everyday but,They stayed open all different times. I loved how the resort had Ocean walk Village shoppes and restaurants connected to the 4th floor south tower bulding.You did not have to walk in the heat on the outside if you didn't want to.They have Bubba Gumps seaffod restaurant,Adoba Gila's Mexican bar and Restaurant,Cold stone Creamery,Johnny rockets,Harley Davdison shop,Mauxi Nix Surf shop,and a few other places.The resort has a small food court in the lobby but we never ate at it.The resort also has a lobby lounge with Karoke. The resort also has free putt-putt on the 4th floor in the north tower.You have to sign out putters and balls on the Lower lobby at the activties desk.We had fun doing putt-putt.You can also putt-putt around the pool area. The resort seemed to have tons of kids and teens running around everywhere.The security guards seem to have all of them under control.I noticed most parents were not watching their kids. I was very disappointed I never really got to get the Hot tub at night.The teens took over it at the night.My husband didn't like the fact we had to wear pool wrist bands at the pool.I didn't mind.I never saw anyone checking them anyway. The congeige desk was helpful with discount tickets and making reservations for us.The timeshare sharks never bother us not once maybe because we rented from a private owner?

Overall, we had a great stay, but we did run into some problems and inconveniences that diluted our experience somewhat. First of all, let's get this out of the way: Daytona Beach and the resort are both BEAUTIFUL. The Ocean Walk Resort is situated in a prime location on the beach, near the boardwalk and the Main Street Pier. It is connected to the open-air Ocean Walk Shops Mall and is a short drive away from both Publix and Winn-Dixie grocery stores. A few weeks prior to traveling to Daytona Beach, I spoke with a Fairfield representative who asked if I had any questions about the resort or my stay. I asked if they had any idea where in the resort we would be staying, since I have heard that there are SIGNIFICANT differences in room types based on whether you get a so-called \"A\" unit or a \"B\" unit, as well as which tower you are staying in (the north tower or the south tower). I was informed we would be staying in room 1822A, which is a great room with a great ocean view in the newer North Tower. When we arrived at the hotel at approximately 6:00 PM on Saturday, May 7, we were told we were in (I believe) Room 416 in the South Tower. I was somewhat confused because obviously this was not what I was told before. When we arrived in our room, we found it to be absolutely gorgeous, very spacious, with a whirlpool tub and very tasteful art-deco decorating. It also had two balconies, which overlooked... a parking deck and crosswalk for the outside mall. We were disappointed since we had gone to significant effort and expense to try to get a view of the ocean (this trip was the first time either of us had ever been to the ocean). When we called the front desk, we were rudely informed that there was nothing that could be done and that specific room assignments were not made in advance. We decided not to let our disappointment about the view ruin our vacation, and determined that the room itself was otherwise perfect and nicer than anywhere else we'd ever stayed before. An exploration of the hotel revealed a nice game room, an adults-only lounge, a computer room, an activity room for children, a small indoor mini-golf course, a gift shop, a well-equipped exercise room, an indoor golf practice area, two indoor pools, three outdoor pools, a lazy river, a poolside bar area, an indoor bar and a cafeteria-style cafe. There was also an area where an artist would draw portraits and characatures in one of the two lobbies and there always seemed to be some sort of activity going on, from a book sale in the lobby to a karaoke night at the bar. We were told upon checking in that we should visit the Concierge Desk for a \"free check-in gift\". Being hip to Fairfield's wily ways, we were well aware that this was a ruse to get us to attend a time-share pitch, but we thought we would humor them and see what was being offered. The deal on the table was gift certificates to various area restaurants in exchange for going on a tour of the hotel where we were staying and spending a couple hours telling a very insistent salesperson that we didn't want to buy a timeshare. It's debatable whether $60 worth of gift certificates is worth losing 2-3 hours worth of your time, but we went along with it and got the gift certificates without having to spend a dime. The salesperson was very phony and snooty, and the high-pressure tactics are very see-through to anyone familiar with sales techniques. The concierge desk was by far the most helpful aspect of the hotel. A very pleasant older lady with an accent (we sadly didn't catch her name) provided us with a lot of excellent information about local attractions and restaurants. ALL of her suggestions were spot-on and without her advice we probably would have missed out on some very memorable aspects of our trip. Her most helpful advice came when she was signing my fiance up for a complimentary Mary Kay spa treatment, and tried to automatically write down our room number as \"1822A\". Upon questioning her about it, it became evident that we truly WERE supposed to be in that room. After listening to our ordeal with the front desk, she provided a phone number to a man she said would do his best to pull strings to help us. And he absolutely did. This man listened to our problem and contacted the hotel manager, who contacted the night manager with instructions to move us to room 1822A. We were moved that evening, by the same man who had told us he couldn't move us! Our second room, then, was in the newer tower. It had a different decorating scheme and was even more gorgeous than the first room (both were one bedroom suites). The kitchen and dining area were larger and the view of the ocean from the 18th floor was absolutely breathtaking. We truly had no complaints whatsoever about the second room. We could see the beach, the boardwalk, the outdoor pools, the bandshell, the pier, and ocean as far as the eye could see, not to mention spectacular sunrises. We went to Saint Augustine one of the days of our trip, and the conceirge desk was helpful in that respect once again, providing plenty of brochures and coupons for attractions in the area, and providing advice on the best sites to see while we were there. The concierge also informed us of the Sterling Casino Cruise Line, which is basically a casino on a huge cruise ship that sails three miles off Florida's coast. The trip is about four hours and features table games, slot machines (even nickel slots), several lounges with great live entertainment, a free deli buffet, free drinks, and a great experience on a real cruise ship. There are a couple of cruises per day -- I recommend the sunset cruise, which was about 8 to midnight. The ship leaves from Port Canaveral, which is about an hour away from Ocean Walk -- but a shuttle bus takes you to and from the dock, so you don't even have to worry about driving (and you have a ready-made designated driver). The entire cost of all this: the shuttle, the cruise, the buffet, the entertainment, everything... is $5.00 per person. And you are not required to gamble, either. Neither me nor my fiance are gamblers: we only gambled with $20.00 for the whole night and finished down about five or six bucks. But we had a great time and you just couldn't beat it for the price. The beach outside the resort is perfect. The ocean is a great time also, but just be aware that when the sun starts setting behind the buildings you have to chase the sunlight if you're laying out in the sun. Another thing to keep in mind if you go swimming out into the ocean: stay aware of the riptide warnings, which are posted on the back of the lifeguard chairs. The currents can be extremely strong, particularly at high-tide. A wave hit my fiance and I out in the ocean and the riptides pulled us quite a distance from shore. My fiance is not a strong swimmer and although I am, the riptide was stronger than both of us. My fiance was in quite a bit of trouble and I was having a difficult time trying to help her. Luckily, the lifeguards are very alert and observant and quite good at what they do and tragedy was averted. The boardwalk area is fantastic. I haven't been to other boardwalks so I cannot compare this one to anything, but this boardwalk was quite fun. It is lined with eateries, ice cream shops, gift shops, arcades and other attractions. We managed to win enough tickets playing skee ball to get a nice souvenier shot glass from one of the arcades. All-in-all, Daytona Beach is a great place to vacation and the Ocean Walk Resort is a fantastic place to stay. The extremely friendly, genuinely helpful people at the resort seem to more than make up for the somewhat rude, unhelpful people on the staff. And as for the rooms, the location, and the amenities -- they are top notch. There is a good chance we may return to this resort on our next trip to Daytona Beach. -- BBR", "Date": "July 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cOnly Place to Stay In Daytona\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3577798", "Content": "We absolutely love the Ocean Walk!!!

When our confirmation arrived, we had been UPGRADED to a 3 BR just for taking a handicap room. We immediately called and invited 2 girls from our college Sunday School class, who GLADLY accepted. We spend all day long either at the beach or pool with our children, and most of the time in the evenings also, but this gave us a chance to have 2 nights out with ADULT conversation without leaving the grandparents to BABYSIT- after all, it is their vacation also!! One evening after we all returned from dinner, my husband and I wanted to see a late movie, so we left the kids with the sitters and walked next door to the theater, what a convenience for us. The condo set up gave us our own private master bedroom, with jacuzzi tub and seperate shower and ocean front balcony while the children had seperate beds (full beds in 2nd bedroom) and the sitters had their own room with 2 full beds. The children would share our bathroom since I kept their clothing with me which gave the older girls the 2nd bathroom to themselves. It had a roll in shower instead of tub, but they were fine with that. It was extremely roomy so they could both get ready at the same time on the nights when they were going out alone. My parents had a seperate 1 BR, which they loved, giving them their privacy and peace and quiet. The hardest thing was arguing over who was getting up at 7:00 a.m. on vacation to go down and reserve chairs- I know it isn't fair, but it was necessary to have a seat at 8:30 after we had breakfast and headed down to the pool and beach for the day. We scheduled consecutive time slots for our children mid day in the video room (PS2, Xbox, or something of that sort) and it was a nice break for them AND for us. The room is right inside from the pool which made it convenient for us to lounge peacefully while they took a break and then we could walk right inside to pick them up when they were finished. Also, lunch by the pool is great, (hot dogs, burgers, grilled chicken, etc) and we could all eat for around $10 or $12 dollars, which was worth not going up to the room some days. When it rains, the indoor golf kept our kids busy. Adobe Gila's was not impressive for us, but we love Bubba Gumps and look forward to spending July 4th at Ocean Walk in a few weeks. Gotta start packing!!!

We took our 15 year old son, 17 year old daughter, and 24 year old daughter with us. We have 4 children and we faithfully take a vacation every year. Through the years we have always looked for something the children would enjoy and every year we come back more exhausted than when we left. Trying to entertain 4 children and fight the long lines and traffic left us drained! This year was different though. When we parked the car in the parking garage, it didn't move until we left for home. Everything we needed was right there! One evening it was to the movies, one shopping, playing games in the arcade room, playing gooney golf, swimming, dining at really good places and much more. Our room was a 2 bedroom oceanfront and it was fantastic! We had 3 balconies all ocean view, two bathrooms, 2 refrigerators and stoves, all the utensils you could ever use. It was quiet and super clean. Around 9:00 am every morning maid service was there to clean our room and restock it and they did an excellent job. No one bothered us the whole time we were there. The only complaint I would have is they give you no layout of the hotel. I had studied the hotel out and knew they had alot of activities but didn't have a clue to where they were. So we began to explore and asked a security person, which was not helpful at all. We returned to the main desk and they said they didn't have anything to show the layout. We then found another desk where a lady that apparently sales their time share, gave us the information after asking us if we would be interested in buying. She did not pressure us after that and answered all our questions. All the game rooms and activities were on LL (lower lobby) the golf supplies are checked out on LL but the actual game is on the 4th floor. The fourth floor is also the exit hall to the movie theater and shops. We had the best experience with our vacation this year than ever before. We came home rested and can't wait to go back again!

First of all the weather was great for mid-May and it wasn't that crowded. It definitely gets more crowded on the weekends and I can understand people's complaints about the pool chairs being taken. It's true. I would not want to come here in June-July-August. There are only four elevators that service the north tower and although the wait was never too, too long sometimes the elevator would come and it would be full. The resort itself is great. There are two outdoor pools, three hot tubs and a good sized children's pool plus a lazy river. The children's pool is not heated and you can tell. There are also two indoor pools. There are two rooms with computers with free internet access. There is a game arcade room for the kids plus an activity center with free playstation and a huge plasma tv to play them on. The rooms were very nice although our oceanfront balcony was concrete and you had to stand up to be able to see out. Other balconies are not so ask when you call. We rented through a private party and were considered guests of the hotel so we got daily maid service. The only other negatives are the noise. The smaller lock off units face the hall and people talk loudly and slam doors at 3am. We had both sides of the unit. The kitchen was fully furnished with everthing from pots and pans to dishwasher detergent. They even give you laundry detergent. My husband and I, our three year old and my parents had a really good stay. Daytona, itself, isn't that exciting although there are some good restaurants around. If you are there for the beach and the pool you'll love it. We also found the front desk staff helpful. Any maintenance issue we had was addressed very quickly.

My wife and I stayed at the Ocean Walk the week of May 7 - 14th. First, I think people need to remember they are staying at Daytona Beach not South Beach and are paying $140 a night instead of $400. If you keep this in perspective then you will be very happy with the Ocean Walk Resort. Our room was very nice and most importantly clean. We had a 1 bedroom in the south tower it was big almost like a one bedroom apartment with a kitchen and small washer and dryer. One downside was the housekeeping. Their did not seem to be any consistency the only thing I know they did in our room was replace the towels otherwise I don't think they did anything. I have read many people complaining about the pool, so let me give you some advice. First, you do have to go down and reserve a chair before around 9 AM if you want to have a chair that is going to be in the sun until 3 PM. I recommend the chairs lined along the fence next to the beach at the south tower pool. These chairs stay in the sun until at least 3PM, chairs closer to the hotel start getting shade around 1 to 1:30. If you want sun all day just go down to the beach. If you do go to the beach you have to pay $25 to rent chairs, umprella etc. The vendor is on the beach. Life guards do keep an eye on everyone just making sure they don't get to far off of shore. Finally, this is a family resort. If you came to get away from kids then this is not the resort for you. Remember more than half the units in this resort are time shares so families do come to these places to stay. Plus you are only 60 miles from Disneyworld once again a good reason why their are so many kids at the resort. My wife and I don't have kids but still managed to relax and have a great time. You will love the resort if you don't let the little things bother you and remember you are at the beach so life could be worse.", "Date": "May 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cAWESOME VACATION!\u201d", "Author": "ctrose14", "ReviewID": "UR3427761", "Content": "We went to Ocean Walk the 3rd week in April 2005.

It was great that I could cook breakfast and dinner in the room to save money, then we could splurge more at lunch when we went sightseeing. The resort offered daily activities for kids (and teens) ranging from sandcastle building, various crafts (for a nominal fee) to karaoke that was all supervised by Ocean Walk staff. They had plenty for the kids to do to keep busy and for a fee, parents could get away one night during the week to spend alone while their kids were cared for. The pool area was great, though one of the pools was unavailable due to some repairs, but there was still the kiddie pool, lazy river and other large pool, not to mention the indoor pools and the HOT TUB (which was heaven!)

We were arriving separately due to the fact I was just returning from Iraq. The room was paid for in cash including a cash deposit. After I waited in a very short line for almost 30 minutes, I was rudely greated by the staff. No greating what so ever. All she said was I need your credit card. I explained to her everything was previously paid for including the deposit. I need it for identification. I explained I would give her any picture ID she needed but she didn't need my credit card for identification. After that went on for some time the manager stepped in, needless to say I did not have to give my credit card. This was after a 20 minute dispute. We were supposed to have an OF room but didn't. Everytime we returned to our room, or to the parking garage for that matter the keys didn't work. One time I was by myself and had to go back in to the lobby so the could give me a new key. I was in there no more that a minute when the security guard came in screaming that I needed to move my car. Even though there were several other cars out there, I was not blocking the flow of traffic. I asked were can I move it to? His response was I don't care just move it. There were teenagers in the pool after 11pm practically having sex and drinking in the pool; cursing up a storm. There were no remotes for ANY of the 3 TV's in the room and when we requested them they said they should be in there and couldn't give us any. Parking was atrocious. Before arriving we had informed them we would have 2 cars, they said it wasn't a problem. It sure wasn't for them. We had to park our 2nd vehicle at the public garage and pay 15 dollars a day. There \"food court\" is the worst. You are better off going to 7-11. I have been treated better at a Super 8 than I had been treated here.

The concierge was a lot of help suggesting restaurants (such as Inlet Harbor) and finding out info on Universal Studious and St. Augustine. We also saw a big movie star by the pool and heard of another one staying there, so I defiantly think it\u2019s one of the nicest hotels in Daytona. The only complaint I\u2019d have is housekeeping. The room was clean when we checked in and we got enough clean towels, but our dirty towels stayed in a heap on the bathroom floor for 3 days and our sheets never got changed (but, it didn\u2019t bother me enough call the front desk to request room service). I totally recommend staying here. It\u2019s nicely located and is just a nice hotel. I will defiantly be staying here again.", "Date": "February 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vermont", "Title": "\u201cDont understand how anyone can give this place a bad review.\u201d", "Author": "davel33", "ReviewID": "UR3233737", "Content": "The ocean walk resort is incredible. We rented from a broker for a heck of a discount. Stayed Mon Feb,21st in a 2 bedroom in the new tower and the next 4 nights in a 2 bedroom in the old tower. Total cost was about 90 dollars a night. The suites were 1300 square feet. The first one was very luxurious with a side balcony. The one in the old tower was equally as nice but the furniture wasn't as nice, but it had an oceanfront balcony. The furniture was still much nicer than in any regular hotel Ive ever stayed at. The units have full kitchens and washer/dryer too plus jacuzzis. 2 bathrooms. Awesome pools. Absolutely the best place in the area. With all the activities and things for the kids to do we saved a ton of money that we would normally spend taking the kids to the parks,etc.....We also did a little grocery shopping and saved a ton on eating out as well. There is no construction whatsoever going on at this resort. One building next to the new tower is being refinished but doesn't affect this place at all. The Hilton at Ocean Walk is on the other side of the Ocean walk Village and that is being remodeled. I huess it was just purchased by Hilton and maybe people giving reviews are confusing the 2 places, but from what I saw most of the Hilton looked great too. Fairfield definitely has more to offer for kids and families though. The only time we were approached about a timeshare was by someone on the beach trying to get us to tour the Royal Floridian. Fairfield guest services left a card on our door offering a tour but we were never asked by anyone. On the last day we were there it was cloudy and rainy and we wanted a peek at the penthouse so we called them and set up a 45 min tour which turned into an hour but there was no pressure to buy and we got a 60 dollar meal at Ponce Inlet for it. As far as the 1 bedroom B units, some of them do face the hall but they are still lovely and remember that its a one bedroom studio not a condo. Just one more thing....In the older tower #1 only about 20% of the rooms are actually owned by Fairfield and the others are individually owned and rented by others so any poor service complaints may be due to who they rented from. We loved it and would definitely return there.

Had originally looked on internet for booking a room and found it through Expedia. Thinking I could get a better deal directly w/ this hotel , I called. Asked for the same dates and there was no rooms available. The reservation desk at the hotel said I better book asap through Expedia. I did, and got a room for approximately $140 per night. It was on the 18th floor directly looking over the beach and ocean. When you first walk in the rooms, it gives one a feel of a small Bermuda design. Soft yellow walls w/ tile floors. As soon as you walk in the room,you are in a small but quaint foyer,with a small table with a light.As you go around the corner it opens into a big room, with a fully equipped kitchen. In front of the kitchen divided by a small 1/2 wall is the living room with tables, and 2 fold out couches, tv,phone, and a balcony of 8X4,accessible via a sliding patio door. There are two entrances into the bedroom, which is its own room with in itself. Has big closet, window over looking ocean/beach, a Jack and Jill bath with full size \"jaccuzi\" tub, and a seperate single sink bath with walk in shower,toliet,etc.. It was extremely clean and had a room safe and iron/board in closet. The outer hall by kitchen has its own stackable washer and dryer along w/ 2 small boxes of Tide detergent. Each bath had own towels,plus additional in closet. Small extra blankets and pillows also avail. Over all, great beach feel, and you feel very welcome. The lobby is next to elevators, and accessible with no problem. There is a \"u \" shaped bar, made of dark wood, and always staffed. Check in was ok, Arrived at noon, knowing ck in was at 4pm. Was told room would be ready at 2. Had lunch at the pool,cked on room at 3, still not ready, but hey... I was early. At 4 room not ready, but went to VIP area of ck in as bartender told them I was coming over. They said, the room had been ready since 1pm, it was a computer glitch. I was fine, as the extra time let me enjoy the pool area,sun and more drinks. Got a free drink at bar for mistake. The next day, came back from being out, and room key would not work. Went down, stood in ck in line for 20 minutes, so I thought, I'd try VIP line again, they stated the key to room was malfunctioning, and reset it immediatly. There was never a time that I was pressured into looking at a time share as others mentioned. I did find it \"quirky\" that a magician was trying to get you to come over to his table of tricks in the lobby, I am sure to hook one on the time share. Never ate here, but has a small cafe attached to bar. Went to the Hilton for breakfast buffet. Otherr than that, all pools,2 hot tubs and lazy river were working. There is a hugh work out room. Heard to have a spa very soon. Indoor pool seemed nice ,but didn't partake. Over all not the Ritz, but a nice experience.

I travel for business often (airlines) and am also a RCI and Fairfield owner. I have become very a custom to being treated special at Ocean Walk and knowing the staff will immediately respond to any concerns, however on my last trip my room was filthy and the service was unpleasant! Check in was slow and uninviting took 1 hour after check-in time to get keys to room (two out of three keys worked)! Parking was difficult when I checked-in. When I brought this to managements attention (people not parked in spots total anarchy), and a young blond male manager who was on duty asked how would I feel if I was towed??? I parked across the street in public parking for six dollars a day and asked for a voucher I was told they didn't do that! I used to deal with Tara, or Tom however who were both quick to act on any concerns, and realized shortly after check-in both had transferred this was a problem!! I called several times for maid service and after actually speaking with someone at the front desk I was advised housekeeping had left for the evening! So I slept in a room with urine on the bathroom floor and debris on the carpet (there was no place to move me to). I was a paying hotel guest at the time and checked out the next day. Shortly I discovered I had been charged the entire stay on my credit card. I immediately called the resort and the sympathetic agent transferred me to the resort accountant. I left a message and waited three business days as a courtesy before calling back again. On my third call I received a short and rude message stating I had to call the resorts 1-800 # to receive credit back on my card and this process would take up to ten days. Further calls to the account went unanswered! When I finally got in touch with someone on the 1-800 who was a supervisor I received the third degree and was told they had no record of me checking out early. I called the resort accountant again no response, then the assistant resort manager Jon I think no response, and finally spoke with Maran (some manager who knew Tom). She was a god sent thank you! Finally three days latter I received my funds. I have stayed at Ocean Walk several times in both a timeshare and hotel capacity, and never had these kind of problems. I would never stay there again or recommend it (it used to be spotless and well managed).

Like one of the last reviews said, most of the places on the ocean were hit by the hurricanes. The Ocean Walk did not appear to get hit at all. We really enjoyed our stay. After reading many of the reviews posted, we were eager to see if the resort was all that everyone said it was. Our check in was pleasant except we were unable to check in until 4. We arrived at the hotel at 1, so we had some time to kill. We spent it out by the ocean and by the pools. If I could make a recommendation, I would like to see the Resort let guests check in if the room is ready. They said ours was not, but I'm not sure that was all true. Upon check in, we were given our ocean front room, as booked. We had an A room on the 14th floor. It was, for the most part, well kept. The only suggestions I would have is the carpet in the livingroom needed to be cleaned or a new one put in. The kitchen was well equipt and well kept. Having the mini washer and dryer in our room was a big plus. They gave us some detergent upon arrival but we went to the store to buy more. We needed an extra blanket which we had to call twice for, but it was delivered in about an hours time. We found the staff to be very polite and friendly as well as eager to make sure our stay was good. I must say that I was disappointed in the cleanliness of the shower. The shower floor looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a long time. Also, the maids only do light housekeeping.....make beds, empty trash and provide fresh towels. They don't clean your sink or bathroom at all unless you request it. I called the front desk and requested they clean the bathroom better. They did. Also, the housekeepers do not speak much english, so we were unable to communicate well with them. There was food in the hotel which made it nice. They had an inhouse breakfast and dinner once during the week for a nominal fee, which was nice so we didn't have to go out to get food. They did have a nice pool side cookout with tropical music on the nice days. We were also able to rent chairs and an umbrella on the beach for $25.00 for the day. It was worth it. The outside of the resort was well kept, clean and very nice to sit out and enjoy. The inside of the hotel all in all was well done. We would recommend this hotel to those who want to get away and spend some time at a nice resort as a family or as a couple. There are scheduled activities to do for the kids as well as a game room and computers. We had a one bedroom condo with a pull out sofa bed in the living room which was great for our 13 year old. Our bathroom even had a jacuzzi in it which we didn't use. The Daytona beach area is very run down, so if you are looking to do a lot of shopping or pretty sight seeing along the beach, this would probably not be the place to go, but if you are looking to stay at the hotel most of the time and enjoy the ocean and pool area I would recommend this hotel. I am a very picky reviewer, so I would guess that many people would have a great time at this Hotel. I've read that some people had difficulty with long check in and elevator wait, but we came off season and didn't have any trouble. I'll bet that on season or during a big event, the check in, elevator and parking would be a huge problem. Probably 15 minutes away is International Speedway Drive where you can shop and eat and visit the speedway. This area is well kept. Please beware, that many of the surrounding hotels are very run down. The Ocean Walk is a new resort and was worth far more than the fee of $113.00 per night we were charges.

I was very careful to read all of the reviews posted on this site, the good, the bad and the ugly and I took it all to heart. First we booked our reservation directly with the resort. That is the only way to get a straight answer on what kind of room you will be in. I was given a room number and a floor at booking and was told it could change, but it did not. We had two double beds on the 4th floor over looking the pool and the beach. That floor also goes directly out to The Ocean Walk Shops and has a back entrance to the pool. The only draw back was the constant stream of prospective condo owners that were courted every day by the staff. You will most likely receive a call to come to one of the meetings with the promise of food and drink gift certificates, but we respectfully declined and were never bothered again. We arrived at 6:00 PM on a Saturday night and had NO wait at check in. I found the check-in staff to be very helpful. We even extended our stay by one night and had no problems. If I could make a suggestion, I would say that you need to bring push pins or make some sort of make shift curtain to cover the window in your bedroom that faces the hallway. Thanks to the previous postings, I was able to cover ours with sheets, which helped block out the light. Also, it is true that you have to get up around 7:00 AM to put towels out on the chairs to get a spot at the pool. Management says \"No reserving chairs\", but everyone does it, so if you don't play the game, you will find yourself without a chair. We did see a fight between two families regarding \"moving their stuff\", but the hotel quickly accommodated the family that had saved the chairs earlier. Just know that you do take the chance of having your belongings moved aside, but this was the only case we saw in 7 days. Also bring extra laundry detergent if you plan on washing your own beach towels (I would bring my own beach towels), they do provide you with small amounts of detergent along with paper towels, trash bags, etc. , but we did the wash before returning home and ate breakfast in frequently, so we found it helpful to bring extra items. Light maid service is provided each day (taking out the trash, making beds and exchanging towels for clean ones). Our vacation was fabulous. The pool, water slide and lazy river were great, and we were within 45 minutes to 1 hour of Orlando, so we were able to go to Sea World for the day without a long drive after. Basically there is an element of uncertanty whenever you travel.

This particular unit did not have the A & B lockoff mentioned in other reviews, it was a 2 bedroom & 2 bath with 1 kitchen and 1 living room. The beach was beautiful, uncrowded, and just a few steps beyond the pooldeck. The pools (2 outside and 2 inside) and lazy river are perfect and relaxing. Check in was quick, sales pitches were in the form of a letter on the door daily (not a big deal), and check-out was smooth as well. They have a computer lounge with 3 terminals, fitness classes, and lots of activities that are free of charge. The gift shop is not overpriced, as I figured it would be and the arcade was well equiped as well. I have just a couple of somewhat negative remarks - there was sometimes a small wait for the elevators (the longest, probably 10 mins., when a storm blew in and the beach and pool deck were quickly closed causing everyone to need an elevator at the same time...the pool deck fills early so get there early if you want a chair...the parking garage can fill quickly in the evening (we never had a problem finding a spot, but there were several cars parked in non-spaces by the morning.) Finally, the resort is missing huge profit potential by not having an onsite convenience or grocery store (a large grocery is nearby.) If there would have been one there we would have used it even if it was a little more expensive. The decor and facilities are beautiful and we had a great time.

We had a great 1 bedroom ocean front room. The full fridge made breakfast and lunch very convient. My biggest complaint is that chairs by the pool were very hard to get. I don't know what time people got up to save the chairs but we would go down at 7:00am and there would not be a chair to be found. This should be stopped. Also the pool is in the shade by 3pm but I went there for the beach anyway. I would recommend this hotel for a Daytona stay. But would say that there are alot better places to go than Daytona Beach.", "Date": "July 1, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cNice place, Zero Customer Service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2225915", "Content": "Called ahead of time to check on rates, was quoted a price, they said come on in there are plenty of rooms at that rate. Upon arriving there were no such rates and the rates rose by $100 per night. Needless to say I was a little upset, asked for the manager, manager informed me there was nothing he could do. He offered no comprimise, no apoligies, nothing. I would have still stayed there had he at least apoligised that the info I rec'd came from the marketing company, not the hotel directly. I've stayed there before and the experience was nice. However since I received nothing resembling service, I left and stayed at a wonderful hotel Next door. I will not return to Ocean Walk.
