We went down stairs and told the staff did they have another room, but they said they were all the same, there was one a little bit bigger so we went up and had a look at that- not much better. Again the windows wouldn't lock. Again I said to my husband that know way I could stay here, very disappointing. We checked out. Clean and tidy, but that was about it.
