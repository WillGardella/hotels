Spend a weekend celebrating a birthday (Grandma's 95th) at the Marriott Waterfront Seattle. I have stayed in a couple other hotels in the city, but this was the most enjoyable. Aside from being a very comfortable and well staffed hotel at a reasonable price, the location of the Marriott Waterfront is ideal for a Seattle vacation. Staying here, we were afforded the quintissential view of the Sound and Olympic Mountains off our balcony. Watching the sun rise over the mountains as the ferry's rolled in and out across the Sound was a peaceful respite from a busy weekend. So peaceful, yet only a short three block stroll from Pike Place Market and the core Downtown area! This location is perfect. Starting our day walking through \"The Market\", with it's many bakeries and coffee shops was a perfect way to start our day as \"tourists\". From there, it's no more than a mile in any direction to access some of Seattle's must-see's. To the north, The Space Needle, Seattle Center, and Queen Anne Hill (don't forget to visit Kerry Park!). To the East, the retail core, museums, theaters, and Capitol Hill (home to some of the finest restaurants and people watching Seattle has to offer). To the South you'll find Seattle's oldest neighborhood, Pioneer Square and beyond that, SODO, where you can catch a soccer or baseball game and find some decent BBQ. Also, don't forget to stroll the Waterfront, which is right out the front door of the Marriott. Visit the Aquarium, Ivars (Seattle's most beloved fishhouse), and the multitude of quirky shops. The waterfront is a good way to spend an afternoon or a good starting point for one of the many boat tours you can enjoy. After a long day of touristing, the Marriott Waterfront is a great place to return to relax for the evening. It has all of the amenities you would expect: restaurants, gift shop, meeting rooms, swimming pool, and 24-hour gym.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wise, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cNot the usual Mariott quality\u201d", "Author": "Rohirrim_maiden", "ReviewID": "UR127322904", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for a conference in April 2012.

There was the standard fridge and coffeemaker in the room, wished that there had been a microwave. If you are staying for an extended period, I highly recommend asking for a room with a view. My view, was a sliver of bay/ocean front and the side of a parking garage. Also, there is a train track that runs right behind the hotel, and you will hear it, 2-3 times a night.

The Marriott Waterfront is in a lovely location right on Alaskan Way. Lots of sites to see on the waterfront, so we couldn't have asked for a better location. Pike Place was just a short 5 minute walk away. Our room was okay, but we did expect it to be a bit more luxurious due to the price we were paying $200++/night. Room and bathroom were spotless!! A+ to the housekeeping staff!! Beds were comfortable, but pillows were not. One complaint we had was our toilet. It was an automatic flushing toilet and the sensor was so sensitive, that it would flush any time we walked near the toilet. We asked the front desk to have a look into the problem. They sent their \"engineer\" up and the only solution they came up with was to leave the lid up and flush manually. We found this quite amusing. The blow dryer in the room is from the 1980's and needs to be upgraded ASAP, we found this totally unacceptable for a hotel of this caliber. The lobby is tastefully decorated and welcoming. Friendly bell & front desk staff!! A+ The Hook and Plow restaurant was okay, nothing incredible. I did find it strange that all the employees were wearing jeans though. Breakfast potatoes were not good....I didn't even eat them as they were so greasy. Now to the pool......it is absolutely horrible. Everything looks so dirty. The hot tub is small and needs to be replaced (maxium people it can hold is 4). I went into the pool area three days in a row, and the pool was not vacuumed once. Big piles of dirt in corner of pool. There is also lots of black stuff in the pool (I'm guessing mold on the walls). Floor tiles are dirty in the pool area. Basket with towels wasn't emptied for three days. There was some gum on a planter that wasn't removed for three days. I can't say enough how disgusting the pool area is. Definitely not up to Marriott's standards. As far as I am concerned, the pool needs to be shut down and renovated ASAP. I am very surprised that other reviewers have not mentioned the condition of the pool!

We stayed in a waterfront room, high floor, which has a front (vs. side) view out to the water and a balcony. This was great - but if it were cruise ship season, I wouldn't splurge for that as you would likely only see the side of the cruise ship. Bed was very comfortable, room spacious, with a nice sitting chair and a fairly large balcony. The weather was blustery so we didn't sit out there but it was wonderful to see the ferries come and go. The floor was high enough that you could leave the drapes open and no one from the street level could see you. (this would NOT be the case if the cruise ship were in port and were at floor level).

First, it has a great location right on the waterfront. It's within a block of the Aquarium and Bell Harbor Conference center, and a couple of blocks of the Pike St. Market. My room had a very small balcony with a view of the water, and it was fabulous to open the door and get the fresh air. The hotel is very clean with a sharp decor. The front desk was courteous and I was checked into my room in under 2 minutes even though I arrived several hours earlier than normal check-in time. I had a 2 double bed room which was quite spacious. The beds were very comfortable - not too soft or too hard - with good, although small, down pillows. The desk and task chair were perfect. Everything was clean and fresh. The thermostat and air conditioner worked great and were reasonably quite. The sound proofing is really good - I rarely heard anything outside my room. The bathroom is a little tight - I don't think you could have two people trying to get ready in it at the same time. I love the curved shower rods to make the shower feel more spacious. The hotel provides a rubber mat for the shower - make sure you use it because the tub is super slick. Water was reasonably soft and the temperature consistent. The hotel has free wireless, although it is *slow*. The wired internet is blazing fast and supposedly costs $13/day - but it didn't show up on my bill because it was included in my group rate. The room included a small refrigerator and a huge flat screen tv. My favorite feature, which I've never seen in a hotel before, was an adapter so you could watch your computer through the TV. They provide the VGA and audio cord and once connected, the TV automatically adjusted its settings to display the computer perfectly. One evening I watched a Redbox movie through the computer and another evening I watched HBOGo. This is a great, great feature - thank you Marriott! The adapter also has inputs for HDMI and RGA plugs. The closet was spacious with new wood hangers. The ironing board and iron were both new. The gym was clean, well lit, and well equipped with 4 treadmills, 2 recumbent bikes, and 2 elliptical machines - all of which were reasonably new, in good order, and had individual TVs. There were new, rubber dumbbells up to 50 lbs and two benches that can be inclined. Towels, water, and inexpensive headphones were free. One of the best gyms I've seen for a hotel. I did not bring a bathing suit this trip but will on future ones. The pool was large for a hotel and was neatly designed to be half indoors and half outdoors. There was also a hot tub that was calling my name after hiking through Seattle for a few hours. When I woke up on my last day my receipt was waiting for me in the room. You can check out through the TV or call the front desk. You can also ask the front desk to email you a copy of the bill - nice feature for the business traveler. Check out time is a generous 12 PM.

The reality is you really have to stretch to see the water, and there isn't a normal seating arrangement in the room that allows boat watching.

Previous experience of Marriott hotels in the UK had been so good that we looked no further than the Waterfront as it offered us proximity to both the pier and downtown Seattle. Unfortunately we were extremely disappointed on the eve of our cruise, not with the accommodation itself, but because it simply failed to match the Marriott experiences we had in England. The rooms on both days were clean and comfortable and the view across the waterfront splendid. However, we have been used to a full English breakfast being included in the price, bottled water supplied without charge and ample tea and coffee making facilities in the room. This is where the Waterfront fell well short of expectation and bearing in mind the price we can honestly say we have experienced far better in from 3* hotels and B&B accommodation. On returning at the end of our cruise we actually checked in at 10.30am and was told our room would not be available until 1.00pm. We expected no more and, having left our baggage in their care, spent the rest of the morning exploring the city. We returned at 2.00pm only to be informed that the room would not be available until 4.00pm. Our opinion of Marriott Hotels had taken a severe hammering. Is it asking too much of an hotel that charges $334.08 a night and can equip a room with 12 lights and 8 pillows to at least provide breakfast, a minibar and ample tea and coffee making facilities?

I was visiting family in Olympia and we decided to travel to Seattle for the fireworks, and then easy access to Sea-Tac airport for me to leave the next day. We arrived around 4pm and checked in with no problem. I had a special rate for the room and my total for the stay including parking was $125 however the front desk authorized my debit card for $175. I'm not sure why they held so much, but it was a little irritating since it tied up my funds for the night. There were some old room service plates outside our door when we arrived at our room, however the room was clean. I'm not sure why they were not removed. Bell services promptly delivered our luggage after check-in, but did not remove the plates, and housekeeping quickly delivered extra towels but also did not remove the plates. They stayed there for the whole duration of our stay. The room itself was very well decorated. The bathroom and TV were both great. My only complaint about the room itself is that it had two full size beds rather than queen size. If there wasn't so much \"extra\" furniture, like the corner chair and table by the window, I think queens would have fit. The location of the hotel could not be beat. It was directly across from the water with easy walking access to the restaurants, shops and attractions on the water in either direction. There was a lack of parking in the area so we were forced to use valet parking for $34, however we encountered no problems with valet. While we were there, the hotel was one of the host hotels for a national Lions club convention that was in town. The news reported to expect thousands in the city and to expect ample traffic due to the parade the following day. Because of this, I decided to stop at the Concierge desk to ask about the best route to the airport the next day and also where we should watch the Lake Union fireworks without going to the crowded Gasworks Park. We were waiting at the Concierge desk for just a few minutes behind a couple receiving directions, when the Concierge leaned over and said to us very rudely: \"I'm finishing with this group and then I have to go, can you see if the front desk can help you?\" I told her the line at the front desk was long and she seemingly rolled her eyes and said \"I'll be right with you\". I stood there for a minute baffled that she would end her shift without helping us when Marriott is so big on customer service, and also why we would want to check with the front desk when the Concierge is supposed to be the knowledgable one in the hotel about this. A few minutes later, she leaned over again asking us what we needed. I told her and she rolled her eyes and sighed and said \"well there's eight restaurants on Lake Union where you can see fireworks\". I stopped her right there. I did not ask for restaurant recommendations and I certainly wasn't going to take quick recommendations to get rid of me while she was still helping the first people. She was useless. I went outside and asked the bellman who was about 20 years old. Though he did not know much in regards to what I was asking, he was much more pleasant and helpful. At check-out, the front desk clerk gave us great directions to the airport avoiding the parade route, which contradicted the bellman's directions from the previous night which actually crossed the parade route. I was disgusted with this Concierge experience and thought that since this Lions club convention was staying there, perhaps they should have been more well staffed and prepared for questions like this. We did not get to use the pool but it was very nice with both indoor and outdoor features, and the workout room was a great size with nice offerings. Regardless of my one bad experience, I would choose to stay here again if the price was right because of the location, amenities and decor.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kelowna, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, but not as nice as I was expecting\u201d", "Author": "lag746", "ReviewID": "UR115036377", "Content": "When we first got to Seattle we stayed at the Courtyard in Pioneer Square for two nights. It really was a great hotel. Everything I had requested was given to me on the first shot. I will be writing another review for that location but it definitely put my expectations high for the waterfront considering it's more expensive. The lobby at the waterfront was also deceiving because it's really nice so I was expecting a lot. I get a marriott associate rate, so I'm not sure if that was why they put me in the worst room possible at first. I know it's not guaranteed, but I requested a high floor room with 1 king sized bed. Instead I got a 3rd floor room with 2 double beds so quickly I asked to be changed. They put me in a room on the 2nd floor with a king bed but considering our rate, I wasn't too picky. When we got to the 2nd floor, it stank like old stale dusty... I don't even know. That's fine it's not like I'm hanging out in the hallway but when we got into the room it was worse. There was no ventilation and when I looked out the window we faced a concrete wall and below was the valet parking. When I went into the bathroom, it smelt like somebody had just pooped in it. I was tired and I didn't want to change rooms, but there was no way I was using the bathroom. Also the hotel is badly laid out so the walk from the elevator to the room was really long. The front desk lineup was a nightmare, there were only 2 people working and the lineup just kept forming. When I finally got to the front, I asked for a room change. The nice front desk guy (different from the first one) put me on the 6th floor and in a good location where I could see the waterfront. The room was well ventilated. I was much happier. However did I really have to do 2 room changes in order for me to get a decent room? As for the room itself, the carpets were ugly and the walls were a bit too thin for my liking. I could hear kids yelling in the bathroom from beside me when I was in the bathroom. I also heard toilets flushing and people dropping things etc. In Courtyard Pioneer, I didn't have that issue. I couldn't hear anyone there. I was hoping they'd have a mini fridge and there wasn't one supplied. Courtyard had one. Apparently there is no free internet at this hotel either but I was close to the lobby and was able to get the Wifi reception from down there.

There is a restaurant affiliated with the hotel, but we ate our meals out, so I can't rate the bistro restaurant. Parking is $34 per night.

We even walked the 2 miles to the other cruise port to see the other cruise lines including our favorite - Royal Caribbean. Only Celebrity and NCL use the port directly in front of the hotel. You'll find traffic back ups in the morning when a ship arrives in port. It was an easy walk, although probably too steep for some people, to Pike Place. If you like Seattle downtown nightlife, this isn't the place for you. There is a not so nice area to walk through when coming back to the hotel from downtown. This area is called bell town.

The city was surprisingly small and easily manageable compared to what I was expecting. I thought of something more along the scale of Vancouver, Canada... but the city core was much smaller. Seattle has also done a great job of integrating their marine and fishing history into the city. We couldn't have asked for a better hotel location as it was right on the waterfront, only a couple of blocks from Pike Place Market, and only about a 15-20 minute walk from the Space Needle. The hotel itself was a bit of an older version of a standard Marriott, but had the nice comfy beds you come to expect from the brand (and one of the main reasons I stay). My room was supposed to have a king sized bed, but I suspect it was a queen as it seemed much smaller than our king size at home. The room is standard, with a flat screen TV and a small refrigerator if you have some snacks or drinks to keep cool. Most rooms seems to have a view of the water, we were on the 3rd floor and had a decent view. We did hear the train come by a couple of times as it is right behind the hotel, but it isn't loud enough to disturb your sleep. When we first opened the door we did smell quite a powerful blast of bleach so we did know that the room and linens were clean... though if you have a big sensitivity to that it could be a bigger issue. My father-in-law had the same smell in his room and noticed it on the sheets/pillows when he was sleeping. The pool is interesting, it is quite small but is half inside and half outside. I was able to swim in late March but the pool was a little chilly to be really comfortable. The hot tub is also very small and can't accomodate more than two people unless you are on very friendly terms. We didn't try the hotel restaurant as the prices were higher than other nearby ones outside the hotel. They did have a cheaper cafe but it was similar in price to the Starbucks that was just across the entry. For tourist activities I would suggest the Duck Tour which gives you a nice overview of the city layout. We did it as soon as we arrived and it gave us our bearings quite well. We also did the Argosy harbour tour which was nice since the weather was spectacular, and the underground tour which was very interesting. We ate at Ivar's for dinner just a few blocks stroll down the waterfront and were perfectly happy with it. We ended up sitting in the lounge and ordering off the \"happy hour\" menu (good from 3pm until close) which was about 1/3 of the price of the main menu and the portions were perfectly sufficient for us. We didn't eat at the Crab Pot as the reviews on Tripadvisor weren't very good. Some hints for getting around: - there is apparently a free bus that goes right along the waterfront, we didn't know this until we were leaving - take a taxi or bus to the Space Needle, the walk is uphill and fairly arduous... it is an easy walk back to the hotel though since it is downhill - to go to Pike Place Market, take the parkade elevator just to the right of the hotel (when facing from the waterfront). It saves you a hundred stairs or so and deposits you on the right level - parking is expensive everywhere, at the hotel it will run you $40 per day including taxes. I suggest leaving your car when going out to the tourist attractions since parking will be more than taxis wherever you go. - the monorail doesn't take you anywhere you likely want to go, so unless you just want to go on it for the sake of going... don't bother.", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Girls Getaway!\u201d", "Author": "mcfbar", "ReviewID": "UR101114355", "Content": "We go away every year to celebrate our favorite Irish holiday; St. Patrick's Day.

If there was a business center I could not find it and no signs to indicate otherwise. Charging for internet service in your room? Are you kidding. Staff was friendly and the guys who parked the cars were extremely pleasant and helpful geting us around town. Proximity to the Boarwalk, Pikes Market and wide variety of good resturants in the area was a plus. We were not familiar with the area and were looking for a Concierge but had to rely on the front desk staff for assistance when they were not helping other travelers.

There is a Cost Plus World Market at the top of that hill, which is a good place to buy wine to take onboard the cruise ships. :) Back at the hotel we had a drink downstairs and did some people watching.

The walls were thinner than most hotel walls and we could hear every noise that was made in the surrounding rooms, including every time someone in one of those rooms took a shower, right down to when they opened and closed the shower curtain. The TV was also apparently set to only go to a certain volume, which was very low, resulting in our hearing other people moving around in their rooms over the TV in our own room. Although the waterfront location was nice, we found that it was noisy and crowded outside on the pier because there was a cruise ship in the port both days we stayed there. Overall, the hotel was just average at best but I felt that we paid an above-average price. We even had to pay for the Internet access (whereas at another, lower-priced and significantly nicer Marriott where we stayed during this same trip we did not). If the price had been significantly lower, I would not be complaining.

The hotel was fine; it delivered on all of the Marriott brand promises and, overall, my stay was in line with my expectations. The hotel was expensive, however. For this visit, the convenience of being next to the conference center on a tight itinerary justified the expense, but if I had the flexibility to stay elsewhere, I would. The hotel just did not deliver a better experience than other hotels that are far cheaper and located nearby. That isn't to say it delivered a bad experience -- just not an experience that was in line with how the room rate compared to other properties of a similar service level in the same vicinity. The lobby of the hotel is quite lovely. The rooms, while not problematic, are the \"old\" Marriott rooms -- a bit on the small side, very traditional decor (whereas the Marriott rooms feel modern and updated). Some of the rooms have great views of the water; others do not. Thankfully, the hotel did not put any rooms that have windows next to the train track that runs behind the hotel, and I didn't hear any outside noise in my room. The rest of the hotel facilities (concierge lounge, fitness center, business center, etc.) were very nice and pretty standard for a Marriott. Kudos to the hotel for service -- every person I interacted with was friendly, helpful, and seemed to go above and beyond. In one sense, the hotel's location is great, as it's right on the water. It's also very close (up a staircase or elevator) to Pike Place Market, which is a lot of fun. The hotel isn't far from most of the other major downtown Seattle attractions. However, I think many of the other hotels in Seattle have a BETTER location; they're in the center of the action instead of being down on the water and thus have better access to sights, restaurants, etc. The waterfront gets pretty quiet after 6pm or so, while the portions of the city \"up the hill\" stay alive and feel more vibrant.

So we have a combined business/ pleasure travel perspective. He was satisfied with the meeting rooms. I found it to be in a good location for exploration of the city. The gym was under renovation and the pool was not especially inviting. Location: Pros: The hotel is in an excellent location.It is on the waterfront. Just cross the street and you are at a marina. The street elevator is located right BESIDE the hotel-very handy to go up to Pike Place Market Area. There is a #99 Waterfront/Pioneer Square bus which is free of charge.There is a stop across the street from the hotel entrance. There is a great walking/jogging/biking path that goes right by the front of the hotel.It follows the waterfront all the way down past Miners Landing (It is a wharf with shops, restaurants). Walk a little bit past Miners Landing to Elliott's Restaurant -recomended eating spot. Be aware: It is a bit of an uphill walk to get to the downtown shopping area so I took a taxi to Macy's It was only a$5-8 fare.I walked back to the hotel. It was an easy down hill walk Check-in When we made the reservation. we requested a King bed, high floor, water view . It was a conference rate but we were told it would be noted BUT we had to request this again upon check-in. I fiured that perhaps, we might get one of the requests. We were disappointed that upon arrival the ONLY room available was a 4th floor room with two double beds.There was a partial waterview from inside the room. One had to step out onto the small balcony to improve your view but it is still a partial view due to the design of the building The room: Pros: It had a fresh decor. Carpets were obviously new. There was a comfortable armchair & wheeled deskchair.The desk had a pull-out that doubled as a table The linens were atractive and comfortable. Cons: The room was not overly spacious however it was an adequate size - the furniture seemed a bit of a tight fit for the size of the room. There was a regual sized closet however there were only three drawers in the bureau because in the other half there was was a nice empty mini-frig.There was a big flat - screen t.v. on top . Digital not HD, I think The beds were actually double bed size - much more narrow than Queen beds. Despite being awkwardly narrow, they were remarkably comfortable. A bit of a caution: I cannot see how this room would comfortably accomodate 4 people Housekeepng Service: We received exceptional service from Jin-Jin. She looked after our room for the duration of our 5 day stay. She was helpful in meeting our individual preferences- eg) stocking only decaf coffee. She was obviously assigned to our floor thus she became familiar with all the guests in our section - merrily greeting me and offering to be of assistance. This was a notable plus. Room Service: It was good food and prompt service. It was good value Restaurant: There is an enjoyable restaurant on the main floor. We had excellent service and the delicious food was well presented. I suggest eating here at a window table. We were at a table in a private alcove along the entry hall. It provided a nice view plus privacy. Overall impression: The hotel has been renovated and spruced up so it exceeded my expectations given the reviews on TA. I prefered this location rather than staying in the downtown business area where I have stayed before. The waterfront is a distinct asset. It was good value for the cost.

Besides the aging Edgewater Hotel nearby, there just aren't any hotels right on the water in the Emerald City but this is as close as you can get. We loved this hotel! #544 was a corner/waterfront view. It was pretty darn nice as it was, but judging from the pictures submitted by other reviewers it would have been even better on one of the higher floors. The room was modern, clean, and comfortable. We had a front row view of the ferries coming and going, as well as freighters coming into port and other ships and boats of all types and sizes cruising by. Great view! New LG high def flat screen TV. Plenty of room and lots of hangars in the closet. (That's a first!) The hotel has a wonderfully contemporary lobby with lots of artwork and lots of places to sit. The 2100 Bistro has a good restaurant with a nice bar. 2100 also serves a terrific breakfast and lunch. Everyone on the staff was friendly and hardworking. There is a small, two computer terminal business center. Also, a small pool featured in other review pictures. While I was on a treadmill in the fitness center, it was literally being dismantled by workers who were taking equipment pieces away in preparation for remodeling. But the hotel's GM had put out a note to all guests alerting them of the situation and that the gym would be moving next door temporarily. Nice touch to see hotel execs communicate like that. The employee \"at your service\" lived up to its name. Phone operators pick up the phone and repeat your last name when you call. Again, a nice touch. There are complimentary Wall Street Journals and USA Today newspapers. On site valet parking is expensive as some other reviewers have noted, but you get what you pay for. The ONLY thing I would change is that leaving the hotel by car and trying to turn left (or right) on Alaskan Way is very tricky because there is no stop light going in that direction. There is only a pedestrian walk/don't walk indicator that only counts down the numbers when pedestrians are crossing the street. it seemed very treacherous to inch out into traffic and attempt to turn right or left onto Alaskan Way. It is extremely poorly marked, as are several other driveways along the nearby streets. Not the hotel's fault, but very difficult nonetheless. I'm surprised there aren't a lot of accidents out front! There are several good restaurants nearby. Anthony's is right across the street. Try BlueAcre Seafood downtown....just opened. Owned by the same couple that operates Steelhead Diner in the Pike Place Market. Wonderful food and modern light and airy ambiance. There was ONE slightly confusing element to making reservations here: the Marriott website states very plainly that there are no connecting rooms in any price level. That is not the case but you'd never know that from the website and frankly, a couple of people in the on-site reservation department were clueless about this. Thankfully, an alert and talented front desk supervisor helped me out on the phone and blocked out the room reservations for me. We checked in without a hitch!

At least this is what I had expected when I paid $229 per night. On Sunday I realise the the desk lamp doesn't work. Since I know I will work in the evening I ask the next morning to have it repaired by the evening.

The next evening I come back late at 10pm again. This time my room has not been cleaned. It looks like when I left it in the morning including wet towels on the bathroom floor. I go downstairs and request to talk to the manager and place a formal written complaint. It takes the staff half an hour to clean my room, before I can use it again. As compensation for the last two days, the manager offered me complementary breakfasts for the rest of my stay. I usually don't eat breakfast, but I thought it was at least a gesture. But when I bring my little handwritten note (on a business card) to the breakfast restaurant I really had to work hard for receiving my complementary breakfasts. The staff questioned my note and requested to keep it, but what would I show the next day if they took my note? It was also my only proof in case I would have to show something at check out and the breakfasts had appeared on my bill. Hence, instead of enjoying these breakfasts, I had to expain over and over again. After my second breakfast I had had enough and skipped the rest.

My mom's room was a little closer to the street than ours and she insisted every day that there was an earthquake. I think it was the trolley.

I jokingly said, some waterview. He said it was a waterview if you looked out the window to the right. Ha. It really didn't matter though.

Checked in Sun. PM for a conference Mon-Fri., very tired, was given a room with a balcony on my request - very nice! On the other hand, the staff misinformed me as to the location of the nearest Walgreen's - the only place, apart from the enormously overpriced and under-provisioned convenience kiosk in the lobby, where you can get some snacks and very basic foods e.g. breakfast, lunch, to stock the in-room refrig - which was definitely a nice feature. Tried to order room service after 9:00 PM (being from NY, I was already up much later than planned) and was told it would be 45 minutes, which I thought was ridiculous, so I canceled my order! I was told the pool was out of service and it remained so for at least the first two days of my stay. On the other hand, the front desk staff were very helpful in directing me to the Seattle Athletic Club, with which they had guest arrangements, for a specially priced visitor pass. (I didn't use the hotel gym, but it appeared - barely - adequate for a cardio-plus-weights exercise regimen for someone traveling and in need of quickly accessible on-site facilities.) Housekeeping were kind enough to give extra towels - but there are no towel bars to hang them! (One hook on the bathroom door and a small bar in the tub - where the shower would get anything hung on it soaking wet - a ridiculous design flaw, to say the least....) On Thursday, I left specific instructions on the door hang tag (as per the hotel guidelines!) for my room to be cleaned by 1:00 PM as the conference would be concluded by then - my room was NEVER cleaned that day! I returned to a dirty room at 2:00, went out for a couple of hours, by 4:00 it was still dirty. Oh - and I tried room service again that evening, and this time they told me it would be at least an HOUR! I told them about my experience Sunday and that they had the slowest room service I'd ever experienced anywhere - and again I canceled my order. (Hate to think how slow the service is in the restaurant!) Two phones in the room, but the one cordless on the desk never worked - why'd they even bother? A monster-sized 42\" or 45\" LCD TV that seemed to take a year to power up (just like our old tube-type black-and-white Zenith when I was a kid - how nostalgic!). The alarm clock didn't work, I discovered the second day (thankfully the night before I needed it - I woke up on my own that morning and it had never gone off to my recollection, so I tested it - and it failed.) The front desk people had a working one sent to me immediately. A combination alarm clock/radio/CD player with 2 alarms and VERY arcane, hard-to-work controls - bring your own travel alarm with you! I selected this hotel as it was pre-arranged by the conference sponsors, featured a conference-advantaged price, and was located across the street from the conference hall. Any of the rates for this hotel I've otherwise come across on travel sites have been much higher and would be clearly unjustifiable based on my experience. While the front desk staff was most kind and courteous and as helpful as they could be under the circumstances, I'm left with the impression that most of the rest of the staff just do not care about their customers.

Online I had booked a room that was supposed to be facing the water and it cost more than the \"regular\" rate. When we arrived at our room it was facing the elevator/stairs that lead to town. I was not happy! I called and let them know I had booked a room facing the water. They aplogized and asked me to come to the desk to update to a new room. The next room we go to, once again, was NOT facing the water but had a balcony. I was very upset but had to get going to attend the baseball game. I figured I would give up the room with a view and hassle for the regular rate instead at check out. On a note about complaints about a ship being in the way, the only thing I can think of is that perhaps the cruise ships We received the bill under the door and not surprisingly, they charged us the higher rate. We went to the desk and barely had to argue our side of the story. She quickly apologized and gave us an OUTSTANDING lower rate. A rate that was no where to be found online. For that, I give them kudos for fixing their mistake. So if you are booking online and request a room facing the water, be sure to request that upon check in, do not assume you will get it. Other than that, the lobby was simple, yet beautiful. The lobby music was a trendy/ electronica type music that was played too loud for even my 30 year old ears. The rooms were remarkably clean and the TV was great. My complaint about the tv channel selection is there is no Weather Channel and no Fox Sports Network. The bathrooms were spacious and the hot water was immediate and lasted. The room itself was a little more plain than I had expected but comfortable. I was able to pick up wifi on my iPod Touch at times and that was convenient. We only ate one time at the hotel restaurant and that was for breakfast. I ordered the Challah French Toast and it was the best dish I have ever encountered. I'm not usually a consumer of such sweets but was feeling indulgent. It was heaven on a plate! If you have a car with you, be aware that the overnight parking fee is around $35 but well worth it. The valet folk are super friendly and your vehicle is easily accesible. Very much worth the price.

It's a popular stop for tourists transiting the cruise ship terminal across the street as well as business travelers seeking a bit of luxury in a great location. Both colorful Pike Street Market and eclectic Belltown are minutes away by foot. Although I have paid full-freight, the Waterfront Marriott becomes a stupendous value at discounted rates. Check for specials. I recently arrived on a chilly February afternoon, but the Marriott hospitality would soon warm me up. The hotel lobby exudes Seattle charm with generous glass sculptures, dreamy trance and jazz, and well-accented furnishings with outstanding lightning. The valet parking staff and bellmen are universally friendly and efficient. Within a day, they knew my name and helped with a special request. The front desk staff were very accommodating, even indulging me while I snapped photos inside one evening. Room furnishings are quite comfortable with luxurious bedding, although I never have cared much for most Marriott computer work areas. You probably know what I mean. The chair and desk arrangements are often uncomfortable. From the 8th floor, I had a nice view of the container ship Kauai docked at the cruise ship terminal. (Others have noted the same, but I have no surprise at seeing a docked ship in a working port.) I could also watch the passenger ferries cross the sound's waters and discharge near the end of Madison Street. The lobby bar is an excellent place to relax or to meet with friends before a night on the town. Bartenders Chris and Cody can banter with the best and bring a smile to a weary traveler, even if just with a great drink. Food-wise, previous travelers may remember Todd English and should know he and Marriott parted ways at the New Year. His Fish Club restaurant no longer occupies one corner of the building. While the restaurant host told me they serve Sunday brunch in the former FIsh Club, most of the dining is done in the side lobby on the street side of the bar. The setting is a bit dark and dreary. The host -- who may have been the manager -- was hardly forthcoming when I asked questions and was the sole staff member who failed to impress me. The waitress, on the other hand, was friendly and attentive, and she answered all my questions about the food and the operations. It seems the dining area will be re-done in the coming months. Grumpy host and darkness aside, the food was simply outstanding, the center of which was a perfectly medium-rare 16 oz NY steak with baby asparagus and rich, creamy potatoes. WIne selections are reasonably priced for a hotel with a wide variety of quality labels. I enjoyed breakfast in the concierge lounge, which has a limited but adequate range, and evening snacks were pretty good. One night I had a Reuben at the bar, and it delivered on satisfying my hunger. You have a million dining options in Seattle, too. Anthony's Pier 66 is across the street, nearby Ivar's, and many flavors of Belltown are a few blocks away. While taxi fares are not inexpensive in Seattle, no place in the downtown district or China Town is very far. Even the baseball and football stadiums are accessible by a long walk or a short cab ride. Swing by for some dim sum before or after a the big game. If you're driving, you can self-park or take advantage of the valet parking ($34/day). For business travelers with meetings in the downtown area, staying here is a no-brainer if on a discounted rate.

I had expected more of the waterfront area. Of course it was winter and rather grey and gloomy as one would expect for Seattle at this time of year, but the waterfront (in case you don't know) is very industrial with big freight ships and a railway track nearby. To be fair I had not done my research, as we were staying such a short time to catch a flight back to London, but I don't think I would be in a rush to return. The hotel has adequate room service and the staff do seem willing to please. There is quite a nice (small) pool area which goes outside, so is part in and part out, which the kids liked. The bar menu is very limited, but they are willing to serve options from the fish restaurant attached to the hotel in the bar. At 3p.m. it was not possible to obtain bar or restaurant service, and we were referred to room service (but we had already checked out, and to be honest wanted a meal in a bar/restaurant,) but as a special request, the fish restaurant would serve us a late lunch (they did not open for dinner until 4p.m.), this was a rather nice touch and the staff were friendly and helpful. Our fellow travellers had difficulties with a less than perfectly clean room, but ours was fine, very clean and the Marriott bed was as usual lovely. At the time we stayed in early January, the area felt a little deserted, but may have more atmosphere at other times of the year. It reminded us of a rather jaded English seaside resort, but with more of a big city edge. Limited experience with the locals, and the mounted police (the kids wanted to stroke the horse) was very positive. There is a handy lift from the waterfront area up to Pike Place (the market) if you turn left out of the hotel past the fish restaurant you should find it on the left.

To be fair, the location of this hotel is fantastic and the staff was friendly. Unfortunately though, that's where it ends. We were paying close to $300 a night for our room and did not feel like it was worth it at all. Here are my specific complaints: 1. Our confirmation said we would have a \"spectacular view of Elliott Bay.\" We were able to see the bay, I'll give them that. Spectacular would be overstating it, though. If we stood in one of the corners of the room right up against the window and looked off to the side, we could see the water over top of a couple of parking garages. Spectacular? Not really. This alone would not have been enough to make me complain though since we don't really spend a lot of time in our room. 2. The bed was not comfortable AT ALL. I usually like Marriott beds and think they're very comfy. This one was awful. I read another review saying they felt like they were bouncing around all night any time their spouse moved. Yup, I'll agree with that. I don't really have back problems, but by the end of our 3-night stay my back was killing me and I really hadn't slept well because of all the bouncing around. 3. The third morning of my trip, the shower was ice cold. This was the last straw for me. $300 a night for a cold shower? Really??? At this point I filled out a comment card for the manager. I would have called and talked to someone directly but we were in a hurry to get on the road and my husband didn't want me to take the time. I was very specific on the comment card and left all my contact info hoping for something in response, and I have heard absolutely nothing in response to my complaints which makes me cranky. I may still call although I don't know what I would expect to happen at this point. To sum up, the location was really great and for that reason I could give it 2 stars instead of 1. Otherwise I felt like it was a total rip. One more tip: I wouldn't really advise paying a lot of extra money for the concierge level unless you get a good deal and it's not too much more than a regular room. You get free breakfast which is always nice, but it's basically bread stuff (cereal, muffins, etc) and scrambled eggs and bacon. It's the same thing every morning. They have free muchies in the afternoon and you can buy drinks, but the drinks are just as overpriced as they would be in a bar. So it was nice enough and all, but not worth a whole lot of extra money. . \\", "Date": "September 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntington, New York", "Title": "\u201cMarriott's a lifesaver.\u201d", "Author": "toodycat", "ReviewID": "UR8656285", "Content": "We were booked at the Fairmont in Seattle for one night before an Alaskan cruise.

This is not technically correct as the hotel is actuially E-shaped, so the chances of getting a room with a view of your neighbor is double!

I received a south-facing room on the seventh floor with a lovely balcony which afforded terrific views to the right of the water.

I stayed on the concierge floor and can report that the lounge is decently equipped with all-day fruit, soft drinks, coffee and bottled water. Food presentations were unimpressive but tasty. The lounge itself seemed a bit small for the property, easily filled to capacity with guests (and this was a weekend). I saw many guests taking food back to their rooms because of the lack of seating. The lounge staff was intermittantly available but in general courteous and helpful. Some staff seemed less-than-well-versed in local restaurants and/or food quality as I was sent to place \"with the best prime rib\" that proved to be just about awful. The downstairs concierge seemed more knowlegeable albeit much busier. The hotel restaurant was very good. Staff were knowlegeable, wine selections thoughtful and food very good to excellent. Seems many locals come to enjoy the food and outdoor bar/patio. The waterfront location afforded spectacular views of the Sound and easy access to the cruise, ferry and tourist boat terminals. Also at hand are many trinket stores as well as many seafood restaurants (of which Elliot's is very good). Access to the main town is either via steps or elevators. And then you walk under a highway viaduct (strewn with garbage) and uphill a couple more blocks.

When the maid cleaned the room she removed it from the door knob and placed it on the desk in the room. Needless to say, we didn't realize she put it on the desk, so we didn't get breakfast the next morning. How hard could it have been to have left it there? The next night, I put it out at around 11:00pm, and it was still there the next morning. They didn't bother to pick it up. Why offer a service, that you have no intention of providing. I would have thought this was an isolated incident, but a couple of weeks later friends of ours stayed here with the same company, and the same thing happened to them. They actually wanted breakfast delivered 3 days. After the first 2 request were not picked up, they complained to the front desk and at the same time ordered their breakfast for the next morning. When their breakfast was delivered, there were 3 days worth of breakfasts. When they checked out, the front desk tried to charge them for the entire 3 days worth of breakfasts.

I loved the location of this hotel because it was right on the waterfront and was so close in walking distance to some nice sights/attractions. Mainly, I adore Pike Place Market, and this hotel allowed me to walk to & from there easily. We also loved the bedding used in the rooms. We did have an unpleasant experience at the get-go when we tried to check in - the clerk speaking with us said the system only showed us as having a reservation for one night, instead of 4 nights! This was a little annoying, but we figured it would be easily solved, so it was more the clerk's attitude that ended up escalating the situation and making us angry. She just kept insisting that whatever the computer said must be right, and did a poor job of handling the situation. It wasn't until the manager, who was standing nearby, came over that the problem was fixed, and then she was able to fix it quickly, and see our enire 4 night reservation. So it was unfortunate that our first impression as we checked into the hotel served to thoroughly anger my husband due to one clerk's attitude/incompetence. Some other semi-negative notes: I only saw a concierge at the desk once during our entire stay, the ATM machine in the hotel charges a fee of $3.25, and the laundry prices are outrageous. There are fortunately free washer & dryer available in the hotel, but be warned that the laundry room consists of 2 small washers and 2 small dryers, so you may have to wait awhile behind others, as I did. The only fee though is $1.00 for a box of detergent or dryer sheets. I wish our room had had a little better view (peek of water in the corner, otherwise view of other buildings & train), but overall I was pleased with this hotel experience. With the exception of the first clerk we encountered, most of the other staff we interacted with were helpful, and I thought the lobby entrance to the hotel, with the sparkling lights in the ceiling, were very pretty.

A great place to base yourselves for a family vacation (we were very happy with the deal we received booking a package through the marriott.com web site -- airfare, hotel and car rental.)

The waterfront view from our room (652) was very nice, and the small balcony was a plus. You are in easy walking distance to Pike Place Market and some wonderful restaurants in the Belltown neighborhood. A great find was La Bella e Vita on 2nd Avenue between Battery and Wall. Or just walk across the street to Pier 66 (we'd recommend you stick to the first floor, which they call the Bell Street Diner. An excellent menu, very fresh fish nicely prepared and if you like micro-brew beer, try the Manny's on tap. You can't get it in a bottle so enjoy it while you can. For breakfast, the Fish Club in the hotel offers a great buffet for a reasonable $14.95 per adult ($7.50 for children) or order off the menu (check out the French Toast). But most days we just walked up the adjacent stairway to the Pike Place Market and dropped into the Le Panier French bakery. There is also a great little donut spot at the south end of the market -- about $2 for a half dozen mini-donuts that you just watched them make. One caution: If you are staying for more than a couple nights and have a car, you might want to park it for $12 a day in the Art Institute parking garage to the north of the hotel. Turn right out of the hotel, go up a block to Wall, turn right on Wall, turn right at the next light and head up about a block to the garage's upper entrance.

The mistake they made resulted with my young child sleeping with my wife, my teenager sleeping on the king and me sleeping on a pullout. It was extremely uncomfortable. Then when we had breakfast I found hair in my eggs. It was very unhygenic! I was discusted. From then on we ate out. I recommend this hotel if you're only staying for a couple days.", "Date": "June 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay!!\u201d", "Author": "MinnyTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR3544882", "Content": "I really enjoyed my stay at the Seattle Waterfront Marriott. The location is great, right along the water and very close to the market. I enjoyed taking walks/runs along the waterfront. The hotel itself is very pleasent and is nicely decorated. An added bonus is that the hotel has a business center where you can use their computers with unlimited completely free access to the internet. What a nice amenity to have when traveling!
