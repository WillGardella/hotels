Home made breakfast was tasty and service was excellent in cramped dinner room - Breakfast was only acceptable part of visiting. The rooms have not toilet. Shared toilet in corridor was not as big where a normal sized man could sit and thing - when you have number 2 thing, you had to keep the door open - not very nice. Do not imagine hairy legs etc... There is a tiny portable shower in the room, dusty air, mouses, smell etc.... huh - never again.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cProbably my worst hotel experience ever.\u201d", "Author": "tony h", "ReviewID": "UR124607809", "Content": "The room was dirty and very small. The sheets on the bed had hair on them from some previous guest. The shower was blocked and the water presure very low. There was an old fridge in the room and not realizing that it was not switched on I opened the door: there was rotting food inside and the smell was terrible. The window did not shut properly so the road noise from outside kept me awake. They had no other rooms and I had arrived too late in the evening to find anywhere else.

I had read that some persons were cheated, but that surely would not happen to us, we are nice people =) But of course that was exactly what happened. At first they tried to give us a room whithout toilet and shower. Then we showed them our copy of the booking. In the end we got a VERY small room with one bed. The sheets were less broad than the bed, so we slept on the mattress itself. But the room was very clean! After two nights we were moved to a room with 2 beds. This room was the most filthy you can imagine. Never cleaned. I got so much allergy, so I had to SIT all night because of coughing. The breakfast was very good! But we have never ever had so bad service. We were totally deceived!", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cpoor hotel\u201d", "Author": "peterA725", "ReviewID": "UR118497533", "Content": "Very nice reception Very nice breakfast room thats where it ends.

The room was so small that we couldn't open our luggages! No chairs, no angers, no AC or fan. We booked a twin bed but there was only a single bed a little bit larger! Absolutely not a silent place: we couldn't sleep well because the stairs and the doors of the rooms was very old and too noisy. The environment is not quiet at all because there is a pub thereabout. When we complained about the room, the owner gave us another accomodation in the next building at the 5th floor! This second room was a mansard, larger and with shower but the windows was too small and there was a lot of hot. The bathroom was three floors downstairs! We had the same problem with noise during all week. The breakfast was very poor and the first day we had to wait 20 minutes to take it because the breakfast room was too small. So, the hotel's standard is very low and doesn't worth the price we paid!
