Definitely wanna pack those Bose headsets for this one. There's a party down below most every night. (Felt like the Cancun of Paris...Lots of college kids and drinking (and singing) crowds!) Ok if prepared for it, as the price is fair. But do not go without earplugs or headset if you wish to sleep~ Only other downside is this: They give you one key per room; it has an electronic fob to get you INTO the building at night AND locks your room door (with regular key) both from inside and out. (I.e. no other option to lock yourself IN, but with the key....which means, if one person leaves to go out for a bit, the other has the option of a) going out at the same time and staying out the exact same time; b) staying IN in an unlocked room; or c) being locked IN the room until the other returns with the key. Not only could this be a fire hazard, it was just hard to plan around, as the key is on a rather large fob and not easily hidden if that's your plan for sharing it. Hope this helps.

It is not a conventional hotel insofar as there is no reception desk or restaurant, it is more of a collection of self contained apartments in a beauitiful little building.

You do have to call to let them know when you are arriving but we did this when we arrived in Paris and were about 15 minutes away and it was no problem.

So that's a minus--you have to check in when they tell you and it is not a moment before 10 am and probably not after 4:30 pm. There is NO ONE on the premises. I have no idea where the buzzer goes to or where the person who lets you in stays normally. The lift is like a half of a coffin--can hardly accommodate you and your rollie bag. There is no glass in the bathroom or anywhere else, even though I had a microwave and a mini-fridge. I called to ask , \"are there any plates or silver I could use?\" \"No! You did not book a kitchen!\" \"Why is there a fridge and microwave here?\" \" You have them, but you did not book them\" \"Could I have a glass to rinse my mouth out after brushing my teeth?\" \"SIGH...!\" Later a woman did bring me two coffee cups. \"Could I have an extra blanket? It's very cold\" (-2C outside). \"No extra blankets. You have a heater\". No internet. PLUSES: It's incredibly cheap for Paris. The bed was heavenly- solid foam. The pillows and linens were wonderful. The room (21) was completely quiet and i slept soundly--it was really too cold for people to be on the streets at night. The bathroom was new and pristine. The towels were great. The water was scalding. There was a tub and shower. It is in a lovely area. The key pad works better than most places that have codes. I didn't see anyone else.

The only thing wrong with this place is the noise level at night. Otherwise, it's really a fantastic deal. The property consists of about 10 rooms that are all situated off a narrow spiral staircase. A tiny 2-person elevator is available for those who don't like the spiral staircase. The rooms either face the street directly, or are off to the side a bit. It's well-situated, sitting just behind Saint Sulpice Church. There's a bakery down the street, small restaurants and cafes across the street, great designer shopping in the area, and 2 metro stops just 3 minutes away. It takes about 7 minutes to walk to the Seine. We stayed in a mini-apartment on the fourth floor that consisted of a small ante-room, a small bathroom, and a bedroom that had a mini-kitchen with sink, fridge, small cooktop, and table and chairs. The apartment came with dishes and silverware, an ironing board, daily housekeeping, flat panel TV, a phone, and some information on the area. Hot water was plentiful, water pressure was great, we were able to control the room temperature via the electrical heaters, and the place was very clean. The bathroom was very well lit and had modern fixtures. All in all, it was more than adequate, especially for 45 Euros per night (we got a killer deal through Travelocity). The only problem -- and a big problem at that -- was the noise level at night. Our apartment faced the street and the single-pane windows weren't thick enough to block the noise coming from below. The bars across the street cater to a younger crowd that likes to party and we heard a lot of drunken yelling until 4:00 a.m. every morning. That, coupled with the echoing cavernlike effect of every sound bouncing off the buildings made everything much louder than you'd expect. Even the sound of women walking in high-heeled boots was amplified. The sound of someone sneezing on the street was louder than a flush from the toilet upstairs.
