They did send a plumber to fix it but really this is not what you would expect from a Hilton establishment.

Large safe in room to hold just about anything. They serve a hot breakfast not just continental. Sure you may get bored with it but you can cook yourself or walk right outside to Denny's or other restaurant. They do change it up every other day or so and try to keep everything topped up. Line-ups and seating is the only real issue at meal time. You can't beat waking up, grabbing breakfast and heading to WDW or Seaworld. Saves time and money. My son is a picky eater to boot so grabbing tiny bits of food at the breakfast bar for him to try is priceless really. We made it back for complimentary \"snack\" one afternoon - it was chicken stir fry. It was salty but probably a good thing since we were sweating all day.

When we booked it we had the impression that it would be a no-frills hotel in a convenient location.

You are within walking distance of so many good places to eat (Bahamas Breeze, Millers etc.), there are bus stops almost directly outside, you can rent a car across the road, cheap helicopter tours nearby and free shuttles to Orlando and Disney. There is also a Walgreens less than 5 minutes away. When we arrived we were given such a warm reception by the staff at the front desk (Nancy & Luis I think). It was that greeting (and the bottle of complimentary wine) that set the tone for the rest of our stay. The room was large, clean and comfortable. You get plenty of living area, two HDTVs, a large fridge, 2 hobs and a microwave. One thing that isn't mentioned is the \"Manager's Reception\" which is essentially free Dinner most nights. It is perfect if you're feeling a bit peckish and it consists of good and honest food. The complimentary breakfast was great too. There were laundry facilities on our floor too, handy for getting your clothes clean before the next part of your adventure.

We stayed here as a family while my husband was in Orlando for business. We chose a suite so we would have room to move and a Kitchen so I could fix food for my boys that have food allergies Upon arrival, they told us to park at a certain door which was very far from the room and we eventually found the back side door the next day to be closer (but that is where the employees sit and smoke so you had to walk by smoke with kids every time we went in and out of the hotel- they also kept this door unlocked for anyone to walk in) Con: We walked into our \"non-smoking\" room to be greeted with an overwhelming smell of smoke, with asthma and a kid who gets sick from smoke (we stayed out of the room as much as possible which is not what we planned because of the smoke smell). So, I walked in further to see a tiny fridge with no freezer and the bottom piece missing which my curious one year old quickly found was missing. The trim on the kitchen floor was all chewed up, so obviously a dog was previously in our room and my one year old once again found it and almost got cut on it. Con: The beds were very hard to me and I didn't sleep well but my husband slept fine, he thought they were a little hard but not bad. Con: The rooms and beds were sorta clean, we found a purple sock and magazines shoved down in the couch cushions so obviously they didn't clean there and there were crumbs in the drawers so we just lived out of our suitcase for the week. Con: They offer Free High Speed Internet which is basically a joke because we could only get service in about 2 spots in the entire suite and it ran S L O W. Hoping it would be faster at the business center...LOL that is a joke of a business center. I can't remember the last time I saw computers that old and that useless, i finally got it to load and get to the page i needed to print only to get an error that it couldn't print so I had to find a local library and pay $5 to use their computers and print one piece of paper. As we were packing up, I put the dirty dishes in the dishwasher to get cleaned and it was soo loud and making noises that when I looked at it when it was done, the dishwasher actually came/shook itself out of the wall. Con: No full size fridge as advertised and pictured on their website. Con: High Speed Internet is a joke. Con: Room smelled horrible of smoke Con: The breakfast buffet- eggs were ugghh and the sausage was fake meat and I am not even that picky on food.

THE GOOD STUFF: We stayed in a King Suite which offered a kitchenette, two t.v.s in separate rooms and a VERY comfortable bed. There is an in-room safe, and the bathroom offers a lot of space (sink is separate from toilet/bathtub). I was very happy with the full-sized fridge because we were freezing water bottles to take with us to the parks. There was no \"stove\" - it was more of a hot plate, but we purchased a lot of 'easy' frozen meals that just needed to be heated up so it did the job. There is a manager's reception from Monday to Friday (Fridays are the best days) that offers an evening snack and 'free' alcohol (a few select beers and wine), as well as breakfast with a LOT to choose from. On certain floors there's a small laundry room that only takes quarters. You can purchase everything you need in the gift shop next to reception, and get quarters as well. We slept very well in this room and never heard noise from the neighbouring rooms or the hallway. Parking was NEVER an issue. THE BAD STUFF: When we checked in, \"something happened\" with our reservation (booked 4 months in advance) and we were put into a smoking room because there were no more King Suites available for our stay. If we insisted on non-smoking (which we are), we would end up with something smaller and wouldn't be able to get a refund because we didn't pay through the hotel itself. A few days it seemed like the room wasn't even made-up, the towels were refreshed but they didn't make the bed or give us fresh toilet paper/bags when we changed our own garbage. We never complained to the front desk, but the next day everything would be done.

When we left for dinner we requested that the room be cleaned - when we returned the beds were made but to say it was cleaned was a stretch. The next day I left a tip and we had a room that was actually cleaned and we had extra towels. Lesson learned - tip if you want your room cleaned. The second annoyance was the Hilton's preferred car service. The black sedans are always out front and the staff even had the nerve to say we should wait inside for their cab because other companies will rip you off. Their company is the one doing the ripping off. All numbers are before tip - i) Airport to hotel with 3rd party cab $36 - hotel to airport with Hilton's service $42, ii) SeaWorld $14 with Hilton's recommended service - return with a regular cab was $7.70 one time and $9.35 on our visit from Discovery Cove, iii) Universal $14, return with a regular cab $10.05. We also went to Animal Kingdom and we had a driver named George - he was terrible. In addition to not paying attention while driving, he overcharged us ($45 there, $36 back with a regular cab) while he ironically told us what a rip off Disney was - don't bite the hand that feeds you - especially when you have two young customers in the back making their first trip to Disney.

The waffles were very popular with the children staying at the hotel! There is fruit juice, tea, coffee and hot chocolate at breakfast and there is also free tea and coffee available 24 hours a day. The hotel suites are cleaned daily and every evening we would come back to our room to find our kids' teddies all neatly lined up on the bed, the kids loved this, we thought it was pretty cool too! We had a one bedroom suite with a sofa bed in the living room which was perfectly adequate for our boys (they never complained that they were uncomfortable), they were so tired from the parks that they just got into the bed and went straight to sleep (they very rarely do this at home)! The suites are fully equipped with a toaster, hairdryer, coffee maker, microwave, dishwasher and large fridge freezer, you may need to take a kettle if you think you would need one (we took a kettle but didnt use it as there was always tea, coffee and hot water available). We didnt get a chance to sample any of the manager's free evening meals which are served Monday to Thursday 5pm-7pm as we never returned to the hotel early enough. The location of this hotel is perfect, in a very nice spot just off International Drive, at the Seaworld end. It is in a very quiet position which is nice after all the mayhem of the parks etc! There are various shops and restaurants within walking distance, there is also a Walgreens store approximately a five minute walk away from the hotel. We only used the pool and spa a few times but it was very good, the hotel supplies towels to dry off with and although the pool doesn't get much sun at all, this was not a problem for us, as it was still warm. There is a laundry on the 5th floor which we used twice, you can purchase soap powder from the hotel shop for $1.60 or just take some with you. It is 2 dollars (8 x 1 quarter coins) to use the washers and the same for the dryers. These machines cleaned our clothes perfectly well. To sum up, this hotel was perfect for my family's needs and excellent value for money with superb staff. When we checked out, our 8 year old son was in tears as we were leaving. Angelica, one of the lovely receptionists, gave him a gift (the Homewood Suites Rubber Duck Family) which was a lovely gesture. We are already planning our next holiday to Orlando and would only stay in this hotel on International Drive, we cannot rate it highly enough.

It was reasonably priced and close to the convention center. It is also close to lots of food and shops as well as Universal Studios. Disney and Sea World are not too far of a drive. Being half way between the sirport and Disney make it an ideal location. The hotel itself is nice. The lobby has a very nice dining area where they serve a hot breakfast each morning and offer a happy hour each evening with drinks and a few light snacks. There is a Univeral Studios counter where you can get all the park information, tickets, and catch the bus to the park. There is only 1 elevator that goes up the right side of the building. This made getting up and down frustrating b/c it could take forever to catch the elevator, and if it was full, you either woulf have to wait or take the stairs. I chose to take the stairs any time I wasn't carrying luggage. The pool looked nice. However, I did not get the time to actually use it. Parking was free. So if you plan on hitting all the parks, I would just rent a car. A tax ride round trip to the airport or to Disney will run around $100. We were able to get a basic, no thrills rental car for $86 for the week when we got down there. The room was fine for what we paid for. It had a small kitchen and living area with a eat in table for 4 people. The master bedroom was very large with a king bed. The bathroom was your standard hotel bathroom. I had agreed to sleep on the sofa bed and gave my coworker the bed. However, after pulling out the sofa bed, I opted to share the king bed with her. The sofa bed had a very small mattress the was dirty. I could not, even after putting fresh sheets on, bring myself to sleep in it. It ended up not being a huge issue since a king bed was more than enough room for 2 people. But for a family of 3 or more who plan on using the sofa bed, this might be an issue.

The location is great, near the more up market North end of Idrive, its 2 minutes from a 24 hour Walgreens and wonderworks and only a further 5 minutes to the Pointe Orlando complex.

Helicopter tours are next to Dave and Busters, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a must do! The staff are all really friendly and can't do enough for you. The hotel and rooms are a little dated, but compared to other hotels the rooms are so spacious, and it is such a bonus to have a kitchen and lounge area. The only thing we can criticise is the lack of an oven which we would have found extremely useful. The maids were in every day without fail, we felt the hotel in general was very clean. The food wasn't to our taste and there wasn't much choice. That said, the 'welcome home' meals on Mon-Fri were free, so you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complain! There was also no resort fee to pay as I have heard with some other hotels on the Idrive which was another bonus. The only thing that really disappointed us about the hotel was the times for the Disney shuttle bus to the parks. The main reason we booked this hotel was because it offered shuttles to both universal and Disney - which was great as most hotels only offer either. The Disney bus left at either 8am or 10.30am (which was good) but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pick up from Epcot until 9.45pm or 10.30pm which we thought was just too long a day (unless you want to see the fireworks one night).

DO NOT use the Iride trolley, it takes forever and you are packed in like sardines!!

Parking at the hotel is complimentary and ample while parking at Disney is $14.00 a day. The shuttle to Epcot left promptly at 8:00 am each morning and only stopped at the Residence Inn across I-Drive before heading directly to Disney. A later shuttle to Epcot left at 10:00 am daily. Return shuttles left from Epcot at 9:45 pm and 10:30 pm so there is plenty of time to take in the fireworks at Epcot or Fantasmic at Hollywood Studios. For those who want to get back earlier, Lynx buses leave from Downtown Disney and the Disney transportation center. A Lynx schedule is available at www.golynx.com. I found the hotel to be very clean and welcoming. My room was on the fifth floor facing the pool. Noise was not an issue; however, at one point, one of the two elevators was out of order, so the wait on the fifth floor was a little long. As an alternative, I took the stairs down to breakfast and rode the elevator back up to my room thus eliminating the wait. Stairwells were clean and well lit. The bed was very comfortable; but, the hide-a-bed in the living room did not appear to be a comfortable place to sleep. The air conditioning worked well and there was a ceiling fan in my bedroom. The complimentary WiFi was easy to log onto and worked great. I went to breakfast each morning at 7:00 am and at that time I never found it to be crowded. There were eggs and sausage available every morning; however, on a couple of days waffles were not available. There were bagels, cold cereal, fruit, and a choice between oatmeal or grits every day. On a couple of days, bisquits and gravy were available and on the other days potatoes were offered. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance and the night life on I-Drive is great. I found this to be a distinct advantage to staying at a Disney property. There is a Subway close by which I appreciated after returning late from the parks. There is also a Walgreen's within a couple of blocks which is open late and sells very reasonably priced beer and wine. So not to worry if you miss the evening reception at the hotel and don't feel like going out for a beer after a long day at the parks. You can have pizza delivered to your room.

The location itself is perfect, located quite close to universal studios, and wet n'wild water park (which was my kids favourite water park, they weren't gone on the other water park (aquatica) at all for some reason. This hotel had free transport each day to all the universal studios parks, (they had an actual seperate universal desk opposite reception!) which was very well run, I had bought my theme park tickets before I went, after extensive research I went for the flex ticket, as this gave 14 days unlimited access to five different theme parks, Islands of Adventure, Universal Studios, sea world, wet n' wild, Aquatica, and it worked out at $ 1029.81 (www.undercovertourist.com) Approx \u00e2\u201a\u00ac750 (approx 188 per person, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13.50 each per day!) and I got actual proper tickets, not vouchers, which I wouldn't have trusted at all, anyway having the tickets prepaid and with me when I arrived was brilliant, and it was one less expense whilst there too, the hotel also provided free transport to Disney, which you booked a day ahead through reception itself, the only downside I found was that whilst the free transfers to the various parks was brilliant, their return times were way too early, something like 5 p.m., there was no way my guys were ready to leave the parks at that time, so I came around that by buying a ihop pass for the two weeks, which I purchased at the walgreen store alongside the hotel, and it was very cheap, I think about 15 dollars or something like that, and that covered us in the evenings to get back and the ihop stops everywhere on international drive, so it was handy the days we went shopping as well, and you only pay for adults, not children. Back to the hotel, I booked through an internet site rather than directly with the hotel itself, as their rates were ridiculously expensive I thought, compared to the internet site I used, and I booked a one bedroom suite, and asked that two double beds be in the room, instead of the king size, and there was a double couch bed in the sitting room, which my 14 year old son slept on and he had no problems with it, said it was fine and comfortable. The kitchen/living area was spotlessly clean and well organised, I felt it was a bit small on space, but thats probably because I am used to a 3 bedroom house usually on holidays, and suddenly finding us all in the one hotel room was a bit of a squash, but the room itself was lovely, there was a full size fridge, a cooker, a kettle/coffee maker, the bathroom was lovely and spacious, with the shower inside the bath, plenty of towels and lovely neutrogena shampoo/conditioners/soaps etc., and the bedroom had lots of storage space, there was a chest of drawers both in the living room and the bedroom, and the wardrobe was a normal hotel size, we were able to comfortably unpack all our belongings without a problem. The hotel provided breakfast, which was a self-service effort, and there was always loads of food, it got a bit crowded the later in the day you came down, but hey the hotel was busy, we never had a problem getting a table and there was always loads of fresh food on offer, various cereals, every morning they had scrambled egg, which to be honest gets a bit monotonous after 17 days! they also had some kind of cubed potato thing, which maybe the americans favour, but we weren't gone on it, and they had burger type sausages, again I think an american thing, they had fabulous bagels and sourdough bread things, which were gorgeous toasted, and my kids absolutely loved the idea of making your own waffles for breakfast, they became dab hands at it by the end of the first week! the toppings for same were mad though, syrup and chocolate, and various sprinkles etc., really unhealthy, but what can you say when the kids are on holidays! also the drinks machine was open at half eight in the morning, which I thought was crazy, as I noticed my 14 year old with a strofoam cup and cover on it, and I thought it a bit strange, as he doesn't drink tea or coffee, and when I investigated further it turned out it was full of coca cola at half eight in the morning, and the idea of the lid on it was to fool me into thinking he had taken up tea! anyway I banned my lads from any fizzy stuff in the morning, and they were quietly loaded towards the fruit juice machine every other morning, again it was on tap, orange or apple juice, some kind of pink lemonade juice, which was full of sugar (which the kids of course loved), there were yogurts, fresh fruits, various jams, maple syrups, you name it and I think it was in that breakfast room. Strangely enough the hotel use only styrofoam cups and plates and plastic knifes and forks which you just throw away afterwards, I suppose it spares them on the washing up, and it wasn't a problem. All in all I found this hotel to be lovely, the staff were always pleasant and extremely helpful, and never minded being asked various questions, and we had one night where the air conditioning stopped working in our room, which turned out was caused by me, as I pushed the leather armchair back up against the unit, which in turn caused it to freeze up and stop working, anyway when I reported it to reception, the night manager came up straight away and checked the room and agreed it was way too hot to be able to sleep in, and moved us next door immediately, which was brilliant, as that room was lovely and cool, and we were left the use of the two rooms for the following day in order to move our stuff, as there was a problem in fixing in the air-conditioning unit. There is also a laundry in the hotel, which I used twice, and found brilliant, very cheap, a couple of dollars, and you can wash and dry all your clothes, I just put mine on (and because the machines are american, they are of course huge machines, and fit twice what we would consider a load here in Ireland!) and went back up to my room, and came down an hour later and just transfered the clothes into the drier, and called back an hour later, and my clothes were still there, so no worries there. All in all I would definately stay here again, oh yes I nearly forgot the best bit, infront of the hotel is the bahama breeze restaurant, oh my god, make sure you go there, the food is fantastic, the coctails are out of this world, I ordered one starter of onion rings between the four of us the first night i was there, and 14 huge onion rings (I kid you not!) came out on huge rectangular plate on a bed of lettuce with two seperate dips, and they were delicious, and were very reasonable, plus I discovered the first night in the bar that when you buy the kids a drink, you only pay for the first one, after that they get free refills for the rest of the night! I thought that was brilliant value, as you could be robbed blind in Ireland when out for a night! anyway if you're thinking of booking this hotel, go ahead, you will not be sorry, its a lovely safe, clean, friendly hotel, and excellent value for money, I think it worked out at 65 euro per night for the one bedroom suite I booked, which was good value, plus they also provide a free supper on Mondays through to Thursdays I think from 5 to 7 p.m., we only made it twice, as we were always out at the theme parks, and it was nice enough, pasta and meatballs and salad one evening, and some kind of ravioli I think on the other evening, and free drinks for the kids, and free glass of wine, and a top up, which was very good value.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "alberta, canada", "Title": "\u201cgreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "rudy897", "ReviewID": "UR117767703", "Content": "My family and I love this hotel.It is very clean.The free breakfast was a bonus with ample varieties.The 2 bed room suite that we stayed in was very nice and spacious.The staff were very nice and helpful.Will definitely stay here again.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brazil", "Title": "\u201cSecond time at Homewook Suites Orlando I'Drive\u201d", "Author": "Klettenberg", "ReviewID": "UR117718554", "Content": "It was the second time at this hotel, and we've decided to stay there again because we enjoyed our first stay a lot.

Fantastic service from housekeeping. All staff very good and helpful, especially in the dining area. Nice gym with modern machines. Decent pool for a dip after a day at the parks. This is not a 'resort hotel', ie it does not have a large fun pool and other amenities you would expect in a larger hotel, but if you want to use this as your holiday base, it is a great place to stay. Ideally located on I-drive, walking distance to loads of restaurants. We enjoyed eating at Uno and Houlihan's. Travel tips: Take the car for disney, book the free shuttle at reception for Universal, and take the i-ride to the Seaworld parks. Will save a fortune in parking costs.

First thing first, when I book a Hotel, it is because of the reviews posted on this trip advisor website; certainly I rely that the reviews are on the spot and truthful when it is time for me and my family to plan for a vacation. All I want is to enjoy the best Hotel experience equal to other trip advisor members; in this case it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t satisfied like I saw in the latest reviews. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s start when I first booked my room with a king and sofa bed layout I was told when making my reservation that the sofa bed was confortable, what a lie! My 15 year daughter couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep because the spring mattress. I approached the Hotel front desk to express my concerns and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to care about it, the supervisor with last name Roche only suggested that we could change to a two double room only if paying 80 dollars more putting the room total for 170 when in Orlando you can find a two queen layout for 110 tops (original price 90per night w/o tax and charges). I would have normally changed hotels but my daughter forgot a dress she needed to wear for a cruise night and my sister send me the package FedEx from Puerto Rico. To my surprise the Hotel charged me 10 dollars for receiving of the package and holding it for a couple of hours, wow! Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s start with the room conditions, my room was in the 4 floor in the 440s-460s, there were stains on the carpet, stains the sheets, pubic hair in the tube and for my surprise I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why, there were a bunch of pubic hair in a small towel with a sea shell design, I just took it and threw it on the floor. Personally I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the rooms design because the bathrooms sink is separated from the toilet and tub. For a sleeper like me and having a wife waking up early using the sink doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go well. In addition there were no ice makers in my floor I needed to go two floors down for ice or use the icemaker in the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fridge, I tried it but it was too noisy and it was 5 feet away of my daughter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sofa bed. The staff of this Hotel gives a bunch of lame excuses; I stayed in this Hotel from August 2 to August 6 and for no apparent reason in August 4 both electronic keys didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work at the same time, for some people this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a big issue but when you have a lot of kids playing around in the elevators and you got to use the bathroom and go back to an crowded front desk you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll remember me!! What the staff told me was that the electronics keys fail when there are close to electronics( but why two at the same time in different pockets), next day all rooms kept receiving newspapers except mine, in addition I stopped getting soap bars, I may add one small soap bar for 3 guest isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough. What to expect from this hotel is a good location well its dead smack on International drive, free grub if your into that and a lot of unattended kids playing through the hotel .

The kitchenette was a blessing after hours and hours walking and just having fast food. It's very near a Wal Mart, Wallgreens, the Premium Outlets, Universal, and the free shuttle to Disney Parks saved us a lot of $$$. The kids could only enjoyed the pool 2 or 3 times, and they had a blast, it's not a huge one, but ideal for kids. My husband tried the very first day the fitness center and it was ok. He didn't come back because all the walking we have at the parks, so he didn't need any extra workout. We love the laundry room, not so cheap, but we could do laundry the 4th and 7th day because we packed light. And for the price, really a bargain. The staff is really kind, but not overwhealming. And the breakfast was just OK, just eggs, sausages, baked potatoes, oatmeal, corn flakes, apples, grapefruit or bananas, yogurt, sodas, orange and apple \"juice\" waffles, pancakes, coffee, tea, milk. But it really helped us with the expenses and to get to the parks with a full stomach. The free wi-fi internet was a blessing when we returned by night to the hotel, just stayed in touch with ours, send some pics of the day.

Where we expecting too much? Where was the friendly, helpfull staff? No Porters, no friendly greeting, no directions to your room or even the lifts. Arrived on Sat 24th June at around 7pm and to be honest it is the first time that trip advisor has let me down. Rooms are large enough for our family of 3 but dont expect a nice modern 3-4 star room. The rooms are of a good size but they are dated with worn furniture,depressing,dated decor and a tiny toilet,shower area with very noisy A/C that if you want to sleep you have to turn off. Daily breakfast was ok if you dont mind eating the same thing day after day and you can put up with rude,and very gready adults and children who have no manners,choose not to stand in line for simple things like one of the two toasters! yes two! or even the coffee,waffle machine and after a while this can be very annoying. Managers reception is at best ok. having read on here how good this was i was so disapointed but i suppose it was free but the busloads of Americans returning from the parks attacked it every day as if they were being offered a slap up meal and we found this very amousing watching this take place. Pool area was a joke with limited sunbeds,Sunshine, it appeared as thou it was an after thought dropped in the middle of a high rise apartment with limited space and defo not very appealing. Asked the not so Friendly staff if there was another pool that could be used and they directed us to another hotel out the back of our main door? There are 4 hotels out there back door all of which had very friendly welcoming staff but none had any knoweladge of this sharing arrangment and the one pool we managed to gain access to we managed to get locked in as all doors leading from hotel pool were controlled. Hotel good points would be the location as very handy for I-Drive shoping,Restaurants etc but that would be the end of my list.

It had some good points - the rooms were clean and spacious, housekeeping was exceptional, beds really comfortable and the location is perfect, very close to some superb restaurants and a good base for all of the parks.

Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get me wrong, if we spoke to reception they were helpful and polite, but there was no warmth there. We had to go to Embassy Suites to pick up our car and what a contrast! We walked in to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood morning Ma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122am, Sir, how are you?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re really friendly, smiley people too, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not like we were walking around looking miserable. On checkout no-one asked if we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d had a nice stay or wished us a pleasant journey. There was no-one to help with luggage checking in or out. Aircon in the room is excessively noisy. The flow is directed right at the bed, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very hard to sleep when you have to choose between having a gale blowing at you and waking with a stiff neck or being really hot. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to cool the room down much anyway and the engineer said that it can only cool it down by 20 degrees less that the temperature outside. There was no aircon at all in the lift or our hallway on floor six. Pool was dire in our opinion. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shaded that's a problem, as we knew about that before booking; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the middle of a concrete jungle and just isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a nice place to sit around. There is very little space around it anyway. We would not stay here again and mainly because of the staff. Can't say they were rude, as they were fine if you approached them, but the words 'warm, proactive and attentive' must have evaded the management training here.

I have a thing about cleanliness and this hotel met my expectations. It was very quiet and the staff always spoke when passing you in the hallways. My only problem when staying here was the front desk clerks didn't seem to have any idea about a promotion in which I booked this hotel. It was through a SeaWorld package. Included in the package was a \"Benefits Card\" in which you are to receive when checking in. They claimed they never seen or heard of a Benefits Card (this allows you to receive the perks at the parks in which was included in the package deal). I called SeaWorld and the Customer Service Rep spoke to the desk clerk and Viola!!!! magically a Benefits Card appears (go figure). I was a little ticked off because I asked for it when I checked in and asked the next morning and they both assured me that was something they didn't participate in. Aside from that, it was an excellent stay. I think they had a beauty convention going on and the hotel seemed to be full. Breakfast was chaos, they couldn't seem to keep up with the demand of the number of guest by replacing the food once the buffet was empty. It was ok if u wanted to grab some toast or a bagel, but if you are not there from the start you will miss out. There is a Denny's next door, I'd suggest that or Ihop. The guy who worked the desk at night was extremely nice and friendly. Once again, if you are looking for a nice clean hotel this is it. They clean the rooms and restock whatever you use (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap, coffee, cups, tea etc). I liked the kitchenette in the room too. The tv's were a nice size too. This hotel is in an ideal spot. You don't have to drive to find a place to eat. Boston Lobster Feast is next door. Other places include, Bahama Breeze, Olive Garden, Joe's Crab Shack, Subways, Domino's Pizza, liquor store, camera shop and a 24hr Walgreen's.

We had a one bedroom suite at the front of the hotel. We arrived late in the evening to check-in and the staff greeted us warmly. They also allowed us to checkout late. Location: I like the location of this hotel. It is on I-Drive, not far from the action of the Drive. The hotel is off of the street so that it is not affected by the large volume of traffic on I-Drive. There are a variety of restaurants and some shops nearby to pass the time. We used Universal Drive to access the hotel most of the time since there is less traffic and it was easier to get around. You just have to remember to use the Hyatt Place sign as a guide as to when to turn. Room: The room was clean and well appointed. It was nice to have the sink outside the bathroom so that one of us could shower and the other get ready. We found the ceiling fan to be a little much in the bedroom and you couldn't turn the speed up because it would rattle around in the ceiling mount. The full size fridge and two burner cook top were nice. We liked the fact that the freezer would make ice for you as well. The furniture didn't show too much wear and tear. Our one critique would be that none of the lights would go one via the light switch, you always had to go to the lamp to turn them on. Generally: The breakfast was quite good and included in the cost. It wasn't too busy during our visit and it had everything that you needed to get started in the morning. My sister-in-law, who was staying elsewhere, thought it would be a great money saver for any family and it definitely got us past the lunch hour for food. The afternoon snacks with beverages was nice as well. If we had kids, we probably would have topped them off with some food at that time. The pool was small and not really in the sun given it is in the courtyard of the hotel but it was nice. It definitely wasn't as warm as some other hotels but when the temp is 95 degrees, you like a cool pool, not a warm pot. Would definitely stay here again in the future.

A tip, there is a outlet shopping mall with a character warehouse on each end of international drive , just get on the bus and tell them you want to go to the outlet mall. We found Disney bargains in both. There are plenty of restaurants to walk to from your hotel, we enjoyed the olive garden very much, just left on international from the hotel ,across the street and maybe a block or so, its a bit hidden. Denny is right outside, and again to the left on international is a subway which we went to a lot in our 10 day stay , and a Walgreen so buy some grocery's to put in our room, mostly we got drinks and ice cream. There are a few stores to your right on international, bargain world is one, that carry disney t shirts at a fraction of the cost ,and pretty much every souvenir you need , a few blocks further to the right is a McDonald and a chicken place sort of like KFC. If your going to use the trolley i recommend just getting a one week pass for like 10 bucks, then you just jump on and off all day long with your card, as you need exact change all the time it gets annoying .

Laundry machines on a couple of the floors, you buy the soap. They had a few items for sale , soups ,ravioli, beverages, ice cream bars, that sort of thing but more pricey than just walking to Walgreen. IF we ever go back to Florida, i was for sure stay at this hotel. The only thing I missed was a patio,oh well. The views from the 6th floor were excellent. WE had no complaints at all, and even enjoyed the free daily paper stuffed under are door. OH and we never heard anyone through the walls or in the halls. The pool is a plain rectangular pool, we never used it, but it did get used and enjoyed by others. I hear they offer free parking as well.

We were not disappointed. We stayed in a two bedroom, two bathroom suite, which my kids loved since they had their own room with two beds and a bathroom of their own. The price I paid was a tremendous value and extremely reasonable. The room was always cleaned spotlessly, the much-needed A/C worked flawlessly, and my wife and I commented on how really comfort6able the bed was. Although we didn't get a chance to have the light dinners, the complimentary breakfast buffet was far more than adequate. The outdoor pool was kept very nicely, and there were always families there to keep my kids company. Added bonus: some inflatables in the pool, provided by the hotel. It's amazing how simple stuff like this can go a long way keeping good graces with guests. The hotel was convenient also: about 15 minutes from Orlando International Airport, about 10 minutes from Universal Theme Park (just take Universal Blvd. right behind the hotel parking lot), about 5 minutes from Wet 'n' Wild Water Park (ditto), and about 20 - 22 minutes to Walt Disney World, mostly on highway 4. One good piece of advice: the hotel has a special desk for booking and information for Universal-based parks, such as the Theme Park, Busch Gardens in Tampa, Wet 'n' Wild, etc. It's open from 7:30 - 11:15 am every morning. Don't forget to say hello to Tosey if she's working there -- extremely helpful and friendly. She can also help get Blue Man Group tickets at Universal as well. Bahama Breeze is a short walk from the hotel and we ate there the first night. Having never been to one, I have to say I wish they had them in NY! Would we go back here? Absolutely. Nice staff. Really nice accommodations. Very good location. Excellent value.

Front desk also handled all my online shopping deliveries with ease. Free shuttle to all Disney and Universal theme parks was an added plus. All Universal parks tickets sold in the reception area including the fast pass. Disney tickets can be bought at the respective parks itself. The Visitors Centre on International Drive is a minute walk, they also sell Disney tickets but at an additional fee.

This was my second stay in Homewood Suites since August 2005. Stayed there again in June/July 2010. Situated perfectly on IDrive (a short walk from Wonderworks so its far enough from the seedy part of IDrive) its off the road and very quiet. They have a selection of two bedroomed suites and or one - we stayed in the one. If you have young kids the one bedroom is perfect as two big double beds easily fit into the room. Bathroom was very dated and needs an upgrade. Every room has a separate sitting room along with a massive fridge, cooker, table and chairs. Each room has a good size flat screen tv with lots of kids channels. There's also free internet access via wifi or from a computer on the ground floor that you can also print from free of charge. I heard when we were there they were in the process of redecorating the hotel which is probably required as it was a bit jaded but will be fine when its finished. There's a swimming pool and hot tub outside by the eating area but anybody staying in the hotel gets a free breakfast and a welcome back managers meal Monday to Thursday with free beer or wine - took advanage of that - it can save you quite a bit of money in terms of saving your dollars for a meal out at the weekend. I would suggest they consider changing the breakfast menu a bit more but its still decent although some people were a little surprised at the polystyrene plates - the solution is to bring the plates down from your room if it bothers you. Free shuttles take you to Disney or Universal Studio's including return - make sure you are there on time though or you will miss it. Room was cleaned and beds made everyday and were spotlessly clean. My only criticism of Homewood Suites is that there isn't a central location to meet - i.e. a bar (a wee cozy Irish bar would be perfect!!). Top notch hotel for price and when I am in Florida again I will definitely be staying there. Should also mention that the staff were top notch when we required anything - the manager in particular was very friendly and eager to ensure his guests were enjoying their stay.

The only thing it was missing was a hotel bar so you couldn't buy alcohol outside happy hour, although we had a big fridge and freezer in the room so could buy own own beer and food. The rooms didn't have balconies but this seemed to be the case for most hotels in the area and it would probably have been too hot! The free high speed wi-fi was amazing and meant we could connect via our mobiles and keep in contact with people. The free breakfast was great, lots of cooked food, waffles and cereal but it was a bit repetative after 10 days.

The hotel provides shuttle service to Disney and Universal each day. Be sure to book the shuttles the day before, especially with Universal, they only offer morning booking times for the following day. We arrived Thanksgiving Day and left the Wednesday after, so we did have a few days where there weren't as many families. The weekday travelers were business people.

The hotel is within walking distance of most restaurants and things to do on International Drive including a movie theater. The breakfast is great, free and full service, really helps with covering expensive park meal costs. We also used the fridge to keep food that we packed for the park each day.

Room spotlessly clean, with small kitchen area, full fridge, small cooker, kettle, microwave, complimentary tea and fantastic coffee and lounge area wtih window overlooking pool, which led through to the bedroom, again with large window overlooking the pool with huge big bed, and ensuite bathroom.

I actually asked her to call me a cab to go and workout at the Gold's Gym (1.9mi away) and she directed me to a black car outside the hotel. I truly thought nothing of it until I got in and the driver had no clue where the club was! Thank goodness for my iPhone! Oh, plus the cost for that short trip was $14, even after I asked him if it was extra for the added time it took to find it. So, back to the hotel. I liked my room as it had an open concept 1 bedroom with the kitchenette and the livingroom as you walk in. It leads to a nice king sized bed and the sink over to my left. Then the bathroom which was rather large! The service was superb! They did the few dishes that I had in the sink the whole week. There was never an issue finding your way around the hotel if you just asked. There was a gentleman that I saw at the front desk area (looked like a manager) who was extremely helpful each time I needed something.

I have stayed at both of the area Homewood properties, and if you put the two of them together you would have a perfect \"10\". The beds at both are very comfortable. All the appliances worked well, although aged and the positioning of the dishwasher made the door scrub the wall each time it was opened (not good design planning). The breakfast was the usual fare, extended somewhat with powdered eggs mixed with cheese or tomatoes, sausage links or patties, and the ever popular make-you-own waffles. The only disappointment was that the yogurt was heaped into a large bowl instead of individual sealed chilled cups. Bananas were not available everyday either, and why I point this out is that a yogurt and a banana are usually my \"grab and go\" breakfast. Another minor point is that they use smaller coffee cups and only regular non-flavored creamers. These are very small things but I miss having these items that were at the Homewood down the street. I tried this location this time instead since they have flat screen TVs in the rooms here; although I had to ask for a copy to be made for me of the channel directory, it was nice to have the flat screens for morning news. The workout room was small for the size of the property, but very well maintained with towels and water available, both very nice features. The business center was for the most part, useless. There are two very old and very slow terminals, usually occupied by children playing games while I am waiting to print out my boarding pass. The business center is at the very back of the hotel, and no remote printing is available; both frustrating omissions. I had only requested room cleaning every other day, but still had to ask for dishwasher detergent, or shampoo, as items were not regularly replenished. I don't know if this was due to varying housekeepers, or simply poor training of the staff. I do know this is a minimum expected service that was missing. Also it was frustrating that for an extended stay type of hotel that the laundry facilities were on the top two floors, again at the very back of the hotel. Okay, now for all of its minor issues, the best part is the location. It is set back from I-drive directly behind Howl-at the-Moon and next to the Hyatt Place. You can walk to more than a dozen different restaurants, Pointe Orlando, or the Convention Center from here. This is the best thing about this place, as you don't want to have to drive and park in the I-drive tourist area in the evening unless you have to!!!

We loved our room which was on the 3rd floor, however we would have prefered a smoking room which was not available. Reception informed us there may be one available in a few dasy and to check back with them. We had a smoking room within two days and all of our luggage / groceries were moved to the other room for us. The rooms are fab, and the beds are so comfy and huge!, if we could take it home with us we would! Great lounge /kitchen area with flat screen tv, also flat screen in bedroom. Bathroom spacious and shower was fab. The location is excellent. On previous visits to Orlando we have always hired a car but this trip we decided not to. There are plenyt of Restaurant s close by lots with lots of variety and one to suit every budget. It is also close to Pointe Orlando. As we didnt have a car we used the complimentary bus service to all the parks, the service is so efficient we never once had a problem, and hey no parking fees in the parks which @ $14 per day adds up! Breakfast very nice and included with room rate, lots of variety. Also the managers receptionl Mon - Thu 5-7pm was a bonus, we only ate at managers reception a couple of times but what we had was very nice. The best things about this hotel: the staff, the bed & the location. I honestly cant think of any bad points:,.....................................nope still cant think of any! Myself and my husband work in hotels and have done for almost 20 years so its an occupational hazard to sometimes be a little more critical than most but this hotel ticked all boxes for us.

We mainly chose the hotel because we needed 2 beds plus a sleeper sofa, and the location was convenient. Unfortunately, the main reason we needed the suite was for the sleeper sofa -- and it was completely unfit to sleep on! The \"mattress\" was approximately 1 1/2 inches thick, and not even one of the kids could sleep on it without feeling the metal bars and springs digging into their backs! Also, the blanket was probably 20 years old and threadbare -- an embarrassment for a Hilton family hotel. Seriously... I'm not being picky... it was literally \"un-sleepable.\" In addition to this, we had problems with the hot water in the shower. Maintenance came up quickly to fix it, but the \"fix\" only lasted for about 10 minutes and since it was late, we ended up dealing with cold showers in lieu of packing up and switching rooms. To be fair, I lodged my complaints in the morning with the front desk and asked for a rate reduction. The regular rate was about $125, and they removed $69. While this was fair, I really regret the choice of this hotel and would have been better off elsewhere. (We had previously stayed at the Sheraton Doubletree Suites and that was great.)

All staff are polite and courteous at all times. Got the impression nothing would have been too much trouble,(although we never had any reason to require help as everything was perfect). Breakfast is good quality and has cereals, fruit, yoghurts, breads, eggs every morning, hot alternatives, some days sausages, some days bacon etc. Fruit juices, teas coffee, something for everyone. Mon to Thurs is mangers reception, this has drinks, including beer, wine, juices etc. and a light meal. If you have had a big lunch at any of the numerous nearby restaurants, this is enough to cover your evening meal. If not, it is good to keep you going for a later meal. Rooms have cooking facilities if a night of self catering is required. Good size fridge with small freezer in kitchen. There is an ice maker in the hotel, discovered this after buying a bag at nearby liquor store! The living area is comfortable and has a nice plasma with loads of channels. This cannot be heard in the bedroom if door is closed and likewise the tv in the bedroom cannot be heard in the living area. Great if kids want to watch Disney Channel and adults want to catch upon on news/weather. Bedrooms are comfortable and lead onto good sized bathroom / shower area. Good pool, shaded if it is too hot that is welcome. Good whirl poot tub for aching muscles after a theme park day. Small fitness centre ok for a light workout, which is all that is needed if trudging around parks. The trip started out badly in Orlando as our travel agent mixed up hotels, so special mention to Homewood near universal as they arranged a taxi foc for us down to Int Drive. We bought magic your way Disney tickets from Toucan Travel that worked out cheaper than the UK Disney option tickets and 2 park Universal, didn't think we would have enough time for Seaworld, water parks, etc when visiting 4 Disney and 2 Universal parks. We were right! The hotel has a free shuttle to Disney. The shuttle goes to Epcot and you can use Disney transport from Epcot to Magic kingdom, Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom. It is really easy (honest, not as stressful as it may sound) and a real money saver. There is also a shuttle to Universal, though this picks up at other hotels and is really busy. This needs to be booked though the Universal desk in reception. It is $15 to $20 in a taxi, less stressful and allows you to visit later in the day. Lynx buses 8 and 42 transfer to no 37 which goes right into Universal for $6 all in tansfer return ticket. Good deal and again not as awkward as it sounds, the drivers announce where to go for the transfer. Itrolley is very busy and does not go too near to Universal, though if you get off at stop 7, it is about 1 mile walk, which is really long if a hot, humid day. Itrolley is good for visiting malls and other attractions on I drive, though Lynx may have better options, I did not fully investigate this option. IOA is currently very busy due to the boy wizard, Magic Kingdom pretty busy, but other parks reasonably quiet due to Harry Potter. Forbidden journey ride is a really good simulator. Fly on a broomstick! Roller coaster fans have to do the rip ride rock it, smoothest coatser I have ever been on. Ron and Roller coatser at Hollywood studios is surprisingly fast and caught us bt surprise, made for a funny photograph though! Nearby the hotel are numerous restaurants, such as Olive Garden, Tony Romas, TGI's, and Miller Alehouse, Don Pablo's Lobster Feats etc etc. also family American diners like Denny's and Friendly's. Also, late night revellers can frequent the Icebar and Howl at the Moon. A late night shop is nearby and a Walgreens that sell virtually everything you will need.

The hotel is in a good location in the middle of I-Drive. I-Trolley stop 21 and 22 are the nearest to the hotel. Point Orlando is 1 block away (approx 3-5 minute walk). There are great restaurants within a short walk - Bahama Breeze, Dennys, Friendlys, Tony Romas, Olive Garden, Houlahans, Sizzlers, Burger King, Subway. TGI Fridays. The hotel rooms were clean and spacious, 2 plasma TVs and a large King Size bed which was very comfortable. We didn't use the pool but it seemed nice, but was shaded for the most of the day. The breakfast each morning was nice but a bit monotonous every day - scrambled egg, cereals, pastries, doughnuts, juice, tea, coffee, toast and bread. It did save us a bit of money though so we did make the most of it. They also did a welcome home buffet Mon-Thurs with free beer and wine, which was also a nice touch and we made the most of this offer too. The staff were really helpful, when we arrived our room wasn't ready but we did arrive a bit early so the hotel took our cases and gave us vouchers to eat in some of the restaurants in the area while we waited.

There is a universal desk in reception, if you want to go on the shuttle to Universal book on it of a morning at breakfast. I think the pick up times from the hotel are 8.10a.m. and 9.50a.m. and then the pick up from universal is 4.20pm and 7.00pm. The hotel also do a shuttle to Seaworld and Aquatica but we just used the I-Trolley because it gave us more flexibility on the times, and it stops right inside both parks. We bought a 7 day pass for the I-Trolley for $10 each which was worth it because a single journey costs $1.25 - we bought the tickets at the Information Centre which is 1 block away also.

Staff were pleasant and helpful and general location on international drive was good; close to restaurants, not far from attractions.

We stayed in a one bedroom suite which included all amenities such as full size fridge/freezer, stove, microwave, dishwasher, etc. There was also a small dining area next to the kitchen. The bedroom is separate from the rest of the suite which is nice if one person wants to watch tv and the other wants to go to sleep. The beds were very comfortable, the most comfortable bed I've ever stayed in besides my own. I could not find any faults whatsoever with the room. The staff were also very nice and friendly throughout our stay. Every morning a complimentary breakfast was held in the lounge with a great selection of food and juices, we took advantage of this every morning as it was a great way to start the busy day at the parks! There is also a meal available from 5-7 Monday through Thursday which is also served buffet style. This is all included in your stay at the hotel at no extra charge. We also enjoyed being able to go for a swim outside in a secluded area at the hotel, while we were there it was cold for that time of year usually but this did not effect us being able to go for a swim as the pool was heated, so we were delighted! The hotel is 20 minutes from the airport, we decided to get a taxi as we were too tired from our long journey to wait around for a shuttle to the hotel. The taxi cost us $47 so we gave $50 including tip. We thought this was very expensive but after speaking to a family who took a bus to the hotel we were relieved with our decision. They told us that they paid $90 to get the bus to the hotel which also included their journey back to the airport but they said that it took them 2 hours to get to the hotel with all the stops and that the bus driver got lost. The taxi back to the airport cost us $45 including tip so we would definitely recommend getting a taxi as it is only $5 cheaper to get the bus which is a lot more hassle! The hotel itself was in a lovely area and was very central on international drive. There are many attractions and restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. I would recommend going into wonder works as we found it very fun and interesting. Also I would recommend the Ice Bar. You pay $20 each to get into the ice bar, your first drink is $10 and then the pinnacle brand vodkas are only $5 dollars after that! It is definitely worth the money, inside the walls, bar, glasses and seating are all made out of ice and the room is kept at 27 Degrees F. You get gloves and a big jacket to wear when inside. We were a bit disappointed that one of the girls was very rude to us when we were going outside for a cigarette (to warm up!) and told us that we were only supposed to be in there for 45 minutes, this is something we were unaware of as no one told us previously before we went in, just something to watch out for, but otherwise it was definitely worth the money to see this! There are free shuttles to all the parks that we wanted to go to but you need to book your times the day before as there are only a limited number of seats. This included Disney which you get dropped off outside Epcot. If you are looking to go to other Disney parks there is complimentary transportation from this location. There were also shuttles available for the other parks we went to, Sea World and Universal Studios. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is travelling to Orlando, it is worth every penny and is in a great location.

Anyway, very clean hotel, not huge rooms but way bigger than Disney All Star rooms which we stayed at a few years ago. Very nice, updated. We never got back in time for the Mgr's reception but did enjoy the breakfasts practically every day. Liked the area - upscale and away from the pandomonium of other closer areas.

Was really nervous about International Drive hotels as heard some bad stories about them and considering what we paid I was not hopeful! However the hotel was fantastic.

Then a sitting room come kitchen with table and chairs, a double sofa bed and another flatscreen t.v. The rooms were spotless and cleaned daily. The housekeeping staff (all spanish speakers) were lovely and not intrusive. There was bfast included in our package and it really made a difference every morning not having to cook yourself or go out to eat. The food was ok, nothing great but it did the job. It was a buffet style where you helped yourself. Gets really busy after 9 a.m. so get down early if you can! (Beware of the signing waiter, he comes to your table, sings a song and you are meant to tip him!!!! It is hilarious on day one but by day 10 it is extremely annoying!!!!) The swimming pool area was nice and the kids often went for a swim after a long day at the park. It was really safe here and I had no problem letting the children out of the room to play around the hotel with friends they made. The free transfers to and from all the parks was fantastic, always on time and never any problems. The bus drivers were all lovely and its well worth giving them a tip at the end of your trip as it was such a relief to have a hassle free service for the 2 wks. The hotel itself is in a prime location on International Drive(what appears to be the cleaner end of the drive), right beside Walmarts and there is a small outdoor shopping centre 5 mins walk with a cinema, a hooters bar (food is great here and its child friendly) and some nice shops mainly Victoria Secrets and Hollister. Lots of other bars and restaurants within 2-5 mins walk. The IHOP bus service goes up and down the drive regularly and is a fantastic way to get to the shopping outlets, there is an outlet at each end of the drive.

We arrived at the hotel in the late evening. Check in was a breeze, the staff exceptional, and the lobby was really nice. A good start, but certainly not the highlight. Once we got to the room we were even more pleased. The room was really clean and had the amenities (and more) one would expect in a Homewood Suites. 2 t.v.'s, a dinner table a full fridge, dishwasher, stove to burners, microwave, etc. The rooms were, well, roomy, the showers hot, plenty of towels, pillows, etc . . I could go on and on, but I don't see the point . . what nice accomodations. My only observation was that the carpet appeared to have a couple of cigarette burns in a no-smoking room. A small thing that really had no bearing on my stay. After all can you really expect a hotel to replace an entire carpet just because one jerk decides to be inconsiderate? I certainly don't think so, and since the room had NO smoking odor this was a non-issue with me. The beds were really comfortable and the room exceptionally quiet. Being a light sleeper this was a great benefit. Both mornings we woke up the breakfast bar was packed, and for good reason. Without a doubt this is the best breakfast bar I have ever had. Please keep in mind that I am VERY mindful of cost, and the facilities I stay at reflect this. But never the less - wow. As crowded as that bar was, the staff never let the food run out, and there was plenty of seating. Also, if you want to eat away from the hotel there are 20 restaurants within a 5 minute walk, so knock yourself out.

We didn't cook anything in our room, as we ate out all the days we were there, so can't comment on that side of the facilities. The hotel is VERY close to some great eating places such as Tony Romas, TGI Fridays and a fab Mexican place literally around the corner (can't remember the name). Hotel has a small pool in the central courtyard, which was quiet most of the days we were there. Breakfast was good, given that it is included in the price, however only thing that bothered me was the fact that you had to eat from plastic disposable plates and plastic knives and forks - easy to dispose of when the staff clear up and I guess saves on employing staff to do dishes and washing up!!

The I-Ride Trolley bus runs the length of International Drive. This will take you to the 2 main Shopping areas, Prime Outlets and Premium Outlets. All journeys cost $1.25, or you can buy a 1, 3 or 7 day passes, you can hop on and off for $4 a day. We found this hassle free \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no getting lost, looking for parking, parking fees etc. There were only two places we had to get a taxi to - Walmarts and Florida Mall. You might have to hire car to visit Disney. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure you will find cheaper Hotels, but the money you save on Breakfast- Evening snacks and Free Shuttle is fantastic. Would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely visit again. Shopping Tips. If your looking for bargains then you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go wrong with Walmarts, they carry all the official Disney merchandise and Orlando gifts, open 24 hours. Check out Ross Stores and T.J. Max (I Ride stop No. 4) before you go to the outlets, great value for marked down designer handbags, shoes and clothes. I picked up a Jessica Sinpson bag for $59. Google the shopping malls before you go, most of them will allow you to register online or print voucher for VIP Coupon books. Then you can print or pick up Coupon Book from customer service, this will give you an extra discount on top of whatever discount the shops are already offering.

The complementary breakfast sets you up for the day. It can become a bit repetative by the end of 2 weeks but a least you can still have a bowl of ceral and a coffee. The most annoying thing this year was the introduction of a theatrical singer who went around the tables asking the diners if they would 'like a song'. A nice chap but the booming voice was a bit too much at that time of the morning - I think the hotel should have a re-think!!! The hotel is well located between I Drive and Universal Bollavard close to several good restaurants. Within a short walking distance are Bahamma Breeze, Olive Garden, TGI Fridays and several others in the Point complex. Also relatively close by are the usual establishments like, Subway, Sizzler, Ponderossa, Pizza hut, etc. The crazy golf course 'Pirates Cove' complete with water falls etc is within a few hundred metres and is well worth a visit. Wonderworks is also just around the corner. The hotel is located between Sea World & Aquatica in one direction and Universal and Wet and Wild in the other (a couple of miles both ways). Ideal for those purchasing the Flexi Tickets. However Disney is around 10 miles away and you may find this distance a bit of a drag (like we did) if you intend going on a regular basis. The hotel represents very good value for money but while it may have the Hilton name it is not 5 star. If you get a good rate I would certainly recommend it.", "Date": "November 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buenos Aires", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay at Orlando\u201d", "Author": "Travelling-Argie", "ReviewID": "UR48336918", "Content": "I've stayed 3 nights in Jan 2009.

This was my 3rd time at this hotel and my hubby's first time. I have to say I cannot fault the place and would go back in a heartbeat. Check in was a breeze we asked to be placed in a non smoking room and overlooking the pool, we received this without any hassle an nice room on the 3rd floor.The staff were all very attentive and friendly and nothing was ever too much trouble. The room was clean, the bed very comfy and the cleaning staff were very good with the room being tidied everyday and clean towels delivered everyday. The room is very equipt with large fridge/freezer, microwave, hob, dishwasher and all the utensils, though we didnt use them as we ate out so much and breakfast is included! Breakfast was served every morning 7-10am and had a good variety of food, enough to fill anyones belly. The Managers special is a treat, Mon-Thurs from 5.30-7.30 there is wine/beer and a different menu everynight so you have a bite to eat. It was great if you had just come back from a park and didnt fancy heading out for dinner after a big lunch and again the staff were fantastic. Some people have complained about the pool, I found the pool was good, its not huge and there is not alot of lounger space, but we never had a problem getting a bed as it was always very quiet. Lots of little geikos running around, really cute and meant no insects !!! The pool was closed one day during our stay from morning til 5.30 whilst the repainted the whole area, it did not bother us as we were out to a park, but they had arranged use of another hotels pool for those who may have wanted some pool time. There is a gym which i didnt venture to as i did enough walking round the parks, the laundary facilities are based on the 5 & 6th floors and were adequate, i didnt have to worry about bringing home aload of washing which was great. There is a business centre which is good for checking flights etc, we found this useful as we didnt bring a laptop. This hotel is only rated as a 3 star compared to a 3 star here in Ireland it should be at least a 4/5 star. It is in a great location close to Pointe Orlando and lots of good restaurants nearby, it saved us money as we had breakfast included and the managers special and also it had complimentary shuttles to all the parks again saving us a packet!

Also a sofa bed in living area which we have used for our 9 yr old daughter. Maid service daily with a change of towels (and you get plenty of them). Hotel staff - Mario the asst. manager has been mentioned a few times in the reviews and we can agree and also add he and the rest of the staff we have had the pleasure to deal with have all been fantastic and very professional. We wanted to buy a laptop whilst here in Orlando and asked Mario's advise on where to go. He had no idea but within a minute he was on his phone to his nephew for advise. He also arranged for reception staff to print off details and had them delivered to our room. What more can you ask!!!!! Plus points - Monday - Thursday welcome home refreshment 5pm-7pm. This includes as an example Monday - shredded pork accompanied with salads,soup, crisps, pretzels etc..... Wine , Lager, soft drinks and coffee. Tuesday - Hot dogs and as above. Wednesday - fajita chicken etc, Thursday - rotisserie chicken etc. This can be a big saving for families. Breakfast - every morning (Between 7-10 am) and consists of scrambled egg, Sausage , fried mini potatoes, cereal, toast, muffins and waffles. Coffee, tea and fresh fruit juice. Again we have found this a real saving. The hotel also offers free Internet access in room and also has a separate room with two computers for guest use and this is free with your room key. Please note there is free transport to the theme parks. Universal studio's leaving at 8.25 or 10.50 am returning at 4.20 or 7.10 pm Disney leaving at 8.20 or 10.20 am returning at 7.15 or 9.45 only. This we found can be a long day and would have preferred an earlier option !!! Swimming pool - we read reviews about the pool.It catches the sun from 10.30 but is gone by 2.30 ish pm, otherwise the pool is clean and there are pool towels provided. Today we asked reception if we could keep the room on until 4.30 pm and they agreed. no problem and at no charge.We have asked this at other Hotels and have charged for this option. Overall an excellent hotel, Professional staff and would highly recommend a stay here !. p.s...On a totally different note, Flew with VIRGIN and never again.Staff not helpful ( a smile would be nice ). Food, no choice at row 37 !!!!!! no lager left 3 hours into flight ( so much for free drinks only one offer of bar service ).

We also read the negative reviews and have a hard time understanding their point of view. We were satisfied beyond expectations with this hotel. We visited Orlando for the Disney and Universal parks, and a work-related conference. After researching many Orlando hotels online, Homewood Suites on International was our choice for several reasons- the reviews from other guests; the proximity to our destinations; our preference over a suite vs.a plain room; free and good breakfast; walking distance to several restaurants and Pointe Orlando. During our stay, I saw the manager (Mr. Rodriguez) at the breakfast area several times. He usually had a cup of coffee in his hand and a smile on his face. It was nice to see that the manager took a personal interest in something as mundane as breakfast for his guests. As a totally subjective comparison -- we moved to the Grand Cypress Resort for a conference after staying at Homewood Suites. Totally different vibe at GC - beautiful hotel, different level of accommodations, amenities and prices. Grand Cypress has a lot to offer. But I will, without a doubt, return to Homewood Suites the next time we visit Orlando.

Upon arrival of the hotel we were greated by a friendly receptionist who sorted out our room as quickly as possible. I had rang up the week before my trip to arrange the particular room that I required and they met my requests so it was perfect. The first thing you notice when you enter th hotel is the lovely clean smell and the friendly faces. When we entered our room it was spotless!!!! The only down side is that the room was not as big as last time we stayed and there was three of us living in the room but that didn't matter because in the day we put the sofabed away so there was plenty of space for us. The breakfast in the morning was fantastic, just what you needed to start the day with all that walking. My son particularly loved the waffle machine. Evey morning one of the hotel managers would great us and ask how we were. The only down side is that the swimming pool does not get a lot of sun so you have to pick the best spec at the right time to catch the sun, but to be honest this time when we went it was hotter then ever so we spent most of the time in the pool cooling off!!!! The room maid was lovely and cleaned our room everyday and put the dish washer on with our dirty glasswear. The best part of the room though was the MASSIVE COMFY bed. It was the best bed ever and I bet you could get four adults in it. The location was fantastic. It took five minutes in the evening to walk to the restaurants so you did not have to drive anywhere. The day before we left the manager of the hotel personally rang us to see how our stay was which is a nice touch. The only tip I will give is that you get a lot of take away leaflets posted under your door and DO NOT ORDER from any of them as they are a con only order from the take away menus which the hotel provides in your room.

The next morning we heading for an early breakfast, this was good also, not the continental I was expecting but no complaint from me, plenty of choice so most tastes should be happy and plenty of it also. Headed out for the day to come back to a cleaned room with coffee re-stocked.

Gym was ok (3 running machines, 1 bike, 1 cross trainer and an selection of dum bells) but for me could have done with a 'multi gym' style weights machine but not real a problem just a prefference. During Monday - Thursday Evenings the complimentry food and beverages is a nice touch, a refreshing start prior to heading out for a bit of evening entertainment.

Firstly, a family who would not have looked out of place on Jerry Springer in the room below us - shouting and swearing at their children etc which we could hear clearly in our room; secondly, the couple in the neighbouring room who firstly kept us awake with their shouting then when we finally got to sleep, woke the whole family up at 3am fighting which again we could hear quite clearly. My 8 year old thought repeating some of the swearing was really funny!!! Fortunately, Security came straight up when we rang and in the morning we spoke to the General Manager who was extremely apologetic and said he would talk to them as a report had been received by the night staff.

The rooms are spacious and the huge kingsize bed is so comfy. The sofa bed is just that a sofa bed and my 17 year old did complain a bit. Flatscreen TVs in both the living area and the bedroom. There is a small kitchen area which I never used, was not there to cook etc but the fridge was invaluable used it to keep drinks and snacks cool, even kept the aftersun cream in the fridge. The rooms were exceptionally clean and there was maid service every day. Breakfast is provided every day: cereal, porridge, sausages, potato cubes, scrambled eggs, bread, bagels, french toast, english muffins, danish pastries, fresh fruit, tea, coffee and breakfast juices, there is also waffle machines so you can make your own waffles. If you can't make a breakfast out of all that that something is wrong. One word of warning a guy comes in most morning dressed as a chef and sings, the first time you see this it is quite amusing but after a few days it does get on your nerves and by the end of the holiday you are near nuts listening to him. He seems to be doing this for money, people were tipping him. Maybe this is something new they are trying but going by the expressions on people's faces it is a bad move. There was a welcome home reception from Monday to Thursday and the best bit of this is the free beer and wine. Food was also on offer it was nearly always some sort of pasta dish, some salad stuff, soup and crisps and dips. Not bad for a snack if you are about but I wouldn't rush home for it. I myself enjoyed a few beers by the pool with a bowl of crisps or nachos and a dip, now how relaxing does that sound. The breakfast room can be used all day every day . People gather there in the evening, bring their own drink, order a pizza, bring snacks and sit and have a chat it is quite relaxing after a hectic day. The pool closes at 10.00pm because it is in the centre of the hotel and there are bedrooms all around it so quiet has to be restored at some point. The location is excellent, just off International Drive behind Bahama Breeze. You can walk to International Drive in about 2 minutes and because the hotel is set back of the road a bit it is nice and quiet. There are plenty of restaurants within 5 minutes walk. Wonderworks, Ripley's Believe It Or Not and Pirates Cove Crazy Golf are all within walking distance. Olive Garden Italian Restaurant is just across the road from the Bahama Breeze and is a must, meals are fantastic and I was pleasantly surprised at the price, 5 adult meals, a good bottle of red wine and several vodkas came in at $148 a lot cheaper than I expected and the surroundings are lovely. Would avoid the Ponderosa, always thought the Ponderosa was cheap and cheerful especially for families, well it is certainly not cheerful and in my opinion it has gone down hill badly. The hotel also has a gym, a computer room, free WIFI, several games machines for the kids and laundry facilities. They will even do some grocery shopping for you if you leave them a list. There is no restaurant in the hotel but you can order food in from TGI Fridays and a few other food places. Only order food from the places recommended by the hotel and these you will find at the back of the welcome folder in your room. Leaflets are pushed under your door every day from various other food outlets but do not use these the food is rubbish, we found this out to our cost.

My only complaint is that the elevator is so slow, plus there is only one for each side of the hotel, the free wireless internet kept getting cut off, and though the beds were perfect to sleep on, they can use new linens, they were dingy with some holes. When I travel I always bring my air mattress in case I can't sleep on the beds, because I start itching, but I didn't use it cause I had no problems sleeping on their beds, my husband was shocked. Also the pool is located in the middle of the hotel and that minimizing the amout of sunlight to be in that area, so if you want a tan, then timing is everything. Breakfast was pleasant not too busy, enough tables, a lady went around giving crayons and coloring books to the children,which made them happy. I thought that was sweet.

All the staff we dealt with were friendly and professional and really made you feel welcome , but without being overbearing or intrusive.

I find this section the best for family friendly restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. Tony Roma's , Bahama Breeze, TGI's are all less than a couple of mins walk. The hotel has a free breakfast buffet every morning which is great when you're travelling with your family cos it can save you time and money of the course of your holiday. The buffet itself is more than adequate - plenty of choice for Juices, Tea, Coffee, pastries, Cereals, Yogurts, Fruit, Muffins, Pancakes etc. They aren't as many Hot Food choices - mainly scrambled eggs , hash brown (or cubed potatoes as we'd call them !) and sausage patties (not traditional \"linked sausages\") but as I said , more than enough choice to keep everybody happy. The hotel also has plenty of laundry rooms spread out across the different floors of the hotel, a small business centre (internet etc) , a small gym and a nice pool area with an adequate size pool and hot-tub.

They did make the beds consistently, but that was the only thing that was the same. One day our room did not get service at all, one day no wash clothes, some days we got shampoo/soap, sometimes not. We had to change rooms because the neighbors had screaming children, and when the children would scream, the parents would scream right back... all hours of the day and night.

We intended to save money by cooking for ourselves in the evening and making sandwiches to take to the theme parks with us but once we got there we ditched this idea and pretty much always ate out. With this in mind, I think the Suite style rooms at Homewood would be better for a family but it was still useful for us. The breakfasts at the hotel were lovely with a selection of different foods and tea/coffee/juices to drink. We only managed to catch the free dinner on one night we were staying there but that was also very nice and we couldn't complain about the free beer and wine! The location was ideal for the theme parks with several different free shuttles running to all the main parks. Taxi's were generally quite reasonable to the different malls and outlets, there's always one that wants to rip off unsuspecting tourists! Alternatively, the I-Ride bus offered very cheap travel up and down International Drive.

Having read the reviews on the Homewood Suites I was happy that we had chosen a good hotel. I dont consider myself to be over fussy but when we arrived at the hotel it was a bit of a let down. The room we were given was on the 6th floor which is the smoking floor. I hate the smell of smoke at the best of times ( ex smoker!! ) and I asked for a non smoking room. There were no rooms available. To cut a long story short the reception did not seem to care that I wanted a non smoking room and talking to other people they put all the British people on the 6th floor in the smoking rooms. I did not meet one American on the 6th floor!! I suspect this is because they would complain bitterly about the smell of smoke. I spent 14 nights at the hotel - the least they could of offered was to move us to a non smoking room when one became available. There never was a room on offer. I also asked for a kettle for our room. The reception said could I wait a couple of days. I said I could. Again - no kettle ever arrived. when I asked the reception she just shrugged her shoulders. I didnt care too much because I boiled water in a pan. But I do think a kettle is a fairly basic requirement in any hotel room let alone one with a kitchen! Maybe I am being a bit picky! But generally the rooms were very clean and the beds were very comfortable - really comfortable actually. The fridge was a great size and very cold which was great for cold water. Having 2 tvs was great for my two teenagers! The bathroom was very clean and the shower very powerful which more than made up for the lack of a kettle!! the complimentary soap and shampoos are good quality. the kitchen equipment more than adequate and the complimentary tea and coffee sachets gratefully received. Breakfast - Well again I have to say I am going to moan. The food was good. BUT it was difficult to find a table. It was very overcrowded and felt more like a school canteen at times. I saw on a couple of occasions people fighting over tables. The quality of the food was good but there is a lack of variation. The coffee though was great. Pool - all said before. Small and in the shade. Orlando is not a holiday where you will be doing much sitting by the pool anyway. The complimentary shuttles were very good. We used them a lot. Never a problem getting on them, Eating out - we went to Dennys on the first night - it is so close to the hotel - I found out the next night that if you show your room key you get 15% off your total bill. Food was adequate. TGI Friday - Good Sirloin steaks and good service although you pay a little more. Friendlys over the road from the hotel - same as Dennys really - good fast food. Not for the healthy types!! Ponderossa - I did not like this place at all. It reminded me of school dinners!! The price is good but the surroundings are poor and the poor staff look knackered! Domino pizza is 5 mins walk - Great!! Good value deals and great taste if you like pizza. Ci Ci pizza is a few stops on the I trolley. Great deal if you are really hungry. $5.99 all you can eat buffett with salad ( limited choice ). The pizza choice is good although do not expect too much topping. At the end of the day its cheap and tastes good. The buffet also includes 2 puddings!! Cant be bad. I bought my flexiticket plus from Charter Travel for \u00c2\u00a3154. This was good value. Disney is expensive and very very crowded. go if you can out of the school holidays. There are two shopping centres at either end of the I Drive. Premium outlets and Prime outlets. Both offer designer clothing at discounted prices. Great if you like that kind of shopping. Florida mall was a more normal shopping experience with more normal shops - its where the Americans shop. Look out for discount vouchers for almost everything - all the attractions and restaurants. Well thats it really. Over all the Homewood Suites were good value at \u00c2\u00a362.00 -per night for all 3 of us so I suppose I should not be complaining at all.

The reason we stayed here was because it suited our needs and had such great reviews. Our essential requirements were; an I-Drive location, a heated pool (it was February!), free transport to the parks, an inclusive breakfast and clean rooms. The location was excellent. Just off I-Drive, no traffic noise, good local shops and restaurants and 1 minute to both the Red and Green Line trolleys. The hotel itself was very clean, the staff was very helpful (not that we really had any problems anyway), the concession staff was also great. The breakfast was more than enough for us and never crowded. The pool was heated and great for splashing around or a few laps, but not for sunbathing as it's mostly all in shade for most of the day, but you can use other local hilton hotel pools anyway. We preferred the shaded pool to be honest. The free internet access was good too. We used \"the business centre\" which is basically a smallish room with two PCs and a printer - good enough for checking email and surfing the web. Our room was a suite (a lounge with a small kitchen with a table and chairs and the couch pulled out into a double bed and a separate bedroom with an en suite bathroom). We loved the extra space that the lounge seating gave us in between being asleep and being out all day. The room safe was great too, large enough for the essentials but not big enough for a laptop (I'd guess about 10x8 inches and 8-10 inches deep) and we weren't charged for it, although we used it daily. The free transport ran twice every morning to all the parks; one shuttle to Disney and another to all the Universal parks, SeaWorld and Aquatica. And coming back, there were also early (6pm ish) and late (9.30pm ish) shuttles. We found all the drivers very helpful, knowledgeable and courteous. Well worth a few dollars tip. Disney transport was booked at reception, other transport was booked by the concession staff. Only once was the disney shuttle (the early one) full when we tried to book it, necessitating a quick change of plan - no problem. We were very happy with our stay here.

We chose this hotel over the other hotels offered by our convention that were in walking distance to the convention center. Although we had a choice of taking our convention center scheduled shuttle or the local I-trolley we found it better to be closer to the restaurants and enteraintment. Those staying at the convention center hotels had to walk or take taxis to us and the restaurants. This hotel was nearly full every night we were there, but the staff did a great job at the breakfast time and evening social hour keeping food and drinks supplied. I used the gym once and it was clean but had limited equipment. I also utilized the free wi-fi and found it fast and easy to connect to. I like the Hilton family of hotels and think that thier Hilton Honors program is one of the best since I can double dip with my airline miles. Just around the corner from the hotel is a good steak house, Howl at the Moon, Bahama Breeze and a TGI Fridays (they deliver to the hotel along with a local pizza place).", "Date": "March 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burnley", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay!

ARRIVAL After booking with Travel City Direct, we made the walk through Sanford to the transfers exit. Our 2 reps were there to meet us, and directed us to the exchange booth, where we should exchange our transfer vouchers for coach tickets. Once on board the coach, another rep came on and explained to us how long it would be before we got to our hotel. She briefed us on our resort, giving us plenty of maps, guides and voucher booklets (discounts on theme park tickets, restaurants etc) . She then left the coach, explaining that we would have a long wait until the coach set off, due to a family stuck in immigration. Finally, we set off and our hotel was one of the first to be dropped off as it was at the end of International Drive. The rep was not on the coach at this point and the coach driver snapped at us when we asked him which of four hotels in the grounds was ours. On arrival, the porter was waiting at the door of the hotel to help us with our luggage. Here is where the good stuff begins! CHECK-IN / ARRIVAL AT ROOM Don, the porter, carried our bags to the reception desk, and the polite, friendly staff checked us in. We were given a key to a room on the 2nd floor and our bags were carried up. On arrival at the room, we were given a full tour of the room and we were asked if there was anything we would need straight away. There was nothing, no queries about our wonderful room, so the porter left. ROOM In our room, we had an open-plan kitchen/living area with a sofa-bed (double) which our children slept in. In the kitchen area, there was a fully equipped kitchen and seating. The living room contained a plasma tv with all the channels we could ever want. We also had a master bedroom with an en-suite bathroom. This contained a plasma screen, a kingsize bed and chairs and 2 large wardrobes. Safes were available at an extra charge. The bathroom was in good condition and was kept well cleaned and equipped throughout our stay. REST OF HOTEL The rest of our hotel was outstanding as well. There was a jacuzzi, a large swimming pool, a games room, a large dining area, a mini-market and a baggage storage area. There were always plenty of sunbeds available as most guests were out at the park all day. Breakfast was a good choice - serving continental and cooked. Monday-Friday 5pm-7pm, the hotel ran a welcome home reception where soft drinks, beer and wine were free, as were snacks. A shuttle service was also complimentary - although you do have to book in advance. To go to the parks in the morning the shuttles were as follows: 1) 7am 2) 8:30am 3) 11:30am And coming back from the parks was 1)4pm 2)6pm 3)8pm 4)10pm The hotel overall was great and the staff could not do anything more. PARK TICKETS Just a word of warning - unless you want to be ripped off at the Park Entrance - book your Disney tickets back in the UK! The hotel sell tickets for Wet 'N' Wild and Universal but no Disney tickets are available. They are sold at discount prices and you can pick many discount books up from restaurants/bars that can get you an extra discount if you know where to use them. DISNEY PARKS One word - AMAZING! Bring the magic of Disney alive as you visit: Epcot - The \"World of Tomorrow\" park Magic Kingdom - The \"Little Kids/Big Kids\" Park Hollywood Studios - For all you thrill seekers out there! Animal Kingdom - Animal Lovers- you can travel to Asia, Africa and much more! Blizzard Beach - The best Disney water park there is Typhoon Lagoon - Good, but not as good as BB! My ride recommendations are Epcot - \"Test Track\" and \"Mission: Space\" Magic Kingdom - All of them! Hollywood Studios - Tower of Terror and Rock'N'Rollercoaster Animal Kingdom - Expedition Everest and Kilimanjaro Safaris Blizzard Beach - Summit Plummit and Water Wavers Typhoon Lagoon - Wave pool and the big water slide Enjoy your stay at Homewood!", "Date": "February 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ireland", "Title": "\u201cbrilliant\u201d", "Author": "floridastar", "ReviewID": "UR24119466", "Content": "This was our second visit to this hotel and it is better than ever.. going back feb 09", "Date": "February 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aintree,Liverpool,UK", "Title": "\u201cLoved Homewood Suites\u201d", "Author": "Robrud&family", "ReviewID": "UR23884273", "Content": "Stayed here Feb 2008 for two weeks, great hotel, great staff, the free breakfast is a excellent and so is the free beers ,wine and food during the week!!.

I got an amazing rate of $39/night through Priceline which was more than we ever could have bargained for. It also gave me very low expectations. We have stayed at Homewood Suites in the past and have been pleased with them overall and were anxious to see how this compared to the other locations we stayed at. I had read TripAdvisor reviews of the property and it sounded perfectly fine so we gave it a go. Keep in mind we were in Orlando in the off-season; this may have affected our experiences with crowds, etc. We arrived on a Tuesday night. The hotel was marked by a sign on the street and could be missed if you weren't really paying attention as it is set back from the street. But I had done my research and found it without problem. There was plenty of parking right near the front entrance. Parking did fill up in the evening but I never had trouble getting a good spot. I walked right up to the front desk where I was greeting warmly by the desk clerk and checked right in. The type of room we wanted was available and I made sure to ask for one of the already renovated rooms. The only thing it didn't have was the new TVs. The room was similar in size and layout to the other HS we've stayed in. The room was clean and well taken care of with the usual HS amenities. The only downside was the new remodel removed the towel rack/shelves from the vanity area. Consequently there is no place to hang a hand towel for drying your hands. Not a big deal. The daily breakfast was adequate and welcome. The BEST part of their food service was a soda machine! I am one of those people who wants Diet Coke with every meal and I was able to have it! The dinners were also adequate but not spectacular. (We were spoiled at the Homewood Suites in Alexandria and compare all others to it!) But it was included and we ate there a couple of the evenings. It was sometimes busy but never crowded and gave us a good opportunity to chat with our fellow travelers. Didn't use the fitness center. The pool was big enough and not at all crowded (again, it was November). The business center was hot and stuffy, but free internet access is always welcome. There were occasional issues with the printers, but nothing major. I would recommend the Homewood Suites for a clean, comfortable stay. The staff was nice, the room was clean, the food was adequate, and we couldn't beat the price! And it was really nice to have a separate room to go to when it was kiddie bedtime!

Located on International Drive (closer to Wonderworks than the Convention Centre) it's a bit back from the road and nice and quiet. If you're looking for it on Google Maps Street View you won't see it (this worried me before I went) - the best thing to do is find Howl At The Moon on International Drive - 8700 or so. It's just behind there. The rooms - one main living room with a kitchenette (the fridge was huge!), a seperate bedroom and a bathroom - were clean, spacious and always well looked after. The maid even stopped completely redressing my bed every day after I left her a note asking not to. The hotel pool is very small and is surrounded on all sides by the tall (at least four stories) hotel block so if you want to sunbathe there you'll need to move around the sides. Truth be told though the Homewood Suites' pool - and every other pool in Orlando - cannot compete with Disney's waterparks so I haven't marked it down for this. The hotel serves breakfast from 7 till 10 (at 10 they are still putting fresh food out) and this is nice if you don't want to go out to the Ponderosa, Golden Corral or any of the other places. The staff are really polite and friendly - we didn't encounter anyone having a bad day on our entire stay.

We had the best time ever in Orlando thanks to this fabulous hotel. We have stayed in many others on International Drive and were not expecting the elegance and poshness that we got here! The Check In: When we arrived at the hotel we were shocked that for what we had paid, this hotel was so much more. We had called the Hilton helpline 2 days prior to check in to request a ground floor room (for medical reasons) and when we arrived to check in was reassured this would be fine and our we had a choice of room views. We decided to overlook the pool. The staff were so friendly and nice we felt at home straight away. We were directed to our rooms and offered assistance from the bellhop. The Room: The room was outstanding, it looks as good in the pictures as it does in reality, which is often not the same. The kitchen area was very nice and clean, the dishwasher was free of charge and the maid put it on each day for us. There was nice clean cutlery and pots, pans and crockery provided for us in the drawers and cupboards. The microwave was huge and could cook almost anything. The fridge was very big too. There was a dining table in the kitchen area also with 4 chairs. In the living room was an arm chair and a sofa (which was a pull out bed too). As a party of 3, finding a hotel with decent bed space is tricky. But this hotel once again exceeded expectations. In the bedroom we had a king size bed, which 2 people slept in. The 3rd person slept in the double sofa bed that was in the living room. All sheets were changed every other day (and was offered to be changed each day). The bathroom was lovely, nice bath, shower and toilet. Fresh towels provided everyday. Storage space was decent, the wardrobe had its own hangers and shelf at the top, and the safe inside that (this is a daily charge $1.50, thats automatically added provided you use it). There were 2 bedside drawers and a chest of drawers where the tv was. There were 2 tv's in the room and had so many channels including HBO, HBO 2, HBO Signature and ABC. We were able to watch pay per view films that were relatively new at the cinema for $12.99. Air conditioning was very good and easy to use and adjust, quick working and kept our room very cool. No sound could be heard from the other rooms or noises out in the hallway. The Pool: When I read the reviews about the pool I was lead to believe there was no sun and it was covered in shade all day long. This is completely untrue. If you decide to have a lazy day by the pool, then there is sun in the pool area from around 10am until 5pm. The pool does shade over during the day but only on one side and sun is still on the other side, I tended to get out by 11am and sit on the side where the sun ended up in the afternoon so that I had sun all day. This was not a problem as the pool area was so quiet, day and night. Only 3/4 people would be outside when I was. The pool is a good size and the sun heats it nice and warm. Deep end is not too deep, which is good. There is a nice jacuzzi, very hot, not good for those with sunburn! (Be warned). Breakfast and Welcome Home Snack: Each morning there is a cooked breakfast buffet from 7am until 10am. It consists of: scrambled eggs, spiced eggs, sausages, waffles or pancakes, english muffins, bread, doughnuts, cereals, coffees, teas, orange juice and other fruits. On Monday - Thursday there is a welcome home snack between 5pm-7pm. It is scheduled a month in advanced and the schedule is up on your fridge. It consists of either, mac & cheese, chilli & mac, baked potato bar, oriental chicken, chicken and rice, hot dogs, burgers and more. There is always salads, crisps and dips available. The washing laundry room only cost $1.75 a load (far cheaper than any other place we have used). The gym is fab, small but convienient and easy to use! The hotel provides a free shuttle to the universal and seaworld resorts and wet 'n' wild and aquatica. The times for universal were: 8.15am, 9am, 10am and 11.15am. Returning at: 5pm, 6.50pm, 7.50pm, 10pm, 10.45pm. The shuttle for Seaworld leaves at 9.15am. Wet 'n' Wild and Aqautica leave at 9.15am which is not always good if you need a sun shade as the sun shades are normally gone straight away when the park opens at 8am. We got a taxi to the parks on these days, if you go to reception the bellhop will put you directly into the taxi that sits out the front door and the price is about $14 to Aquatica or $9 to Wet 'n' Wild, the drivers do expect a tip (as does about everywhere!). Restaurants we enjoyed were TGI Fridays (just up from our hotel - TGI also does room service to your hotel room), Sizzlers (good for the big eaters), Ponderosa (for a huge buffet breakfast), Tony Romas (next to Ponderosa, lovely Ribs), Friendlys (good priced food and quick service, also does take out). Make sure if your not renting a car you make use of the I-Ride Trolley its a dollar a ride per person, or $5 each for 3 days unlimited or $13 dollars each for 2 weeks unlimited. It comes around every 20 minutes or sooner and is air conditioned inside. It goes all the way along international drive and stop 21 is just outside the hotel. All in all this was a fantastic hotel and we are already looking into booking again for next time. We just loved our stay and did not want to leave. I cannot give you one negative about the hotel! If you want more info then just ask! I'm sorry if you are now straining after reading this long winded review, but I find it frustrating when people give very short reviews and never explain their reasons for being negative.

How ever one of our allotted rooms turned out to be rather noisy due to being located next to an air conditioning fan. We went down the next morning to get this room changed, Within ten minutes this had been done and the members of our party were moved to another quieter room. This was the only issue we had during our two weeks stay.Overall we were very satisfied with the quality and comfort of our rooms. We used the free breakfast and lunches sometimes , they were o.k. Nice option to have We also used the free transportation povided to Disney ( this goes to Epcot from where you have to use the Disney transportation to get to the other parks). We also used the transportation to Universal, Use the 8.15 one to get to the parks early and get on the coasters with little or no wait.This was great The pool was nice , clean and a great place to relax after a day at the parks, we used this a lot, It rarely got too busy and is very shaded all day so not great for sunbathing but this suited some of our party perfectly, you can use another pool that is located across the street at their sister hotel for sunbathing if required- just ask at the front desk . We found the staff to be very good and the managers were always around if needed, they were also very friendly and chatty. We used the Taxi firm( Sterling) that is used by the hotel a few times as we had no car, Found them good , We used them to go to Boggy Creek which is located near the airport, we got our price before going and the driver waited for us until we were finished before bringing us back, we did not find this expensive as there were seven of us in our group plus not waiting for a return shuttle was great.

Apparently Florida state law says they can't wash dishes by hand. After the first day when we discovered a single glass in the dishwasher (that had only been used for drinking water!!!) we asked our maid not to wash any dishes at all until we left! What a horrendous waste of energy! Why don't they do what Travelodge in the UK do and just swap in clean glasses and mugs and do all the dirties in one or two dishwashers?

The room also featured two televisions and one bathroom. The room was clean and quiet and we did not hear anyone in the other rooms. On the downside, the one bathroom in the room was in the master suite so anyone sleeping on the sleeper sofa would have to walk through the master suites to access the bathroom. If the hotel ever did a remodel, they should consider adding another door to access it. The hotel did have a hotel and jacuzzi in the courtyard which was great for swimming, but if you intend to get a great deal of sun, think twice.

The driver said not to worry, someone else would bring us over to Disney shortly thereafter. Sure enough, a driver showed up in a mini-van a few minutes afterwards.

I was very grateful to another advisor on this site for that info as none of the front desk staff appeared to be aware of it . The shuttle to Universal/Seaworld/Aquatica worked on a seperate timetable that varied slightly week to week and did'nt have be prebooked.

If you are unfortunate enough to want to sun worship next to the shaded pool, when there are numerous more sunny places in which to sunbathe in this beautiful area then you might be disappointed. However, we found it a great place to actually swim/play in after busy days in theme parks (who needs to be next to a pool if all you want to do is sunbathe?). Our room was lovely with plenty of room for five of us, comfy beds and the sofa bed was ideal for our 13 year old. Good and cheap laundry facilities for active family in hotel. The breakfasts were ideal, plenty of choice and often replenished. There was no problem finding space in the dining room, and even if there were, you could always take a takeaway for your room. Managers Special (Mon-Thurs 5-7pm) was a real plus. As much beer, wine and soft drinks as you wanted and reasonable meals/snacks if too tired to go to a restaurant. Also, a number of local restaurants deliver to room if necessary. Hotel is located nicely for Universal and Seaworld (didn't use shuttle as had a hirecar) and only 20 mins from Disney.

Bed's are comfortable even the sofa bed wernt too bad (I actually chose to stay on it, so it cant have been that bad!), just a little too small as at only 6ft my feet were well off the bed so I feel sorry for anyone taller. Out of 19 visits to orlando, we usual go out to a restaurant usual ponderosa for an all you can eat to fill us up, but we didn't have to go out once as the breakfast was excellent, all kinds of foods hot and cold. (cereal, pancakes, sausauges/pattys, bacon, scrambled egg, boiled eggs, bread to toast, bagels, waffles, grits, donuts, muffins, orange/apple juice, coffee/tea) and during the busy summer months, it wasnt all that busy in the breakfast area.

The staff at the breakfast area does a tremendous job keeping things stocked and clean in a very heavy-use situation that could quickly turn into chaos. Our housekeeper was happily flexible in working around our erratic schedule (one parent at a conference, another spending time with the kids). The front desk staff was always available and have answered my questions and provided me with good information. The gripes about the pool-sun issue are generally accurate, but the pool itself is nicely heated, the hot tub is generously hot, and the the pool area is very a pleasant gathering place. A tip for the true sun worshipers that won't be satisfied with the enclosed situation of the Homewood pool - just a short walk across the parking lot (less than 50m) is a very open pool at the Hampton Inn, that is free to use for all Homewood guests (both hotels are owned by Hilton) - viola, problem solved.

If you're coming from Sandlake Drive (off I-4 Exit 74A), make a right onto International Drive. Follow your nose, but watch for a Bahama Breeze and TGI Fridays restaurant on the left hand side. The hotel is in the back and the entrance is between these two restaurants. Follow the road all the way to the back. I will tell you this - watch your timing when you get here as both restaurants get VERY busy and the parking lot tends to get a bit congested. Your best time is to get here between 2pm and 4pm. If your room is not ready, then just hop over to either Bahama Breeze or TGI Fridays for a drink and wait until your room is ready.

They ran you at 3 different times in the morning to most theme parks about 8.30,10.30 and 11.30 and brought you back at 6.15, 7.40 and 9.45 there is a slight change for universal and also they return later in summer months.Also they were always on time and it is usually the norm to give the drivers a tip of $1dollar per person so it works out alot cheaper than driving which costs you $10 dollars a day to park in theme parks. On the odd occasion we decided to stay after the last bus in pleasure island and city walks so we had to get a taxi back to the hotel which cost $25 from pleasure island and only $10 from city walks,both are well worth staying later for and you can get into the clubs for free by using your disney and universal flex tickets which we bought over the internet before we went we paid \u00c2\u00a3155 for disney pass and \u00c2\u00a395 for universal but they didnt include bush gardens.

Absolutely the best thing about this hotel was the \"managers happy hour\" Monday to Thursday 17:00 - 19:00, free beer or wine and some really tasty snacks in this time. It was also a great time to sit down with family who were weary from a long day at the parks to relax and discuss the many high point of the day.

As a result of not having one of these passes, every single ride that we tried to go on had a wait of at least one hour minimum. The express pass ride wait was about 10-15 minutes if that. We spoke to a family who had a pass. They went on so many rides they couldn't count them. We paid all this money to go and ended up on three rides because we were tired of waiting in the heat and humidity. You need an express pass for Universal during busy season or don't go. Now, with that being said, on to the hotel. Here's the positives: two rooms, location of hotel to restaurants (24hr Denny's right next to the parking lot for food), washer/dryer, kitchen, Universal concierge in lobby (but with limited hours). Now here's the negatives: breakfast buffet an absolute zoo, never got into the jacuzzi because absolutely packed with people and was too small, luggage carts hard to come by, the slowest elevators in history which actually broke down twice and we were on the 6th floor, hot stuffy hallway, swimming pool located between two buildings so limited sunlight, rotten set up for bathroom - bathroom with very bright flourescent light. The toilet and tub are in one room with a door. Outside of that is the sink. About three very small steps away is your king bed. (No door separating sink from bed.)I had to go to bed when my husband did because of the proximity of the sink to the bed. There is a sink in the kitchen area, but no toilet. The sink, toilet, all of that is just simply way too close to the bed. Before booking this hotel think seriously of your situation. If you come in late at night, you will be hauling a lot of luggage if no cart is available - not exactly the right way to start a \"vacation.\" We live in Los Angeles and when we come to Orlando it's usually for ten days to two weeks. There is no valet parking and no bell man. This hotel would be okay if you were just staying for one night and had very limited luggage. Other than that, I wouldn't do it again even with the incredibly low price I paid. As I said earlier, the express pass for Universal is a necessity. Add that to the price of the hotel and I would have been at the price for a Universal hotel with a bell man, valet, larger pool, etc. Too many negatives.", "Date": "April 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Russell Springs", "Title": "\u201c1 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "lwade", "ReviewID": "UR7352131", "Content": "I have stayed in many different types of hotels, my experience with this one was bad, i stayed one night on 4-11-07 had booked a 1 bedroom suite with two doubles and non smoking.

Had 15 and 17 year old niece & nephew visiting from abroad. Went for 2 bedroom [king plus 2 doubles] suite. Thanks to all prior reviewers. We weren't initially sorry - but except for a few small 'down' sides, we'll make different plans next time: Temperature control for whole place was in kids room [the one with 2 double/full size beds]. Kids like warm bedroom - we like cool. Compromise necessary, but somehow a bummer as we'd paid the same [$300] as 2 smaller rooms in a much nicer hotel [which would have had their own controls]. Kitchen area has table with 2 chairs - although there's room for 4 chairs [and for that matter: 4 people in the suite]. What were they thinking? Ice machine on ONE floor only [2nd: and by the way - do NOT book rooms 220 to 240 (approx > do some research) as I recollect they were across hallway from EXTREMELY noisy massive ice cube dump that happens when you take the sonically amplifeid tray from your fridge (no other vessels are provided in the rooms) place it inside the maw of the ice monster and push the button. Spring breakup in the arctic is quieter. Sinks are inside bedroom, while toilet & bath have their own room. Wonderful concept, badly executed. Would have been fine except for loud [and blinding] fluorescent fixture that lights up room. Advice: go to bed and wake up at same time as spouse [or sibling]. Good luck with that! Hallways may be an experiment in sensory deprivation: hot, stuffy and airless. And the 2 elevators [yes TWO for a 6 story hotel with about 48 rooms on each floor] were much worse than the hallways: if you're mildly claustrophic, don't use them. There's no air movement of any kind. I've heard that some top hotels and condos artfully employ positive and negative air pressure zones in hallways & rooms to keep cooking and other smells from travelling between rooms via the corridors. This may have been a failed attempt to do the same. Tsk-tsk. Free shuttles to theme parks are for organized people who have their kids on leashes - not for an uncle and aunt with 2 rent-a-teens. We tried the Star-something company van to Universal for 12 dollars for the 4 of us and that was fine. Came home for 8 dollars plus tip in a regular taxi. Go figger. Next day missed free shuttle and bellman called taxi which never came. We decided to drive and parked for 11 dollars in a wonderful secure multistory lot right on the Universal property. Would do that again: more flexibility after leaving park [ie. wanna go to the skydiving tower or wetnwild or somewhere non-Universal for dinner instead of the hotel? yes, please]. Some basic mathematical heads-up reminders: A. There are 2 elevators B. There are 4 luggage carts C. There are 6 floors with 48 rooms on each floor [?] Do the math. Here's our experience: On checkout day we want to spend day at the theme park so must get the heck outta hotel efficiently and either leave stuff in car in hotel lot or park at theme park [see remarks above]. We're in the southwest corner of the building, with an elevator nearby. The other elevator is in the northeast corner. Staff closes our elevator [with an \"out of order\" handmade sign on each floor]. I get a confession from desk clerk later that there is a conference on the main or 2nd floor and the attendees got tired of the \"noise\" from the guests. Hotel closes HALF the elevators [yeah, ONE of them], favoring the conventioneers over the hotel guests. Nice. What are our other options? Haul it yourself, piece by piece over about half a kilometer. Think of it this way: no one travels like Marlena Dietrich anymore, except families who stay in suite hotels. We weren't unique. Family size guests are encouraged by the suite hotels to \"move in\" - given the suggested amenities [tables, chairs, stoves, microwaves and friges] - but the available infrastructure [yes: elevators and luggage carts] is woefully lacking. Having cruised at suite level on major ships we've seen what it takes to move three thousand and more bodies and their stuff efficiently, and Homewood [Hilton, et al] haven't got a running start at covering the essentials. Take a lesson from Carnival [the most affordable of the mass market room and food providers]: get your elevators and baggage handling happening. As it was, I had to plead for an EXTRA HALF HOUR leeway to official checkout time. Give me the 4 and 5 star childless pomp and circumstance hotels [that we normally stay at] anyday over this. Next time the two nearest and dearest show up we're heading for Universal Portofino or something resembling a proper hotel, and we'll get 2 rooms and eat out [just like we did this time] Here's some more basic math [more for my own benefit right now, just typing it out]: Express Plus passes for a Thursday for 4 'adults': $80 Express Plus passes for a Friday for 4 'adults': $120 Express Plus passes for a Saturday for 4 'adults': $160 Parking at Universal: $11 Tip: Stay at one of the 3 Universal hotels and get the Express Plus [front of the line at ALL rides, etc] with the room, and no parking issues [you can take a boat from your hotel to the park]. More specifically, for the Friday of our stay, the Homewood & Express Plus passes and Parking was worth [300 room + 120 express plus + 11 universal parking] $431. Measure that against 2 rooms at one of the Universal properties. You may come out ahead. We'll definitely be back at Universal, but will never return to the Homewood Suites Orlando - International Drive.

The breakfast menu changed slightly everyday but it always included sausage, eggs, hash, waffles, cakes, toast , bagels, juices, yogurt, cereals - more than enough choice for everyone. he staff were fantatsic, so friendly. Always on hand in the mornings to help. I really loved every minute of it. the suite was spacious and cosy and the free nternet access was a real bonus. We used the fitness room just once - the day after we arrived and we were the only people in there so it was big enough. I will definitely stay there very time I go to Orlando and i cannot wait to go back.

Myself, my wife and my 1 year old son have just come back from Orlando. We booked flights but didn't have any accomodation booked. Having reseached many many web sites and confusing ourselves with the vast range of hotels we decided to book this one. And what an excellant choice we made. We spent 4 nights at the hotel and the rooms were fantastic and very clean. They just starting to renew all carpets in all rooms at the hotel this week - the old ones looked fine to me! The service was the best! We used the free transport to get to Disney, but there was some confusion over our return trip. As a result we were stranded at Disney. We phoned the hotel and they said jump in a taxi and we'll pay for the fare ($35). It transpired that the error was actually of my wife's making and she didn't book the return coach travel - never-the-less the hotel didn't argue they just wantred us back safely. After our trip we took an internal transfer to New York to spend some time with relatives. We would then come back to Orlando for 5 nights before coming back to England. I decided to save a bit of money and book a different hotel. I booked La Quinta. When we arrived back to Orlando, the taxi took us to the hotel. What an absolute disapointment. All I can say is that I checking in at 2pm and checked out at 3pm. The rooms were horrible, they were clean but not of the \"Homewood\" standard We phoned Homewood Suites and they sorted us out a room that day.

We made the perfect choice. The hotel isn't glamorous, it doesn't have a bar or a flashy reception area nor does it have a restaurant located on site. What it does have however is fantastically efficient and friendly staff, a very convenient location, oversized rooms which are kept spotlessly clean (akin to the rest of the hotel) and useful room amenities such as a full sized fridge freezer, microwave oven and dishwasher. Now I certainly don't go on holiday to cook meals in my room but the fridge was great for keeping our water, wine and beer cold and it was great to be able to heat up a mug of milk if I wanted in the evening and then put the mug in the dishwasher rather than have to wash it up! The bed is the most comfortable thing I have ever slept in and I am still struggling to re-adjust to my own bed 5 days after returning, a bed I once considered to be pretty comfortable! My husband and I are 32 and 27 respectively and don't have any children however we both felt that this would be the perfect hotel to come back to when we do have children partly due to the amount of space you have but also because of the free breakfast buffet which saved us a fortune compared to the previous year's Orlando hotel! Okay so there isn't as much choice as you'd get if you went out for your breakfast which we did a couple of times for variety but there are cereals and toast, muffins, pancakes, danish pastries waffles, sausages, eggs, tea, coffee, orange juice etc and it is FREE! On occasion we also took advantage of the free wine and beer served Monday to Thursday at the Managers reception and although we didn't eat it, the food looked pretty good and there were certainly more than a few people (most families and conferencers) who were using this as the source of their main evening meal - another great money saver for families. The only reason we didn't eat there is because our evening meal out is one of the main events of the day for us as we like a few drinks but if you had children this would be ideal after a long and tiring day at the parks! Talking of nights out! The hotel is set far enough back to be quiet and traffic noise is minimal. However it is only a two minute walk onto International Drive and within a ten minute walk from the hotel you would find Bahama Breeze, TGI Fridays, Race Rock, Charleys Steak House, The Mercado, Ponderosa and many more so there is something for every taste and budget! Howl at the Moon (great dueling piano club!) is less than five minutes from the hotel so if you want a good night out this is a great place to go! We used the hotel taxi once and paid $14 for a taxi to Universal City Walk for a night out. Coming back cost us $8 including tip so we rang Diamond Cabs or Checker Cabs for all future transport needs as they were around half the price of the Hotel Taxi! It costs around $25 - $30 to get to Downtown Disney for a night out which we didn't mind as we were on holiday with another couple but only went once as we preferred City Walk anyway! Back to the hotel, the pool was in the shade but this didn't bother us at all, (the pool was never busy often empty) - it was a welcome retreat from the sun after a day at the parks and we took full advantage of it most evenings! Would definitely stay at this hotel again and can not recommend it enough. Incidentally we booked and flew with Travel City Direct as we have done for most of our trips to Orlando. Don't hesitate to use them, we have never had a problem and they are considerably cheaper than Virgin who I didn't feel were any better in the service / comfort. Also you can upgrade to First Class or Sunshine Upper and still pay less than Virgin Economy! We flew on sunshine upper this time and it was great! No queues to check in, you get on and off first, you get a pre take off drink (bar is also free all the way too but this is standard with all flights to Orlando with Travel City) , upgraded meal service and best of all no young children screaming all the way!

The suite was great with a huge kingside bed. The pool was shaded for most of the day but we didnt go to Florida to sit round a pool. But we were told we could use the pool next door if we wanted. What made it for us was the staff. They all had badges on with WIT we asked what it meant and was told \"Whatever it takes\" and that is what they did NOTHING was too much trouble and every query was answered with a smile. All the staff spoke to us every time they passed us their manners were impeccable. Being on our own we felt really safe and comfortable in this hotel. On our return I discovered to my horror that I had left my daughters favourite teddy bear \"Stanley\" in the hotel (anyone with kids will know this sinking feeling). After lots of tears I rang the hotel and explained what had happened sure enough Stanley was still there. I asked how much it would cost to have him posted back via DHL we were quoted approx $100 I asked how much it would cost by ordinary post and left my home address.

When I booked the property was ranked #2 in the TA rankings for Orlando hotels and subsequently had slipped to #10 after some negative reviews. This concerned me a little but I shouldn't have worried as we had a fantastic time. The staff at this property are superb, extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet was excellent and even the Manager's special evening meals were acceptable (nothing too special but hey, they are free, and great when returning really tired after a day at the parks). The free wine and beer went down very well too! The suite was split into two rooms, the bedroom area with a huge King size bed and the other room with a sofa bed. There is a large TV in each room, so when we were occassionally in the room there was no arguing with the kids over what to watch. There is a huge fridge in the room, perfect for stocking up on a variety of drinks from the Walgreen's around the corner. The only real negative is the pool which has restricted sun during the day as overshadowed by the property, but some days even this was a blessing due to the exceptional heat! The previous review to mine has mentioned the decor being a bit drab and I suppose this is also a reasonable criticism, but I certainly didn't go to Orlando to look at the interior of the hotel! Anyway, whilst we were there, they had started the process of replacing the carpets in rooms on the ground floor, never saw the results though. Summing up, an excellent location, clean property/rooms, good value with friendly/helpful staff. I can only imagine the negative reviews are from people with extremely high standards expecting 5 star quality just because this property is towards the top of the TA ratings.

I would agree with most of the positive comments about this hotel and we enjoyed our stay. The hotel has a good location between I-Drive and Universal Way. We used Universal Way a lot to avoid the busy I-Drive section around Sandlake Road. Checking in and out took no time at all and the suite we had was adequate for our needs. All staff we encountered were polite and helpful. Our suite was on floor 3 and looked out on to the central courtyard containing the pool. This did make the room a bit dark and dingy at times, but nothing to complain about. We couldnt detect any noise from the pool when it was busy. We had a few minor problems with the room upon our arrival, but these were fixed promptly by maintenance and the general standard of decor and cleanliness were fine throughout. The main bed was a king-size and was very comfortable. The sofa bed which our daughter slept on had seen better days, but did the job. Like others, we found the breakfast offered to be excellent, with plenty of choice. With the exception of the pasta night, we did not enjoy the evening snacks and tended to eat out a fair bit - they aren't advertised as main meals and they are complimentary, so who's complaining! The free beer was great! The swimming pool and hot tub were good - we used them everyday, although it is only completely open to the sun during the middle part of the day. We quite liked the shade as the temp was up in the 90s. However on the less humid days when the wind was up a bit, it was noticeably chilly. There were plenty of towels. The few negatives I would note were: the noise from the combined air-con units. Even with our unit switched off overnight, the constant hum rebounding in the courtyard from other rooms and the big fan units, which I assume cool the corridors, was initially disturbing, but we got used to it after a few nights. the counter-tops in the kitchen and bathroom were being upgraded whilst we were there and we had a note passed under our door saying that the work would be done whilst we were out. As we were within 2 nights of leaving and would be spending more time in the room, we opted to decline this (as offered on the note). However, we came back during the afternoon to find the work was being done anyway - during the last couple of days, the sink started to leak, resulting in maintenance men coming in and out to fix it.

I really feel TA should categorize the hotels differently maybe by price or stars as this hotel is ok for a \"chain\" hotel but comes no where close to the Portofino Bay or the Grand Floridian and I am sure many other \"luxury hotels\". The suite is very small ok for 1 or two people. The furniture was worn and tattered. The bed was fine but nothing special. The carpet was soiled. My door lock was broken which I realized when I returned after a short trip on I-Drive to find the door unlocked even though it closed behind me. Then one of the windows would not close all the way with no screen but the wonderful maintenance men fixed that. They gave me a free movie and popcorn. Big deal! My next hotel actually gave me a free night for their inconveniences. The a/c in the room was ok but in the lobby and hallways was barely on. The pool was beyond horrible. I felt I was on the Spiderman ride looking up at concrete buildings. One person could carefully walk on each side around loungers and the sun only appeared for 3.5 hours during the hottest time of the day. They have a hot tub but I saw one couple in it for hours! If you have children or a large group the free buffets were fine especially for kids so you could save alot of money.

We paid $119 a night.We had spent the previous week at the Homewood Suites in Lake Beuna which were excellent and only $79 a night. We had only chosen two different locations to cut down on travelling and the fact the most hotels in LBV didn't offer shuttle services to Universal. Firstly, the appearence of the hotel and the rooms were excellent. The breakfast was great if not a little crowded. However you could take food back to your room and keep going back for more. The Managers reception from Monday to Thursday was also very good and again you were able to take beer, wine, soft drinks and food back to your room if you wanted. We used the shuttle service to the parks every day and they were always there on time. It would have been great if there had been a late afternoon shuttle to the parks so you could have just gone for the night parades and fireworks. The pool was nice but no childrens pool which means you really have to be in there with young children. It was nice that you were in the shade as you don't have to worry about sun block all the time. The only downside of the hotel (and the reason I haven't given it 5 stars) is that it had the noisiest air conditioning I have ever heard. The first night we were there we turned our air conditioning off because it was so loud. However, it didn't seem to make any difference so we thought there was a problem. We called maintenance who arrived very promptly. They said the noise was from other peoples air conditioning because there was one channel that went from the top of the building to the bottom. Also the air condition units were mounted on the outside by the windows. Our room was literally vibrating. The maintenance man said it was a common complaint, so I was very surprised never to have read anyone else mention it on the reviews. He found us a room on the ground floor on the corner next to a store cupboard. He said it would be the quietest room he had and it was fine. We were moved that night and allowed to leave our stuff in our old room overnight and collect in the morning. There is no way I would have been able to spend a week in the old room. The noise would have driven me crazy. I guess if you are use to air conditioning then you probably wouldn't notice it so much. We hadn't had this problem the previous week. When you turned the aircon off there, it was completely silent. The location of the hotel is good. Lots of restaurants in walking distance. There is an I Ride Trolly stop five minutes from the hotel. All in all a lovely hotel but I don't think I would risk staying there again incase I ended up with a noisy room.

How wrong I was. I have been to Florida twice and can honestly say this is the worst hotel I have stayed in. We arrived on a Saturday and drove to the hotel. We got at front desk and was greeted by an ignorant women. When my husband politely said \"hello\" we just got a grunted reply of \"name\". When we booked, we requested a non smoking room. She told us that the room was a smoking room, and when we told her that we booked a non smoking room, she replied \"not my problem, ask your rep\"!! We thought this was very rude. So without an argument, we trudged up to our suite through a damp smelling corridor which was filled with bins full of rubbish. We discovered that the room 2 doors down were playing loud music. This was at 11:15!! We entered our suite to be greeted with damp smells, dirty carpets, unmade beds, unemptied bins, thread bare curtains hanging of the rail and when closed they had huge holes in them. The bathroom wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much better. Mould on the tiles, broken shower head that was no more than a drizzle, leaking toilet, and the mirror was missing. We turned on the air conditioning to find it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. But because it was so late we decided to wait till the morning till we informed the front desk. We went to be at about 12am. It had been 20 minutes and the loud music was still playing. In the end my husband called front desk to tell them. It was the same woman as before and she just said the hotel policy was that music can be played until 01:30 hours at the weekends!! We told her we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep and she said there was nothing she could do about it and hung up on us!! We were kept awake till 1:45am and called front desk again and told her that the time limit was up and asked for someone to come up and tell them to turn the music down. She said she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as the hotel security was on vacation and that she or other members of staff couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t because it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hotel policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It seemed she liked saying that. We eventually got to sleep but were woken by someone banging on our door at 6:30am. It was a maid wanting to clean our room!! I said we are still in bed and she practically ordered us to be out the room by 7:30!!! We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe the attitude. We decided to go to Magic Kingdom and take advantage of the free Disney transport. We went to front desk and, yes you guessed it, greeted by the same receptionist as before. We asked for the free coach and she informed us that the free shuttle was only available on certain days and that today we would have to pay!! We were disgusted. It is what I would call false advertisement. So off we went to the theme park and before we left we asked for maintenance to fix the leaky toilet and the air conditioner. We got back and found the toilet NOT fixed and neither had the air conditioner!! Again called front desk who told us maintenance only worked nine till six!! We also discovered the room HADN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122T been cleaned by the maid who had made us exit our room to clean it. So at this point we were getting annoyed. We have: Ignorant staff, dirty rooms, loud music, woken up by the maids, poor service and basically being ripped off. The next incident took place 5 days later. We got back from the theme park to discover a watch of my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had gone missing. We reported it to front desk who said in so many words nothing could be done and blamed us by saying we had mislaid it!! We decided to move hotels but were told we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t by our rep. We put up with this dire place for the rest of the holiday. During this time rooms were not cleaned well or simply not cleaned at all, the broken electrical things were never fixed or replaced, loud music and noise went on till all hours with nothing being done. And to add insult to injury on the last day, we went to get our deposit back and were told we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have it because of the maintenance work that had been done on our room!!!! Not only had NO work been done but should WE pay for that anyway??!!?! We were disgusted with this hotel and would advise people to avoid. Pick the Embassey Suites or The Quality Inn Plaza Suites.

The suites have kitchenettes which were useful as well. -- Best free breakfast I've been to. We get around quite often and this morning breakfast was the best. Well stocked, plentiful, and good. -- Staff ... really considerate. Everyone said hello, good morning, and went out of their way to be helpful. -- Extremely good location. Talk about centrally located, it doesn't get any better than this place. NEGATIVES: -- The elevators were extremely slow.

The hotel is very clean and comfortable and relatively new (maybe 3 years old). The rooms have separate living areas. Check in was great, and the staff was very helpful. The only reason I am not giving this hotel an excellent, it that when i asked for a metered cab.. they gave me a limo/towncare company with set rates...no meter! And when I took the same ride with a metered cab it was almost half the difference. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone going to the Convention Center Area. I got a great rate on this hotel on Priceline for $65/night. I would say the same for Disney travelers, except I would advise to rent a car.

I have not been disappointed, the Homewood was excellent especially as it was not an expensive hotel, amongst the cheapest options in the travel brochure we chose from. Free breakfast was great, wide range of choices, we did not have any problems with the plastic cutlery and paper plates, they were quite sturdy, not the really flimsy ones. There is a safe in the wardrobe and there are decent hairdryers which I had wondered about myself beforehand. Proper iron and board also. In fact the only addition I would have liked (and would never expect anyway in an American hotel) is a kettle, as I like my cuppa:-) I just used microwave to boil water for tea. We did not use the pool, but as others said it is in the shady courtyard, it looked nice though (also the jacuzzi), our room overlooked pool area. We did not go to the evening buffet either as we were never there around that time. A great selection of recommended restaurants within a few minutes walk, Race Rock and Olive Garden were our favourites. 24 hr Walgreens also within 5 min walk. An easy quiet drive to Disney straight down I Drive turn right onto 536 and straight into Disney, about 8 miles but not complicated. We used rental car not shuttles, plenty of parking. Would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone. Comfy bed, plenty of room, big fridge freezer and microwave. Great housekeeper (thank you Cielo) friendly staff.

We also enjoyed the managers reception for ten minutes on thursday evening as we arrived (it ends at 7 p.m.). We ended up skipping the dinner for evening. So for being free it was really great. The shuttle to Sea World only went once or twice a day and it comes back only once at evening time. Not very flexible for our family with two little kids. We used rental car.
