The ONLY reason I did not give the hotel 5 points, is because 1.) we stayed in room 34 with 3 persons, and the sofa sleeper mattress was so thin it was like sleeping on the springs. We called for a roll away, which Phillipe promptly delivered, and that seemed to be a better sleep. For the price of the room, you would anticipate better sleeping accommodations for the third person. 2) There was a heavy smoker somewhere in the hotel, and the smoke FILLED our room. I would suggest that if the smoke travels through the hotel like that, that it become non smoking in all rooms. We had to purchase a candle and light t with the windows open to air out the room. The staff at this hotel is PHENOMENAL. There isn't anything that they can't and won't do to make your stay as pleasant as possible. They arranged a wonderful trip to the Loire Valley for us, and made our dinner reservations. They even stored our bags for us when we landed on a layover in Paris so we could enjoy the city before our flight. We weren't staying in the hotel until 3 days later, and yet they were completely agreeable to helping us.

The balcony did not face the street to have a great view but it was still nice to sit outside and have a glass of wine or lunch when it was nice out. The location was superb and we walked everywhere. The only time we took a metro (station is around the corner) was to Montmartre and took a taxi back. We had two dinners at the restaurant and it was one of the most memorable meals we ever had. I recommend to book a table on the weekend (pre fix menu, white table cloth, and very good and polite waiters) when chef Yves Camdeborde does his magic. If you're a foodie its a must. Also, people wait for several months to get in unless you're a guest at the hotel, you are in luck! I did select the hotel because of the restaurant but was very happy with the selection at last. The beds were very comfortable, housekeeping excellent. Loved relaxing after dinner at the lounge area, they have Delicious mint water, so needed at the end of the day. One of the most amazing thing about this hotel is BREAKFAST! It is so good and so French! You can tell the chef owns the place. A lot of attention is paid to the quality and presentation. The croissants, the jambon, the cafe o lait, the yogurts, the breads, the honey, the jam, the butter. Claudine, the wife of chef Camdeborde runs the hotel and is the most wonderful host.

Our usual hotel was fully booked - I relied on the internet and Tripadvisor to make an eight night booking at Relais St Germain. I am reluctant to enthuse too much in case there will never be room for us when we wish to return. Location is incredibly convenient - busses, choice of metro, walking. Staff could not have been more helpful in every way (more later). We had a suite on 5th floor - decor what you would be happy to have at home, comfy beds, no sense of crowding, three large windows on to the carrefour. Whilst we were there the lovely geraniums in our window boxes were changed for beautiful purple boxes. Bathroom small but with full shower and bath. Although on the square (which is busy with traffic and the queue for the restaurant) our room was quiet - there is double glazing but we slept with windows open (it was a warm November).An added extra was the saxophone each evening at about ten. On arrival - Marie (marvellous housekeeper) organised tickets for us at the Luxembourg, was always chatty and gave us a marvellous tour of the entire hotel so that we could choose our rooms for next time (not one room was not pleasantly or charmingly decorated, comfortable and spacious). Three receptionists - all helpful and kindly - making restaurant reservations and so on. Downstairs a very nice little lounge (lots of guide books) and wifi throughout. Breakfast was a great start to the day - Christofff was our host each morning - he worked like a trojan to produce a delightful selection and added much personality. The restaurant was a highlight - we dined in the week on the gourmet menu, we dinnered off a la carte over the weekend, we lunched. We are larger as a result. There was not one selection we did not enjoy. I recommend the haddock mousse with herring caviar. It is incredibly busy yet service is excellent and the food was exceptional - and we eat Michelin star during our time in France. The hotel is not cheap - yet I thought it was excellent value and, compared to other hotels in which we have stayed, we had more space and far nicer decor that anywhere comparable in price.

The bedroom area was separated from the lounge area by some structural pillars. The bed was comfortable and the bedding was beautiful. The bathroom was of a good size with a separate bath and shower. The cupboards were in a separate dressing room off the lounge area which provided plenty of storage.

The continental breakfast was varied and of great quality. There was juice, tea, coffee, fruit, yoghurt, croissant, baguette, rye bread, boiled egg, ham, cheese, butter and jam on offer.

This is a small four star located just south of the river, ten minute walk to Notre-Dame, twenty minute walk to the Louvre Museum and with other important sites at walking distance. The Metro Odeon station is just outside the hotel. The hotel has only twenty rooms,is extremely well looked after by the owners who also own and run the bistro-restaurant next door L'Comptoir which is considered one of the best in Paris The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The room was a very nice surprise as it was much larger than what I expected and it was decorated in a twenty, thirties style with lots of antiques. The queen size best was one of the most comfortables I have ever had in a hotel (having stayed in others such as the Ritz, The Dorchester and The Berkeley in London, the Arts in Barcelona, etc). The room have a lovely view of the street with its bistros and although it was busy it was never disturbing. It had a good size bathroom with a separate toilet and certainly it was spotless as the rest of the room and the hotel. Breakfast was included in the price of 209 euros per night. This was another wonderful surprise as this was served at the bistro by an extremely kind, gentle and professional french waiter. Breakfast was served individualy and included some of the best croissants I ever had in my live, orange juice, beautiful coffee, a perfectly boiled egg, gammon, cheese, yoghourt, fruit...all these brought to you to the table by our waiter. I ate most of the evenings at the restaurant where the owner is the main chef. The quality of the products were outstanding. Most dishes where French based with perhaps a touch of Spanish influence. Every evening there was a large queue of people having to wait a long time to get a table. Clientele was mixed but certainly there were many locals. The staff were fantastic, very well organised and extremely helpful with always a smile in their face. The evening lady manager was a real character and as I ate there three evenings she made me feel like a very welcomed regular customer. One of the advantages of staying at the hotel was that I did not have to queue to get a table at the restaurant....which I really appreciate after a day of ten hours of lectures in Cardiology and after having to travel every day for two hours to and back the conference centre. I tried the scargots, the lobster bisque, a sirloin steak done in red wine sauce (one of the best steaks I have ever had.....!!!), and many other dishes could not fault any....the cuisine is excepcional. The desserts were also beautiful. One night I tried the \"Rum Baba\" and having had the same a the \"Alain Ducasse Restaurant at the Dorchester in London I thought that the one at L'Comptoir was even better. The wine list is french, well priced and with a very good range of wines. In summary the hotel is one of the best one I have ever stayed in with the bonus of having one of the best bistro in Paris. I will certainly highly recommend it and I am looking forward to return one day in the near future. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all hotel and restaurant staff for their hard work and professionalism.

This was our first stay at Hotel Relais Saint-Germaine, and we would not consider staying anywhere else in Paris. It is in a fantastic position, literally 10 seconds from Odeon metro, and the Boulevard Saint-Germaine. The Louvre area and the Seine are a lovely 10-15 stroll through side streets with wonderful shops. We walked everywhere from the hotel, except the Eiffel Tower, and that was an easy metro ride away. What makes this hotel so wonderful is the attention to detail, and the hospitality they extend. All our enquiry emails were answered extremely promptly, even though it was often the middle of the night Paris time when i sent them! On arrival we were greeted with charm and offered fresh mint or lemon water from the jugs in reception that are constantly replenished. Our rooms were absolutely fabulous. It's a small and stylish hotel,t the rooms were incredibly spacious, beautifully decorated ( even better than they look in the photos) and very clean. We had a huge room(for Paris!) on the 5th floor and not being a fan of tiny lifts i did use the spiral staircase, but it was fine. We had a seperate shower in the room, which we enjoy. Our 3 teenage children had an enormous room on the 3rd floor, complete with a fishbowl and a fighting fish. They had a seperate toilet in their room as well which was great for 3 people trying to share one bathroom. The third bed in their room was a sofa bed, and everyday it was put away and remade up at night, a fantastic touch. Beautiful window boxes outside the windows, and at night, as we sleep with our windows open, the sounds of the accordionist and a saxophonist in the square below made it a truely Parisian experience. Breakfast was very good, and we ate at Le Comptoir for one evening meal and it was superb. Starbucks is just around the corner for those who wish to sometimes have a home comfort!, and an amazing couple of crepe and sandwich shops are 50m from the door, for an easy lunch or snack. This hotel has a very personal touch, we were given free tickets on a Seine Boat tour, and they scourced out for us a resturaunt we had visited on a previous trip to Paris and couldnt remember the name of (Relais Entreconte...go there for an amazing steak and pomme frite experience). We also mentioned to them we had a 7am train to catch and came down the next morning to find a taxi pre-ordered and waiting for us...absolutely incredible. Lastly, i emailled them 2 weeks after leaving about a shop we were trying to contact. I could only give them a vague description, but one of the staff went for a walk, found the shop and emailled me back all the details.

The hotel made and adjusted various restaurant reservations and called us a cab for the hotel. I believe that the driver is someone that they regularly use. There was one front desk employee (female, older, dark hair) who was not very helpful when it came to getting the lobby computer to work, but the head housekeeper helped and she was lovely. The owner, Yves Camdeborde, also tried to help with the computer, but even he had a hard time. Speaking of the owner, who is also the chef of Le Comptoir, his food is wonderful. One of the main benefits of staying at the hotel is being guaranteed a reservation for dinner. If you stay at this hotel, so not miss the restaurant. Breakfast is part of the hotel stay, and is also very good. It includes coffee or tea, juice, croissants, bread, yogurt, soft boiled egg, spanish ham, and fruit.

The positives first....the location is outstanding. This part of the 6th, a stones throw from the Seine, L'Odeon Metro stop, shops restaurants and quintessential Paris life was spectacular. The breakfast included with the stay was incredible - bowls of cafe au lait, eggs, ham, cheese croissant at Le Comptoir St. Germain right next door. Awesome. But the negatives...they very quickly overtook the positives and turned the stay into a very frustrating and even dangerous one. First there are no dedicated non smoking rooms, so if you have trouble with residual smoke in the air, this place is not for you. The room was small which was fine, but the brown shag carpet was quite dirty and the bed was uncomfortable. We would have overlooked that, because we really didn't spend much time in the room. But twice when we left the room and locked the door (they use actual keys, not key cards) we returned to find the door unlocked. Wide open. The first time it happened we expressed concern and were apologized to. The second time it happened, we got the French shrug. No apology. No concern. They really didn't care. As two women travelling alone, it was unacceptable. We also had problems with the front desk refusing to call restaurants to make reservations, calling a cab for us and not letting us know it had arrived (so the meter was already at 10 euros when we go to the cab!), and generally not being helpful. At all. While I know service in France is much more laissez faire than in North America, for 300 Euro's a night, this place took it too far.

Its location is absolutely brilliant, right in the heart of the buzz of the Rive Gauche, at an intersection dotted with cafes, bistros, meandering lanes where you would discover the quaintest shops and patisseries (highly recommended - MULOT - just a 3 min walk from the hotel). Bonus - very efficient wi-fi connectivity that helped us keep in touch with the world. Our family of 4 (one adult child, and one teenager) stayed in the Marcel Proust (room #32), and the Ernest Hemmingway (room #22) rooms - amazing decor and lavishly comfortable. We landed in the midst of an unprecedented heat-wave in Paris (over 32 degrees Celsius), and were grateful for the super-efficient air-conditioning! The team at the Relais - at least those we met - is excellent - namely Stana, Philippe, Anna. Plus the super-efficient bistro gentleman who served us breakfast every morning (except our final morning) at the Le Comptoir cafe. The first day we arrived - we had a late lunch there, and met him for the first time. When asked what's good - he said \"everything is bad\" ... ahhh ... a brilliant introduction to the French sense of humour! On meals - our first lunch at the Le Comptoir was great - we over-ordered (compared to the modest croque monseiurs that other tables were having) - our order included an onglet of beef, two beef chateubriands, a platter of assorted charcuterie etc! We went on to a few hits and misses for our meals in Paris over the 4 nights we were there. HIGHLY recommended is the CHEZ L'AMI JEAN at Rue Malar (within 15 mins walking from the Eiffel Tower) - brilliant x 3! The chef there is Stephane Jego, and he used to work with Yves Camdabord of Le Comptoir. If you want something different to the usual bistro fare - go there - novel Basque combinations in a traditional bistro setting! A major MISS - the Relais L'Entrecote (at Rue St Benoit) - purportedly a 50-year (or more) restaurant that serves only ONE dish - beef entrecote, with what others claim to be an amazing 'secret sauce' - sorry we were extremely DISAPPOINTED. Beef was stringy and powdery, and for the price, we would have fared much better elsewhere.

The antiques turned out to be oversized and decrepit old junk. The door was hanging off the wardrobe. The ancient bed was too big for the room and left a small gap of 12 inches each side for us to move in. The bathroom was so tiny, you could touch all walls without stretching. Worst of all, the room opened directly on to a spiral staircase - very dangerous - and getting suitcases in and out was a nightmare. No one helped. No public rooms and reception often unmanned. If you make a reservation, make sure you know exactly what quality of room you are getting as the rooms vary enormously but the prices do not. We were ripped off.", "Date": "March 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire", "Title": "\u201cReservation, what reservation?\u201d", "Author": "SophisticatCheshire", "ReviewID": "UR10106065", "Content": "My hubbie booked some flights for Paris, leaving me to find some accomodation. No mean feat, given the semi-finals of the World Cup Rugby were on that weekend. Anyway, as I used to live in the locality I was very pleased with myself when I managed to secure the last room at what I remembered to be a good value for money, clean hotel. I made sure that the hotel confirmed the reservation in writing as I couldn't quite believe they were the only hotel in the area to have a vacancy. Upon arriving at the hotel at 20.00, the receptionist told us that they had given our room away. He said they had emailed us at 17.34 to tell us our card hadn't gone through. We were now stranded on what was one of the busiest weekends of the year with nowhere to stay. I explained that the card details had been given a week earlier and surely if there was a problem they should have contacted me by phone or email at that point, not by email when we were already on the flight to Paris! They agreed they should have done but didn't offer any apology or anything. We stayed in a flea pit that night and didn't sleep a wink and then managed to book one night at the Hotel le Crillon at 800 euros for the night! When we arrived home I checked my email and it made no mention of a card payment not going through. All they said was that if we were arriving late that evening, they couldn't guarantee being able to hold the room! The management of this hotel are liars and they didn't even have the decency to apologise for ruining what should have been a fantastic and romantic weekend in Paris. Don't touch this place with a barge pole.", "Date": "October 18, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Relais Saint-Germain", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d194309-Reviews-Hotel_Relais_Saint_Germain-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$380 - $577*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">9, Carrefour de l'Odeon</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75006</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514897", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/c3/4c/c34cab4a6560070e210f8f616af97e1a7large.jpg"}}
