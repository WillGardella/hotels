It was as if he expected me to be unhappy with the place. I am a middle-aged lady, had two pretty large suitcases covering two months of travel and the young male receptionist would not help me with my bags. He said he couldn't leave his post, but there was a lift. However, the lift was up one flight of stairs, so I had to drag my suitcases up, one at a time. The elevator was so tiny that I couldn't fit both suitcases and myself in the lift at the same time, so I had to leave one suitcase unwatched on the second level, go up to my room with one suitcase, then back down to get the next suitcase. As I got out of the elevator to pick up the second bag, all of the lights went out in the stair well. I called down the stairs to the receptionist for help, and he said the lights were on a timer on the lower level, but he wouldn't turn them on for me. It was sort of comical, but awful service. I spent about 15 minutes in the room- one towel, no place to put my suitcases. Just depressing. I went downstairs to talk to him about towels and the lousy welcome, and he had been replaced by a girl who said she didn't speak English. I told her I was leaving and the place was unacceptable, and she said \"You have to pay- you used the room\". We argued in my limited French and I finally made the opposite trip with the bags. I called and wrote several times after my return home, but they would not deal with me, and did charge my credit card. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money.

Whoever wrote the reviews about small rooms has apparently never stayed in a traditional Paris hotel before. Lots of character in this hotel. A winding staircase around a very small elevator. Clean, small, rooms ... we felt they were soundproof at night. No trouble sleeping at all. Comfortable beds, helpful and friendly staff, great French breakfasts. I can't wait to come back. It's my new home away from home in Paris.", "Date": "November 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cStay somewhere else!\u201d", "Author": "DrDLondon", "ReviewID": "UR8267913", "Content": "We'd booked two nights and our reception was welcoming and friendly.

The room was terrible - I was there with a friend so we had requested a room with 2 beds. We got 2 beds, but one was just a cot! I got the cot, and my back was aching after the first night. As for the tiny bathroom, the had attached a bidet to the side of the tub, so you had to step over or in it to get into the tub! Very bizzare. The carpeting was filthy, and you had to climb a very rickety staircase to get to the room, or take your chances on the the one-person elevator. The breakfast area was dark and dingy. However the most depressing aspect of this hotel was the fact that the owners keep 2 turtles in a pail in the reception area - the pail is empty except for a couple inches of water and one brick. It was so horrible coming in every day and seeing the turtles trying desperately to get out of this terribly bleak captivity. We complained to the front desk staff and they agreed that it was awful, but said the owners wouldn't do anything about it. They told us that one lovely American guest had felt so bad that he had taken the turtles for a whole day to a nearby park, so they could walk on the grass and feel the sunshine. We tried contacting the owners after our stay and offered to take the turtles to an animal sanctuary outside of Paris, but they never responded.

Anyway, the apartment was HUGE...almost as much sqaure footage as my house in Atlanta. Very large bedroom and living room, plus a kitchen, and a loft with some extra sleeping space (more suited for kids, but could accomodate adults as well). The whole thing looked out onto a really picturesque courtyard and was very private.

In the meantime, I read a Trip Advisor review by another prospective guest who experienced the same thing as I did. Apparently the hotel has ignored other guests' cancellation emails and proceeded to charge their cards citing that they did not cancel properly via fax. But there is no specification in the hotel's emails saying that to cancel one must send a fax. It says to cancel in writing only and to that I assume that includes emails.
