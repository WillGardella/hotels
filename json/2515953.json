I stayed in the Bay Bridge Mandarin room which was exceptional! Now the stay after New Years 2011 I booked the cheapest room they had for 2 nights under the California resident rate and just joking around I asked for an upgrade on their Facebook Fan Page. When I walked up to the counter the lady took my name and immediately said 'Welcome Back' and informed me that they were able to upgrade me to the Dynasty Suite for the 2 nights. Listen folks, the fact is I am a truck driver and I wouldn't be able to afford 2 nights on a weekend in a Suite at the Mandarin if I tried saving for a year..

Like any hotel with an Asian heritage, service is outstanding. Truly. And the views, as others have said, are amazing. The big place where the hotel falls down and is no better than, in my opinion a Holiday Inn or Motel 6, is outlets. If you are a business person and you want to sit at the desk, no outlets. You will crawl under the desk to see one outlet only with the other one taken up by the lamp. This makes a material difference if you are using a MIFI device, charging your phone, and banging away at the laptop. It's really bad. There is a 4 plug (you get 3) on the left side of the bed behind the night stand which you have to move to get to them. If you are the lay in bed with the laptop person, phone on night stand, okay, you'll be okay. The hotel could easily solve this with a power strip in the room up on the desk. Internet is expensive just because they can. So, I nail em with average because the plug situation is poor for a business, high end hotel but also because when I called for a power bar, nobody could get me one.

We noticed personal welcome letters to another guest and even a monogrammed pillow.

No porter was made available to move our luggage and the promised complimentary coffee never appeared. We had to call twice to get it delivered.

This is the fourth MO property that we stayed at, and the first that left us disappointed. We stayed at the MO SF for four nights last summer. The hotel is different to other MO's in that the lobby and reception are at street level. It is somehow very small and unimpressive. You can literally walk past the hotel and not even notice it. The rooms are located at the top of the twin towers and offer great views of the city and SF Bay. Our room had a bit of an awkward shape, being long and crooked. The bathroom was rather small, and the water pressure was weak. The room service was excellent but very pricey. All in all I believe there are better hotels in SF if you are coming to visit the city for a few days. Given the fact the the SF MO does not even have a SPA facility, there is not really a big reason to stay at the MO.

Lets forget the view, there isnt a bad view in San Francisco. The hotel is jaded-dated and really feels that it should have had a makeover in the last 10 years. Check in was standard. I had a corner room on the 38th floor and was not impressed by the dated decor and furnishings. I ordered room service for two and for pre-prepared food it took a long time to arrive, and with a very limited late night menu, no french fries etc. The grilled cheese sandwich was foccacia with feta spread, disgusting and inedible and my chicken sandwich a close second. A call to complain to the front desk was met with \"thats how the chef choses to prepare the dishes'. What chef??? Clearly there is none in the building overnight and frankly in a hotel of this reported caliber I expect a lot more and a better response from the front desk. The bed was ok, the thread count and pillow number a far cry from other MO's and the bathroom towels getting on the thin and grey side. In fact, nothing exuded a sense of luxury. The next morning the elevator was out of service and I was stuck on the 38th floor until after a number of calls to the operator (handled poorly) it began operating again. Asking the doorman for the nearest drugstore resulted in me being sent on a 6 block hike, although I subsequently find one just around the next corner. The front desk did not know where there was a good late night deli or restaurant and thats how things just continued to go. A burger and fries in the lounge bar area took an age to arrive mid-afternoon and just ok, and for which they comped us a couple of drinks.

There were a lot of nice touches in the room-- a smal fruit platter, fresh flowers, personalized stationary... but the view-- WOW. The windows open a little so you can get fresh air. We could see alcatraz and the bridges from our room. Really nice.... which brings me to the room. I hate to say this, but the room itself was dissapointing. The furniture was old and outdated. There were 2 TVs in the suite, and they were both fuzzy in reception. There was not much of a channel selection. There are also 2 bathrooms in the suite, which was nice. The showers were really old with some unattractive tiles (reminded me a little bit of a locker room shower). The bathtubs were also small. The bed was super comfortable, though-- and great quality bedding. I used the gym one evening, and it was great. A huge variety of updated machines with a TV on each machine, water bottles and towels were also available. While the view and service were unparalleled, the room furnishings were too dated.

We chose the Mandarin Oriental among others because we enjoy secluded luxury when my wife and I travel, and that is exactly what you get at this hotel. Here are some thoughts on the property.. Location: The Mandarin Oriental is located in the middle of downtown San Francisco, within walking distance to every major attraction, though if you have been to San Fran, you know that walking is not preferred with all of the hills. The hotel is actually part of a larger office tower, and just occupies the top floors. The tower is right across from the TransAmerica building. The only downside to the location is that it is not right in the middle of the hotel / tourist district, so taxis are not necessarily prevelant, though the staff does a nice job of calling them in advance. Accomodations: We booked a bay view room, but were upgraded to the \"Bridge to Bridge\" room, which is a corner room that overlooks both the Golden Gate and Bay bridges, TransAmerica tower, Alcatraz and Coit Tower. We have stayed in a lot of neat places, but it will be hard to beat that view. Since you are on about the 50th (?) floor, the views are unbelievable, and we just kept our windows open all the time. The room is spacious and well designed, but not that large. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom had both a tub and shower, which was nice. Did I mention the view? Property: As I mentioned, the hotel is on the top floors of an office tower, so it is a little interesting. The lobby to the hotel is a separate entrance and is somewhat quaint. They have a restaurant there, but we did not eat at it. The hotel is very quiet and you can tell most people staying there are successful businessmen or well-traveled couples. Not really a party crowd, if thats what you are looking for.. perfect for us. The lobby provides an unlimited selection of DVDs that you can watch for free in your room. We also ordered room service one night, and breakfast one morning and the food was very, very good. All of the staff are very professional and knowledgeable about getting around the city - even provided us with a complimentary umbrella to use.

There is a fast wired connection but you have to pay about $15 to $12 a day for it -- this struck me as nickel and diming. The room is serviced twice a day so you have fresh towels whenever you like. We did not eat lunch or dinner at the hotel -- there are superb restaurants just around the corner that we wished to try (Michael Mina, for instance).

Look for the state resident weekend promotion, which nicely includes the valet parking. Is it the newest hotel in SF? No. While the room furnishings have been very nicely updated, with very comfortable new beds, there's certainly no hiding that the building dates back to the late 1980s. Is it a \"be-seen\" venue? Nope. The lobby and the public spaces have a decidedly residential feel, and the relatively small room count adds to that. But this place absolutely wins over them all with the warm, genuinely friendly, unchanging staff (they recognized us after the second visit); understated, comfortable elegance; and the unbeatable views, on which much praise has already been heaped. As an area resident, it was a real treat to enjoy a portrait of San Francisco -- the changing lights, rolling fog and all -- from this perspective. It gave me a renewed appreciation for the beautiful city that it is. On the subject of views, I too would recommend the Bridge-to-Bridge view rooms. Previously we had also stayed in the Golden Gate Mandarin rooms, and didn't find it such a great idea for a couple of reasons: (1) One of the windows facing the Golden Gate is located in the bathroom, over the tub. Which would otherwise make for a nice brochure shot, but really, how much time can you spend in the bathtub? (2) There is also a permanently-lowered sheer shade on that bathroom window, presumably to spare the view of your buttocks from the area office windows. And a nice bonus: The windows open ever so slightly for ventilation. The fresh air is nice up there.

However be aware that this hotel is out of the way if you want to be a tourist and check out the wharf like we did. We made the mistake of strolling around and then trying to catch a cab in that area of town, basically there weren't any. We had to walk all the way back and wait for a cab to come to the hotel (it's not like NYC where they are all over the place that's for sure). I did have a strange occurrence though. The hotel town car gave me a ride back from the wharf one night and I dropped my wallet in the car. The car came right back after dropping off another couple from the hotel to a club and the wallet was gone. I told security that the wallet was in the car and if he found the couple (who were obviously staying at the hotel), most likely he would find my wallet since the driver said he didn't see it. Sure enough, security got it for me the next morning - minus all my cash. My stupid move for leaving the wallet, however you always wonder what actually went down with the cash.

Unfortunately we were very disappointed. At check in there was some confusion about the booking with one of two rooms booking being lost. The receptionist was slightly flustered and eventually blamed our agent (Amex platinum service) for the error. Luckily we had a printout of the confimation and she eventually found the \"lost\" booking on the computer. In addition the scheme that we had booked offered an upgrade if available - I had to specifically ask for this and at first she denied we were eligible for this but then in view of the delays and lost booking one room was upgraded to a higher floor. During the whole process the receptionist made me feel that the fault was mine! Then she forgot to swipe my credit card and I received a phone call at 9:30pm requesting that either I come down or that the card be collected from the room and swiped. I told the receptionist that it was inconvenient at this time and I would bring the card down the following morning - she reluctantly agreed to this. The next morning I took my card down and complained to the duty manager. As a result of my complaint, our breakfast plan was uprgraded (from continental to full) for our stay and a small bottle of port was placed in our room. All in all the discussions were very hostile with none of the charm that I expected from MO staff. In addition our teenage daughter was placed 6 floors away from us despite a specific request to have the rooms close together. The rooms were excellent with magnificent views though the decor slightly tired, the bathrooms were nice and the bed comfortable. Breakfast was a major disappointment, if you are in need of quick service this is not the place for you- it took up to half an hour to get a bowl of cereal and although the staff were running around and polite the delivery seemed to be very inefficient with items missing from orders, and delays requesting milk and coffee. The overall impression was one of chaos with poor staff leadership. The lobby and bar area was the opposite of welcoming; gloomy and cold and seriously in need of a make over. The concierge service was the only aspect of the hotel that lived up to MO standards. I do wonder if there are some serious managerial issues as we overheard numerous other guests complaining both at breakfast and at reception about the service. In fact a friend of ours waiting for us in the lobby commented about the number of guests complaining. In addition the staff seemed preoccupied with internal processes and not focused on the paying guests.

As a matter of fact they are my favorite hotel brand. This was my first stay at the MO San Francisco and probably my last. Here is my opinion on this hotel. Pros: Excellent service just like you would expect from MO Incredible views, I doubt any other hotel can beat their view and this is the same in many of their properties. Cons. Location: great location for business but not so much for a weekend getaway. Lobby and bar: I think that this is the main reason why I would not stay here again. All of the MO that I have stayed in have a spectacular lobby and an even more spectacular bar, usually with an incredible view (Tokyo, NY) and always with a great ambience, I like a hotel with a great bar so that my wife can take her time getting ready while I have a cocktail or two. The lobby of this hotel could be the lobby of any 4-5 star chain hotel, nothing special, but the lobby bar which is right next to the front desk is the dullest bar I have been to in years, it has absolutely nothing special, no view, no ambience no nothing ! Rooms: Although the view was incredible, our room (a bridge to bridge room) was nicely decorated but very small and very plain, again what you would expect from a \"hotel chain\" like Marriot or Westin but definitely not from MO. We picked this room for the view and it was great but it would have been incredible if it had floor to ceiling windows and electric curtains, the windows were small and you have to manually operate the curtains (2 per window times 3 windows). The TV in the room has no pay per view or movie channels which now a days is hard to believe but worst of all was the bathroom, small, dated, old tiles on the shower wall, I could have been at the Omni down the street ! All in all you could say \"you get what you pay for\" because this is I believe MO's least expensive property but if you like to stay at their hotels you are not looking for a bargain, I believe you are wiling to pay for an overall experience that at least for me was not delivered at this hotel.", "Date": "December 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cDo not stay here!

Both the museum and Ferry Building are near Market St., as are several BART subway stops (we would be car-less, taking BART from the airport, SFO, into the city). In the past, we have had memorable stays at the St. Regis, Ritz Carlton, Palace, and Campton Place. All except the Ritz are close to Market St., all except Campton Place have indoor pools. Online, I discovered an enticing California resident weekend rate for the Mandarin Oriental. We have stayed at Mandarins in Hong Kong and New York and think it is a luxurious collection of properties with an elegant Asian aesthetic, so we decided to book here. Of course, we had heard about the Mandarin's vaunted views. The Mandarin is located in the Financial District, 2 blocks north of Market St. This is a very quiet area on weekends--even McDonald's and Starbucks are closed--but more active areas like Union Square and the aforementioned Ferry Building and Market/SOMA are within easy walking distances. The hotel occupies the top 11 floors (38-48) of the 3rd tallest building in San Francisco, so yes, the views are fantastic. The lobby, restaurant, lounge, meeting rooms, well-equipped business center and small fitness center are on the floors 1-4. There is no pool or spa, but guests have access to these at a fitness club across the street. The floors housing the guest rooms are dumbbell-shaped with about 7 rooms at each octagonal end separated by a \"skybridge\" corridor with windows overlooking the bay and city. The 38th floor has 2 suites with large terraces replacing the skybridge. Our reservation was for a city view king, but I noticed online the price point of a bay view queen, with the same square footage, was often identical, so we requested and were given this room type. I thought it well worth it to sacrifice a larger bed for a better view. The bay view extended from the Golden Gate Bridge to Alcatraz, the Transamerica building, Coit Tower, almost to the Bay Bridge. An insulated wicker basket with jasmine tea and almond cookies is delivered shortly after you arrive in your room. The room was beautiful, far from a simple box shape with few 90 degree angles. The sheer shades on the window are elegantly embroidered. The MO channel on the flat screen TV is fun to watch, quite imaginative. There were 2 clocks--one a standard gold alarm clock, the other a fancier clock/CD player whose alarm I couldn't figure out. There is a DVD player and large closet. We had to request slippers. The bathroom was fairly large with 2 types of marble, although the counter space around the single sink was not ample. There was a wall clock whose loud ticking could be heard in the bedroom. The separate stall shower also was large but its tiles reminded me of a locker room. The toiletries and towels were a bit disappointing--the towels neither large nor plush, the toiletries small (1 fluid ounce each). The bath soap was the same tiny size as the soap for the sink. Overall, this was a great short visit to a great city. The SFMOMA exhibits were worthwhile, and although we missed the Farmer's Market at the Ferry Building, we were able to gorge ourselves at Taylor's Automatic Refresher, Mijita, the Slanted Door, and Hog Island Oyster Co., plus Sear's Fine Foods by Union Square. We wanted to try the renowned Dottie's True Blue Cafe in the Tenderloin, but the line was too long.

Finally I went to another bellman and said that guy said I cant park her but I need to check in.. He said \"sorry\" and when and got my luggage. I don't know if the was a language problem or what? But it not the usual greeting I get at hotels. I complained as I checked in and got a cool response apology. It was Valentine Day weekend and stayed in the Lotus Suite. I had flowers delivered and I noticed the bell man had them in his hand in a box.. I quietly said to him why do you have the flowers in your hand in a box, it supposed to be in the room as a surprise. He seemed not to understand as he puts the flower down on the dresser, I ask can I get a vase? It was a weird start to a trip at a 5 star hotel.

I say through out my 3 day stay, I didn't find the front desk to be that friendly like other 5 star hotels, but the room made up for the lack of good customer service. A week after I the trip I received a request for a customer survey like many hotels send. I gave the hotel great marks besides customer service. When I marked down customer service then the survey ask me why low on customer service and I told them what happen when I arrived. Within a week I received a scolding letter from the hotel customer service supervisor mad because I marked them down in customer service. I couldn't believe it? They were saying will we investigated and they were making excuses for the bellman and said the bellman said he was sorry. Which didn't happen the other bellman said sorry for his co worker. But it wasn't just that incident that made me give low grades on customer service, it was the overall way they treated us. They didn't greet you as you pass the lobby, didn't rush to open the door as you came and they weren't that friendly or welcoming.

Great pillows; I slept very well. The bathroom was my favorite. It had a large, deep tub overlooking the city. However, the tub is only big enough to fit one person at a time. The service was good; they were very attentive. Although I must warn you, you will get outrageously charged for everything you do. We wanted to eat at an Indian resturant, so we called the front desk and asked them directions to a nearby Indian place. They were very nice, and even printed out directions for us. However, when we checked-out, we saw that we had been charged $6.00 just for having someone tell us where to eat at. We also had room-service ordered. It was $80 for two entrees and an appetizer. Normally that wouldn't bother me if the food was good, but it was not. In fact, I couldn't even eat most of it because it was so gross. I had the pan-seared seabass. It was way over-cooked and was placed ontop of bland mashed potatoes and prego spaghetti sauce. We also had breakfast ordered the next morning. Breakfast was better, but it was still ridiculously expensive. $50 for two breakfast entrees. A glass of orange juice is $6.00! For a hotel that is so high-class, I was not expecting to pay such outrageous prices for something I could get elsewhere for much, much less. Also, everyone expetcs to be tipped.

An obsequious front desk attendant checked me in and proceeded to bring me up to my room to show me the amenities. While the hotel is housed in what I was told is the third tallest building in San Francisco, the lobby occupies the first floor while the rooms begin I believe somewhere on the high 30s floors. I had a Queen Bay View Room, located on the 41st floor, which allowed unparalleled views of the Transamerica tower, Coit tower, Alcatraz, the Bay Bridge, and the Golden Gate Bridge. There were so many sights to photograph from the room window alone! Luxe Amenities: Hot tea and cookies are presented shortly after arrival. Two different options for bathrobes: one terrycloth, one chunky waffle weave. Slippers and elegant turn down service nightly, along with bottled water presented bedside. Molton Brown toiletries were excellent. Fabulous points: Concierge was amazing and recommended great places to shop, how to differentiate between the trolleys, cable cars, and other modes of transport in the city, where to eat, and also arranged at the spur of the moment for an almost private tour of the city on an 8-person bus. This tour was exhaustive in terms of the areas we explored and the guide was able to take pictures and provide us with even more suggestions for restaurants and places to visit. The van drove us all over the city and we stopped to get out at the more critical spots. It lasted two to three hours and was a very reasonable $50. Back at the hotel, the fresh apples by the elevator were a nice touch, as was the impeccable service which even extended to the cleaning staff. Concerns: I travel very lightly (I only brought one carry-on and a messenger bag on my trip) but even I was surprised at how little drawer space they provided. There were a few at the bottom of the closet but it was tough to locate any others. There was a floor lamp located near the desk which I needed to use for the added light at night, but I had to plug it in myself (very minor concern, obviously). To access the internet, I had to call the front desk and then was transferred to a tech support line, and surprisingly was never charged the access fee at check-out. Also, one major concern (although it provided a bit of comical relief one morning) was that I could hear EVERYTHING the neighbors did in their room. Now, either my neighbors were very loud, or the hotel's walls need a bit more insulation added in the next renovation. Overall: The views from the room make the stay worth every bit of the cost (which drops drastically if you stay any nights between Friday and Sunday as it's primarily a business hotel). I found the location very convenient to SoMa, Union Square, the Farmer's Market at the Embarcadero, and everything else in the city. However, I would not stay at this hotel if a big draw for you is a bustling hotel atmosphere, particularly at night. This hotel is so amazing in part because it is almost museum-like in its quietness (bawdy neighbors aside). While I am also inclined to visit the St. Regis or the Four Seasons for my next trip to San Francisco, the Mandarin's price drop on weekends, mixed with the superlative quality of the views (and the envious looks you get when you mention where you're staying) make it a must to stay here!", "Date": "January 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cAmazing View, Courteous Service, Total Comfort A+++\u201d", "Author": "saintba", "ReviewID": "UR23273901", "Content": "Continuing our journey for our Christmas/New Year's Eve vacation my wife and daughter and I just spent 4 nights at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. It was an amazingly comfortable stay. I booked this hotel over the Ritz and Four Season Hotels which are also great because I'm a sucker for a great view. I'm not sure if it gets much better than this. We booked a Lotus Suite and it had a panoramic view of the city. It was an amazing view both during the day but especially at night. We were on the 45th floor and it was very nice that our room had its own private hallway giving additional privacy. It had a normal doorbell on it as well. The room was VERY spacious. From the moment we checked in the staff was very friendly and professional. I've never stayed at this property before and we were coming from the Ritz Carlton in Naples, Florida and an amazingly upscale house that we stayed in Los Angeles before coming here so we had very high expectations. The hotel lobby is nothing to write home about. Not bad but nothing extra special. The real \"magic\" begins when you rocket up to your rooms in the fast elevators that take you up to your room. I believe most of the rooms have a view but the suites with the really great views are on the 40th floor or higher. Our King size bed was very very comfortable and had a big floor to ceiling window at the side of it so you can keep the curtains open all night and see the skyline. It was extremely romantic! Also, the room had a nice working area (although this was probably the first time in 10 years that I didn't work during a vacation). We have a 5 month old baby which sure does change your priorities and focus in life. This was a great trip with her and the family. Speaking of which the hotel had a baby crib set up for little Katie. The bathroom was very high end and all marble. The room had high speed wireless internet you could buy. I only used it 1 out of the 4 nights. The cost was $12.95 per night and it did seem to work very well. This place certainly isn't cheap. You can spend quite a lot of money here as things add up. For example, they charged a whopping $50 a night for valet parking. That is a bit steep I thought but then again, all around in San Francisco parking was scarce and VERY expensive. If we didn't have a baby with us and stroller I would never have had a car. Most places charged $27 to park 2 hours and that is IF you can find a space. The room was totally comfortable and I doubt you will find a hotel with a better view in San Francisco than the Mandarin Oriental. They do a great job and always go out of their way to help you. Every morning they put the Wall Street Journal, USA Today and London Financial Times under my door when I told them I read them. The room also has a nice LCD TV and also has a DVD player in it which we used. It is a bit awkward as you can't control the DVD from the bed as it's inside the drawer so they might want to change that. They had twice a day full maid service and they did a great job each day. The first day we flew in it was cloudy and we were disappointed that we spent so much money to get a great view and we couldn't see anything. But then God must have answered our prayers as the rest of the stay the weather was glorious and we got tons of amazing photos near the Golden Gate Bridge, Fisherman's Wharf, Union Square, Nob Hill and other areas. San Francisco is truly one of the most beautiful cities in the world. I give an A++ for this hotel and the great service as they always were going out of their way to help.

I booked the room expecting spectacular views and was not disappointed. The room was well appointed, of a reasonable size (I had toyed with the idea of a suite but thought the short stay did not warrant it) and generally satisfactory for a chain hotel. An initial word of warning - the hotel is a little hard to spot; if you expect a large frontage you will go directly past it, as we did. Once we found the entrance, first impressions of the hotel were good; we were greeted politely and our car was promptly parked and our luggage unpacked. The first warning of one of the minor problems with the hotel was the wait for the elevator \u2013 there are only two servicing the hotel and, while the Mandarin Oriental does not cover all 48 floors of the building, there can be a considerable wait, especially at peak times such as breakfast and dinner. Another note of caution I would proffer is that bridge to bridge rooms all have interconnecting doors with adjacent rooms, thus offering families the opportunity to link more than one room during a stay. This is, of course, of benefit to families wishing so to do, however, for those needing a full night\u2019s sleep, the noise that comes through the door can be an unwelcome disturbance \u2013 we were woken on two mornings at 6am by our early rising neighbour\u2019s television. I complained to the front desk, albeit not forcibly, and asked what could be done. Their first suggestion, placing a pillow against the door, was as laughable as it was derisory. Subsequently I was told no other rooms with similar views, I had made this a prerequisite, were available. While I understood and accepted the explanation, I was a touch put out by the lack of apology or indeed the option to upgrade the room. The restaurant on the second floor, Silks, is of a high standard and the meal we had there was one of the highlights of our trip to California \u2013 it exceeded our expectations and bettered many of the establishments we visited that had boasted multiple Michelin Stars. The highlight of the meal, indeed three of the four of us dining chose it, was the exquisite scallop and pork belly starter. The sommelier was well trained and recommended an exceptional wine to accompany our meal \u2013 in fact he chose something cheaper than the bottle I had sought his opinion on. Breakfast was also of a high standard and I would recommend the \u2018Green eggs and ham\u2019 without hesitation. In addition, the barman at the bar on the ground floor provided excellent service and gave sound recommendations. We found the front desk staff of mixed ability and demeanour. The concierge was a delight to deal with and he helpfully made reservations for us and printed off various pieces of information without hesitation. In contrast, the main front desk team seemed rather inexperienced and some struggled a little with spoken English. All in all, the Mandarin Oriental is a great hotel to stay in if one is visiting San Francisco, however, it is not a destination in itself. The views aside, there are thousands of hotels across the globe that do exactly the same thing at exactly the same sort of price.

As well documented, the hotel occupies the upper levels of a tower block. First impressions were not good - the lobby is dark and shabby and light years away from other Mandarins such as in Miami. Things did not improve when we entered our Dynasty Suite - the rooms were dark and the layout not at all attractive. Whilst the soft furnishings had supposedly recently been upgraded, the decor in the two bathrooms was shocking - poor lighting, seventies' style mini tiles in the shower and the shower head height located somewhere around my chest. On our floor at least, the rooms were laid out in a barbell with approximately six in a cul de sac formation at each end of the hotel. This very quickly became an issue when we became aware of the sound proofing in the suite - there is none.

I spent many hours trying to decide where to stay. On my last trip in June I chose the Four Seasons; it was a superlative experience and a good value to boot. But I wanted something different. I originally booked the St. Regis, but the numerous Trip Advisor comments about noise worried me; the location of the Ritz Carlton does not appeal to me, so sort of by default that got me to the Mandarin Oriental. After reading all the reviews of this property, I can say that I understand both the positive and the negative comments. No hotel is perfect (or at least I haven't been there yet!), so it really depends on what you value for your money. Let me start with the positives. 1. As everyone says, the view is unbeatable. I had an executive king with a view south and west. I could see some of the Bay Bridge, but very little of the Golden Gate. If that view is important to you, you need to book a higher category room. Expect to pay $100-200 more per night for that privilege. And, as others have noted, there is no guarantee that you will have that view if there is thick fog, as there was for most of my stay. 2. I loved the layout and decor of the room. In fact, I was shown a bridge to bridge room and a Mandarin king (the pricey one) and the living area in my room was more spacious. The color scheme (red, gold, white) is cheerful yet soothing. The furnishings, art work, throw pillows, bamboo plant, sheer blinds, etc. are all lovely. The bed linens were top of the line, really, really silky smooth. Great air conditioning, although I'm not sure I really needed it in the chilly August fog. 3. The hotel is very quiet for a big city. I think being on the 41st floor keeps out a lot of street noise. I heard doors in the halls, but not people, even on a fully booked Saturday night. There are only about 15 rooms per floor, divided by the walkway, so there just aren't that many guests to make noise. Now for the not so good. 1. As a luxury hotel bathroom junkie, the M.O. was a bit disappointing. Mine was a bit small, with a very narrow tub. There are appeared to be three types of wall covering, the ugliest of which is in the separate shower. In the other rooms I saw the walls of the separate shower were marble where mine was just ugly yellow tile. The Mandarin King bath with the tub by the window is lovely, but it does not compare to the bath at the Four Seasons. The towels were a bit scratchy and I didn't care for the toiletries. I went from two bathmats on the first day, to one on the second to none of the third. Housekeeping must have forgotten. But the room itself was super clean. 2. The public areas of the hotel are sort of dark and pretty small. I don't spend time in public areas, so this didn't matter to me. But the appeal of the hotel is on the upper floors. It's really too bad that Silks has no natural light windows because it is a pretty space. 3. I was on a breakfast package so I had two meals in Silks and one from room service. They were okay. Be aware that you are kept to a $32 per per person maximum for the package. At the Four Seasons they just paid whatever I spent (one breakfast upwards of $50). 4. For the non-smokers: this hotel is pretty lax about smoking in rooms. I was told the only floor where smoking was allowed was on the 48th, but there was definitely a fresh cigarette smell in my 41st floor room on Saturday night. One of the staff told me that they don't charge people for smoking in non-smoking rooms as there are a lot of Asian and European clients who smoke. I found this annoying. 5. No wifi the rooms, ethernet connection only. Not enough information about TV channels and no info on PPV. 6. The staff did not impress me much. Check in was chaotic -- the person serving me seemed not to know what she was doing, and there was a problem processing my credit card. It turns out it was the M.O. system and not my card, but the 15 minutes spent trying to figure this out was embarassing and annoying. I found the breakfast server unfriendly. But these negatives do not outweigh the positives, and all things considered, I would definitely stay here again. The price was reasonable for a luxury hotel in one of the world's greatest cities, and I really, really loved the room. The pictures posted on trip advisor and on the hotel website are accurate.

The queen rooms aren't huge, but are certainly comfortable enough and the bathrooms are quite large even in this smaller room category. The absolutely spectacular view, taking in the \"greatest hits\" of San Francisco--Transamerica Pyramid, Coit Tower, Alcatraz, and the Golden Gate--makes the room feel larger. From my room, I could lie in bed and look at the GG in the distance. I also had a perfectly-framed view of the fireworks down at the Embarcadero. The lobby is smallish, but the greeting staff is top-notch and you will feel like a cherished guest every time you enter or exit. The lounge is just off the lobby and can't quite escape its '80s layout, but there is a great deal of seating so you could usually get a quiet table. Bar staff is professional and attentive. Dinner at Silks, tucked away by itself on the 2nd floor, was a relaxed, calming, and delicious evening. The restaurant's more of a lunch spot, so evenings tend to be quiet. The chef's tasting menu was wonderfully creative and had four well-sized courses plus three amuse-bouche servings, including a post-dessert combo of hot chocolate and bitter German beer that was an innovative meal-ender. I had figured the price was so good on the holiday because of the Financial District location being a bit off the usual tourist path. However, I found the location to be quite convenient. It was a five-minute walk from the Montgomery St. BART station, a ten-minute walk from the Ferry Building [you must try Cowgirl Creamery], and ten-minute walk [straight up] to Nob Hill. If you're a hotel junkie like me, you can explore the Fairmont [lethal rum drinks at the Tonga Room], the Mark Hopkins, the Ritz-Carlton, and the Huntington all in one easy loop once on Nob Hill. Other SF must-dos: Dinner at Gary Danko will leave you reaching for superlatives; Cafe Claude is a nifty French bistro on the edge of Chinatown; a bay cruise under the Golden Gate bridge is awe-inspiring. All in all, even with the many great hotels in SF, I would feel very comfortable returning to the Mandarin Oriental.

You feel special every time you walk in. After service and hospitality the next best thing is... the views. This hotel has the best views of San Francisco you have ever seen and an upgrade to a room with a Golden Gate view is well worth it. The views are indescribable. I knew what to expect, but it still takes my breath away, my girlfriend had not been and was, as I anticipated, stunned! As I did on my first visit, she sat and drank in the views for an hour after we arrived :-) I do love the place and will always try to visit if and when I am in the area although I would note there are one or two very small niggles starting to appear. I doubt they will remain for long and do not spoil anything but things like the heat lamp timer in the bathroom being from the 80's and the TV speaker in the bathroom not working were surprising. But Ia) who really needs those things and b) I repeat... the hotel is still fantastic! The turn down service is wonderful and when you return in the evening it feels like home (although I urge you to open the curtains again to take in the sensational night time city view). Being in the financial district the hotel is well placed for all transport, including a tram at the end of the block. Close to the bay and very close to the main shopping centres. Not so close to Fishermans Wharf but that's not such a bad thing.

We have stayed at M.O. before in New York and fell in love with their attention to service. Upon arrival we were greeted warmly and offered complimentary tea service. We asked for early check in and were granted early check in at 11:00 a.m. We were greeted by hotel employees as we entered and exited the hotel. They were very warm and friendly and even greeting us by name. Our room had a wonderful view of the Golden Gate Bridge and the Coit Tower. We had our tea service in the afternoon after a day of shopping. The tea pot arrived in a large basket along with almond cookies. After we came back from dinner, cold water was waiting for us along with slippers next to our bed. We had a wonderful stay. My only issue was our neighbors who departed in the middle of the night. They were very loud and entered and exited their room several times before departure. The clock alarm also went off at 5:00 a.m. so I guess the last guest forgot to turn it off. I finally took the battery out since I couldn't figure out how to turn it off at 5:00 a.m. in the dark. Minus these few events which the hotel had no control of we had a great stay. I would advise that some local restaurants were closed when we arrived. I believe that since this is a business area that some small restaurants are closed on the weekends. This is not a big deal since you will want to experience the wonderful restaurants in other parts of the city especially Micheal Mina at the Westin St. Francis. Hands down my favorite restaurant.

We booked a Bridge to Bridge room which had a 180 degree view from the Golden Gate to the Oakland Bay Bridge, and it really was amazing! The hotel itself is in the business district but the area had quite a lot of parking which was a bonus. We decided to take full advantage of our room so didn't venture out into the surrounding area, however as we were there on a Sunday night everything seemed very quiet when we drove in. The ground floor reception area is nice, clean, modern and well decorated with a very polite reception staff who booked us in quickly and with no fuss. The ground floor has a nice bar/lounge area where they serve lovely cocktails, a great variety of wines and delicious (complimentary) snacks of nuts and olives. I have to admit that my one reservation about staying here was also the main reason for the stay - the height. The room was on the 42nd floor which gave it such beautiful and stunning views (from the large windows as well as the glass walled corridors) but also meant a long elevator ride, which for a claustrophobic was quite a daunting prospect. Thankfully, the elevators are large and airey and speed directly to the 40th floor (they don't stop before this as the first 39 floors are offices) so the experience was pretty painless! The rooms themselves are wonderful with large, comfortable beds and sparkling, well laid out bathrooms. We ordered room service and spent the evening eating incredible stone baked pizzas and drinking champage whilst admiring the view and it is an experience I would highly recommend. The complimentary binoculars were very much appreciated and came in handy for zooming in on Alcatraz and the Bridges. All in all, this a wonderful place to stay, it's extremely comfortable and whilst it may be a little more expensive than other places the views make it worth every single penny.

I've stayed in the Four Seasons and the Ritz and many other hotels in SF. Four Seasons may have better rooms in terms of architecture and the modern facility, but the location is not desirable (too many homeless wandered nearby and didn't feel safe at night). Nothing stands out at the Ritz; it has no view and its location is mediocre; services were good but the decor is a bit stuffy, old school like, typical of the Ritz chain. The view, services, and location at the MO makes it the best choice for me. I stayed at the Bridge to Bridge View room in July 2006 and the Golden Gate Bridge Mandarin King in August 2007. The main difference is that the Mandarin King has a bathroom with the tub by a large window with fantastic view. From the 48th floor, watching clouds rolling in below us and birds flying by the window, we felt like we were in an airplane. The sky bridge on every floor provides panoramic view of the entire city. Check out my photos for the amazing view. The services at the MO are always top notch. It's not the kind of hotel to nickel and dime its guests (unlike many other five star hotels). The business center offers computers with free internet access and printing (FS and the Ritz charge like $10 for 15 minutes). Also, I called up the room service to inquire about the name of the complementary wine we received upon arrival and was instead offered another complementary bottle. Housekeeping services were good and discreet. Its location is the best compared to the the FS and the Ritz. It's close to Embarcadero and the clock tower, next to a cable car line and the Bart station, within walking distance to Chinatown and the downtown shopping area. The food from the room services were quite good but the taxes, services charges, and gratuity accounted for a third of the bill. I didn't like the fact the the invoice include both 18% gratuity and services charges of $2.5/person, it seems like double charging but at least it's disclosed properly.

The hotel is the best hotel that we have ever experienced - truly a 5 star. We were fortunate to have a room on the corner of the 45 floor and the views of the bay and city were spectacular. I cannot imagine any better views within the city. This was our first trip to explore San Francisco and we could not have been more pleased with our hotel experience. Room - outstanding from every perspective! The size of the room is huge - a spacious seating area with chairs and sofa, desk for business or internet use with an incredible view of the city all the way to Monster field. The hotel even provides binoculars to provide a close up view of all the city and the room has three large windows that almost provide panoramic views. The decor of the room is gold and black asian theme that is very tasteful and well done. The room is so spacious in ever way including the closet, built-ins for luggage, and a very large bathroom. The room has a large LG LCDTV that swivels for the entire viewing from any angle. A DVD player is also provided along with CD/radio for music and alarm. The window treatments were awesome in that there was a transparent screen and blinds with the Mandarin logo for allowing light in, but shielding the sun at the same time. The windows do open which was nice to allow some air into the room, but also allowed in some noise from the city below. Nice touch, but I would not think that many would open windows 45 floors up... The bed is elevated to allow you to enjoy the views out of the windows from the bed and the bedding is top notch. I normally do not sleep well in hotels when traveling, but this bed and bedding provided the best night's sleep ever - outstanding! The bathroom was quite large with separate large shower, tub, and plenty of space for everything. All of the accessories that you could imagine are provided down to the bathroom scales. Every detail was well planned and executed to the light switches for turning on/off lamps beside the bed. Everything was at your fingertips including a single remote control that controlled multiple electronic devices. We were delivered hot tea and cookies of our choice upon check-in. Turndown service provides house shoes, cloth on the floor for stepping into an out of bed, robes, window treatments closed, turndown, music, etc. the list goes on - dimmers on all lights, etc. Other minor details - the iron was the best ever at a hotel - high quality every place - marble and stainless in the bathroom, the soap and shampoo, etc. The elevator was extremely fast and the walk from the elevator across the bridge or connector provides the best views in the city - bay and city views - fabulous! I used the workout facility and it was very nice - TVs on the equipment with headphones provided - my only complaint for the workout facility was the treadmills did not provide any space to hold a bottle of water - you had to place on the floor which caused interruption in workout to stoop and get a bottle of water... They provided chilled water, apples, bananas, plenty of towels, very nice equipment with the exception of the treadmills as noted. The staff were very nice and would do everything to accommodate our requests. The concierge made Alcatraz reservations and made very good dinner recommendations outside of their hotel restaurant - Silks. We wanted to experience some of the other places for meals and did not dine at Silks within the hotel. Cons - valet parking is $50 per day - very pricey, but about the norm in San Fran. For the price of the daily room rate - it should include high speed internet - I think requiring additional $12.95 per day is ridiculous since every thing else is incredible. First impression - the lobby does not provide the overall first impression that you would expect from a 5 star hotel, but wait until you get off the elevator and move to a room before you judge the hotel. This hotel does not the have the marvelous lobby of the Fairmont per se, but the rooms are out of this world as compared to any other hotel in the city.

The one drawback to our type of room, high up with great views, was that no one wants to close their curtains. If you aren\u2019t careful you can see other people in their rooms, and they can see you. This is just something to be aware of. I mean, the room comes with binoculars so it is no surprise that a bit of people watching occurs. The bathroom was quite nice. There was a volume control on the wall by the sink so you could hear the TV or CD player in the next room while in the bathroom. The speaker was under the sink. I have stayed in a lot of hotels, but I have never seen this feature before. The hotel had great towels, robes and slippers, and Caswell Massey toiletries.

People gripes and compliments regarding this hotel are both actually pretty accurate. This is essentially a boutique property, with a small lobby, lounge and restaurant on the first two floors of a high rise, with the rooms at the top of the tower. The public areas are small, and good looking enough, but for some reason feel very impersonal, and lack lounging space. The rooms, while not large, are not too small, but are beautifully decorated in a mixture of European and Asian furniture. The bedrooms are essentially like jewel boxes in the sky, and the views are breathtaking. The bathrooms, as other have noted, look a bit worse for the wear, but have a separate soaking tub and shower, which seems to be where the 5 stars try to break from the 4 star chain hotels. The baths, while spotless, apparently were not renovated with the rest of the rooms ... they have that \"glamorous\" 1980s look -- chunky beige and pink marble with gold fixtures. I suspect the baths have had little change since the hotel opened in 1987. The service, as one anticipates, was very, very good -- from the welcome tea service to the friendly and informative desk and door people. All in all, this is a 5 star hotel, but one that disappoints slightly. If you want a nice room with a great view, don't hesitate to book here.

The lobby and lobby lounge area are quite small, pokey and tired. Very similar oriental decor to the old Mandarin Hong Kong but without the scale of the space. The reception staff were, however, extremely welcoming and informative. The staff and service were generally one of the high points of the stay. The public areas really are a huge disappointment. The carpet designs are particularly jarring - lacking any finesse or subtlety. A pity that the design of the refurbishment did not emulate the contemporary design of the new Landmark Mandarin or The Mandarin New York. The good points about this hotel include the views and the room size. We had a corner suite facing away from the harbour. I'm sure the suites that face onto the harbour are quite amazing. Having windows on two sides of the room really gave the suite a feeling of spaciousness and lightness. The decor looks dated even though this room was recently refurbished. The bathroom is a disappointment - reasonable in scale but again shabby. On turning on the water the shower head fell off the wall causing water to flood into the room. This required us to change to another room and the staff were prompt and courteous in finding another room. One interesting and welcome feature was the ability to open the window to obtain fresh air - yes and on level 44 of the tower ! Scary. The room service was amongst the best we had ever had and reminded me of the superlative cuisine of the Mandarin Hong Kong (not the Mandarin Landmark). We had breakfast in the restaurant, Silks, on the lower level of the tower. Such a shame that it doesn't have the amazing views of the rooms. All these criticisms apart we did enjoy our stay and found the location quite central and convenient. We have found the Mandarin Oriental hotels to be of quite varying standards. The Mandarin New York is by far the best we have stayed at. The Landmark Mandarin Hong Kong has a superlative contemporary room design. The Mandarin London is one hotel I'd rather forget !

The service was impeccable - the concierge was more than happy to research and answer my random questions. This is an expensive hotel - if on company expenses, it would be a no brainer to stay here.

We had a corner room, the views were stunning. The bed and bedding were superb. Sitting areas were very good, the bathtub was right next to a huge panoramic window. The tub itself could have been bigger, it was definitely too small for 2 (but we squeezed in anyway.) Amenities were by Escada, nice touch, perhaps a little too chemical for me (I prefer L'Occitane.)

As others have noted, there isn't a better view in town - lying in my bed (I was in a Bridge to Bridge Room) I could see just about every notable attraction in town - the bridges, Coit Tower, Alcatraz, etc., etc. etc. However, this is where the greatness in this hotel ends. Though I usually stay at the Four Seasons when I vacation, I decided that I ought to give the Mandarin a shot - hey, AAA Five Diamond, Mobile 5 Star - it can't be that bad.......let's find out: A stain on the bed sheet; pink gum on the top left door of the bathroom stall; foot prints on the carpet; mug stains on the marble around the sink and on a coffee table; a turn down service that was so insistent on getting the job done that they returned twice within an hour (the last time forcing themselves into the room as I dressed for the evening); a lobby and lounge staff about as personable as a paper weight; a doorman that was on his cell phone more often than he opened the door; and a concierge staff that said they would call me to follow up on an inquiry and forgot one too many times. These unmentionables were during the first two days - at which point I started complaining to my wife - telling her that we had made a mistake in the hotel we had chosen and that this hotel didn't hold a candle to the Four Seasons. I'm not one to publicly complain, but this deserved it, and my wife, without me knowing it, went down to the lobby, pulled a manager into the lounge, and in a very nice manner, without any of the aforementioned detail, summed it up for the manager by saying that the place sucked! The manager proceeded to offer my wife breakfast, a discount, etc. My wife refused everything, which she said surprised the manager. But, we weren't looking for handouts - we were looking for the level of service and attention to detail that we had expected when booking a hotel company that claims that it can and does deliver (and which I and many of you had read about and which I personally had heard about from some of my wife's colleagues who have stayed at their hotels in Asia). Well, over the next two days the level of service did a 180 - not just for us, but noticibly for everyone else as well! For us, the hotel town car, which hadn't been offered before - was now at our becking call; our names were used regularly upon entrance into and from the hotel; the front door was sprinted to as anyone approached; and we got reservations, on fairly short notice, to two of the city's hottest restaurants - Slanted Door and Betelnut. In summary, I guess I left wondering why this hadn't been the case from the moment we got there. If it had been, I wouldn't have written a few of the above paragraphs. This can be a phenomenal hotel with a few modern updates to the rooms, the fitness and business centers (sorry, fitness and business closets), and complete consistency in service. Maybe I was there on a bad week, but hopefully, we did everyone staying there from now on a favor - I doubt it though - excellence isn't sporadic and I am pondering on whether I should give them another fat chunk of my wallet at another one of their hotels/resorts. Can't beat it if you want a view, but don't pay these prices for a view - go to the Top of the Mark for a cocktail and stay at the Four Seasons where your wallet gets you treated like the well-paying customer you are.

The hotel is on the upper floors of the building (I was on 43rd floor) and my room seemed very large for a non-suite (actually had a hallway); my friend's room wasn't quite as large but still roomy and big compared to most hotels I've stayed in. And although I'm not a very demanding traveler and don't need all the perks associated with some of the more decadent/full-service oriented types, the few times I needed help the excellent service came through. A fax I was expecting was ready for me within 5 minutes, and evey time I asked the concierge to check on my flight or make restaurant reservations it was done immediately. Allin all, the service was very polite and timely. The bathrooms in the room were large and contained everything you could possibly need - including a bath and separate shower. The bed was extremely comfortable - as was waking up to an almost 180 degree view of SF et environs every morning!! (I will have to bring my girlfriend here sometime). On the negative side, a few minor things. First, there are only 2 elevators which made for a couple minutes of waiting from time to time (usually not a problem). Also, the gym is very small and on the 4th floor with no windows which isn't ideal and not what I'm used to at other MO's (DC and NYC) which have much larger gyms with views and a pool (DC at least) - no pool here (unlike the Ritz and Four Seasons). And the hotel lobby is nice but pretty understated and small so don't expect a grand entrance - the location and views are what you pay for here. I will come back to this hotel, but as I'm a big exerciser I think that the Ritz and Four Season are also great choices if you want a larger gym and pool.
