Skylight but no window but I was only there to sleep and shower so I didn't care. Love the location! Cost was about $200 for one person including taxes. They let me store my bags there for the day after I checked out. Only complaint was that it was warm in the room and the air conditioning was not functional. A fan would have been helpful.

It must be fairly newly renovated because the room although small was neat, clean and newer. It had a good bed and a very large flat screen TV. There is no phone in the rooms but it doesn\u2019t\u2019 matter because there is no meal service what so ever. I was on the fourth floor so the subway noise was minimal. I have heard that if you are on the lower floors it can be a bit noisy. My only 2 complaints are that the floor squeaked when I walked on it and I almost ran out of soap the third day there. Fortunately I finally received a new one on my fourth night. The wireless is free but it is spotty, so be aware. Also their pricing policy seems a bit odd. I paid a different rate for different nights midweek. The room was a bit warm but the weather wsa warm so i'm certain they couldn't switch from heat to cooling. All in all it was a good clean room for a very good price in NYC. I\u2019ll go back.

We really enjoyed the free buffet breakfast because it made all the difference in the mornings. The breakfast consisted of bagels, toast, various pastries, hardboiled eggs, coffee, juice, fruits etc.The common areas are modern and stylish and since it is very small hotel so no crowds nor long waits for elevator. The staff is friendly and helpful. We had a queen room which was big for NYC standards. It had windows towards Broadway but we did not keep the curtains open because we could see people in the opposite building, so I thought they could see us as well\uf04a The subway was indeed very loud but we always travel with earplugs so it did\u2019t bother us. Room was modern except the carpet which I think looked worn. I really enjoyed the new linen, comforter, pillows and bed which was quite firm.

The bathroom in our room lacked a decent sized shelf for cosmetics, etc., but my son who only uses a toothbrush and paste was fine. I needed to ask for more soap which I found a bit annoying.

I made my reservation through Booking.com. When I arrived at the hotel, the woman at the front desk reported that they'd 'just received the fax' from the booking site. The fax? What is this, 1993? Shouldn't this be done by, you know, computer? Apparently, the room that I'd booked for two nights was only available for one night. The front desk lady tried to convince me to take the room for one night, then switch to another room the next night. I allowed as how I'd prefer one room for two nights, as that's what I'd booked. After several minutes she simply offered me the second night's room for both nights. \"Why didn't you just give me that in the first place?\" I inquired. \"That room is larger - the room you reserved is smaller.\" This was at 6:30 in the evening. Perhaps they were waiting for someone to make a last minute, one-night reservation for the larger room...but it struck me as just poor customer service. So, 'upgraded' to the larger room, I settled in. I went to the bathroom, and noticed some sort of fly on the mirror. Oh, and there's another by the sink. And another on the shower curtain. I'm not one to make a fuss, so I killed four of the insects and went on about my business. However, the flies (or whatever they were) seemed to return in groups of three or four throughout my stay. It wasn't until I was in bed that night that I noticed the dripping noise from the floor above...and the water damage to a corner of the ceiling...and the black mold growing there. Of course I reported all this to the front desk, and they were very polite and apologetic, and even sent someone up to look, but apparently there was nothing to be done. All of which would have been more or less harmless, had it not been in the low teens in NYC last night. The room had no heat. I got back to the hotel around 9pm and reported the heat problem. Then again around 11pm when it wasn't any better. Then around 5am when the cold woke me up, despite assurances that they'd fixed the problem. I finally decided to get out, shower somewhere warmer (the gym) and take my leave of the Hotel Verite. They were kind enough to credit me for the heat-less night...but I cannot recommend this hotel to others.

Hotel is small and intimate. Staff were lovely, very helpful and attended to requests immediately. We called reception for an extra blanket and it was delivered within minutes.

Other reviews have complained about beds too hard and subway noise - beds ARE firm but still comfortable and you do hear the trains below you BUT neither of these things kept us awake - we always slept soundly. location is fantastic - around the corner from Union Station and 2 stops from Times Square. The \"Hop on Hop off\" bus stops around the corner as well. You have a view of the Empire State Building as you walk from Union Station to the hotel. Restaurants and supermarkets are also around the corner. We booked this hotel because they offered a complimentary breakfast daily, however, the breakfast service had ceased a few months before our stay. Because the hotel had not updated their website and removed the breakfast information they immediately told us we would happily refunded a percentage of our stay upon checkout, which they did graciously. Only a few little things to criticize - not a lot of cupboard space for 5 people even though our room could have accommodated another cupboard. Toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, soap) were not replenished each day and some days we would only get 4 towels instead of 5. Oh, and no wash cloths / face washers which I'm told is common in NY hotels - with 3 children I needed face washers.

Perfect location, great rates, warm staff, and clean/comfortable accommodations. I was thinking of not reviewing this place because I wanted to keep it my NYC secret, but im sure it will become very popular. Their rates go from $275 to $330 for a queen single room (which is an unusually low rate for clean hotels in this area). The LOCATION is perfect. A 10 minute walk from Grand Central Station and/or where the Bolt Bus drops you off, and a 5 minute walk to Union Square (where you'll find an excellent farmer's market on Saturday mornings). Subways surround the hotel, and tons of shopping including Macy's, Banana Republic, Armani Exchange, etc. are within 5 minutes walking distance. If you feel like walking, you can get to Times Square in 30 minutes (or a cheap cab ride or subway). The ACCOMMODATIONS were impressive. I noticed people reviewed that the beds were hard. This is because the beds are top-quality Tempur-Pedic / Foam which is expensive and very good for your back. You may not be used to it, but it is the way to go. All feather/down blankets and pillows. VERY MODERN bathroom with tile walls, glass shower and raindrop showerhead. The only drawback (that my Fiance mainly had a problem with) was there was no full-length mirror in our queen single room... The staff was very accommodating from the start. They will hold your bags before/after checkout in a secure, locked room. They could not have been friendlier, and were very responsive to accommodate my down/fur allergy.
