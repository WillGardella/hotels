The people working the counter were very friendly, can't say so much for reservations. When I called the guy couldn't understand what I was saying and I couldn't understand what he was saying. There's also the matter of the people in the floor above stomping around at 7:00 in the morning. We could hear every step they took, and it did sound like a herd of elephants.

We arrived one day early and stayed one day after. While there we stayed both times at the Ramada Limited in Tukwila which is about 10 minutes from the airport. We arrived at SeaTac and called for the van. It arrived shortly. Some words of advice for those who call for the shuttle. Look for a van with a large red ball with white numbers painted on it. If it doesn't have this, it will be a van for the other Ramada which is also located in the area. Our driver verified that we were on the correct van as we boarded. We were somewhat concerned that the motel might not meet our needs as it is not located in an area where there are a lot of Seattle attractions. Nor are there other than fast food restaurants in the immediate area. Nor is it located in an upscale neighborhood. Everything worked out fine thanks to the manager, Jaspal Singh, and his staff. It turned out to be a very good place to stay. The staff is friendly, courteous, cordial, and very helpful. They will make the van available to you for a very reasonable fee to take you to nice restaurants that are located in the immediate Tukwila area but that are too far to walk to. We used the van the first night of our stay and tried a cab the second night. The van was much better. They also went out of their way to help us set up a self guided walking tour of downtown Seattle, patiently answering all our questions and what-ifs. We used the light rail system to get there. ($5 per adult round trip ticket and $2.50 for seniors. Such a deal. Taking a cab would break the bank.) The van dropped us at the light rail station which is about 3/4 mile from the motel and 25 minutes later we were in downtown Seattle. Taking the train will get you near the main Seattle attractions such as Pike Street Market, the pier, the Space Needle and downtown. You will also see the big sports stadiums before you enter the underground tunnel near down town. On our way back we called the motel from the train station and the van again came to pick us up. It took us back to the motel where we later collected our luggage that the manager had put in storage for the day and we were later delivered to the airport. All the while of our stay we were made to feel like valued customers. With regard to the motel itself, it is not a large one. But it is clean, well maintained and relatively quiet. Continental breakfast is of the coffee, milk, juice, oatmeal, cereal, bagel, English muffin, fresh fruit variety. It is enough to successfully get your day going. The eating tables and chairs are fair sized and comfortable. Underground parking is available and there are a few stalls in front of the building. There is a computer and printer for checking e-mails or e-checkins for flights. The rooms have older type televisions but they work well once you master the quirks of the cable provider. Bathrooms are separate from the vanity area which will make the ladies happy as it avoids steaming mirrors. The vanity itself is wide and has good room to put all your stuff. Storage is ample.

I knew our stay at the Ramada Limited was going to be an unpleasant one when my mother, two sisters, eighty year old travelling companion and I drove up to the shady looking establishment. Several pimps and prostitutes were loitering around the area and the neighborhood appeared to be one of ill repute. Upon entering the hotel, we noticed it\u2019s outdated and worn out appearance. The carpet in the hallway leading to our room smelled and looked like something had recently died and decomposed on it. The horror show really began when we entered our room. It smelled like a pack of bums had previously inhabited it before we did. The carpet was stained, the furniture was dusty, and the beds were dirty and unkempt. I was inspecting the room further when one of my earrings fell off of my ear and happened to roll underneath the nearest sofa. It was when I was reluctantly lifting the flap on the sofa that I received a horrifying shock! I found the earring and was about to reach for it when I noticed some suspicious looking objects! Words cannot described how sickened I felt when I finally indentified the objects as being a clear plastic bag of white powder and a bloody syringe! My mother then called the manager. We informed him that we wanted a refund and he said that he already had charged our credit card for a full night\u2019s stay. He adamantly continued to refuse to give us our money back and said that he would give us a new room instead. Later on, I went to the ice machine and was totally disgusted when I saw that the dispenser was covered in slimy green residue and surrounded by garbage!

We came back at 10 am on a Sunday from breakfast and there was absoutely no parking spots in the lot or underground. We checked out at that point. 30 days later we are checking our credit card statement and there was a $353 extra charge from the hotel. ???

And he said that we stole the router and he charged our credit card! (can you spell fuming mad at this point??) We called the Tukwila Police Dept. and no police report was filed about any theft. We contacted our credit card company and they put the courtesy credit on until situation was resolved. We called Ramada corporate and filed a complaint. We called our relocation company (I was being transfered to Seattle for my job). We called American Express who made the reservation for us. We called my employer where I have worked for 30 years. A week later my wife got a call from the manager with a tepid apology saying in fact it was the people who stayed the night after us who stole the wireless router. Of course he forgot that originally he told us that nobody stayed in the room for 4 days and then they discovered it. He said our credit card was being credited and the next day the credit showed up. My wife coldly told him that he called us thieves and he should be ashamed of his conduct. In 30 years of corporate and leisure travel, we have never had such a horrible experience at a hotel. I think the guy thought we were out of towners and perhaps we would not review our credit card statement. I did not read any of the comments prior to mine until after this expereince was concluded.

We had discussed just cancelling and just paying for the one-night penalty (getting a nicer place in the City) - but decided that it was just a weekend and give it a go. However, when we finally got back from the City proper to check in (early in the evening) we were pleasantly surprised.

I've always been satisfied. This experience changed my travel reservation habits forever. Dissatisfaction doesn't even begin to describe my experience there. \"Stunned\" is more like it. There seems to be large confusion in Seattle about Ramadas. There are 4 or 5 of them. Most of them are called \"Inn's.\" Such as the Ramada Inn and Suites very near Sea-Tac. This place I'm talking about is the Ramada Limited in Tukwila. \"Very\" should be part of the name. I will never again book a hotel without knowing which one it is. And, I will never again stay at a Ramada. Just the fact that they have this facility in their system scares me. I stayed two nights, and wanted to run from there one hour after arriving but I was stuck as I already paid in full and it was late. First, the van they picked me up in was very old and didn't look business-like, and the upholstery was very stained. Next, it was well over 2 miles North of Sea-Tac, on the old Pacific Highway, in a run-down/transitional neighborhood. Casinos and \"smoke rooms\" in the area. Two miles North of the Ramada Inn and Suites (someone in October confused them in a review). Last, on arrival, there was a group of around 6 or 7 very unsavory (scary) looking characters hanging out on the corner on 139th, just as we were arriving. Only a few feet from the door. I walked into the lobby at night, after getting out of a medical conference at the Marriott-SeaTac and the lobby was very small and \"Court-TV\" was on full blast in the lobby. The lobby had a look of decay, with old, dusty fake flowers and unhealthy plants and ugly furniture. The place only has 38 rooms, so (lucky me) I got the room right off the lobby. Could not sleep as the lobby TV was so loud. I was too afraid to ask them to turn it down as I didn't want to leave my room or draw attention to myself, being alone. Decided to have a cup of Decaf coffee, and turned the coffee cups over and both were totally filthy. Had coffee residue (easily seen and felt) from the last resident, (not washed) as did both water glasses. Absolutely filthy. Almost made me sick. I turned them in the next morning and there were clean ones in my room when I returned late last night, but still? When I pulled back the covers to go to bed, someone either did not know how to make a bed, or they didn't make it --- from the last person in there. Everything was very rumpled and unkempt-looking. I've never seen anything like it in all my years staying in hotels. Furniture was very old, spare and plastic. Plumbing didn't work well, as both the bathtub and sink did not drain. I took a shower in the morning, and when I left the room an hour later, there was still standing water --- despite my attempts to get it to go down. Not to mention the hair and ground-in dirt on the floor. This morning, when I left for the airport, I showed up downstairs and they said the driver would take me right there. In actuality, he spent 30 minutes doing other things, while I both waited and made two more requests. Paid no attention to my need to get to the airport. Ignored me, while I was standing there. And, I had to get to my flight! Even with making reservations online, there were so many problems and \"misses\" with this hotel that I'm appalled and will definitely change my reservation habits. Evidently, they call it \"Limited\" because it is. Not to be confused with the other Ramada Inn's, including the Ramada Inn and Suites near the airport. The \"limited\" is very far from the airport and not in any neighborhood a tourist would ever want to visit. People probably confuse them because they are both on \"International Blvd.\" But, the other one is near the airport and is probably much nicer.
