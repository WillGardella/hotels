Now when in Orlando you arnt in your hotel much so with this in mind this hotel was perfect. The cost was reasonable and the pool adequate for the odd hour the kids used it. The hotel is not luxury so dont expect all the trimmings. It is located just off I drive and within walking distance of a couple of reasonably priced restaurants, Ponderosa being one of our favorites along with CiCi's pizza where you can get 3 take away pizzas for $10! The hotel breakfast is okay and you have to remember it's free! Cerial ( sweet American brands that not even my kids touched) waffles machine which was a hit , muffins donuts, bagels, toast, eggs, biscuits and gravy ( only hubby was brave enough for this) juice . There is always tea, coffee and hot chocolate available in the cafe area which was nice. Now the only down side is the couple of locals that seem to hang around the outside of the hotel and seemed to be partaking in dubious activities but they never approached us and always moved when we passed but thought I should mention it.

There are 7 in our party so we needed two rooms, unfortunately the hotel does not have connecting rooms, however the staff was able to put us close together. At the time of booking we were told that the hotel was going through renovation. While the rooms were fine for our purposes they are in need of an upgrade, one room had a funny smell and was very humid. Since we spent most of our time at Universal it wasn't a big deal, we got used to it. Hopefully the renovation will create some connecting rooms, replace worn rugs and eliminate musty smells? The hotel is located on a very quiet street, an oasis from the highly congested area nearby. Getting to Universal Studios took very little time, about 7 minutes, so wonderful at the start of the day (we were among the first cars in the parking garage) and even better at the end of the day. There was plenty of parking and our family felt very safe. Many restaurants are with in walking distance. The pool was an adequate size and we enjoyed the hot tub. Clean towel were always available. This hotel seemed to book a lot of school trips, with teenagers at the pool at night and all gathering for breakfast at the same time, however during our stay the teens were well mannered. Breakfast starts at 6:30, great for us since we were able to get into IOA at 7:00. At this time the breakfast area was uncrowded, however the area seemed too small when the bus loads all descended later in the morning. The breakfast area was clean and well stocked with items that included make your own waffles, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, sausage, biscuits, donuts, fresh fruit ( bananas, apples, oranges) bread for toast, cereal, oatmeal. Something for everyone although the food seemed to be of low quality, the plastic cutlery weak and the layout of the breakfast area created bottlenecks (the slowest toaster anywhere!!).

Likewise, the complimentary breakfast was basic, but adequate (waffles, bagels, small doughnuts and cereal). The pool is big enough for a splash around on the early return days. If there's complaints to be made, first, it's that the 'fitness centre' equipment was a bit flimsy, but two days into the holiday the diet was blown and I was getting plenty of exercise walking around the parks! Second the lack of in-room safe was a nuisance, but there's safe boxes at reception that are free.

Best tip for british travellers is to book your tickets for parks before you go, cheaper and easier to plan your trip. Rooms were always cleaned to perfection and we made the most of our evenings out. Universal boardwalk is great for evenings and cost about 5 bucks to get there in a taxi if you want some drinks.

We booked it whilst it was a Marriot hotel and it changed ownership before our arrival. I was a little worried about this but need not have been. We Stayed in a Disney hotel last year and were very pleased with that but for half the price the Quality Inn and Suites proved such value for money. My only fault would be the noisy air conditioning. We couldn't sleep with it on and it was a little too warm with it turned off. Other than that we were totally pleased with our stay. The hotel is not posh but everything is in good working order, clean and tidy and the staff are friendly and do an excellent job. Being on Canada Drive is a plus as it's very quiet for sleeping and only a 5 min walk to International Drive over a grassed area along side the hotel. Use the I-Ride Trolley to get everywhere. No need for a car as a 2 week ticket only cost 17 dollars and you can use it for your whole stay as many times as you like! The hotel has a shuttle to Universal Studios at 8.10 am and 2 return journeys that change times each month...ours were 7.00pm and 8.25pm. If you want to go at different times you can get the I- Ride to Wet & Wild, cross the road and walk over the bridge and you are at the Bus and Taxi rank. This walk takes 10-15 mins on a big path on a flat road, it's easy. The I- Ride starts at 8.00am and finishes at 10.30pm and goes to the Premium outlets, north and south. You can also get to Seaworld and Aquatica plus so many shops and places to eat. The driver will tell you which stop to get off if you want to catch a link bus to Disney World, I think it was stop 29. So no need to pay car hire costs, insurance, petrol and parking fees...it's a brilliant service and the wait is never more than 20 mins. Sometimes you may have to stand. Back to the hotel now!!!!! Our room was quite plain but comfortable and well equipped. It was all in perfect working order and cleaned every day to a good standard. Flat screen TV, Coffee maker, Ironing board and Iron, Toiletries plus plenty of room and 2 lovely big beds that were really nice to sleep on. The breakfast was well organized and plentiful. There were cereals, juices, mini doughnuts and muffins, bread, bagels, cream cheese, jams, cold boiled eggs, biscuits and sausage gravy, yogurts, bananas, apples, oranges and make your own waffles and syrup. There was also a microwave oven and 2 toasters. Tea, Coffee and Hot Chocolate were available all day in the breakfast room. Safety deposit boxes were free of charge in the reception. 2 computers were also free of charge by the reception area. There was also a laundry room which we did not use. The pool and garden area were always very clean and had a nicely heated pool and a very warm hot tub. Enough sun beds for everyone and clean towels by the gate. It was nice and relaxed by the pool as hardly anyone used it and you could nip in and get a Coffee as and when you wanted one. A few trees and plants around the hotel and pool but not many. The staff were always polite and cheerful and ready to help with any questions, couldn't fault them. If on a budget or not, this hotel is a great choice. If you want to spend double then go to the Port Orleans as we did last year. We got what we paid for at both hotels and would recommend.

Given room key and off we went - King Suite, room 307, 3rd floor, view towards Pirates Dinner. First thing we noticed was the musty smell in the lan1ding, then the musty smell in the room. Next, we checked the sofa bed - not at all good and not useful to sleep on (matress too thin and ripped). Youngest child slept on cusions off sofabed on bedroom floor and eldest shared bed with us. Not ideal, but as the hotel was only somewhere to sleep rather than be entertained, it did. Two TVs in suite but only one used. Breakfast - lots of choice - make your own waffles (my fav), yoghurts, scones (biscuits if you are American), sausage gravy (again - for the Americans), different breads to toast in toasters, cold boiled eggs, mini cakes, two different types of cereal each day, porridge and lots of fruit. Also, milk and juice to drink. Tea/coffeee/hot chocolate available 24/7. Pool good size and each time we used it, we were the only people there so it felt like a private pool! Short cut through grass area gets you to I-Drive. Loads of places to eat - Ponderosa is really good value, just make sure you are hungry - also Chilis, Perkins, McD, BK, Chuck E Cheese (the kids begged us to go there, not my choice), Dennys, Wild Jacks etc. Staff in each eatery very polite - UK take note. I-Ride trolly goes up and down I-Drive, $1.25 for adults and kids under 12 free per paying adult. We went to outlet stores using the I-Ride to make the journey a bit more fun for the kids.

Great choice of TV channels if you fancy a night in if you have little kids or have had a long day in the parks. It cost us $25 in the Amtrak shuttle from Orlando station and in a taxi on the way back it cost us $36 so if you are travelling by Amtrak take the guy's card when he drops you off and arrange for him to take you back. Free shuttle to parks in the mornings leaves at 8.50am and takes about 20 mins as it picks up elsewhere on the way. Tickets for parks and attractions are available from Dave at the Best Western next door. He says he gives you best prices but we did find tickets cheaper on line, however he does give you the actual tickets so you can go right through when you arrive rather than waiting in will call queues or for assitance with a voucher. Taxi back from Universal parks and City Walk costs around $5. Taxi to Sea World cost us around $19 There are so many places to eat within sight of the hotel and great room service provided by a local grill restaraunt. There is a Walgreens on the same lot, a Burger King, Steak House/Bar, Chinese restaraunt and McDonalds across the street.

I got on my phone, pulled up my reservation, showed the description of the room to him and asked if he could get me the manager. He signed, rolled his eyes and then got the manager. The manager didn't argue one minute. He knew they were wrong. I was then given the correct room, but it was the furthest from the elevator and I had mentioned in my reservation that due to being sick I needed something near the elevator. LOL, I guess they got me after all, huh? Needless to say I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. It's just sad that people can't read a reservation nor do they care to exert customer service. My reservation was made 3 months in advance, too. So there was no last minute fitting me in. I arrived at 3pm and not once was I rude or hostile. I was too tired and defeated to be anything but listless. The room I received was what I had reserved.

When we arrived, the hotel really presented an abandoned image, signage removed, empty carpark, and skeleton staff. This turned out to be a positive, as the location is very quiet, and there was never any trouble parking. We were kindly upgraded to a suite upon check-in, which gave us more room for our 11 night stay. The halls had a fairly musty smell, but our room smelled fine, it was clean, but quite dated. We had a very noisy air-con unit, and our window could be opened a small amount too. We had a king sized bed, large wardrobe, and large LCD TV in the sleeping area, and a desk, sofa, another LCD and a sound system in the sitting area. The bathroom had a shower and loo, plenty of hot water, and a separate sink is outside, opposite which was a fridge, coffee machine and microwave.

I was on a cruise ship the week prior to arriving Orlando and did not receive notification that the hotel had changed it's name. I drove right by the hotel when I got into town. The second time around, I noticed a small, unlit Fairfield Inn sign on the front wall and figured that must be my hotel. The clerk who assisted me was being trained. The senior agent who was helping him was checking in another guest at the same time. The senior agent advised the junior agent to assign me a ground floor room. I immediately responded that I did not want to be on the ground floor and would like something higher. The senior agent said that would be fine. When the trainee handed me the key, he pointed down the hall and told me that was where I could find room 107. I immediately asked, \"Isn't that on the ground floor?\" \"Yes,\" he replied. \"I just told you I wanted to be above the ground floor.\" \"Oh,\" he responded. \"I'll see if I can move you.\" Eventually, I was moved to the fourth floor. All seemed well until I noticed small black insects jumping around in my white bath tub. I called downstairs and asked the clerk if the hotel was \"pet friendly.\" \"No,\" he replied. \"Well, I think there are fleas in my bathtub.\" \"I'll try to get someone up there to take a look,\" was the response. Within 20 minutes there was a knock on the door. After taking a look at the tub, the clerk said, \"Well, I'm from Arizona and can't really tell you what those things are. I think you should move rooms.\" Another 20 minutes later, I received keys to a room down the hall. I was escorted inside just to make sure there were no fleas in the bathtub. Luckily, there were none. Then I went to turn on the air conditioner -- only to find out that the unit made a grinding and groaning noise for 30 seconds every five minutes. I immediately shut off the air conditioner and opened the window. I called downstairs and told the clerk, \"Look, it's late -- but I want you to know that the air conditioner is broken.\" \"Okay,\" was his response. \"Will you send someone up to check on it -- maybe tomorrow.\" \"Sure.\" \"Are you sure? Are you righting this down,\" \"Sure I am.\" The next morning I stopped a maintenance guy in the hallway and said, \"Excuse me, do you know about my broken air conditioner?\" \"No.\" \"No notes to check on my broken unit?\" \"No.\" I decided to let it go and see if anyone would get to my room by the end of day. (Oh, I did have to tell the housekeeper to put a box of tissue in my room.) I spend the day at Universal Studios and came back later that night. I turned on the air conditioner and to my surprise -- it worked. And no fleas in the tub. And, yes, there's a banner covering the old hotel sign out on the main driveway now.

Our room, a suite, was excellent, and included a fridge and a microwave. We didn't use the latter, but the fridge was most helpful, allowing us to take cheap, cold drinks wherever we went. The hotel location is its most valuable treasure. Less than five minutes to Universal, roughly ten to Seaworld & Discovery Cove, and 15 to the edge of the Disney estate, with a plethora of restaurants and attractions nearby as well (you could throw a stone out of the window and hit Wet & Wild for example). And despite all of that, a peaceful refuge from the hustle and bustle of Orlando, where we enjoyed very peaceful and comfortable sleeps. There were also free shuttles to certain attractions, but we had a car so cannot elaborate on those. Some of Florida's best malls are within a short drive as well, and these were nice to visit in the afternoons, after a morning in the parks, or when it rained (which was seldom). So, could we have been any happier? No, frankly. The hotel was perfect for us, and had everything we needed. Yes it's not a Disney hotel, and doesn't look like it cost a billion dollars to build. But none of that matters as you spend very little time there, and it is excellent as a base for exploring the riches of Orlando. Could you do better? Yeah, I'm sure you could.

Breakfast, which was complimentary, did the job to keep us going and there were a variety of things to choose from. It became a bit boring after two weeks but it was free and filling. I try to be quite health-consious and there were low-fat yoghurts, fruit and bran flakes, but that was about it for healthy food. There were complimentary hot drinks 24 hours a day, which was great! We tried the pool out once, which was nice and clean but way too hot to cool off so we didn't go in again. We upgraded to a suite, which I would highly recommend. The room we had was spacious, we had a fridge which was invaluable (and a microwave, although we didn't use this), a HUGE extremely comfortable bed and a living area. The only thing with our room was the noise coming from everybody's air conditioning units but, saying that, we both slept very well so it wasn't a problem, just a bit of a constant drone. The rooms were spotless and well-cleaned each day. Overall, I would very highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Orlando, it made a great base for our holiday.

Overall, it was. Excellent location, yummy waffles at breakfast, free shuttle to and from Universal, and special perks as a Universal partner hotel like early admission and restaurant discounts. It suited our needs just fine. The hotel was clean and well-staffed. The breakfast bar was always fully-stocked (though they really need to add water to the breakfast beverage choices - just cold water for drinking). Our room was clean, well-lit, quiet and (mostly) comfortable. My only real complaint was about our mattress. It was hard as a rock, bouncy as a trampoline, and I could feel every single spring in it. Most nights I woke up every hour or so as I couldn't get or stay comfortable. A poor night's sleep makes for a very loooooong day on your feet in a theme park. The only night I slept well was our last night there, when I was so exhausted that I could have fallen asleep on a bed of hot lava. The free shuttle is nice, but be aware that it is not continuous - there is one pick-up time in the morning, and one return time in the evening. Moreover, the morning pick-up time does not get you to Islands of Adventure in time for the early admission in the morning, which was one big reason we chose this hotel. During our stay, early admission to Islands of Adventure started at 8 am, but the shuttle pick-up at the hotel wasn't until 8:10 am, meaning you don't arrive at Universal until about 8:30 and you miss out on valuable time during that early admission period. We took a cab at about 7:45 to make sure we arrived at Islands of Adventure in time to take advantage of early admission. Tip: The front desk of the hotel will call a [private cab to take you to Universal, and the ride will cost you $10 one way. But a Mears cab you call yourself will get you there for about $7.50 if you want to save a few bucks. Yes, I would stay here again. Fairfield Inn is a good chain.

We stayed in the same hotel 2 years ago in which time the hotel has changed very little and if I'm being honest the hotel is starting to look like it needs freshening up. Having said this I would still strongly recommend it as when all said and done its a budget hotel and fills all the reqirements you could need from a holiday in Orlando. It is also worth getting a King suite as you get a fridge, lots more space a huge king size bed and 2 T.Vs so no fighting with the kids on what you want to watch (that is if you have any spare time and can find anything worth watching on American T.V!!) The following are the main hotel pros and cons, Pros, Free Breakfast (Will save you loads of money and time). Fridge in King suites (Again if you buy bread and filling from Walgreens will save big $$$). Huge king size bed. Location (only a two minute walk from I-drive and very quiet unlike all the hotels on I-drive which are next to the interstate). Great staff who are always on had to help. Nice pool and hot tub which never seemed busy. Free computer room. Cons, Looking a bit tired. Only 1 free shuttle bus going to Universal. Free drinks that were 24 hrs are now only available at selected times, Computers in computer room are very slow. Breakfast choice has been cutback. Prices in Orlando seem to of gone up a lot and you could end up spending serious money on food so be prepared, Disney is charging $8 - $12 per person for snacks. We packed ourselves up each day. All parks except Seaworld and Aquatica will let you take food in. We used Lynx buses to get round this time and didn't buy I-Ride tickets (Lynx go everywhere the I-Ride does and more beside so another way to save) Getting to Disney on Lynx worked ok but you must get up early to make the most of the day. Get the number 8 or 42 to Seaworld then the 50 to the Transfer centre next to Magic Kingdom you are the able to use Disneys free transport to any Disney park. We found it took at best one and a half hours from I-Drive to Disney parks depending on how well the transfers worked out. Food on I-drive is still good value Ci-Ci's pizza is very cheap ($5.99 Buffet) and there are discount coupons all over for 2 for 1. Chilli's do a 2 main meals and a starter for $20 and the food is very good. I can also recommend Golden Coral ($11.99 Buffet) and Sweet Tomatoes ($10.99 buffet) for value and the food is nice. Outback is the best we found but ribs for 4 will cost around \u00a3100. We flew with Virgin Atlantic on their new Airbus A330-300 from Manchester the entertainment systems are very good (so much better than on the old 747s) Food is a bit better but still plenty of room to improve. To sum up if your going to Orlando and want to be right in the middle of things but want to keep costs down pick the Fairfield Inn but don't expect the Hilton.

When the lady behind the breakfast stand was informed, she shrugged it off and said there was nothing that she could do. All in all- would I book again? I probably will try another hotel where the staff would be more welcoming. Although the staff at this hotel did the basics to keep thins running smoothly, the lack of smile and warmth will not encourage me to return. However, if you re someone who really doesnt mind the lack of warmth, this hotel may be just the one for you.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff and ideally placed\u201d", "Author": "Venturer7", "ReviewID": "UR118576558", "Content": "We stayed for 2 weeks and we were more than happy with our stay. From the moment we arrived the member of staff on shift (Francisco(sorry if I've spelt your name incorrectly!)) was very helpful and made us very welcome. We sorted out our safe box, which are kept behind the hotel reception, and settled into our room. We booked a suite and it came with a seating area, table and office style chair, a large bed a couple of flat screen TV's in the bed and seating area, a microwave, fridge and air conditioning (slightly noisy but very effective). There was also a mini sound system in the room. Everything was clean and tidy and, although slightly worn, still comfortable. There were only a handful of hangers on arrival so a quick word with the maid the following day saw another10 arrive which was plenty. There was a iron and ironing board in the room and the hair dryer was good according to the wife (not much need for it in my case). The breakfast area during our stay was always clean and tidy with staff constantly cleaning the serving areas. The choices were good for us as we are not really fried/cooked breakfast lovers so serial, toast, pastries, yoghurt, bagels, fruit and self cook waffles were ample for us. These came with jams, peanut butter, honey and syrup as required. We always got what we wanted every day and there was always a place to sit either inside or outside. There is also a selection of juices available. We tried the orange, cranberry and apple and all were good. There is also a selection of coffee, tea and hot chocolate available 24x7 which is on a self service basis. This was great for a coffee sat outside after an evening out. The pool area is adequate for a short swim and cooling off. On our visit in September the pool was not crowded and there was plenty of room. Similarly the hot tub was also available. Towels are available from the pool area to use. The gym is really only cardio only and is a little limited for anyone wanting to do any weight training (no weights). The location of the hotel was ideal as there were many restaurants within a walk, i-Ride (more later) or taxi fare away. Our favourite was The Olive Garden which is a good quality Italian chain restaurant. We went to the one on International Drive but there are several around. We also dined at Kobe which is a Japanese Teppanyaki restaurant where the show from the chefs is equal to the food quality. Other restaurants in close proximity are TGI Fridays, Chilli's, Cici's (a bit fast food for me but the rest of our party liked it) and the typical giants are all there such as Mac's, Burger King, Denny's etc... I-Ride proved to be a bit of a struggle. The service was irregular and when they did arrive they were normally full with no chance to get a seat. Several times we abandoned the bus stop and nominated a driver for the car or got a taxi. Next time I would not bother and either go for the taxi or the local Lynx bus service which is scheduled and regular. With regard to the parks the hotel was easily accessible to the Universal theme parks as a bus runs to Universal and Island of Adventures on a daily basis. We had a car so didn't use this service. We spoke to some others in the hotel without a car and they had some difficulty in getting to the Disney side of things. We didn't try this so cannot really verify this. Wet and Wild is a walk away and we had a great time there! Overall we had a great time in Orlando. We did lots of things not normally available to us in the UK such as airboat rides, shooting a .45 calible gun, swimming with dolphins and rays, walking through swamps ( big spiders...!)...the list goes on and on. We can highly recommend this hotel if you want a good quality base to get out there and do things. It is not a luxury hotel but a good place to stay.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, UK", "Title": "\u201cAn ideal base\u201d", "Author": "TinyDancer26", "ReviewID": "UR118539748", "Content": "Stayed for 2 weeks with husband in March 2011.

I usually stay at the Marriott properties closer to Disney in the Lake Buena Vista area. I found an excellent point-saver value at the Fairfield Inn off I-Drive so I decided to take a chance given the Marriott Points value. My first choice of the Marriott Brands for a vacation stay is always the Residence Inn or Spring Hill Suites due to the good hot breakfast. I was not overjoyed at staying at the Fairfield due to the more continental style breakfast as opposed to the hot breakfast. However, I was reading great reviews of the breakfast at the I-Drive location (egg sandwiches and such.). The check-in process was smooth--they identified me as a Platinum member. Front desk staff was always friendly. I did think it was odd that the male front-desk employee frequently had a group of 4-5 ladies (seemed like his cousins or something) standing by the front desk eating ice cream and chatting with him every night. I liked that the hotel had the WSJ out every morning in the lobby. The pool/hot tub area was nice. Nothing fancy (better pool at the Marriott Suites location) but fine. The pool water was WAY too hot--it was like jumping into a bath tub. Not refreshing. The room was great. We had a king suite. The bed was comfortable. We liked the layout--a sitting area plus a bedroom area. It was nice having a fridge and microwave for dinner leftovers. The one thing we did not like about the room was that it felt humid/damp unless we had the AC running 24/7. The hotel was very close to the Universal parks and not as far as we thought from the Disney parks. We took I-4 to the Disney parks and were there in about 15 min. Not bad. There are also some very good restaurants on Sand Lake that are near by. We highly recommend the Orlando Ale House as well for cheap food and drinks that are very delicious. Also, the Chilis (within walking distance) has happy hour all day every day so we had drinks and apps for next to nothing. The main downside to this hotel was the Breakfast, as I had feared. The great egg sandwiches I had heard about on Trip Advisor were no where to be found. If you love carbs for breakfast, the Fairfield Inn breakfast can't be beat. Bagels, Toast, Cereals, Waffles, Danish, Donuts, Fruit. However, my husband and I like to eat protien for breakfast and the best we could do is to put peanut butter on our fruit or waffle and eat a low-fat yogurt. We ended up paying for breakfast several mornings because we don't think carb-loading is a healthy way to start the day. At least the Fairfield Inn in the Marriott Village had hard-boiled eggs--that would be a welcome addition to the breakfast at the I-Drive location. Overall, I prefer the Lake Buena Vista area to the I-Drive area so I do not think I would be staying at the hotel again. However, for the points we paid, we had a great stay and if you are looking for a hotel in the Universal Area you will enjoy staying here.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ks", "Title": "\u201cDecent, inexpensive lodging\u201d", "Author": "ks-bike-rider", "ReviewID": "UR118285561", "Content": "This is a typical Fairfield Inn.

The breakfast area is big and can seat around 60 per time but I suggest getting there early if you dont want to be over crowded! Cereals, fruits, pastries, egg and bacon roll, yoghurt, fruit juices and many more. Enough to get you going for the day as well as save you money on eating out for breakfast. Hotel does a free shuttle to Universal/Islands of Adventure. The pick up times are 6:50 am and 8:00 am and then there are 3 pick up times for return (they are quite late at night though). Just wait in the foyer for the big yellow shuttle bus and jump on. If you dont want to wait till 19:00 for the first pick up back to your hotel you can walk from the shuttle rank accross the bridge (crossing I4) and pick up the I-ride ( red line south) to stop 14 for quickness. We got a 14 unlimited ticket for the I-RIDE for $17 each which was very handy. It takes you to Sea World, Acquatica, Wet n Wild and both the Prime and premium outlets.

At first we were fairly disappointed particularly with the location as the previous hotels we passed seemed far more central and generally looked nicer. When we checked in they took my card details for 'incidentals' and having checked out 4 days ago they have still not taken the hold off my card- so beware of that. We were disappointed with our room purely because of where it was located on the ground floor overlooking a concrete car park. As a result we suffered a bit of noise but not too much. The Air conditioning in the room is superb-if a little noisy and could hinder a good nights sleep! The beds were extremely comfortable and the rooms were kept clean most days. The cleaners did come round rather late (As late as 3-4pm) which was a pain when you wanted to go back to your room after visiting a park etc. The hotel run a courtesy shuttle to Universal which is rather rigid in its times. You can choose to go at 06:30 or approx 8AM and it does not return to pick you up until Half 6 at night. We were fairly fortunaqte to experience fairly fast queue times which meant paying for a taxi to get back- it was not over expensive and saved hanging around for 3 hours or so. The reception were helpful and polite at all times- their convenience store could have done with revising but fine if you wanted a 'soda' or a bottle of water. One major disappointment i felt was the small swimming pool. It was never very busy but in peak times you would struggle to get in!! It was not very deep either but i am just nit picking here. One thing the Hotel could benefit from is a small bar- it would be great to return after an evening out to a bar- because of the location i felt a little cut off at times.

I called them immediatly, so upset about it, and they've managed to calm me down and they tried their best to send me a cab with my camera. When they realized they couldn't do that, they told me they would send it right away back to my home in France, by FedEx. I've received my package quickly and they had taken a great care of it ! My camera was bubblewrapped, put in a box which was also bubblewrapped, and there were a lot of \"Fragile\" stickers everywhere on the box. I don't take such a good care of my camera myself !

My first bad trip advisor recommended stay!!\u201d", "Author": "zaezae", "ReviewID": "UR94613043", "Content": "I don't know how my experience was SO different, but here's an account of how we liked this property. I regularly travel for work and regularly choose Fairfield Inn & Suites properties so I was ecstatic to see this hotel rated so high on trip advisor. I was travelling with my 3 yr old, hubby and 2 sets of grandparents to Orlando for a family vacation. The rate was O.k. at $94.00 per night. Keep in mind this is the major off season for Orlando, so consider that as well. When we arrived to the hotel at around midnight there was someone out front talking on a cell phone. We entered the lobby and there was not a desk attendant. Three people were waiting to make purchases from the 'marketplace' and we needed to check in. Turned out, the guy outside on the phone was the attendant. He was not in any type of uniform, didn't have a name tag or any way to distinguish he was an employee. He kept us waiting while he finished his phone conversation outside and then we waited while he helped all the guests wanting to buy food, THEN he helped us. We weren't able to get rooms on the same floor which was a dissapointment, but that's o.k. I was given room 420 and told there was a crib. My son is 3.5 and very tall. No way did I want or need a crib. He told me that I reserved it (I assured him I didn't) but I did request a fridge. He said he would ask housekeeping to replace the crib with a fridge (which never happened). When we got to the room, my bad feelings were intensified. The room was dank and smelled musty at best. The air condition was running but it didn't seem to do much to cool the room or remove the humidity. The furnishings are so outdated it's laughable and there is NO counter space to speak of. Our room was SO small that with the crib in the room, there was ZERO floor space. This might have been o.k. if we were travelling with an infant, but we didn't even want or need the crib. I made the mistake of sitting in the chair in the room also. It was coated with at least an inch thick of dust and dirt and it smelled awful. Stale smoke more than lingered in the air even though I was assured this was a non-smoking hotel. I called down to inquire about the condition of the room and I was told that all the rooms were the same, but I could get a different one if I wanted. Since it was after midnight and I needed to get my 3 year old to bed, I made a bad decision to stick with that room. I went down to buy a water and the desk attendent proceeded to tell me that he knows the hotel is old. He said that it had been in bankruptcy status until about 1 month ago, basically offerring that as an excuse for the poor state of the property. The bed & mattress were awful. The bedding was so old it was horrible. The bed itself was so terrible it should have been replaced long ago. We all rolled to the middle all night and didn't sleep a wink. It was so soft and lumpy it wasn't even fit for my toddler. The 'breakfast' also left much to be desired. I will compliment them on the hours though, they offer breakfast from 6:30-10am which is pretty generous. This is the only compliment you will find. The breakfast area is crowded making it impossible to walk between tables when they are occupied and it's also across from the 'game room' causign my son to be intrigued by that rather than want to eat. Although the choices to eat left much to be desired. The juice tasted very cheap and the other options were super limited. I would have rather eaten the junk they serve at McDonalds. We quickly decided to check out, even without having another room sequred before we left. The desk attendent encouraged us to try them again next year saying that hopefully they will have been updated by then.

I didn't notice it too much in the hall after our first day there, but the smell lingered in our room the entire length of our stay. Another complaint is that the curtains on the windows are sheer and let in light at night. Our room happened to be opposite a large light in the parking lot behind the building.

Room was big and spacious, 2 good sized double beds, desk with phone and chair, plenty of drawers etc. Bathroom was good sized with shower over bath and toilet. Good space outside the bath with sink, big mirror, hairdyrer and room for cosmetics. First impressions were that the room was clean and perfect for us! Got to say I am not quite sure where a rollaway bed would go! We did not notice any smell at all that others having been referring to. The breakfast is great - milk, orange juice and usually one other (apple or cranberry), loads of cereals (all kelloggs!!), bagels, muffins, bread, toasters (2), fruit, yoghurts, microwave ham and egg sandwiches, pastries and cakes. Really busy during July but we got a table every morning bar one when we sat outside. The free Wifi in the room is a total bonus and it works well. If you don't have a laptop or Ipod with you, there are 2 PC's next to the lobby which give free internet access. If busy, they are limited to 15 mins and you just politely inform whoever is on this that this is the policy. The staff is what makes this hotel what it is. They are very helpful and go out of their way to help you. Chris and Laura on reception are first class and the housekeeping kept our room spotless all holiday! We asked for a fridge when we checked in and were put on a waiting list - we got it delivered to our room the next day!! We had a light bulb out in our room, told Laura, it was fixed within minutes - you can't ask for better than that! The hotel is on Canada Ave, literally mins from International Drive (cut across the grass and wee bridge next to the pub and you come out at Cici's pizza). The road is very quiet and away from the hussle of I-Drive. I don't recalling having to yield (give way) to any car when leaving the hotel. I agree strongly with the other reviewers about the junction of Sand Lake Road and Canada Ave - it is a nightmare!! The drivers are so rude and completely block the road even though they can see you are sitting waiting! Try going right out of the hotel and either go left and left again to go along I-Drive or go right and right and come along Universal Bld and turn left onto Sand Lake Road (both have lights which make it quicker). We hired a car for the 2 weeks and it was great. Go to universal after 6pm as parking is only $3. Recommended shops to go to include Premium Outlets at the top of I-Drive and the Florida Mall. The Mall at Millenia is a bit posh and Prime outlets are not as good as Premium. Restaurants I would recommend are Cici's pizza, ponderosa, olive garden and perkins.

The room was very clean and roomy. We liked the fact that the sink area was outside the bathroom and the bathroom had a continuously running fan. The room had two big TVs, microwave and a refrigerator. We had to be at the Sports Complex early everyday, so the free breakfast from 6:30-10 every morning was a BIG plus for us. The breakfast selection was huge. The breakfast staff was constantly putting out food, wiping down the tables and answering questions for the guest. Had two big flat screen TVs to watch while you ate . I also like the fact that they had Purell hand sanitizer stations around the breakfast area for those who wanted to use them. My husband would say every morning that he didn't se how the hotel made any money with the breakfast that they \"gave away\" every day. When the staff would clean our room everyday (they did a fabulous job) they would leave 3 sets of towels, but we always needed an extra set because we wanted to refresh after having been out in the Florida heat all day, so I would inquire about extra towels before going up to our room and no sooner had we closed the door, house keeping would be knocking with the extra towels! The hotel was very clean, 100% smoke-free. Every morning when we got off the elevator for breakfast there was the USA Today AND The Wall Street Journal stacked for anybody who wanted to take them! A big plus for me since I don't travel with an internet phone or laptop. We stayed on the 2nd floor and never had any issues with noise overhead or anything. We never used the outdoor pool, but did walk by a couple of times and noticed that it looked kind of small. The area where the hotel is located is surrounded by restaurants and shops. The grounds were very well maintained and nicely landscaped. You would always see people out walking. Felt very comfortable in the neighborhood. The only complaint we had with our visit, was that it was often difficult to exit Canada Dr. onto Sand Lake because cars would block the exit and traffic was constantly backed up, but when we got out, we were on our way in no time.

We stayed in this hotel for 3 weeks from middle of April 2010 to mid May 2010, having booked it through Virgin Holidays. Overall I would say this is a good value for money hotel. It is not a 5 star hotel (or even 4 star) so don't stay here if your expecting 4 or 5 star quality. Firstly ALL staff were excellent. e.g. on our first day we were heading out to Denny's for breakfast and stopped at reception to ask if we could have a fridge put in the room. After returning from breakfast (1hr later) they had already put it in the room!! we were astounded how quick they were, and this excellent service was repeated continously throughout the stay. 10/10 for service. I actually found the hotel to be very quiet for the whole 3 weeks. In fact the only time it seemed busy was at breakfast, and still there was no problem getting seated and fed (indeed the breakfasts were an excellent alternative from the numerous diners (they offer cereals, fruit, various pastries, juices, coffees, bagels etc.). It is a help your self service, and therefore whilst it's obviously not the ritz, it is still excellent value therefore I would rate 8/10. Rooms were adequate, providing us with everything we needed (fridge, tv, iron, hair dryer, good shower free wi fi), and the room was clean and tidy (the maids did an excellent job every day). The only MINOR issue I would say would be that there was a slight \"smell\" in the room, which whilst not being aweful, was noticeable every time I stepped into the room, however this was easily remedied by buying an air freshner from the local grocery store, as well as leaving the window open. Rooms were also a good enough standard, and all fixtures and fittings were in an acceptable condition (not brand new, but what do you expect in a hotel on international drive in orlando!!!!!). I would therefore rate the rooms 7/10. I would rate location 10/10 as it is is superbly located just of international drive. We found canada avenue to be a very quiet road, with MINIMAL traffic on, and it felt very safe (we never once saw or heard any trouble at all). Whilst we had a car, we walked to restaurants of an evening (at various times of day/night). TGI is literally 4 minute walk away (excellent), Chillis (excellent food and had bogof drinks) is 7 minute walk away, dennys is 11 minute walk away, bahama breeze is 25 minute walk away, and pointe orlando is 30 minte walk away . There must be another 50+ retaurants easily within 20 minute walk away, but the ones noted are where we enjoyed. We also enjoyed playing mini golf (20mins walk away) and go-karting (10 min walk away). Wet and wild is also 15-20 min walk away. Shuttel bus leaves at 8.30ish which takes you free to islands of adventure/universal and comes back around 6, we didnt use, but we saw people using it on a daily basis without any hassle. It also cost us $8 + $2 tip for a taxi to and from City Walk (MEARS TAXI!!!), again all times of day and night so felt very safe and secure. Hotel had a security guard and porter on when we went past at 12am and 2am and 5am, so always felt that it was a safe environment.. We had the use of a free security depopsit box at reception, there is a cash machine (max withdrawal per day is $200) and small shop to buy some groceries, and as much coffee as you can drink (24 hrs a day). Pool was amply sized with only a hadful of people using it. Finally Pirates dinner is literally right next door so 3 minutes away (although we went and will defintely NOT be going again as once you paid your admission, you then have to buy a \"souvenier\" mug to drink your first alcoholic drink from - COMPLETE joke!!! $14 for 1 drink). Overall I cannot really fault this hotel, both myself and my wife would quite happily stay here again, and would have no issues recommending it anybody else!! Yes we have stayed in better hotels, but for the price range for this is definetly amazing value for money. THIS IS A GREAT HOTEL!!!

I also think that the onsite amenities are good for families (game room with pool table and video games, hotel convenience market, outdoor pool). The breakfast area is gigantic by Fairfield Inn standards so seating wasn't a problem. I did have some trouble getting my desired room choice at check in, because this hotel is a favorite of groups coming to see the Orlando sights. There were several groups there on the night I checked in and various groups came and went over the three nights I stayed at the property. LOTS of kids, of all ages, and yes, they hang out in the hallways. The room I started with was on the first floor (only room available with two beds for that night). The next day I was moved to a higher floor and a quieter end of the hotel, but the room layout was identical. Both rooms were clean but the furnishings, carpet etc. were dated and looked a little worn. Tube tvs. The beds had latex foam mattresses and plenty of pillows, I slept well on nights 2 and 3 (kid noise on night 1). Overall not a bad place, but definitely geared more towards groups and families with kids, so independent travelers might feel overrun by the masses, and the rooms have a \"motel\" kind of feel.

My only real problems with the hotel while we stayed were a early fire scare we had where the building had to be evacuated. Turns out it was nothing so everyone went back up to their rooms. There were also a few summer camps staying at the hotel so the free morning breakfast was very crowded. We decided to visit Universal Studios during our trip, but we weren't driving so we had to rely on cabs everyday. If you're not driving you definitely want to use the Yellow Cab Service. The ride to Universal from the hotel is about $7-$8. All other cab services were trying to charge us $12-$15. There was one in particular called CBC, where we called ahead of time and the dispatcher told us 5 minutes..we ended up waiting 45!

The only con to this hotel that was all the drawers smelled like they had been cleaned with a dirty sponge (they had that nasty moldy smell) and every time housekeeping cleaned, the room stunk of ammonia and we had to leave the window open. We actually switched rooms right when we got there because the first room's dresser drawers smelled moldy. The second room had the same problem, though, so we gave up and dealt with it. Luckily, our room had two queen beds so we slept in one and laid out our clothes on the other. Housekeeping must have thought we were nuts. We complained to the front desk about the odor, so hopefully they'll have changed their cleaning products. Besides the odor, the room was spotless and everything else was great. Everyone I spoke to at the front desk was extremely helpful and really nice. Our last day there, check-out was at 11am, but our plane didn't leave until 6pm. The front desk offered to hold our luggage free of charge so we could enjoy a little more time at the parks before we had to leave. Breakfast was good, a little bit better than standard continental. Plenty of healthy options like fruit along with a nice selection of cereals, oatmeal, danishes, toast, and muffins. There was a small convenience store located in the hotel, which came in very handy for drinks and whatnot. The pool was amazing. It was perfectly heated and spotless.

We overlooked a pond and the pool, and in the distance we could see the roller coasters and spotlights from Universal. There was tea, coffee, and hot chocolate constantly available, with plenty of coupons for nearby restaurant and attractions. CiCi's Pizza was definitely the cheapest place to eat. For two people, it was about $12 for all you can eat pizza, pasta, salad, and drinks. Sweet Tomatoes was nearly as cheap (but much better for you) and just a few blocks away, clocking in at about $14 for two people. When we just wanted to stay in after a long day at the parks, the girl at the front desk was able to recommend several restaurants that delivered to our room. As far as location goes, this hotel was perfect! We didn't rent a car, and I don't think we needed to at all. There are tons of restaurants and attractions within walking distance. It was about a 20 minute walk to Universal, and about a three minute walk across a vacant lot to International Drive. From there, we were able to buy I-Ride passes and take the trolley to Seaworld, Wet and Wild, the shopping outlets, Wonderworks, and all the mini-golf places in the area. The hotel provided a shuttle to Universal that we used a few times, but it was nice to know if we stayed later at a club, the cab ride back was only $6. Cab ride prices (call your own cab, the hotel one costs more)- to Universal: $6 to Orlando Airport (MCO): $35-40 to Disney: $35-40", "Date": "March 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "durham", "Title": "\u201cFANTASTIC\u201d", "Author": "charlienmolly", "ReviewID": "UR59410883", "Content": "We just returned yesterday from this hotel,march 2010.

We stayed in February 2010 for 16 nights and it certainly lived up to all the reviews we'd read on Tripadvisor before we left home. The hotel is in a fantastic location - very close to the I4 so getting to the Disney Parks is a breeze, and it's even closer to Universal (around 15 minutes max). Within a couple of minutes you're right on International Drive with a multitude of places to eat, but even so, it's in such a quiet location. The staff on the desk were very friendly and accommodating. They were extremely helpful and nothing seemed to be too much trouble! You can hire out a safety deposit box from the front desk for the duration of your stay free of charge, which is a bonus. Our room (208) a suite, overlooked the car park and we had no outside noise whatsoever. The room was perfect - a good size with two TVs which kept the kids happy! The sofa bed did have the kids rolling together by morning, but they were so shattered they didn't mind! The room was cleaned to perfection every day, with towels replaced if needed. We asked for an extra blanket for the sofabed and within minutes someone was at the door with one for us. The facilities were great. We didn't check out the pool as the weather was a tad cold, so can't comment on that. There is a laundry with two washing machines $1 a go (4 quarters) - bargain! There are also four dryers which again cost $1. You can buy washing powder in the shop for $1 too. The shop is small but has all the essentials you need. There are complementary copies of USA Today and the Wall Street Journal available every morning in the lobby. There is a gym but we didn't try that out - walking round parks all day was all the exercise we needed. There are also two computers available - free of charge - there is a courtesy limit of 15 minutes use at a time, but you can extend this if no-one else is waiting. Breakfast was a real grab-and-go affair but perfect when you need to get up early and get off to the parks. There was fruit juice - usually orange and apple but sometimes cranberry plus fresh water and milk; a good selection of cereals including oatmeal; several bakery items for toasting such as bread, bagels, muffins and pancakes; breakfast sandwich type things which you heat in the microwave; danish pastries and muffins; fresh fruit. Along with that there is tea and coffee, hot chocolate and a selection of fruit/herbal teas which is available 24/7. There is no problem taking food up to your rooms and we even had a pizza delivered to our room by a local pizzeria recommended by the front desk. When you need a hotel with all the basics, then you honestly cannot find one better.

Sure, it wasn't plush and the view from the window was of a car park, but everything was spotless and well-maintained. There was free wireless throughout the hotel and 2 computers for guests' use, free of charge in the business centre. And breakfast was included! In many US hotels you will pay the cost of a room in this hotel on breakfast alone! My daughter loved helping herself from the buffet which was very well-stocked. Despite other reviewers' advice, personally I'd steer well clear of the Jimmy Dean sandwich! But cereal, breads, pastries, pancakes, yoghurts etc are all plentiful. They don't even mind if you take some bits away to eat later. There is no bar, which is a shame, but we stocked up on beer and wine at the 7/11 and they opened the bottle for us at Reception. The pool is good and clean and the hot tub is great for soaking away the aches and pains of pounding the parks. I was so impressed with what this hotel had to offer for the price that we booked to return for a couple of nights at the end of our trip.

The next room was perfect, clean and very roomy. I saw one review complaining about the free breakfast. Firstly it is free!! Generally hotels in this area are bed only, you have to pay huge amount for breakfast or go out trying to find a breakfast. The breakfast had plenty of choice, fruit juices, cereals, fruit, toast, bagels, pastries, tea and coffee, I mean what more do you want for a FREE breakfast?? This hotel doesn't have a bar but its only 5 mins walk to a TGI Fridays or Chilis on the main international drive. The big advantage of this hotel is that you can walk 5 mins to a bar and then walk back, both of you being able to drink, lovely! I cannot recommend this hotel enough as it was perfect for what we needed, When you go to Orlando you are at the parks all day, so when you come back to our hotel all you want is a clean, good sized room and friendly hotel staff - this is all at the Fairfield. A tip for dining, go further down international drive towards the convention centre and the Castle hotel. There is a small shopping plaza with shops and restaurants. We dined at the Oceanaire seafood restaurant at this plaza. Yes its expensive but sooo worth it, perfect for a romantic meal for two.

Had stayed once before at this end of I Drive and was disappointed. This holiday was booked by friends who travelled with us and I was a bit wary of what to expect. However I was very pleasantly surprised with the standard offered by the Fairfield Inn and Suites. Service from the front of house staff was excellent and very friendly, nothing was a trouble to them and they would spend time chatting with you making you feel very welcome. The housekeeping staff we had were particularly good and paid attention to detail. Bed linen was changed on request as were the bath towels. One maid in particular who we spoke with noticed my wife was having trouble with blisters on her heel from wearing new shoes. The next day upon returning to our room she had left out an assortment of plasters and a bottle of water for my wife, very thoughtful. It was the small touches of the fanned out the box of tissues left on our bed that made you know that you were being taken care of by professional staff. Access to the hotel was secure and you were comfortable about safety. The rooms themselves were clean and fresh and bright. The pool was small but never crowded, clean and warm water was inviting for the rest days. The hot tub was just that, 105F and you are recommended not to spend more that 15 minutes at a time in it an a clock was positioned conveniently for you to keep an eye on your time. Towels were provided free at the pool deck which enabled you to dry off before coming back into the lobby area. The dining area for breakfast was kept clean and coffee was available 24hrs. Breakfast ranged from toast, boiled eggs, pancakes / waffles syrup, yogurts and fresh fruit. A good selection but if having a longer stay might get a bit monotonous and a visit to a local Dennys etc will be a welcome change. Free parking and an ideal location made getting about by care easy. Bus service was available to and from the parks, however one family who we talked to ended up hiring a car locally as the journey took an hour because of stops at other hotels. Our journey by car took 10 min to Universal parking lot. If I were staying at the north end of I Drive I would not hesitate in going back to the Fairfiled. I think that the two star should be at least 3 or 3.5 My reason for not going to 4 is the lack of a bar / lounge or full restaurant. I can understand why there is not bar as it maintained a quite environment and there was no rowdiness, however a place to have a drink or two and chat with friends would have been nice as our normal day would be up early and quite busy and it would be normal for most nights to be back by 9pm to relax in our room and watch some local TV news of which there is plenty.

If you are getting a flex ticket, then the location is ideal, all the parks (except busch gardens on the flex plus) are within 15mins drive of the hotel and very easy to get to, there is also a wallmart near by which is amazing for souvenirs and snacks. If anyone is considering driving and thinking about hiring a Sat Nav, we actually found it worked out cheaper for us to purchase a map upgrade (\u00a350) for our own unit instead of hiring one from the hire car company which cost a great deal more.

We had a car and location wise the place is ideal. You're 10 minutes drive to Seaworld and less than 5 minutes from the I-4 (exit 74A) which gets you to Disneyworld in about 20 mins(exit 67 is best). The hotel is served by a free shuttle bus to universal which leaves at 08:20,9:20,10:20 each morning and returns at 4:10 and 7:20 each day. On thurs,fri,sat they do extra late buses for citywalk. My recommendations is to use the bus to get there and get a cab back(opposite where the bus drops you) from the rank. Cost us just $8 with tip to get back as the bus on the way back becomes a bit of a free for all (some people can't or don't queue). The pool was nearly empty for our 2 week stay and the deep end was just 5 feet so okay if you're not a good swimmer(like me). Also loads of free beds for sunbathing(if you get time !). Free breakfast is good with several cereals,fruit,danish,toast and jimmy dean muffins which i would not recommend unless you like soggy muffins. Free tea and coffee all day. Always tables available. The front desk changes up to $100 trav cheques a day and can supply a free box/safe for all your valuables on request which is held under the front desk. They are mega helpful and there wasn't a single time where i went to them for help be it directions or whatever that they didn't know the answer. There's a laundry on the ground floor if your towels etc get soaked with the rain showers..costs just 1 dollar for 30 minutes drying cycle.There's 2 pc's on the ground floor also with free internet access 24 hours a day.. Now the room..shower ,bed,cleanliness,TV,air con all excellent but the one thing that let it all down was the storage. For four of us. 2 adults and 2 teenagers for 2 weeks we had a open clothes rail about 3 feet long and 4 large drawers and one small bedside drawer. Because of this our room resembled a chinese laundry for the 2 weeks. I know it's 2 star but there was a desk and seat in the corner which could be taken out and replaced by a cupboard for clothes,this would be far more practical. So as we could have a drink we tried a few restaurants we could walk to in the area and the best by far was chilli's,Cici's pizza was good for the money..buffet pizza for 4 with drinks $28 !!! Ponderosa is good for the money too but is like eating in a canteen with no atmosphere. TGI's was okay,and the chinese buffet was okay too. International Drive is a bit tacky with loads of tourist shops which gave it a slight downmarket feel. A couple of nights we got some cans and bottles of wine and crisps and sat outside near the pool area and had a drink. I though they might stop us but nothing was said. Did that twice after epcot and magic kingdom where we got back just before midnight...i think that's it !! ooh..don't forget to tip the maid EVERY day.

I asked her what she meant and she felt the room smelled damp and musty....I did not notice. I went back to the room to check it out and snapped some photos of the sofabed and have no idea whether the spots on the underside of the mattress are mold spots or not. It is interesting to note that the spots largely occur where shiny metal touches the bottom of the mattress, particularly over the springs and over the spot in the middle where two cross rods add support. My thought is that perhaps the springs and rods have a higher chance of condensing room humidity vapor, in which case the black marks may be mold or rust stains.....not sure? In any case, on checkout, I showed a photo to the front desk staffer and told her about what we found. She apologized and said she would have the room checked out.

I can now see why it is such a favourite. It is in a perfect location, situated just slightly back from International Drive so no noise and heavy traffic. As it is in the middle of International Drive it is a great location for both the more upscale end and the cheap and cheerful!! We also found that Sand Lake road that the hotel is off is fab because one way you get straight onto the motorway to Disney & the other way takes you to the Florida Mall. When we arrived at the hotel we were told that they did not have any notice of our booking. This immediately worried us but they sorted it in a matter of minutes (Virgin had confirmed our booking with them as being for May not March!!!) We had a lovely spacious room on the 4th floor whch was plenty big enough for two of us with two double beds, a comfy chair, desk and chair, t.v, drawers & hanger space. The bathroom was a fair size and was nice as the basin was in a separate vanity area so two people could get ready at the same time. The only thing I didn't really like was the fact that although there is a covering on the windows and net curtains so you can't see in the actual curtains were only there for display & did not meet in the middle. I am a heavy sleeper so it didn't bother me but some people may find this disturbing. The facilities at the hotel were also brilliant. We were able to store all our valuables (phone, passport, money etc) in the storage boxes at the front desk. I was a bit unsure at first about not having a safe in my room, but it worked out really well. We just asked at the desk for our stuff as we were going out for the day so we knew to take what we needed. The staff were all really helpful, and as you have the only key to the safe & they ask for your signature to open it I felt everything was secure. We used the business suite for the internet most days just to check up on stuff. You get 15 mins per session which we found plently long enough. Sometimes it was busy but we just went back when we felt it would be quieter. We also used the pool area once - plenty of loungers, clean towels (we used our own as we didn't relise these were avaiable) & the pool itself ws lovely and clean & warm. We also bought a few bits in the hotel shop when we couldn't be bothered to walk to international drve (it's not that far we were being lazy!!) which we found wasn't too badly priced. We also used the free shuttle to Universal which was great (especially as on a Thurs-Sat night it comes back late from City Walk) we didn't have to worry about parking and could also get our bearings of the area whilst on the bus. Coming back it was running a little bit late but we had no other plans so that was fine. The breakfast was great for a freebie. Plenty of choice. I mainly stuck to cinamon buns or bagels, but there were plently of cereals, pastries, etc to keep you going. Although the breakfast area is relatively small there were always tables available with some people choosing to sit in the pool area to eat. I was very impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel, the rooms were immaculately clean even when we'd dumped our shopping bags everywhere the cleaned round them so it didn't look like a bomb hit the place!!!! We had fresh towels most days & you can leave a sign on the bed telling the maids when you'd like your linen changing!!!

Here's how I would breakdown this property: Location- International Drive can get pretty congested with traffic but the location is very convienent to the all the parks, shopping and dinning. I always have a rental car so I can't comment on the park shuttles from this property although I did see several guests returning & leaving on shuttles through out the day. Rooms- Hotels in Orlando are used & abused since they are booked nearly year round. I imagine it's difficult to keep any property looking brand new. These rooms were clean but could use some updating in the decor. Overall room size was generous with a sitting area and desk. Bathroom was tiny and showed some wear & tear. Staff & Other Stuff- Free breakfast is great and such a money saver - especially in a town where everything is so over priced. Staff was really helpful and gracious with all my business requests. Free Wi-fi (that actually works) is always important to a business traveler. The property grounds aren't especially scenic or resorty but there is a pool on site. Overall, you can do a lot worse in Orlando. It's a good value - especially when contrasted to the Disney properties which are insanely over priced. Would I stay there again - maybe. Will it be tops on my list for the next trip to Orlando - probably not.

The Room was clean and even had a small microwave and fridge and 2 televisions and had plenty of storage space for luggage and all the shopping ! The free breakfast is a bonus and very convenient and sets you up for the day, they have free coffee available all day also in the lobby. Breakfast is buffet style with Tea, Coffee juices, porridge, and a good selection of rolls, muffins, breads for toast, fruit, yogurts, danishes and cereals, We never used the pool as we spent a lot of our time in nearby Wet and Wild ( 3 mins drive 15 mins walk) but it was a decent size, very clean and plenty of sun beds. The location is very good for Universal, Islands of Adventure, City Walk and Wet and Wild as they are so close and the free shuttle buses (3 in morning and 3 back in afternoon/evening are well recommended - because its $12 to park in Universal and $10 in Wet and Wild. A taxi only cost us $8 back early one afternoon. There are a great selection of restaurants and shops nearby on i Drive and the Prime Shopping outlets are about 3 miles away, Florida Mall about 4 miles away down Sand Lake Rd and Premium outlets 9 miles away so location could not be better. We didn't do Disney this time but there are shuttles there from the hotel too but its further than Universal. Hotel staff ,as previousy reported by TA guests, are very customer service orientated and nothing is a problem, Laura on reception was particluarily good !! We used the Orlando Magic Card, downloaded from the internet ,and got a great discount off the room rate. Keep the card to get the coupon books in the shopping malls and some discounts off attractions. See the Orlando visitors website. Shopping is good, though I noticed that you have to do a bit of homework to maximse bargains, (10% if you spend $100 in Tommy, $25 off when you spend $125 in Polo in Premium outlets. etc) Many shops had \"buy one, get one half price\", so dont rush in and buy straight away do some planning there is plenty of good value to be had.

The pool was kept bath-water warm and was an excellent way to wind down at the end of a day, in preparation for our flights the next day. I habitually pick Marriott brand hotels over others because of the consistent quality and amenities they provide, no matter where you are travelling. The Fairfield Inn Orlando was no exception. It helps to start the day off with something to eat at the hotel breakfast area, instead of getting to a restaurant, ordering, eating, paying, it's almost noon and half a day wasted. The breakfast area was large and had plenty of tables. The variety of hot and cold breakfast items is good and there were healthier options available to the regular sugary pastries and cereals.

The breakfast area is large with a good selection of items - no food is prepared for you but toasters and microwaves get the job done. The staff is friendly and accomodating, and the servers working the breakfast lounge kept it clean and well-stocked - quite the feat considering the crowd a couple mornings.

The cons - I guess that in spite of the other reviewers mentioning the same thing I'm going to the placement of this hotel as #1 in Orlando (with seemingly millions of competitors!) got my wife and I's hopes up a bit too high - not the hotel's fault assuredly. The lobby is sort of a pass through to the elevator banks and really needs some updating (not dirty, but needs some style). The hallways are kind of dank (is that a word?) and narrow, and the rooms are average and actually well priced for what you get - again the #1 rating had me picturing a beautiful suite. The A/C comes from a large window unit that does the job but which has to noisily cycle on and off to do it - no central A/C. The bathroom consists of a toilet and shower in a small room that is separate from the sink - good for having multiple people be able to get ready at the same time, but each area seems small when cut in half, so to speak.

I'll give you first the positive. The location is very good: on a quiet neighbourhood with a short distance to any mall and to the parks. Also, the breakfast was really good, lot of items to choose from and not crowded in the breakfast room. Free parking was also nice and easy. Service was also good (save as to the pool thing explaned below). Then the negatives/averages. The room was at most average. The air-conditioning was oldfashioned and super noisy (not possible to sleep if it is on) and it did not really work too good, at least with hot air. The windows were thin and it was a cold week in Orlando, so not very nice that the heating did not work properly. There should at least be more blankets in the rooms if the heating does not work! Then one huge huge issue, which could be an asset for the hotel but during our stay it definitely was not: the pool! They have an ok pool with a nice whirlpool. But: the second AND the third day of our stay, the whole pool area is closed!! And due to cleaning they said, as if, how can it take whole two days to clean one small pool area?? That was really bad service to the customers, I have to say. I was so irritated because you really do need the pool relaxation after those long days at the parks. They should really understand that MOST of their customers for sure come to Orlando to do the parks and some serious shopping, and you are tired after all that - so if I have booked a hotel with a pool, I expect to have the pool working at least two days out of three! They did say that we could use the pool of some close-by hotel, but leaving to another hotel to just use the pool would really frustrate the purpose of a relaxing pool experience, wouldn't it? But like said, an ok hotel, even could be nice if the pool and the air-conditioning machine would be working, but still no Tripadvisor #1. Ps. I took the advice from some people here on Tripadvisor, and did not take the hotel shuttle but drove the car to Universal. That a a good choise I think, very fast but of course it cost USD 15 to park at Universal.", "Date": "December 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cwmbran", "Title": "\u201cLoved this hotel\u201d", "Author": "sue13Cwmbran", "ReviewID": "UR22489212", "Content": "Eleven of us stayed at Fairfield in a mixed group of adults, teenagers and very young children.

The location was perfect - about 7 mins walk to I drive and the I ride trolley stop, with plenty of excellent restaurants (particularly Chilis - was fab)! We had a suite which was huge, there were two of us and it was great. Having a separate seating area was good, although it wasn't used much as we were too busy at the parks. The room was always clean, and the cleaning staff were very friendly. The breakfast was really good, a perfect start to the day (we moved to a Disney hotel for the last 9 days of our stay, and missed the ease of having breakfast included). The transport to Universal, Seaworld etc was good and generally on time. A tip - make sure you plan the night before the times of shuttles, as there are only 2 or 3 in the morning. Coming back from the parks worked well with the shuttles, but we did get taxis a few times - it never cost more than $10 from Universal including tip, so was not expensive, and was a bit more convenient. We did not have a car for this trip, and never felt that we were missing out - the hotels location is very convenient, and we really liked the free shuttles and easy walk to the I ride shuttle. I think it worked as we were two adults, but I would suggest a car if you have children, just for convenience and to avoid unnecessary waiting. Overall, I loved this hotel and will definately stay here again on my next trip to Orlando.

I was very intrigued how this hotel out ranked all these mega resorts with all the bells and whistles. So first opportunity being from Miami I took it. I went on line, straight to the Marriott web sight and booked a suite for $99. I booked this room for 3 nights. At first I thought this is not a big entrance. Than I thought to my self this is not a big hotel. Once I got in the room, I was like this is not the biggest suite I\u2019ve been in. I kept thinking to my self why is this number one. Than little by little it all sank in. First the location, it is perfect right off international drive, same street as the big McDonalds. You could get to any park easily and quickly, as well as all the attractions on international. Than the hotel, small but clean well maintained, with great service. Finally the room, clean moderately spacious separated seating area with its own TV and fridge and microwave, as well as a small desk or eating table. So while this is not the most luxurious hotel, the biggest hotel, the resort on a park hotel; it is vary much the most convenient. This hotel separates it\u2019s self from the rest, by doing very simple but very effective things. One great service, on Friday I went out to eat at Le Coq Au Vin, another well deserved number 1. While passing the lobby I asked for directions and they went online and printed me out directions. They made that little extra effort that made a difference to me. Two they maintain the property clean and friendly. Finally the rooms clean with the right amenities. This is a hotel that has it right. You don\u2019t have to be a multi million dollar resort with mega pools and 1000 floors to be the most desired property. All you have to do is give your best with service maintained and give the most at the most competitive pricing. All though it hotel has no extra, it is an excellent value there for thats my rating.

We chose this because it was great value, right round the corner from international drive and because of it's great reviews and it did not disappoint! The Breakfast was spot on, there were pastries, muffins, juice, hot beverages, bagels, toast, cereal, yoghurts, hot sandwiches, fruit - all you would expect from a continental breakfast and more! There are also hot beverages available free of charge 24/7. The staff were outstanding, they were always happy to help. Whilst I was abroad I had to forward some documents to work but the printer ran out of ink (this is the computer and printer that are free to use and come in very useful, there is also free wireless for those with laptops!) so i informed reception and they let me use their printer and they even faxed over 30 sheets to the UK free of charge! I was very impressed with how amazing the service was. If a taxi is needed then they will order this for you once you've given them the necessary information. As we were in Orlando we didn't spend much free time in the hotel so didn't use the pool but what we saw of it was fine, there was a reasonably sized gym and a jacuzzi! International Drive is about 10 mins away but if you cut across the field directly opposite the hotel it cuts your time in half (you will come out by O'Shucks pub on International Drive). The Bus service from the hotel to the parks was a brilliant thing to have, although they do not go to Disney but this was not a problem for us as we stayed in Disney for 6 nights before arriving at this hotel as we are not old enough to rent a car! However, even if you miss the complimentary bus service, the I-Ride is only round the corner and that will take you to seaworld, aquatica, universal etc. Be sure to pick up the masses of coupon books round the corner from reception, they will save you some money. There is also a little shop in the lobby area for snacks and drinks and small souveneirs etc and next door to it there is a games room with different arcade machines! The rooms were reasonably sized, for just two of us there was plenty of room. The Air-Conditioning can be a bit noisy but you get use to it and I'd rather have it there and noisy than not there at all!!

During our stay we had a number of school parties staying for a few days as their bands play at Universal as part of parades, but I can say that there was no extra noise and the teenagers where always polite and not rowdy. Breakfast had a good variety of foods from Cereal to Muffins and even a microwavable bacon/egg /cheese sandwich. Hot Drinks are avaliable at all times of day. The swimming pool was good with towels avaliable all day, we even took these to the water parks with us and then just put them in the dirty bin on our return. We had a standard room with a rollaway bed although this made things a ittle tight at night it was better for us as our children are a boy and girl, but stands up during daytime taking up little space. New soap, shampoo and conditioners where left every day (Pantene) so no need to take own. I ride trolley has many stops near hotel on International drive, we did not use shuttle buses as we had own car most of holiday but used trolley to go to Seaworld to save on parking charges, we had no or little wait at either end of day.

The hotel also offers a free continental buffet breakfast with a very large selection of items to choose from. We could have chosen a different combination of items for breakfast on every morning of our two week stay! Although breakfast runs until 10am, we found that it was best to head down before 7:30 to avoid the crowds.

The blanket, which was folded up in a plastic bag with the sheets, had many hairs on it. EWWWWW! I could understand one or maybe two, but this blanket had not been laundered in a while!!!

But out of all the things that I did like there was one thing that I thought could have been better, and that would be the shuttle bus that the hotel offers. Yea, they offer a shuttle, but that shuttle is also shared with a few other hotels in the area. It has like two departures in the morning and like two returns in the evening, but the thing with sharing the shuttle with the others is that it's first comes, first serves and by the time it gets to the Fairfield theres only a few seats left and people are trying to push their way to the front of the line so they can get the remaining seats. After the first day or two my family learned that it was much easier to take a taxi to the parks.

In the past its been Ponderosa buffet every day but not this time, the hotel breakfast was more than adequate which meant the credit card barely got used for meals.

Whether it was broken or someone didn't turn the heater on, by Sunday the pool felt like it was in the 90's! So, we, especially being from Hamburg, NY, soaked up some sun, mostly by ourselves. We ventured to Universal one day (10 minutes away), Disney (20 minutes) and Seaworld(15 minutes), so this is very convenient to the theme parks. It is also less than a block from International Dr. and a block and a half from an I-4 interchange. We saw mostly business travelers, but there is no reason a family can't enjoy the clean, convenient setting.", "Date": "November 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood Value Seaworld Packages\u201d", "Author": "momtravelswith3", "ReviewID": "UR6157520", "Content": "We stayed here on our first night in Orlando. We chose this hotel as we wanted to visit Seaworld and they offered a package with tickets and free shuttle service. This created a good value considering 1 day passes alone are $50/pp. The front desk agent was very kind and checked us in quickly. I had called ahead as we were arriving very late and wanted to be sure our room would not be given away, at this time I requested a roll-away be put into our room. The cot was there and ready when we got to the room. The shuttle service is only 1/day which I think would be better to have 2 departures and 2 returns for those who choose not to spend the full day at SeaWorld. We did not use the shuttle as we slept in due to late arrival. The breakfast was really good, with muffuns, danishes, bagels, yogurt, juices and microwavable egg biscuits. We did have some problems with our passes at Seworld, they were declined as 'barcode not found' this caused us to hold up the line and was a little upsetting. We were able to enter the park however after some discussion. I have emailed this concern to Marriott and they said they will pass the concern onto the hotel. The hotel stored luggage for the day for other members in our party and were very accomodating to any special requests. I would stay here again if there was a package special, but there are so many hotels to choose from in the I-Drive area that I would consider elsewhere if I found a better deal.", "Date": "November 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff, solid lodging choice...\u201d", "Author": "RueStPeter718", "ReviewID": "UR5922031", "Content": "Stayed here for a night before checking in on Disney property. I try to base my 'bubble' ratings upon expectations when booking a property vs. actual experience. It's not the Ritz, but for the going rates, you really can't beat the amenities and service. Our room was ready upon arrival, and our floor/level request met. The room seemed VERY clean compared with so many in Orlando. Our only complaint might be the carpet in the corridors themselves needed to be replaced. But this is Orlando, and they no doubt take a beating. I'd much prefer the carpet in my ROOM be nice..and it was! Breakfast was plenty and well stocked. OJ ran out as I was pouring, and the fellas working were right on it. Breakfast was early, but that didn't bother us--we're early risers. I also suspect this might help keep some of the crowds down. We grabbed ours and headed back to the room. The game room is pretty nice for a lodging of this rating/size! Also liked the idea of the 'terrace' seating between the pool and breakfast area. The workout room...well, it's nice they even offer one. There were towels supplied and a TV, and I believe a water fountain (believe it or not, I was in a \"4 Diamond\" lodging in Vegas this summer with a gorgeous workout facitlity--but with NO water fountain...???). The equipment at the Fairfield consisted of 5 or 6 cardio machines. For me personally, I KNOW I'm gonna get my cardio in when I'm in Orlando. But again, it's a nice gesture. I put the room on the 'wrong' card (Marriott is running a point special with another). Front desk staff was quick to switch it out for me. Bill was under my door early the next morning, and CORRECT. Disney still ties your bill to your door handle on the day of departure, which I find simply GOOFY (every pun intended) in this day and age of ID theft/concerns. Hotel is in a good/quiet, if somewhat removed, location. A right onto Sand Lake, and then a few minutes east to Universal or west to Disney. A note form a native Floridian (now transplanted to the bitter cold): I personally tend to skip any restaurant with a 'running digital ticker' on their sign. To me, it just screams 'tourist trap'. Such is Fish Bones, on the corner as you turn into the hotel. If you have a car, come out to Sand Lake and make a right. Go under I4 and keep traveling north for appx a mile or two (I believe it is in the 7300 block). On your left will be a place: BONE FISH. Not to be missed, full of locals; the food is wonderful, the atmosphere hip, and the prices beyond fair (about half of Fish Bones). Let me clarify: the food may be great at Fish Bones; I don't know. What I DO know is that the food IS fabulous at Bone Fish, and the prices ARE half that of Fish Bones. Some other nice dinner ideas: Vito's on I-Drive for steak, Cafe Tu Tu Tangos, I-Drive, for tapas (and cool atmosphere!), and The Flying Fish on Disney's Boardwalk. Bottom line, if you're in need of solid, clean, and reasonable lodgings, that are just a tad above basic, check out the Fairfield International.

There was ample parking which was close to the reception area and elevators. The breakfast was very healthy which included yogurt, cereal, fruit, juice, bagels, and muffins. Canada Ave. is located 1 block south of International Drive. Its difficult to make a left turn off of Sand Lake Road. due to the traffic. The hotel is also accessible from Universal Dr. and Carrier St. Coming from the airport, you can bypass the freeway and Interantional Drive by taking McCoy Rd.(off of 528) to Sand Lake Road to Canada Ave. If driving you also pass the Florida Mall in route. This hotel is located close to the Universal Studios, several Walgreens, the Outlet Malls, and several fast food and nicer restaruants. On Sand Lake there is a Popeyes and a Chic-a-fil. There is also a Ruth Chris and a Roys. The Highway 4 is accessible from Sand Lake Road and leads West to the Disney theme parks and East to the Millenia Mall (4 exits).
