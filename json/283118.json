We picked the property because we love Place St. Sulpice and the area in general. If you like the wide blvds and the big stores over the river in the 1st or god forbid the 2nd, then you should stay at one of the big hotels over there. But if you prefer the Jardin du Luxembourg and the windy streets and beautiful walks and shops of the 6th and 5th, stay here. The hotel is perfect; we had one of the \"tradition\" rooms, which is slightly larger than their smallest, and has a separate toilet and shower. But not only is the general location wonderful--the specific is, in my opinion, the best in the area. Alighting on and returning to the square each time you leave or come back to the hotel is such a joy. If you love the organ at St. Sulpice, you can stop in multiple times per day to hear it. The fountain froze toward the end of our stay and was turned off, but the square is still always beautiful and spacious. The cafe across the way is perfect, always, for toast and espresso in the morning or a glass of wine late afternoon. The hotel staff were all extremely professional, personable and kind. Our room was deeply quiet and satisfying, with good sheets, towels, pillows and fantastic European hardware in the bathroom (shower only, but what a heavenly shower). The design of the hotel is elegant, not futzy and it is beautifully maintained. I hope that the property continues to maintain its high standards for staffing and upkeep. We hope to return soon.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lebanon", "Title": "\u201cTiny Paris\u201d", "Author": "Langoustine", "ReviewID": "UR121862229", "Content": "I stayed at the Recamier this summer, and i absolutely loved it.

I always feel that staying in a big expensive hotels in Paris defeats the purpose of the city.here i felt secure, i felt at reach, and i was well serviced.

Because of the news we'd been hearing (travelers without taxis to take them to/from the airports, insanely crowded metro stations, and worse - potentially violent demonstrations), we were hesitant about coming on the date we had set, and asked Hotel Recamier for a little leeway to make up our minds about when to come. We did not intend to cancel our trip, merely to postpone our check-in date. We had asked for them to give us until the night before our intended arrival to let them know about whether we were going to postpone or not (most hotels will allow 24hours notice without penalty) - and we were flat-out refused. Admittedly, giving them less than a day's notice would be pushing it, but we were open to a little negotiation - perhaps the day before. Amidst all the chaos, we had thought that they would at least give us a little slack, but they were unbending and insisted on charging us a penalty (one night's stay) for informing them less than 3 days before our intended arrival (as per their policy). In the end, rather than pay for an extra night that we didn't stay for, we decided to cancel the trip altogether. If they were a little more accommodating, we would have at least gone for the week (we were originally going to stay 9 days!), but because they were so insistent on charging us the penalty, we decided not to give them our business. They might have charged me one night's stay now as a penalty, but if they had been a little more flexible, they'd have earned the income of at least a 5 night stay instead.

The rooms are small, but that's the case in Paris. The air conditioning and free wifi made up for that. The hotel has recently undergone a major renovation and the decor is amazing. Very modern, but still comfortable.

Having stayed at a number of different hotels in Paris, this is the first one that I would happily return to. The rooms are lovely with lots of amenities (including an ipod docking station), wonderful sheets and pillows and a very comfortable bed. The hotel is very well-located in the heart of St. Germain but it was also very quiet and we slept very well. We were on the top floor in one of the larger rooms (which I highly recommend). The bathroom was lovely too. I would recommend the buffet breakfast with the croissants, pain au chocolat, cafe au lait, fruit, yogurt and cereal. We can't wait to return!!!

With only twenty four rooms, four to each floor, the hotel barely feels like a hotel, more like a private club. There is a single reception desk tucked away just inside the entry. Down a short hallway is a stylized lounge room with French doors that open to a small inner courtyard covered patio. The overall look is modern, yet elegant. These areas are used for breakfast, and the afternoon complementary coffee and cake. There is also a computer available here for guests to use. We stayed in a club room which was decent in size and well appointed. It had a view of St. Sulpice through the front French doors. What was nice about this room was that there was a second set of French doors overlooking the small inner courtyard, and a third set in the bathroom. The room was stylish and comfortable with good use of fabrics and earth tones. In addition to a desk with chair, there was a separate comfortable leather chair and table. The large closet area in the entry corridor provided a good amount of storage space. There was also a refrigerator in the closet area that had room for a few personal items such as water bottles. The bathroom was a good size with a large tub/shower combination. Although the club rooms cost a fair amount of money more then other rooms, we felt it was well worth it, especially since some other reviews have stated that the rooms in the hotel are small. There is a cool looking staircase that is open to the room corridors and runs the full height of the building. On each floor is a shelve in the staircase with very interesting and bold pieces of art that helps make you feel like you are staying in a unique and special place. Because the hotel is so small, the staff level is also a little limited. We think some staff members perform multiple tasks. This was not a problem for us, but this is not the type of hotel where lots of staff are running around all over the place. However, if you need them, they are there to help, and are very nice. The hotel is located near vibrant areas of the city, and metro stops are nearby. Perhaps the best advantage of this hotel is that it has been recently totally renovated and it shows. Everything looks very new, upscale, and fresh. We have stayed at several hotels in Paris and this is our new favorite and we will be back. We really were impressed with the condition, style, and location of the hotel. These factors all combined to make this property a very smart choice for a stay in Paris.", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "sydney", "Title": "\u201cExercise care in booking on line\u201d", "Author": "Timetraveller16", "ReviewID": "UR70353530", "Content": "We booked this hotel on-line - admittedly after cancelling but then rebooking and getting email confirmation. When I arrived - after a very long flight - no sign of the booking. Although I was able to stay one night and an effort was made - in a rather desultory way - to find another hotel - the assumption was that it was my fault, until I provided details of the on line confirmation the next day. Although they finally admitted responsibility - it was a poor introduction to a hotel which promised so much. The room itself was fine - nice views over Saint Sulpice and a great bathroom and effective air conditioning. Despite a recent renovation the room was showing signs of wear - lights not functioning. The lounge area was pleasant - quiet, cool and jasmine in flower. Not much of a hotel to stay in for business purposes. WIFI reception was poor and inconsistent. Access to a printer in the lounge was OK. After staying in 4 hotels of 4 star standard in the area in the last year - this one rates behind Villa Madame (great value, stylish and quiet) and the Luxembourg Parc (more expensive but very comfortable and right on Luxembourg Gardens).

The first part of the journey we stayed around the corner in a ridiculously small room. Albeit, the competition is nice and offers an afternoon snack with cocktails, this hotel, cannot be beaten for its value. The common rooms are tiny, so don't expect to come in and put your feet up. The \"exercise\" room is a joke. The location, solitude, chic factor, comfort and willingness of the staff to help with anything you need, however, is a great asset to this establishment. The club room, based on the previous poster's comments, is the room to book. It is spacious, quiet and has a beautiful outlook to the tree lined square. We love the neighborhood and there is a great array of restaurants around beyond earshot. We did not try room service or breakfasts but the bellman was precious in his efforts to help and the concierge sent us to great restaurants where the locals go...would recommend this hotel to anyone without hesitation.", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cCharming Boutique Hotel in Paris\u201d", "Author": "halfrench", "ReviewID": "UR66095213", "Content": "We had a very enjoyable stay at this hotel.

The location is excellent \u2013 just a stone\u2019s throw away from St Germain and St Sulpice. The decor is sleek and subtle in a Wallpaper-ish way. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, and the WIFI worked without fail. There were also some nice touches including tea with some light snacks every afternoon, and newspapers in the lobby. Now, the downside: The rooms are ridiculously small for what you pay (\u00a3210 in our case). I have travelled throughout Europe and stayed in far humbler quarters, but I have to say at these rates I could not help feeling slightly ripped off. I am a vertically-challenged Asian, and even I felt claustrophobic! It was so cramped that to open my suitcase while being to reach for things in the cupboard, I had to open the cupboard door, stick a chair between it and the bed, then place my suitcase on top and open it such that one end is ON THE BED (see photo to believe). Needless to say, opening the other suitcase at the same time was out of the question! Also, despite staying three nights basic amenities were somewhat lacking, e.g. there was only one cup in the bathroom, and no drinking glasses. When we returned to Paris a few days later, these were in our room. Rather inconsistent... I would definitely stay in the area on my next trip, but I am not sure I would return to Recamier at the current rates because of the room size. If the hotel offered more appealing rates, I would definitely be more inclined.", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cThe BEST!!\u201d", "Author": "cecilnyc", "ReviewID": "UR64785169", "Content": "I am a very picky traveler with high standards for accommodations...everything about this hotel - decor, service, attention to detail, location, quality of amenities, facilities, etc. was perfect.
