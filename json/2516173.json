Although it seems fairly newer, just seemed dark and dreary throughout the building. The room was average and nothing spectacular compared to all the others. Breakfast buffet was alright but it is located in such a narrow area and when you have more than 4 people in the area, it is utter chaos. The only GREAT plus to this place was the front desk clerk. He was extremely friendly to us and recommended a great place to eat dinner just up the road with great steaks.

Suite is open layout with no separating doors from living to bedroom area. Kitchenette sits right at entry doorway and has very little working room (between the coffee pot and other stuff sitting on the counter, there's almost no room for your own stuff). Small fridge sufficient for keeping items cold. Microwave on the older side but does its job. HVAC is a spit system set into the windows. Found it best to run them when not in room and turn off once you're back in room - that way the room is cool but there's no loud fan blowing at you. Air coming out of units are a bit musty.

The whole facility was clean and inviting. No evidence of wear and tear anywhere. The standard king bed room was spacious enough, equipped with refrigerator and microwave, and very clean and attractive. We had no problem sleeping -- the firmness of the mattress was just right. I did get annoyed a bit by some constant noise from the refrigerator (during regular operation, not just the cooling cycle) but that kind of thing is easily remedied (so long as one does not need to keep anything cool) by pulling the plug on it. Another option is to run the room fan constantly. For those who don't need a fancy meal, there is a Waffle House just a couple hundred feet away. And, of course, the Hot Start breakfast buffet in the hotel lobby, with a wide variety of offerings. We found scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, Cinnamon Rolls, and cereal, among other choices.

Checked in around 8 p.m. - checkin was quick and my request for a room on the highest floor away from the elevator was met. Room was very clean (including curtains, window, behind doors, etc.), everything was in very good order, didn't use the fridge or microwave but they were available, large flat screen TV, appreciated the toiletries and better than average towels in the room, above average hotel breakfast with a very courteous staff member keeping the area neat/clean/stocked, comfortable bed, and quiet room. Did not use the pool but, upon inspection, saw it was very clean and all seemed to be in good repair. Towels were set out for the guests to use on each chair; found myself wishing I had brought my bathing suit. :-) I had been traveling three weeks at this time, had stayed in seven different hotels (3 being HIE), and had one of the best nights sleep I had in over three weeks. I often post pictures of the rooms I stay in but my room honestly looked like the pictures on the website. I always wipe down any handles, switches, remote, phone, etc.of any hotels I stay in - all were clean. Checked the bed - all the linens/mattress were in good shape and were clean. Took the free shuttle to the airport; very courteous driver and very prompt service. My only *wish* was the opportunity to purchase a secured wifi network (i.e. AirLock, etc.). I would highly recommend this hotel.

The driver came within 5 minutes and took us straight to the hotel. The drive to the hotel was very short.

It was about 80 degrees at 11pm! But our room was very comfortable. It wasn't freezing or too warm. The rooms were beautiful and everything brand new. The bed was amazing! I wish I could have one at home. I had the best sleep of my life! The rooms were large and it had a 32\" LCD TV. The breakfast in the mornings were also great. Lots of items hot and cold items. They also rotate the hot meats daily which was nice. They have a really cool pancake machine. You just enter the number of pancakes you want and they come out in a couple minutes. The breakfast attendant was also very friendly and helpful. One of my family member arrived late for breakfast but the attendant asked what they wanted and she heated up some eggs and sausage for them. They also offer room services and the prices were incredibly reasonable for hotel room service. It was the same as eating out at a restaurant. Which was very surprising.
