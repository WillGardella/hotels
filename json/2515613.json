We were able to meet up with the family (who were staying at the Paris) and come back to a peaceful hotel without the electronic whine of the slot machines or drunken club-goers. The hotel was very nice with island-themed decor that was done in a mostly classy -- not kitschy -- way, and very friendly staff. The room was somewhat small and simple, but clean (other than someone else's dirty sock that we found on the floor on night 2 -- yuck!), and we received a nice handwritten note from Rosa the housekeeper in response to a question we had about the phone (there are 2 lines in the room, FYI). The shuttle service to and from the airport was a great convenience. We only used the service to the Strip once since it only goes to the Tropicana or Mandalay Bay -- both at one end. We wondered why they didn't offer a drop-off/pick-up location at each end of the Strip, but you can't complain about free transportation. It was nice to take the long walk to our destination the *one* time, but we didn't feel comfortable doing that late at night. Luckily, a cab ride to and from the Strip was just $7-9, so we used that for all other times. The pool was absolutely lovely. Very small compared to the big resort pools, but so much more relaxing. There is a waterfall to drown out any background noise (there were often some kids in it having fun), and the chairs and tables are of high quality and very comfortable. Breakfast was decent for being free, but be sure to go prior to 9:30am, or face the rush of people trying to grab their bagel before the service ends.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cHotel cancelled my reservation without my consent\u201d", "Author": "jpcrash", "ReviewID": "UR129127584", "Content": "I booked a room for two night to arrive in Mid May.

I'll go over the few negatives first. The rooms are smaller than most Hampton Inns. I killed a cockroach on the first day, and it wasn't vacuumed up on the 2nd day (I stayed 3 nights), so I know they don't vacuum daily (OK by me as long as they vacuum between guests). The shuttle isn't very frequent (hourly on the hour only), and it's almost 3/4 mile to walk to the strip (1 mile to the MGM Monorail station as the crow flies, according to my i-phone GPS). Also, lots of helicopters fly overhead for reasons I never deduced (one staff member thought it might be people flying to Hoover Dam?). With these caveats in mind, this Hampton is a cut above most others. This place has far more space at breakfast than most others, so finding a place to sit down at breakfast would never be a problem (I'd think). The swimming pool is more attractive than most. It's probably good that it's shaded most of the day in the desert sun. The hot tub was closed while I was there. It did concern me a little that there was no work date set on the sign. I'll give the hotel the benefit of the doubt that this wasn't a weaselly way to make an indefinite closure. Everything else in the hotel was in good working order, including the gym and business center. I also give this place extra points for having a very functional internet connection. It was at least ten times faster than the connection at the Doubletree near the airport, where we spent one night before moving here. The clogged sink in our room was promptly fixed with one call. Even the paneled elevator was more attractive (and faster) than those of most other Hampton Inns. Usually when I go to Las Vegas, I prefer staying at a more upscale facility on the Strip. However, when we must go during a high-occupancy period (we--well, mostly my domestic partnter--were attending the very large National Association of Broadcasters convention), I would not hesitate to stay here again rather than spend over $250/night for similar digs on the strip.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cClean, Family Friendly, Nice Breakfast\u201d", "Author": "SDBeachbum", "ReviewID": "UR128416867", "Content": "Lots of families.

We recently stayed, we're still here as this moment, in LV on Tropicana's, west of I15. On our second night, the hotel was beset by 14-17 year-olds who yelled in the hallways, banged doors against the deadbolts they had set to keep them from closing, and ran up and down the halls. The few adults with the ones on our floor had as much effect on their behavior as swatting at flies. Now and then awe would hear attempts to restrain the kids, but within minutes the behavior would continue as before. When I called the desk on Thursday night, the woman taking my call asked what I suggested she do about the situation. The next day I was told there were similar groups in every part of the hotel, and there was no other room likely to be more quiet.

Our flight was over sold and we took the voluntary bump. The airline provided us with some generous flight vouchers, meals, transportation, and (gasp) a room. We were a little worried since normally the airlines don't spring for a nice hotel. So, before we left, I did a little research on TripAdvisor. The reviews set my mind at ease. We called a number to the hotel and arrange the free shuttle they provided. The driver was there in litterly 10 minutes. Way quicker than I expected. This guy was a riot. He was an ex cop from New York. Very friendly and had some great conversation. Wish I had his name, but I can't recall. The ride to the hotel was quick. I would guess maybe 8 minutes. The hotel is close to the airport. It is located on Tropicana and Dean Martin, appoximately 1/2 mile from the strip. When we arrived, check in was quick and clerk was polite. We requested a non smoking and king bed. We were granted that request. The room was nice, modern, and clean. It was equipped with free wi-fi and a large flat screen tv. Shower was also nice and clean. They also provide a free shuttle to and from the strip. You just let them know and they will take you there. They drop you off at the Tropicana. The shuttle ride is about 2 minutes. You could walk to the strip in about 10 minutes. When you want to be picked up, you just call the hotel and they send the shuttle. They do pickups until 2 am. Service was always quick. We didn't have to wait long at all. Maybe 5-10 minutes. Check out was quick and easy. They had a nice, free, continental breakfast in the moring. We took the shuttle back to the airport. It runs every hour. Our flight left at 8:40 am. We took the 7 am shuttle and arrived with plenty of time. Here is what sets this hotel apart from others. When we arrived at the airport, I noticed my wallet and travel pouch was not in my bag. I started freaking out. There is no way I forgot it or lost it. I called the hotel to see if I dropped it in the morning when I was checking my emails in the lobby. No such luck. My throat was in my stomach. I had lost our newly recieved flight vouchers and wallet were gone. I thought what the heck, it's worth checking the room. They took my number and said they would check and call me back. I am thinking, \"ya, I bet they call me back in an hour and can't find it\". Litterly within five minutes they called and said they found both of them.

There are three large screen TVs that are perfect for Football fanatics like myself.

Pool / Exercise Area - These are the only two things I could review negatively on. The pool deck is being refurbished which is no problem as they let you know on their website and at the front desk. I like the hot tub versus filling the room tub with water. The exercise room needs to be cleaned and the machines tuned.

Free hourly drops and pickup to Tropicana Casino, about 5-10 minutes ,which is at the end of the strip and to Mandalay Bay. Last shuttle pickup from Tropicana is at 12:30am. Generally reliable (out of 7 days, only once did we call and have a long wait), different drivers, some more flexible than others. Walking: 15 minute walk to the Hotel from the Tropicana. We walked it on 2 days, but the sun is quite hot, so take an umbrella / hat. Bus Cross over to the New York New York and goto the bus stop on Tropicana Avenue Stop ID: 2813 Take the 201 Bus towards 201A Tropicana Westbound to the next stop Tropicana @ Dean Martin (W) Stop ID: 2804. Cross the road and then the Hampton inn is just after the gas station. 3) Pool Seemed decent, we did not use. 4) Internet Good connectivity in the rooms, as well as business center on ground floor. 5) Friendly staff 6) Good Laundry facilities for guest ( 2 washers/ dryers on the ground floor) Cons 1) When we got to our room the sink had some black spots, but we thought it was the design of the sink. Next morning the sink was clogged up. Spoke to hotel reception that changed our room and sent some one up to check the clogged sink while we were packing to move. I later went back to the room and checked and the guy had also scrubbed the sink, since most of the black spots were gone.Also the air con in this room was kinda of noisy. 2) We were moved to a second room on the same floor. We also got 1 night stay free. In the shower there are some pinkish lines which are suppose to be design elements (marbling I think), however it doesn\u2019t really do anything for the d\u00e9cor. 3 of us were sharing a room with two double beds, and of 3 hotels we visited on our trip, these double beds seemed the smallest. 3) There was a convention a couple of days we stayed there and the breakfast staff was a bit overwhelmed with the increased numbers.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOUTSTANDING INN!

The BED is probably the most comfortable bed I ever slept on. The rest of our group which had 9 people all agree as well. Continental Breakfast: Great! It's not gourmet but its great to have in the morning with friends. Food includes cereal, coffee, fruit etc. Pool: Nice, can get a little crowded but still really nice. Distance: You will need a car to get to the strip, but it's not far at all. Price: Awesome! We went on a weekend and everyone was happy with the amount we divided among each other. VERY reasonable. In conclusion, if you're looking to have fun in vegas on a budget, this room for the price is really worth it. The lobby downstairs is NICE and my friends and I had memorable moments here!

Overall, we liked the hotel. The lobby was bright and spacious. A free full breakfast was provided, and though the food was not the tastiest, it was, well, free and abundant. We especially enjoyed the pool and hot tub: they were clean, of a good size and the whole pool area was pleasing to the eyes (better than the pool at Paris, frankly). For whatever reason, at about 9 pm we had the pool and hot tub to ourselves. The room was adequate, which is to say, it was a typical hotel/motel room: two queen beds, desk, desk chair and chair, and television. The room was clean, but showing its age. Our view out of the small window was of a parking garage. We did not have to pay for the room (it was paid for by the airline), but we understood that the cost was $69 a night. If so, you can find deals for bigger, better rooms right on the Strip. For me, the walk from the Inn to the Strip (the closest casino/hotels are the Excalibur and New York New York) was less than ten minutes. However, I would not walk to the Strip at night, and the walk along the unshaded highway during the day when temperatures were over 40 degrees celcius was not pleasant. The Inn has no casino, but the Day's Inn a few minutes' walk away does. Like most \"locals' \" casinos, the slots were looser there than on the Strip or Downtown. The Orleans and its huge casino are about a ten minute walk away also, but my comments about the walk to the Strip apply here too (at least two adult superstores along the route, though, for your shopping pleasure). We noticed that most of the other guests seemed to be Europeans, many with teenagers. I can understand why: the Hampton Inn is a clean hotel with a great pool and no casino, perfect for families with kids. Would I stay there again? Yes, but only if I could not find a much better room deal mid- Strip (which these days is hard to imagine).", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ottawa canada", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "canadian-eh777", "ReviewID": "UR78549592", "Content": "Just off the strip but you will need a car or taxi.

If you have an early morning flight (ie: 6am) the hotel has a shady and cheap way of handling guests transportation to the airport. For this reason, I would not recommend this hotel if you are a business or leisure traveler and have an early morning flight out the next day. The bad: Susan. Just Susan. Front desk.

She was called in from the back room by another employee (is this why she was upset?) to help the crowd, and was short, snippy and unprofessional to at least two of us.

Such is the case with Lena. I left my house at 3am to catch an early flight to Las Vegas Nevada, and with plane delays, by the time I got to the hotel, I already had a 14 hour day, and looking forward to several more hours of work on my lap top before I could unwind. I have stayed at this hotel many times over the last year, and every time I walk through the front door of the Hampton Inn Tropicana, there is Lena with a smile on her face, and greets me by name. I know it seems a small thing to be courteous, but with Mondays like mine, it means a great deal. She stands there all day doing her job, being the first impression of this hotel to weary travelers like myself, and she does so without a hint of insincerity.

We were greeted reasonably but with a focus on efficiency rather than warmth, and placed in a third floor room. Renovations were done about a year ago and the rooms have a warm, semi-tropical vibe with yellow walls and bright orange accents in curtains and furniture. New lamp fixtures are kind of retro in appearance - I think my mom had some of these triple-glass-globe lamps in our house in 1977, or maybe I just saw them on a Brady Bunch episode. I don't expect they'll hold up fashionably for very long. Carpets are light and show stains - and there were some in both rooms we stayed in. Possibly in keeping with the retro theme, the TVs were NOT renovated with the other hard goods and remain a 25\" boob tube with perhaps 15 available channels - a definite disappointment. HSIA is free but wired-only in rooms; if you can snag a room overlooking the pool, you might be able to use the wireless signal from there. Beds are Hampton standard and can get warm, especially if you have a balky AC unit as we suffered during our first night. The AC units are old-style through-the-wall PTAC units under the smallish window in the room, and during our first night, the compressor was even noisier than these units are known for - plus, it would not cool the room below about 70. We requested service on the unit the next morning and it was swapped out with another unit with digital controls...which promptly performed a compressor on/off cycle that could only be described as 30 seconds of \"chuffing.\" This supposedly new unit was loud and even more unable to hold temperature - after an hour in the room with the digital thermostat set at 60, the room was about 75 degrees. We requested further service and were told that we had received the one and only replacement AC unit available for a 300-room property. However, they did have another room available so we packed everything up and moved down the hall. Luckily, this PTAC unit operated quietly and efficiently. Beware of the poor maintenance budget, however. The poor maintenance extended to hallways, where the year-old \"new\" carpet looked like it hadn't been cleaned in five. Then there was breakfast - never a Hampton Inn highlight, and in this case particularly downmarket. Each day of our stay a large tray of biscuits was presented - with absolutely nothing to cover them with. Someone needs to inform the staff that biscuits are usually half of \"biscuits and gravy\" at a \"free breakfast\" venue. The egg \"circles\" were watery and flavorless; the sausage patties about 70% fat. It appears the management is providing exactly the bare minimum needed to keep the franchise flag with the breakfast offerings. Overall, I still rated the property average because their rates were excellent over the Labor Day holiday - $58 on AAA rate. At anything approaching \"rack\" rate, I wouldn't recommend the property to anyone.

A couple of main issues bothered us however: First, one morning we found a huge palmetto bug in our washroom. By the looks of it, it must have came in with the morning newspaper (as they place it outside the door). Second, the pool was not warm at all, which is surprising when there are 103 degrees outside.

Third, they forgot to mention that the shuttle will only drop you off on the strip at the New York New York hotel, and not farther, and will also not pick you up, so you either walk back or take a taxi (only reasonable option at 12am). Fourth, the walls are paper thin. On our first night, we dealt with VERY noisy neighbors.

I chose the Hampton Inn because of its reputation and location. I was disappointed and left the second night to stay at another hotel - the Stratosphere. When I made the reservation I called and requested a renovated room with the flat screen tvs and double beds and was told as long as I typed it in the reservation and I called the day before that I would more than likely be accomodated with a room. After calling the dayt before arrival and then arriving I was told they only have 4 renovated rooms and they were King size only not doubles and they were already taken but to try early the following morning at which I did and was told they could not accomodate me as the rooms were already taken...even when someone just checked in and were given the room ahead of me. The bathroom was nice as well as the free breakfast and the pool was beautiful, however the hotel was older than I expected and the room was small. The beds were comfy but small, they said they were doubles but when I looked at the mattress and the frame they looked more like twins and were different sizes as the frame was larger than the mattress. The shuttle service was accomodating but not free as stated as the driver asked for $5.00. Our A/C in our room did not work properly and our room was really hot, when we called the front desk they asked us to wait a few hours for the room to cool down and mentioned that they do not keep the a/c on in the room before a customer arrives....they said they open the windows to let the air in which is really just the heat (which was over 110 that weekend) into the room? Hours later we came back and the room was just as hot but then the front desk mentioned they were sold out and we sweat all night until we were finally able to move to another room the next day. The location is across the freeway from the strip near the MGM, Mandolay Bay, and other attractions but not close enough to walk to. I travel alot for work and am very familiar with all the hotel brands, services, and accomodations each brand provides and I was very disappointed in my stay at this Hampton...overall I would not recommend it.", "Date": "July 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cAmazing service, great hotel\u201d", "Author": "taffy2001", "ReviewID": "UR16024162", "Content": "I stay at Hamptons frequently for business, but this was a vacation trip and this Hampton was the best I have stayed at.

The staff was very polite, friendly and knowledgable about the area and recommendations. They have a two key safe deposit box system, instead of the in room safes or the one large safe in the office. We felt very comfortable leaving valuables in the safe deposit box. The room was clean and comfortable. With the typical Hampton Inn beds and pillows, it was a good night sleep. The bar was nicely stocked and had a larger variety than most hotel bars. And we were allowed to take the drinks out to the pool. The pool was decent sized, with a waterfall and a hot tub. Lots of seating and lounge chairs were available. And the pool towels were not the normal 3 foot long towels, they were the big beach towels. The location is great. About a 5 minute easy walk to the strip. And for the price, you can't beat it. The continental breakfast was also better than normal and had all sorts of variety. Parking was free and there was plenty of spaces available, and they also had a parking garage for the busy times. The only downfall was the business center.

This is a plus and saves about $16. Our shuttle drivers were fabulous! They will shuttle you TO but not from several casinos on the strip for free (we always tipped however). We were told we could walk to the strip, which is true. However, the walk will take you under the interstate overpass right off the Excaliber parking lot. There were numerous homeless folks there and we were not comfortable carrying large amounts of cash while strolling thru there. We were advised not to walk it at night. We ended up taking the shuttle to the strip and bringing a cab back, which averages about $10 before tip. Breakfasts were typical Hampton Inn style. Good selection of fruit, muffins, bagels, cereals, etc. Eggs were pre-cooked or one morning they had breakfast pizza's. The shuttle driver had told us about the place across the street for breakfast and said it was good. So we took our lives in our hands one morning and took a hair-raising walk across the street to the Wild West Gambling Hall and Hotel for their $2.99 breakfast.

Although we did not have a choice of hotels, we do happen to like this chain. BUT...this wasn't like other Hampton Inns.

The staff was great--pleasant, trying to accomodate everyone, and very honest when asked which nearby restaurants were good. (Wild-Wild-West restaurant had good recommendation from the hotel staff as well as other guests who had been on our flight.) In fact, the hotel staff was probably the best thing about this hotel. There were no non-smoking rooms available, so our room was most definitely a \"smoking room.\" The carpet was damp for some reason, and I don't think it was from carpet shampoo. There was food on the floor on the far wall where a table and two chairs sat. Housekeeping probably forgot to vacuum there. And also forgot to bend down and manually pick up the food. But the bedding was clean, and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was fairly clean, hot water, plenty of towels, and a coffee pot. And the hotel was very quiet. There was also a roach in the room, on the wall. One of the other reviewers said he/she was told roaches are normal for Las Vegas. Maybe so, but I've never noticed a roach in any of the 4* and 5* hotels on the strip. Although we didn't use the pool, our room did have a pool view. The pool looked clean from what I could see, and it seemed like an adequate pool area, and was being enjoyed by several kids and teens. If you want something that is not on the Strip, but within walking distance, this is probably adequate, although I would not recommend walking or jogging in this area at night. At 5am, waiting to take the shuttle back to the airport, there was quite a bit of foot-traffic from the Golden Palms Hotel across the street to Tropicana Avenue, all wearing very short skirts, skimpy tops, and very high heels. I'm pretty certain they weren't registered guests of the Golden Palm, either. They appeared to be women who worked at the Golden Palm, but were not employed there. But they only crossed through the Hampton parking lot without approaching the door. Perhaps because there was a security person at the Hampton lobby door. The hotel provides a complimentary shuttle to NYNY, MGM, and TI (to return to the hotel, you'll need to get a cab or walk back.)
