She's worked there for years and gave our family great advice on the essentials of the city. She explained the Metro to us, knew store hours, and recommended nice places to eat.

The complimentary wi-fi from our floor worked well as well. The only issue was this \"beeping noise\" that would go off every now and then, in our rooms and apparently in the hallway.

Hotel was clean and room was a good size with a fridge, tea making facilities and an electronic safe. We also had a bath. The continental breakfast was simple but plentiful and the breads and pastries superb. Staff were fantastic, particularly Anna and Daisy at reception who also speak pretty good English. If you're used to walking then this hotel is within reach of most of the major attractions however the Latin Quarter on the south bank and the Eiffel Tower take a bit of reaching by foot and so maybe a bit onerous for some. The hop-on-hop-off bus could be an alternative. We also booked a tour package through City Discovery Tours encompassing dinner at the Eiffel Tower followed by a Seine River cruise then onto the Moulin Rouge show and it was sensational, all for a fraction of the cost had we booked each one individually.

It was unfortunate that they are having renovations which meant lots of noise first thing in the morning, no aircon and breakfast only in the room. We arrived on a Sunday and after booking a delux room got into room 306 which would be no more than 3.5m x 3.5m and by the time you have a king size bed, desk and wardrobe, not much room for anything else. I don't care what others say, you can spend a bit of time in your room and its nice to have space not eating breakfast while sitting on your bed. The bathroom ceiling was so low, I am 6'5\" or 196cm and couldn't stand up in the bath while having a shower and of course the shower rose is lower again, this is not on so we thought a delux room is like this!!! Imagine what a standard room would be like. We complained and was told to wait till the manager got in the next day. After being awoke by hammering caused from the reno's at 7:30am, we had our breakfast on our bed and proceeded to the reception area to talk to the manager. She was polite and stated the room we were put in was not a delux room and go and check out a room on the 4th floor or room 504. Other alternatives was there is another best western hotel around the corner which seemed nicer but the rooms weren't much better so we opted for room 504 which was bigger and I could fit in the bath for a shower. Only trouble being, the smallest lift I have ever seen (4 people max and that would be a squeeze) only goes to the 4th floor then you have to climb the stairs to the 5th floor. We stayed 7 nights there and all the time I was cursing my wifes friend. Look we were warned on the size of rooms in europe so we were expecting a small room but for goodness sake, be warned. If you do intend to stay here, ask when the renovations will be finished and when is the aircon going to be working for I suspect with Summer coming along, it will get hot. If you open the window, then you here all the building works. The bed was comfy enough but we had no tea and coffee making facilities but one phone call fixed that. They have such small kettles that only boil enough for 2 cups of tea and take fore-ever to boil. The power point in the bathroom is goverend by the light switch. There is no free bottles of water but the tap water seemed ok to drink. The safe is not a keypad type but rather a unique key that you pay 50euro deposite for. Rm 504 has two seperate rooms with 2 TV's but if one wants to watch another channel, then there is no door to seperate the noise so it sort of defeats the purpose a little bit. While we were in the room one day around 4pm, had someone knock then open the door. When my wife said yes to them, we couldn't see them, they quickly shut the door. Made us a bit suspicious so don't leave any valuables lying around in the room. Breakfast is 13 euro which you fill out a form the night before. We saw people having breakfast in the reception area and the staff didn't seem to mind. We ate out for breakfast. There are plenty of places around and even a maccas about 10min walk away. Taxis are fairly cheap. 13 euro to the Eifel tower. The Hotel will book taxis for you and they were helful enough to confirm bookings we had made prior through viator. There is free internet but the PC blew up on the ast day we were there which was a pain for we wanted to checkin our flights. We did book through the hotel a dinner cruise on the seine. Take the 9pm one. It cost us 178 euro per couple. It was great. They ask for 30 euro deposite and you can request a table by the window. The food was devine and of course the scenery was electric especially when they take you past the tower. We ate at a Italian restaurant called Pompai which is turn left then take the first right. You will see the restaraunt up on the left. If you also turn left at the restaurant and walk about 50m, there is a small shop that sells fruit and softdrink , bickies and water etc. I think by memeory there is another shop further up that sells the same. Things to do. Make sure you book the fat bike paris tours. a 3 hour pushbike tour which was fantastic. Get Sadie as your guide she is fantastic and the tour is for all ages and very leisurely. If you do the night one aswell, you get it half price. We tried to go but was too stuffed to do it. If you want to get the hop on hop off bus, make sure you get the green one not the red one. I think Viator only do the red one. The reason being is that te green bus does the red buses route but stops 16 times against the red ones only 8 times which is a pain for some of the sights you wish to see, takes ages to walk to once you get off the red bus. Also the green bus does 3 other different routes here the red one only does the one route. The cost is the same. SCAM SCAM SCAM. I got caught at the eifel tower. A so called bosnian girl comes up to you and first asked if you speak English which I said I did then she shows me a card which said along the lines, my brother has leukemia and needs urgent medical treatment blah blah blah please give money so I gave her 1 euro in which she persisted for more so I took it back and got up and walked away. She pestered me and followed me saying she was sorry so I gave her the euro and off she went. Then another came up 5 mins later and another and another. Boy this brother has a lot of sisters!! Then I realised it is a scam for there were 10's of these girls working the tourist scene. Not only there but at the Arch de Truimphe (how ever you spell it) they were there too. In the end we told them to get a real job and stop scamming poeple. We even got approached while eating Maccas in the store. If you don't want to donate, just say no. They do walk off. Another con is a guy bends down in front to you and claims to have found a gold ring on the ground. If you take the ring, then they ask for a finders reward. I just said in my smart a--- voice, good luck to you mate and looked away. They soon walk off. There are the usual beggers begging for money while they wear their gap hats and smoke. Plenty of vendors selling miniture eifel towers.My wife bought one for 10euro but the starting price was 25 and in the shop it was 40 so we got a bargin but it probably cost 2 to make from chine!!!. Make sure if you buy one that it comes apart for easy storage. Make sure you buy your tickets to the eifel tower prior for the queues get really long unless you want to climb the stairs. If you get a ticket to the summit, you still have to queue on the 2nd floor to get up to te summit but it is well worth it. I loved the tower and could stare at it for ages. We booked a dinner at the tower and river cruise through Viator which was fantastic. The food was great on the 1st floor. You have the choice of what time to catch the boat so we waited till the 10pm cruise to catch all the building lights at night. Yes it is still light there after 10pm. There is also a cafe on the 1st floor so when we got kicked out of te restaurant, we went there. Louvre was ok.All we wanted to see was the mona lisa. Buy your ticket prior or in our case, we got the 2 day museum pass but don't queue at the pyrimid like everyone else, there are two other entrances that no-one queues in so if you look at the Louvre and have the pyramid in from of you, to your right hand side wing there is an entrance in which we walked straight in and within 10mins, was taking photos of the mona lisa. How simple was that. That info was thanks to Sadie doing the bike tour. If you go to Notre Damm, that is free enrty but the queue is long so we sneaked in through the exit door. We did two tours outside of Paris. One was to the Loiure valley and went to three Chalets which was great and the other was to the champagne region to visit G.H.MUMM and Moet & Chandon. Two great champagnes and lovey was in here element. We had 7 nights in Paris and loved it. Would I come back, you bet. Would I stay in the Hotel Sydney Opera, no I don't think so.

I know what to expect, small rooms and bathrooms. The location of the hotel is great, one reason I chose it, I even got upgraded arrival without request to a larger room. The problems with this particular one :- 1) dirty dust covered hangers on arrival. I just wanted to finish my unpacking and get some rest after a 22 hour trip. Not a problem and I just thought the hangers hadn't been used in a while. Nothing to complain about. 2) Breakfast room was being renovated and so all orders were room service. This equals luke warm coffee and only cold foods. 3)I only realized after day 3 that the that they were NOt vacuuming the rooms. You see some crumbs on the floor and think they must have missed a spot but after the 2nd day you realize that they are just not cleaning. If you serve food in the rooms I would assume you would need to vacuum very carefully. 4) the vacuum or cleaning bags were in the hallway the entire time. lack of tidiness for a hotel 5) general lack of cleanliness everywhere. They were renovation the ground floor and I am sure that dust and dirt may have contributed. In their defense, I did not bring these issues up when I was staying there.

Had a complimentary upgrade to a Superior Room on the fifth floor and internal corridor which was large (for a traditional 3* property in central Paris). The room itself was very clean, tastefully decorated with a beamed ceiling and oh so peaceful! The air con was a bonus as were the windows which looked down onto the grass roofed breakfast room on the ground floor. Breakfast was included in our rate and the breakfast room was small and immaculate. It was self-service but had an impressive choice of items and perfectly adequate to begin the day. It isn't the Four Seasons and doesn't pretend it is. I'd be very happy happy to return and recommend this hotel to others who are looking for something other than a grand Paris hotel or a bland chain!", "Date": "August 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cComes as advertised!\u201d", "Author": "Barratt", "ReviewID": "UR8030179", "Content": "This small 3 star hotel in the heart of Paris is well located for the visitor.

Its location was excellent, (near Metro, Printemps, Galleries Lafayette, railway station, sightseeing bus etc) and the hotel was exceptionally clean. Daisy, the receptionist on arrival, was very friendly and welcoming and happy to assist in organising day trips etc. Some other reception staff were not so cheerful!! Now for the downside - air-conditioning. It was unusually hot in Paris during our stay in April 2007 and the hotel policy was \"..we do not provide cooling at this time of year\". Cooling could have been provided at the flick of a switch by the receptionist!. We requested this several times to no avail. So there were sleepless nights due to a hot room and not being able to leave the window open because of street noise from traffic and the pub opposite. The Best Western management obviously need to use common sense and review this policy!! Breakfast was always under the watchful and annoying eye of sour-faced staff, enough to turn you off your cereal and room temperature milk (yuk!!). Breakfast at a cafe nearby could have been a better solution but it came in our travel package.

The area is lovely with nice restaurants and within walking distance of the Louvre. The hotel is small, but charming and of a good standard. Staff were very friendly and the service in general was excellent. The room was small but perfectly formed. Vey clean and modern with flat screen TV and extremely goood water pressure in the bathroom. The only negative was that we were on the ground floor quite close to reception and breakfast room and could here noise. Also, the metro is running right underneath the hotel, which could disturb you on the ground floor, but train stop running around midnight.
