We never used the kitchen, but loved the fancy chairs and the ambiance. We later found out an infamous robbery happened in the very same room some 35 years ago and made it into Time Magazine.

It's also very fairly priced, compared to most NYC hotels. You also can't beat the many surrounding Comedy Clubs, Bars, Restaurants and shopping attractions.

Because of the prices that we were asked to pay ($199 and $279 a night), we thought we would be renting one of those beautiful rooms and were really looking forward to a terrific value. When we get to the hotel the service was horrible. The people behind the counter obviously didn't care about our experience, considering we got there at noon and our rooms weren't ready until 5:30. Due to \"cleaning\". Either whoever had that room before us had torn it apart, or the people that work at that hotel are lazy. We FINALLY get to our rooms, open the door, and literally stood in silence. The room on the website that was supposed to be the one we rented, was nothing compared to what we were expecting. The room was tiny, nails were sticking out of the wall, a huge amount of mold on the bathroom ceiling, and beat up furniture. The carpets were stained, and the worst part about the entire room was the fact that the smoke detector didn't have batteries. The curtains were torn so you couldn't cover the window completely at night. Just hope that someone in the apartments across from our window wasn't watching. Their internet connection is on average, two bars. Then about every half hour it disconnects and you have to log back on. In our other room, the story is pretty much the same. EXCEPT, the view is of a space about 8' by 8' full of trash. You can get a really good view of it when the sun is directly above it. The fire escapes can only go up, and it is actually and aluminum ladder. And for some reason the air conditioner, that looks out onto the trash pile, doesn't fit in the window. To compensate for the gaping hole in the window, they duct taped a piece of plexiglass to the open window. Unfortunately, only the top. Leaving rats and other critters to feel free to join us at night. Don't worry if you notice that important things, such as fans, air conditioners, and bedroom locks are taped down. Also, just ignore the hanging exposed wires that you find painted over to blend with the wall color. And don't be alarmed when you notice that over the bed frame there are numerous hand prints, and I'm pretty sure I saw a dog paw print too. And for the people who like to unpack their belongings in a dresser, I would advise against it. One: because when I opened the dresser someone had left a note saying how disgusting it was and number Two: they are moldy and the wood is rotting. If you keep your fingers crossed, maybe you will be lucky enough to have a legitimate room number plaque. Otherwise your room number will be stenciled on there for you.

We were told to return 2 days later if we wanted to speak to Arnold. Two days later we revisit the hotel and Arnold is there but won't meet with us, or take a call on his phone.

There are reports that the historic landmark has been sold, so not knowing what the future holds for the hotel, I wanted to get in before it changes. My stay began on a very positive note with a very friendly desk attendant who invited me to call if I needed anything. In the background I heard another employee on the phone complaining, \"Someone's bought the hotel, but we don't know who it is. So we don't know what's going on.\" I was given a key to suite 1018 on the top floor. I had heard that the hotel was a bit of a dump... not borne out by the somewhat elegant lobby, but the hallways are a bit dingy, and the ceiling is a morass of makeshift wiring and plumbing. My suite was huge, larger than most New York City apartments I've experienced. The walls and ceiling were all covered in odd linen-covered panels that had seen better days. The windows were open when I entered, and the woodwork around them was badly weathered and decayed from exposure. The emerald-green carpet was wrinkled and lumpy, and the big pink lounge/sofa looked right out of the 80s. There was a strange mix of victorian and mid-century modern antiques. The separate kitchen had a gas Jenn-Air stove, but one that was designed to be built-in... this one wasn't. A small refrigerator was placed in a deep pantry, and there was a large piece of specialized wooden furniture, the purpose of which I never discovered. The bathroom appeared to have been tiled in the 70s and featured a built-in harvest-gold tub... with no hot water when I needed it. The linen-paneled walls were badly water-stained in places, and although in a state of disrepair, everything was actually quite clean. The bed itself was amazingly comfortable, and I had an extremely restful sleep... until I heard a pounding noise that sounded like the roof was caving in. It was then that I noticed that a large closet just inside the door had a slanted roof that indicated the bottom of a staircase. So the suite next door must have been some sort of duplex, and every time the residents clomped down the stairs it reverberated through my suite. A large fireplace adorned the main room, containing a few scorched logs. I couldn't tell if the fireplace actually functioned, but there was no warning not to try. It's amazing the place hasn't burned down. I know NYC hotels are expensive, and a place this large is likely a bargain at $325/night, including taxes. I don't regret staying there, but I wouldn't do it again. I know some of my friends would have refused to stay the night because of the state of things. And while the staff were surprisingly friendly to me, there are a number of permanent residents who live at the Chelsea who seem to resent the \"tourists\" and show open disdain when sharing the elevators and such.

Once a lavish hotel, then a seedy flophouse, and now somewhere gloriously in between: The place is located in the heart of Chelsea. Within 15 minutes on foot, you can get to some great places to eat, and some fun clubs. The subway stop is right there for the E line, but unless it's pouring rain or freezing cold, you would rather walk, because there is always something to look at. The hotel rooms are sparingly adorned: White walls, with a cool painting on one of them. a Circulating fan was a nice touch. The floors were wooden and painted black, which was a nice contrast. I chose the cheapest rate available for a Double ($139 w/shared bath) and that is easily half what most other hotels charge in the city. The bathroom was right on the other side of my room, and other than one guy who showed up in the middle of the night to use it... I never had to wait. Bathroom was clean and the shower was hot with good force. Half the hotels I stay in have a trickle of luke-warm water, and that is what I expected here. Not so! Staying in my room, It was easy to imagine what it was like to be Bob Dylan, strumming a guitar in the '60s, and thinking of his next brilliant song. One room down the hall had an out of tune electric guitar and amplifier in it. They must have imagined what it was like to be Sid Vicious. The sound of the old steam radiator, and the wind rushing through the window I had left open a bit (to cool off the room and keep the air circulating) made for an interesting sound, it lulled me to sleep, actually, and made for some interesting dreams. Everything was very clean, but the walk in closet was hilarious... a primer spattered dresser and old picture hooks, that made me wonder if someone didn't sleep here back in the day... My window had a view of... a brick wall. What do you want for $139? Don't expect to find breakfast in the lobby. There is a donut shop next door for coffee and any kind of food in the world can be found in an instant. CAUTION: There is a thumpy, noisy club underneath the lobby that is open late, so if you want a sounder night's sleep, you might not want to request a room on the first floor.

It was so, so lovely. And so, so not. I didn't deal with any of the horror stories described by some other users, but I don't need to stay there again. First, the good: the neighborhood is AWESOME. Chelsea is my preferred neighborhood when I stay in New York, because it's very convenient and central in terms of commuting anywhere in Manhattan, but you could frankly have an awesome vacation without leaving the neighborhood. It's not overly touristy, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and any hotel in walking distance of the Chelsea Market is worth considering, IMHO. If location and vibe are your primary motivators, this hotel might be a contender. That said, here's the review: The good: -room was HUGE -view was interesting -location was amazing. -art was fun -totally eccentric, mentally stimulating, and giggle-inducing -full kitchen would have been great if I'd used it The comical: -smelled like pot resin -Some kind of chant circle/massive incense burning went on for hours on our first evening there. It was fun to wonder what it was all about, but then, I'm a generally good sport. -REALLY smelled like pot resin. The bad: -Drippy stains on mantle of fireplace from god-knows-what -World's loudest radiators -Flamingoes on the clear plastic shower curtain -When they repaint, they don't bother scraping off the old, peeling paint/wallpaper/dried god-knows-what. Nope. They just paint right over it, creating an interesting...texture... All in all, I am glad I stayed there, because I've wondered for years what all the chatter was about. I never felt grossed out, encountered any roaches or bedbugs, or had bad service. But then, I have a strong stomach, a sense of humor, and I went in with an understanding that the Chelsea is all about the kitsch.

I happen to love it. It is so much more than just a place to sleep, it is an experience in and of itself. I have stayed at the Chelsea twice (so far...). The first time was with my sister in law. We had a room on the back side of the hotel. At one time Leonard Cohen had also stayed in our room which if you know any of the history of the hotel is kind of a cool little trivia fact. We got a double room with kitchenette. The room was huge! We had two double beds, a dresser, a table with chairs, a vanity table, a kitchenette with stove, sink, mini fridge, cabinets. The room was so large in fact that there was a hallway with a closet leading to the bathroom. All of this for $149 a night (note - the prices of the rooms seem to flucuate with the seasons, we were there in March). Being on the backside of the hotel the room was very quiet. The only sounds we heard were an occasional piano tune making it's way from somewhere else in the hotel and the sounds of the pipes gurgling through the radiators at night. The hotel is actually more of an apartment building rather than a hotel with most of it's rooms having permanent residents. As a result there are sounds of life throughout the building (such as the piano that we heard) and the occasional conversation in the hallway. For me and for my sister in law that is part of the charm. On my second stay at the Chelsea I was again with my sister in law and for one night my niece and her boyfriend stayed with us. We got another double with a kitchenette, this time on the front of the hotel. The room that we stayed in on this visit had once belonged to Edie Sedgewick, one of Andy Warhols factory girls. This room was slightly smaller but still a very good size. And being at the front of the hotel we had access to the iron balcony outside of our window. There were more traffic noises and alot of street noise especially since auditions for Last Comic Standing were taking place and there were folks lined up and camping out outside on the sidewalk for days (the Gotham Comedy Club is right next door). But hey, this is New York City and if a little noise is going to bother you it may not be the right city for you to visit. We loved climbing out on the balcony in the morning and at the end of the night and watching the crowds and the people walking by. Another plus of this hotel to me is the amazing artwork. The lobby is filled with it as is almost every hallway of every floor. If you take the elevator to the top and then walk down you will feel like you're in a secret art gallery. You also never know just what might be going on at any given time. Our room on our second visit was still in the process of having furniture returned to it as we were walking in because it had just been used the day before for filming a scene for Law & Order with Jeff Goldblum. It was alot of fun when the episode aired to see \"our\" room on tv. I can't wait to visit New York again this fall and to stay at the Hotel Chelsea for a third time. If you like history, rock n roll, eccentric characters, and out of the ordinary experiences then this may be the place for you. Keep in mind though that they do not offer breakfast (but there are plenty of places to get a bagel nearby), there are no vending machines or room service or fitness equipment or a pool and your key to your room is still an actual key, not a key card, that is kept behind the desk when you leave for the day. But if you're like me and have always wanted to live like a resident of the places that you visit and not just stay at another cookie cutter hotel than I think you will enjoy the Chelsea.", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cWouldn't stay here again for free\u201d", "Author": "nycdiva2010", "ReviewID": "UR96644685", "Content": "Two of my friends and a parent came to New York for NYU open house.

Thank God. The hotel is grubby, uninviting and DISAPPOINTING! We had previously spent 6 nights at the Hilton Garden Inn on Eighth Avenue which was fantastic, and had booked the Chelsea as a special treat when passing through NY again a week later. The lobby is a bit dull but I remained stubbornly optimistic. The guy who checked us in might have walked in off the street just ahead of us. Far from a uniform, these hip, trendy and rude receptionists wear what they like. Our guy had seriously ripped jeans and a seriously bad attitude. He reluctantly began to deal with us then welcomed an opportunity to disappear to deal with another customer, perhaps a regular or long-term resident who definitely merited an improvement in attitude! On his return we were begrudgingly handed a key for Room 112. When we enquired about a left-luggage facility for the following day we were told \"Yes, that's possible, two dollars per bag\". With the rates they charge, they still find it necessary to charge two dollars per bag! We trundled up to Room 112 and I could not believe the sight that greeted my eyes. The carpet is ancient and looks filthy. There is one bedside locker, nothing on the other side of the bed. A flat-screen TV is available all right, but sits on top of an ancient tallboy in a room that makes you want to spend as little time in it as possible. The bathroom was tired-looking, not officially dirty but not appealing either. The shelves in the bathroom and the bedroom have peeling paint and believe me, you don't want to unpack your suitcase in this room. We were left with an ear-bud belonging to a previous (the previous?) guest in the bathroom and an oddment of plastic packaging sitting in front of the TV. I guess this place was once glamorous but the management evidently want us to see it EXACTLY how it used to be \u2013 no modernisation or modern standards of cleaning to bring you to the present day. The curtains don't fully close either, and the view is of a slightly grim back yard. The one thing I have to acknowledge is an enormous bed - we both got a good night's sleep, once we got over wondering how long the bed had been there and if the covers were hygienic... Final insult is that you have to check out by 11am - isn't there a universal hotel standard of midday? I didn't even want to hang around to put on my face - we showered gingerly and got out of there as soon as we could. We certainly weren't looking for any breakfast thank you. On checking out I was very tempted to ask if our room was typical of Chelsea Hotel standard and tell them it was appalling, but I didn't. Why not? I guess it's because there were other people checking out and the staff were so disinterested that I felt I would only be laughed at anyway \u2013 we decided we had better chalk it down to experience and try to forget it as soon as possible. Location of this hotel is \"good\" in that it's near the subway, but Chelsea itself is rather dingy and down at heel. I kept looking for the hidden charm but if it was there at all it was well and truly hidden! And to put this in context - we paid almost 300 dollars for this dingy room, by the time you take the room rate plus tax plus city charges etc etc etc the final rate is a lot more than it seems! And the REAL sting in the tail was that despite paying in full in advance through hotels.com, we discovered on our return home that we had been charged the full rate AGAIN by the Chelsea! Seeing as they never actually had a conversation with us when we checked out but merely relieved us of our room key, we had no idea they were going to apply the charge to our card. After a few phonecalls (\"Accounts isn't open, I don't have the authority to deal with this\" was the first response) we were assured the amount would be refunded and it was within the week. However I've seen enough comments in other Chelsea Hotel reviews to make me think this is their standard practice - a lot of posts advise to \"double check\" your bill, we certainly would have had we been presented with one!\" All in all it was certainly \"the hotel stay that stays with you, for the wrong reasons\".", "Date": "May 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cHistoric Hotel you just have to\u201d", "Author": "Lyntin", "ReviewID": "UR64864003", "Content": "Ok not the greatest hotel in the world but charming all the same.

It is an iconic, grand old boehmian building dripping in art, history and mysterious alure. It's also a dump with plaster/paint falling off the walls, wood trim rotted around the windows and clean only by the standards of a well dosed junkie. It also seems a bit unsafe. Though there is a dramatic stair well for easy egress in the event of an emergency, the place seems like a tinder box that could go up at any time. I can overlook the cleanliness, I can dismiss the indifferent front desk clerks and I can overlook the fact that I am pretty sure the guy in the room next to me was a drug dealer.

No problem, everything cool, I left the keys went to my room relaxed a bit, changed and left for a little imbibement. My car was gone.

The brooding men (one would be hard pressed to call them \"staff,\") cowering around the front desk look like they have gone or could go a couple of rounds with Stanley Kowalski. They are more like bouncers than staff. And, while they may know the history of the place (a few may have lived it) their attitude is confrontational rather than welcoming and terse rather than congenial. Every time I approached them I felt that I was bothering them. I suppose this attitude derives from the somewhat constant flow of guests who voice complaints (for example, as I waited to check in one bouncer was belittling a guest who was checking out with language that guaranteed he would not consider returning while another clerk tried to explained to a young lady why her room phone didn't work). Our family stay in Hotel Hell started as soon as we walked into our room; dirty, dirty, dirty! I felt as though I was at a CSI crime scene \u2014 everywhere I looked I wanted to spray a white circle around the smudges, thick layers of dust and grime, unidentified toilet stuff, and especially the broken, filthy, blinds. One can only imagine what was hidden unseen on the bedspread. Yuck! We should have left but we had booked two rooms for a family of six and we weren't about to go hotel looking again. We would put up with this but were really tested. Here is a brief list of what we encountered; - The old TV worked but we didn't get very many channels (we could see the channels but the screen was \"blocked out.\" didn't someone pay the bill? -the bathroom faucet ran constantly throughout our stay. - Sunday morning at 8am I asked for extra towels three times by going down to the front desk. After waiting a half hour more I found that the housekeeping staff (which consisted of one elderly woman) didn't show up until 9am. The desk clerk brought the tows up and at 9:15 housekeeping brought up another set. - We went sightseeing for the rest of the day and returned to the room around 6pm to rest before going out to dinner. Bam! A live rock band began playing directly below our room at such a level the floor was shaking (across the hall, another guest said \"everything in her room was shaking.\") It would not have been so bad if they knew what they were doing but, not only were they very loud, they only knew three chords (I though Punk went out in the late 70s!). I went to the front desk to ask one of the bouncers to ask the group to stop but was told there was nothing that could be done, even if they called the police (evidentially, they had tried this on other Sundays). The bouncer told be they would stop after 30 minutes. An hour later they were still playing. - I said I would not pay the bill and the \"manager\" said he was sorry and that he would change our room and reduce the cost by $50. We denied the room change since we were ready to go out but we would accept the $50 deduction. When we checked out no one behind the desk had any knowledge of this. I finally convinced them and they deducted $50 from my bill. -When we arrived, we had to tote all of our luggage to our room so I wasn't surprised when we had to lug it to the lobby ourselves before we checked out. Getting our car was also interesting; I called the number on our car claim check and when I asked if they would bring the car to the front of the hotel, they told me that I would have to pick up the car myself at a location four blocks away. I then called the front desk and was told that my car would be delivered to the hotel. It was.

Clark wrote 2001: A Space Odyssey, there sealed the deal for me. The lobby is in and of itself an experience, with it's famous art and exquisite architecture, and usually filled with both residents and sightseers alike. The staff truly do go \"above and beyond\" in every way to be helpful and accommodating in every instance. As a first-time visitor from Alaska, who also has Aspergers Syndrome, I felt a little overwhelmed at first by New York, but the kindness of everyone I came into contact there with eased any apprehensions I had. I was also fortunate enough to be there on the day of the once a month tour of the hotel given by Jerry Weinstein, it is not to be missed. I'd schedule my trip around it if I were you. The group is kept below 25 people so book early. It was a fantastic, informative tour where you not only went into Sid and Nancy's room/bathroom (I washed my hands \"where Sid did !\") your also given the opportunity to meet some of the artists in residence, and talk with them about there work. I was ecstatic when we were taken into Arther C. Clarks old suite on the 10th floor to meet Ms Rita Barros, a charming, beautiful, talented photo journalist who opened her home to us. For me, the highlight of the tour (the whole trip even) turned out to be my few moments with Ms Bettina Grossman, the reclusive artist. Something about her drew us together and I spent the time holding her hand while her assistant read her words to us. When I leaned down and whispered to her about the strength of her grip, she replied with a smile \"I'm a sculptor\" The few moments I spent with her were like a transcendental experience, and the most cherished memory of the trip. Because I was still on Alaskan time I stayed up late and wandered the halls admiring the artwork and touching EVERYTHING! I'm a very tactile person and made it a point to put my hands on every doorknob on every floor, thinking all the while of all the great cultural icons and not-so-notable people who had touched them before me. The staircase alone is a work of art and the 10th floor had a certain indescribable energy that I won't even attempt to explain or understand. If you ever get the opportunity to stay there DO IT. You'll never regret it! My next trip to NYC will be built around the availability of a room at the Chelsea.", "Date": "March 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "glasgow", "Title": "\u201cA bohemian pleasure.\u201d", "Author": "vitoaGlasgow", "ReviewID": "UR59682429", "Content": "Everything I expected the Chelsea to be , I had wanted to stay here since the days of Blondie & Sid Vicious.

Having previously stayed in budget accommodation way uptown, the Hotel Chelsea was a far superior experience. For $105/night inc.tax (I found it cheapest to book via the hotel's own website), I got my own room with a shared bathroom. My room was relatively spacious, immaculately clean, with a tv, chest of drawers, two bookshelves, fridge, sink and desk. The bathroom was just down the marble-floored hall, was spotless and was never occupied when I wanted to use it. I was on the 9th floor and had a view across the rooftops of chelsea and further downtown, it was really nice. The bed was super comfortable, slept better here than I have anywhere in a while. In addition to all this, the staff are extremely courteous and friendly, there is free wifi throughout the building, and of course as you'll see from other review, the place is the stuff of pop culture legend and there's lots of cool artwork and a nice atmosphere overall. Honestly, I don't know if my parents (in their 50s) would be happy staying here but for a young person or someone happy to not be staying at the Ritz, it's beyond perfect. The location is fantastic, West Village is a leisurely 15min stroll away, there are loads of places to eat nearby and 2 subway lines are 0.5block away and another line is 1.5blocks away. I was going to the airport at 11pm on the day I checked out, so for $2 was able to leave my bag behind the desk and then could wait with it in the lobby while I waited for the SuperShuttle to take me to Newark.

The other disconcerting thing about waiting to see if we did have a suite there, whilst the manager rooted about in a huge ledger, was the pool of blood on the floor right in front of the desk. I never did find out how it got there. Eventually the man on the desk said, \"Oh, you're the guy who sent the fax, right?\" We were in. The lobby of the Chelsea is littered with sculptures given by famous artists who have stayed there at one point or another, but I noticed that one of them - a man sprawled out on a Chesterfield armchair, dressed in Bermuda shorts and sleeping soundly - looked particularly life-like. Closer inspection revealed that he was a real, sleeping, middle-aged man, and not a sculpture at all. He was in that chair, asleep, when we arrived on the first day, still there when we came back from a restaurant at midnight, and in the same position the next morning, when we went down for breakfast. In fact, he was in that chair for the entire five days and nights that we stayed, and I never saw anyone check to see if he was still alive. Since he never lost his choleric, ruddy complexion, I guess that he was a permanent resident. A very tired resident. I say that we 'went down for breakfast', but - despite a couple of lengthy searches, we never found the breakfast room, and ate at a diner across the road. When we asked where the restaurant was on the first morning, we were told it was on the ground floor in the basement, so we pressed the appropriate button in the lift. When the doors opened, we found ourselves in a cramped laundry room, so we got back into the lift and pressed the button just above the lowest one. When the doors opened again, we were back in the lobby, so we made this short trip a few more times until I decided to forget the lift and search for breakfast using the staircase. As I descended the stairs, I could hear the chinking of crockery, and a babble of muted conversation. I could even - tantalisingly - smell coffee. When I reached the end of the stairs, I found myself in the same laundry room, so I gave up after a few more attempts at finding secret doorways on the stairwell, and we found the cheap diner over the road, not being able to cope with the situation first thing in the morning. The Chelsea is (or was) part permanent residential, and part guest, so the gloomy corridors were always full of the smell of steaming cabbage, etc. as the residents cooked their meals at all times of the day and night. They also play music and watch TV at all times too, so I guess we were not on the same floor that Bob Dylan stays on, when in Town. Our room looked out onto the street, and we could lie in bed, watching the top of the Empire State building gently changing colour at night, and listening to the sirens of police cars and fire engines down below. The rest of the time, we just wandered around Manhattan, soaking up the vibes which I am sure you are familiar with, and which don't need description. We saw a dust cart over-turn on a busy intersection. Since N.Y. dustcarts are about twice the size of London ones, this was quite a sight. The Trump Tower - solid gold and as crass as the owner. Egrets in Central Park. A little piece of Egypt, rebuilt in the museum. A tiny wooden shack uprooted from Sicily, plonked onto the street and surrounded by towering sky-scrapers - home to a quaint Italian restaurant. Vast department stores, packed with Clinique cosmetics at about half the UK prices. I heard last year that the Chelsea was going to have a make-over. Although it probably desperately needed one, I hope they didn't sanitise the life out of it. Did you know that the Chelsea was the first place that the survivors of the Titanic were taken, once they were fished out of the freezing water?

Our room came equipped with a sink and cabinet and the bathroom was outside our door down the hall a bit. They also have larger rooms with kitchenettes for families or extended stays and private bathrooms as well. We didn't find there to be an issue with sharing a bathroom as it was only with one other room, and we never ran into any problems with seeing anyone in the halls or having to wait for the room. Our room was right under the famous Chelsea sign as seen in the movie for SId and Nancy, overlooking the street. The room was very clean and the bed was comfy. The hotel itself is a tad run down but more for the option of posterity rather then sluminess. The walls in the hallways are dedicated to portraits of the celebrites that have stayed there and other artists giving it a very funky feel. The larger rooms are each painted up with funky themes as well. There is a big debate right now on renevating the entire hotel and people feel that this would be a great loss to the history of an era and New York itself. I agree. When I think of New York I immediately think of the Chelsea hotel. If your going to the hotel with the intent of anything to do with Sid and Nancy - don't bother. The rooms they used no longer exist ( we asked). But for ghost hunters this hotel definitly has the feel of some presence. The elevator doors opened at random with no one on them or in the hallways, we saw weird shadows on the balcony and there were weird wind rattlings on the upper floors. Spooky but fun. The location is very central to lots of goings on in the city. When we first arrived in the city we spent the first night we stayed up near the museum of modern history and discovered that everything we wanted to see neighbouhood wise was in the lower end of the city. From the Chelsea we walked the neighbouhoods of: Soho, Noho, Greenwich village and the east village. The higher the street number the farther away everything is from Times Square which is 42nd street. The chelsea is at 23rd street and we walked to Time's Square. If I go back to NYC I am definitly staying here again. The staff we pleasant and the hotel was a good story to tell.", "Date": "October 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "virginia", "Title": "\u201cPubic hair was free!!!\u201d", "Author": "camclarissa", "ReviewID": "UR46710248", "Content": "OMG, what a surprise we had.

Finally the occasion came up, a 4 night weekend in New York. I wasn't sure what to expect, as I'm rather picky when it comes to hotels (I need a good bed and a clean bathroom), and the official website doesn't show much. So I went on tripadvisor and checked the review and pictures, and the bad reviews scared me a little. What a mistake. Instead of trusting my guts and booking 4 nights, I only booked one night and the rest at the Grand Hyatt through Priceline (price for a night there was the same as one at the Chelsea). I arrived early (around noon), it was too early to check in but they took care of my luggages so I could be free to walk around for a couple of hours. Then was time to check in. I was anxious about the room, expecting a really small room (I booked a double bed with kitchen, the second cheapest, still, $160), but it turned out the room was amazing. Very large, beautiful, lots of light. Exactly like I imagined, only better. It had a gorgeous fireplace, two windows, high ceillings, a huge bed, a closet. Old furnitures that were exactly what to expect in this hotel (they fit perfectly), I also loved the bathroom. I just wanted to move there! I will for sure always come back, and not just for one night... I was really sad to leave, and even sadder when I saw the room at the Hyatt (supposedly 4 stars, I expected something great), tiny, dark, with unfriendly staff. Terrible stay there. It was also a pleasure to walk around and look at the art on every floor. The lobby was very lively, great people, great staff (except I wish they'd have answered my question! I asked how many rooms exactly were in the hotel, an information I can't imagine secret, and he was very vague, he wouldn't tell me the exact number nor how many residents they have, and that upset me a bit because it mattered to me to know :P).

The Chelsea is historical; it's a cultural landmark. Everyone from Mark Twain to Sid Vicious has stayed here, and its gained a reputation with the underground crowd as a sort of cultural Mecca. The problem with this, of course, is that its gained mainstream popularity through word of mouth, which causes many people to presume it to be some sort of luxurious, gentrified resort. Don't get me wrong; I found this place to be very relaxing and comfortable. But luxurious, it ain't. I stayed in a single shared bathroom on the third floor with a balcony right next to the Chelsea Hotel sign--room 319. It was enormous, had a queen bed and decent TV, two nightstands and lamps, a worktable, and a closet. By Manhattan standards, the room was enormous. It was also very quiet. There was also the scummy element. The headboard had water stains on it and mirror large rust-marks. The turnover service took my sheets and placed them in a way that didn't really replicate the way they were when I came in, but did good enough. The shared bathroom was not a problem--it was shared amongst three rooms, but I never found myself without a pot at an inconvenient moment. I came here from The Big Apple Hostel in Times Square, which I found to be inhospitable. I've been a hostel traveler for the last several years of my life; I'm not sure if I'm simply outgrowing the ability to cope with hostel standards or if the Big Apple was simply too awful, but I had to switch to a hotel. I figured while I was here, I might as well make it a memorable switch. Originally I was going to book the Waldorf-Astoria--the other NYC hotel I fantasize about--but found it overbooked. The Chelsea it was. Do I regret the decision? Not one bit! Two nights of fabulous sleep, great staff, and an unbelievable artistic, bohemian air about the place. It's not for everyone. Don't expect grandiose amenities and pristine, newly remodeled furniture; that's not what the Chelsea's about. If you want someplace nice, check the Waldorf. If you want culture, artistic individuals, and a place to sleep, this is the place for you. Also, take the ride to the top of the building and sneak out on the roof for some awesome photos.

Along with those issues, here are the other issues I didn't expect from the hotel: Door would not lock or shut Noticed crumpled cookies from the previous dwellers The fireplace had a cup filled with used cigarettes No towels when I initially walked into the wash closet A beer was left in my fridge (Even though my friend thought it was sent from God LOL this was still really disturbing) The pink comforter was seriously worn I noticed some random blonde hairs as well (I'm a red head and my friend has pink hair - no way that came from us) The sofa that was in the room also had holes in its material No internet I knew that the room was \"made up\" since the bed was done and everything else looked in place.... but this is neglect. Cleanliness is important to me and this really bugged me. We called the front desk and addressed my issues, they said someone would come up. Me and my friend walked out for a bit, when we came back we saw that the bed was redone and we had one extra towel. Trash was not picked up and we still had an issue with the door. I called back and 20mis later we hear someone shutting our door. I was pretty upset, this was supposed to be my escape with her and I ended up wanting to escape. Even though the room was extremely worn, it was seriously the most beautifully designed I have ever seen (note, this is kinda biased since I am crazy about the color pink lol) it was such a pity to see that a few things destroyed it.", "Date": "April 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cDon't let the haters scare you...\u201d", "Author": "SherpaDan", "ReviewID": "UR25896762", "Content": "I arrived Friday, March 6th at the front door of the Chelsea, with a bit of weary optimism. I had peeked inside the lobby and snuck up the stairs to gawk at the art before but had never actually spent the night. Some of the drastic comments I have seen posted here almost got the best of me, but I put my curiosity in control and drove down from Boston for the weekend of play. I had priced the local garages online for what a weekend stay would cost me, $150.00 for three days (no in and out privileges) seemed about the norm. I was very pleased to find out the Chelsea has some deal with a local garage, where a valet will pick your car up when you check in and drop it back off when you check out\u2026.. for 25.00 a day. That\u2019s pretty cheap. The front desk staff was both helpful and inattentive, a combo that worked just fine. This is not a five star Hotel, don\u2019t come here expecting to be pampered, but don\u2019t thinking the staff are villains either. If the guy was busy, I waited, and waited, but when he did help me he was very helpful giving me ideas of what to do in the area, stories about the hotel \u2026 and residents. I booked a one bedroom for 209.00 a night. I was terrified of trying the shared bath for 89.00. I booked room 502 a room that had been rented to a resident until about 6 months ago. IT WAS HUGE. The room had been recently painted (white) and had the wood floors just refinished, but other than that, it was the bare bone of what I had expected. The bed itself was really hard to sleep on but surprisingly clean. The bathroom was spotless. For the most part, everything is old with 100 years plus of character.

It took two very poor receptionists about 30 minute to straighten out the mix up - though most of that time was spent with them ignoring us, talking amongst themselves or serving other people who had arrived after we had. Eventually we were shown up to our room, which was very, very basic. It had a view of a run down apartment block next door, and a bathroom that was so small only a yoga instructor could make their way around it.

The porter was a guy called Angel - softly spoken and aptly named. The room was stunning - totally at odds with the descriptions I'd read.

We had to listen for noise, it most defintely did not keep us awake. You will encounter the locals, ranging from people looking like bag ladies, to another couple who could have been Ramones - he answered to Joey, and I think she was called Sheena.....they just add to the character of the place.

Unbelievely, this hotel was recommended by the conference we were attending (what were they thinking??). We paid $269 plus tax for one night. Our experience started when we arrived in the lobby to find what looked like homeless people milling around. Funky it is, with a cool exterior and artwork on every possible interior wall space, but we did not give up immediately. We were booked for 5 nights, and when we checked in, they ran our credit card for the full amount and put the slip in front of us to sign. We asked to see the room first. What kind of hotel bills you the full amount up front? We were given a key and optimistically took our bags to a room on the first floor. It was extremely small, had dirty old carpet on the floor and bare lightbulbs in the entranceway.. There was more but I think you get the idea. We went back down to the reception area and told that the room was unacceptable to us and that we would only be staying one night. They offered to upgrade us to an \"apartment\" on the 4th floor. It was midnight so we had no choice. The room was bigger with two queen beds, but sill two bare light bulbs in the hallway, cracked paster everywhere and a thousand layers of paint that would not allow the doors to close properly. No tv, not a single glass and no internet access. The smoke detector was beeping because the battery was low and we waited 20 mintues for the staff to come and tell us that they did not have another battery. There were decent towels in the bathroom and lots of hot water. Our room (425) was next door to someone who seemed to be running a psychic reading business--it smelled like dope and when the occupant opened the door to let.someone it, the room was filled with red light and what looked like crushed velet and beads. We asked for a couple of glasses so that I could take an asprin for a growing headache, and were given two wine glasses that the guy at the front desk washed out for us. The \"hotel\" is also run as apartments (perhaps for unemployed people on income assistance?). We asked someone in the elevator what they were paying a night, and was told $109 but the room had no bathroom and was very small. We left the next morning.The only thing decent about this place was the front desk staff--they were very nice and quite professional, particularly given that we made it clear that the accommodation was unacceptable to us. They refunded the credit card amount for the other nights, but we are expecting to have to pay for the exchange from US to CDN. I would never recommend this \"hotel\" to anyone, not even my worst enemy. I am not someone who needs to stay in 5 star accommodation (usually choose 3 stars), but this place was barely a one star (is there such a thing as a half star?). They are charging exhorbitant prices based on their status as a heritage site that famous artists onced lived in. I'd recommend you walk in (and then quickly out) of the lobby if you truly want to experience the history of the place. Oddly, there were some tourists in the lobby taking about how \"cool\" the building was. I guess that accounts for the higher ratings on this place, and everyone is entitled to their opinion. There were several events on in NY so we had a very hard time finding another place to stay. I stumbled across another hotel just down the block, called the Chelsea Savoy Hotel. For $200 per night, we got a nice king bed room with very nice bathroom and coffee and pastries each morning (which we did not sample as we slept in to catch up on missed sleep from our previous night's experience).

Here's the review of the room: Positives--Large by NYC standards, 7th floor facing 23rd St., huge balcony, although no doors to get to it, had to climb through the 19th century windows. That's it for the good........ Negatives--Ridiculously flimsy double French doors to get into the room, so don't leave anything valuable when not there. I had crumbs on my bed, a light filmy substance on most furniture, and a bed comforter that I wouldn't dare run a black light over. I only had one thick black hair to take off my bedsheets fortunately, but I did awake in the morning to a strong smell of urine. I only noticed it when the A/C was off. The TV itself and reception were horrible, and the remote was caked in grime/dirt/god-knows-what. Bottom line, for this location you will find bargain prices at this hotel. Do your homework beforehand though, some rooms apparently share bathrooms/showers, and I had no idea of this.

The location is great - close to subways, shops, restaurants. The building is great - an old institution loaded with character and great artwork in the stairwell (you must climb or descend it at least once). It's definitely not a \"posh\" place, but so richly haunted with all the legends that have stayed there. And the hotel continues to house a colorful cast of characters, which adds to the fun. No doubt, there are more legends in the making.. and their loitering in the stairwell this very minute! The rooms are ok... beds were surprisingly comfortable. Seemed clean enough.
