We could also order eggs cooked in a variety of ways. Service was impeccable but not at all stuffy. We did not eat dinner or drink in the hotel as the prices were very high, even for Paris. On the first night we had booked a restaurant nearby using Kirker`s concierge service, and were given a lift there in the hotel`s car at no extra charge.

Due to previous comments on Tripadvisor I had requested a room overlooking the rear courtyard which was beautiful.The hotel is just finishing off a complete renovation and everything looks very french and lovely. We stayed in the basic room category and initially I was worried about the size/bed etc. However, the rooms are about 25 sqm which although not huge is a very decent size for Paris especially if you only stay 2 nights. The bed was only queen size and could have been more comfortable but with only 2 nights it's not a bid deal.The bathroom was lovely with separate WC. We had breakfast included and I have to agree with previous comments that this is probably the closest one can get to a Michelin star breakfast. Although not a huge choice everything is so beautifully presented and of course delicious. The only down side of the hotel are its extra ordinary prices with food and drinks (mini bar and lobby lounge). 10 euros for a fairly small bottle of Evian, and I think the minimum prices for simple dishes such as Onion Soup or a Club Sandwich were between 20 and 25 euros. This is probably in line with other 5 star hotels in Paris but it does feel beyond reasonable. So if you are planning to eat and drink in the hotel ensure you have a large wallet.

Since we booked this through our Virtuoso travel agent we obtained an upgrade from our deluxe room to a premier room on the 1st floor, facing the street. The Lancaster is perfectly located, a matter of steps from the Champs Elysees on Rue Di Beri; also a few blocks away from the prime designer shopping on Rue Faubourg St Honore. As some other reviewers have mentioned the concern about the noise, let me give you my perspective; yes its steps away from the major artery of the city, yes there is a bar across the street, yes it has 18th century sound proofing ... but is it really \"noisy\", in our case the answer was acceptably no. We were disturbed one morning by the recycling (bottle) garbage collection and an early morning delivery truck, and the occasional early morning riser in an adjacent room ... however overall I would say that we slept well and were not frustrated by any extraneous noise. The room (premier) was large by european standards, and very comfortable, including a flat screen tv, minibar, a writing desk and a couple of easy chairs. Again as some other reviewers pointed out there was some wear, however honestly we did not notice any of any significance, and my paranoia as created by reading such reviews was unfounded. We had a package with full breakfast included, which was enormous and delightful ... room service included. We never got a chance to try the restaurant but we did avail ourselves of the lounge and found the staff to be very friendly and attentive, Coffee, tea, wine, food and Wifi were all available. Overall the staff were SUPERB! ... very friendly, helpful and attentive, even when we had to change our travel plans to adjust for French ATC striking and our flights to London were cancelled the conceirge was there to arrange a car to take us to Gard Du Nord for the Eurostar. Also the same conceirge nailed a restaurant recommendation to Le Stella a quintessential Parisian Bisto which we would totally recommend! (We also dinied at the Buddha Bar and La Coupole in Montparnasse) Another very nice service is the complimentary limo which you may use in the evening to take you out to dinner etc. All in all, despite reading some of the negative reviews prior to staying here, all our worst fears were not realized, quite the opposite, the Lanc is a very small, sophisticated, comfortable and welcoming hotel smack in the center of Paris ... you would do well to stay here", "Date": "October 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Staff / Great Location\u201d", "Author": "tryapepsi", "ReviewID": "UR78129536", "Content": "The Lancaster is a boutique hotel.

However, if you get one of their rooms that face the street, be prepared for hearing a great deal of noise all night long. Unfortunately, there are few rooms which do not face the street. I am not sure why a hotel this luxurious, that is trying to cater to an upscale clientel, would not invest in better sound proofing. I had read many of the previous reviews that stated this was a problem but was not concerned because we are heavy sleepers. We were constantly awoken each night to loud sounds from the street, or one night we could hear the people upstairs arguing at 3 in the morning. Lancaster, listen to what the reviewrs are saying!! I would not return here for fear of being placed in a street room again. This is a shame because it is a 5 star hotel in every other way.

Five minutes after that the waiter asked for our room number and indicated that we could have a table. Eventually a very arrogant woman, who I assumed was the Maitre'D, emerged to tell us they were full and that we could not dine at the hotel. I have no idea why they started this process other than to indulge in some pathetic display of arrogance and predjudice. I can only assume that when they checked our reservation, they determined that we were staying on a heavily discounted promotional rate and were not worthy of their temple of gastronomy!

When I arrived in Europe, I checked my email and found that I had mistyped a digit in my credit card number and that my card was invalid, and my reservation unconfirmed. My partner called the hotel directly and spoke to a gentleman at the front desk. My partner provided the correct credit card number and asked for a confirmation, but this gentleman indicated he was not in reservations and could not confirm. As the Hotel Lancaster is part of the Leading Hotels of the World, and I am a President's Club member, I contacted LHW in the US. They could not pull, through any of their systems, our reservations and said that the hotel was full. Three times I emailed the hotel to secure a confirmation, but I never received a response. My partner tried calling again, but he was unsuccessful in securing any word of \"confirmation\". We, therefore, scrambled to secure a last minute reservation in Paris. Imagine my surprise to receive a $941 charge to my Visa upon my return for a reservation no-show. The hotel firmly implores that we had a confirmed reservation, yet we had no confirmation number and our last written email from the hotel said our reservation was now unconfirmed. Three full months of wrangling with the hotel and with Visa proved fruitless. The $941 charge stuck. I travel domestically and internationally on a weekly basis. This is the first time, in over 16 years, that I have ever been charged a no-show, because I completely understand how reservations, confirmations, and cancellations work. Despite having everything in writing and a cell phone log, I still got stuck with the charge.
