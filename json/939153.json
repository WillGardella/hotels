{"Reviews": [{"Content": "What a rip off - avoid like the plague We stayed in Chifley Potts Point for 2 nights over new years. One would expect to pay a premium for new years, but $270 per night for this dump was a bit much.We arrived at the hotel a bit early, to find out that we could not check in until 3pm - international check in is 2pm...The staff on check in were OK, it was the room that REALLY let the place down.For a start, the pictures that they use for advertising are not from the hotel. The rooms are only just above a hostel level. Plain white walls  plain white bed sheets (just sheets, no other covering).The bathroom has to be the piece de resistance though. First the smell - a constant vile smell of urine. Then the shower - a plastic hose connected to the taps that jumped out of its holder when ever you turned on the water.This would all have been bearable, except for the fact the air conditioning did not work for more that 10 minutes at a time. After that the Air Con control would display FAULT and refuse to work. The air con was reset, it broke again. A service man came up and dismantled the air con, it broke again. It was reset again, it broke again. The staff made no attempt to offer an alternative room, offer a fan or anything else to help deal with the 30+ degree Celsius heat.Overall, a very disappointing experience.

The reality is it's in the middle of KingsCross, overlooking (and hearing) strip clubs and street partying and misery. Our standard room had a good bed but was no more stylish than a hospital room.

My wife and I stayed at the Chifley for three nights early in September 2008. On check in we were impressed with the look of the place and the room we were given - pretty new, well appointed and roomy enough. Unfortunately the first night was Saturday night and even ten storeys up the noise from Kings Cross was pretty disturbing. We booked because the hotel is called Chifley Potts Point - if we had known it was actually smack in the middle of Kings Cross we might not have bothered.However for the next couple of nights the noise wasn't really a problem - except early on Monday morning when the people in the next room started talking.My big gripe is that, as we were going on the road, I was accumulating one and two dollar coins for laundry, and I left about $15 - $20 in change on the desk. Sadly when we came back from a day out, the room had been cleaned and the clean-out included all but $2 of my change. When I complained, the desk staff were a bit non-committal but shortly after that a chap came and checked who had entered our room during the day, and I thought we might get a result. Several weeks later I have received absolutely no communication from the hotel as to where my money went or even to apologise for this gross breach of trust.To add insult to injury I have now discovered two charges on my credit card, attributed to 'Crest Management' for $12.95 each, even though we didn't watch any movies, use the minibar, make any calls or incur any other charges. It wasn't till I read another review and discovered that the hotel was formerly called the Crest that I realised this crowd had charged me for absolutely nothing.

This is not necessarily a bad thing, as the white noise helps cover the noises from the street (esp. on a Saturday night :)- The bathrooms are not really anything special, but generally fine.- You can certainly hear the neighbouring room guests if they are chatty.I essentially enjoyed our stay in Kings Cross (3 nights) and the room was superficially very nice (including widescreen LCD TV, albeit the picture was stretched as it didn't have a digital box), however I can state that around $10 in small change went missing from the room, and despite reporting this to reception and having them promptly check the electronic door lock to see whom had been there last, we had no resolution, and not even a follow up call.Granted there is a safe in the room, and you can be sure we kept all our valuables in in after that, however you would think some small change scattered across the desktop would still be safe in a hotel such as this.

This was more than we were planning to spend, but it was our first holiday together, and thought it might be nice, especially since there was so much talk of the refurbishments.The location was absolutely excellent. Right in Kings Cross, amidst all the action. The room was supposed to be 10th floor and above, but somehow we ended up on the 6th. Maybe a minor detail, but we were excited about the sky-high views, and it didn't entirely deliver.When we arrived we were checked in and went up to our room with no mention of wine, so we assumed it would be in our room. It wasn't, and we had to go back down to ask about it. I guess make sure you remind the staff at reception what is meant to be included?The room was rather bare, so I suppose if you're a true minimalist it will work for you, but I'm more about the little extras, and there were definitely none. The bathroom was pretty unexciting, even though it had a bath. Water flowed readily all over the bench-tops, which got a bit annoying.THE AIR CON IS THE NOISIEST I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. Made it a little hard to relax and get to sleep. Honestly, it sounded worse than an old washing machine.The bed was nice, and we were able to wheel it around the room easily, which was fun. The tv seemed small-ish at first, but the clear, bright picture meant that we ended up having to sit further away anyway, so can't complain there!Breakfast was okay- not the warmest, but a decent selection. The staff at breakfast were very friendly and accommodating. All in all, it was okay. Next time I'd pay much less for a simpler room, minus the package, which doesn't really deliver.

It was actually quite funny to find that the hotel we had been told over the phone was brand new was as dirty as its car park. The floors were filthy the entire time we were there, the cupboards in our room were old and suffering water damage. The bar fridge was dirty, disgustingly dirty. Some thing had obviously dripped down and died in all its brown glory some time ago into the fridge door and all over the wine that we decided against getting. The bed was simply white sheets over an uncovered doona, NOTHING like the pictures on the web. The bathroom had mould inground. The shower was only big enough for one of us to get under the head at a time, and it faced up. So we had to take turns in holding it for each other to avoid drenching the ceiling and so we could get reasonable wet without becoming very cold - lucky we like each other. Bemusingly for us, the 'marble' like sink was crooked and obviously unfinished (you could see the inside of the wall behind it, the mirror was delaminating and the sink tap flooded the floor everytime we turned it on. The airconditioning was too loud to sleep with on - luckily we were having a big night out. But it wasnt all bad, breakfast was ok, even if they did take a few attempts to get the food we requested.

Saying that, the decor in the entrance was fresh and funky and very up to date.At check in the staff were friendly, and again, the decor was impressive. We were shown to one of the newly refurbished rooms, but not with the 2 single beds as requested. (I had called the hotel a few days before to confirm our reservation and was assured that everything would be as requested).After advising one of the staff that the room was not what we had requested, we were offered a standard room (we had asked for a deluxe room) with the 2 single beds as the other deluxe rooms were booked out.Just to verify that I had made the booking correctly, I tried to check the booking on my lap top. - NO WIRELESS INTERNET as advertised. Reception later advised that I would only be able to get internet access if I went to the lobby area.The standard room was not completely refurbished, old bath taps, old bar fridge old sink etc. We were unable to sleep for most of the night as we had a very amorous couple next door to us moaning and groaning all night (the soundproofing was that bad it did sound as though they were in the same room as us).When we complained to the staff at reception, they just had a quick giggle to themselves and didn\u9225\u6a9b even suggest talking to the couple to try and get them to be a bit quieter.The free breakfast we were given to compensate for the mix up with the rooms wasn\u9225\u6a9b up to scratch either. Lukewarm cooked breakfast, room temperature juice and brick hard mini croissants.It also seemed like the place was still being refurbished because of the constant drilling in the lobby.When we were eventually allocated the room we had originally asked for, we were pleasantly surprised. It was stunning. Fantastic modern brand new d\u8305cor, great quality fittings and a lovely plush carpet.Then we got a phone call advising that the pipes were frozenand there was not hot water. We found that absolutely hilarious (considering we are from Scotland originally). So I went to brush my teeth (that wouldn't have needed any hot water). Strangely enough, it was hot water coming out of the taps and not cold.We had some travellers cheques to change and after consulting the booklet which listed the hotel facilities provided in our room, we were pleasantly surprised to see that the brochure said up to $200 in travellers cheques could be changed. -NOT SO. Also advertised was the fact that all fridges in the rooms would have jugs of iced water - NOT SO IN EITHER ROOM. We went to reception (which was flooded - maybe from the frozen pipes?) and were advised that they did not yet have the facilities to change the travellers cheques, and were not aware of anything stating otherwise.So, we proceeded to the bank located close by. When leaving through the main entrance, we were greeted by the most awful smell of excrement, this terrible smell lasted about 2 days (I still have no idea what it actually was).It's a great shame that what you pay for is not what you get (in more ways than one) when you go to the Chifley, and that you are downgraded instead of being upgraded for something that's not your fault.

We were seriously disappointed.-Trash sat in the hallway for 8+ hours on our first day-The hotel spa is under renovation and not available for services, nor is the conceirge able to recommend an alternate spa or even a simple place to grab lunch.-The elavators broke downNeedless to say, all those renovations aren't worth much when the service and function of the hotel is terrible, I hope they improve, because I've stayed at better 3 stars and they are supposed to be 4.5.", "Date": "Feb 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR236260909", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "pippigirl"}, {"Content": "Very disappointing I stayed at the new Chifley for a week in February.The reception, bar  restaraunt looked very impressive, new  modern however, the service isn't great and alot of confused people are working on the desk being it's first month open. When entering the elevator though to get to my floor, the elevator smelt a little like alcohol so I'm not sure what this building previously was?!The hallway to my room was dirty and looked like it had never been vaccuumed! There was also a cleaning cart in the hallway for my entire stay!The room itself had two beds, a king and single that were jammed together to make one enormous bed?! A Bit confusing as to why they did this but the sheets and beds seemed brand new. Thankfully!The carpet, TV and curtains are also new however, that's about it! I would not in any way say this hotel is new, it's been renovated and that's it!The bathroom is old and for my first shower the showerhead fell off the wall and I've had to hold it each time I shower to clean myself.The bedside tables and TV benches are all old and the bottoms have lots of cracks and marks on them.I also did not have a phone in my room for my entire stay even though they informed me I should have one and they would bring one up three times that I asked however, that was obviously too difficult.I had a few drinks in the bar and also a meal. The alcohol is very overpriced and I had a seafood basket for $18 - I got two pieces of calamari, three prawns and fish that tasted like it was the cheapest fish possible! Couldn't eat it and ended up only eating the chips! Very disappointing and would never return to the bar for food or drink!Overall, I was severely disappointed with this hotel and would definitely not recommend it to anyone for atleast 2 years when they'd hopefully have sorted out all their MANY teething problems.", "Date": "Feb 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR994900709", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "TraceyT5445"}, {"Content": "\u95c8\u70b2\u7236\u9287\ue0a1\u7a76\u9352\u253f\u4efe\u6fc2\u754c\u73db\u9366\u822c\u5127\u9289\u55d0\u5137\u9287\u0441\u4eda\u9286?#x201d;
