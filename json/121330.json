Breakfast was Embassy Suite standard, good selection of made to order and buffet items. Happy hour was popular, and good to grab a drink. Business center has 2 computers for use with a printer. Nice to have. Wifi worked well in my room, never a problem. Only item that would make me think twice before booking again was location. A mile from the strip, the property feels distant at times. there are some places to eat about half a mile away and took advantage of that. The hotel does have transportation to the Strip, but be warned. It is once an hour. That is it. And not exactly to the Strip. They let you off at the Fashion Show Mall ONLY. And in the oddest place at the mall. on the farthest reaches of the mall next to the barbage and loading docks. You then have a 10 minute walk around the mall to get to the strip and begin to walk where you need to go.

The manager's reception included free well drinks, beer, and wine with tortilla chips/salsa one night and potato chips/dip the other night we went. The monorail station at the convention center is within walking distance. The issues we had were as follows: 1. With the concern of water such an issue in Las Vegas, it was disturbing to have to run the water for over 10 minutes just to get a lukewarm temperature. Management indicated they were waiting for a slow period to repair the heater, but I wonder if that's not just a fact of life since the heater is in the back of the hotel. 2. The fire alarm went off at 4 am one morning and 7 am the next morning. False alarm, but we were told that it's a recurring problem and really needs to be fixed. 3. We were able to bring our pet which was nice; however, the cost seems pretty prohibitive in my opinion. The advertised charge is $50/night + tax. We ended up paying $100 + tax for four nights.

The rooms with two queen beds have a 20 square foot balconies at best that you can stand on and watch the traffic from the side of the building. For this pleasure you pay extra. I really suggest that Hilton makes this clearer on their website, for those of us who use the internet to make reservations.

I will say that it seemed to be a \"all hands on deck\" type of situation, where all staff was assisting in any way that they could, but it didn't seem to be enough. By the time we got there (around 930), it was complete chaos (running out of supplies, long lines, mass confusion). But, I will give them the benefit out of the doubt because Sunday morning was a completely different scenario and seemed to be much less crowded and more organized. We did go down earlier, so this could have been the reason. Regardless, we all enjoyed the rooms and the hotel itself and would stay there again. but would get there early for breakfast!", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fountain Valley, California", "Title": "\u201cSecond Stay\u201d", "Author": "beetrvln", "ReviewID": "UR119648532", "Content": "Once again we found ourselves at the Embassy Suites near the Convention Center in Las Vegas and were not disappointed.

Nothing else, a half hour into the \"reception.\" A weird thing is that my friends had bottled water in their refrigerator, which the front desk told them was free.

Hello. My name is Brian, Hilton Honors Member XXXXXXXX. I am writing this letter to withdraw my membership in Hilton Honors. I no longer wish to be a member of Hilton Honors, and will not spend another dollar with your hotels. Not that it will matter to you, but I am going to explain why that after 96 nights in less than 1 year I am doing this. My last four or five stays with you were miserable by anyone\u2019s interpretation of the word. Since it was my most recent trip that forced my hand, I will describe it to you. Checked in on 09/8/2011 at the Embassy Suites on Paradise Rd in Las Vegas. I\u2019d checked in for four nights, yet had to obtain new keys daily because they\u2019d kept checking us out. (Room 920) Found major rust stains in the bathtub, where my daughter, age 9 would have bathed. Disgusting. Morning of 09/09/2011\u2026breakfast. Discovered mold on bread that my daughter had eaten. Mine and that had by my wife had mold on it as well. Staff joked that there was no extra charge for the mold, but we didn\u2019t find that funny. They\u2019d cleared the bread from the table. Morning of 09/10/2011\u2026evidentially the joke was on us, because we were fortunate to have received more moldy bread. We\u2019d stopped eating in your hotel after that. Afternoon of 9/10/2011\u2026returned to the room at 3:00 p.m. The room had yet to made up, no towels\u2026nothing. We were told by the front desk that not having the room cleaned by 5:00 p.m. was normal!!! Really?!?! Because if that\u2019s true, I\u2019ve been pretty fortunate over the years. Afternoon of 9/11/2011\u2026retuned to the room at 2:30 p.m\u2026.guess what? No towels, no clean. Evening of 9/11/2011\u2026remarked that lowering the flag to half-staff on the anniversary of 911 was something the hotel should consider\u2026especially with military personnel staying at the hotel. Evening of 9/11/2011\u2026toilet breaks. Go downstairs to report it. The woman behind the desk asks me to stick my hand inside the toilet to \u201cfix the rubber thing\u201d inside. Needless to say, I\u2019d declined. We used the lobby restrooms that evening. The major problem I have is that I\u2019d spent a lot points for this trip for my family. If I\u2019d paid, I\u2019d be seeking a refund! Just one bit of advise and then I promise you will never hear from me again\u2026If your staff treats Diamond members this way, how do normal everyday folks get treated?

After spending four nights here, we were so bored we switched to over to the Paris casino (which ended up being cheaper than the Embassy and under government per-diem) and just put up with the ringing slot machines and smokey lobby. This hotel sucked the life out of the first half of our stay. The Embassy Suites was exactly what an Embassy Suites should be and I after staying in them for nearly 30 nights last year, I would know. Same amenities, same bed, same alarm clock, same breakfast options, everything you expect, minus two big things. This hotel is not quiet. The atrium acts as an echo chamber and even though I was on the top floor towards the back, I could hear kids at the pool every morning. This hotel is not in the flight path for McCarran Airport, but it is in the flight path for Nellis AFB and those long range transports make a heck of a lot more noise than a 747. The other big thing, and this was the primary driver for our move, the internet connection was unusable. The hotel is completely wireless and the network quickly gets saturated. There are Ethernet ports on the wall by the phone, but the staff informed me that they are decorative, not functional. DSLreports had my connection speed at 30kbps the Tuesday night I was there. That's below 1994 AOL speeds. At that speed my VPN connection couldn't stay up and I ended doing work on my phone. Ever tried to work on presentations on an iphone? Also, be prepared to wait for machines at the gym each morning. There are three treadmills and two ellipticals and many of our servicemen stay here, so those guys are up and rolling at 5am to work out each day. There are other drawbacks as well, such as the surrounding neighborhood. Mostly low rent apartments and no-tell motels. The only food within walking distance in the Envy Steakhouse in the Marriott and a McDonald's. Who goes to Vegas and eats at McDonald's? If you look at the map, it appears there are a great deal of restaurants with half mile, but with Paradise Road being torn up to replace water mains, and the shady neighborhood, it's not a trek I was willing to take. On the plus side, I did have a decent view of the strip from my balcony. I would call it more of a tease than a view. If you are reading this, you were probably looking for a hotel with the attributes I was. Hilton brand, away from the strip, quick commute, quiet, easy to get some work done.

The sofa bed was not comfortable at all but I suppose they are not made for comfort. The hotel is non-smoking. They have an indoor swimming pool that we didn't use - I would have preferred an outdoor one but I would think the indoor version is welcome in winter. We had the free wi-fi which was a nice touch and came in handy. There are not many places to eat within walking distance - a McDonalds nearby but not much else. The hotel is a short drive from the strip - we enjoyed the proximity without the noise and traffic of the Strip. The best part of this hotel is the free cooked to order hot breakfast. It was awesome!!! It really makes this hotel a great value. Cold Selections: fresh fruit, assorted cereals, bagels, breads, muffins, danishes, Hot Selections: Bacon, Sausage, French Toast, Eggs, Potatoes, Oatmeal, and the BEST omelet bar that also makes fresh cooked eggs. Omelet choices were; bacon, sausage, ham, onion, bell pepper, jalepeno, mushrooms, tomato, and spinach. They had juice dispensers, coffee and tea. They also had a soda dispenser that had Coke products. We didn't participate in the manager's reception but they had nachos and popcorn the one night that we walked by.

We upgraded to one of the \u201cLarge Balcony Rooms\u201d, and I\u2019m glad we did. They all face the strip, and the view at night is spectacular. I am convinced the view is better than anywhere we have stayed on the strip because you can see it all. The balconies are about 12 feet by 30 feet with several chairs and lounges. (See Picture) We only made the managers reception one night. About the same as any other Embassy Suites. This one how ever does not give you a limited number of tickets for drinks like I have run into at other Embassy\u2019s, so it is all you can drink. The free breakfast is very good and the quality at this one was above normal. The room is typical Embassy, but I think they had just been re-done. Everything looked new and fresh. The bathrooms were above average size. The lobby has a computer to print out your boarding passes, but it was down, so the clerk offered to print them for us. Nice touch on their part. We rented a car, and this hotel is very conveniently located to the strip, and makes a good starting for doing all the touristy stuff. We had no issues parking at any of the casinos and malls. Day trip to the dam and Green Valley was only about 2 hours total, and worth the trip to me, but my daughter was not impressed with driving that far to see a \u201cBrick Wall\u201d holding back water. She would have rather just shopped that day. Did the sign. They have a parking lot now. Guess enough people were killed running across the highway that they decided it would pay for a lot.

You offer to take a picture of the person in front of you with their camera, and then you ask the people behind you to take one of you with your camera, and so on.

We did see Cirque du Soleil KA at the MGM. I will put up another review of it, but we really liked it. I do have to add, that I thought the porn slappers did a very good job of pulling back when my wife and daughter went by.

The hotel is past its prime and the hot water roars like a bull when it's turned on. I am sure my early morning showers disturbed other guests. The entire time the water was running it sounded like a jet engine. The hot water handle on the bathroom sink came off in my hand and I had to screw it back on. The small refrigerator was turned off and smelly when we first checked in, and once I turned it back on it dripped annoyingly through the night and disturbed my sleep. The vending machine on my floor was not well stocked and would not take dollar bills for my entire stay. There are only two guest washing machines for a hotel with 11 guest floors, and I could never find one that wasn't being used. The hotel does not offer a shuttle to the Strip, so if you don't want to face Las Vegas traffic, you're limited to taking the monorail, calling a taxi (none hang around the Embassy Suites) or walking. And while there is a monorail station about four blocks away, the hotel is located in an area of Vegas that borders on seedy, and I would not recommend making that walk at night.

Yes, the suite concept is handy, and the happy hour and breakfast is a nice touch. However, it was difficult to get a drink due to the small bar area and the masses of people bellying up to the bar at Happy Hour. Breakfast was a similar mob scene, and while the food was tasty, the crowded breakfast area was a major drawback for us. We also found the hotel noisy, as all the rooms face the atrium and the noise really travels. Our room was in desperate need of an overhaul - it was dark and gloomy and the living area furniture was soiled and worn. The bathroom really needed some attention - the tile around the shower could have used a good scrub and repair - tiles were loose and some had fallen off. Chunks of grout were missing and the rest was just plain dirty. Thecold water spigot came off in our hands every time we turned the water on, and the toilet paper spent most of its time on the floor, as the dispenser was hanging from one nail. Every time we turned on the water in the bathroom we were met with a loud howling noise from somewhere within the pipes. The room left us with an overall impression of neglect and dinginess. We were looking for a comfortable, quiet off strip hotel experience and this particular Embassy Suites didn't fit the bill, so we left and found a cleaner, well-maintained hotel in a much quieter, less chaotic area. Parking at the hotel wasn't a problem, but it was a bit of a pain to get in and out of their parking lot, as the monorail runs through here and it's easy to miss the turn.

Most of the other rooms had a smaller balcony (but are cheaper).

The room didn't seem to be upgraded any other way, but it was clean and nice. The breakfast was very good and kept us from oversleeping mornings. If we made it the manager reception was good (better then at most Embassy Suites). The staff we encountered were nice. Our cleaning person was nice, and they don't try to get out of cleaning your room each day. They keep a good watch and get you when you leave the room. You don't see them they just clean. I would leave notes with tips as I deemed and were all completed. They even tucked in my daugthers doll.

I honestly have nothing bad to say about this hotel. It's off-strip, non-smoking, and quiet (except for the kids running around at breakfast). The hotel offers a free buffet breakfast, which was pretty good, hot, and with a lot of variety. There was a huge line the day after Thanksgiving, but I think everone wanted to get out to go shopping. The pool was clean and fun, just with a bit too much chlorine. The beds were comfortable, the staff was friendly, and the room was clean. I loved the bath soap, too! We were about 1 mile from the strip, but there were still a few casinos within walking distance, in case the gambling bug strikes. Also, the LV Monorail is just a 5 minute walk, and it's a great, safe and clean way to get to the strip if you don't have a car. There was always a cab sitting outside the hotel, too. If you're going to visit Las Vegas, this a great choice for an off-strip hotel. (The only glitch we experienced was that my mom stayed with the four of us, and has a bad back. We had asked for a rollaway for the room(instead of her using the pull-out couch), and I called a few times during the week prior to our arrival to confirm it. When we arrived at 11pm, there was no rollaway and we were informed that it is Embassy Suites policy not to allow rollaways in rooms with two beds and a pull-out couch, due to space and fire hazard issues.

We drove to all the major casinos; nearly all have free parking and elevators that take you right into the casino (of course). The breakfast was great; a large selection. The only problem during the work week is that they close at 9:00. The manager's reception is a plus; they have plenty of snacks and appetizers, hot and cold. The bar area was kept very clean. Yes, it does get crowded so get there right at 5:30.!! or take your beverages to your room We found the hotel staff very pleasant and gave us a late checkout with no problems. The only down side is that the hotel pool is indoors and being from the wet Pacific Northwest, even the sun in October makes you want to sit out.

What to say: great hotel, very modern, bright atrium reaching 13 floors high and very welcoming ambience, with a cafe / restaurant on the ground floor, as well as a mid-size indoor pool, plus a bar on the first floor balcony. Our room was on 13 ... as high as you can go and wonderful views, even not over the strip itself. Watch out for LAS air traffic turning right on final approach, just outside your window, but not a hint of aircraft noise.

All staff were pleasant and swift in attention, very helpful should you need their assistance, parking out front is included in the rate. What's more - the price puts this as maybe the most attractive hotel in its class in all of Las Vegas ... a definite winner for us and should we be back in Vegas soon, I'd definitely book the Embassy Suites once more.

The Las Vegas Convention Center was within walking distance, however; this is also the nearest monorail stop.", "Date": "December 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cOff the Strip, but convenient to Monorail\u201d", "Author": "DCA", "ReviewID": "UR6341265", "Content": "Stayed here in early December for three nights. Typical Embassy Suites property, maybe near the top of the range for this brand in terms of overall condition of rooms and hotel. If you are a Hilton Hhonors member, this is maybe one of the better choices in town. Location is on Paradise Road, which runs parallel to the Strip (LV Blvd). It is an easy 10-minute walk north to the Convention Center monorail station, and an additional 5 minutes to reach the north hall of the Convention Center. We found it convenient enough for our leisure trip. Tip: across from the monorail station at the SW corner of Paradise and Desert Inn roads is the waiting area for the Wynn shuttle. Our room had a small balcony just wide enough to stand on and get some fresh air. Rooms at the end of the halls on 9th and 10th floors have gigantic balconies with lounge chairs. If you are an Hhonors Diamond member, you might ask to be placed there. Property attracts business travelers and families. Considering the free breakfast and happy hour, it's a good value alternative to a casino property on the strip especially if you are renting a car anyway. Monorail is $5/one way (buy a two-ride ticket for $9...two people can use it), or a taxi to mid-strip (Paris) is $10.", "Date": "December 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cBest non casino hotel\u201d", "Author": "Talkn", "ReviewID": "UR6093621", "Content": "This hotel cannot be beat!!

We slept like babies in the comfy king sized bed!. I have stayed at many Embassy Suites, this one is tops! The breakfast and manager's afternoon (free drinks/snacks) was great! We loved it and it was nice not to be so guarded there unlike the strip(with kids). Room was awesome down to the granite countertops/sink tops. However, no free shuttle to strip.

The hotel is very clean, quite and the breakfast is great for a pleasant start to the day. To enjoy this hotel, rent a car and drive to all of the hotels on the strip plus downtown at night. Once your night is over, drive over to paradise road and over to your hotel. It is very safe to park on the lot and there is a convenience store next door to get any beverages you need. Hotel staff will not go out of there way for you but who cares, you are in vegas. Cechis in is the only time you will deal with them, and that takes less than 5 minutes compared to 1 hour on the strip. Have all of your tourist information before you go or get somewhere else in vegas, hotel has none and staff acts like the do not live in vegas. Remember, rent a car, it only cost about $20.00 per day at thrifty. p.s. get a convertable you will be glad you did", "Date": "October 2, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Embassy Suites Convention Center Las Vegas", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d121330-Reviews-Embassy_Suites_Convention_Center_Las_Vegas-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html", "Price": "$111 - $222*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3600 Paradise Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Las Vegas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NV</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">89169</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "121330", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/10/31/10318cf9648cd69c3fc73a345d3d2cb27large.jpg"}}
