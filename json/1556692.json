We enjoyed staying here because of its warm service, lush morning breakfast and homely atmosphere. The hotel is very conveniently located - about 16 minutes by train to the heart of the city. From Pernety station, it is a comfortable 3 minute walk to the hotel. The streets are lively during the day and moderately well-lit during the night. Infact, on one our late night Paris escapades, we arrived as late as 12 am and there was no issue whatsoever walking through to the hotel. The room was clean, seemed well maintained and slightly cosy in my opinion - however, this is true of a vast majority of hotels in the Paris metropolitan area. The room had a street view and a nice cosy balcony.The bath and shower were modern and efficient though we felt that the bathroom size itself could have been bigger. The walls were a little hollow but that did not bother us much. Also note that there are about 4-5 rooms per floor which is pretty decent for a hotel of this size. The staff is friendly and accommodating. They also helped us with our itinerary plans on a couple of occasions and offered us coffee and take our bags upstairs during our stay. We did not use Room service other than the odd call for a couple of towels and napkins. I must say though that the morning breakfast was delicious and adequate. Please note though that the breakfast is not usually included in the room rate and costs a marginal fee (9 Euros) - well worth the price in our opinion. The breakfast includes delicious homemade jams, croissants, a variety of breads and fruits, cereals and other cold meats. Note that breakfast is served inside the hotel lobby and in the courtyard area. The only one thing that I think there is an opportunity for is that the hotel features a rather tiny elevator and steep stairs since this is a rather narrow building. This may be an issue if you are a disabled traveler. In fact the elevator is small that it was a little difficult to accommodate the 2 of us. Overall, we were happy with our stay and will stay again when we return to our favorite city.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cConvenient and friendly\u201d", "Author": "RLPC", "ReviewID": "UR123928522", "Content": "No frills, convenient, clean and friendly hotel.

The good: Relatively low cost for Paris. Restaurants, market, and metro nearby. Pop, bottled water, coffee for 1.50 euro's. Msr. Antoinne (front desk in the evening) was very helpful and is fluent in English. Mme. Sophie, the owner, seems to thoroughly enjoy running the hotel and tried to be a good host (but was not there much, unfortunately). Free (but spotty and quirky) wi-fi. The bad: Not very clean. We were left towels on two different occasions that had large brown spots on them. Disgusting. The elevator is tiny. It's slightly larger than a coffin. You can't fit more than one person and a piece of luggage in the elevator. No air conditioning. But this is common on Paris, everywhere you go. The French say it doesn't get hot enough in France to need air conditioning. But don't believe them. It gets hot and humid. We did not buy the 9 euro breakfast because it was too expensive. It included bread, pastries (one or two types), ham, cheese, hot drinks, and juice. Most of the staff does not speak English, and it was difficult to communicate with them, even if you know a little French. Msr. Francoise (one of the owners) does not seem to like people. When we checked in, Mme. Sophie took us upstairs to see the alternative rooms they offered (they were painting the family suite we had reserved). My wife asked about leaving the luggage in the lobby, and Msr. Francoise snapped, \"Don't worry about it.\" I'd read other reviews about him, so I was not surprised. One morning Msr. Francoise saw me coming in with pastries from a local boulangier (sp?) for breakfast. To my surprise, he suggested that we eat the pastries in the breakfast area (where the hotel's breakfast is served). We took him up on his offer, which seemed uncharacteristically gracious of him. But his moment of being a good host didn't last long. He kept watching us like a hawk (actually stepping away from his front desk duties to stare at us). It was as if he was afraid we would eat something off the buffet without paying for it--which we would never do. And if he was afraid of that, why did he offer the breakfast room to us? Quite odd. Msr. Francoise also left a lasting impression when we checked out. The day before we left, I had asked Mme. Sophie about a taxi to the airport for the following day. She said she would reserve one for the next day and let me know. When we returned to the hotel that evening, there was nothing indicating that Mme. Sophie had reserved the taxi (no note, no message). I asked Msr. Antoinne at the front desk if Mme. Sophie had made the taxi reservation, and he said that she did not tell him if she did. So, I made my own taxi reservation, with Msr. Antoinne's help. This was about 9 PM. At about midnight, Msr. Antoinne phoned me and told me that Mme. Sophie had just told him that she made the taxi reservation and that it would be 60 euro's. My taxi was only going to be 50 euro's, so I told him I would rather use mine. He said that was fine and that he would cancel the other taxi. The next morning, unfortunately, Msr. Francois was at the front desk when we began the ordeal of getting our luggage down the elevator one piece at a time. Francois asked me first thing whether I had ordered a taxi. I said yes. He said Sophie ordered a taxi and had already prepaid for it. Why you would prepay for a taxi and not tell a guest like you were supposed to, I don't know. I tried to explain to Francois what had transpired when I made the reservation, but he cut me off and said it didn't matter and acted quite disgusted. He apparently canceled the more expensive taxi that Sophie had ordered. When we finally got all our luggage downstairs, I tried to explain to Francois again what had transpired the night before about the taxi and why I had ordered my own. Again he cut me off and said it didn't matter. I finally told him that it did matter and that I wanted him to know what had happened. He listened, looking disgusted, but never apologized and never acknowledged that it was his staff's mistake that caused the misunderstanding. Msr. Francois just does not know how to give good customer service. Overall I would not stay here again due to the unclean conditions (dirty towels left for our use) and Msr. Francois's lack of customer service. There are thousand of other hotels in Paris.

Our room was clean, small, but not as small as some hotels in Paris, the bed was really comfortable and the room provided everything necessary : 4 pillows, 2 nightstands, one chair and a little desk, an airdryer, enough towels, etc. The only \"problem\" is that the bed had no over bedsheet, but only a feather bed (too hot for August).

I do think that the breakfast is a rip off at 9Euros + tax - two streets down is a boulangerie for the essential French pastries et al.

Whether it is owner Sophie Meisel or one of her young assistants and night porters at the front desk (including the inestimable Samy!), the welcome is warm and assistance is friendly.

It sits in a very nice, quiet neighbourhood just south of Montparnasse, full of food shops (bakers, butchers, groceries) and small restaurants. If you are in Paris for tourism, be aware that this is not close to most tourist attractions (Notre-Dame, Tour Eiffel, St-Germain-des-Pres) though the metro will take you there in roughly 15-25 minutes.

We were pretty skeptical about getting some food at around midnight but eventually found an all night pizza parlour just around the corner...The hotel was in a very quiet street, Rue de Gergovie, and was very quickly seen as they had some flags flying outside. The receptionist on arrival was extremely polite and was very pleasant and spoke english. We had missed our flight the night before and we only managed to get there for one night.

The pillows and the sheets were so clean crisp. TV in each room and included CNN news channel, the rest was all french TV (but what do you expect !!).

The receptionist also doubled up as the waiter for the breakfast and cleared one of the tables on the side that was being used for brochures in order for us to sit comfortably. All I would suggest, if you are a tea drinker, then bring your own tea! The only tea they have is Earl Grey and some french Tizzannes....

Also the cemetery is in walking distance if you want a place nearby to jog or run.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "lyon", "Title": "\u201cPush the wall and add a star\u201d", "Author": "weho69", "ReviewID": "UR75389403", "Content": "Great design, nice choices of colors, no street noise if room on the back side, good breakfast and great prices if booked with rebates.

We found the hosts nothing short of delightful and completely charming. In fact, all the staff were wonderful and always ready and willing to help us with anything we needed (directions, travel tips, sightseeing info etc). We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and the hosts gladly arranged a beautiful bunch of flowers in our room for our arrival. The rooms were super clean and fresh which is always on the top of our wish list. The quality of the furnishings, fittings and linens was very high and we had a wall mounted TV in our room. Yes the rooms are relatively small but you'll find that in any major city unless you fork out for five star accommodation. The bathrooms are also tiny but again, we've found this to be the case in almost every capital city boutique hotel we've stayed in (eg. London, New York, Helsinki). Air conditioning would have been great but being in such a quite neighbourhood allowed us to sleep comfortably with the windows open in the summertime. Contrary to previous reviewers, we found the 9 euro breakfast buffet excellent value. Every day we were served fresh baked croissants, baguettes and delicious coffee. Fresh sliced ham and cheese are available for your (divine!) baguettes and a wide selection of quality jams were laid out to slather on the luscious croissants. The hostess even bakes her own cakes which are included in the buffet. There was also a good selection of juices, yoghurt, fresh fruit and cereal. You can sit outside in the lovely grapevine-lined courtyard garden or inside at one of the funky dining tables. The location is great if you don't mind taking the metro into the city (anywhere between 6-8 stops depending on where you're going). The evenings in the neighbourhood were very quiet which is lovely after a long day sightseeing. Just around the corner you'll find a reasonable selection of cafes, bistros, a cheese shop, a few bakeries, and a creperie. The metro Pernety is only a couple of hundred metres away from the hotel which was very handy for our daily adventures. La Maison Montparnasse is a great value boutique hotel where you can feel comfortable and safe while enjoying the city of Paris. We would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFrancoise bourgeois\u201d", "Author": "day_V51", "ReviewID": "UR70899615", "Content": "We stayed at Le Maison Montparnasse for 3 nights at the beginning of our vacation while enjoying some of the sites in Paris.

There is a nice outside Patio for Breakfast consisting of fresh Croissant, Baggett, cheeses, yogurt, juice and coffee, again a typical Petit de jouner. The weekend staff are very helpful as is Sophie (I assume the owner). Franciose on the other hand should probably stick to Kitchen duties and avoid customer contact since his nature is very cold and rude. Not having any experience with Hotels in Paris I went by reviews on Trip Advisor and although not completely dissatisfied would not stay here again as there are other hotels less expensive in just as good a location and no Francoise.

I received a genuinely warm welcome from the owners (a Parisien couple who speak excellent English) and felt everything about this place hit the spot - both in terms of the hotel itself and its fabulous location in a genuinely lively, untouristy and unspoilt part of Montparnasse that had numerous excellent restaurants, cafes, boulangeries etc all within a 5 or 10 minute walk (I'd particularly recommend L'Entrepot, a bistro/bar/cinema that's both stylish & informally friendly). The hotel has been newly refurbished in an understated contemporary 'boutique' style and the high standards of the upkeep and furnishings in my room (a single, which was small but perfectly adequate for my working trip - and I did have quite a bit of luggage with me) made me feel I got great value for my money.
