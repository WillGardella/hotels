I am sorry to say that I don't plan on staying here again and this is why: Being the end of September, it was still in the high 90s during the day and the high 70s/low 80s at night. This meant that I needed the air conditioning on in my room. The problem is, either you are in the North Pole or the Sahara Desert - no in between. The HVAC unit on the floor is right next to the bed. Not only it is very noisy when it is on, there are no dials on the unit for high cool/low cool, high fan/low fan or whatever. All there is is a thermostat unit on the wall. The thermostat has a button for on or auto, and one for heat/cool/off. No high/low fan button. And you can adjust the temperature with the little up/down arrows. Here lies the problem - because you can't put the fan on high or low the unit only has 1 function - blow freezing cold Arctic air out at a high rate and when the room cools to the temperature on the thermostat, it shuts off. No low fan to run. Therefore you are either freezing or boiling in the room. No in between. I got very little sleep the 2 nights I was there because I was up constantly all night adjusting the thermostat. It was terrible!! I would never stay at this hotel again unless they add a high/low button to the thermostat. Other than the HVAC problem and the fact that the bed was right next to the unit (maybe 2 feet from it!) , the hotel was fine. The room was very small but they managed to have a big desk with plenty of room on it and a little armchair & footstool. Small closet. The king size bed was fabulous as were the wonderful feather pillows. The staff were all very nice and the breakfast was good. There was plenty of hot water and good water pressure. I did not have a suite, I just had a standard room.

We stayed in a suite with 2 double beds, it had a rather large bathroom, a nice seperate sitting area with pull out sofa, TV, stereo, desk and 2 chairs. The room is long and thin, but nicely arranged. Breakfast is included in the morning from 6am-10am and includes hot and cold cereals, all kinds of breakfast breads and pastries, fruit, waffels, juice, milk, yogurt etc., it was very good. Lobby staff ok never acknowledge you coming or going, had trouble finding our reservation in the computer too, not the friendliest people. You can hear airplanes here and there. The only real problem at this hotel is that the rooms get very warm unless you keep the air conditioning on (we were there in Jan. it was in the 40's at night), I can't imagine how bad it gets in the summer! The air conditioner is wall controlled and VERY noisy, we would set it low when we would leave the room and always found it back at 76 when we returned! Even with the air on only the bed area really cooled, the living room area where the pull out was stayed pretty warm! They have non-smoking rooms which was nice. The other problem I had was with the staff. When we left the hotel in the morning my daughter left her doll in the room, we know this because we walked straight from the room to the car. We didn't realize the doll was left until we were already on our way. I called the hotel and asked that they go get the doll so a friend could pick it up, I was told to call back. When I called back I was told they could not find the doll. I really don't think anyone looked, I even told them when they would find the doll. It would have just taken a minute to go up to the room and look. My daughter is still upset! Next time i'd drive back and look myself! Just don't leave anything behind and you'll be ok!", "Date": "January 26, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Fairfield Inn & Suites Las Vegas South", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d294797-Reviews-Fairfield_Inn_Suites_Las_Vegas_South-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html", "Price": "$122 - $163*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">5775 Dean Martin Drive</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Las Vegas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NV</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">89118</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "294797", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/c2/e8/8b/fairfield-inn-suites.jpg"}}
